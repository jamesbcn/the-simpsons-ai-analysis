1
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:06,131
The Simpsons.

2
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,126
Aren't you glad we
got out of the house

3
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,003
and came downtown
for a little culture?

4
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:48,423
Heh. They're butchering
the classics.

5
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,967
Could that bassoon have
come in any more late?

6
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,302
Oh, come on, Homer.

7
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,428
There's lasers.

8
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,929
You like lasers.

9
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,806
Laser effects,
mirrored balls...

10
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,809
John Williams must be
rolling around in his grave.

11
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,649
Deviliciously satirical.

12
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,109
I wonder if anyone
else got that.

13
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,445
We're outta here.

14
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,740
Whoa. Careful, now.

15
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,408
These are dangerous streets

16
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,786
for us upper-lower-
middle-class types,

17
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,747
so avoid eye contact,
watch your pocketbook

18
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,415
and suspect everyone.

19
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,500
Three-card monte.

20
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,876
Whoo-hoo! Easy money!

21
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,961
Homer, these games
are fixed.

22
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,922
Then how come
that guy's winning?

23
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,925
Whoa... I, like,
totally won again.

24
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,343
Way to go, bro.

25
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,595
He looks and acts
just like the dealer.

26
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,640
I think they're related,
or at least in cahoots.

27
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,768
Just pick the red card.
It's totally not hard.

28
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,148
20 on this one, my good man.

29
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,150
Sorry, dude.

30
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,610
Black.

31
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,406
Homer, he cheated you!

32
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,702
Surely, you don't blame me.

33
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,371
It's people like you

34
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,873
who are ruining our downtown
promenades and piazzas.

35
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,793
How dare you prey on the greedy
and stupid like this.

36
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:07,919
Buh-bye.

37
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,420
Somebody stop him!

38
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,007
He's getting away!

39
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,592
Come on! Come on!

40
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,969
No! Marge!

41
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,251
Uh, I must warn you...

42
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,378
um... sometimes ordinary people

43
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,006
g-get, uh, uh,

44
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,841
a surge of adrenaline.

45
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,301
Yee...!

46
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,013
See?

47
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,347
Cuff him, boys.

48
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,891
We're putting
this dirtbag away.

49
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:06,811
Huh. I'll be back on the street
in 24 hours.

50
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,397
We'll try to make it 12.

51
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,695
Marge, are you okay?

52
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,071
I think I'm okay.

53
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,699
It was scary, but,
in a weird way,

54
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,201
it was also
kind of exhilarating.

55
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,952
Yes, it is exhilarating

56
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,079
to see the police
get their man

57
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,581
and save
a hysterical woman.

58
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, for crying out loud.

59
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:33,171
Easy now, sweetheart.
Homey's here.

60
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:36,174
Hey, Mom, is this
how you caught him?

61
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:39,344
Face it, Lis,
you're too puny to...

62
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,223
Lisa, unhand your brother.

63
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,310
Yeah, like that
really hurt.

64
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,189
Mom, was catching that guy

65
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,691
the most incredibly exciting
thing you've ever done?

66
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,693
Well, it was
pretty exciting.

67
00:03:55,777 --> 00:04:00,573
But celery soup's
pretty exciting, too.

68
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,329
Mm... mm...

69
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,421
Strange. Regular ham
doesn't thrill me anymore.

70
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:19,425
Hmm. I'm crossing over
to deviled ham.

71
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,057
Whoo!

72
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,533
Marge!

73
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,035
Hey, Mrs. Simpson,
I just got

74
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,829
the new issue of
"Sponge and Vacuum."

75
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,664
Thanks, Benevenstanciano.

76
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,296
Death sports.

77
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,183
All right, get in there.

78
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,435
You're going down.

79
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,686
I want a piece
of him.

80
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,522
You think you're
pretty hot, huh?

81
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,692
Well, we got everything
we need on you.

82
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,193
Excuse me.

83
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:22,030
What? What? What? What?
This better be about pizza.

84
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:26,284
Actually, I'm interested
in becoming a police officer.

85
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:42,800
Welcome aboard.

86
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,345
You did what?!

87
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,055
I borrowed your
nail clipper.

88
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,348
What's the big deal?

89
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,766
Nothing. I'm just
a little edgy

90
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,018
since your mother told me
she wants to be a cop.

91
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,437
Cool. Will you bring me along
when you do evictions?

92
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,397
You got it, little buddy.

93
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,025
Marge, you being a cop
makes you the man!

94
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,318
Which makes me the woman!

95
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,195
And I have no
interest in that...

96
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,197
Besides occasionally
wearing the underwear

97
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,991
which, as we discussed,
is strictly a comfort thing.

98
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,911
Homer, there's no reason
for you to feel threatened.

99
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,914
You'll always be
the man of this house.

100
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,791
Aw, thanks, honey.

101
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,711
All right,
you scrawny beanpoles,

102
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,090
becoming a cop is not something
that happens overnight.

103
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,593
It takes one solid weekend
of training to get that badge.

104
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,011
Forget about the badge!

105
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,013
When do we get
the freakin' guns?!

106
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,265
Hey. I told you,
you don't get your gun

107
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,767
until you tell me
your name.

108
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,854
I've had it up to here
with your "rules"!

109
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,621
Heh. Women always have
trouble with the wall.

110
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,165
Can't ever seem
to find the door.

111
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,245
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
You missed the baby.

112
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,353
You missed
the blind man...

113
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,870
Oh, sorry, Simpson.

114
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,496
Now you'll have to do
the course again.

115
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,249
I was trying to get this
magic eye thing to work.

116
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,335
Ah, look at that! A pony!

117
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,049
Hey, everybody!

118
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,384
Mom's home.

119
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,765
They didn't have my size shirt,
but you get the idea.

120
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,314
Wow, Mom, I never
pictured you

121
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,232
as any kind of
authority figure before.

122
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,358
Marge, I want you

123
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,611
to take care
of yourself out there.

124
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,404
You've become
very dear to me.

125
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,239
Oh, Homey,
of course I will.

126
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,783
Mom, if someone shot at the mayor,
would you have to

127
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,761
throw yourself in front of him
and take the bullet?

128
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,995
I suppose I would.

129
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,371
What if they shot
a Coke machine?

130
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,455
No.

131
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,582
- A TV?
- No.

132
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,209
TV with a picture of
the mayor on it?

133
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,461
Whatever you do, Mom,
we'll be proud of you.

134
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,795
Well, thank you, honey.

135
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,089
As long as it's constitutional.

136
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,343
Homer, give me
my pepper spray.

137
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,888
Aw, Marge. One squirt and
you're south of the border.

138
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,851
Mmm... incapacitating.

139
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,692
All right, settle,
people. People, settle!

140
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,029
People! Wood and Van Zylen,
stake out Donutland.

141
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,323
When they fry up a fresh batch,
call it in.

142
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,158
Keneally and Earhart,
back 'em up.

143
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,577
Fitz and Garcia, it's your turn
to sleep in.

144
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,541
And, Simpson...
Seeing how this

145
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,919
is your first day, you're
inexperienced and vulnerable.

146
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,922
Your beat
is Junkyville and Bumtown.

147
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,221
Hello, Mr. Hutz.

148
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,681
I'll have you know

149
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,325
the contents of that
dumpster are private.

150
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,560
You stick your nose in,
you'll be violating

151
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,478
attorney-dumpster
confidentiality.

152
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,272
I just wanted to say hello.

153
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,108
Hello.

154
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,246
So, you are the new
cop on the beat.

155
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,914
Okay, I know the drill.

156
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,791
What will it be...
100? 200?

157
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:44,792
200.

158
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,836
No, no. I mean, nothing.

159
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,919
I don't take bribes.

160
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,006
Yes, of course you don't.

161
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,633
I will just leave
this money on the table

162
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:56,012
with my unseeing back to
the money, on the table.

163
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,388
Apu, no.

164
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,144
That's better.

165
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,024
This is why
I can't bear

166
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,735
to be in this house!

167
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,321
I got a report on a domestic
disturbance at this address.

168
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,864
Yes, indeed there is.

169
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,699
There's an inflatable
bath pillow

170
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,576
that mother and I
both enjoy.

171
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,870
She claimed it was
her day to use it.

172
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,913
I maintained she was mistaken.
We quarreled.

173
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,041
Later, as I
prepared to bathe,

174
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,001
I noticed to my horror

175
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,795
that someone had
slashed the pillow.

176
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,714
Mm-hmm. Who called
the police?

177
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,132
We both did.

178
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,217
Look, why don't you two
settle down.

179
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,261
I'm sure you can get
another pillow.

180
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,639
Well, I could send it back
to Taiwan for repair.

181
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,350
But why should I have to?
I've done nothing wrong,

182
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,394
and I don't give permission
for my face to be on TV.

183
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,021
I want it blurred.

184
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,981
So Mom,

185
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,584
what are you gonna do
with your day off?

186
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,194
I just want to
relax and forget

187
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,404
that I'm part
of that thin blue line

188
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,366
which stands between
civilization and chaos.

189
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,911
Bart, it's illegal

190
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,163
for you to operate
that class nine vehicle

191
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,706
without pads and a helmet.

192
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,917
- But, Mom...
- It's for your own safety.

193
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,171
Take that,
safety boy.

194
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,715
This padding's
so easy on the knuckles,

195
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,592
I could punch all day.

196
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,764
I just hope they have
Us magazine in heaven.

197
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,767
He said it was his day
to use the tub pillow.

198
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,561
I can't go to the library
anymore, everybody stinks.

199
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,693
Don't stop talking
on account of me.

200
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,569
I may be a cop,
but I'm still your friend.

201
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,990
So, how are you,
Mrs. Krabappel?

202
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,409
Law-abiding.

203
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,576
I'm done.

204
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,665
Moe! I've never seen
you here before.

205
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,000
Well, these days my roots
don't stay

206
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,713
so chestnut on their own,
Officer Simpson.

207
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,090
You don't have
to call me officer.

208
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,174
I'm not on duty here.

209
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,258
Finished.

210
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,889
It looks nice.

211
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,891
It's a good length for you.

212
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,942
Mom's police tape
isn't a toy, Dad.

213
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,569
Shush, dear.

214
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,029
You'll wreck Daddy's fun.

215
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,198
Bringing in the sheaves.

216
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,491
Bringing in...

217
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,868
Oh, my Lord!

218
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,453
Something horrible
has happened!

219
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,791
Fooled you, Flanders!

220
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,502
Made you think
your family was dead.

221
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,591
Did you get it?

222
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,137
- They're not, though.
- No?

223
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,620
- But you thought they were.
- Yeah.

224
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,099
That's why
it was so funny.

225
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,394
- But they're not.
- That's a good one.

226
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,856
And that's the drunk tank,
and this is Mommy's desk.

227
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,816
Mom, I know
your intentions are good,

228
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,777
but aren't the police
a protective force that

229
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,713
maintains the status quo
for the wealthy elites?

230
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,988
Don't you think we ought to

231
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,865
attack the roots
of social problems

232
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,159
instead of jamming people
into overcrowded prisons?

233
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,872
Look, Lisa... it's
McGriff the crime dog.

234
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,749
Hello, Lisa.

235
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,835
Help me bite crime.
Ruff, ruff.

236
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,130
Hey, great news, guys.

237
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,091
I picked up a nudie deck
for our game.

238
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,968
"The Girls of the Internet."

239
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,763
Ooh, I'd go on line
with them any day.

240
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,100
Hey, hey, we've
offended Herman.

241
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,853
No. I'm just going out
for some fresh air.

242
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,856
Geez, that guy sure
likes his fresh air.

243
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,442
None of that for me.

244
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,279
Oh, yeah... yeah.

245
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,781
Hey, Homer,
you sure it's okay

246
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,304
to smoke Cuban cigars
and gamble here

247
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,575
now that your wife's a cop?

248
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,285
Are you kidding?

249
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,704
Being a cop husband
is one mighty sweet deal.

250
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:54,333
This police radio entertains me
with other people's miseries.

251
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,461
We get a free funeral
for Marge... God forbid...

252
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:01,674
And I can run background checks
on whomever I want... Mohammar.

253
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:05,803
Homer, please, please.
Ix-nay on the Ohammar-may.

254
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,972
Hey, hurry up
with the cards, Lenny.

255
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,558
I've got you clocked
at two miles per hour.

256
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,684
Come on, put that away.

257
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,227
Those radar guns
give you cancer.

258
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,855
All the more reason
to hurry up.

259
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,938
Hey, what could be going
a hundred miles per... Oh!

260
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,653
Illegal gambling in my house?

261
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,865
Your house? Your house?

262
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,201
It's so glamorously decorated,
I thought I was in Vegas.

263
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,744
You guys lied to me.

264
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,912
You said it was Vegas.

265
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,873
We'll be going.

266
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,624
We don't want no
trouble here, officer.

267
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,918
Marge, you chased away
all my poker buddies.

268
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,670
I didn't mean to.

269
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,589
You've become such a cop.

270
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,383
Not that long ago, you were
so much more to me.

271
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,052
You were a cleaner of pots,
a sewer of buttons,

272
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,388
an unplugger of hairy clogs.

273
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,015
I'm still all those things.

274
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,684
Only now
I'm cleaning up the city,

275
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,436
sewing together
the social fabric,

276
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,230
and unplugging the clogs
of our legal system.

277
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,815
You're cooking what
for dinner?

278
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,736
Everywhere I look,

279
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,863
someone is breaking the law.

280
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,073
Dog, no leash.

281
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,075
Man, littering.

282
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,578
Horse not wearing diaper.

283
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:16,749
Car parked across
three handicapped spaces.

284
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,959
- Homer!
- Hey, Marge.

285
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,794
How's my little piglet?

286
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,296
Homer, I'm on duty.

287
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,798
That's okay. I'm supposed
to be working too.

288
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,383
You have to
move your car.

289
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,844
I'll just be
a second, Marge.

290
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,008
I'm going to get some beer
for those kids over there.

291
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,767
I'm gonna pretend that
I didn't hear that,

292
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,936
but you have to
move your car now.

293
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,479
I'll be right back.

294
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,898
Now keep your eyes peeled
for a real cop.

295
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,150
That's it. I'm gonna
write you a ticket.

296
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,028
- Come on, we're family!
- You're breaking the law.

297
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,031
I'll make you a deal...
You rip up that ticket,

298
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,616
and I'll give you back
your hat.

299
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,699
- Hey!
- Whoo! Whoo!

300
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,331
Homer!

301
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,125
Taking an officer's cap
is an arrestable offense.

302
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,628
Ooh, what are you gonna do about it?
What are you gonna do?

303
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,505
Ooh, I'm officer Marge.

304
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,881
I'm going to arrest you.

305
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,716
Ooh... What?

306
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,510
Oh, Marge, not here.

307
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,888
Hey, you're not
really arresting me?

308
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,848
You have the right
to remain silent.

309
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,976
I choose to waive that right.

310
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,569
All right, Simpson,
you're free to go.

311
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,280
Let me just finish
this last lobster tail

312
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,364
and raspberry torte.

313
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,328
All right, Hans,
time to go.

314
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,706
But he ate
my last meal.

315
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,642
Well, if that's the worst thing
that happens to you today,

316
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,501
consider yourself lucky.

317
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,878
Are you really allowed
to execute people

318
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,046
in a local jail?

319
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,840
From this point on,
no talking.

320
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,805
I'm sorry I had
to arrest you, Homer,

321
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,724
but what I did was right.

322
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,410
Someday when you really
need it, you'll be happy

323
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,477
there are dedicated cops
like me out there.

324
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,479
I have nothing more
to say to you, Marge.

325
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,443
I'm drawing a line
down the center of the house,

326
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,066
a la "I Love Lucy."

327
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,319
You stay on your side,
and I'll stay on my side.

328
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,198
Boy, when Marge
first told me

329
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,492
she was going to
the Police Academy,

330
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,953
I thought it would be
fun and exciting, you know,

331
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,955
like that movie...
"Spaceballs."

332
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,433
But, instead, it's been
painful and disturbing

333
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,292
like that movie
"Police Academy."

334
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,336
Homer, I'm worried
about the beer supply.

335
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,714
After this case
and the other case,

336
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,507
there's only one case left.

337
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,509
Yeah, yeah. Barney's right.

338
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,387
Yeah.
Let's get some more beer.

339
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,282
Yeah. What about some beer?
Yeah, Barney's right.

340
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,308
All right, guys, pipe down.

341
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,310
I got some more in the garage.

342
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,146
I'll get it
for you, Homer.

343
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,608
Hmm. I wonder why he's so eager
to go to the garage.

344
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,402
The garage?
Hey, fellas, the garage.

345
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,238
Ooh, la-di-da,
Mr. French man.

346
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,490
What do you call it?

347
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,573
A car hole.

348
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,789
You're late, Herman.

349
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,707
Surely, you don't mind

350
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,085
waiting for merchandise
of this quality, Mr. Jericho.

351
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,253
Huh. Looks like
good stuff.

352
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,090
But, of course, I'll
have to sample it first.

353
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:14,635
- These are fabulous.
- Yeah.

354
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:18,806
Who would suspect that
they're counterfeit jeans?

355
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,808
And what better place
to make the buy

356
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,518
than in a cop's garage

357
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,353
where no one would
suspect a thing.

358
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,654
Herman, I had to come out here
to see what's so funny.

359
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,342
A counterfeit jeans ring
operating out of my car hole!

360
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,909
I'm gonna tell everyone.

361
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:39,993
Wait here.

362
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,662
Not so fast.

363
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,038
Okay.

364
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,708
Maybe you should
just stop entirely.

365
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,212
Herman, how could you?

366
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,422
We've all thought about
counterfeiting jeans

367
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,217
at one time or another,
but what about the victims?

368
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,719
Hardworking designers
like Calvin Klein,

369
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,722
Gloria Vanderbilt,
or Antoine Bugle Boy.

370
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,725
These are the people who saw
an overcrowded marketplace

371
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,269
and said, "me too."

372
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,271
Advance on him, men.

373
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:10,482
I don't think that's
a very good idea.

374
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,900
Oh, no.

375
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,652
It's Gloria Vanderbilt,
out for revenge.

376
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:18,073
No. It's Officer Simpson,
of the police.

377
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,706
Herman, your beef
is with me.

378
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,957
Leave the girl out of this!

379
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,083
Okay.

380
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,668
Homer!

381
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,253
It's too late for me, Marge.

382
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,338
Sell the jeans
and live like a queen!

383
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,010
Is Bart home?

384
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,928
Just taking Maggie
for a stroll.

385
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,435
Well, I guess I am putting up
the Halloweenie decorations

386
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,644
a little early.

387
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,438
Criticism accepted.

388
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,398
Marge!

389
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,069
Bust him, Mom!

390
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,321
Go back to bed.

391
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,406
Don't make me
come up there.

392
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,788
Looks like your wife

393
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,916
is embarking
up the wrong tree.

394
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,129
Freeze!

395
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,756
Every mother knows

396
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,674
the secret entrance
to her son's tree house.

397
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:21,011
Oh, Marge, you saved my life.

398
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,930
I'm sorry
I teased you.

399
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,932
You're a really
good cop.

400
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,059
I'm proud of you.

401
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,395
So long. Got to catch the 501.

402
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,521
He's getting away!

403
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:32,773
You blew it, Marge!

404
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,149
I don't think so.

405
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,943
Oh, foiled by my own

406
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,403
shoddy merchandise!

407
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,465
That's my ambulance.
I called for it four hours ago.

408
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,909
- Marge, how did you know...
- That the pants would rip?

409
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,970
- No. What I was wondering...
- Years of buying pants

410
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,121
for two active children
and a full-seated husband

411
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,707
has given me a sixth sense
for shoddy stitching,

412
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,918
which these jeans
have in spades.

413
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,419
That's some
nice work, Simpson,

414
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,463
but we can't hold him...
There's no evidence.

415
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,827
Yes, there is. There's a garage
full of counterfeit jeans.

416
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,926
Uh, they've, uh,
mysteriously disappeared.

417
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,264
- Looking good, boys.
- That's it.

418
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,724
There's too much corruption
on this force.

419
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,934
I quit.

420
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,406
Sorry to lose you,
Simpson.

421
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,827
I don't think
they're coming back.

422
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,370
Well, that does it.
That does it.

423
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,871
I'm looking at his cards.

424
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,999
Ah, crap. I fold.
