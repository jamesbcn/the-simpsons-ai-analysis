00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,473
{\an8}Is there any
better feeling

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,050
{\an8}than waiting for a live
Krusty show to start?

5
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,756
{\an8}Maybe watching your bride
coming down the aisle.

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:14,967
{\an8}Hmm.

{\an8}Check.

{\an8}-Nope. 11.

16
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,626
{\an8}My comedy comes
from taking risks.

17
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,632
{\an8}Or avoiding them.
I can't remember.

18
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,304
{\an8}Krusty, we need to talk.

19
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,802
{\an8}Make it fast.

20
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,554
{\an8}I've got a coiled-up spring
ready to boi-oi-oi-oi-oing.

{\an8}Oh, why can't I be funny
with just my words?

{\an8}Bill Maher doesn't put dangerous
things near his crotch,

00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,273
{\an8}except when he's off work.

24
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,903
{\an8}(laughs)
Yeah.

25
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,360
{\an8}It's about your vodka,
Absolut Krusty.

26
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,361
{\an8}We're having trouble
persuading people

27
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,533
{\an8}it's hip to drink a vodka
made by a clown,

28
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,452
{\an8}in a bottle shaped
like a clown,

29
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,120
{\an8}that does this
when you open it.

{\an8}-(ooga horn sounds)

{\an8}Always gets me.

32
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,785
{\an8}Yeah, plus, that TV special

33
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,210
{\an8}where you drank another brand
of vodka didn't help.

34
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,539
{\an8}I used up my stuff
poisoning deer.

35
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,165
{\an8}If we're ever gonna
sell your vodka,

36
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,301
{\an8}we need to do something
completely unorthodox--

37
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,048
{\an8}a viral marketing campaign.

38
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,380
{\an8}(metallic creaking)

39
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,545
{\an8}Get to the point!

40
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,473
{\an8}Unless you want a face
full of clown chunks!

41
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,551
{\an8}People are more likely
to drink your vodka

42
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,967
{\an8}if they think all their
coolest friends are drinking it.

43
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,806
{\an8}So, we pay for a big party

44
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,681
{\an8}at the home of a
Springfield trendsetter.

45
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,478
{\an8}Your Brockman,
your Bumblebee Man...

46
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,272
{\an8}He invites his cool friends,
we serve free cocktails,

47
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,897
{\an8}made with your vodka,
generating buzz.

48
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,324
{\an8}We got buzz.

49
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,742
{\an8}Positive buzz.

50
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,821
{\an8}That exists? Wow.

51
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,946
{\an8}So, all you have to do is find
one of your loyal fans

52
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,204
{\an8}whose house we can trash
and friends you can exploit.

{\an8}(gasps, grunts)

55
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,543
{\an8}I need a drink.

56
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,254
{\an8}Not that!
Never that!

-Hey, hey, kids!

58

{\an8}Who wants to host
a viral marketing event?

00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,415
{\an8}ALL: Yay!

60
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,468
{\an8}All you have to do
is write me a letter

61
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,182
{\an8}about how hip and influential
your parents are.

62
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,273
{\an8}Milhouse, I'm gonna
win that thing.

63
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,718
{\an8}How do you know, Bart?

64
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,848
{\an8}Maybe for once I'll win.

65
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,345
{\an8}Children of troubled marriages
not eligible.

66
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,857
{\an8}Oh!

{\an8}(birds singing)

68
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,190
{\an8}So, uh,
why are you here?

69
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,356
{\an8}Is it about that unauthorized
Krusty look-alike

70
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,074
{\an8}I hired for Lisa's
first communion?

71
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,195
{\an8}What was his name?

72
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,161
{\an8}Krappy the Klunk. See?

73
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,951
{\an8}Homer, we're here
to throw the most redonkulous

74
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,075
{\an8}marketing outreach
this town's ever seen.

75
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,833
{\an8}All you have to do is invite
every cool person you know.

76
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,665
{\an8}Hey, I wrote the application.

77
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,170
{\an8}Do any of my friends get
to come?

78
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,422
{\an8}One friend.

79
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,213
{\an8}He can listen to music
with headphones on,

80
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,967
{\an8}he gets one slice
of cheese pizza,

81
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,298
{\an8}and if the party
gets slow,

82
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,763
{\an8}he has to pretend to let
Krusty save him from drowning.

83
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,264
{\an8}-Redonkulous!
-Off the dilge!

{\an8}This party is so much better
than the crummy ones we plan.

00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,185
{\an8}(laughs)

89
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,356
{\an8}I hope Bart's having fun.

90
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,735
And that's why John Gielgud
is more of a father to me

91
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,243
than my own father.

92
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,155
Where's the nachos
you promised?

93
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,463
There'll be time enough
for nachos!

94
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,788
Why can't I go to
the grown-up room?

95
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,464
You said the clown scared you.

96
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,053
Well, he did a little.

97
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,708
(crowd chatter and laughter)

98
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,836
Boy, everyone from the
nuclear plant is here.

99
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,514
Except the bosses,
of course.

100
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,262
Yeah, even Homer's not dumb
enough to invite...

101
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,885
BURNS:
So, this is the famous party.

102
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,932
Feh. Guh.

103
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,976
Pffoy.

104
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,810
(crowd chatter)

105
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,944
He's destroying
our youthful demographic!

106
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,065
Oh, God, I need a drink!

107
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,280
So the car in front of us
forgot to validate his... uh...

108
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,405
(laughs)
I was in an anecdote once.

109
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,953
Um, I have surgery
in the morning.

110
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,537
Yeah, and I'm the one
having the surgery.

111
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,253
(sighs)

112
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,093
Homer, you're the nominal host.
Do something!

113
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,129
Oh! Uh! Oh!

114
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:19,628
Mr. Burns,
so glad you're here.

115
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,507
Finally, the party
can get started.

116
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,934
Your cotillion seems
to be in full promenade.

117
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,433
(laughs)
Good one.

118
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,885
Uh, Mr. Burns, everyone is dying
to hear you sing karaoke.

119
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,597
Come on,
just pick a popular song.

120
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,728
Do you have anything
by Prince...

121
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,395
Wilhelm of Prussia?

122
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,533
I have 16 million songs,
but, uh, no.

123
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:42,741
Just play the oldest,
stupidest thing in your catalog.

124
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,334
Uh, let me check
my beeswax cylinders.

125
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,080
Uh, here we are.

126
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:50,211
<i>♪ Come, Josephine,</i>
<i>in my flying machine! ♪</i>

127
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,040
<i>♪ Going up she goes,</i>
<i>up she goes ♪</i>

128
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,797
<i>♪ Balance yourself</i>
<i>like a bird on a beam ♪</i>

129
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,969
<i>ALL: ♪ In the air she goes,</i>
<i>there she goes ♪</i>

130
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,140
-(applause and cheering)
-(Mr. Burns chuckles)

131
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,179
May you all fly
in an aeroplane someday.

132
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,314
You certainly seem to be
enjoying yourself, sir.

133
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,101
Indeed.
That Homer Simpson

134
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,194
is the beating baboon heart
of this party.

135
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,570
So he says, "Bigamy is having
one too many wives."

136
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,778
To which I replied,
"So's monogamy."

137
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,320
-(laughter)
-Oh, yeah!

138
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,614
I may have a use for
this Simpson character

139
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,068
higher up in the organization.

140
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,368
Really?
Well, as safety inspector,

141
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,202
he hasn't exactly
set the world on fire,

142
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,247
although he came close
several times.

143
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,581
(crow caws)

144
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,915
Simpson, you're probably
wondering why you're here.

145
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,172
It's never good. I always wind up
being chased by hounds,

146
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,795
or falling
through a trapdoor,

147
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,592
or being a peg in your game
of human croquet.

148
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,966
When I made you a hoop,
you split your pants.

149
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,644
Now, here at the plant,
there's no position more important

150
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,893
than our accounts man,
who's responsible

151
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,435
for glad-handing our
customers and suppliers.

152
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,019
I'd like you to take over
that position.

153
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,435
The last thing I understood
in that was "pants."

154
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,074
Just give me your answer,
and make it quick!

155
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,691
Our current account man,
Robert Marlowe here,

156
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,448
is retiring at the
end of the month.

157
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,739
In two weeks, the only tie
I'll be wearing is

158
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,833
for autoerotic pleasure.

159
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,119
Yes. Simpson,
only you have the bonhomie

160
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,253
and rotund charm
to replace him.

161
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,630
It means a hefty expense account
and a corner office.

162
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,088
Well, in that case...

163
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,339
Before you say yes, Simpson,
I feel it's my duty to warn you,

164
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,422
account men lose their soul.

165
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,838
Woo-hoo!
No more church!

166
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,885
(door squeaks open and shut)

167
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,135
So long, Sector 7-G.

168
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,108
Hello, Sector 22-F!

169
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,281
(elevator bell dings)

170
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,150
(gasps)

171
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,735
(sizzling)

172
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,576
(giggling)

173
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,081
(moans)

174
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,461
The higher they rise,
the further they fall!

175
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,717
You know,
you're kind of a downer.

176
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,469
I thought you were retiring.
Why are you still here?

177
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,222
Hey, you're a baby
account man.

178
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,723
Still on the bottle.

179
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,555
So, for my last good deed
before I retire,

180
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,481
I'm going to help you
persuade Mayor Quimby

181
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,400
to sign off on
a nuclear rate hike.

182
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,018
Uh-oh, a meeting
with the mayor.

183
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,435
How do I prepare for that?

184
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,904
(chuckles)

185
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,364
I see.

186
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,324
Now, how do I prepare
for the meeting with the mayor?

187
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,868
I am really enjoying this,
but, um...

188
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,201
Hello!
Meeting with the mayor?

189
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,365
(glass breaking)

190
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,787
Aw. Bourbon go bye-bye.

191
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,586
There ain't enough bourbon
in Kentucky for you, big guy.

192
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,380
Yeah, the governor wrote me
a letter to that effect.

193
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,602
Wow, I can't believe I'm eating
steak with the mayor.

194
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,558
The next time I vote for you,
it's gonna be on purpose.

195
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,809
Much obliged.

196
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,391
Now, uh, where would you like

197
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,396
to discuss
your proposed tax breaks?

198
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,939
(laughing)

199
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,363
Mmm.

200
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,571
Hey, Homer!

201
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,820
Look at you, man!

202
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,572
(loud whisper)
I've outgrown you!

203
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:12,163
Oh, Mr. Mayor,
more "peanut nore"?

204
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,741
(knocking on window)

205
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,254
(glass squeaking)

206
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,042
(both grunt)

207
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,126
Say what you will, man.

208
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,711
He's pretty resourceful.

209
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,545
-(cheering)
<i>-HOMER: Wow.</i>

210
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,051
These seats are amazing.

211
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,472
And if you don't like the score,
you can change it yourself.

212
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,511
(click)

213
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,354
HOMER:
Boring!

214
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,889
(click)

215
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,102
God, what a great game!

216
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,642
And you, too, can be on
the winning team, Mr. Mayor.

217
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,726
The Springfield Nuclear Team.

218
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,941
I have never heard an analogy
involving sports!

219
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,733
I love it!

220
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,736
I can't believe
that was work!

221
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,318
Yeah, but work is over now.

222
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,243
Want to drink with me
till I fall asleep?

223
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,202
Oh, well...

224
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:57,042
Mm, I really should look
at this picture a little longer.

225
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:00,039
Hmm.
Okay, let's go.

226
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,632
Great. Now, in honor of my
last day on the hamster wheel,

227
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,248
I have a little
gift for you.

228
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,045
This set of bar tools
has been passed down

229
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,918
from account man to account man
since the dawn of history.

230
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,836
1956.

231
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,835
Can you be my dad?

232
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,757
If your mom was a secretary,
there's a good chance I am.

233
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,926
(tires squealing)

234
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,095
(sighs)

235
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:22,693
Welcome home, handsome!

236
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,440
(both moan)

237
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,982
(laughs)

238
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,105
It's a rat race,
but it looks like I won.

239
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:32,823
-Oh, to the victor go the spoils.
-Mmm.

240
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,575
Dad, you were supposed
to read me a bedtime story.

241
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,368
Oh, sorry, sweetie.
Bart can read it to you.

242
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,792
(Homer and Marge laugh)

243
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,460
Read to Lisa? Why don't you
just ask me to kiss her?

244
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,710
If you kissed her,
that would be lovely.

245
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,042
-I'll read! I'll read!
-And kiss.

246
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,838
Does anyone want
my opinion?

247
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,471
Please, Lisa.
I had 18 martinis today.

248
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,089
MARGE:
Hello.

249
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:57,425
All right, Lis, let's get this stupid
bedtime story over with.

250
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,853
Proceed to the page with
the butterfly bookmark

251
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,022
as I cuddle up
with Madam Bunny.

252
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,481
(clears throat)

253
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:07,441
"If genn-i-oos..."

254
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,773
Genius.

255
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,148
"...is eternal pati...

256
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,816
pat-eh...

257
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:14,914
pa-tie..."

258
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,699
Patience. Patience!
Get on with it!

259
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,243
Shut up! Shut up!
I'm a bad reader, okay?!

260
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,578
-Well, I could help you.
-I don't want your help!

261
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,334
I'll get one of those jobs
where you don't need to read,

262
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,457
like French fry maker
or general.

263
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,634
-Well, you're getting my help.
-Forget it.

264
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,263
Don't you want to be able
to read the things

265
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,470
people carve into your chest
in prison?

266
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,800
I guess.

267
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,885
♪♪

268
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,320
Close enough.

269
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,703
(sighs)

270
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,034
"But when the helpful voice
was silent,

271
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,743
the daily lesson over,
the beloved presence gone,

272
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,954
and nothing remained
but loneliness and grief,

273
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,954
then Jo found her promise
very hard to keep."

274
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,867
We did it, Bart.

275
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,126
-(groans)
-I'm a mentor.

276
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,128
Big deal, you taught me
to read one book.

277
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,210
No, Bart, you can read
other books, too.

278
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,456
What?!

279
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,045
Homie,
what are you doing?

280
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,428
My work is
so meaningless.

281
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,095
You make electricity.

282
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,143
It runs the hospital.

283
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,307
You can't touch
electricity, Marge,

284
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,726
you can't feel it.

285
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,904
That's because
it would kill you.

286
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,193
It already is killing me,
Marge.

287
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,857
You're the only one
I can talk to.

288
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,065
My wife just
doesn't get it.

289
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,566
I'm your wife.

290
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,867
My job is my wife,

291
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,000
loneliness-- my mistress,
despair-- my sex buddy.

292
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,999
Angst is a chick
I met online,

293
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,131
but then it turned out
it was really a guy.

294
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,418
I'm going to bed.

295
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,091
You don't understand me.

296
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,260
Only she understands me.

297
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,923
Another round, kid?

298
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,930
(squeaks)

299
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:58,403
Hey, uh...
I got here after you did.

300
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,454
I'm sorry to bother you at home,
Mr. Marlowe,

301
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,794
but my husband's
acting pretty odd--

302
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,620
coming home late,
drinking in the morning.

303
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,956
-Wake me when you get to "odd."
-Hmm.

304
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,132
I don't suppose you'd consider
taking your old job back

305
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,132
so Homie can go back
to his old job?

306
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,795
Sorry, Marge,
that account job hollowed me out

307
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,473
like a cheap chocolate bunny.

308
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,141
I've been divorced three times,
I've got a cocktail addiction,

309
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,811
a shrimp cocktail addiction,

310
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,309
and I can't stop bending women
to my sexual will.

311
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:33,651
Well, you certainly
won't be bending me...

312
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,149
Wait, how did I end up
in your bedroom?

313
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,242
Lady, I am smoother than
an Eisenhower-era freeway.

314
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,648
Look, I came to talk
about my husband, and...

315
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,737
How did we get in here?

316
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,323
I think better
in the shower.

317
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,657
There's room in here for two.

318
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,252
I'm a happily married woman.

319
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,828
Wow, no woman's ever done
that to me before.

320
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,584
Your husband
is a lucky man.

321
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,916
I know,
and I don't want him to stray

322
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,251
from anything except his diet,

323
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,257
and I don't really
want him to do that.

324
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,260
Marge, I made
a big mistake years ago.

325
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,842
I gave up on my family.

326
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,097
Then I gave up on my
secret other family.

327
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,719
I missed my son's graduation,
my father's funeral,

328
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,347
and my dog's
best in show.

329
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,893
Don't let Homer make
the mistakes I did.

330
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,518
Luann?

331
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,904
It's not what you think.

332
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,691
It's much weirder.

333
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,740
You're reading
a chapter book.

334
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,321
For fun!

335
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,826
Bullies, to me.

336
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,238
(both grunt)

337
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,576
Let's see the name
of this wedgie ticket.

338
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,712
-(gulps)
<i>-Little Women?</i>

339
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,669
Are you aware that's another way
of saying "girls"?

340
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,420
Look, I had to read it
to my sister.

341
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,592
Well, maybe
we should hear a little.

342
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,551
And then maybe you'll be hearing
from my sisters.

343
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,762
Your fists are sisters?

344
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,933
Yeah, Poke-ahontas
and Sock-ajawea!

345
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,143
-Nice save.
-Get reading.

346
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,440
"And Amy and Jo hugged
one another close,

347
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,059
and everything was forgotten
in one hearty kiss."

348
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,028
End of chapter eight.

349
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,188
You can't stop now.

350
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,316
I want to know if their father
comes home.

351
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,533
Does Jo learn to handle
her hasty temper?

352
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,034
Does Amy get over
her conceitedness?

353
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,786
Aw, come on, guys,
it's getting dark.

354
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:15,499
Okay, but you better be here
tomorrow after school.

355
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,581
'Cause we're going to
keep making you read us

356
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,246
a lame ol' girl's book.

357
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,335
(laughter)

358
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,090
Bart needs to work
on differentiating

359
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,422
the character voices
a little better.

360
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,257
I know, I keep going,
"Why is Meg saying that?"

361
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,394
and then I realize it's Beth.

362
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,721
-(all agreeing)
-That's right.

363
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,095
(Homer grunting)

364
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,233
(intercom buzzes)

365
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,020
<i>RECEPTIONIST:</i>
<i>Your wife is here, Mr. S.</i>

366
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,153
(whispering loudly)
Tell her I'm at a meeting, not drinking.

367
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,441
<i>This is a whisper-amplifying</i>
<i>intercom.</i>

368
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,235
-(screams)
-Homer, I want you to come

369
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,109
with me and the kids
on a family vacation.

370
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,317
Of course, of course.

371
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,946
Family is everything
to us company men.

372
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,160
Now, where shall we go
on your vacation?

373
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:58,245
The farthest thing from
this office I know:

374
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,342
{\an8}rafting down Rattler River Canyon.

375
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,462
{\an8}(Homer whimpers)

376
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,045
That's great--
let me run the numbers

377
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,920
'cause I really want
the Simpson account.

378
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,467
And give these cigars
to your children.

379
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,931
Don't talk to me
like I'm a client.

380
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,892
You're not a client,
you're <i>the</i> client.

381
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,644
(groans)

382
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:20,055
Simpson, put on your
charm-their-pants-off pants.

383
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,055
The mumpish oafs
in Washington are sending

384
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,317
their sternest band
of nuclear regulators,

385
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,440
handpicked to resist
all blandishment.

386
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,447
I'll handle it, I always do.

387
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,909
Rafting, eh?

388
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,989
It's a perfect way
to entertain them.

389
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,204
Finally, humanity has found
a use for water.

390
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,615
Mr. Burns, I can't go
rafting with you because--

391
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,996
wait a minute,
could this all work?

392
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,591
<i>HOMER:</i>
<i>Oh, no, you don't.</i>

393
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,013
Coggily-doggily.

394
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,641
It all fits.
Mr. Burns, rafting it is.

395
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,639
Excellent.

396
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,140
But Mr. S.,

397
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,601
you just promised this week
to Mrs. S., Master B.,

398
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,142
and Mamselles L. and M.

399
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,595
Now, relax, Dottie.

400
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,765
Leave everything to me.

401
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,484
(grunts)

402
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,199
Oh, Marge, this is
the most romantic trip

403
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,989
you ever nagged me into.

404
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,122
And maybe
when we get home,

405
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,789
we can ride down
something else.

406
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,789
Not sure what you're
going for, but...

407
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,211
(lusty growl)

408
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,963
(gasps)

409
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,796
Uh, Marge, why don't I
catch us some salmon?

410
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,629
(grunting)

411
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,974
D'oh!

412
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,049
(grunting)

413
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,594
It's about time.

414
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,557
We've been making small talk
about Mussolini for 15 minutes.

415
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,968
Well, I, uh, found
that contact lens I was missing.

416
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,978
Let me just screw her back in.

417
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,480
(pained grunting)

418
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,688
So, everybody good?

419
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,605
Why did you get us...

420
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,492
<i>Diversity Kittens</i>
<i>on Meltingpot Mountain?</i>

421
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,910
<i>It's more fun to play</i>
<i>with a ball of yarn</i>

422
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,449
<i>if it has all the colors in it.</i>

423
00:17:56,533 --> 00:18:00,373
<i>And yarn should be allowed</i>
<i>to marry dental floss.</i>

424
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,173
If you've got that, then...

425
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,965
<i>Are you sure</i>
<i>you're Martin Scorsese?</i>

426
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:12,929
(Homer grunts)

427
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,428
Enjoy the outdoors,
you stupid kid.

428
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,681
(worried grunting)

429
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,062
This family time is so precious.

430
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,768
Got to go.

431
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,098
(panting)

432
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,443
(murmurs suspiciously)

433
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,809
(grunting)

434
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,055
(unzips, hums)

435
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,186
(zips up)

436
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,692
(grunting)

437
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,694
(grunts wearily)

438
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,775
Homer, I want
a Long Island ice tea,

439
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,860
America's most
complicated cocktail.

440
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,735
Homer,

441
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,075
are you schmoozing those men?

442
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,581
(alarmed shriek)

443
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,253
Huh?

444
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,921
Um, I think we're supposed
to get off here.

445
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,540
Take us out first.

446
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,207
Anyone can start a family.

447
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,335
These days
no one can find a job.

448
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,842
Let's see, my family
gives me love and sex.

449
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,675
My work gives me
money and sleep.

450
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,930
Hurry, we're heading
for the falls!

451
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,769
My coworkers are like a family,

452
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,810
but in some ways
my family is like a family, too.

453
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:09,404
For God's sakes, Homer,
I've given you three children.

454
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,981
Whose side are you on?

455
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:15,316
Yours, Homie,
I'm always on yours.

456
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,453
How ironic.

457
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,695
I survived the <i>Titanic</i>
by making a raft

458
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,827
out of steerage passengers,
and now this.

459
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,705
MARLOWE:
Mr. Burns, your heart will go on.

460
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,511
(all screaming)

461
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,799
Marlowe, I thought
you retired.

462
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:39,013
I can't-- Treasury bills
are paying nothing. Nothing!

463
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,644
Well, Simpson,
you were willing

464
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,681
to let me go
over a waterfall,

465
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,814
but you cut operating expenses
by six percent,

466
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,942
-so you're forgiven.
-Thanks.

467
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,479
Now if you'll
excuse me,

468
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,272
I don't really like bourbon
or business talk,

469
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,566
just good old
Simpson family fun.

470
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,241
Hey, kids, I'm it.

471
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,860
(laughter)

472
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,454
(grunting)

473
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,623
Aah!

474
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,621
(screams)

475
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,376
I'm okay,
and I found some gold!

476
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,419
See, luckiest man
in the world.

477
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,964
Oh, I'm so glad

478
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,838
you're not an accounts man anymore.

479
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,716
Yep, your worries
are over.

480
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,312
I'm back to being
a boring old safety inspector

481
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,388
at a nuclear power plant.

482
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,734
(both moaning)

483
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,737
-(murmuring)
-Shh!
