1
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,599
D'oh!

2
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,466
Worst couch gag ever.

3
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:31,624
Why do we have to go to the rec center?
I want to play with my friends!

4
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,627
When you're older,
you'll miss these fun activities.

5
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:37,664
You're older.
Why don't you do these fun activities?

6
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,166
Because no one's making me. Bye-bye!

7
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:46,439
Welcome to Shaolin Kung Fu.
Ten thousand years of knowledge...

8
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,942
...will be passed along to those
whose parents have signed...

9
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,010
...a permission slip.

10
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,780
The rest of you have just purchased
very expensive pajamas.

11
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,887
Pardon me, master.
But what does a big fat wad like you...

12
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,756
...know about Kung Fu?

13
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:07,260
Kung Fu is not about physique
but the channeling of one's energy,

14
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,029
or chi.

15
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:14,399
If you doubt my skill,
please feel free to attack at my signal.

16
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,805
My chi!

17
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,920
Do we have any more paints?
My orange isn't the orange of that orange.

18
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,524
Just paint the damn fruit!
- Lower your expectations, Lisa.

19
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,026
Public program, public program.

20
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:43,721
TEACHER: Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

21
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:47,965
Stop! Stop! Juliet, this is terrible!

22
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,103
Your art is personal and wrong!

23
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:53,673
I was painting
with my heart. And if you look carefully,

24
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,775
you can see
that the knight is Josh Groban,

25
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,877
our young century's greatest vocalist.

26
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,977
Oh! Another Grobanite.

27
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,785
Excuse me. But I think
her painting is very imaginative.

28
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,221
I suppose you'd like to teach this class!

29
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:14,356
Yes, I would. Class, everyone, please
stop and admire Juliet's painting.

30
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:17,864
I do not need this!
My family owns a gas station!

31
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,968
If you two thoughtful and creative girls
don't like the way I teach,

32
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,788
there's a world of fun, outside.

33
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:27,640
See you!

34
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:32,178
What are you staring at?
Everyone paint me twenty laps!

35
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,355
Come on, fatty! Keep up!

36
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,089
So how come I've never seen you around...

37
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,892
...the Janet L. Munoz Robbins
Rec Center before?

38
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:49,696
My father just took a position
at Springfield University.

39
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,297
Are your parents academics?

40
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,264
Kinda.
Let's do some Groban.

41
00:03:56,135 --> 00:04:00,731
Everybody wants
- Everybody wants...

42
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,401
To be understood
- To be understood...

43
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:11,048
Well, I can hear you
- Well, I can hear you...

44
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:17,117
Everybody wants
- Everybody wants...

45
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:20,090
To be loved
- To be loved...

46
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:25,692
Don't give up
- Don't give up...

47
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:33,037
Because you are loved
- Because you are loved

48
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,678
I need some candy for a first play date,
but I don't want to come on too strong.

49
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,778
M&M'S?

50
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:41,347
Well, if I pick plain,
she'll think I'm cheap.

51
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,516
But if I pick peanuts,
she may have an allergy.

52
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,085
You just killed her, Bart!
- How about Charleston Chew?

53
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,788
What is this? Brooklyn in the fifties?
Don't just say stuff.

54
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,057
You ask for my help
then you don't want it.

55
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,760
Excuse me.
But why not consider an Almond Joy.

56
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,629
It looks like you only brought
something for yourself.

57
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,365
But then you just happen to have
two pieces!

58
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,729
Finally a real suggestion!

59
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,771
If she doesn't like coconut,
you're screwed!

60
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,871
Mmm.

61
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,409
Oh.

62
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,984
Hi, Juliet.
- So what do you want to do?

63
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,084
I don't know.

64
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:21,254
It's been so long since
I've had a play date.

65
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,823
Not that I couldn't get one if I wanted.

66
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:27,260
My parents bought me a membership card
to the Folk Art Museum.

67
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,162
Does it get you into special exhibits?

68
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,992
On Wednesdays.
- That's today!

69
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,298
...

70
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,367
...Folk art

71
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,530
So Lisa asked if her new friend
could stay for dinner.

72
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,968
She's finally doing something
the book said she would.

73
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,069
Won't last.

74
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,010
Hey, Mom. Can Juliet sleep over?

75
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,646
Are your parents okay with that?
They never met us.

76
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,080
We could be murderers.

77
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,325
Could've been, if we hadn't had kids.

78
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:27,887
Juliet's father is the world's foremost
John Grisham scholar.

79
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:31,024
He found several undiscovered plot twists
in The Client,

80
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,459
and he proved that the real villain
in A Time to Kill...

81
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,161
...is the legal system itself.

82
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,752
Told you, Marge. Told you!

83
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,303
Now we need a name
for our imaginary kingdom...

84
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,403
I mean, queendom.

85
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,563
How about Equalia?

86
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,674
Equalia.

87
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:54,611
Where everyone is equal
but we're in charge.

88
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,016
I mean, somebody has to be, right?

89
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,380
Okay, you two. Lights out.

90
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,057
Lisa, do you want to be best friends?

91
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,659
Gosh, this is all happening so fast.

92
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,994
I don't know what to say.

93
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,729
Say yes. Say yes.
- I'd love to!

94
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,666
Good night, Lisa.

95
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,438
I have a best friend.

96
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,108
You heard me say that, didn't you?
- I did.

97
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,976
We're still cool though, right?
- We are.

98
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,286
My best friend is so cool.

99
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:34,120
Mom, I'm meeting Juliet after school!
- Great!

100
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,024
Here are a few best friend tips.
Compliment her hair and shoes.

101
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,993
If her dog bites you,
don't make a big deal out of it, and...

102
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,197
Friendship is like marriage.
The key is listening.

103
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,700
Also, if her dog bites you,
don't make a big deal out of it.

104
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,035
I just said that!

105
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,135
Okay, honey.

106
00:07:50,235 --> 00:07:52,638
If it's that important
to you, you said it.

107
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,976
We're at the end of chapter four.
But we need a grabber,

108
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,812
a whammy, a snapperoo,
some eye mustard!

109
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,848
I got it! How about this?

110
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:05,184
What if Queen Helvetica
found a rare two-horned unicorn?

111
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,986
A twonicorn!

112
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,721
Oh! I love your accent.

113
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,456
'Twonicorn.'

114
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:14,126
You are definitely doing the book on tape.

115
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,432
And Queens Valedictoria and Helvetica...

116
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:23,636
...hid their beloved twonicorn
from the hungry ogre, Homeroni.

117
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:29,106
Girls are so lame.

118
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,377
Isn't that right, headless Darth Vader?

119
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,279
What's that? You miss your girlfriend,

120
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:36,249
armless Malibu Stacy wrapped
in hockey tape?

121
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,824
Now, remember.
Juliet's family is very classy.

122
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,692
So be on your best behavior.

123
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,861
Use as many big words as possible.

124
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:50,963
I call 'computer.'
Bart, you can have 'doorbell.'

125
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,571
Nice doorbell. Is it computerized?

126
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,935
Hey, that was...
- Homer!

127
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,875
Well, we... I...

128
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,444
You come up with an excuse!

129
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,881
Homer, isn't it wonderful
that my Juliet and your Lisa...

130
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,516
...have become such fast friends?

131
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,880
If you say so, m'Iord.

132
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,455
Dinner's ready.
- Lf you'll show me to your bathroom,

133
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,657
I'd like to pretend to wash my hands.

134
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,732
New friendship, so full of promise.

135
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:24,897
Much like a young Mitch McDeere
in John Grisham's The Firm.

136
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,699
When they make a movie from his books,

137
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,402
does he get one or two free tickets?

138
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,871
It depends on the production company.

139
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,373
'He had much to be happy about.

140
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:38,010
'A brilliant mind and a solid body
that did not gain weight...

141
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,679
'and needed little sleep.'

142
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,882
Attention, everyone.
Lisa and I would like to perform...

143
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:46,953
...a medley of Josh Groban's
12 most popular downloads.

144
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:51,023
Juliet, I'm worried this Josh Groban
is becoming a bit of an obsession for you.

145
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,659
Let's just listen
to James Horner's soundtrack...

146
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,649
...to The Pelican Brief, shall we?

147
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,665
Track three, Researching the Brief.

148
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,029

149
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:08,207
I hate track three! I hate it! I hate it!

150
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,178
I'll go get her.

151
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,885
Hey, could you take a look
at a lump on my back?

152
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:23,888
I'm not that kind of doctor.
- I get it. Here's 10 bucks.

153
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,257
DR. HOBBES: Mmm.

154
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,970
That's chewing gum.
- What a racket.

155
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,825
Juliet, are you okay?

156
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,767
I am now. Don't you see them?

157
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,737
See who?
- Our friends!

158
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,378
The lords and ladies of Equalia!

159
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,048
Juliet, you're scaring me just a little...

160
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:03,696
Oh!

161
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:08,568
Co-Queens Helvetica and Valedictoria,
we're so glad you're finally here.

162
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:13,428
I'm a giraffopus.
I'm uncomfortable in water and on land.

163
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,569
A twonicorn!

164
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,679
Toss me a treat!

165
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,054
I didn't know I could do that.

166
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,639
And now hit 'shuffle' on the royal MyPod.

167
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,528
...

168
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:38,688
...So she dances

169
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:44,964
In and out of the crowd like a glance

170
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:51,269
This romance is

171
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:58,283
From afar calling me silently

172
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:07,493
These be mini-pizzas made
from dragon eggs, Your Majesties.

173
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:11,297
Mom, please don't do that.
- Who is this mom of which you speak?

174
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,166
Mom, stop! This is our thing, not yours.

175
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:17,236
I'm just trying to...
- It's better if you don't.

176
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,908
Mr. And Mrs. Simpson,
we need to talk about Lisa.

177
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:26,479
She's unfocused, scribbling nonsense,
living in a world of her own.

178
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,217
Well, that's Bart for you.
- We're talking about Lisa, your daughter.

179
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:35,054
Seems like you and I are always
talking about Bart, my son.

180
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,891
Lisa has been seeing an awful lot
of her new friend.

181
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,794
Yes. The one I've seen
on Lisa's Facebook page.

182
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:45,798
I search all the children's Facebook pages
for unflattering references to me.

183
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:49,035
By the way, I enjoyed the
photos of your trip to Yosemite.

184
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:53,673
That. We were actually
just going out for brunch and I got lost.

185
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:58,310
But don't worry, Officer.
We'll definitely have a talk with the boy.

186
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,646
LISA: I can't see Juliet anymore?

187
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,982
I thought you wanted me
to have a best friend!

188
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:06,552
There are limits to how much
two people should be together!

189
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,889
Well, you can't keep Juliet and me apart!
I'II...

190
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:13,359
I'll disobey!
- I'm Bart Simpson's mother.

191
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,369
You think you've got any tricks
I haven't seen?

192
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,240
Bart Simpson, age three.

193
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,112
Bart Simpson, age ten.

194
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,927
Juliet, what are you doing here?

195
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,596
I'm running away.
And you're coming with me.

196
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:51,831
I'd love to!

197
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,767
But I'm supposed to attend
the model UN this weekend.

198
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:58,070
I'm the delegate from Azerbaijan,
and I'm threatening a rice tariff.

199
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,207
Lisa, I know how important
the model UN's work is.

200
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:05,175
But Equalia needs you. I need you.

201
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,947
Okay, best friend.

202
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:16,805
I remember when I was young
and I ran off to a land of equality.

203
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,931
Name.
- Dr. William McDougal.

204
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,943
From now on,
you're Groundskeeper Willie. Next.

205
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,523
This is where we'll live.

206
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,793
How did you find this place?
- My family ate here last week.

207
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,194
It really went downhill fast.

208
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:59,390
But if you just believe,
anyplace can be Equalia.

209
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,695
Oh, no. Clam-Elot's is closed.

210
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,984
I'm not surprised.
Their clam chowder smelled like soap.

211
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,084
Yeah.

212
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:25,558
I wonder if Lisa has threatened
the model UN with her rice tariff yet?

213
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:29,061
I doubt it. Friday's usually
just committee assignments...

214
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,796
...and procedural rules.

215
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,901
MARTIN ON PHONE: Mrs. Simpson!
- Hiya, Martin. How's the model UN?

216
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:40,139
Total chaos! We're two minutes away
from a roll call vote on a non-binding...

217
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,959
...resolution and no Azerbaijan!

218
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,645
Are you saying Lisa's not there?

219
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:50,416
To the extent you can trust
the word of a Belgian, yes!

220
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,661
Lisa ran away! And it's all my fault!

221
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:57,323
If I'd just let her continue
her obsessive relationship...

222
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:01,327
...with that troubled little girl,
everything would've been fine.

223
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,929
If I know my sister,
and unfortunately I do,

224
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:07,099
she probably ran off to
some lame-o make-believe castle.

225
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,167
A castle?

226
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,267
I know where they are!

227
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,905
Wait!
- Hmm?

228
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,774
Is it someplace I'd have to put on a tie?
- No.

229
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,577
Is it a place
I'd look overdressed if I did wear a tie?

230
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:19,745
You probably would.

231
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,881
What about a jacket
and jeans with a nice t-shirt?

232
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,082
Just go!

233
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,526
You know what I think killed this place?

234
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,363
No one wanted to drive to the
middle of the forest for clams.

235
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,380
Let's go get my little girl.

236
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,804
My family's here!

237
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:49,975
MARGE: Hmm?

238
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,075
She's not here?

239
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:55,614
KEARNEY: Hmm?

240
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,517
Girls in our hideout?

241
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:02,288
Now they'll tell people where
we go to stash our stolen peaches!

242
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,423
And to wait out our bad haircuts.

243
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,563
We'd better tie them up.

244
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,163
This place is where we came
after my bar mitzvah.

245
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,098
You said you weren't having one.

246
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,198
It was just family.

247
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:22,741
All these pictures of seafood
are making me hungry.

248
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,277
We'll get some cream for the peaches
while you guard the prisoners.

249
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,646
Don't screw it up, butt brain!

250
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,716
At least my dad didn't smoke
after his stroke.

251
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,286
Juliet, I'm scared.

252
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,922
Shut your eyes and you'll be in Equalia.

253
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,022
Equalia is not real!

254
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:42,269
Maybe not. But it's better than this.

255
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,200
So the armies of the gnomes
and the elves faced off...

256
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,603
...on either side of the hollow,
broad axes poised.

257
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,906
With a fearsome cry, they raced towards...

258
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:58,143
...the center of the battlefield,
banners aflutter in the breeze!

259
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,243
What comes next?

260
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,985
A battle to determine the fate of Equalia.
But you wouldn't be interested.

261
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,822
I have a wide variety of interests.
Is there them dragon things?

262
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,302
Isn't that a little clichéd?

263
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,061
Yes! I mean, yes,
there are dragons, everywhere!

264
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:20,029
Green ones, Chinese ones,
chubby bald ones.

265
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:23,447
I like those ones! Tell me about those!

266
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,307
'And so the queens...'
- And the Me Dragon.

267
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:32,311
'...danced the minuet of
equality on a gossamer dewdrop.'

268
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,411
Aww.

269
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:37,750
What's going on here?

270
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,284
What's this?

271
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,287
An ambitious first novel
by the two brightest young writers...

272
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,490
...this side of the
Iowa Writers' Workshop.

273
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,715
I bet it'll burn up good.

274
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,459
Put the book down!

275
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,095
Why should we, butt brain?

276
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,742
For Equalia!

277
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:04,943
...

278
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:08,342
...I am not a hero

279
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:12,645
I am not an angel

280
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:16,983
I am just a man

281
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:20,115
Man who's trying to love her

282
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,363
Well, it looks like we're safe.
- Looks like.

283
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:28,000
Juliet, I don't want to go
to Equalia anymore.

284
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,234
What do you mean?

285
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,805
It's a special place.
But I need to live in the real world.

286
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,905
The real world?

287
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,844
The real world is for people
who can't imagine anything better.

288
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,944
Goodbye, Lisa.

289
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,947
Goodbye, Juliet.

290
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,217
Cuckoo.

291
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:52,624
'We have received your manuscript,
The Chronicles of Equalia.''

292
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,817
Sounds promising so far!

293
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:59,131
'Unfortunately, it is not what
we're looking for at this time.

294
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,799
'Thank you for thinking of us.'

295
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,367
Rejected!

296
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:07,039
You got a letter all the way
from New York City,

297
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,874
and that's something.

298
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,676
And you know what else, sweetie?

299
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,112
You and your friend, Princess Nut Job,

300
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,747
inspired me to write my
own fantasy novel...

301
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,907
...based on my experiences as a dad.

302
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,057
Okay, 'Chapter One...'

303
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,591
Uh... Uh...

304
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,028
Oh!

305
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,128
Writing is hard!

306
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:37,751
BART: Ladies and gentlemen, Fall Out Boy!
