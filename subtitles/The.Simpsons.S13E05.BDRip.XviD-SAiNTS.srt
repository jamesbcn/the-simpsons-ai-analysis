1
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:06,464
The Simpsons

2
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,524
D'oh!

3
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,501
Putting away groceries,

4
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,212
it's like
unwrapping presents
from yourself.

5
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:31,632
Fruit Roll-Ups for Bart.
Beer Roll-Ups for Homer.

6
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:36,179
Burly? I bought
the wrong brand, Maggie.

7
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:39,640
I'll just
take them right back
to the store and...

8
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:40,767
Whoa!

9
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:46,272
Look at those
massive plaid
shoulders!

10
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:51,986
Look at that absorbativity!
I've gotta tell someone.

11
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,658
I came home
as quick as I could.
What's going on?

12
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,912
Watch what happens
when I spill
this blue liquid.

13
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,042
You pulled me
out of school
for this?

14
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,586
Absolutely. You're
about to get a lesson

15
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,171
in value.

16
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,719
And Burly's still
got soaking power.
Spill something else.

17
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:17,845
Mom, I believe you.

18
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,722
Spill it.

19
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,559
Hmm?

20
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,770
Ooh, Burly,
you're insatiable.

21
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:34,320
Oh, Burly,
you're so rugged
and manly.

22
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,447
Marge, a bee almost
stung me today.

23
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,866
I felt the wind go
right by my ear.

24
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:43,538
Oh, it's okay, Homie.
The bee's all gone.

25
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,498
Mmm!

26
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,336
Fantasize, Marge.
Fantasize about Burly.

27
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,010
Hey, you're looking
at that spokes-jack.
Well, I can fantasize, too.

28
00:02:58,762 --> 00:02:59,846
Hmm.

29
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,181
Ooh! Mama Celeste.

30
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,726
You touch me
and I cut you.

31
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:12,859
Homer, I'll tell you
what I told Redford.
It ain't gonna happen.

32
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,948
"Dear Burly, comma,
I've never written to
a registered trademark before.

33
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,827
"Are you a real person
or just a composite?
Question Mark.

34
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,538
"In either case,
I would love
a signed photo.

35
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,832
"Sincerely, Marge Simpson. "

36
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,802
"Love"?
"Signed photo"?

37
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,222
Marge hasn't asked me
for a signed photo
in months.

38
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:45,182
Well, I'll show her.

39
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,771
Hello?

40
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,941
We have
a person-to-person call
for Marge Simpson.

41
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,735
Person-to-person!

42
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,945
Hello.
This is Chad Sexington,

43
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,156
the model for
Burly Paper Towels.

44
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,117
How did you
get my number?

45
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:07,121
I don't know.
But I was quite moved
by your letter.

46
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,333
I'd love to meet
you and your family.
Shall we say dinner?

47
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,376
Oh, my goodness...

48
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,462
Perfect.
I'll be there at 7:00.

49
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,341
Oh, my God!
Dinner with Burly!

50
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,765
Playing a prankeroo, eh?

51
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,310
I was having
a private conversation
with my wife

52
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,980
in the guise of
Chad Sexington.
Do you mind?

53
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,615
So, how was your day?
Did anything
unbelievable happen?

54
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,617
Phone calls?
Things of that nature?

55
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,993
You're not
gonna believe it.

56
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:50,331
That paper towel lumberjack
is coming here
for dinner tonight.

57
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:54,377
Tonight?
Well, you better
get your hopes up.

58
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,836
I will.

59
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,138
That's him!

60
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,348
Oh, my God!

61
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,482
Why, look.
It's Chad Sexington!

62
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,276
Hey, baby!
I'm that guy you like.

63
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,822
Barney? Where's Chad? I...

64
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,538
Congratulations.
I feel ridiculous.

65
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,586
You mean I was just a prop
in some cruel joke?

66
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:43,050
Now you've done it.
You've really humiliated Mom.

67
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:46,137
It was hard on me, too.
I had to wear a suit.

68
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,388
Oh...

69
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,349
You're right. I've gotta
make it up to her.

70
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,518
I suggest
dinner and a show.

71
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,938
How about Benihana,
where dinner is the show?

72
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,566
No, huh?

73
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,112
Walking to hell
and back again

74
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,823
I guess it was
a pretty funny prank.

75
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,284
I like the ones
where nothing
catches on fire.

76
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:12,079
Yeah. Nothing is
hurt except feelings.

77
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:18,002
Walking to hell
and back again

78
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:24,717
Okay. You've seen
our next performer
on Mike Douglas, Merv Griffin

79
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,344
and Art Linkletter's
House Party.

80
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:31,432
Please welcome Mesmerino,
the hip hypnotist.

81
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:36,020
Thank you.
Thank you very, very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

82
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,689
Let's see.
Who do we have here?

83
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,274
Well, what's the matter
with you, champ?

84
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,609
You couldn't find a date?

85
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,904
I didn't come here
to be heckled and
spoofed and whatnot.

86
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,864
Why did you come here?
Seriously though.

87
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,033
When I snap my fingers,
my friend,

88
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,578
you will be
a make-out artist.

89
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,498
Glayvin! That's a powerful...

90
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,916
Whoa!

91
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,418
Hold it
'cause it's different!

92
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,715
Hey, cupcake, listen good.

93
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,300
I want you
to swallow that gum

94
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:10,930
and meet me in the coatroom,
in five,
four, three, two, now.

95
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,432
Whatever you say, Professor.

96
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,184
And back you go.

97
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,477
Ooh! Hey!

98
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,271
No, no, don't make me!
I don't want to go
back to the nothing!

99
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,356
I don't...

100
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,111
Oh, dear.
I've redorkulated.

101
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,240
Hey, smart move, Four-Eyes.

102
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:33,035
Sitting next to Skeletor here
makes you look like Hercules.

103
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,582
Zing.

104
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,750
What's a "Skeletor"?

105
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,418
No, no, I kid.
But seriously,

106
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,796
it's very nice
to see a young man
take his father out

107
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,214
for a night of hypnotism

108
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,632
before he dies.

109
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,345
Actually, my father
died a long time ago.

110
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,433
Okay. Is anyone here
not a downer? Anyone?

111
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,060
Do me! Do me!

112
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,650
I am in your power.
Boss me around.

113
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,863
When I snap my fingers,
you will transform into

114
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,574
a famous historian.

115
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,452
Look at me!
I'm a famous historian!
Out of my way!

116
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,458
Thank you.
Now you are
Emily Dickinson.

117
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,421
Look at me!
I'm Angie Dickinson!
Out of my way!

118
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:30,009
Now you are a young boy,

119
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:33,304
uh, yourself
at 12 years old.

120
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,017
I'm 12 years old.
I'm with my friends.

121
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:41,854
It's a beautiful summer day
at the old swimming hole.

122
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,522
Oh, my God!

123
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,861
Do something, Mesmerino.

124
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,738
Uh, yes. Yes.

125
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,699
That's better.

126
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,416
Dad, what's wrong?

127
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,293
We better
get him home.

128
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,256
There you go.

129
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,485
Hmm!

130
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,655
And Bart is set for the week.

131
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,536
Oh, no.

132
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,123
Sorry, Mrs. S.
He was kind of
disrupting things at work.

133
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,502
Yeah. He ruined
naptime and quiet time.

134
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,171
Oh, Homie,
you poor thing.

135
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,510
Oh, cool.
He's still mental.

136
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,138
Yeah. My hunch is
he's struggling with some
sort of repressed memory.

137
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,849
Hmm. How do we
unrepress it?

138
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:04,937
Well, the Yaqui Indians
brew a special tea
that unlocks memories.

139
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,023
It would be a good excuse
to use my Yaqui tea set.

140
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,862
Well, is anything
coming back to you?

141
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,197
Oh.

142
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,034
There have been so many
classic Simpson moments.

143
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:23,038
I remember that time
I tried to jump
over Springfield Gorge.

144
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,291
I'm gonna make it!

145
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,209
No, Dad. Everyone's
sick of that memory.

146
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,962
Try to remember
back when you were 12.

147
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,464
Something frightening
must have happened.

148
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,258
Hmm. Twelve.

149
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,136
Well, I remember
I used to go hiking a lot

150
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,013
with these two guys.

151
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,432
It was one of
those lazy summer days

152
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,142
you thought
would last forever.

153
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,394
And to kill the boredom,
we sang.

154
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:57,781
Mister Sandman,
bring me a dream

155
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,910
Make him the cutest
that I've ever seen

156
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,917
Check it out, Fat Tony.
Those jokers think
they're The Cowsills.

157
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:14,131
And lots of wavy hair
like Liberace

158
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,094
You guys have blundered
into our secret tobaccy patch.

159
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,847
Wow! Is that
wacky tobaccy?

160
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,349
The wackiest.

161
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,975
Let's punch
and kick them!

162
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,688
Not so fast.

163
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:32,524
He's got a Daisy.

164
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:33,650
We better scram.

165
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,028
Eighteen more pumps,
that could break the skin.

166
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,364
Hey, thanks, Moe.

167
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,867
And that's how
a troubled young Moe
saved the day.

168
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,869
Moe, what are you
doing here?
What am I...

169
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,247
My bar is empty is what.
Why ain't you guys there?

170
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,542
We're trying to
uncover a hidden trauma
in my dad's childhood.

171
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,628
What? You mean
that time he wigged out?

172
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,963
Well, give me
some of that Indian
memory tea there

173
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,924
and I'll tell you
all about it.

174
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,845
Mmm! That's good Yaqui.

175
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,933
Okay.
That night we camped out
under the stars.

176
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:13,941
Look at all them stars.
Bunch of lazy lights,
don't do nothing for nobody.

177
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,776
Hey, you know what
I'm looking forward to?

178
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,904
The future.
Have you heard about
this Internet thing?

179
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,239
Internet?

180
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:24,034
Yeah. It's the inner
netting they invented
to line swim trunks.

181
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,495
It provides
a comforting snugness.

182
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,499
Hey, what was that?

183
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,918
That's that
nuclear plant
they just opened.

184
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,170
Yeah, that's your future,
busting atoms.

185
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,424
Can you imagine
us working there?
The whole Carl Crew?

186
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,884
Hey, I thought
we were called
Lenny and the Jets.

187
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,177
Hey, you're both wrong.

188
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,431
We're the
Moe Szyslak Experience,
featuring Homer.

189
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,141
I like the sound of that.

190
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,267
Friends forever?

191
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,310
Friends forever.

192
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,437
Ow!

193
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,646
Ow! That hurts!
Man, we're stupid.

194
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,981
I hate you guys.

195
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:57,776
The next morning
we went out to the old quarry
to have a swim.

196
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:01,447
You guys really
gonna dive off of here?

197
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,158
Not me. I'm shaking
like a French soldier.

198
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,952
Yeah. I think I just
logged on to my Internet.

199
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,495
Only a moron would
jump into that...

200
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,038
Geronimo!

201
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,208
Oh, my God!

202
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,884
And there's
your whatchamacall
repressed trauma.

203
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,094
I mean,
who likes getting muddy?
It's terrible.

204
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,804
Okay.
Let's go to Moe's now.

205
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:29,224
Wait a minute.
I remember falling
in the mud.

206
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,227
But I don't think
that's why
I've been screaming.

207
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,313
Fine.
Crap all over my theory.

208
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,399
Something else
happened in that quarry.

209
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,234
Something else.

210
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,696
Hey, what happened
to all the water?

211
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,324
Hmm.

212
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,576
Hey, there's
something blocking it.

213
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:49,661
Hey, come on.

214
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:54,666
Come on, Homer!
We're going to Sears
to feel the bras!

215
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,252
What the heck is that thing?

216
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,527
You found a corpse
when you were 12?

217
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,155
No wonder you've
been so traumatized.

218
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:32,079
It's responsible
for everything
wrong in my life.

219
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:36,959
My occasional overeating,
my fear of corpses.

220
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,756
What I want to know is
what the heck was
that body doing there?

221
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,008
Maybe there's murder afoot.

222
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,468
Murder most foul?

223
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,594
Maybe.

224
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,805
You know,
if Dad never told anyone,

225
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,558
that body must
still be out there.

226
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:56,937
This sounds like a case
that only the Simpson family
can solve.

227
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,146
Oh.

228
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,525
Okay. Uh, well,
we'll just be going then.

229
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,236
Hey, you guys can
come with us.

230
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,280
No, no, no.
He said "Simpson family. "

231
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,823
I mean, you know,
it sounded exciting.

232
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,200
But, you know,
we don't want to intrude.

233
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,868
Thanks for understanding.

234
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,036
Oh.

235
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,622
Oh, okay. Well...

236
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,041
I'll see ya.

237
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,553
Bye, Moe.

238
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:37,978
Yep. The old quarry
is just a stone's throw away.

239
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,605
Stop saying that, Dad.

240
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,772
Never.

241
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,026
Hey, there's Mesmerino.

242
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,072
Seventeen seventy-six.

243
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,785
"How much is left
in my checking account. "

244
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:01,293
This is it.
This is the old quarry.

245
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,630
Maybe we should come back
in the daytime.

246
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,174
Someone's yellow
belly is showing.

247
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,342
Oh, sorry.

248
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:12,971
Ah, geez.
Right in the eyes.

249
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,139
Chief Wiggum!

250
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,099
Who's there? How do you...
How do you know my name?

251
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,976
It's us, the Simpsons.

252
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,311
Oh.

253
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,772
I saw your car
by the gate and I...

254
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:24,232
Well, I thought
you might be lost hikers.

255
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,110
'Cause then
I could rescue you,
and be a hero.

256
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,612
And maybe
the city would give me

257
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,198
a coupon for
free guitar lessons.

258
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,742
So what are you doing here?

259
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,453
We're investigating
a possible murder case.

260
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:40,165
Oh. You mind if I tag along?
I'm kind of a crime buff.

261
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,420
If there's a body in here,
we'll drag it up.

262
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,219
Heck. It's just
an old shopping cart.

263
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,637
Oh, and it's empty.

264
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,598
Put it back.
I don't want to
see it this way.

265
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,435
We'll never find the body
under all this water.

266
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,978
Water, eh?

267
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,481
Burly to the rescue!

268
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,320
Oh, that is so cool.

269
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,743
Hey! What's that over there?

270
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,081
Don't get excited.

271
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,501
It's just a skull-shaped rock
and a bunch of white sticks.

272
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,086
It's the body.

273
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,380
And someone has
eaten the flesh.

274
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,466
But whose body is it?

275
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,510
And who sent it
down that pipe?

276
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,601
Now do you believe
dead rats float, Lisa?

277
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:42,686
Yes.

278
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,233
Well, looks like
the end of the line.

279
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:53,739
That means our murderer
could be on
the other side of this hatch.

280
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,425
What are you doing
in my corpse hatch?

281
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,762
Montgomery Burns,
you're under
arrest for murder.

282
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:20,849
Did I say corpse hatch?
I meant "innocence tube. "

283
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,310
Then how do you
explain this?

284
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,064
I've been expecting
this day for 30 years.

285
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,400
In a way, it's a relief.

286
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,486
But in another way,
it's most unwelcome.

287
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,238
All right,
quit stalling, Burns.
Who'd you ice?

288
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,492
I'm afraid that skull
belongs to my dear friend,

289
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,911
Waylon Smithers Senior.

290
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:44,080
Mr. Smithers' father!

291
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,208
But I did not murder him.

292
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,587
And I can prove it

293
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,464
with this film.

294
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,383
Ooh! A movie!
I call the couch!

295
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,222
If you see only
one film this year that
proves my innocence,

296
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,681
make it this one.

297
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,520
Why are these
numbers so high?

298
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,188
Why is that
red light flashing?

299
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,773
And what's that
alarming sound?

300
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,400
Smithers, get in here!
Smithers!

301
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,695
Sorry, Monty.
I was feeding Waylon Junior.

302
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,697
Will you put
that baby down?

303
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,867
There's something wrong
with the reactor core.

304
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:26,122
I better go in
and have a look.

305
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,541
No, Waylon Senior.

306
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,459
It could be filled
with atoms, and steam,

307
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,169
and other
nuclear bric-a-brac.

308
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:34,089
If this reactor blows,
the whole town is doomed,

309
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,841
including my son.

310
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,974
So, you're a baby, huh?
How's that
working out for you?

311
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,810
He did it!

312
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,020
Look at your
heroic daddy in there

313
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,023
making funny faces,
falling to the floor,

314
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:55,652
shedding his hair,
lying perfectly still...

315
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,321
Oh, dear.

316
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,781
Sir.

317
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:08,248
Smithers Senior gave his life
to save the plant.

318
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,375
And since cover-ups
were all the rage back then,

319
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,086
I shoved his heroic corpse
down the sewer pipe.

320
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,964
I never told Smithers
the truth about his father.

321
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,966
Until tonight, sir.

322
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,969
Smithers Junior.

323
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,470
Ha! Busted.

324
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,891
Now the movie's
turned into a play.
Still good though.

325
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,726
I'm sorry
I lied to you, Waylon.

326
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,770
But I wanted to spare you
the details of your
father's gruesome death.

327
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:34,983
Well, I'm glad to know
he died a hero
instead of that other way.

328
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:39,905
I told him his father
was killed in the Amazon
by a tribe of savage women.

329
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,740
I hope it didn't
affect you in any way.

330
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,325
We'll never know, sir.

331
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,165
Well, Marge, we solved
the case of
the haunted quarry.

332
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,586
Homer, shouldn't we
give that skull
to Mr. Smithers?

333
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,421
Why? He'd just bury it.

334
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:00,759
Hey! Hey! I found a clue
that's gonna bust
your mystery wide open.

335
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,802
Sorry.
We already solved it.

336
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:03,887
Oh.

337
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:08,266
Well, you want
to take a look at it
anyways just for ha-ha's?

338
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:09,935
Seems kind of pointless now.

339
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,519
Yeah, I guess you're right.

340
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,438
It's just that, you know,
I went to a lot of trouble,

341
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,274
you know,
making the envelope
and everything.

342
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,610
Let's see
what you have, Moe.

343
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,778
Okay.

344
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,155
Now this first thing
is just gonna look
like a used Band-Aid,

345
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,281
and it is.

346
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,992
But the rest of the stuff
don't make no sense
without it.

347
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,619
So, you know,
bear with me.

348
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:31,581
Wow, Moe.
You've been doing
a lot of sleuthing.

349
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:35,168
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
I sleuthed my ass off
on this one.

350
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,296
Okay, this is a number six
from somebody's address.

351
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:41,591
Or is it a nine?
You don't know.

352
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:45,261
This is gravel.
Okay? Gravel.

353
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:45,971
This is...
That's more gravel.
Okay. Oh!

354
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,765
This is...
That's more gravel.
Okay. Oh!

355
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:53,853
This is a shell that, to me,
this is just me talking.

356
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,855
It looks like
a helmet for a mouse.

357
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,650
Now, that sounds crazy, right?

358
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:02,946
But if you ask
the mice about it,
they don't say nothing.

359
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,990
I mean,
they run the other way.

360
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,659
At first, I was just fishing
with the helmet thing.

361
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,745
But then from
the mouse reaction I got,

362
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,165
I got a little
more concerned.

363
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,752
You really made
that envelope?

364
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,088
'Cause it says
"Hammermill" over here.

365
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,800
Um... No.

366
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:34,269
