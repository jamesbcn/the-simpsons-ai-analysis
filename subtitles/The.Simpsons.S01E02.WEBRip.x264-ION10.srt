You look very intelligent, dear.

175
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,883
No way!

176
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,671
How about a tie, son?

177
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,277
Everybody knows
boy geniuses wear ties.

178
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,511
You're stifling
my creativity, Dad.

179
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,885
- Sorry, boy.
- Bart, this is a big day for you.

180
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,222
Why don't you eat something
a little more nutritious?

181
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,638
Nonsense, Marge.

182
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,556
Frosty Krusty Flakes are what
got him where he is today.

183
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,685
It could be one
of these chemicals here

184
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,112
that makes him so smart.

185
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,110
Lisa, maybe you should
try some of this.

186
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,323
Homer!

187
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,743
I'm just saying why not have
two geniuses in the family?

188
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,452
Sort of a spare, in case
Bart's brain blows up.

189
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,493
I don't care what that
stupid test says, Bart.

190
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,747
You're a dimwit.

191
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,408
Maybe so, but from now on,

192
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,246
this dimwit is on easy street.

193
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,838
No rush, Dad.
Take the scenic route.

194
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,128
Gotcha.

195
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,885
No. Ties.

196
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,972
Don't worry, son.
You can have mine.

197
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,598
Here. Let me show you
how to put on a tie.

198
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,435
The hook goes over the top
and these things go in there.

199
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,771
Thanks, Dad.

200
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,864
You kissed me.

201
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,364
There's nothing wrong

202
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,276
with a father kissing
his son... I think.

203
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,906
Now go on, boy,
and pay attention.

204
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,243
Because if you do,

205
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,788
one day you may
achieve something

206
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,961
that we Simpsons have dreamed about
for generations.

207
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,291
You may outsmart someone.

208
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,723
You must be Bart Simpson.

209
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,219
I'm Ms. Melon,
your learning coordinator.

210
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,352
Let me say right at the start that
we have one rule here:

211
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,350
Make your own rules.

212
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,982
If you feel sleepy, take a nap.

213
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,140
If you get bored,

214
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,268
feel free to take out
a book and start reading.

215
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,895
- What should I read, ma'am?
- Anything you want, Bart.

216
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,606
A comic book?

217
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,908
How did this get mixed in here?

218
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,491
We used it last week

219
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,446
as a prop in a film
we made about illiteracy.

220
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,678
Bart, these are the students who will
share your work area.

221
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,627
This is Ethan Foley.

222
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,249
O Memsahib, Bart.
Rabbi has memo.

223
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,917
What?

224
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,585
Ethan's very good
with palindromes.

225
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,224
You know, sentences
spelled the same

226
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,640
backwards and forwards.

227
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,639
And this is Sidney Swift.

228
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,681
- Trabing norm doog.
- What's your problem?

229
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,635
Don't mind Sidney.

230
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,306
He's just speaking
in backwards phonetics today.

231
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,355
He said,
"Good morning, Bart."

232
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,279
- And this is Cecile Shapiro.
- Hi, Bart.

233
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,568
Cool hamsters.
What are their names?

234
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,202
Hamster Number One
has been infected

235
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,609
with a staphylococci virus.

236
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,987
Hamster Number Two
is the control hamster.

237
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,994
Hi, little control hamster.

238
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,696
I wouldn't get too attached, Bart.

239
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,786
We're dissecting him next week.

240
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,752
Discover your desks, people.

241
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,212
Now let's all welcome
the newest member

242
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,003
of our collective experience,
Bart Simpson.

243
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,297
And now we can continue
our debate from yesterday.

244
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,643
When we left off,
Calvin and Tanya were arguing

245
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,639
that free will is an illusion.

246
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,521
If you ask me,
humankind has freedom,

247
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,349
a freedom fraught
with paradoxes.

248
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,645
Freud shows how childhood shapes
our subconscious mind,

249
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,859
but this helps us
to think for ourselves.

250
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,859
Very good, Ian.

251
00:12:55,941 --> 00:13:00,321
Does anyone else
have an example of a paradox?

252
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,534
Without law and order,
man has no freedom.

253
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,366
If you want peace,
you must prepare for war.

254
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,504
Well, it seems
the smartest child in the class

255
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,501
is also the quietest.

256
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,793
Bart, what other paradoxes
affect our lives?

257
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,336
Well, you're damned if you do,

258
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,545
and you're damned if you don't.

259
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,966
Well, I guess that
would be a paradox too.

260
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,056
Thank you, Bart.

261
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,437
Tell you what, Bart.

262
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,692
I'll trade you the weight
of a bowling ball

263
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,154
on the eighth moon
of Jupiter from my lunch

264
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,645
for the weight of a feather
on the second moon of Neptune

265
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:42,777
from your lunch.

266
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,663
- Well, okay.
- There you go!

267
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,945
I'll trade you
1,000 picoliters of my milk

268
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,327
for 4 gills of yours.

269
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,583
- Well, all right.
- Anything you say.

270
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,760
Bart, would you
wager your cupcake against my...

271
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,759
Save your breath.

272
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,971
What do you think
of the new kid?

273
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,011
A rather mediocre genius.

274
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,885
Yes, not very bright at all.

275
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,444
So, how was it?

276
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,153
- Os-os.
- What?

277
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,943
- That's backwards for so-so.
- Wow.

278
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,277
What are you reading there?
Comic books?

279
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,373
Guess you don't want to overheat
the old noggin?

280
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,699
Tell you what.

281
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,664
To celebrate your first day
of genius school,

00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:34,164
what do you say we go out for a round
of frosty chocolate milkshakes?

283
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,418
All righty!

284
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,090
Bart, I feel so bad for going
so many years without...

285
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,382
What's that word where you encourage
something to grow?

286
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,639
- Nurturing.
- Nurturing your brilliant brain,

287
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,893
so I got tickets
to the opera tonight.

288

Hurry up. Get dressed.

Whoa! Yeah, strike three!
You're outta there!

349
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,348
So, what was it you
wanted to tell me, son?

350
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,732
Nothing, Pop.

351
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,902
I'm still trying to get you
a lab partner, Bart.

352
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,609
If we don't get any volunteers soon,
I'll assign somebody.

353
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,940
Say, what's that?
It looks dangerous.

354
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:34,776
Well, it's really pretty
top secret, ma'am.

355
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,993
All right, keep going.

356
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,374
But you do know what happens

357
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,950
when you mix
acids and bases, right?

358
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,995
'Course I do.

359
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,672
Sorry.

360
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:53,172
Now, Bart, we want to emphasize that
nobody's angry about this.

361
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,507
We're... We're just concerned.

362
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,722
When a young man with a 216 IQ

363
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,433
can't make
a simple experiment work,

364
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,723
well, it doesn't take
a Bart Simpson to figure out

365
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,977
that something's wrong.

366
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,888
Tell me. Is the class moving
too slowly for you?

367
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,018
Lord, no.

368
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,064
Well, then, what can
we do to make you happy?

369
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,068
I wanna go back to my old class.

370
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,150
But, Bart, don't you
remember the boredom,

371
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,445
the ennui,
the intellectual malaise?

372
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,530
Yeah, well, you know, kinda, um,

373
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,985
but I was thinking
I could go undercover.

374
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:24,746
Undercover?
Bart, I'm intrigued. Go on.

375
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,170
Well, I could pretend
I'm a regular dumb kid.

376
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,420
You know, to study them

377
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,461
and all the stuff they do
with each other.

378
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,455
You know, see what
makes them tick.

379
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,967
I see. Like Jane Goodall
and the chimps.

380
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,469
Yeah.

381
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,931
This is most impressive, Bart.

382
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,931
You write up your proposal
while I talk to Principal Skinner.

383
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,474
- Proposal?
- You know, outline your project,

384
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,518
what you hope to achieve,
what you'll require to do it.

385
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,613
Gotcha, man.

386
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:54,528
"'My proposal' by Bart Simpson.

387
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,530
"I want to pretend...

388
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,583
"I am a regular dumb kid.
Period.

389
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:05,498
By this, I hope..."

390
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:10,879
No.
"For this, I will..."

391
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:15,379
"Require..."

392
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,052
Man.

393
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:24,055
"'My Confession'
by Bart Simpson.

394
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,889
"I am a regular dumb kid.
Period.

395
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:32,056
I cheated on my intelligence test.
Period."

396
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,227
Finished already?

397
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,856
Principal Skinner will be
very interested to...

398
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:41,365
You know,

399
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,988
you misspelled
"confession."

400
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,986
Hey, lookin' good, Bart.

401
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,658
Bart, what happened?

402
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,116
I had a little accident
in chemistry today.

403
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,247
Well, I bet it's nothing
a little turpentine won't take off.

404
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,745
Come on, son.

405
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,919
Don't be discouraged, son.

406
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,926
I bet Einstein turned
himself all sorts of colors

407
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,468
before he invented
the lightbulb.

408
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,892
Dad, I gotta tell you something.

409
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,892
Hope you won't be too mad.

410
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,444
- What is it, son?
- I'm not a genius, Dad.

411
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,479
What?

412
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,822
I cheated on
the intelligence test.

413
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,778
I'm sorry.
But I just want to say

414
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,279
that the past few weeks
have been great.

415
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,492
Me and you have
done stuff together.

416
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,492
You've helped me out
with things,

417
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,914
and we're closer
than we've ever been.

418
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,004
I love you, Dad.

419
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,169
And I think if something
can bring us that close,

420
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,460
it can't possibly be bad.

421
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:39,554
Why, you little...

422
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:43,341
What's going on out there?

423
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,387
I think Bart's stupid again,
Mom.

424
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,390
Well.

425
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,644
You can't stay in there forever!

426
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,267
I can try.

427
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,483
March your butt
right out here, now!

428
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,654
- No way, man.
- But...

429
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,153
Son, if you don't come out,

430
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:04,235
I can't hug you and kiss you
and make you feel all better.

431
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,453
You think I'm dumb enough
to fall for that?

432
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,743
I'm insulted.

433
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,089
♪♪

434
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,336
Shh!
