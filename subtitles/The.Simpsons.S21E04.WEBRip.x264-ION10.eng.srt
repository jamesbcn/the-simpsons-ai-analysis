00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:33,995
Ha!

180
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,998
<i>Ay caramba, </i>you little snot.

181
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,045
I’m here at Krustyburger
for the launch

182
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,885
of the highly anticipated
"Burger Squared."

183
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,430
Krusty, what
can you tell us

184
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,723
about this fantastic
new sandwich?

185
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,847
I’m glad you
asked, Kent.

186
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,103
We start

187
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,895
with Grade A beef,
feed that to other cows,

188
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,359
then kill them
and serve the unholy results

189
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,400
on a seven-grain bun.

190
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,654
Burger Squared!

191
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,985
The math checks out!

192
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,570
Cows eating cows?!

193
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,155
That’s an abomination!

194
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,330
Now, Lisa,

195
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,868
you’re a vegetarian,

196
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,041
but these cows have made
a different choice.

197
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,870
And now, this lucky reporter
will be the first human

198
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,826
to sample this delicious crime
against nature.

199
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,088
Mmm.

200
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,589
Juicy, flavorful,

201
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,300
with just a hint of...

202
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,550
(angry zombie snarl)

203
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,755
Hey!

204
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,723
That’s my check-cashing
arm, you stupid...

205
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,313
(enraged zombie roar)

206
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,808
(screaming)

207
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,020
(roaring)

208
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,020
(people screaming)

209
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,532
{\an8}(all roaring)

210
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,610
A little tip: you might want
to wash me before you eat me.

211
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,866
-(roaring)
-Thank you.

212
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,196
The munchers got Moe!

213
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,874
Well, we’re not going
out to help him.

214
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,873
We have no idea what hideous
creatures might be out there!

215
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,706
-(pounding window)
-Please, let me in!

216
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,042
How do I know
you’re not a muncher?

217
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:07,046
I’m your father
and I need your help!

218
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,169
I can’t make sense
of that muncher talk!

219
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,257
-(ferocious snarls)
-(Grampa screaming)

220
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,052
-(munching)
-(body thuds, screaming stops)

221
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,005
(dog howling)

222
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,045
Hungry.

223
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,217
So hungry.

224
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,596
There’s nothing to eat.

225
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,813
Except this.

226
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,403
There’s gotta be something yummy
out there.

227
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,399
(electrical buzzing)

228
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,151
(roaring)

229
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,645
(gasps)

230
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,953
A hamburger!

231
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,581
(grunting)

232
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,040
(humming)

233
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,370
(munching)

234
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,044
(chomping, belching)

235
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:42,923
(gasps)

236
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,919
Bart ate
a tainted burger!

237
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,671
I’ll bash him
with this book!

238
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,552
-(grunts)
-(screams)

239
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,169
Dad!
No! That’s the last book
in the world!

240
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,257
Really?

241
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,051
Yes! It’s-- oh.

242
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,005
Go ahead.

243
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,682
Wait!

244
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,143
The burger didn’t change me!

245
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,023
I’m not a muncher!

246
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,560
Oh, my God.

247
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,193
If Bart could eat the burger
and survive,

248
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,571
then maybe he can yield the key
to an anti-muncher vaccine!

249
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,979
(gagging)

250
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,897
Then we must keep this boy
safe from harm!

251
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,817
Better call Dr. Hibbert.

252
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,945
-(grunting)
-(groaning)

253
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,083
(sighing)

254
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,369
Well, I suppose
Bart could be immune--

255
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,503
-(roaring)
-a genetic "chosen one,"
if you will.

256
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,580
(chuckles)

257
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,504
If so, secrets locked

258
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,593
within his blood could
be the key to saving humanity.

259
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,999
You must get him immediately

260
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,877
to the safe zone,
just outside of town.

261
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,934
<i>If you see my wife,</i>
<i>tell her I love her.</i>

262
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,509
You mean tell her
I love her?

263
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,604
Or I meaning you?

264
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,138
(screaming)

265
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,811
(dial tone droning)

266
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,730
Mm, I’ll just
high-five her.

267
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,808
(door creaking)

268
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:50,324
(whispering):
Now remember, no loud noises.

269
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,569
(door squeaks open)

270
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,152
Oh, man, that
breeze feels good!

271
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,107
(munchers growling,
Homer and Bart scream)

272
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,078
(whimpering)

273
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,829
To the panic room!

274
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,411
We don’t have
a panic room!

275
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,156
To the panic room store!

276
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,747
(munchers growling)

277
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,342
(muncher Grampa growling)

278
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,298
(two gunshots)

279
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,959
(à la Terminator): Come with me
if you want to live.

280
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,838
(growling)

281
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,045
Another politician
who can’t keep his promises.

282
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,256
APU:
Psst!

283
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,806
This way.

284
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,429
Well, this day can’t
get any crazier.

285
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,767
(munchers clamoring, growling)

286
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,025
(engine revving)

287
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,948
Apu, how did you survive?

288
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,622
Well, as a vegetarian,

289
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,991
I did not consume
any tainted burgers,

290
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,158
and as a convenience store
owner, I am armed to the teeth.

291
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,588
We need windows, too!

292
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,800
-(tires squealing)
-(growling)

293
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,141
-(growling)
-(glass shattering)

294
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,638
Shoot her!

295
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,510
(gun cocking)

296
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,806
I can’t shoot her.

297
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,059
She’s Lisa’s godmother.

298
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,561
You can apologize in hell!

299
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,852
I guess I could.

300
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,145
(gunshot, groans)

301
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,445
(engine revving)

302
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,120
(yelling)

303
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,698
-(crash)
-Hmm?

304
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,123
What the...?

305
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:24,951
(sighs)

306
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,445
I will get
out and push.

307
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:30,327
No matter what, Bart must
make it to the safe zone.

308
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,004
(growling)

309
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,045
(grunting)

310
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,459
(engine revving)

311
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:40,047
That was so noble of Apu
to give his life for us.

312
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,554
Where are you going?!

313
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,545
You were supposed to stop
at the bottom and wait for me!

314
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,847
(munchers growling)

315
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,268
(truck sputtering)

316
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,697
I don’t see the
safe zone anywhere.

317
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,989
Let’s play a game.

318
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,821
Who gets to carry
the chosen one?

319
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,327
Ow!

320
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:08,328
Aw, did the chosen one hurt
his chosen little noggin?

321
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,252
Ow! Ow! <i>Ow!</i>

322
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,382
Ow! Quit it. Ow!

323
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,169
-Quit it!
-(flies buzzing)

324
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,422
Well, well, well.

325
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:20,054
Who’s an unproductive
worker now?

326
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,802
Got your nose.

327
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,144
(laughs)

328
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,009
(shrieks)
Why you...

329
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,095
(grunts)

330
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,810
(growls)

331
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,642
(growling)

332
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,437
Homie, where
have you been?

333
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,482
(jabbering)

334
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,025
Dad, are you becoming a muncher?

335
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,399
I think the better brains is,
are you brains a brains?

336
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,778
(growling)

337
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,084
Where do you want it,
the mouth or the eyes?

338
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,828
-Ooh, mouth.
-Eyes it is.

339
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,200
No! When we get you
to the safe zone,

340
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,997
we can cure your father!

341
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,251
Safe zone?

342
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,792
You really think
there’s a safe zone?

343
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,205
(cackling)

344
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,213
Well, you’re right.
It’s right over there.

345
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,085
-(all clamoring)
-Let us in!

346
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,052
(shotgun blast)

347
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,341
Let us in.

348
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,264
We have the chosen one!

349
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,263
CROWD:
Oh...!

350
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,755
Welcome, son.

351
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,597
To survive, all we must
do is eat your flesh.

352
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,063
MARGE:
Hold it right there, bub.

353
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,812
What kind of civilized people
eat the body

354
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,645
and blood of their savior?

355
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,941
(uneasy murmur)

356
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,194
There must be another way.

357
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,028
Hmm...

358
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,783
(kids shouting playfully)

359
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,615
<i>LISA:</i>
<i>Time has passed.</i>

360
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,030

Ooh, in an unrelated matter,
I just put on cologne

Marge, I’ve got some
bad news to give you.

428
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,985
It’s a letter from Homer
on my stationery

429
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,786
in my handwriting,

430
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,749
using my idioms
and speech patterns.

431
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,079
And it begins, "Dear Midge:

432
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,124
you probably hate me by now,

433
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,208

what’s wrong which youse?
