1
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:04,638
They want me back?

2
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,112
No one's here today.

3
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:46,613
Even the choir's late.

4
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,349
<i>Michael,
take the carpool lane</i>

5
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,819
<i>Hallelujah</i>

6
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,956
<i>They just crossed
the double line</i>

7
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:59,493
<i>Traffic school them</i>

8
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,295
Yeah.

9
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,763
Mom, with all the room,

10
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,965
do we have to sit
so close to the geezers?

11
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:07,301
- It's too hot.
- It's too cold.

12
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,603
I'm not even alive.

13
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,072
What time
does Joan Rivers come on?

14
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,340
She doesn't.

15
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,943
This is a church,
and it's not your church.

16
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,244
New Testament?

17
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:19,646
Oy-yoi-yoi,
when did this happen?

18
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:23,250
Alexa,
play Tranquil Organ Radio.

19
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,655
Peace be with you.

20
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,223
And also with you.

21
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,392
Oh, you can do better than that.

22
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,795
We can, but we don't want to.

23
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,697
I can't hear you.

24
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,699
You clearly can.

25
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,667
Lord,
either make this interesting

26
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:43,003
or just rapture me now.

27
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:56,216
Salt the ham water, boys.

28
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,119
Clancy Wiggum
is meeting his quota.

29
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:00,821
Hey! That's illegal.

30
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,389
Oh, sorry. You know what?

31
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,124
Here. Have a quarter, Chief.

32
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,860
You think you can bribe me
with a...? Oh, my God!

33
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,196
Those are the gentlest eyes
I've ever seen.

34
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,632
Linen shirt. Natural highlights.

35
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,033
You want to hold my gun?

36
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,002
You can.

37
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,137
Thanks. I was hoping
maybe you could point me

38
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:18,538
- to the church in town.
- Church?

39
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,907
Yeah, straight down this street.
First steeple you see.

40
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,744
That is not it. That's
the Eiffel Tower strip club.

41
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,746
They have
a French onion soup that is,

42
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,347
well, it's just okay.

43
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:30,517
And I guess

44
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:31,885
that's about all.

45
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:39,459
You shall bore me no more!

46
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,627
You're going the wrong way!

47
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,896
No, I want to go this way.
I love God.

48
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:45,632
If you love him so much,
why don't you marry him?

49
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,434
Penny. Button.

50
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,403
IOU for one penny.

51
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,904
Hi. Bode Wright.

52
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,939
Recovery meetings
are downstairs.

53
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,108
Booze to the right,
huffers to the left.

54
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,577
Sorry, I'm here about the ad.
On Christslist?

55
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,579
About you guys needing
a youth pastor?

56
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,081
I didn't place any ad.

57
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,349
I placed the ad.

58
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,920
- I'm Bode.
- Bode. Nice cross.

59
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,755
Tim's are chewed to nubs.

60
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:11,391
I chew my crosses.
Nervous habit.

61
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:15,429
Do you have
any experience, Bode?

62
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,596
I used to work in Michigan.

63
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,899
Had to use bottled holy water.

64
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,300
Education?

65
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,302
I have a master's
in divinity

66
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,970
with a focus
on biblical languages.

67
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,872
- Greek, Hebrew...
- You're hired.

68
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,874
Up-bup-bup-bup-bup!
It doesn't work that fast.

69
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,378
We have I-9s and W-2s,
collar fittings.

70
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:34,081
And, besides,
I'm the one in charge.

71
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,616
In the end,
isn't God in charge here?

72
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,753
Do you see Jimmy Buffett
at every Jimmy Buffett cafÃ©?

73
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,288
I don't think so.

74
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,356
Hey, can I have this?
Marge could use it

75
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,125
to serve me snacks
while I'm on the toilet.

76
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:46,960
- Oh, just take it.
- So, Bode,

77
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,162
- do you have anywhere to stay?
- Not yet.

78
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,064
I saw a motel by the tire fire.

79
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,938
- He'll stay with us.
- No way.

80
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,774
Reverend? The homeless
are here for their foot washing.

81
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:05,112
I'm looking for a mani-pedi
and an eyebrow wax.

82
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,547
I guess I could use
a little help around here.

83
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,316
Thank you.
I won't let you down.

84
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,318
We don't hug here.

85
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,523
I'm here for the
Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

86
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,860
It's usually me, Lenny, Carl,
Bumblebee Man, Kent Brockman.

87
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,461
But don't tell anyone.

88
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:22,763
Downstairs to the right.

89
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,965
Also, Lunchlady Dora, King Toot,

90
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:28,635
and a man I'll identify
as Disco S.

91
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:32,038
Disco S is quite a mess.

92
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,046
Oh, Marge, this is embarrassing.

93
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,481
We don't need counseling.

94
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,049
We do need counseling.

95
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,851
I'm carrying a lot of anger.

96
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,887
Just do what I do. Come home

97
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,222
and have a hot dinner
waiting for you.

98
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,224
Well, let me just say

99
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,560
that I go into this
with no preconceptions.

100
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,096
Now, tell me,
how is this Homer's fault?

101
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:59,065
He sold our home
without telling me.

102
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,634
Helen, is he playing

103
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,102
with my damn trains?

104
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,438
Excuse me. There's trouble
down at Lovejoy Junction.

105
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,873
So, we're good?

106
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,276
We're good
if we get our house back.

107
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,944
Did you say houseboat?

108
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,613
House back. House back!

109
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,593
Sorry, Reverend.
I'm trying to get some rest?

110
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,261
The 12:10 to Trenton
doesn't stop

111
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,431
just because your fat head's
on the track.

112
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,504
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

113
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:38,905
- You gonna drop that?
- Not doing a thing.

114
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,774
As a gag, you're gonna drop
a tiny log on my face?

115
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,375
- Nothing.
- As I'm sleeping? That's-that's funny.

116
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,777
- Nothing. Nothing.
- Go ahead. Drop it.

117
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,078
- Drop a tiny log on me.
- Not doing a thing.

118
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,346
Is that... Is that your plan?
You're gonna drop that?

119
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,215
Look, we're both grown men here.

120
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,217
Now leave my choo choo alone.

121
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,585
Gladly.

122
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,089
Glad I finally got to use that.

123
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:57,991
Now, my sleepy, young friend,

124
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:01,161
I don't know how you did things
back in Michigan.

125
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,563
Air quotes are for when
something's not a real thing.

126
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,333
But in my parish,
we minister to our flock.

127
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,401
And I'm not afraid
to say the hard things

128
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,237
that need to be said.

129
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,671
I 27.

130
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,340
- What?
- What did he say?

131
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:16,076
We can't hear you.

132
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:19,112
B 3.

133
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,181
You know, I'd be happy
to yell out numbers for you.

134
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,349
Help save your voice.

135
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:25,018
Bingo requires
a firm, experienced caller.

136
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,920
G. G 48.

137
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,456
N 4... N 43.

138
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:30,924
I got nothing.

139
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,594
I think I can handle it.

140
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,129
When I was in seminary school,

141
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,931
I was the shouty guy
on our rowing team.

142
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:40,400
We weren't allowed
to say coxswain.

143
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:43,169
Bingo is not for newbies.

144
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,139
The letters sound very similar.

145
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,407
B 15.

146
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:50,310
B as in Balthazar.

147
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:52,078
Did he say Galthazar?

148
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,680
Gingo!

149
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,982
Gingo take you to bathroom.

150
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,918
I don't want to go.

151
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:01,721
Hey, this no picnic
for Gingo either.

152
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,223
Empty again.

153
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,492
And those two
just came here to make out.

154
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:13,233
If we do it in a church,
I, like, can't get pregnant.

155
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,470
Good mor...

156
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:18,738
Excuse me.

157
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,580
Brothers and sisters,

158
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:32,085
Reverend Lovejoy is experiencing
some vocal difficulties.

159
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,889
Save your voice, Reverend.

160
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,325
Now, we could cancel church.

161
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:46,299
But God clearly foresaw this

162
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,335
and sent us a backup pastor

163
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,669
to finish the service.

164
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,540
Church will not be canceled.

165
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,178
Now please help me welcome

166
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,414
our new youth minister
Bode Wright.

167
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,585
Thanks. That's very meek.
Jesus would've loved it.

168
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,454
I was thinking, while
the reverend rests his voice,

169
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,389
maybe we could all sing a song.

170
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:11,291
Rev, if that's okay
with you, cough once.

171
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,294
We did not establish
what two coughs means,

172
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,196
so I'll take that
to mean two yeses.

173
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,132
Why don't we sing, I don't know,

174
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,700
Amazing Grace?
You all know that one.

175
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,469
Or if you don't,
it's in your hymnal under

176
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:25,305
grace, comma, amazing.

177
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,580
<i>Amazing grace,
how sweet the sound</i>

178
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:37,584
<i>That saved a wretch like me</i>

179
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,487
<i>I once was lost
but now I'm found</i>

180
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:44,090
<i>'Twas blind, but now I see</i>

181
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,526
This is the most exciting thing
that ever happened

182
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,461
in a white church!

183
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,463
All these years
of mediocre grace.

184
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,033
Finally, it's amazing.

185
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,201
This must've been
what it was like

186
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,103
at Jesus's concerts.

187
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,642
Thank you. Now we'd...

188
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,577
we'd like to do
a couple of new psalms.

189
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:10,517
<i>Hallelujah, hallelu</i>

190
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,353
<i>Hallelujah, hallelu</i>

191
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,487
<i>Hallelujah</i>

192
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,591
Something exciting's

193
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,126
happening at the church.

194
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,195
Let's check it out.

195
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,933
All right, I think we get it.
Grace, it's amazing.

196
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,302
I know most of you
usually save your hallelujahs

197
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:30,537
for when church is over.

198
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,373
I adore the informality.

199
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,375
But if it's okay, I thought
maybe I could just speak

200
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:36,543
to you guys
straight from my heart.

201
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:37,944
I don't have anything planned,

202
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,446
but I guess I should talk
about God, right?

203
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,713
Church. Pastor.

204
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,549
Makes sense
I should talk about God.

205
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,317
But the truth is,
I woke up this morning

206
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,119
and I wasn't really sure
if I believed in God.

207
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,555
No God?

208
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:49,923
Fingers in your ears, boys.

209
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,791
Till you can feel the brain.

210
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,026
It's okay. Everything's fine.

211
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,427
I just woke up
with some doubt.

212
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:56,362
Like many of you did too,
I'm sure.

213
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,031
There's so much pain
and suffering in the world,

214
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,133
I wasn't sure anyone
was really out there.

215
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,868
Watching us. On a cloud.

216
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,103
That's how we think of God,
right?

217
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,371
To many of us,
God is just an angry, old miser

218
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,240
with a killer
surveillance system.

219
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:10,376
Everyone picks on the miser.

220
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,544
Shave faster or no tip!

221
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,881
Oh, I shave-a faster, all right.

222
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,983
Hurry up.
I'm going to a funeral.

223
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,620
Oh, you're going to a funeral,
all right.

224
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,789
Oh, this is taking too long.

225
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:26,025
I got to stop procrastinating.

226
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,660
Then I got quiet
and thought about it.

227
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,029
It hit me that maybe God
isn't up there, you know.

228
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,231
Somewhere else.

229
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,866
Maybe God's right here and now.

230
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,734
As close as the air
on your skin.

231
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,936
For the first time ever,
I don't feel alone.

232
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,438
Life is worth living.

233
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,707
Hey, forget that hit
I called on myself, huh?

234
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,509
Yeah, well, I said too late.

235
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,844
Can't you just charge me
a stalking fee?

236
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,379
Okay, 40%.

237
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,581
And you can only cancel
on the app.

238
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,350
All right, I'll just...

239
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,118
My screen is frozen!

240
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,622
Maybe God is just
a word for a love

241
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,624
that we create
and remember together.

242
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,726
A love that isn't mad
at us for our doubt

243
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,495
or angry at us
because we're alcoholics.

244
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:08,434
Finally, recognized
for my accomplishments.

245
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,603
I think so many of us have
made a God that's like us,

246
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,038
instead of the other way around.

247
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,540
God loves diversity.

248
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,375
God didn't just make
one type of flower.

249
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,510
He made thousands
of different flowers...

250
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,078
roses, lilies, orchids...

251
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,780
and he made the weeds too.

252
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,615
But he loves all of them
indiscriminately.

253
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,217
Just like the bees.

254
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:27,887
You have made this bumblebee
a humble bee.

255
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,223
Jesus said, let the weeds
grow with the wheat.

256
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,791
That means it's all in the game.

257
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,126
Go easy on yourself.

258
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,827
You don't have
to earn God's love.

259
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,596
You are God's love.

260
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,097
All right, that's it.

261
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,566
I know it's early,
but it's a beautiful day.

262
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:40,900
Let's get out of here.

263
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,969
Sorry, concert's over, dude.

264
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,071
All that's left is the merch.

265
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:48,007
Bode! Bode! Bode!

266
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,311
Bode! Bode! Bode!

267
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,745
Three cheers
for Reverend Lovejoy.

268
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,280
Stupid Flanders.

269
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,316
Stupid Flanders!

270
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,951
Stupid Flanders!

271
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,786
I love church.

272
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,187
I won't be single in Heaven.

273
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:06,960
This was the best church ever.

274
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,395
It was like some kind
of religious experience.

275
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,164
Will you join us for pancakes?

276
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,632
Are those new vestments?

277
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,234
They really bring out the piety.

278
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,002
You don't have
to patronize me, Ned.

279
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,804
You're, you're right,
I'm sorry.

280
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,772
You did not do well today.

281
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,608
Oh, go back to patronizing.

282
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,977
Maybe something about my shoes?

283
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:28,081
Oh, look at those shoes, tied
so tight with loops so even.

284
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,516
Someone knows
the bunny ear technique.

285
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,085
Helen tied them.

286
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,922
Pastor, would you
like to say grace?

287
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,490
Lord...

288
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,158
Oh, sorry, I should
have been more specific.

289
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,561
I meant the cool new pastor
everyone likes.

290
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,630
You can sit down.

291
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,964
You know, I think
the food is good

292
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,132
without me saying it's good.

293
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,734
God made it good.

294
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,669
Don't get me wrong,
it's nice to be thankful, but

295
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,638
there's no need to make
everyone uncomfortable

296
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,473
by praying in front of 'em,
am I right?

297
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,242
Nice speech, although
longer than grace.

298
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,544
Oh, no bacon for me.

299
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,480
I'm a vegetarian.

300
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,749
And, actually, a Buddhist.

301
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,017
Great. I love Buddha.

302
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,184
That's where I got my name.

303
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,352
The Bodhi Tree.

304
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,520
And I don't eat meat either.

305
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:08,855
You're a vegetarian?

306
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,090
- What about evolution?
- Into it.

307
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,292
- Gay rights?
- Love is love.

308
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:13,893
- Dizzy or Bird?
- John Coltrane

309
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,195
and Duke Ellington, 1962.

310
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,398
The only way
to describe how perfect

311
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,534
that jazz answer is,
is with jazz.

312
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,244
This brunch has turned into...

313
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,212
a jazz brunch!

314
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,148
I'm a believer.

315
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,383
That's great, Lisa,
but I actually don't think

316
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,419
faith comes down
to what we believe.

317
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,187
Well, you got to believe
in this baloney.

318
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,056
That's how you get into Heaven.

319
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,291
Where maybe,
just maybe, I could see

320
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,794
the mother
that abandoned me again.

321
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,431
Yeah, sure, but I think together

322
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,067
we can bring Heaven here
while we're still alive.

323
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,302
There's a Chinese proverb
about Heaven and Hell.

324
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:59,038
They say Hell is a long table
like this, full of food,

325
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,974
but everybody's starving because
they have these long chopsticks,

326
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,744
like pool cues, and they can't
bring the food to their mouths.

327
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:07,246
This is the worst
Year of the Ox ever.

328
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,483
But in the proverb, Heaven is
the exact same table, same food,

329
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,319
same long chopsticks, but
everybody's happy and fat

330
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:14,987
because they're
feeding each other.

331
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:19,625
Wait, wait! I can be cool,
too... with humor.

332
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,627
Did you hear the one about
the Greek-Jewish wedding?

333
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,296
They didn't know whether
to break the plates

334
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,697
or the glasses!

335
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,801
Yes, why don't you take
your cultural insensitivity

336
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,604
back to the Spanish Inquisition
you came from?

337
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:32,805
I've lost them.

338
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,807
You never had us.

339
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,547
Timothy, the church council
wants to thank you

340
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,716
for your many years of...

341
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,051
Incompetence!

342
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,420
Knock his frock off.

343
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,622
We like the new guy
in his tight jeans.

344
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:52,125
Do not resuscitate your career.

345
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,993
What are you saying?
You're firing me?

346
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,529
- Gingo.
- Please surrender your cross.

347
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,164
We don't want any trouble.

348
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,368
Timothy.

349
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,174
Now the collar.

350
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,712
And any water
you turned into holy water

351
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,814
is once again regular water.

352
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,883
Nothing but tap.

353
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,760
Did you know Bode has
22,000 YouTube subscribers?

354
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,495
Our church could go viral.

355
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,798
Close window.

356
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,167
- You just subscribed.
- What? No.

357
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,535
Now you gave him a thumbs-up.

358
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,003
Stop telling me what I just did.

359
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,105
You just gave him
an eggplant emoji.

360
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,307
Well, at least
that can't be misconstrued.

361
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:42,775
Wait a minute.

362
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:45,044
The internet can help me.
Help me find something on him.

363
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,679
He's clean on Google.

364
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,214
I'll have to try Bing.

365
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,817
Sorry, I was asleep.

366
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,152
Do you really want to use us?

367
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,787
Yes.

368
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,789
Nothing.

369
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:58,357
But I'm not licked.

370
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,026
Pack your bags, Helen.

371
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,261
We are going to Michigan.

372
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,934
Reverend? We're here
for a little counseling?

373
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,368
Well, I'd be happy to.

374
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,437
But you're already with
the best counselor there is.

375
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:12,839
- Your partner.
- Wait.

376
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,106
But Marge always told me

377
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,008
communication is bad
for a marriage.

378
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,844
I said it was good.

379
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,178
You said what was good?

380
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,446
You just have to know
what it's like

381
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:21,881
to be in each other's shoes.

382
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,549
Literally.
Put on each other's shoes.

383
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:24,684
Right now.

384
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:27,787
All right. They...

385
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,859
Your shoes are so tight.

386
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,393
And you do so much work.

387
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,928
You're an angel.

388
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,864
And your shoes are so heavy.

389
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,500
I never realized
you carried around so much.

390
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,703
I'm starting to see the man
I fell in love with again.

391
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,104
Where? Where? I'll kill him!

392
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,073
You.

393
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,375
I must admit, this is amazing.

394
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:52,111
But what about the fact
that he sold our house?

395
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,113
- May I interject?
- Sure.

396
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,049
I've seen your house.
It'll never pass inspection.

397
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,885
- Are you sure?
- Piece of crap.

398
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:02,355
Thank you, Reverend.

399
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,330
Lisa. What brings you here?

400
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,900
Well, I thought it might be fun
if we meditate together.

401
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,335
Sure. Make yourself at om.

402
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:20,406
As meditation jokes go...

403
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:23,843
That's the only meditation joke
I've ever heard.

404
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,179
Alexa, play Meditation Jam.

405
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,352
You know,
science calls it consciousness,

406
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,022
the mystics call it a soul,
but both are just words,

407
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,857
just labels, for whatever it is

408
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:40,259
that's looking out your eyes
right now.

409
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,762
Breathe, Lisa.

410
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,175
Saw the button, huh?

411
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,644
I did.

412
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,480
Tim,

413
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,182
we could go to Mackinac Island.

414
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,751
They have the longest
hotel porch in the world.

415
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:41,988
It's always the big verandas
with you, isn't it, Helen?

416
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,422
You've done something
to this town

417
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,857
I never thought could happen.

418
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:47,493
A full-blown religious revival.

419
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,998
Yeah, let these
warm your insides

420
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:55,534
as the words of St. Paul
warm your soul, there.

421
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,637
Dear Ephesians...

422
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,705
and I'm, of course,
paraphrasing here...

423
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:03,342
believe in Christ or I'll hit
your head with a baseball bat.

424
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,577
I'll frickin' do it.

425
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,112
- Amen.
- Amen.

426
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,414
Hey, I'm not trying to
change any minds.

427
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,583
I'm just trying
to start a conversation.

428
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,753
We need that.
This town's like a snow globe.

429
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,289
It doesn't look like much
till you shake it up a little.

430
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:21,093
I want redemption
or else, dude.

431
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,695
Or else what?

432
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,563
Or Rabbi Mankiewicz will, dude.

433
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,033
And I have trouble
making that "cch" sound.

434
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,468
It's either Chanukah
or Hanukkah.

435
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,070
Okay? Pick one of those.

436
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,913
Teach a man to microfiche,

437
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,549
and you'll feed him dirt
for a lifetime.

438
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:47,620
Vengeance is mine,
sayeth the me.

439
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:52,491
We really should've digitized
that stuff.

440
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:59,331
Oh, I hope part two
is about my rescue.

441
00:20:09,944 --> 00:20:13,379
Next week on
Warrin' Priests Part Two...

442
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,214
I hear there's a little dirt

443
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,717
on the collar of a man
who used to preach here,

444
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,785
Bode Wright.

445
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:23,556
You, sir,
have challenged me on scripture.

446
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,625
Oh, well, if it's scripture
you want to talk,

447
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,461
then let us make a joyful noise

448
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,763
- unto the Lord.
- Good.

449
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,199
Yarr, activism means nothing

450
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,701
if it's not intersectional.
Yarr!

451
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:38,938
Next week on The Simpsons.
