{\an8}Ah, ah, ah.
I'd like to welcome

00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,366
{\an8}all of the principals

{\an8}We are here for the annual

{\an8}The union's happy,
the parents are placated,

18
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,929

00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:07,778
{\an8}Sociopathic child haters
who are only teachers

22
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,609
{\an8}because they got tenure

00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,105
{\an8}That's mean!

24
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,947
{\an8}You know what you are.

00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,540
{\an8}Uh, first lemon--
from Springfield Elementary,

27
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,000
{\an8}going to West Springfield,

28
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,791
{\an8}third grade teacher,
Sticky-Fingers Stella.

29
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,384
{\an8}Now, going to Springfield Elementary...

30
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,297
{\an8}God have mercy.

31
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,175
{\an8}Seymour, your new teacher is...

32
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,643
{\an8}Everybody pray!

33
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,273
{\an8}This is a public school.

34
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,640
{\an8}I said pray!

35
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,897
{\an8}Mr. Lassen is here.

36
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,240
{\an8}No smoking.

37
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,243
{\an8}So, Mr. Lassen,

38
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,872
{\an8}you began your career
at Shelbyville Prep.

39
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,990
{\an8}It seems that certain wealthy parents

40
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,457
{\an8}didn't like seeing their precious
darlings duct-taped to the wall.

41
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,379
{\an8}Mm-hmm.
And then you entered the public system.

42
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,628
{\an8}That's where I got this scar.

43
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,210
{\an8}What scar?

44
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,592
{\an8}Oh, I see you're left-handed.

45
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,466
{\an8}So, that concludes my evaluation.

46
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,973
{\an8}Enjoy fourth grade.

47
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,385
{\an8}So, any dirt on the new teacher?

48
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,894
{\an8}Is he stingy
with the pumpkin stickers?

49
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,107
{\an8}Does he have OCD? OCD? OCD?

50
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,768
I don't know, but in ten minutes,

51
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,317
I'm gonna have him kneeling before Zod.

52
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,152
In this example, I'm Zod.

53
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,992
(thumping)

54
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,083
When he opens the door...

55
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,119
That's kind of scary,

56
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,536
but it doesn't make me pee my pants.

57
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,416
-Hello.
-(screams)

58
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,632
I'm Mr. Lassen.

59
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,135
-You mean Mr. Less-than?
-(students giggle)

60
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,638
So, a comedian, are you?

61
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,811
I got a pretty solid ten minutes.

62
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,020
Well, I could do five minutes
on your pathetic vest

63
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,271
and five minutes
on your ugly buck teeth.

64
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,983
And I've got a whole HBO special's worth
on your fat mama!

65
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:14,315
My mom can't afford to be fat--
she's an exotic dancer.

66
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,612
(chuckling) Oh!

67
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:19,315
And in what exotic location
does she dance?

68
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,987
A Touch of Class.
But the "C-L" fell off.

69
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,246
Son, there was never a "C-L."

70
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,579
I-I think I always knew that!

71
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:27,674
(sobbing)

72
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:31,129
Bart, this guy served two tours
in middle school.

73
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,801
-Abort prank!
-I will not.

74
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,970
Anything to delay a spelling test.

75
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,469
(thumping)

76
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:45,016
Looks like I've got a prankster
on my hands.

77
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,179
(chuckles)

78
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:49,597
You know, son,
school code says a student's hair

79
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,357
should be of uniform length.

80
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,780
-What are you gonna do to him?
-Quiet... Smellson.

81
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,070
Smellson?
I prayed no one would ever think of that!

82
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,620
(razor buzzing)

83
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,704
<i>BART: Ay, caramba.</i>

84
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,213
-How was your first day at school, Bart?
-Terrible.

85
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,119
-You want to talk about it?
-No.

86
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,418
Oh, thank you.

87
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,291
Why are you wearing your hat at dinner?

88
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,548
This new teacher I got gave me a haircut.

89
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,550
-Hmm?
-A haircut? Let me see.

90
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,302
-No.
-Come on. Please?

91
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,224
No, you'll laugh at me.

92
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,512
I won't laugh at you. Let's see.

93
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,846
(laughing)

94
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,354
Look at me. I'm Bart.

95
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,765
We're sorry.

96
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,193
(laughing)

97
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,357
(laughing)

98
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,612
Stop that, all of you.

99
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,356
It's not Bart's fault that his haircut

100
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,277
-looks so stupid.
-(Homer giggles)

101
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,786
I didn't know that a teacher
could cut kids' hair.

102
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,158
Teachers' union won the right
in their last strike.

103
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,786
I'm going to go to that school
and talk to that teacher.

104
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,794
Marge, please don't say anything.

105
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:57,166
It never makes a difference,
and then the teachers give us stink-eye

106
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,965
during the school fairs.

107
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,628
Well, if he's gonna get a haircut,

108
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,547
Bart should at least
have gotten a balloon with it.

109
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,176
-(groans)
-(grumbles)

110
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:09,483
Well, anyway, Bart, you'll cheer up
on our camping trip this weekend.

111
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,729
What camping trip?

112
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,600
The one you booked for us at Owl Haven.

113
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:17,108
The one you have to reserve
a year in advance.

114
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:21,701
Oh, uh, you told me
not to do it a year ago. Remember?

115
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,699
-I don't remember that.
-You're right.

116
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:27,331
No one can be expected to remember
something from a year ago.

117
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,450
Certainly not me.
Pass the gravy.

118
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:32,917
(gasps) Don't tell me
you didn't reserve a campsite.

119
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,129
Labor Day is next weekend.
There'll be nothing left.

120
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,670
Hey, there's always room
at Buzzard's Roost.

121
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,085
Excuse me, but Buzzard's Roost
is a converted parking lot.

122
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,135
Excuse me,
but grass is poking through.

123
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,889
-Why do I ever put you in charge...
-LISA: Parking lot!

124
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,141
-...of the littlest thing?
-HOMER: Poking through!

125
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,432
-(crying)
-LISA: Parking lot!

126
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:53,345
-HOMER: Poking through!
-My biggest sin is that I dare to hope.

127
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,646
(crying)

128
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,689
Oh, Marge, I can't stand it
when you cry at dinner.

129
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,444
The pork chops look traumatized.

130
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,485
The mashed potatoes can't stand to watch.

131
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,569
Even the children seem upset.

132
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:07,414
So trust me,
I will come through for you, baby.

133
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,746
Not you.

134
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,408
So what do you say, Marge?

135
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,037
I want so much to believe you.

136
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,504
And I want you to believe me, too.

137
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,665
Isn't it great how much we agree?

138
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,587
Looks like our blackboard
has been defaced.

139
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,852
Lucky for you, I can take a joke.

140
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,521
(grunting)

141
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,890
Hello? Hello?
Is everything okay?

142
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,147
MILHOUSE: Here's... Millie!

143
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,020
Excuse me, you ruined my report.

144
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,648
Fine. You got an "A."

145
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,364
LISA:
Oh! Yippee! Fourth-grade "A"!

146
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,485
You might fool some people,
El Barto, but not me.

147
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,663
(electrical buzzing)

148
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,491
Now we're gonna learn
about electricity.

149
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,577
Hey, live wire. Come up here.

150
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,333
Touch the generator.

151
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,631
-Even I think this is too far.
-Quiet, Smellson.

152
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,512
It's sticking.

153
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,841
(grunting)

154
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,766
I just need to get to 60%.

155
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,606
Milhouse, I'm gonna get back at Lassen.

156
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,979
Now, <i>The Hobbit</i> taught us that
every dragon has a chink in its armor.

157
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,607
It also taught us that
New Zealand's beautiful landscapes

158
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:30,736
and attractive tax credits
add up to a filmmaker's paradise.

159
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:35,905
{\an8}For more information,
visit www.nzfilmhere.nz.

160
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,881
To find out Lassen's weakness,
I hid a camera in the teachers' lounge.

161
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,922
{\an8}<i>(grunting)</i>

162
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,678
{\an8}<i>Ach! Wrong order!</i>

163
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,481
{\an8}<i>You seem lonely and kind of weird.</i>

164
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,269
{\an8}<i>You left out "single."</i>

165
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,982
{\an8}<i>Mind if I heat up some goulash?</i>

166
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,652
{\an8}<i>Let's continue this online.</i>

167
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,399
I've created a fake Ms. Hoover profile.

168
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,867
When Lassen friends her,
we'll know everything about him.

169
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,198
I don't know, Bart.

170
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,293
You're lying about your identity?

171
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,538
That's against the terms and conditions.

172
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,541
We've all read
the terms and conditions, Milhouse.

173
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,924
Look, I really need a campsite.

174
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,961
My wife is making sandwiches.

175
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,625
Sorry,
reservations are a year in advance.

176
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,724
-What about Mosquito Cove?
-Booked.

177
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,719
-Skunk Canyon?
-Booked every year since 2003.

178
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:34,102
Ooh, how about the campsite
where the guy in the hockey mask

179
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,850
-kills all the campers?
-Sir, that's a movie.

180
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,062
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>
<i>This is Homer Simpson.</i>

181
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,976
<i>742 Evergreen Terrace.</i>

182
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,975
<i>Looking for a place</i>
<i>for my kids and me.</i>

183
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,777
<i>And my pretty, pretty wife.</i>

184
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,910
<i>You know, alarm code 3679.</i>

185
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,818
<i>3679!</i>

186
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,331
So I hear you're getting back at Lassen.

187
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,081
Maybe I am. So?

188
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,583
You got to do it, man.
He preys on the weak.

189
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,587
Now, give me your lunch money.

190
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,799
-I'll take that.
-(whimpers)

191
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,006
(cat screeches)

192
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,013
Here's Lassen's profile.

193
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,684
What the...

194
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,893
Tagged as Lassen?

195
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:18,894
(groans)

196
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,515
It says these were taken at Blazing Guy.

197
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,653
What's Blazing Guy?

198
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,106
Oh, that's convenient.

199
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,441
<i>Helloha.</i>

200
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:32,066
Do you want to make your home
in a self-sustaining city

201
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:35,124
that only exists a few days a year?

202
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,119
One that combines nudity, dust storms,

203
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,752
children, and all-consuming fires?

204
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,171
Then you, my bro or brah,

205
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,880
are dreaming of Blazing Guy.

206
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,512
On the last day,

207
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,839
the chosen one, or Ignis,

208
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,514
sets fire to the giant wooden Guy

209
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,925
in a ritual dating back to 1986.

210
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,846
The Blazing Guy Council of Elders,
in conjunction with Duraflame,

211
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:09,106
is very pleased to announce
that this year's Ignis is Jack Lassen.

212
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,401
-(both gasp)
-So if we go there with a camera

213
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,065
to film Lassen humiliating himself,

214
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,704
I'll get revenge for him
making me into this.

215
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,531
(chuckles)

216
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,987
I was trying to even it out.

217
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,196
You're starting to look like your dad.

218
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,537
No.

219
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,882
I'm lucky.
I look just like my mom.

220
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,168
(both grunting)

221
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:34,181
Gosh, that was a hard
sleeping bag to roll up.

222
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,638
Those were your father's sweatpants.

223
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:40,969
(sighs) Marge, I have a confession
to make about this trip.

224
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,387
(quietly) Dad, don't worry.
I got you a place.

225
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,476
Hmm? Once again, I've been saved
from any consequences.

226
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,193
It'll keep happening till one day

227
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,363
I create a mess so enormous
it can't be cleaned up.

228
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,903
Thanks, boy.

229
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,743

236
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,556
(Homer laughs)

237
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,099
Homer Simpson, I love you.

238
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,017
Oh.

239
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:34,276
(gasps)
A world of anarchic free expression.

240
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,530
Cars shaped like cupcakes!

241
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,162
BOTH: I'm home.

242
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,030
-(gasps)
-No, no, no, don't blow me out, wise guy.

243
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,948
Not in the mood.

244
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,043
(groans)

245
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,509
I'm not sure this campground
is family-friendly.

246
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,434
All camping is pointless.

247
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,893
You drive hundreds of miles
to shower and sleep

248
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,524
in a place with no bathroom or bed.

249
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,351
I guess what I'm trying to say is
where's Maggie?

250
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,108
(groans, screams)

251
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,113
We brought Cheerios for you.

252
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,203
Now, you know the wind
does kick up here.

253
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,781
Hope you went three feet down
with your tent stakes.

254
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,117
Uh, listen here, Desert Arnaz.

255
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,253
Homer Simpson
knows how to pitch a tent.

256
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,165
Hey, man, can I bum a tent?

257
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,253
(groans)

258
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,467
You seem stressed.
Have some calming tea.

259
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,549
Finally. A normal person.

260
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,795
Ah. Thank you, Miss, um...

261
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,848
Calypso Self-Knowledge.

262
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,273
Is that tea... adulterated?

263
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,112
Does that look like something I'd do?

264
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,067
HOMER: Hey, Marge.

265
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,320
We got a new tent
from a guy who just O.D.'d.

266
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,822
Aw, let me get a picture of that.

267
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,578
-(alarm whooping)
-(cell phone chimes)

268
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,749
BOTH: Aw.

269
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,789
I think Smitty's still inside.

270
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,423
Oh, too bad he's missing this.

271
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,840
So many musical choices.

272
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,129
A brass band.

273
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,422
Barbershop quintet?

274
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,836
The human kazoo.

275
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,344
Oh, a drum circle.

276
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,836
(rhythmic drumming)

277
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,099
(all playing)

278
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,196
Uh... can I help you, freak?

279
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,948
No.

280
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,070
(plays a sad tune)

281
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,366
BART: There he is.

282
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:52,623
(gasps)
His nipples are asymmetrical.

283
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,166
This could ruin him.

284
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,170
Milhouse, everyone here is a total freak.

285
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,092
We have to find a way
to completely humiliate Lassen.

286
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,171
Get a picture
of a restaurant check with no tip,

287
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,178
put it online, say it was him.

288
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,180
Kaboom, he's finished.

289
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,484
Mmm.

290
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,733
Mmm.

291
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,692
Oh.

292
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:21,442
Suddenly this place doesn't seem so bad.

293
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,027
This place is great.

294
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,532
Just have to avoid
these inseam-high cactuses.

295
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,284
{\an8}Hup, hup.

296
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,826
{\an8}D'oh!

297
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:32,249
Oh. Are you Mr. Clean?

298
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,499
(scoffs) Compared to the rest
of these people, yeah.

299
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,003
{\an8}So give the Tooth Fairy
my forwarding address,

300
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,205
{\an8}'cause it's pretty loose.

301
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,876
About time. It's the only phone.

302
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,925
You don't count.

303
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,310
Maybe we should just give up on Lassen.

304
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,928
No. This Ignis thing
is the biggest deal of his life.

305
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,596
And I'm gonna wreck it.
Because he scarred me forever.

306
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,726
Hey, it grew back.
A little better, even.

307
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,904
-So full and lush.
-Enough.

308
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,744
Mmm.

309
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:08,989
It's like someone ironed out
all the wrinkles in my brain.

310
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,334
(gasps)

311
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,489
(upbeat tune playing)

312
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,016
(wind whistling)

313
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,863
Get in the tent.

314
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,117
D'oh!

315
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:58,286
Oh, you always save me,
trombone elephant.

316
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,094
(imitates elephant)

317
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,884
BART: Hmm. Fire retardant?

318
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,312
If Lassen can't light that thing,
he'll be humiliated.

319
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,269
What good is an Ignis
who can't blaze the guy?

320
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,940
I'm scared, Bart.

321
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,018
And I am never scared.

322
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,154
(gasps)

323
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,731
Hideous.

324
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,995
(loud beeping)

325
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,999
These kids are gonna ruin the ceremony.

326
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,081
It's too bad I'm just an illusion.

327
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,929
Homie, you promised me
an incredible camping trip,

328
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,473
and I got one.

329
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,306
Just like I planned.

330
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,101
You got very lucky this time.

331
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,145
-Don't push it.
-I understand.

332
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,820
I already signed up
for this place next year.

333
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:09,899
I gave my form
and $200 cash to that dude.

334
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,567
D'oh!

335
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,065
(drums, saxophone, kazoo playing)

336
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,787
Ignis, approach the Burning Man.

337
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,422
I mean Blazing Guy.

338
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,256
(crowd groaning)

339
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,522
Get the job done.

340
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,061
You're not helping.

341
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,725
(crowd boos, hisses)

342
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,107
Strip him of his nudity.

343
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,238
(laughing)

344
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,829
-You.
-(both gasp)

345
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,376
Maybe we won't have Blazing Guy,
but we can still have...

346
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,961
Blazing Boy.

347
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,416
What, uh...

348
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,926
-(tooting)
-(screaming)

349
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,970
Help me, desert weirdos.

350
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,637
(both gasp)

351
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,685
I'll take those.

352
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,976
Beware the butterfly's sting.

353
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,857
What the...

354
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,954
(creaks)

355
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,582
Form a human prison

356
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,369
and hold him for five days.

357
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,995
No. (grunts)

358
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,004
Wait, how many days?

359
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,046
(laughing)

360
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,130
Hey, listen,
we should probably get home.

361
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,045
My dad forgot to bring water.
(smacks tongue)

362
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,351
Whoa.

363
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,310
When will this tea get out of my system?

364
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,440
(upbeat tune playing)

365
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,989
Haw haw!

366
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,834
What the...

367
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,921
According to this file
from Blazing Guy Secret Security,

368
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,005
your behavior was so egregious

369
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,760
we can do something
that we've never done before--

370
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,183
-fire a teacher.
-Hand in your red pen.

371
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,145
Oh. Not gonna pass
fingernail inspection tonight.

372
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,438
So where do you go from here?

373
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,021
A place where my talents
will be appreciated.

374
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,227
All right, lights out.

375
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,159
You, too, freak.

376
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,819
(groans)

377
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,868
You hate him, too?

378
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:06,041
With every fiber of what's left
of my wretched soul.

379
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,291
We should team up.
I can get you out of here.

380
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,423
A partner? Intriguing.

381
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,790
Who gets to gut him
like a little pot-bellied salmon?

382
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,708
-I assumed we'd take turns.
-No deal.

383
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,632
♪♪

384
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,144
-(crowd murmuring)
-Shh.
