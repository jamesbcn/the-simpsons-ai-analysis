1
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,479
D'oh!

2
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,029
- No electricity.
- D'oh!

3
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:43,677
Hardest test in the world?
Who'd want to do that?

4
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:48,449
Oh, hey, Bart.
What you doing?

5
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,884
They say this one single test

6
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,953
can tell if you're
a genius or not.

7
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,855
Looks pretty simple to me.

8
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,558
It says only one
out of every 400 people

9
00:00:57,591 --> 00:01:01,362
has the spatial reasoning
to solve this maze.

10
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,232
Elon Musk and Anjela Merkel
both got perfect scores.

11
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:06,066
Angela. Angela.

12
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,036
Oh, if you're so smart,
let's see you solve the maze.

13
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,139
Let me at it!

14
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,978
Okay, got through the first one.

15
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,449
Next one's a little harder.
Just gonna focus.

16
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,290
You passed the test, genius.

17
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:31,091
Epic sister fail!

18
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,993
You better not post that!

19
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,063
And... post.

20
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:40,934
You scared me and
denied me a genius test!

21
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,936
Well, when you got
an opportunity to prank,

22
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,272
you gotta take it.

23
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:45,673
Gotta take it.

24
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:48,442
And the likes are pouring in.

25
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:52,012
Whoa! Sideshow Mel retweeted it
to all his boneheads.

26
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:54,815
Are you almost done?

27
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,851
You have your office.
This is mine!

28
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:04,992
I don't know how,
I don't know when,

29
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:09,797
but I super know why I'll get
revenge on you, Bart Simpson.

30
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,500
Will you be wearing my
underpants when that happens?

31
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,002
And post.

32
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:18,005
Post. Post. Post.

33
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:21,475
Unpost! Unpost!

34
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,444
And post.

35
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,219
The internet is down!

36
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:32,486
I don't know the score.

37
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,288
I don't even remember
who's playing.

38
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:37,825
Okay, no internet.

39
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:40,361
We can do what we did
in the olden days,

40
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,863
when I was a child.

41
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,566
You better not be suggesting
a board game.

42
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,569
I'm not playing anything
with you ever again.

43
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:51,038
Okay, fine. No board games.

44
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:53,040
Dumb. Useless.

45
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:55,476
Piece missing.

46
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,478
So flammable.

47
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,580
Okay, look, the TV still works,

48
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:02,383
and I know we've seen
all our DVDs a hundred times,

49
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,152
so this could be
the perfect time to break out...

50
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,688
Daddy's VHS collection.

51
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,224
Classic moments from a time
when people used to

52
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:13,827
tape the shows they loved,
then never watch the tape again.

53
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,162
Family Matters?

54
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,030
It certainly does.

55
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:18,532
The Tracey Ullman Show?

56
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:20,534
Well, I've had my fill.

57
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:22,002
Saved by the Bell?

58
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,172
The hit show
that launched no one's career.

59
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,442
Now for the simple task
of hooking up the VCR.

60
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:32,413
Okay, I need to connect
magenta to magenta,

61
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,181
set the tracking.

62
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,217
Marge, did I record these
in long play or extended play?

63
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:40,120
- What's the difference?
- Long is shorter.

64
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:43,123
Gross!
The remote has a cord on it.

65
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,359
My first remote.

66
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:48,529
Coincidentally,
the same time I got fat.

67
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:51,632
What is that noise?

68
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,267
It's rewinding.

69
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:55,969
Listen to it speed up
as it gets closer.

70
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,242
Well, that was fun.
Good night.

71
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:04,011
No, now we play it.

72
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:09,917
<i>Ri-cola!</i>

73
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,420
I used to love that commercial.

74
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:15,155
Remember when I went as
the horn for Halloween?

75
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,558
<i>Ri-cola!</i>

76
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,800
<i>Let's get physical, physical</i>

77
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:30,270
<i>I want to get physical...</i>

78
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,145
No worries.

79
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:40,748
We just have to find
a VCR repair store.

80
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,151
I'll look online, which I can't
because there's no internet!

81
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,520
Damn it!
Lisa, solve this.

82
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:48,989
I've solved
enough puzzles today.

83
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,328
Well, Flanders' network
is working.

84
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:55,996
Maybe we could ask him
for the password.

85
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,500
You can't just ask someone
for their password. That's rude.

86
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,469
Come on, boy,
let's go borrow his router.

87
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,604
How come all our father-son
activities involve

88
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,205
getting a TV back on?

89
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,875
What about the time I watched
you get out of that thing?

90
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,378
- You mean when I was born?
- That was fun.

91
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:18,118
If I die before I wake,

92
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,689
I pray the Lord
my soul to take. Amen.

93
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:23,190
That's right, boys.

94
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:27,094
Think about your possible deaths
as you go to sleep.

95
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,833
Now let's look at my plans.

96
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,375
Who's this ladder
made for, babies?

97
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:43,243
D'oh!

98
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,149
- You'll have to climb it, boy.
- I'm a little scared.

99
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,652
Scared? What do we give you
those meds for?

100
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,253
So you can do less parenting?

101
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,889
Babysitter in a bottle.

102
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:58,426
Now climb the ladder.

103
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,600
So beautiful.

104
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:09,737
Almost there. You just need
to go up the last rung.

105
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,839
That's not a rung, it's the top.

106
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,374
- The top is a rung.
- No, it's not!

107
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:17,077
- Let me check on Google.
- We don't have internet!

108
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,346
Maybe if I keep refreshing,
it'll come back.

109
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,049
Refresh. Refresh. Refresh.

110
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:25,753
Refresh. Refresh. Refresh.

111
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,020
Oh, this is pointless.

112
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:30,424
Refresh. Refresh. Refresh.

113
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,959
Ooh! No.

114
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:35,429
Refresh. Refresh. Refresh.

115
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,201
You guys need jackets!

116
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,236
No, we're fine! D'oh!

117
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:48,241
The internet's back on!

118
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:58,786
Doctor, is he gonna
be all right?

119
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,954
Millions of volts
coursed through his body.

120
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:03,123
But it was the amps
that really messed with him.

121
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,493
But he should be fine.
According to his chart,

122
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:07,961
Bart's had more comas
than he's had hot breakfasts.

123
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:10,330
Well, I can't cook
every morning.

124
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,232
Until he recovers,
just talk to him.

125
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,468
Lightning victims
are highly suggestible.

126
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:17,938
Your kind words could turn
his coma into a trip to Hawaii,

127
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,273
or a golf excursion
to St. Andrews,

128
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,576
which is where I'm heading now.

129
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,250
Well, when you got
an opportunity to prank,

130
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,652
you gotta take it.

131
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,286
Gotta take it.

132
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,122
But you're in a coma.

133
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,126
Fine, I'll get revenge.

134
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:45,633
You're gonna see dragons
with pools of blood.

135
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,801
Oh, right, you like that.

136
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:49,937
Okay, scratch the dragons.

137
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,774
You're gonna see the one thing
everyone's afraid of, death.

138
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,944
And dead people.
That's right, buddy.

139
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,450
<i>Right and left</i>

140
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,519
<i>And right and right and left</i>

141
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:07,855
<i>Left, left, left,
right, right, right</i>

142
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:11,692
<i>It's Bart's
unconscious brain!</i>

143
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:18,799
Okay, Bart,
your nightmare begins.

144
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:26,039
What happened?

145
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:28,742
How long was I out?

146
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,754
Maude Flanders!
I thought you were dead!

147
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:43,591
I am.

148
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,163
Sweetie, we're gonna
get something to eat.

149
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,833
- You want to come?
- I'd rather stay with Bart.

150
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,236
In fact, I'd like to stay
with him all night.

151
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,740
- Such a sweet girl.
- So sweet.

152
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:08,248
Someone's not happy.

153
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,351
You know, that sign
should be unnecessary.

154
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,922
I'd better cheer him up.

155
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,026
I'm going to add to your dream

156
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,394
the worst thing I can imagine!

157
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,731
Let me see. Let me see.

158
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:27,067
Wazzup...?!

159
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,136
Milhouse.

160
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,808
What's going on, Bart?

161
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:38,078
Are you into God now?
I always was.

162
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,080
Look at those abs.

163
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:43,316
The secret is less loaves,
more fishes.

164
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,085
I don't believe in
some dopey religion.

165
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,254
This is to keep out ghosts.

166
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:51,158
Oh, this looks just like
my first apartment with Ned.

167
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,160
I'm never leaving!

168
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,928
Milhouse, have you ever
been haunted?

169
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:58,098
Once, my hamster died
and then came back.

170
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,100
Actually, my parents
bought a new one

171
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,735
and thought I wouldn't know.

172
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:04,504
Then my dad's check bounced,
and they repo'd the hamster.

173
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,840
You've got to talk to me, Bart.

174
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:10,110
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone!

175
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,412
The power of Homer's socks
compels you!

176
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,450
Maybe you could use this,
my therapist.

177
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,419
If you see him,
can you give him this?

178
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,521
Don't tell him
I forgot to bring it back.

179
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,456
He'll say I kept it
to get attention.

180
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,360
I don't need attention, Dr. Sam!

181
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,863
I knew it was Milhouse.
I knew it!

182
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:31,531
What's on your mind, son?

183
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,467
I'm scared to say.
You'll toss me in the loony bin.

184
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:37,470
Bart, these days,
there are no more loony bins.

185
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,539
All those people
are on the streets.

186
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,976
- So how can I help you?
- I've been talking to a ghost.

187
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,445
I know, you think I'm
the nuttiest kid you've seen.

188
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,380
Oh, please, I can't tell you
what a relief it is

189
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:49,149
to not be talking to Milhouse.

190
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,218
Are you allowed
to say stuff like that?

191
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:52,552
No, but screw it.

192
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,221
My mom found

193
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,724
my dad's other cell phone,
boo-hoo.

194
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,160
So you don't think I'm crazy?

195
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,495
No. Take a look
behind the couch.

196
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,635
You're dead too?

197
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,071
Yeah, I killed myself five
minutes before you got here.

198
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,173
Why would you kill yourself?

199
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:16,243
Oh, I want my patients to think
it's all their fault.

200
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,578
Oh, if you'd been on time,
you might've saved my life,

201
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,813
but, you know, whatever.

202
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:23,016
Why is this happening to me?

203
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,918
I don't know,
but you have a gift!

204
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:27,254
You can see the dead, Bart.

205
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,922
Why am I waiting for a bus?

206
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:31,191
I can appear and disappear
whenever I want.

207
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,226
And it's late.

208
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,564
That's far enough.

209
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:40,734
And, Bart, you can
help us ghosts move on to

210
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:42,602
what comes next.

211
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,537
By telling your family
you love them?

212
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,706
Which family?
I've led a complicated life.

213
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,709
No, to move on, I need you
to get revenge on Dr. Morton,

214
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:51,278
with whom I share the office.

215
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,746
What have you got against him?

216
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,916
He won't shut up
about his Tesla.

217
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,621
Yes, yes, just as smart
as I always thought I...

218
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:07,460
Thank you, Bart.
Now I can move on.

219
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,300
Wow, helping him
felt really good.

220
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,303
- Help us, Bart.
- Help us.

221
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,605
Settle our beefs.

222
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,740
Beefs!

223
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:24,377
<i>Please help me get vengeance
against all jet engines</i>

224
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,314
<i>And then I will go to hell</i>

225
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,950
Didn't anybody finish
their business before dying?

226
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,052
All I want to do
is return this hatchet.

227
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,553
Fine.

228
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,588
Okay, I want you
to whack Johnny Tightlips,

229
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,725
ice Fat Tony and put a hit
on Joey Doublecross.

230
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,828
Who would've figured
he'd rat me out?

231
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,704
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Next.

232
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,492
You can't keep ignoring me!

233
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:18,265
Doctor, shouldn't he have
woken up by now?

234
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,200
Yes, he should.

235
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:23,303
Unless someone's been
telling him bad things.

236
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,472
- What do you mean?
- Anything negative someone says

237
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,607
could do permanent damage
to his brain function.

238
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,442
It could even kill him.

239
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,344
But you said he'd be fine!

240
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,113
I said he'd be fine
if you told him

241
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,315
he was at
a dolphin encounter on Maui.

242
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:39,352
But those dolphins aren't fine!
They try to kill themselves!

243
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:42,389
I said he'd be fine,
not the dolphins.

244
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,693
Bart! Bart. I'm sorry.

245
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:49,729
I'm so sorry.
I'll watch everything I say.

246
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:52,699
I had to walk
nine blocks to get this.

247
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:55,035
I am dead.

248
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,070
- Dad, no!
- Nine blocks.

249
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:59,239
I am dead.

250
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:02,142
Dead, dead.
Dead, dead, dead.

251
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:06,346
Finally, you get to me.

252
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,748
Yeah, yeah, what's your
unfinished business?

253
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:12,886
Revenge, against the man
who caused my death.

254
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,256
Hey, T-shirt, T-shirt, T-shirt!

255
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,091
Fire!

256
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,593
Ooh, a bobby pin!

257
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,400
You mean the guy
who invented the T-shirt guns?

258
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,769
- No.
- The guys who built the stadium

259
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,505
- with a really low back wall?
- No.

260
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,374
You, for standing up?

261
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,610
No, your father,
your stupid, stupid father!

262
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,880
You know, some people grow
when they die. Not you.

263
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:43,116
See you, guys.

264
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,419
That was fun, getting every
answer in Jeopardy! wrong.

265
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:50,723
All that saying good-bye
really made me thirsty.

266
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,561
Maude Flanders says hello.

267
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:57,064
Hello.

268
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,236
Let's move!

269
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:07,540
Oh, thank you, Bart.
I'm finally at peace.

270
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,942
You know, Ned remarried.

271
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:11,644
He what?!

272
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:14,414
Well, that's it.
All the ghosts have been helped.

273
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:15,815
Except one.

274
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,951
Dad, you weren't
supposed to die.

275
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:20,287
It was, it was just
supposed to scare you.

276
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,388
Oh, don't worry.

277
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,590
Patricide is just
a part of life.

278
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:27,460
Ooh, your vocabulary
really goes up when you die.

279
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,999
Dad, I am so sorry I killed you.

280
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:33,967
It's cool.
I feel no pain.

281
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,604
Ooh, I was wrong.

282
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,606
It feels worse than in life.

283
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,641
Get away, you stupid cat!

284
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,910
D'oh!

285
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,912
Oh, I can't believe you're dead.

286
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,847
But at least
I can still see you,

287
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,617
while I help you
with your unfinished business.

288
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,519
Well, I wanted
to lose some weight,

289
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,954
but I'm light as a feather now.

290
00:15:57,157 --> 00:16:01,094
All that's left is for me
to go into the light.

291
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,831
You know how much
you hate walking.

292
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:05,999
Stay with me.

293
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:08,801
Stay with me, Bart.
Stay with me.

294
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,639
Oh, Homie.
It's not your fault.

295
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,641
You were doomed when
they started putting cheese

296
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,343
into pizza crust.

297
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:19,812
What's next, plugging
Swiss cheese with cookie dough?

298
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:22,182
Peanut butter and hot dogs?

299
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,617
Why isn't anyone
writing these things down?

300
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:31,091
I can't watch this.
I'm gonna go check in on Moe's.

301
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,063
I don't know what's wrong.
I served them lager.

302
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:38,465
I should go, son.

303
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,400
I leave this world
without a care,

304
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,402
knowing I raised two great kids,

305
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,338
plus the one who murdered me.

306
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,243
No, Bart,
you have to stay with me!

307
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,347
No, Dad,
you have to stay with me!

308
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,183
No, my time has come.

309
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:59,552
Man was not meant to live
beyond the age of 39.

310
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:00,753
You have to stay.

311
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,755
If you leave,
Mom will marry someone else.

312
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:04,157
I want her to be happy.

313
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,093
And someone else
will raise your kids!

314
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,660
Sucker.

315
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,097
And someone else
will ride your mower.

316
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,099
That bastard!

317
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:15,135
Still, it's time
for me to move on.

318
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:21,541
Oh, my God.
It's so beautiful!

319
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,287
Dad!

320
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:37,257
Why you little life-saving,

321
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,259
heaven can waiting...!

322
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:43,096
Bart, I'm so sorry
if I was ever mean to you,

323
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,434
because even though
you started it, you...

324
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,270
Sorry, sorry, I'm past that.

325
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,441
I love you,

326
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:57,810
and I want you back,
Bart Simpson.

327
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,714
Lisa?

328
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,783
He's awake!

329
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,286
- Thank God.
- Lisa?

330
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:09,822
Have you been by my side
this whole time?

331
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:11,424
I have.

332
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,926
Were you putting
those bad dreams in my head?

333
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,262
Yes.

334
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,397
- Can you teach me how to do it?
- I guess.

335
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,299
And can you help me
put Dad in a coma?

336
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:20,633
No.

337
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,971
Oh, man, this is great.

338
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,440
But how do I know
this isn't a dream too?

339
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,642
Because you're not
wearing the sweater.

340
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,911
Oh, yeah, of course.

341
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,846
Wait a minute.

342
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,249
How did he know
about the sweater?

343
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,325
Bart, did you see anything else
when you were under?

344
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,859
Just how we're all gonna die.

345
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,861
- Want me to tell you?
- Not really.

346
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,497
Well, I'm gonna tell you anyway.

347
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,931
<i>Ouch</i>

348
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:56,035
<i>I have lost myself again</i>

349
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:03,310
<i>Lost myself
and I am nowhere...</i>

350
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:06,379
I knew it was a sandwich.

351
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:08,315
<i>Yeah...</i>

352
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,990
<i>Lost myself again</i>

353
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:22,562
<i>And I feel unsafe</i>

354
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:25,265
<i>Be my friend</i>

355
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,638
<i>Hold me</i>

356
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,507
<i>Wrap me up</i>

357
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,010
<i>Unfold me</i>

358
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:44,551
<i>I am small</i>

359
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:46,319
<i>I'm needy...</i>

360
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,087
Oh, my God!

361
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,492
Now I realize, this has
all been a waste of time.

362
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,495
<i>And breathe me</i>

363
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,063
<i>Be my friend</i>

364
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:04,337
<i>Hold me, wrap me up</i>

365
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,473
Now I'm the evil king.

366
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:11,244
<i>Unfold me</i>

367
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:16,215
<i>I am small</i>

368
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:18,951
<i>I'm needy</i>

369
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:22,955
<i>Warm me up</i>

370
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:29,128
<i>And breathe</i>

371
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,163
<i>Me</i>
