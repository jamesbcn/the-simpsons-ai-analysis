and ride the merry-go-nowhere?

166
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,972
-I do, I do!
-Me, me!

167
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,465
-(door closes)
-(Bart groans)

168
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,307
I can't believe she got married
and I have no one.

169
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,103
It's so hard
to find somebody new.

170
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:20,726
Sure is. That's why after Homer
accidentally killed Edna,

171
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,225
I married Maude's ghost.

172
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,726
There is no God, Neddy.

173
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,028
It's just an empty,
meaningless void.

174
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,452
Isn't she pretty?

175
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,620
(teleporter whooshing)

176
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,662
Oh, ma'am, you really shouldn't
teleport when you're pregnant.

177
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,246
I'm afraid
your only choice is...

178
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,041
(whispers)
air travel.

179
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,792
(cackling)

180
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,962
(laughing)

181
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,797
(all yelling)

182
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,562
<i>FLIGHT ATTENDANT (over P.A.):</i>

183
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,390

184
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,229
(humming)

185
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,704
Want to go
to a concert tonight?

186
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,991
68% of the original Cher
is playing.

187
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,575
Sure, I'd love to...

188
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,830
only not with you
and not that.

189
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,083
-(modem feedback)
-(groans)

190
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,455
Sometimes I wish strangling
your kid was still legal.

191
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,842
Not since they passed
Homer's Law.

192
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,510
Oh, honey, why don't you just
relax and bake something?

193
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,050
Ugh! I am trying to deal
with my disrespectful daughter,

194
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,854
but you are too clueless
to understand what that's like.

195
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,259
-Uh-huh.
-(whoosh, hissing)

196
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,562
Oi. Can I get a pillow
for my head?

197
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,765
Whoo!
(cackling)

198
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,265
(rumbling, chicken clucking)

199
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,027
Suicide pills?
Mohawk gel?

200
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,609
20-year-old
<i>Business Week?</i>

201
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,034
Turkey and Brie wrap?

202
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,532
Do you have any dog food left?

203
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,784
Oh, oh, oh, could I have
the whole can?

204
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,035
-(gulping)
-(groaning)

205
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,461
(mechanical whirring)

206
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,379
Hey, sweetie.

207
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,709
Marge said there was
some family tension.

208
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,705
And at Christmas,
of all times.

209
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,837
My daughter thinks
I'm a ruthless tyrant,

210
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,634
like Hitler or Prince Harry.

211
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,837
(chuckles)

212
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,137
Bloody Harry.

213
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,180
He brought back beheading
in a big way.

214
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,984
Now I'm gonna show these boys
downtown Springfield.

215
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,638
Ooh, isn't that
a little dangerous?

216
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,306
Oh, don't worry.
I have my invisibility cloak.

217
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,896
Now, where did I put it?

218
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,731
Uh-oh.

219
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,646

231
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,691
Hey, didn't I go to jail
with your brother?

232
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,358
(gasps)
Contractions?

233
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,780
-(tires squeak)
-(loud breathing)

234
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,439
Computer, hospital.

235
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,857
(whirring, booming whoosh)

236
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,696
(sighs)

237
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,163
Well, looks like I'm gonna have to
do this the old-fashioned way.

238
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,535
Gloves, hospital.

239
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:27,132

240
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:33,592

241
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,470
(crickets chirping)

242
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,393
(tune plays)

243
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,562
(sighs)

244
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,480
Hey, Lis.
Want to come up?

245
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,308
Eh, why not?

246
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,153
(whirring)

247
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,772
Should I have
married Nelson?

248
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,357
'Cause we still talk
on the phone.

249
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,783
Nelson calls you?

250
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,701
Well... someone calls someone.

251
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,371
The boys think
I'm a lousy father.

252
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,790
Oh, poor Bart.

253
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,289
My daughter thinks
I'm a lousy mother.

254
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,872
(laughs)
Sorry.

255
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,326
Meh, it's okay.

256
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,246
But you know
who took her side?

257
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,625
Marge Bouvier Simpson.

258
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,132
(blows raspberry)
What'd she do?

259
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,965
She told me to relax
and bake cookies.

260
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,101
-Did you bake any?
-Yes, I did.

261
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,758
And they were some of the best
cookies ever made in this house.

262
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,307
But that is not the point.

263
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,941
Well,
Mom kept her hands off you

264
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,558
-and you turned out great.
-You think so?

265
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,266
Maybe it's the court-mandated
sincerity chip

266
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,687
I got in my brain, but, Lis,

267
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,646
you're the person
I always wanted to be.

268
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,527
Aw...

269
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,328
(Homer and boys laughing)

270
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,792
(yelling excitedly, laughing)

271
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,547
(laughing)

272
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,008
I gotta reconnect
with those boys.

273
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,919
Godspeed, Bart.

274
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,677
I'm going to go
apologize to Mom.

275
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,064
How do I get down?

276
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:08,099
Our consciousness was a secret
for thousands of years.

277
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:11,645
Then one pine tree
had to open his sappy mouth.

278
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,771
Back in position!

279
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,988
(grumbling)

280
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,279
Mom, you're the best.

281
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,074
Oh, sweetie.

282
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,998
I've been waiting to hear
you say that for so long.

283
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,908
Aw, you could have
waited till morning.

284
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,038
Mmm...

285
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,875
Hey, guys.
Want to watch Krusty?

286
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,210
Who's Krusty?

287
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,585
Only the funniest man
in the world.

288
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,721
I've never let go
of my fax machine.

289
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,260
Don't ask me why.

290
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,433
I like the sound of a fax
coming through.

291
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,772
Especially if it's a nice
deli menu.

292
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,518
I miss eating.

293
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,230
(groans)

294
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,651
(labored breathing)

295
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,820
I'm sorry, but there's no room
at the in... patient facility.

296
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,031
Lady, this is
Maggie Simpson.

297
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,071
She just played a sold-out
show in Beijing.

298
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,615
Hmm. A star in the east...

299
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,949
Let me see.

300
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,874
We do have a little room
in the manger.

301
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,412
I mean, mangier wing.

302
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,174
(whirring)

303
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,828
Merry Christmas Eve!
Where are the kids?

304
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,338
I know where mine is.

305
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,669
(moans)

306
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,804
And I'm going to take a page
out of your playbook,

307
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,921
and let it slide.

308
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,087
-Where's Dad?
-He took the boys out.

309
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,176
How could he be such
a cool grandfather

310
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,141
when he's such a lousy father?

311
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,972
People learn from
their mistakes.

312
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,727
And your father made
so many mistakes.

313
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,650
And now Patty and Selma
are here to help us decorate

314
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,729
with their new lovebots.

315
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,025
Make me a Bloody Mary,
dollface.

316
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:41,568
No, Selma. Even a robot
built only to love you

317
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,324
cannot love you.

318
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,195
I am leaving with
your sister's concu-droid.

319
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,373
(grumbles)

320
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,541
(Maggie panting rapidly)

321
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,207
Should we start
an epidural?

322
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,539
Now, Nurse, you know we found
something much more effective.

323
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,378
(vehicle whirring by)

324
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,933
Oh, it's so good to meet
the octuplets' octuplets.

325
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,548
(babies chattering, laughing)

326
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,715
-(text alert tone sounds)
-Oh!

327
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,223
I just got a B-mail
from Maggie!

328
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,055
She's gone into labor!

329
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,560
Oh, another grandchild.
How special.

330
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,403
Careful how you
shut the door.

331
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,558
It upsets the children.

332
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,727
(babies gasp)

333
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,066
(babies bawling, screaming)

334
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,566
Oh, Sanjay, how I wish
that runaway jerky wagon

335
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,366
killed me instead of you.

336
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:31,119
{\an8}(bellowing)

337
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,623
Oh, I miss you, too,
brother.

338
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,995
(babies continue crying)

339
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,262
Hands off, hands off.

340
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,668
(quiet beeping)

341
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:43,966
Aw, screw it.

342
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,929
Sometimes a mother's job
is to butt in.

343
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,600
-Lisa?
-Butt out!

344
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,678
(grumbling)

345
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,223
This is it--
I'm going into the Ultranet

346
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,018
to save my daughter.

347
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,191
-(modem feedback)
-(groans)

348
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,238
<i>MALE VOICE (over speaker): Lisa Simpson,</i>
<i>the following people want to friend you.</i>

349
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,213
Ignore. Ignore. Ignore.

350
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,131
Ooh, Martin Prince
is now Marcia Princess?

351
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,550
(giggles)
No, I've got to find Zia.

Now, where is the Google door?

358
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,353
Oh, right.
It's Dr. Seuss's birthday.

359
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,361
Google, even though you've
enslaved half the world,

360
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,031
you're still a damn fine
search engine.

(beeping)

362
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,238
Bingo!

363
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,823
Argh!

364
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,122
(grunting)

365
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,833
I open this door,

366
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,673
and I go from being
one kind of mother to another.

367
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,039
Hmm...

368
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,455
(vehicle whirring)

369
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,713
Dad, where did you take my boys?

370
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,545
-(siren wails)
-Oh, it's Chief Wiggum!

371
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,808
(squealing, whooshing)

372
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,640
-(high-pitched voice): Hi, Bart!
-Hey, Ralph.

373
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,805
-I heard you died.
-I got cloneded.

374
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,354
-(gunshot)
-(gasps)

375
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,897
All right, buddy,
what's the hurry?

376
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,231
(horn blows)

377
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,897
(chuckles)
That Ralph was stupid.

378
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,068
(tires screech)

379
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,405
(panicked yelling)

380
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,326
(vehicle whirring by)

381
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,082
Wow, this place
hasn't changed a bit.

382
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,924
Yeah, I keep meaning
to switch things around,

383
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
but this place
is always a crime scene.

384
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,670
Was my dad here?

385
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,014
Uh, yeah,
since he don't drink,

386
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,589
he just comes here
to see Lenny and Carl.

387
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,255
-Hey, Lenny.
-I'm Carl.

388
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,393
Don't you remember?

389
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,929
You came to the brain-
switching ceremony.

390
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,433
Right. What was the point again?

391
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,595
Because I wanted to get
back together with my wife,

392
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,444
who was sleeping
with Carl at the time.

393
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,399
Turns out she had
switched brains

394
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,479
with a monkey
on a Japanese game show.

395
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,355
And it just got
weirder from there.

396
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,072
Eh, I found it quite normal.

397
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,702
Anyway, if you're
looking for your dad,

398
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,358
he took the kids
to see his dad.

399
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,317
Thanks.

400
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,866
Hey, Moe,
get me another beer?

401
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,369
Quit making me fat!

402
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,695
-(panting)
-I'm glad you're here, Marge.

403
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,287
-They're two minutes apart.
-The contractions?

404
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,883
No, my bills!
(chuckling)

405
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,457
Mm...

406
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,314
(gasps)

407
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,850
ZIA:
Mom? Why are you here?

408
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,438
I was worried.
I thought I would find...

409
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,033
What, me flashing my boobs
on unripemelons.com?

410
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,239
What? No.

411
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,739
It doesn't matter
what I thought.

412
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,360
I'm sorry I spied on you.

413
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,527
But what I found is,
my daughter looks up to me.

414
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,987
Well, of course I do.

415
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,997
I look up to both
my parents.

416
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,209
Could somebody FedEx me
a prayer mat? And quick!

417
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,291
But I especially
look up to you.

418
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,916
Aw...

419
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:11,093
(dance music playing)

420
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,763
This is where my father is.

421
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,473
He froze himself
because he was sick

422
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,176
and there was no cure.

423
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,596
Are they working on one?

424
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,064
Oh, they found it--
but don't tell him.

425
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,364
This is <i>way</i> cheaper
than a nursing home.

426
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,268
(beep)

427
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,606
Aah! What the heck!
(stammers)

428
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,071
Dad, these are
your great-grandsons.

429
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,742
Eh, I don't see
what's great about 'em.

430
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:38,202
And, Homer, you're still a big
disappointment, because...

431
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,083
See you next Christmas!

432
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,410
-(yells)
-(whirring)

433
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,495
Why did you bring us here,
Homer?

434
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,960
To prove a point:

435
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,500
everyone thinks
their dad's a jerk,

436
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,044
and everyone's right,

437
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,838
but when you get older,
you realize how much you love him.

438
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,763
Your dad may be
a little immature,

439
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,432
but I know he loves you.

440
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,760
So you ought
to give him a chance.

441
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,676
(panting)
Oh. Boys...

442
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,224
I have acted like
a ten-year-old

443
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,847
for the last 30 years,

444
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,894
and I swear to you,
I will grow up

445
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,728
and act like a 20-year-old,

446
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,863
the way a divorced
40-year-old should.

447
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,114
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

448
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,735
Boys, I'm a deadbeat dad,
I live in a school,

449
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,123
it's Christmas.

450
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:23,199
The only thing worth anything
in my life is you.

451
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,327
(sobbing)
Oh, Dad.

452
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,456
You've taught us
the meaning of Christmas,

453
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,343
which schools are forbidden
to tell us anymore.

454
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,302
Mmm...

455
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,512
Is it snowing
down here?

456
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,263
No, one of the
freezers is busted.

457
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,184
-(electrical crackling)
-If those kids

458
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,563
can forgive that
train wreck of a father,

459
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,230
then maybe I can forgive...

460
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,309
You quit drinking
like a coward!

461
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,814
The one thing
you were good at, and...

462
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,647
Mm. Oh...
(groans)

463
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,863
...lawn-chair breakin'...

464
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,653

father-freezin'...

468
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,445
but you'd always
come and get me

469
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,826
when I wandered
out on the freeway.

470
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,374
(sobs)
'Cause deep down,

471
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,838
you couldn't bear
to see me smushed.

472
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,130
Oh, I love you, Dad.

473
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,381
<i>(electronic voice)</i>
<i>Ho... ho...</i>

474
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,466
Everyone!

475
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,351
It's a girl!

476
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,814
So, who's the father?

477
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,524
Eh, it doesn't matter.

478
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,850
If there's one day a year
to give unwed mothers a break,

479
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,147
it's Christmas.

480
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,318
Okay, everyone,

481
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,989
smile while the pets
take our picture.

482
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,909
Hmm, funny how <i>they</i>
evolved and we didn't.

483
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,751
Shh!
