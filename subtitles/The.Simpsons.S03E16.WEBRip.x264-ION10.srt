What's the matter
with you guys?

26
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,591
Homer, last year
we were two and 28.

27
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:35,295
-Look, I know it wasn't our best season.
-Actually, it was.

28
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,546
Well, this year,
it's gonna be different.

29
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,718
Oh yeah? What makes you
so damn sure?

30
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,977
I have a secret weapon.

31
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,060
Hey, he's been
holding out on us, huh?

32
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,645
A secret weapon?

33
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,440
I wonder what it could be.

00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,374

Come here, boy,
I want to show you something.

38
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,375
What's that?
A homemade bat?

39
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,089
It's something very special--

40
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,879
a homemade bat.

41
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,803

You can't leave first
until you chug a beer.

64

Any man scoring
has to chug a beer.

65
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,495
You have to chug a beer at the
top of all odd-numbered innings.

66
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,672
Oh, and the fourth inning
is the beer inning.

to play softball.

to hit the ball too.

And he does.

75
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,939
And there he goes off
in that direction.

76
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,268
And everyone is happy.

77
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,063
Uh, Mom, why don't you
let me call the game?

78
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,567

a magic bat too.

100

No. I want
to get him a beer.

Kids, kids, kids,

102
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,462
you can each
get me a beer,

103
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:00,046

{\an8}Huh?

Ooh!

108
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,237
Such a mighty wallop.

109
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,464
I got my magic bat
off a piano.

110
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,920
My sister let me use
her wooden leg.

111
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,551
SMITHERS:
Good news, sir.

112
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,224
The plant softball team
has won again.

113
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,803
If we beat Shelbyville
next week,

114
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,928
we capture
the pennant.

115
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,314

116
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,890
My boys need only to
thump your tub,

117
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,305
and the title is ours.

118
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,313
Ha! The Gladiators
from my power plant

119
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:58,516
will crush your team
like nine flabby grapes.

120
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,188
I disagree.

121
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,776
Would you care to bet
a million dollars on that?

122
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,862
Oh, if we're going to bet,
why don't we make it interesting?

123
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,117
What. A million dollars
isn't interesting to you?

124
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,450
Oh, did you say a million?

125
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,124
I'm sorry.
My mind was elsewhere.

126
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,123
I thought you would start
with a small amount,

127
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,705
and we would
bait each other, and...

128
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,750
Well, you know
how it goes.

129
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,292
Yes, certainly.
A million will be fine.

130
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,377
Smithers, I've been
thinking.

131
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,384
Is it wrong to cheat in order
to win a million dollar bet?

132
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,387
Yes, sir.

133
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,348
Let me rephrase that.

134
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:30,468
Is it wrong if <i>I</i> cheat in order
to win a million dollar bet?

135
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,676
No, sir.
Who would you like killed?

136
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:36,557
No, Smithers. I've decided
to bring in a few ringers--

137
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,646
professional baseballers.

138
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,191
We'll give them
token jobs at the plant

139
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,485
and have them play
on our softball team.

140
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,069
Honus Wagner, Cap Anson,

141
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,414
Mordecai
"Three Finger" Brown...

142
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,779
Uh, sir?

143
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,365
What is it, Smithers?

144
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,540
I'm afraid all those
players have retired

145
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,079
and, uh, passed on.

146
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:57,213
In fact, your right fielder
has been dead for 130 years.

147
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,631
Damnation!

148
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,549
Alright, find me
some good players.

149
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,088
Living players.

150
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,421
Scour the
professional ranks,

151
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,716
the American League,
the National League,

152
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,140
the negro leagues.

153
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,048
I'm on my way, sir.

154
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,386
Oh, and, Smithers..

155
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,810
You have 24 hours.

156
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,059
(gulps)

157
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,265
(whispering)

158
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,983
I get $50,000
to play one game?

159
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,694
That's right,
Mr. Canseco.

160
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,484
Well, it's a pay cut,
but what the hey.

161
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,738
It sounds like fun.

162
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,409
Uh... oh... ah...

163
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,658
-(gunshot)
-Hey, sorry. I thought you were a deer.

164
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,121
Oh, that's okay.
Happens all the time.

165
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,832
Are you Mike Scioscia?

166
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,162
-That's me.
-Uh...

167
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,037
How do you like working
for the Dodgers?

168
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,544
Well, it's okay,
but sometimes

169
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,546
I wish I had something
a little more blue collar.

170
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,338
You know, with big machines
and cool dials and stuff,

171
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,843
like an oil refinery

172
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,094
or hydroelectric plant.

173
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,546
We should talk.

174
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,255
TOUR GUIDE:
And this is Elvis' rec room.

175
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,886
When the king wasn't
rehearsing or exercising,

176
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,314
he'd like to unwind by watching
up to three TVs at once.

177
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,734
Man, oh, man,
what a lifestyle.

178
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,113
Excuse me.
Are you Ozzie Smith?

179
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,530
-Yes.
-I have a proposition for you.

180
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,026
Ahem. Hello.
Are you Don Mattingly?

181
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,323
Yes, yes, I am.

182
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,986
Come in. Come in.
Can I get you something?

183
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,284
What's your name?

184
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,464
How would you
like to be a ringer

185
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,919
on a small-town
company softball team?

186
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,130
Would I?

187
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,751
And now I'd like
to introduce the new members

188
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,507
of our happy
power plant family.

189
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,669
-Our new security guard, Roger Clemens.
-Hello.

190
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,178
-Our new janitor, Wade Boggs.
-How you doing?

191
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,140
Our lunchroom cashier,
Ken Griffey Jr.

192
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,511
Hey, what's up, guys?

193
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,137
Our new, well, uh...

194
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,894
we'll make up jobs
for these fellas later.

195
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:41,095
Please say hello to Steve Sax,
Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry,

196
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,107
Ozzie Smith, Mike Scioscia,
and Jose Canseco.

197
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,860
(impressed murmuring)

198
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,072
Oh, by the way,
you new fellas,

199
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,612
there's a sign-up sheet
for the company

200
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,655
softball team on the
bulletin board over there,

201
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,449
just in case you
wish to play.

202
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,413
(angry grumbling)

203
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,663
Mr. Burns, with them
on the team, you won't need us.

204
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:58,905
Well, duh.

205
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,406
You, Scioscia, sign up.

206
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,078
Thanks just the same,
but I'm here to run

207
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,746
the solid contaminate
encapsulator.

208
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,044
One more outburst like that

209
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,337
and I'll send you back
to the big leagues.

210
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,261
-You're Darryl Strawberry.
-Yes.

211
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,012
-You play right field.
-Yes.

212
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,934
-I play right field too.
-So?

213
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,102
Well, are you
better than me?

214
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,350
Well, I never met you,
but... yes.

215
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,353
It's not fair. Me and the guys
worked so hard to get

216
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:25,266
to the championship game,
and now we'll be sitting on the bench.

217
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,566
You hit so many
home runs this year.

218
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,490
What makes you think this
Darryl Strawberry character

219
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,699
is better than you?

220
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,358
Marge, forget it.

221
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,116
He's bigger than me, faster than me,
stronger than me,

222
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,739
and he already has more friends
around the plant than I do.

223
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,787
You make me sick, Homer.

224
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,870
You're the one who told me
I could do anything

225
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,706
if I just
put my mind to it.

226
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,501
Well, now that you're a
little bit older,

227
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,125
I can tell you that's a crock.

228
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,751
No matter how good
you are at something,

229
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,298
there's always about
a million people better than you.

230
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,302
Gotcha--
Can't win, don't try.

231
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,604
As your new manager,
I want to say this up front.

232
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,889
No one is assured a spot
in the starting line-up.

233
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,773
I don't care
if you're name is Steve Sax

234
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,310
or Darryl Strawberry, or...

235
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,983
Smithers, what's one of
the bad players names?

236
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,481
Homer Simpson, sir.

237
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,983
Or Homer Simpson.

238
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,614
Secondly, instead of beer,

239
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,651
from now on, you will
all be drinking this.

240
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,355
It's a brain and nerve tonic

241
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,905
rich in proteins
and electromagnetic juices.

242
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,739
It promotes robust health.

243
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,494
Of course it has been known
to cause gigantism,

244
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,986
but only in rare cases.

245
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,617
Try some.

246
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,464
Wow. It's like there's
a party in my mouth

247
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,540
and everyone's invited.

248
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,035
Excellent.

249
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,876
Now, let's begin
our training, shall we?

250
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,631
Smithers...

251
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,133
the medicine balls.

252
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,384
(players groaning)

253
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,428
Ugh... Ugh...

254
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,602
Here.

255
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,110
(chuckles)

256
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,903
What are you gonna do
with your million dollars, sir?

257
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,066
Oh, I don't know.
Throw it in the pile, I suppose.

258
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,405
You are all very good players.

259
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,412
ALL:
We are all very good players.

260
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,794
You will beat Shelbyville.

261
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,921
We will beat Shelbyville.

262
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,088
You will give 110%.

263
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,338
That's impossible.

264
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,669
No one can give
more than 100%.

265
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,426
By definition, that is
the most anyone can give.

266
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,640
(ball being hit)

267
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,099
I got it!
I got it!

268
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,852
-(ball hits mitt)
-Yes.

269
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,024
Hey!

270
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,232
I called for that.

271
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,311
Put a lid on it. Simpson!

272
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,436
There's no "I" in "team."

273
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,573
Some of these guys
have a bad attitude, Skip.

274
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,490
They sure do,
Strawberry.

275
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,909
(whistling "Take Me Out
to the Ball Game")

276
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,988
Hey, Scioscia,
I don't get it.

277
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,374
You're a ringer, but you're here
every night in the core

278
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,621
busting your butt
hauling radioactive waste.

279
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,794
Well, Carl, it's such a relief
from the pressures

280
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,502
of playing big league ball.

281
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,712
I mean there, you make
any kind of mistake, and boom,

282
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,963
the press is all over you.

283
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,955
-Uh-oh.
-Ah, don't worry about it.

284
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,677
Oh, man,
is this ever sweet.

285
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,968
-Me, me.
-Pick me.

286
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,392
Pick me, pick me.

287
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,010
I pick Ken Griffey Jr.

288
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,387
Aw, geez.

289
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,853
Okay, I'll take Milhouse.

290
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,145
Hey Mr. Boggs, will
you be on my team?

291
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,559
You got yourself a player.

292
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,647
Damn!

293
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,072
All right,
I'll take Louis.

294
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,571
I'll take Jose Canseco.

295
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:17,742
D'oh!

296
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,911
Mattingly, get rid
of those sideburns.

297
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,410
-What sideburns?
-You heard me, hippie.

298
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:27,542
These guys aren't so tough.
I've got Wonderbat.

299
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,291
(theme from
"The Natural" plays)

300
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,416
(screams)

301
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,547
Take a knee, boys.

302
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,758
Tomorrow is the biggest day
of your lives.

303
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,300
The Shelbyville game.

304
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,053
So lights out at 7:30,

305
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,215
and abstain from coffee,
tea, and cola drinks.

306
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,224
Make no mistake,
they pack a wallop.

307
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,466
Sure do, Skip.

308
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,727
Yes. Now, before I post
the starting lineup,

309
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,649
I want to assure those of you
whose names are not on the list

310
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,059
that I'm very
disappointed in you.

311
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,318
Something was lacking.
Let's call it heart.

312
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,281
-No hustle either, Skip.
-That's right, Darryl.

313
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,993
-All right.
-Way to go.

314
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,414
Aw, nuts.

315
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,123
Please, please, please.
I want to make the team.

316
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,663
Clemens,
did I make the team?

317
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,826
You sure did.

318
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,254
I did?!
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

319
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,833
In your face, Strawberry.

320
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,298
-Wait a minute, are you Ken Griffey Jr.?
-No.

321
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,088
Sorry, didn't mean
to get your hopes up.

322
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,842
Oh...

323
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,769
(Burns chuckling)

324
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,060
Smithers, there's no way
I can lose this bet,

325
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,055
unless, of course,
my nine all-stars

326
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,317
fall victim to nine
separate misfortunes,

327
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,069
and are unable
to play tomorrow,

328
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,991
but that will never happen.

329
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,530
Three misfortunes,
that's possible.

330
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,413
Seven misfortunes,
there's an outside chance.

331
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,121
But nine misfortunes?
I'd like to see that.

332
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,793
SAX:
What a nice little town.

333
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,462
Maybe I'll buy a home here
when I retire.

334
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,001
(siren blaring)

335
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,166
What seems to be
the problem, officers?

336
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,295
That's enough out of you,
smart guy.

337
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,721
Reach for your license.

338
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,009
(cocks gun)
Slowly.

339
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,433
Well, well. Steve Sax,
from New York City.

340
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,773
I heard some guy
got killed in New York City,

341
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,559
and they never
solved the case,

342
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,272
but you wouldn't know
anything about that,

343
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,442
now, would you, Steve?

344
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,482
{\an8}But there's hundreds
of unsolved murders

345
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,015
{\an8}in New York City.

346
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,108
You don't know when
to keep your mouth shut,

347
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,653
do you, Saxy boy?

348
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,986
(ticking)

349
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,121
(ticking increases)

350
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,989
Uh, Mike,
try to lift your arm.

351
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,867
Can't... lift... arm...

352
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,035
or... speak...

353
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,133
at... normal... rate.

354
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,539
Well, I'm afraid
you have a case

355
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,047
of acute radiation poisoning,
Mr. Scioscia.

356
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,380
Will... I...

357
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,634
be... able...

358
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,006
to... play...

359
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,142
softball... tomorrow?

360
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,889
(chuckling)

361
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,431
No, by tomorrow, you'll
barely be able to breathe.

362
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,265
Oh... man.

363
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:57,901
Dr. Hibbert, Ken Griffey Jr.
needs to see you immediately.

364
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,480
We think it's an overdose
of nerve tonic.

365
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,572
Good Lord!

366
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,321
Gigantism!

367
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,494
(whistling)

368
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,032
-(baby crying)
-My baby! My baby!

369
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,735
Don't worry, ma'am.
I'll save your baby.

370
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,423
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Canseco.

371
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,248
-(cat meows)
-My cat!

372
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,674
Never fear, ma'am.
I'll save your cat.

373
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,176
-(piano playing)
-(gasps) My player piano!

374
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,140
Oh, man.

375
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,734
Ohh, one thing I'm good at,
and I can't do it anymore.

376
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,060
Homie, you're good
at lots of things.

377
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,896
Like what?

378
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,321
Like snuggling.

379
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,859
Yeah, but none of my friends
can watch me.

380
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,994
Hmm.

381
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,910
BARNEY:
And I say

382
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,618
England's greatest
prime minister

383
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,659
was Lord Palmerston!

384
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:53,953
Pitt, the Elder.

385
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,076
Lord Palmerston!

386
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,333
Pitt, the Elder!

387
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,705
Okay, you asked
for it, Boggs.

388
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,843
Uh!

389
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,879
Yeah, that's
showing him, Barney.

390
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:04,923
Pitt, the Elder.

391
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:08,425
Lord Palmerston!

392
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,219
Nice work, boys.

393
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,642
I think we can close the book
on just about every unsolved crime

394
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,101
in our fair city.

395
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,771
Don't I at least get
to call my lawyer?

396
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,139
You watch
too many movies, Sax.

397
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,647
(door slams)

398
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,398
{\an8}How long does it take
to see this thing?

399
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,521
I'm kind of in a hurry.

400
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,067
Well it's hard to say,
my friend.

401
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,990
Once you go in,
you may never come out.

402
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,820
Wow! One, please.

403
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,909
(Smith screaming)

404
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,163
(screaming fades)

405
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,294
(man chuckles)

406
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,832
Where do you think
you're going?

407
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,206
-To the game.
-No, no, no.

408
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,803
I don't want you to see me
sitting on my worthless butt.

409
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,009
We've seen it, Dad.

410
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,465
Mattingly, for the last time,
get rid of those sideburns.

411
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,763
Look Mr. Burns, I don't know
what you think sideburns are, but--

412
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,848
Don't argue with me!
Just get rid of them!

413
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,768
Smithers, it's almost
game time.

414
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,483
Where the devil
are my ringers?

415
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,613
Sir, Mike Scioscia may not
live through the night.

416
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,940
Steve Sax is looking at
six consecutive life sentences,

417
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,647
and Ozzie Smith seems to have
vanished off the face of the Earth.

418
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,108
(screaming)

419
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,407
Cool!

420
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,370
(screaming)

421
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,830
Well, what
about Canseco?

422
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,455
The dryer goes
on the right.

423
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,669
Yes, ma'am.

424
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,000
What about Clemens?

425
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,304
Sir, he's in
no condition to play.

426
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,298
(clucking like a chicken)

427
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,011
That damn hypnotist!

428
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,931
You! Look what you've done.

429
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,390
My starting pitcher
thinks he's a chicken.

430
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,141
Make no mistake,
I'm going to report this

431
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,062
to the American
Hypnotical Association.

432
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,731
But I did a good job...

433
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,060
a good job...

434
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,146
Oh well, I guess it's
not your fault.

435
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,361
You did a good job.

436
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,691
(gasps)
Mattingly!

437
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,197
I thought I told you
to trim those sideburns!

438
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,989
Go home!
You're off the team!

439
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,203
-For good!
-Fine.

440
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,203
I still like him better
than Steinbrenner.

441
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,825
Ahem. All right, you ragtag
bunch of misfits.

442
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,503
You hate me
and I hate you even more,

443
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,292
but without my beloved ringers,

444
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,085
you're all I've got.

445
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,669
So I... want you
to remember

446
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,045
some inspiring things

447
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,841
that someone else
may have told you

448
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,425
in the course of your lives,

449
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,140
and go out there and win.

450
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,180
(cheering)

451
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,182
(sniffs)

452
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,063
Not so fast, Simpson.

453
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,980
The man who plays
your position is still here.

454
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,725
-Hit the pine.
-Ohh!

455
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,028
You stink, Strawberry!

456
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,689
We want home-run Homer!

457
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,568
(taunting)
Darryl.

458
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,905
Darryl.

459
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,700
-Darryl. Darryl.
-Darryl. Darryl.

460
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,825
Children, that's
not very nice.

461
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,412
Mom, they're
professional athletes.

462
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,117
They're used to
this sort of thing.

463
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,997
It rolls
right off their backs.

464
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,174
(sniffs)

465
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,915
-Who wants peanuts? I got peanuts!
-Over here!

466
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,836
Hey, wha, ho,
peanuts taste good!

467
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,885
Hey, peanuts!
We got peanuts!

468
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:57,969
Need some peanuts?
Heads up!

469
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,143
All right, Monty,

470
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,271
it's up to your
managerial skills.

471
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,678
What to do--

472
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:03,976
Smithers, massage my brain.

473
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,059
Yes, sir.

474
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,942
BURNS: You, Strawberry!
Hit a home run!

475
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,444
Okay, Skip.

476
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,696
Ha ha ha!
I told him to do that.

477
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,832
Brilliant strategy, sir.

478
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,543
Ohh!

479
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,081
MARGE:
Oh, dear!

480
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,115
Hmm.

481
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,577
Children, tell me

482
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,417
when your father stops
scratching himself.

483
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,165
Kids?

484
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,756
We'll tell you, mom.

485
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,721
BURNS:
All right, tie game.

486
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,971
Bottom of the ninth.

487
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,513
Two outs, bases loaded.

488
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,137
Strawberry coming up.

489
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,393
<i>They're going to win</i>
<i>the city championship.</i>

490
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,055
<i>No thanks to me.</i>

491
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,015
Wait.
You! Strawberry!

492
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,515
Good effort today.

493
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,187
Take a lap
and hit the showers.

494
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,025
I'm putting in a right-handed batter
to hit for you.

495
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,780
-What?
-You're pinch-hitting for me?!

496
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,572
Yes. You see
you're a left-hander,

497
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,866
and so is the pitcher.

498
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,279
If I send up a
right-handed batter,

499
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,197
it's called
playing the percentages.

500
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,536
It's what smart managers do
to win ball games.

501
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,462
But I've got
nine home runs today.

502
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,540
You should be very proud of yourself.
Sit down.

503
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,376
Simpson!
You're batting for Strawberry.

504
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,131
I am? Whoo-hoo!

505
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,343
That a boy, Homer.

506
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,382
-You can do it.
-(clucking)

507
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,046
All right, Simpson.
Let's go over the signals.

508
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,045
If I tug the bill
of my cap like so...

509
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,217
Yeah?

510
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,215
...it means the signal
is a fake.

511
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,806
Uh-huh.

512
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,941
However, I can take that off
by dusting my hands thusly.

513
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,188
-Got it.
-If I want you to bunt,

514
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,689
I will touch my belt buckle

515
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,651
not once, not twice,
but thrice.

516
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,241
<i>Uh oh. I don't understand</i>
<i>a word he's saying.</i>

517
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,108
<i>Why doesn't he</i>
<i>just let me bat?</i>

518
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,485
<i>I wish I was home</i>

519
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,701
<i>with a big bag</i>
<i>of potato chips.</i>

520
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:46,083
<i>Mmm... potato chips.</i>

521
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,081
-Got that, Simpson?
-Yes, sir.

522
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:52,753
<i>Now batting for Darryl Strawberry--</i>
<i>Homer Simpson.</i>

523
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,134
-All right!
-Yay!

524
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,381
(crowd booing)

525
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,882
(theme from
"The Natural" plays)

526
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,011
Huh?

527
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,097
Oof!
