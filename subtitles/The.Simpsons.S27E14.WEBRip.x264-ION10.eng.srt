(exclaims) Lisa?

171
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,430
Just what do you think you're up to?

172
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,678
Mm...

173
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,849
Come on.
You can tell Dr. Tuna.

174
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,098
Okay, I admit it.
I think Bart's up to something funny,

175
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,100
so I'm snooping in his room.

176
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,602
No snooping.
You know what they say about curiosity.

177
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,595
-It killed the cat?
-The cat's fine!

178
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,937
Stop asking about the cat!

179
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,533
MAN:
Lose a Kewpie doll in front of your gal.

180
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,029
(tuning guitar)

181
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,610
{\an8}-Hey, boss.
-(clears throat)

182
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,448
{\an8}We have a situation here.

183
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,873
{\an8}You owe me
three weeks' back rent.

184
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,252
{\an8}Aha!

185
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,288
Bart Simpson, you are cruelly exploiting

186
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,712
a poor, unfortunate woman.

187
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,961
So, you're gonna tell Mom
and she's gonna kick Hettie out.

188
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,554
Girlie, ain't you got a heart?

189
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,379
Nope. All brain, no heart.

190
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,215
Yeah. She looks
like a little bitty railroad bull.

191
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,762
Now I got to sing for my supper.

192
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,885
I wrote this one a few days ago.

193
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,482
This is a song about loss.

194
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,559
<i>♪ It was a cart ♪</i>

195
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:04,726

196
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:08,027

208

Whoa!
My roommate is talented!

209
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,133
If I know my Smithsonian Folkways,

210
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,375
that was an Appalachian folk song.

211
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,387
Well, I'm from Lickskillet, Kentucky,

212
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,299
just shy of the Appalachia Trail.

213
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,718
Really? Oh, I love, love, love
indigenous mountain music.

214
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,558
-(chuckles)
-Well, isn't that fascinatin'?

215
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,484
I'm glad you liked the song.

216
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,234
Yes.
I liked it very, very, very m...

217
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,396
Oh! You want money.

218
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,895
I'm sorry. I don't have any.
(chuckles)

219
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,318
I'm also a musician.

220
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,027
(chuckles)
But you can stay in our house.

221
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,698
Ha-ha! It's a deal!
Back in the boy's closet.

222
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,207
No, Hettie.
You're a human being.

223
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,289
You can sleep in <i>my</i> closet.

224
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,424
Hmm. Well, la-di-da.

225
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,881
How much you charge?

226
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,211
Nothing.
Maybe we can talk a little music.

227
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,717
Ugh.
Boy, what's your price again?

228
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,219
Okay, we'll only talk about it
if you want to!

229
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,472
But it would be an honor.

230
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,723
Okay, let's go.

231
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,184
Oh, you've hurt yourself.

232
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,724
Uh, nope, that's syrup.

233
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,347
Oh, let me find you a Wet-Nap.

234
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,064
I just woke up from a wet nap.

235
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,154
Okay. Conversation's over.

236
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,899
LISA: Check, one, two.

237
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,981
All right...
No, no, no, leave the windows open.

238
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,316
I like crickets and night breeze
in my music.

239
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,032
They do go well together.
Have you always been musical?

240
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,033
You know, first sound I ever
heard was my daddy fiddlin'.

241
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,576
His name was Bascom Lee Boggs.

242
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,370
(gasps)
Bascom Lee Boggs?!

243
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,874
He played with
some seminal Appalachian bands,

244
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,706
like Snug and the Cousin Huggers,

245
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,751
Lead Paint Larry and the Drooly Boys,

246
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,205
Howlin' Sue and Her Vestigial Organ,

247
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,336
and Bloody Mary
and the Coalmine Canaries.

248
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,513
(inhales)
Did your daddy teach you to fiddle?

249
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,512
No.

250
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,763
He was gonna start me out
on the cigar box "banjer,"

251
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,845
but, uh, 'fore he could,
he-he lost his sight.

252
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,391
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

253
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,595
Yeah, he got shot in the face.

254
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,515
(gasps)

255
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,403
You know them puzzles
where you slide the tiles?

256
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,110
He looks a little like that now.

257
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,940
My mother was an amazing
"banjer" player. Mmm.

258
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:55,526
-Unfortunately, she did also go blind.
-Really?

259
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,993
Yeah, it was winter
and she was runnin' a fever

260
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,794
and, um, then she got shot
in the face.

261
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,998
Oh, wow.
Hettie, you've had such a sad life.

262
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,250
But you know what?
That's gonna turn around

263
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,792
when I show the world
what it's missing in you.

264
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,626
Well, I don't know
if the world's gonna get me,

265
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,262
but, child, it sure feels
good to know that you do.

266
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,720
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

267
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,010
You're having a moment
with someone

268
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,763
who has so few moments.

269
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,814
This will never be forgotten.

270
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:25,478
Oh, baby girl, I feel like
I'm back home in poorest Appalachia.

271
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,139
Thank you.

272
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:31,148
Okay. And three, two, one...

273
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,612

It's lovely, but I want you to know

282
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,889
I've-I've truly come to hate music.

283
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,517
That is so sad.

284
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,983
I wanted to arrange a concert
in Springfield Park.

285
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,734
We needed the school's lights
and sound system.

286
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,317
Lights? Sweetie, you don't know
a Fresnel from a gobo.

287
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,744
Well, I think you'll help me
every way you can.

288
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,373
And why, pray tell, is that?

289
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,830
Because deep down,
there's still a part of you

290
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,370
that remembers music can be magical.

291
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,035
(chuckles)
You're right.

292
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,173
I can't bear to kill your passion.

293
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,500
It will live at least until third grade,

294
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,086
when you get Mrs. Ortner.

295
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,592
So, I got back together with Jeff.

296
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,344
Then, of course, I realized
there was a reason we broke up.

297
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,887
(playing tuba)

298
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,020
That sounds awful,
and you look stupid doing it.

299
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,228
(guitar playing)

300
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,954
(grumbling)

301
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,578
(knocking)

302
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,910
Hettie, Hettie,
I have a surprise for you!

303
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:12,076
(gasps)
Oh, well, barbecue my bedbugs.

304
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,076
That is glorious.

305
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:17,378
(chuckles)
To pay for it, I sold my Malibu Stacys.

306
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,933
Which, from a feminist perspective,
was long overdue.

307
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:24,428
But I have a Ken
that I'm transitioning to a Stacy.

308
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,892
Try it on, try it on, try it on!

309
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,021
I heard you the second time!

310
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,603
Mmm, mmm.
Why, thank you, Your Majesty,

311
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,515
I will have another cup of soda.

312
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,984
-Lis, Lis, Lis.
-(grunting) What?!

313
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,395
I've seen you like this before,
and it ends badly.

314
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,074
She is gonna break your heart.

315
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,072
And your heart's as tough
as a soap bubble.

316
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,624
Remember how upset you got
over that dead plant?

317
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,238
Oh. It's the seven-month
anniversary of that.

318
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,736
(crying)

319
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,408
Oh, geez, here we go again.

320
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,826
Ugh. You know what, Bart?
Just get out!

321
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,245
And get Dad's keys
and drive us to the radio station.

322
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,254
And then get out!
Wait until we're done.

323
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,376
Then drive us back.
Then get out!

324
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,424
(hammering, sawing)

325
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,968
-(crash)
-HOMER: Damn it!

326
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,971
-(knocking)
-(footsteps approaching)

327
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,813
Hey.

328
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,098
Hello, Homer.
I need to do the laundry.

329
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,892
-Uh, uh, I'll do it!
-Oh.

330
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,767
<i>HOMER: You idiot.</i>
<i>Now we'll always have to do the laundry!</i>

331
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,435
(laughs)

332
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,783
I'll do it wrong
so she'll never ask again.

333
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,939
<i>Homer, you're a genius!</i>

334
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,647
Thanks, brain!

335
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,947
<i>Oh, I'm not your brain.</i>
<i>I'm a blood clot.</i>

336
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,037
Okay. I'm goin' in.

337
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,539
Thank God I never put in
that insulation.

338
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,417
(grunting)

339
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,168
Whoo-hoo!

340
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,974

I'm here today with the one and only
Miss Hettie Mae Boggs,

00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,881
the baby of the Boggs Family.

Well, I'm a little big for a baby.

Although my mother did have a 21-pounder.

361
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,351
Charming.
Does anyone on this station talk

like they're <i>not</i> at a funeral?

363
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,100
No. I'm afraid we all do.

So, Hettie,
you're doing a concert tonight.

365
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,767
Yes, she is.

366
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,562
Could you tell our listeners
why you didn't perform

367
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,396
with your older brothers and sisters?

368
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,231
I mean, they would ask me to.
They would...

369
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,686
They'd say,
"Hettie, come over here,

370
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,946
pick up a banjo
and play a song with us."

371
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,358
And, um, I don't know.

372
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,866
I'd say, "No, I'm happy
just to sit down by the creek

373
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,079
and do my heroin."
You know?

Wait. What?

375
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,374
Is it also true you've been discovered by,

376
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,874
and then turned your back on,

377
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,076
well-meaning supporters
time and time again?

378
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,206
Uh, yes, yeah,
that is a pattern I adhere to,

379
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,633
and do you have any OxyContin?

380
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,302
Now, if you got some, you don't
have to say yes. You just got to blink.

381
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,972
Maybe we should take a break.

382
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,050
For the record, I'm not blinking.

No, no, Hettie,
please tell me that you're rehabilitated.

385
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,481
Please tell me
that you're talking about heroin

386
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,899
so that no one else
will follow in your footsteps.

387
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,729
Please reassure me
because I am frightened.

388
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,065
Oh, baby girl,
I wouldn't let you down.

389

You and me--
we get each other, yeah?

Are you saying that you shot
your parents in the face?

I don't know.

394
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,660
That's not really

All right, I'm gonna go now. Bye.

You're out of your mind.

405
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,273
So, how'd it go

without our permission.

00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,812
Well, now I don't know where she is,
