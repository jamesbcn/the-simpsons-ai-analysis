00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,750

6
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:18,885
-D-oh!
-(groans)

7
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:20,728
(screams)

8
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,268
-(honking horn)
-(screaming)

9
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,364
I don't get it.
They should be here by now.

10
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,453
Ah, what're you gonna do?

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,670
{\an8}Hmm. Good lines, nice balance.

12
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,966
{\an8}Let's see how she handles.

13
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,013
{\an8}Ho-ho, oh, yeah.

14
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,135
{\an8}Tame it, baby.

15
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,772
{\an8}Yo, ring her up, dude.

16
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,269
{\an8}-(register dings)
-(gasps)

17
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,770
{\an8}You cannot smoke in here.

18
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,692
{\an8}Please, the sign is clearly posted, sir.

19
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,149
{\an8}(coughing)

20
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,403
{\an8}Oh, god. You smokers disgust me.

21
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,106
{\an8}Hey, 'pu, you got a breakfast cereal

22
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,776
{\an8}for people with syphilis?

23
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,275
{\an8}-(cocks gun)
-Hands up, scuzzbag.

24
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,907
{\an8}No, not you, the smoking scuzzbag.

25
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,619
{\an8}Ho-ho, chill out, dude.
I'll pay the fine.

26
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,957
{\an8}Not this time, you won't.
This is your third strike.

27
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,554
{\an8}First you torched that orphanage,

28
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,589
{\an8}then you blew up that bus full of nuns...

29
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,672
{\an8}Hey, that was self-defense.

30
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,678
{\an8}Well, you'll be seeing lotsa nuns

31
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,140
{\an8}where you're going, pal...

32
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,260
{\an8}Hell!

33
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,466
{\an8}Because the penalty
for strike three is death.

34
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,564
{\an8}Ho, you'll never make it stick, dude.

35
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,564
{\an8}Will, too, 'cause this place
is full of witnesses.

36
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,357
{\an8}Apu, that scuzzbag Moe...

37
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,781
{\an8}I'm not going to

38
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,359
{\an8}-forget this, dudes.
-Oh.

39
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,114
{\an8}I'm going to totally kill both of you.

40
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,946
{\an8}And, uh, don't forget Bart Simpson.

41
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,203
{\an8}He's a witness, too.

42
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,374
{\an8}-Right, Barty?
-Oh.

43
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,252
{\an8}Oh, you are so dead, little dude.

44
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,750
{\an8}Thanks a lot, Chief.

45
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,252
(laughing) You kids crack me up.

46
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,170
Hi, I'm Ed McMahon.

47
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,764
Tonight on Fox,

48
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:16,089
from the producers of <i>When Skirts Fall Off</i>
<i>and Secrets of National Security Revealed,</i>

49
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,757
it's <i>World's Deadliest Executions.</i>

50
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,217
(crowd cheering)

51
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,016
Making his first appearance on our show,

52
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,890
(dramatically) here's Snake!

53
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,058
{\an8}(crowd booing)

54
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,107
{\an8}(crowd heckling)

55
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,566
{\an8}Thank you, chickie pies.

56
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,863
{\an8}The chair? Oh...

57
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,907
{\an8}How come they only do
crucifixions during sweeps?

58
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:43,202
ED: Snake played lacrosse
at Ball State University.

59
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,618
So long, Snake.

60
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,206
You'll never harm another person

61
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,921
with secondhand smoke.

62
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,751
-(electricity crackling)
-(groaning)

63
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,127
(all coughing)

64
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,384
(groaning)

65
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,046
Dude...

66
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,602
{\an8}-Hey-oh!
-(crowd applauding)

67
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,102
(crowd cheering)

68
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,024
All right. Now, let's get this carcass

69
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,232
over to the hospital
and carve it up for organs.

70
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,813
Dibs on the liver!

71
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,478
(phone ringing)

72
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,525
Whoo-hoo!

73
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,900
Marge, they found a donor.

74
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,237
I'm saved.

75
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,281
Boy, you're getting this transplant

76
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,197
just in time, Homer.

77
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,786
This is genuine human hair.

78
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,502
This is legal, right?

79
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,208
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

80
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,503
These drugs will make the operation

81
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,797
seem like a beautiful dream.

82
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,259
(groans)

83
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,472
Aah...

84
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,472
Hi, everybody!

85
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,305
(humming)

86
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:53,515
Who wants to see their sexy new daddy?

87
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,242
-(gasping)
-LISA: Oh, Dad!

88
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,781
Wow! If your fly weren't open,

89
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,985
you'd look just like Roger Moore.

90
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,661
(owl hooting)

91
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,754
-(Marge snoring)
-(groans)

92
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,958
(muttering)

93
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,755
(Snake's voice)
Later, chickie pie.

94
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,186
Ooh!

95
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,019
Ooh-la-la, Simpson.

96
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,944
Huh! What can I do
for you and your new do?

97
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,863
(Snake's voice)
You sent me to the chair.

98
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,533
(gasps) Snake?

99
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,238
But you're dead.

100
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,281
I know you are, but what am I?

101
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:45,787
No! No!

102
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,038
No!

103
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,411
(Apu's scream echoing)

104
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:53,584
<i>And the fluffy kitten</i>
<i>played with that ball of string</i>

105
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,458
<i>all through the night.</i>

106
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,165
<i>On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk</i>

107
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,545
<i>was brutally murdered last night.</i>

108
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,971
-(gasping)
-(normal voice) Oh, God.

109
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,179
-Oh, man.
-I can't believe it.

110
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,509
-LISA: Geez.
-That's horrible.

111
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,853
Who'll run the Kwik-E-Mart?

112
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,468
(slurping)

113
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,216
I'm afraid we have no leads,

114
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,138
but I can safely say Apu did not suffer.

115
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,267
(Lou crunching)

116
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,063
Looks to me like
he suffered a lot, Chief.

117
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,817
Aw, geez, Lou.

118
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:16,858
How long were you going to let me

119
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,361
keep drinking this thing?

120
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,783
(slurping)

121
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,283
Who would do such a thing?

122
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,922
-Ah, morning, Homer.
-(door bangs shut)

123
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,632
You're looking
unusually focused this morning.

124
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,343
(Snake's voice)
Shut your squeal-hole,

125
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,343
booze jockey.

126
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,804
I'm going to, like, totally waste you.

127
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,965
Well, somebody's a grumpy Gus.

128
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,098
MOE: What's-- Oh!

129
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,311
(corkscrew squeaking)

130
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,391
(chuckles) Yoink.

131
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,307
Ah, for crying out loud.

132
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,645
(groans)

133
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,531
<i>Another of Springfield's</i>
<i>beloved citizens</i>

134
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,189
<i>was murdered today.</i>

135
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,527
<i>Filthy old Bartender Moe Szyslak</i>

136
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,573

00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,906
-(turns off TV)
-Oh, my God.

138
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,201
Everyone Snake swore revenge on
is being murdered!

139
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,615
It's almost like he's killing
from beyond the grave.

140
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,254
I told you capital punishment
isn't a deterrent.

141
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,672
Don't you get it?

142
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,040
He swore he'd kill me, too. I'm next!

143
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,837
(normal voice) Don't worry.
I'll protect you...

144
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,384
(Snake's voice) ...little dude.

145
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:30,221
(normal voice) There.
Now no murderers can get in.

146
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,688
-(Snake's voice) Or out.
-Dad?

147
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,899
You are so dead.

148
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:37,979
No!

149
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,361
Ugh. Come here, you little...
(grunts)

150
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,953
(laughing)

151
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,948
<i>Stop it! You're killing me!</i>

-(glass shattering)

153
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,577
My school picture!

154
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,329
Daddy would like a word with you, Barty!

155
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,753
(grunts)

156
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,461
Help! Dad's trying to kill me!

157
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,961
It's hammer time, snitchy!

158
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,917
That's Snake's voice.

159
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,258
Of course. The transplant.

160
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,220
Somehow Snake's hair
must be controlling--

161
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,300
Oh, please, Lisa.

162
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,045
Everyone's already figured that out.

163
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,177
(whimpering)

164
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,805
You've got to fight the hair, Dad.

165
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,443
(normal voice) But I look
so youthful and hunky.

166
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,771
(Snake's voice)
The kid's got to die.

167
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,397
But I love my son.

168
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,823
More than a lush head of hair?

169
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,954
Don't make me choose!

170
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,990
(laughing wickedly)

171
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,656
No!

172
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,834
(straining)

173
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,537
I love you, Son.

174
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,835
I love you, too, Dad.

175
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,208

176
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,758
(muffled screaming)

-Get off! Get him off!
-(gasping)

178
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,890
I'll show you, hair!

Homer Simpson,

185
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,611
You're under arrest for the murders

186

of Moe Szyslak and Apu Nahasa... Pasa...

187
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,950
Uh, just Moe. Just Moe.

188
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,200
It wasn't me. It was the hair.

189
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,445
Freeze, hairball!

190
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,584

192
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,182

194
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,232
May I remind you
that two people are dead?

195

Oh, wait. I just got it.
(chuckles)

196
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,900
-(all laughing)
-It's funny.

197
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,356
Bad hair day!

00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,874
Bleh!

Hey! Hey!

201
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,625
Tonight, I'm going to suck!

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
Your blood!

203
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,514
OK, get ready for the violentest,

00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,928
Sorry, but if I let you watch

208
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,517
one of these
gruesome Halloween cartoons,

209
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,233
I'd be a pretty lousy mother.

211
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,646
Why don't you kids

212
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,493
come trick-or-treating
with Maggie and me?

213
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,739
Nah. It's too early.

214
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,660
I need to work under cover of darkness.

215
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,738
Hmm...

216
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,243
Oh, Homer,

217
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,704
you're not going as a hobo again?

218
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:38,905
Going where?

(chomping)

220
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,496
Well, we're leaving.

00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,043
And remember, no <i>Itchy & Scratchy.</i>

-(buzzing)
-Hmm...

232
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,821

It's highly unstable.

This little piggy went nuts.

343
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,606

All right, I got it.

Oh! She's entering
the terrible twos, all right.

358
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,650
It's probably nothing,
but we just wanted to be sure.

Fire, and lots of it.

362
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,905
Oh, that's your cure for everything.

363
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,578
(birds twittering)

364
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,075
(rattling)

365
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,245
(squeaking)

366
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,423
{\an8}Poor, Maggie. If only you could tell us

367
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,882
{\an8}what's happening to you.

368
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,375
(rhythmic sucking)

369
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,903
(sucking sounds continue)

370
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,360
Commander Kang,

371
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,899
receiving transmission
from Infant Pod 13.

372
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,202
Holy phlerking schnit!

373
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,488
What's the message?

374
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,122
"Larval stage completed.

375
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,988
Standing by for orders.

376
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,157
Experiencing terrible rash.

377
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,406
Over."

378
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,707
Ensign Kodos, set coordinates

379
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,171
for the obscure
T-shirt producing planet

380
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,382
known as Earth.

381
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,801
It's time I paid a visit to...

382
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,971
my daughter!

383
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,594
(gulps)

384
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,387
MAN (on TV): <i>We'll return with</i>
How Dracula Got His Groove Back.

385
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,560
(doorbell ringing)

386
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,522
Hello. Oh, great. Mormons.

387
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,561
Actually, we're Quantum Presbyterians.

388
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,146
And we've come to see...

389
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,360
my daughter!

390
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,243
Oh, Lord.

391
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,321
I was hoping this day would never come.

392
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,277
Huh? What are you talking about?

393
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,407
You mean you never told him?

394
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,163
(sighs)

395
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,166
I guess I've been in denial.

396
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,714
Homer, Kang is Maggie's father.

397
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,054
(gasps)

398
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,669
You intergalactic hussy!

399
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,716
How could you?

400
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,798
(sobbing)

401
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,430
Was he better than me?

402
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,141
It all happened about two years ago.

403
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,932
There I was, having
a great time in the backyard,

404
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,647
when, without warning,
I was abducted by aliens.

405
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,189
-KANG: Warning! Warning!
-(gasps)

406
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,862
Prepare to be abducted.

407
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:50,985
Huh?

408
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,320
(moaning)

409
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,077
Congratulations.

410
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,659
You have been selected
for our cross-breeding program.

411
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,000
To put you at ease, we have recreated

412
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,632
the most common spawning locations

413
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,128
of your species.

414
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,046
You may choose either

415
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,799
the back seat of a Camaro,

416
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,591
an airplane bathroom,

417
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,014
a friend's wedding,

418
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,973
or the alley behind a porno theater.

419
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,314
I absolutely refuse
to go along with this.

420
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,308
But since I have no choice,
I'll take the alley.

421
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,308
(romantic music playing)

422
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,687
Initiate fertilization procedure.

423
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,315
(yawning)

424
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,492
Oh, you look lovely this evening.

425
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,781
Have you decreased in mass?

426
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,735
<i>MARGE: I tried</i>
<i>to resist, but they applied</i>

427
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,576
<i>powerful mind confusion techniques.</i>

428
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,912
Look behind you.

429
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,285
Insemination complete.

430
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,424
Really? That seemed awfully quick.

431
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,421
-What are you implying?
-Nothing, nothing.

432
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,423
Whoa, wow, look at the time.

433
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,755
I'd love to stay,

434
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,590
but I have an early meeting tomorrow.

435
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,965
You're a super girl, though.

436
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,602
I'll call you sometime.

437
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,563
Whoa!

438
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,483
Nine months later,
I gave birth to Maggie.

439
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,520
And now she must return home
to Rigel VII,

440
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,024
where she will be guaranteed

441
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:12,646
a lucrative Civil Service job for life.

442
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,574
Well, we can't compete
with that, but...

443
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,953
But nothing.

444
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,279
Get your slimeless hands off her.

445
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,025
People, people, space monsters.

446
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,287
This is going nowhere.

447
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,738
There's only one man

448
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,618
who can settle an argument
this bizarre.

449
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,790
{\an8}(audience chanting) Jerry,
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry...

450
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,247
OK, we're back.

451
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,706
Homer, how'd it feel to learn your baby

452
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,836
{\an8}was fathered
by a drooling space octopus?

453
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,934
{\an8}It made me angry, Jerry.

454
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,550
{\an8}Angry and tired.

455
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,716
Well, you're about to get
a whole lot angrier,

456
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,465
because we have the extramarital
extraterrestrial

457
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,388
{\an8}backstage in a soundproof booth
where he can't hear us.

458
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,187
{\an8}I hear all.

459
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,651
Ladies and gentlemen, meet Kang.

460
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,652
-(audience applauding)
-Hey.

461
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,824
Yeah!

462
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,033
(audience booing)

463
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,953
Mmm.
(smooching)

464
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:01,953
-AUDIENCE: Oh!
-You one-eyed,

465
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,374
two-timing (bleep).

466
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,492
I'm gonna (bleep).

467
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,998
Oh, yeah?

468
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,419
Well, (bleep) hyperbolic paraboloid!

469
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,078
(bleep) Yo mama!

470
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,587
(audience hooting)

471
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,054
Yeah, I got a question

472
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,720
for that gross thing, whatever it is.

473
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,798
-Homer.
-No, the green dude.

474
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,724
If you're that baby's daddy,
where you been at?

475
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,723
(growls)

476
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,144
(audience cheering
and applauding)

477
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,773
You know, somebody needs to learn

478
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,189
your green ass some responsibility.

479
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,848
-AUDIENCE: Yeah.
-(screams)

480
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,902
Now, hold on, Kang.

481
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,731
You can't bully my audience
with your fancy ray gun.

482
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:38,316
(audience screaming)

483
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,573
And now for my final thought.

484
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,661
Nobody wins when parents
put their petty squabbles

485
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,242
above the welfare of a child.

486
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,906
Let's hope they put
their differences aside,

487
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,616
and do what's best for Maggie.

488
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,206
-(hissing)
-Ow! What the (bleep)

489
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,712
Get the (bleep) baby off!
(bleep)

490
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,665
-Son of a (bleep)
-(groaning)

491
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,125
JERRY: Bouncers!
(muffled screaming)

492
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,835
-(Homer grunting)
-(Maggie straining)

493
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,394
I am so (bleep) embarrassed.

494
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,892
I can't believe it.

495
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,397
Jerry Springer didn't
solve our conflict.

496
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,809
And now he's dead.

497
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:17,027
Anyhoo, this is your last chance.

498
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,569
Turn over the baby now.

499
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:23,373
Or we will destroy
all your leaders in Washington.

500
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,236
Oh, you couldn't destroy
every politician.

501
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,747
Just watch us.

502
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,080
(both laughing)

503
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,000
BART: Don't forget Ken Starr.

504
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,093
Suckers.

505
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:43,643
Come on, Maggie, let's go home.

506
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,139
-(Kang's voice) Very well.
-(all gasp)

507
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,890
I'll drive.

508
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,182
(evil laughter)

509
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,847
KANG: <i>I need blood.</i>
