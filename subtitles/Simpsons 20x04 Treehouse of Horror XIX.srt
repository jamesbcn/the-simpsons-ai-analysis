1
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:21,321
Hello. I'd like to vote
for president, governor,

2
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,791
and anything that will take money
away from our parks and libraries.

3
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,793
Use machine number three.

4
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:33,258
I can't fit in the booth.

5
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,366
Use the double-wide.

6
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,240
Ooh!

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,176
One of those electronic voting dealies!

8
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:45,478
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
One vote for McCain. Thank you.

9
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,848
No. I want to vote for Obama.

10
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,717
Two votes for McCain.

11
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:53,420
Come on, it's time for a change!

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,288
Three votes for McCain.

13
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,423
No, no, no!

14
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,892
Six votes for President McCain.

15
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,461
Hey, I only meant one of those votes
for McCain!

16
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,029
This machine is rigged!

17
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,960
Must tell President McCain.

18
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:13,373
This doesn't happen in America.
Maybe Ohio, but not in America!

19
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:50,999
Okay. All I need is a
Christmas gift for Lisa.

20
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,015
I don't have time to read all that.

21
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:57,717
Hmm.

22
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:01,583
Montreal Expos jersey, Somber String,

23
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:05,655
jacks, no ball, and a Slunky.

24
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:11,431
Oh, I wouldn't give these to my
worst enemy, which happens to be Lisa.

25
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:16,716
Girls don't like trucks.
Come back when you're something else.

26
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,172
Perfect!

27
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,543
Merry Christmas, Dad.

28
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,646
We bought you
three more minutes of oxygen.

29
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:30,984
Thank you, son.
Can I play with it outside? Can I? Can I?

30
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,886
Sure.

31
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,496
Hmm.

32
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:46,066
Hey, Lise, I think I see one
with your name on it.

33
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,568
I don't know how
you could top last year's gift.

34
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,370
A box of your burps.

35
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,539
Yeah. Here's your stocking stuffer.

36
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:02,812
Wow! A Malibu Stacy Convertible!
Oh, Bart! An actual present.

37
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,827
That's right, Maggie. It's a car.

38
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,342
MALIBU STACY: Let's go to the...

39
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,247
Posibots, transform!

40
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,686
ALARM CLOCK: Snooze!

41
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,889
LAMP: Three-way!

42
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,395
BOOM BOX: Melody!

43
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,398
What?

44
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,938
Wait a minute. We're missing Sex Toy.

45
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,577
Where have you been?
- Where haven't I been?

46
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,019
Hmm. Is there something different
about the kitchen?

47
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,119
No.
- No. No.

48
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:21,379
Well, the toaster's
never lied to me before.

49
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,798
PINKROBOT: Hup, two...
SEX TOY: Nice planet.

50
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:41,915
Posibot engaged.
- Battle commencing in ten, nine, eight...

51
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,015
Hey!

52
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,753
Hey, Homer. How was your Christmas?

53
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:50,423
It was okay. I got Seinfeld, Season Seven.

54
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,394
Finally, a Boxing Day
that lives up to its name!

55
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:58,198
Lisa, what's happening?
- Well, if I had to guess,

56
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,701
I'd say that two alien robot races
who've been battling for centuries...

57
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,057
...have chosen our planet...

58
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:05,205
...as the site for their
ultimate confrontation.

59
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,705
It is a good planet to settle things on.

60
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,319
Oh! Ah!

61
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:24,434
Stop it! Stop it! Look! You have made
the nacho machine cry.

62
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,394
Cool!

63
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:37,034
Carnage Destructicus,
the moment has arrived, our final battle!

64
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,204
Your final battle, Bestimus Mucho!

65
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,845
Stop it! Just because
you're mad at each other...

66
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,181
...doesn't mean you have to
destroy our town.

67
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,617
That does not compute.
- Really?

68
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,252
It computes a little.

69
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,521
What's this whole intergalactic tiff
about, anyway?

70
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,523
You know, I don't remember.
- Neither do I.

71
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,563
Maybe the non-transformer thing is right.

72
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,929
Thank you, human grandmother,

73
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:07,066
for pointing out that it
is futile to fight...

74
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,434
...if we do not know why.

75
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,837
And now
that we are not fighting each other,

76
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:14,771
we can team up to enslave your planet.

77
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,211
That's great, because working
together, you can...

78
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,746
Oh!

79
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:25,985
Okay, who's the idiot who taught them
what foosball was?

80
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,635
I thought they might enjoy it.

81
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:18,338
Okay, Maggie. We'll be
back in three hours.

82
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,668
Or longer, if something happens to us.

83
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:29,482
Maybe we shouldn't do this.
She doesn't know anyone here.

84
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:33,086
Look, sweetie.
There's a familiar face. Krusty!

85
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,336
Hey, hey, kids! Your old pal Krusty's
gonna teach you five new words:

86
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,836
Unlicensed use of my image.

87
00:07:56,442 --> 00:08:00,780
All right, boys. See those Krustys
nobody paid me for?

88
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,880
Sandblast them!

89
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,492
Entertain the troops? No way!
What have they ever done for me?

90
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,961
Krusty, you made my daughter cry.

91
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:18,231
Hey, my intellectual property rights
were being infringed.

92
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:22,326
Do you know how that feels?
Do you? Huh? Do you?

93
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:43,547
One, two, three. One, two, three.
It's no use.

94
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,000
Mr. Simpson, you have quite a talent
for killing celebrities.

95
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,270
Well, I'm no drunk driving.

96
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,873
I'd like to introduce you
to some stereotypical ad men.

97
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,775
Simpson, we got
a swell little notion for you.

98
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,411
Did you know you can put
a dead celebrity in a commercial...

99
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:09,081
...and you don't have to pay them a thing?

100
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,818
Oh, my God! You finally did it!

101
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:27,191
You mixed Buzz Cola
with the smooth, rich taste of lemon!

102
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,703
Unfortunately, there are certain stars
who won't do what we want.

103
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,803
What's their problem?

104
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,273
They're still alive.

105
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:38,277
And then we thought,
'Who's good at killing celebrities?'

106
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,345
Me!

107
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:42,114
That's right!
Homer, would you be willing to acquire...

108
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,679
...some more accounts for us?

109
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:49,686
Well, you know, it is awfully hot today.

110
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,794
Now I'm too cold.

111
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,698
Mmm.

112
00:09:58,798 --> 00:09:59,866

113
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,867
Psycho killer Qu'est-ce que c'est

114
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:06,427
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-far better

115
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:12,272
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away

116
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:18,248
Oh, psycho killer Qu'est-ce que c'est

117
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:22,583
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-far better

118
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:28,251
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away

119
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:45,638
Psycho killer Qu'est-ce que c'est

120
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:49,340
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-far better

121
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:54,784
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away

122
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,425
We can't just sit here
while they exploit our images.

123
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,562
MAN: Hey, John Wayne, have you heard
about Stockswapper. Org's...

124
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,363
...low, low transaction fees?

125
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:07,700
Sounds... like... quite...
a... deal... pilgrim.

126
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,570
I hate... trans... action... fees.

127
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:16,309
Hey, George Washington!
See if you think this is funny!

128
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,409

129
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:26,419
MAN: It's the Springfield Wedding Chapel's
annual President's Day marriage-a-thon!

130
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,524
That ad implies that Mr. Lincoln
and I are betraying familiarities!

131
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:32,692
It's an outrage!

132
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,918
Yes, an outrage.

133
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:46,465
So are we gonna sit here flapping our jaws
or are we gonna do something about it?

134
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,176
Now wait just a gosh-darn minute here.

135
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,145
We can't go taking the law
into our own hands.

136
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,730
These are people with hopes and dreams...

137
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,247
Put a sock in it, mush mouth!

138
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:08,684
All we are saying is
let's eat some brains!

139
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,233
Great party, Homer.

140
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,303
Murdering Kate Winslet paid
for that chocolate fountain.

141
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,047
Golda Meir!

142
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,149

143
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,221
Mmm.

144
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,257
You ripped me off, see?
- No, I didn't, see?

145
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,060
You're gonna pay for what you done, see?

146
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:45,949
I always thought I'd
die of hepatitis, see?

147
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,170
Rip Taylor? You're not even dead!

148
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,872
Someone needs to check my apartment!

149
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,080
Let's get him!

150
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,850
Little sister,
is that moustache coming or going?

151
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,075
Well, your wife likes it.

152
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,291
You're all right, goofy grape.

153
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:15,027
People, please! We're
here to kill this jerk!

154
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:19,565
Before you kill me, I gotta know,
what is the one true religion?

155
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:22,640
It's a mix of voodoo and Methodist.

156
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,908
Shouldn't have left the key
under the mat, suckers!

157
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,910
So what do you do for fun around here?

158
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,580
Well, tonight we've got
a poker tournament at the rec center.

159
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,478
Ooh! After you, Mr. Pennyface.

160
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:42,907
Is your wife up here?
- Well, we have an understanding.

161
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,389
Mmm.

162
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:50,984

163
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,103
Good grief.

164
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:38,811
I like your witch costume, Lisa.
- I'm not a witch. I'm a Wiccan.

165
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:42,014
Why is it when a woman is confident
and powerful, they call her a witch?

166
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:48,349
What did you say, Mom?
- Nothing. I'm practicing my trombone.

167
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,757
So what are you wearing
to the Halloween party, Milhouse?

168
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,259
I'm not going to the party.

169
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:58,459
I'm going to the pumpkin patch
to wait for the Grand Pumpkin.

170
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,466
That means, 'You kids have fun.'

171
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,370
What's the Grand Pumpkin?

172
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,829
Every Halloween, the Grand Pumpkin...

173
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:09,875
...visits all the pumpkin
patches in the world...

174
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,878
...and brings candy to
kids who truly believe.

175
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:17,149
Milhouse, for the last time,
I made that up to mess with you!

176
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:21,854
The Grand Pumpkin isn't real!
- I appreciate you testing my faith, Bart.

177
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:25,958
But it's not necessary. I believe
in the Grand Pumpkin, almighty gourd,

178
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:29,428
who was crustified over
Pontius Pie-Plate and ascended into oven.

179
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:34,033
He will come again to
judge the filling and the bread...

180
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,133
Sigh.

181
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:42,474
You've all come to wait
for the Grand Pumpkin with me!

182
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,543
Who wants to sing pumpkin carols?

183
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,478
I've got a pumpkin carol for you.

184
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,483
You are such a stupid moron
It makes people want to punch you

185
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,313
The Grand Pumpkin's super gay

186
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,395
Punch, punch, punch, punch, wedgie!

187
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,493
Your God is wrong.

188
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:02,995
Let's get to the Halloween party.

189
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,831
I want to hit the apple tank before
all of the Granny Smiths are bobbed out.

190
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,734
Lise, you coming?
- I think I'll stay with Milhouse.

191
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,270
His glasses fog up when he cries.

192
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,580
More Granny Smiths for me.

193
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:25,684
Lisa! Lisa! Wake up! He's here!
- What? The Grand Pumpkin is here?

194
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:28,754
No. I'm rehearsing what I'm gonna say
when he shows up.

195
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:31,659
He's here. He's here! He is here!

196
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,587
You owe me restitution!

197
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:41,433
If he sees us fighting, he might not come!

198
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:49,172
Grand Pumpkin, I know you're real.
Why won't you show yourself?

199
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,241
Why?

200
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,479
Happy Halloween!

201
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:08,322
The Grand Pumpkin! You are real!

202
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,332
That's right, Milhouse.

203
00:17:10,432 --> 00:17:14,172
Your childlike belief
has brought me to life.

204
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:19,305
I knew you'd come! I even baked you
a loaf of homemade pumpkin bread!

205
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:23,655
How delightful.
Bread made especially for pumpkins.

206
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,914
Actually, it's made from pumpkins.

207
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:34,853
Uh-oh.

208
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,319
Revenge!

209
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:46,065
I'm gonna give you crossed eyes,
like you might see on an idiot,

210
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,000
a stupid triangle nose, and a big mouth...

211
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,004
...full of the ugliest-shaped
teeth there are.

212
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:56,507
Square! And I'm gonna
make your friends watch.

213
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,546
No!

214
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,554
Ladies.

215
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,654
Stupid.

216
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,902
Everybody, listen!
The Grand Pumpkin is real!

217
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,127
Hey! No hard-soled shoes!

218
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,977
Oh, God! Everywhere I look!

219
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,672
Pumpkin atrocities!

220
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,821
Care for a pumpkin seed?

221
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,485
You roast the unborn?

222
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,160
Touch me and I'll cut your friend.

223
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,660
What do I care? That's a yellow pumpkin.

224
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,767
You're a racist!
- All pumpkins are racist.

225
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,332
The difference is I admit it!

226
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,172
NELSON: I'd rather die than hate!

227
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,707
This is all my fault!

228
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:06,111
The Grand Pumpkin said my childlike
belief was what made him come to life!

229
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,813
Belief, eh?

230
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,248
Hmm.

231
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:13,385
Say, Milhouse, have you by any chance
ever heard of Tom Turkey?

232
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:17,055
No. Who is he and what's his origin story?

233
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,324
Well, Tom is a magical turkey...

234
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:22,227
...who gave the Pilgrims the technology
to put buckles on their hats.

235
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,898
Now he appears every Thanksgiving
to children who believe.

236
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,666
Sounds plausible.

237
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:31,497
Tom Turkey, help me. I believe in you.

238
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:36,312
Are you looking for a particular part
of my brain, or...

239
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:44,405
Halt, yon pumpkin, most succulent
and plump! I be Tom Turkey!

240
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,915
A giant talking turkey? Preposterous!

241
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:55,056
Prepare for the Almighty's judgment,
thou stinking fruit of rotted vine!

242
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,426
Pumpkin segregation forever!

243
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,140
I can't live on the outside! I can't!

244
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,447
Milhouse, your childlike innocence
saved us all!

245
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,349
Tom, how can we repay you?

246
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:21,086
How about a Thanksgiving feast?
You can carve the turkey!

247
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,916
You eat turkeys?

248
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,320
Yeah, it's delicious!

249
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,728
Especially when we take stuffing
and shove it up the turkey's ass.

250
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:32,296
Revenge!

251
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:41,106
Looks like those kids found
the true spirit of Halloween,

252
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:44,141
or Thanksgiving, or whatever.

253
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,811
And for those of you who feel like...

254
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,614
...we've trampled on
a beloved children's classic,

255
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:52,879
I encourage you
to write to the following address.

256
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,076
Happy holidays, everyone!
