Just look at these amusing caricatures
of Gore Vidal and Susan Sontag.

338
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,270
Yeah, I guess those are kind of funny.

339
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:54,395
Bart, children, this whole sordid affair
has been a shock to all of us.

340
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,824
But we must get on
with our lives.

341
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,914
Let's try to remember Krusty,
not as a hardened criminal,

342
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,530
but as that lovable jester who honked

343
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,617
his horn and puttered around
in his little car.

344
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,712
- And shot you out of a cannon.
- And shot me out of a cannon.

345
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,958
Yes, we will never
forget that, will we?

346
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:13,131
Bart, open you heart. I admit I
have some mighty big shoes to fill.

347
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,382
Big shoes to fill.

348
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:20,545
Big shoes to fill.
Big shoes to fill.

349
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,756
Big shoes to fill.
Big shoes to fill.

350
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,387
Big shoes to fill...

351
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,698
In ancient Greece, there was
a school of thought called stoicism.

352
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,688
Wait a minute! You did it!

353
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,693
- Excuse me?
- Attention, fellow children!

354
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,236
Krusty didn't rob that store!
Sideshow Bob framed him,

355
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,700
and I got proof!

356
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,201
My foot!
You lousy, stupid, clumsy...

357
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:46,873
See that? Krusty wore big floppy shoes,

358
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,414
but he's got little feet
like all good-hearted people!

359
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,128
Sideshow Bob really fills his shoes

360
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,419
with big ugly feet.

361
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,674
- Kid's right.
- How do you figure we missed that?

362
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,506
Get off your duffs, boys.
Get down to that studio!

363
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:04,512
Yes, I admit it.
I hated him!

364
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:08,056
His hackneyed shenanigans
robbed me of my dignity for years.

365
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:11,851
I played the buffoon while he squandered
a fortune on his vulgar appetites.

366
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,357
That's why I framed Krusty!

367
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,539
And I would have gotten away with it
too if it weren't for these meddling kids.

368
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,857
Take him away, boys.

369
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,534
Treat kids as equals!

370
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,373
They're people too!
They're smarter than you think.

371
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,159
They were smart enough
to catch me!

372
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,632
Well, we... made...

373
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,050
a terrible, terrible mistake.

374
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,419
It won't happen again.

375
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,926
- It better not, you dimwit!
- Krusty,

376
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:45,889
I'm man enough to admit I was wrong,
and I'm sorry I fingered you in court.

377
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,141
I sincerely hope that
the horrible stories I heard

378
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,523
about what goes on
in prison are exaggerated.

379
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,940
Well, the important thing is that
I regain the trust of the children.

380
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:57,611
But there was one boy who
trusted me all along. Bart?

381
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,901
- Yes, sir?
- Thank you.

382
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,964
♪♪

383
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,215
Shh.
