being with their family on Christmas?

346
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,496
-Uh-huh.
-Well, being without them is worse.

347
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,211
Can you find it in your wooden heart
to give me a break?

348
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,383
All right, listen, pal, uh...
you want to go to a party?

349
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,593
(dance music playing)

350
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,611
What are you doing here?

351
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,149
Halloween merchandise goes on sale
December 26th, man.

352
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,284
("O Holy Night" playing)

353
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,829
Well, he's not in the neon sign store.

354
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,502
-Lady, buy a sign or go home.
-I'm sorry.

355
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:25,092
I'm trying to find my husband,
and nothing's open.

356
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,879
Well, there is a party here.

357
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,212
Hey, is your husband into people
dressed like food?

358
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,178
Where is this party?!

359
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,008
(electrical crackling)

360
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,103
♪ ♪

361
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,929
Oh, my God.

362
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,604
Is that girl really doing that?!

363
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,190
Mm, load-bearing wall.

364
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,815
(whoops)

365
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,079
(moans)

366
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,500
Ho, ho, ho!

367
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,039
This party's great,
but all I wish

368
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,793
is that I was drinking a beer
with my kids right now.

369
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,496
-MARGE: Homer?
-Hmm?!

370
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,506
Homie, I'm your present tonight.

371
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,969
And the present is that I'm not gonna
always assume that you screwed up.

372
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,892
Because I realize maybe there's
a good explanation for what you do.

373
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,352
Or a crazy one
that's pretty entertaining.

374
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,523
Oh, Marge, you found me!

375
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,313
You always find me.

376
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:29,146
Now we just have to find your car
in the mall parking lot.

377
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,613
I thought I had
one of those chirping keys.

378
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,363
Oh, well,
I've been faking the noise.

379
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,066
'Cause you deserve the best.

380
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,616
-(imitates car chirp)
-You didn't have to do that.

381
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,490
I love you just the same.

382
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,957
-(imitates car chirp)
-(moaning)

383
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,294
Thank you, magical creatures of the mall!

384
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,667
-Welcome.
-You have all taught me

385
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,463
a Christmas message
I'll never forget--

386
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:56,048
the place to get drunk is at home.

387
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,853
("Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" playing)

388
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,279
All right, I'm sick of waiting.

389
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,656
Bart, you know you can't open a present
till Mom and Dad wake up.

390
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,714
(scoffs) It's 9:10 a.m.

391
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,118
I know what they're doing--

392
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,416
they're up in bed
watching the re-broadcast

393
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,210
of the Hollywood Christmas Parade.

394
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,804
Oops, my finger slipped.

395
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,549
Oops! So did mine.

396
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,720
-(laughing)
-Oh, I got a baseball glove.

397
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,129
LISA: I got a chemistry set.

398
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,927
BART: I want yours.

399
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,811
Merry Christmas, son.

400
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,942
Uh, don't you mean "Happy Birthday"?

401
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,899
It's two presents.

402
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,023
Um, walkie-talkies
don't count as two presents.

403
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,277
God. I mean, You.

404
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,163
(sighs)

405
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,528
