got "C" averages,

49
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,272
we could go
to Kamp Krusty.

50
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,020
And with no false modesty,

51
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,272
you're looking

Heh, yeah, well...

53
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,609
just remember,
when you see my report card

54
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,401
they got this whole new
grading system this year.

55
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,404
It now goes,
"D," "B," "A," "C."

56
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,856
Now, listen, boy,
we have an understanding

57
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,277
and you better keep
your end of it.

58
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,155
I don't think I'd be
any kind of a father

59
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,792

I let you go to Kamp Krusty.

have happened?

87
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,597

88
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,890
Okay, calm down.

89
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,934

a little typo.

92
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,943
There appears to be
a mistake on my report card.

93
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,233
You gave me a B+
in conduct?

94
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,817

needs a blotch

95
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,072

permanent record.

96
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,613
Perhaps I'm not
making myself clear.

97
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,618
I think you should reconsider.

98
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,830
Lisa... you're hurting me.

99
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,368
Mrs. Krabappel,
in figuring out my final grades

100
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,837
I hope you'll note
that all of my textbooks

101
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,088
are being returned
in excellent condition--

102
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,470
In some cases, still
in their original wrappings.

103
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,089
Duly noted.

104
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:04,255
I'd also like to add,
as I gaze upon your beauty,

105
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,845
I've never seen
an angel fly so low.

106
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,562
Forget it, short pants.

107
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,364
Mrs. Krabappel, If I don't get
at least a "C" average

108
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,229
I can't go to Kamp Krusty.

109
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,146

Well, Dad,
here's my report card.

162
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,325
I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised.

163
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,660
"A+"? You don't think
much of me, do you, boy?

164
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,247
-No, sir.
-You know,

165
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,132
a "D" turns into
a "B" so easily.

166
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,589
You just got greedy.

167
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,499
So I won't get to go to camp?

168
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,418
Now, Bart, we made this deal

169
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,426
because I thought it would
help you get good grades,

170
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,258
and you didn't.

171
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,303
But why should you pay
for my mistake?

172
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,597
You mean I can go?

173
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,140
Yeah, I didn't want you

174
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,983
hanging around
all summer anyway.

175
00:07:56,058 --> 00:08:00,018
Oh, Dad, you're the best father
a boy could ever have.

00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,064
Thanks, son.

177
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,767
Now you got little hands.

178
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,977
Can you reach under that mower
and pull out that skate?

179
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:07,697
(engine whirring)

180
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,738
Pff. Never mind.

181
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,994
(Marge humming)

182
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,077
Bart, where's your
bathing suit?

183
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,423
-I'm gonna swim naked.
-You're what?

184
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,339
Ah, sure, there'll be
a couple of uptight counselors

185
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,418
who won't dig
the Bart philosophy,

186
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,014
but I feel the human body
is a thing of beauty.

187
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,010
Marge, am I crazy
or is my back getting hairier?

188
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,014
Before I go to camp,
I'll need boosters

189
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,966
for malaria,
German measles

190
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,267
encephalitis,
Hansen's disease.

191
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,390
Oh, now, I'm afraid
what we have here

192
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,017
is an advanced case
of hypochondria.

193
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,654
There's only one
known cure:

194
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,981
A wowipop.
(laughs)

195
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,198
Don't patronize me, doctor.

196
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,318
It's our last family
dinner for six weeks,

197
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,696
but I promised myself
I wouldn't cry.

198
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,584
(grunting and slurping)

199
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:01,292
(sobbing)

200
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,714
Oh, I'm going to miss this.

201
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,804
Hey, hands off my pickle.

202
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,129
I don't see your name
on it, boy.

203
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,884
No, but...

204
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:10,966
Oh, yeah?

205
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,430
Checkmate.

206
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,141
Always thinking
two moves ahead.

207
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,312
We'll see you
when you get back

208
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,561
from image
enhancement camp.

209
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,442
Spare me your euphemisms.

210
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,609
It's fat camp for Daddy's
chubby little secret.

211
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,569
You promised you wouldn't
make a scene.

212
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,649
(kissing loudly)

213
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,074
Good-bye,
my special little guy.

214
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,663
Lisa, watch out
for poison ivy.

215
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,580
Remember, leaves of three,
let it be.

216
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,750
Leaves of four, eat some more.

217
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,870
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye, Mom!

218
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,246
-Good-bye!
-Good-bye, Dad!

219
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,922
I'll write you every day.

220
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,291
Don't look in my closet.

221
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,127
In fact, stay out of
my room altogether.

222
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,802
If the pets die don't
replace them. I'll know!

223
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,770
(cheering)

224
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,599
WOMAN: So long!
Don't come back.

225
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,316
<i>Hi, kids.</i>
<i>Welcome to Kamp Krusty.</i>

226
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,071

227
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,824

<i>Until then,</i>

228
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:19,536
<i>I've turned things over to my bestest</i>
<i>buddy in the whole wide world--</i>

229
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,999
<i>(a different voice:)</i>
<i>Mr. Black.</i>

230
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,158
<i>-I want you to treat...</i>
<i>-Mr. Black</i>

231
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,117
<i>...with the same respect</i>
<i>you would give me.</i>

232
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,077
<i>-Now, here's...</i>
<i>-Mr. Black.</i>

233
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,509
Thank you, Krusty,
and welcome, children.

234
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,129
I am Mr. Black,
your head counselor.

235
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,546
For the past 15 years,

236
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,755
I was president
of Euro-Krusty land

237
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,595
until it blew up.

238
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,810
I'll take any questions
you might have.

239
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,771
You and then, uh...
one more.

240
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,521
Can we call you
Uncle Blackie?

241
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,103
No. Last question.

242
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,518
When do we get
to see Krusty?

243
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,606
Uh, he will be
along eventually.

244
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:51,901
In the meantime
our counselors,

245
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,534
Dolph, Jimbo, and Kearney

246
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,701
will be happy to handle
any problems you may have.

247
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,788
(coughs)

248
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,828
Looks like we got ourselves
a troublemaker.

249
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,292
Hee hee hee.

250
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,917
You can have the shower
to yourself, Homie.

251
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,593
-I'm finished.
-Oh, no, you're not.

252
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,133
Ooh.

253
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,547
KEARNY:
Here's your cabin.

254
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,595
If you don't like it, T.S.

255
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,759
(chicken clucking)

256
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,400
This is a little more rustic
than I expected.

257
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,783
I'm not worried, Lis.

258
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,149
You know why?

259
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,696
{\an8}Because of this--

260
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,859
{\an8}The Krusty brand
seal of approval.

261
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,068
{\an8}You can only
find it on products

262
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,487
{\an8}which meet the high
personal standards

263
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,075
{\an8}of Krusty the Klown.

264
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,120
Ow!

265
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,745
Oops, I should have
warned you.

266
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,672
That clock gets incredibly hot
if you leave it plugged in.

267
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,751
That's okay.
Uh... all this stuff is fine.

268
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,298
(warbling laughter)

269
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,091
Now, I am off to Wimbledon.

270
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,387
Don't we get
to roast marshmallows?

271
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,352
Shut up and eat
your pine cone.

272
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,565
Uh... are you sure that's safe?

273
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,533
Well, it ain't
getting any safer.

274
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,119
(gasping)

275
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,157
All right, you balls
of pan drippings,

276
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,667
I want to see Crisco
coming out of those pores.

277
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,000
We're not leaving

278
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,844
until this Christmas ham
gives me a pull-up.

279

Marge,
since the kids left,

302
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,334
I've lost five pounds.

303
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,584
Oh, that's wonderful.

304
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,337
And look, new hair.

We're all going
to die, Lis.

316
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,322

We'll miss

00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,419
Marge, we've got all
the fireworks we need

380

right here.

381
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,087
Well, kids, I promised you

382
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,675
a little treat
in lieu of dinner,

383
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,390
and here it is:

384
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,510
The man who took
an abandoned mule tannery

385
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,977
and turned it
into a summer wonderland:

386
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,098
Mr. Krusty the Klown.

387
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,845
See, I told you
Krusty would come.

388
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,607
Just like I said.

389
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,399
He's gonna bring us
food and water

390
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,982
and smite our enemies.

391
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,948
Now I must tell you kids,

392
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,160
Krusty has laryngitis
and a bad back,

393
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,540
so he won't be saying
anything or doing anything.

394
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,158
Krusty looks fat.

395
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,745
He's really having trouble
keeping his balance.

396
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,541
He's still funny,
but not ha-ha funny.

397
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,795
-That's not Krusty the Klown!
-(kids gasping)

398
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,469
What, do you think I slapped
a clown suit on some wino?

399
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,468
(nervous laughter)

400
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,890
Yeah, Bart, I am so
Krunchy the Klown.

401
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,970
(belching)

402
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,805
All right, that's it.

403
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,230
I've been scorched
by Krusty before.

404
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,809
I got a rapid heartbeat from
his Krusty brand vitamins.

405
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,395
My Krusty calculator didn't
have a seven or an eight.

406
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,441
And Krusty's autobiography
was self-serving

407
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,984
with many glaring omissions.

408
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,398
But this time,
he's gone too far.

409
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,107
We want Krusty!

410
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:56,907
(all chanting) We want Krusty!
We want Krusty!

411
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:00,752
Yeah, we want Krunchy!
We want Krunchy!

412
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,539
I thought you said
you broke their spirits.

413
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,333
We did.

414
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,496
You broke nothing.

415
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,794
BART:
Let's get 'em!

416
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,997
To the hydrofoil.

417
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,707
(angry shouting)

418
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,599
My chunky brothers,

419
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,600

422
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,613

423
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:31,612
Wiggum.

424
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,283
A change of underwear.

426
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,200
My insulin!

427
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,248
Bart, you said you're gonna
name it Camp Freedom.

428
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,541
Eh, this has more zing.

429
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,625

430
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,210
Urgent call

431
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,166

Where were you when
I sang at Farm Aid?

00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,286
Out of my way, you parasites.
I said out of my way!

I'm no fake.
I'm the real Krusty.

460
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,793
Oh, yeah?

461
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,458
Who played your daughter
on the short-lived sitcom

462
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,626
President Clown?

463
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,264
I don't know her name.

464
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,301
But she held up a
liquor store last year.

465
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,514
I smell bacon.

466
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,474
Let's see if he's
wearing a wire.

467
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,814
Hey, whoa!

468
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,719
-Not the face.
-(gasping)

469
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,557
LISA:
It is the real Krusty.

470
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,483
Look at that pacemaker scar.

471
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,021
The cattle skull birthmark,

472
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,364
and his famous
superfluous nipple.

473
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,230
Well, at least
you're not as bad as customs.

474
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,937
How could you, Krusty?

475
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,487
I'd never lend my name

(hysterical sobbing)

477
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,704
They drove a dump truck
full of money to my house.

478
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,826
I'm not made of stone.

479
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,374
Krusty, this camp
was a nightmare.

480
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,787
They fed us gruel.

481
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,375
They forced us to make
wallets for export,

482
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,050
and one of the campers
was eaten by a bear.

483
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,919
Oh, my God!

484
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,677
Well, actually, the bear
just ate his hat.

485
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,389
-Was it a nice hat?
-Oh, yeah.

486
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,559
Oh, my God!

487
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,309
Well, I'm gonna make it
all up to you.
