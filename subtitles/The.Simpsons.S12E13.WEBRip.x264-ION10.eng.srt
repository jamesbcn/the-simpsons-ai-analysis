{\an8}-All right, Moe Szyslak...
-Yes, Virgil?

17
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,261
{\an8}Yesterday we asked
if you wanted to risk it all

18
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,267
{\an8}for $500,000

19
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,139
{\an8}and you stalled for 20 minutes.

20
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,266
{\an8}Yes. Yes, I did. I was told to.

21
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,233
{\an8}Hey, that's great. But now we must
have your answer

{\an8}You want some of this? Well, do you?

25
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,990
{\an8}I can honestly say I do.

26
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,544
{\an8}All right, then.
For half a million dollars

27
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,998
{\an8}which of the following
is not a subatomic particle?

28
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,120
{\an8}Oy.

00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,206
{\an8}(Virgil reading)

30
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,418
{\an8}Oh, boy.

31
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,466
{\an8}All right, let's see here. Uh...

32
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,470
{\an8}Well, I was born in Indiana...

33
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,932
{\an8}so that ain't it.

34
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:21,221
{\an8}And, uh... hmm. I better call my lifeline.

00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,481
{\an8}Yello?

37
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,021
{\an8}Hey, Moe! We're watching you on TV!

38
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,265
{\an8}Yeah, I know, Homer.

{\an8}HOMER: <i>So, how's that</i>
<i>bowel obstruction doing?</i>

{\an8}Homer! Please. Heh-heh.

41
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,242
{\an8}I got a nuclear-type question here.

42
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,781
{\an8}Well, it all starts when

43
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,985
{\an8}a nulecule comes out of its nest.

44
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,785
{\an8}The answer is "bonbon"!

45
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,369
{\an8}I'm going to say "bonbon."

46
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,504
{\an8}"Bonbon," eh, Moe?

47
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,541
{\an8}Is that your... ultimate response?

48
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,844
{\an8}-Yuh-huh.
-Oh... you are...

49
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:49,748
{\an8}correct!

50
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,126
{\an8}(groans)

51
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,256
{\an8}Well, Moe, would you like
to stop where you are

52
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,340
{\an8}or try for $1 million?

53
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,636
{\an8}(audience gasps)

54
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,933
{\an8}Well... gee, I really do love currency

55
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,555
{\an8}but, um, I think I'm going to play it safe

56
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,772
{\an8}and stick with what I got.

57
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,652
{\an8}-You're the boss.
-Yes, I am.

58
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,363
{\an8}(cheering)

59
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:14,107
{\an8}Eh, this quiz show crap is just a fad.

60
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,904
{\an8}Well, fad or not, it's here to stay.

61
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,737
{\an8}And it's killing your show in the ratings.

62
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,872
{\an8}Hey, what do you want from me?
I do a kid show!

63
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,539
{\an8}And it's a classic.
We just want you to open it up.

64
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,749
{\an8}Run wild. Shatter
the boundaries. Slash and burn.

65
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,079
{\an8}Without alienating anyone.

66
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,504
{\an8}Oy, these <i>facockta </i>network notes.

67
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,004
{\an8}Can you believe this?

68
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,125
{\an8}(blowing raspberry)

69
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,012
{\an8}All we're saying is be dangerous.

70
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,588
{\an8}But warm. And edgy-cute.

71
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,093
{\an8}Aah!

72
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,836
{\an8}Did that exit work for you?

73
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,258
{\an8}I'd like to see it without the scream.

74
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,386
{\an8}I was just thinking that.

75
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,852
(barking rhythmically)

76
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,346
Hey, hey, kids!

77
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,186
Let's hear it for Madame Mimi

78
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,821
and her Cheese-Seeking Poodles!

79
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,160
We'll be back with a sketch set
in the <i>craziest </i>place...

80
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,280
a restaurant!

81
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,986
{\an8}(goofy laughter)

82
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,406
And... roll commercial.

83
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,124
Krusty? Yeah.

84
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,624
Quick thought about this restaurant set.

85
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:08,535
Huh?

86
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,293
Could it look more like a diner?

87
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,915
Ooh! The <i>Seinfeld </i>diner!

88
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,881
Are you nuts? I'm on in five seconds.

89
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,802
'Cause the great thing
about <i>Seinfeld </i>was...

90
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,880
You're on, Krusty.

91
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:23,095
Ah. Nothing like a meal
in a fine restaurant.

92
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,679
{\an8}Ah, here comes the waitress.

93
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,725
We're losing male teens.

94
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,729
Can you get jiggy with something?

95
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,771
{\an8}You're giving me notes
while I'm on the air?

96
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,524
That tears it!

97
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:37,026
Folks, I've been in show biz for 61 years,

98
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,900
but now these jerks have sucked
all the fun out.

99
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,118
I don't need 12 suits
telling me which way to pee.

100
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,619
Uh, for "pee," could you
substitute "whiz"?

101
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,002
I... don't know-- that could
upset the Cheez Whiz people.

102
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,619
I was just thinking that.

103
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,206
I can't take it anymore!

104
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,041
Folks, don't miss this Friday's show.

105
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,087
{\an8}It'll be my last!

106
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,380
(gasping)

107
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,673
Quitting show biz.

108
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,216
Yeah, I know I like the area,
but where does it go?

109
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,641
Get away from me!

110
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:03,799
Wait!

111
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,716
We have more notes!

112
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,603
(both grunting)

113
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,563
Get off, damn you!

114
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,693
You can kill me, but two more
will take my place!

115
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,895
{\an8}I can't believe Krusty's retiring.

116
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,567
This is tragic.

117
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,655
A world without Krusty.

118
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,743
What would that be like?

119
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,202
What's on TV?

120
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,407
Nutsy the clown.

121
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,206
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

122
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,423
Well, I think it's good
for a show to go off the air

123
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,843
before it becomes stale and repetitive.

124
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,012
Maggie shot Mr. Burns again!

125
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,760
(cricket chirping)

126
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,178
(coughs)

127
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,934
Krusty the Clown's retirement

128
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,096
has provoked an outpouring of anguish

129
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,225
not seen since the small plane crash

130
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,062
that killed the Banana Splits.

131
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,477
We now go live to Krustylu Studios.

132
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,896
(all sobbing)

133
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,145
<i>What's the mood there,</i>
<i>Chief Clancy Wiggum?</i>

134
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,697
These kids are getting
a little out of hand, Kent,

135
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,122
so we're going to have
to fire the time-out gas.

136
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,449
(all yelling)

137
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,077
Hey, Kent, are you guys
still having that contest

138
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,245
where we guess what city
the weather girl's in?

139
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,174
(chuckling) That was eight years ago.

140
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,382
Is it Pittsburgh?

141
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:23,012
I spoke to Krusty
about his legacy of laughter.

142
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,681
Kent, the young people today

143
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,140
they think comedy is dirty words.

144
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,601
It's not. It's words that <i>sound </i>dirty.

145
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:32,732
Like mukluk.

146
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,099
(both laughing)

147
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,725
KRUSTY (over P.A. system): <i>Mukluk.</i>

148
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,022
<i>You like that? No charge. Mukluk.</i>

149
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,067
Mukluk.

150
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,529
Oh, can it, you tiresome tot-sitter.

151
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,450
I was the risible one in our dyad.

152
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,409
Ever watch the old episodes?

153
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,369
Oh, Kent, that's a sad story.

154
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,289
I taped over all my old episodes.

155
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,699
{\an8}Oh, you know, I had a thing for Judge Judy

156
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,328
{\an8}and blank tape was $3.99.

157
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,576
{\an8}What would <i>you </i>do?

158
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,787
(gasps)

159
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,746
Those are <i>my </i>shows.

160
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,468
Frankly, Kent, those episodes
were no big loss.

161
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,969
The show didn't really get funny

162
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,850
until we fired Sideshow Bob
and hired whosits.

163
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,638
{\an8}You've erased my past.

164
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,443
{\an8}Now I'll erase your future.

165
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,770
Hey, hey, lights out!

166
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,024
Oh, honestly.

167
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,145
At Chino, they get to stay up till 9:00.

168
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,822
Now, Bob, I've talked
to the warden at Chino

169
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,241
and that's just not true.

170
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,819
{\an8}(grumbling)

171
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,738
Your Honor, my incarceration

172
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,445
is cruel and unusual punishment.

173
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,035
First, my prison-issued shower sandals

174
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,581
are grossly undersized.

175
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,043
Secondly, the prison book club

176
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,916
consists mainly of prisoners
who club me with books.

177
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,965
{\an8}These are from the new Tom Clancy.

178
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,878
{\an8}Although it's less painful
than reading him.

179
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,047
{\an8}Am I right, folks?

180
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,595
Motion granted! Release the prisoner!

181
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,019
(thunder rumbling)

182
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,767
Now, don't try anything funny
this time, Bob.

183
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,935
I'm going to be on you
like red beans on, uh...

184
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,025
Hey, hey, don't walk so fast.

185
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,110
Hey, no fair-- you got long legs.

186
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,816
I got these little bitty hooves.

187
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,816
(panting) Bob!

188
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,996
OK, here's your storage locker

189
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,119
just the way you left it.

190
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,786
Thank you, Raphael.

191
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,424
Now, this is a ticklish question, but...

192
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,712
You want to live in the box?

193
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,714
Cost you two bucks a day.

194
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,215
Oh, thank you, kind innkeeper.

195
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,304
You going to want a wake-up jab?

196
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,215
-Please.
<i>-( </i>in Spanish) <i>No Problemo.</i>

197
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,813
(humming a tune)

198
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,391
-(door opening)
-(in English) MAN: Hiya, neighbor!

199
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,306
(gasps)

200
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,443
Hey, wai-wai-wait. Whatcha writing there?

201
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,361
If you must know,

202
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,898
it's an exquisite scheme for revenge.

203
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,232
Ah, revenge, huh?

204
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,937
Half the guys in here are working on that.

205
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,374
(maniacal chuckle)

206
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,118
Well, mine's better.

207
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,292
Phase One begins in...

208
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,672
ten, nine, eight...

209
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,830
Oh, I can't wait!

210
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,971
Now, Bob, uh, your graduate degrees

211
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,338
more than qualify you
to be assistant janitor.

212
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,335
(chuckles)

213
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,466
My blushes.

214
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,263
But I am a bit troubled

215
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,516
by your constant attempts
to murder people.

216
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,768
To be fair, most of
those people were Bart Simpson.

217
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,311
(chuckling) Good luck.

218
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,936
That kid's like the Road Runner,
he won't go down.

219
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,113
Tell me about it.

220
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,901
(both chuckling)

221
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,405
Hey... you know, Bob,
your voice would be perfect

222
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,488
for the school's morning announcements.

223
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:38,737
Attention, the French club
picnic has been canceled.

224
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,908
(in French) <i>Quel dommage.</i>

225
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,206
(chuckles) (in English) You're hired.

226
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,920
It begins.

227
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,960
(evil chuckle)

228
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:49,883
(evil laughter)

229
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,629
I mean, my...

230
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,473
announcing career.
That's what's beginning.

231
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,022
SIDESHOW BOB: <i>Good morning.</i>
<i>Springfield Elementary.</i>

232
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,640
In the lost and found today,
we have one plaid kilt.

233
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,808
Ooh!

234
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,515
<i>I believe the clan is</i>
<i>"Graham of Montrose."</i>

235
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,607
Aw.

236
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:12,241
This new morning announcer
sounds awfully familiar.

237
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,780
<i>And finally, Bart Simpson</i>

238
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:18,124
<i>should immediately proceed, unescorted</i>

239
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,950
<i>to the old sports equipment shed</i>
<i>behind the school.</i>

240
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,207
(evil chuckling)

241
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,289
Ha. So long, suckers.

242
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,174
(humming)

243
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,591
(swings creaking)

244
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,509
-(wind whistling)
-(birds screeching)

245
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:36,801
<i>(ghostly voices)</i>
<i>♪ Ring around the rosy... ♪</i>

246
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,939
(screaming)

247
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,397
{\an8}-Hello, Bart.
-(gasps)

248
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,820
Oh, it's you, Bob. How you doing?

249
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,243
No screams?

250
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,656
Not even an "eep"?

251
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,990
Hey, I'm not afraid of you.

252
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,655
Every time we tangle, you wind up in jail.

253
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,754
I'm 6-0.

254
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,328
I'll admit that the record
is a little one-sided.

255
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:09,254
But this time, I cannot fail.

256
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,169
(growling)

257
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:15,224
Rakes. My old archenemy.

258
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,049
I thought I was your archenemy.

259
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,264
I have a life outside of you, Bart.

260
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,636
(thunder rumbling)

261
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,060
What're you going to do to me?

262
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,902
Oh, believe me, I have a plan.

263
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,018
Let's see.

264
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,065
Get job as school announcer...
Lure Bart to shed...

265
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,478
Secure same to chair with rope...

266
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:36,196
Ah, here we are. "Have Bart kill Krusty."

267
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,358
Krusty?

268
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,026
That's the one man I would never kill.

269
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,865
Oh, you will kill Krusty.

270
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,991
During his final show.

271
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,368
And you won't even know you're doing it.

272
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,129
Watch the shiny quarter, Bart.

273
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,004
That's it.

274
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:54,964
{\an8}Oh, damn it, where'd it go?

275
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,507
I needed that for laundry.

276
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,970
Hey, stupid.

277
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,760
(laughing) You looked.

278
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,854
(muttering)

279
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:08,385
Yes, that will do.

280
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,395
Watch the spiral, Bart.

281
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,690
Let it entrance you with its twirliness.

282
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,864
Twirliness.

283
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,695
{\an8}You are in my power.

284
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,780
{\an8}(robotically) I am at your command.

285
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,116
I didn't say anything about command.

286
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,791
You're in my power. Say so.

287
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,790
{\an8}I am in your power.

288
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,252
Excellent. Actually, go back to command.

289
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,582
No, power. Power.

290
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,299
Look, Krusty invited us to
the taping of his last episode.

291
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,335
(robotically) Hello, family.

292
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,217
Where've you been, young man?
It's nearly bedtime.

293
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,015
{\an8}I was... I was...

294
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,229
<i>If anyone asks</i>

295
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,689
<i>you were at the flower shop.</i>

296
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,150
{\an8}I was at the flower shop.

297
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,570
Oh, yeah, I was at the flower shop, too.

298
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,780
Yep, getting drunk at the old flower shop.

299
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:00,952
Mm-hmm.

300
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,370
Now, to see if you will really
attack your hero...

301
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,407
(yelling)

302
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,544
(grunting)

303
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,626
Yes, yes!

304
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,050
Work the groin.

305
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,219
Excuse me-- could you take our picture?

306
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,338
Uh, yeah.

307
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,264
It should focus automatically.

308
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,552
It do.

309
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,394
Chief, you might want
to take a look outside.

310
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,563
That's it!

311
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,351
Kill Krusty!

312
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,654
Just like you'll kill him tomorrow night!

313
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:37,319
Aw, it's so great to see
a kid using a wooden bat.

314
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,319
These days it's all aluminum this

315
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,611
and George W. that.

316
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,864
Hey, Chief, look what
I got in my Laffy Meal.

317
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,697
Oh, mini-pinball.

318
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,242
Hey, give that back.

319
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,735
{\an8}Give what back, Lou? (snickering)

320
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,118
Oh, yeah! (laughing maniacally)

321
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,088
Good evening, folks.

322
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,762
Welcome to my final clown-cast.

323
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,682
The word "legend" has many definitions...

324
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,221
(zombie-like) This is for Sideshow Bob.

325
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,597
(screaming)

326
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,273
(moaning)

327
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,232
Marvelous, marvelous.

328
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,232
Funny till the end.

329
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,233
Moment of silence.

330
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,734
Well, it's my show now.

331
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,146
(cheering and applause)

332
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,364
{\an8}Thank you, thank you...

333
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,243
{\an8}Thank you.

334
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,316
Hmm...

335
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,793
Oh, just a dream.

336
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:36,670
But tonight, I will taste
the sweet nectar of vengeance.

337
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,170
-(laughing)
-(knock on door)

338
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,882
ATTENDANT: Bug spray!

339
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,426
Ohh...

340
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,934
(karate yells)

341
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,688
Kent Brockman here at
Krusty the Clown's final show.

342
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,233
And here comes out-of-work
actor Ranier Wolfcastle.

343
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,606
Someone please, give me a job.

344
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,116
I've lowered my quote to $8 million.

345
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,828
(chuckling) Hear that, Hollywood?

346
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,239
The boy wants to work.

347
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,117
I do nude scene, I play nerd...

348
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,874
Don't make me punch your throat.

349
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,206
(chuckling) Always a delight.

350
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,431
ANNOUNCER: <i>And now, retiring</i>
<i>for the fifth and final time...</i>

351
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,932
<i>-Krusty the Klown!</i>
-(applause)

352
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,274
Thank you, folks.
Now, fasten your funny belts

353
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,024

354
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,936

SIDESHOW BOB: Bart...

361
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,630
Bart...

362
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,129
It's time, Bart.

363
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,131
Time to blow up the clown.

364
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,299
{\an8}Time to blow up the clown.

365
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,883
Go. Blow.

366
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,470
And now a special treat...

367
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:17,060
My TV debut on the <i>Milk of</i>
<i>Magnesia Summer Cavalcade.</i>

368
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,602
Let's watch.

369
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,056
{\an8}<i>Look at me.</i>

370
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,305
{\an8}<i>I am Kaputnik, the Russian satellite.</i>

371
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,988
{\an8}<i>Yah! The Bolshoi's doing</i>
<i>the Nutcracker in my pants.</i>

372
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:26,988
{\an8}(gasping)

373
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,739
Back then you couldn't say "pants" on TV.

374
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,662
I was banned for ten years.

375
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,040
Finally, I got
a second chance on <i>Laugh-In.</i>

376
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,905
Hey, Krusty, what do you get

377
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,417
when you cross a chicken with a beagle?

378
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,579
(banging and grunting)

379
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,417
KRUSTY: The facockta doors are stuck!

380
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,752
Don't just stare, Arty, help me!

381
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:51,012
Those lousy shutters
set me back another 22 years.

382
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,143
(applause and cheering)

383
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,675
(humming)

384
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:03,937
{\an8}(a la Jackie Gleason) Mm,
that's good plastic explosive.

385
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,363
{\an8}Ha-ha-ha.

386
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,909
Now, my little hypno-assassin,
your cue to attack will be

387
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,450
when Krusty says "I've never
had such a great audience."

388
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,906
You will run up and hug him

389
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:22,076
blowing each of you to smithereens.

390
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,206
Whatever.

391
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,343
Now we're going to show you
some clips from...

392
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,130
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

393
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,973
Oh, no!

394
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,049
I wanted to keep this quiet.

395
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,724
(chuckles) Can I embarrass
this guy for a moment?

396
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:38,603
Three years ago, Krusty pledged
over a million dollars

397
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,432
to start Krusty's Kare Center.

398
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,847
-(applause)
-Please, stop already.

399
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,896
To this day Krusty has not given us a dime

400
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,231
has he, Francis?

401
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,686
I'm cold all the time.

402
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:53,817
{\an8}Oh, look, it was all a bookkeeping snafu.

403
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,446
{\an8}-Could I have the check now?
-Now?

404
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,043
{\an8}Uh, sure.

405
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,658
{\an8}God bless you, Krusty.

406
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,785
ALL: Aww...

407
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,711
{\an8}And if my banker's watching

408
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,380
{\an8}let nothing <i>stop </i>you
from <i>payment </i>of this check.

409
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,221
Ah, the catwalk.

410
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,721
A perfect vantage point...

411
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,353
for revenge.

412
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,220
(chuckles evilly)

413
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:24,771
Ah, kettle chips, the perfect side dish...

414
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,310
for revenge.

415
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,437
What a special night.

416
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,065
And you know something?

417
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,991
{\an8}I've never had such a great audience.

418
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,491
Hmm?

419
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,116
{\an8}-We've had a lot...
-Poor Krusty.

420
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,753
This is your Waterloo.

421
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:48,041
Soon you'll be Napoleon Blownapart.

422
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,502
Ugh, terrible.

423
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,746
Oh, hush up, Leo.

424
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,553
You know, I'd like
to thank God for all my success

425
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,853
even though I never worshiped
or believed in Him in any way.

426
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:01,058
But before I sweep up my last spotlight

427
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,520
there's one thing I've got to say.

428
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,150
Over the years I've...

429
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,268
a lot of-- Whoa!

430
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,265
and I've-- guh, guh

431
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,357
my share of-- Ah-ooga!

432
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,702
but there's only one thing I'm ashamed of.

433
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,824
"Ashamed"?

434
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,195
There was a man who used to work for me.

435
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:23,003
A man of grace and humor,
but I mistreated him

436
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,458
and drove him to a life of crime

437
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,539
so wherever you are, I just want to say

438
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,375
Sideshow Bob, I'm sorry.

439
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:38,796

440
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,306

00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:55,403
{\an8}Oh, that sweet, funny man.

445
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,446
Oh, no!

446
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,700
My boy bomb!

447
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,776
Well, good night and...

448
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:06,248
Oh, look, it's a tow-headed little fan.

449
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,830
What do you say, folks?

450
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,535
-Should I hug him?
-ALL: Yeah!

451
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,931
No!

452
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,011
Hmm?

453
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,936
(yelling)

454
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,858
Oh, God, a bomb!

455
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,400
I was just thinking that.

456
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,823
(resigned sigh)

457
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,317
What happened? Was anyone hurt?

458
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,985
Just some network executives.

459
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,631
BOTH (robotically): We have notes.

460
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,881
Have you thought about Dave Chapelle?

461
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,755
Destroy!

462
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,551
OK, everybody,

463
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,346
say "funny."

464
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,849
ALL: Funny!

465
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,020
Perfect.

466
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,229
Krusty, I'm so sorry
about the attempted murder.

467
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,984
Will you stop with the sorry?

468
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,277
Every time you try to kill me

469
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,071
my ratings go through the roof, you nut.

470
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,445
We are good together, Krusty.

471
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,623
It makes me sad that you're
getting the death penalty.

472
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:31,123
-Ah. Don't remind me.
-(squeaking)

473
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:34,076
(sighs) OK, where do you want
to do this thing?

474
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,747
Isn't it customary to have a trial?

475
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,336
Oh, a wise guy, huh?

476
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,509
(theme music playing)

477
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,890
