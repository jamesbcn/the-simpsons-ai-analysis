1
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:06,533
D'oh!

2
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,838
Aha!

3
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:10,163
Today we induct the newest honoree
to the Springfield Wall of Fame,

4
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:13,466
who will take his place along
such luminaries as Duffman,

5
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:17,871
Poochie and the man
who invented the yield sign, Paul Yield.

6
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:22,042
Now please welcome the newest inductee
into the Springfield Wall of Fame,

7
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,376
local businessman,

8
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:28,281
frequent flyer silver cardholder,
and legendary 20% tipper,

9
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:32,312
Springfield's own Vance Connor!

10
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,214
Hi, hi.
- MAN: You're better than us!

11
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,630
Homer, that guy's your age?
- No, he's ten days younger.

12
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,032
So you're saying he'll look like you
in ten days?

13
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,467
If he's lucky.

14
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:51,704
The guy owns a few local businesses
and everyone treats him like he's God!

15
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:54,841
Well, God doesn't need
his own special day.

16
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,109
What about Sunday?

17
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:00,280
Sunday's the Lord's day, boy. Not God's.
Completely different guy.

18
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,085
Your father's just jealous because Vance
was our class president in high school.

19
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,553
If I had won class president,

20
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,222
I'd be the one getting
thrown up in the air right now.

21
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,724
Dad, you ran for class president?

22
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,727
Yep. Back in high school,
right before I met your mother.

23
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,831
A simpler time
when the only thing we worried about...

24
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,533
...was total nuclear annihilation.

25
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:21,601
...

26
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,069
Rock the boat
- Don't rock the boat, baby...

27
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,504
Rock the boat
- Don't tip the boat over

28
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,573
So under my reign as vice president,

29
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,142
we sent three mathletes
to the state finals.

30
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:32,045
All of the tenth graders'
lima beans germinated.

31
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,048
ALL: Yeah!
- Yeah, you should be proud.

32
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,617
So if you want to build on that,
vote for me,

33
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:41,653
and you will all advance with Vance!

34
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,060
Now I'm gonna throw it back to a guy
who, in my opinion,

35
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,229
is the classiest
principal in the business,

36
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,031
Principal Dondalinger!

37
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:55,201
Ladies, I've seen him up close.
And, yes, his eyes are that green.

38
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,071
Our next candidate is Homer Simpson.

39
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,607
Please hold your applause forever.

40
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,478
My fellow Wildcats.

41
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,705
My name is Homer Simpson.

42
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,384
There are many reasons why I...

43
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,952
I... I...

44
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,054
You know what?

45
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,660
I spent all night working on that speech.

46
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,796
But now I realize the best thing to do
is speak from my heart.

47
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,936
WOMAN: His heart!
- So...

48
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,400
I feel that... Fellow Wildcats...

49
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:37,377
Webster defines...
In the words of Ted Nugent...

50
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:40,780
You... School spirit... Next card...
The future...

51
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,718
I've never heard a speech so bad.
Ten days detention!

52
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:46,786
No fair!

53
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:50,156
Anyone who votes for Vance
gets a half day tomorrow.

54
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,256
Half day, eh?

55
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,663
Don't feel bad, Homie. I married you!

56
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,598
And you're a million times better than...

57
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,064
...Here comes Vance!

58
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,203
Hey, Vance!
- Thanks for coming out.

59
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,193
Hey, Gail. I love your bangs.
- Hi.

60
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:10,543
There they are.
My favorite mixed-race couple.

61
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:14,047
Guys that popular and confident
are never truly happy.

62
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,849
He looks happy.
- Tears of a clown.

63
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,452
He's not crying.
And he's not known for clowning.

64
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:24,090
Exception that proves the rule.
If losers like me know one thing,

65
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,660
it's that deep down,
winners like him are miserable.

66
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,787
Watch, I'll prove it.
Angry nut coming through!

67
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,898
Clear a path, boys.

68
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,771
Hey, Vance.
- Hey, Homer Simpson. How you been?

69
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:43,676
Great. Thanks. Listen, settle a bet.
Behind that smile, you're dying, right?

70
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,846
Behind this smile is a bigger smile
trying to get out.

71
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:50,404
Oh! Oh! Here it comes! Oh, yeah!

72
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,653
Please! You gotta have some secret agony!

73
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,488
I bet those fancy shoes hurt your feet.

74
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,590
No. Actually they're
like two leather clouds.

75
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,658
Oh!

76
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,960
Got them from a buddy of mine
with a store in Shelbyville.

77
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,858
You want his number?
- No. Yes.

78
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,636
Hey, Homer. You want to try
my new Vance Connorpolitan?

79
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:13,906
Like Vance, it is smooth, cool,
and oh so sophisticated.

80
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,042
I'll just stick with my beer.

81
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,678
Homer, why are you so down
on Vance Connor?

82
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,047
He gave me one of his kidneys.
- Yeah, me, too.

83
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:26,417
Because when Vance beat me
in that election, he ruined my life.

84
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,921
Why did you just exchange
that look of guilt?

85
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:32,458
Lenny, I think it's time
for us to come clean.

86
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,260
About how we give each other haircuts?

87
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,198
No. We'll take that secret to our graves.
I'm talking about... You know.

88
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,067
Right. Listen, Homer.

89
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:44,907
Something weird
happened back in high school.

90
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,540
Teenage Carl and I
were walking down the hallway when...

91
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,477
You two. I want you to take this box
and bury it in the woods.

92
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:56,082
The true results of this election
must never be known.

93
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,652
I tell you what.
We'll do it under one condition.

94
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,854
Our parents want us to go to college.

95
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:05,925
But with a bad enough recommendation
from you, we can stay here and party.

96
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,794
Okay. But screw this up...

97
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,530
...and it's Carnegie Mellon University
for the both of you!

98
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,538
So there's a chance I actually won.
I gotta dig up that ballot box!

99
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,801
Just let it go, Homer.
- AI Gore?

100
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:26,546
Homer, I had a presidential election
stolen from me. But I moved on.

101
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:30,917
And I think you could say
everything worked out all right.

102
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,508
Isn't that right, Alfred?

103
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,678
'It sure is, Albert.'

104
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:46,974
Ballots stolen. Real winner unknown.
What is the truth? I gotta know!

105
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:52,872
Lenny, wake up!
- Finally you return my shovel!

106
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,741
That's not why I'm here. Get dressed!

107
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:59,545
California casual or business attire?
- California casual.

108
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,918
There it is!
- The ballot box?

109
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:10,863
No. This is the box that tells us
where the ballot box is.

110
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,225
What will this box reveal?

111
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,400
And what will I use this box
for afterwards?

112
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,504
Mismatched nuts and bolts? Recipes?
I may never know.

113
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,038
LISA: Vance Connor.
HOMER: D'oh!

114
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,373
LISA: Homer Simpson.
HOMER: Woo-hoo!

115
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:28,875
Vance Connor.
- D'oh!

116
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,309
Homer Simpson.
- Woo-hoo!

117
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:31,544
Vance Connor.
- D'oh!

118
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:32,979
Homer Simpson.
- Woo-hoo!

119
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,982
Please stop doing that.
- 'D'oh,' or 'woo-hoo'?

120
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:41,486
Both. Homer Simpson, Vance Connor,
Fonzie, Homer Simpson.

121
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,456
And the winner is...

122
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,615
...Homer Simpson.

123
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,027
Yes! I'm senior class president!

124
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,531
I get a parking spot
if the assistant principal isn't using it!

125
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:57,770
Wait a second. If I'd been class president
like I was supposed to,

126
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,274
I'd be the one with the big mansion,
and the color TVs, and the hot wife!

127
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,143
Hey!
- Marge, I still would be married to you,

128
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,345
but you would just be hotter.

129
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,413
Ohhh!

130
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,482
Dad, just 'cause you won
a high school election...

131
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,684
...doesn't mean your whole life
would've been better.

132
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,486
That's exactly what it means!

133
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:16,456
And Dondalinger took that life
away from me!

134
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,859
And the taking of a life is murder!
And the punishment for murder is...

135
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,395
Well, it varies from state to state
and by race,

136
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,597
but I'm gonna find Dondalinger...

137
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,433
...and tell him
I know what he did last summer,

138
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,366
22 years ago in the winter!

139
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,485
That's the thing about
you assistant principals.

140
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,720
You can drive the ball but you can't putt.

141
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,823
Wait a minute. You're not in our foursome.

142
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,793
No other foursome would have me.
My legs gross people out.

143
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,893
HOMER: Dondalinger!

144
00:09:58,397 --> 00:09:59,365
Uh-oh.

145
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:04,003
Looks like one of my former students
on a quest for truth.

146
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,672
Dondalinger,
I should've been class president!

147
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,941
But you stole the election from me!

148
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:13,279
I can explain. But are you sure
we should talk in front of your son?

149
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,315
Yes! I want him to know that if your life
doesn't turn out the way you want,

150
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,717
there's someone else to blame!

151
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,253
I already knew that, Dad.
I'm gonna blame you.

152
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,521
I respect your choice.

153
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,190
Now drive back to the clubhouse
and order me a Tom Collins.

154
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,725
With a virgin Tom Collins for me?

155
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,290
Virgin. What are you? A girl?

156
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,104
Now, Dondalinger, I want some answers.

157
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,274
Very well. It's a fact,
I didn't like you, Simpson. Still don't.

158
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,075
You lie. You love me.

159
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:46,779
Whatever complex emotions I feel,
they're not why I did what I did.

160
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,814
There was another reason.

161
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:49,949

162
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,617
Jive talkin'

163
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,151
You're telling me lies

164
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,421
Jive talkin'

165
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:58,115
Homer Simpson,
what a loser!

166
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,694
Hey, what if we got everyone
to vote for him as a joke and he won?

167
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,230
Then we could laugh at him
all the way through high school...

168
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,631
...and at every reunion!

169
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,667
Go, sports!
- Go, sports!

170
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,437
Hmm.

171
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:19,078
So you see, I disposed of the ballot box
to spare your feelings.

172
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,948
You denied me my dream! So I'm angry!

173
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,584
But you did it out of kindness,
so I'm grateful.

174
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,753
I'm filled with respect
and contempt for you.

175
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,219
I... Why you...

176
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,457
Oh.

177
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,991
You are so... I hate you!

178
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,930
As principal, I did a lot of things
I'm not proud of.

179
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,167
I would steal school chalk
from my own chalkboard.

180
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,436
But I'm not sorry I rigged that election.

181
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,172
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna sit under that tree...

182
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:50,076
...and think of all the women
I could've talked to but didn't.

183
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,143
Hmm.

184
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,346
The brown-haired girl gave me a look.

185
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,048
The red head in the park
was reading a book.

186
00:11:56,148 --> 00:12:02,693
The girl at the airport upgraded my car.
Tonight, I wonder just where you are.

187
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,426
Homie, you're barely eating.

188
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:10,396
Yeah. I can actually see your hands.
They're not just a blur.

189
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,231
I don't feel much like eating.

190
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:16,035
I'll never know what would've happened
if I had been class president.

191
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,838
LUIGl: You could know if you dared.

192
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,106
Huh? Who said that?

193
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,743
In the kitchen is a man
from the old country who works for me.

194
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,411
He stirs the sauce.

195
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:29,413
They say if he stirs the sauce just right,

196
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:33,178
he can also see what might have been!

197
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,889
As a rational skeptic,
I find that hard to believe.

198
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,992
Also as a vegetarian,
I hope there's not meat in that sauce.

199
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,496
Any other orders, Mussolini?
- No. That's it.

200
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,157
Watch the sauce.
You see what I see?

201
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,502
I see a hair.
- You see too much!

202
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,662
Now watch the sauce of bubbling red.

203
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:56,156
And see the life you could've led.
- Okay.

204
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,611
COOK: Yes, I like to stir.

205
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:06,557
Your new senior class president is,

206
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,455
Homer Simpson.

207
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,694
Our president's a real loser!
- Yeah. A loser like us!

208
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,364
He proves you don't have to be popular
to have everyone like you.

209
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:22,423
Homer! Homer! Homer!
- BOTH: Homer! Homer!

210
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:26,494
ALL: Homer! Homer! Homer! Homer...

211
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,243
I would've been a winner!

212
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,746
Instead of some idiot spending
his Saturday nights...

213
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,948
...staring into a bowl of sauce!

214
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,676
Why did fate do this to me?

215
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:41,216
Ask the garlic bread.

216
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,323
Why? Why?

217
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:48,260
Hey, everyone! The stupid fat man's
talking to garlic bread!

218
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,868
Come on, stir! I must see more!

219
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,804
Homie, please.
Nothing good will come of this.

220
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:02,074
Marge, unlike CPR,
this is something I must know!

221
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:07,237
Very well. Now we must once
more stare madly into the sauce.

222
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,290
Mr. President, we need a class song,
a class motto, and a class mascot!

223
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,060
Color My World, 'Disco Sucks,'
and Butthead the goat.

224
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,764
Mr. President, do you approve
of the bailout of the French Club?

225
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,198
They're too big to fail.

226
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,601
Homer, do you have a date
for the prom yet?

227
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:33,631
Sorry. The only girl I could ever want
is right over there.

228
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,706
Debbie Pinson.

229
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,746
Hey, Debbie. Want to go to prom with me?

230
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:44,671
Well, I'm engaged to the quarterback,
but yes!

231
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,120
Forget it, Marge.

232
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,891
A girl like you could never land
a Homer Simpson.

233
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:52,958
LISA: Aha!

234
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,094
So Dad's life
would actually have been worse...

235
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,488
...because he wouldn't
have gotten together...

236
00:14:57,588 --> 00:14:58,964
...with Mom, his one true love.

237
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,209
Just keep watching the sauce, girlie.

238
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:11,453
I got the biggest lapels,
the ruffliest shirt,

239
00:15:11,553 --> 00:15:13,712
and the most beautiful girl.

240
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,812
Thank you, Homer.

241
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,617
Debbie, I forgot I have an English paper
due on Monday.

242
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,853
Would you read
To Kill a Mockingbird for me?

243
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,621
And if you could write down
how Boo Radley...

244
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,835
...fits into the southern
gothic tradition,

245
00:15:24,935 --> 00:15:25,891
that would be great.

246
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:30,241
Nobody's ever asked me
to use my head brain before.

247
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,069
Homer Simpson, class president.

248
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,071
MARGE: Oh, my God! He's talking to me!

249
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,240
A lot of great things
have happened to me lately.

250
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,109
But they're nothing
compared to meeting you.

251
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:48,374
May I have this dance?
- Only if it lasts forever.

252
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:54,687
Homer Simpson!
I was gonna let you get to fifth base!

253
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,556
It would've been something
you told your grandchildren about!

254
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:01,360
Sorry, Debbie.
I hope you can find happiness without me.

255
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,444
Who wants a cheerleader on the rebound?

256
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,866
I do! Right.

257
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,240
I can hardly believe this is real.

258
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:21,206
Marge, the way I feel about you
is as real and lasting as my hairline.

259
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,552
Who's that side of beef
munching on our sister?

260
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:31,667
I don't know. But in this reality
I am not gay. Hubba hubba!

261
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,558
HOMER: Sweet dreams.

262
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:41,166
Young man, you have the noble bearing
of the Barbarian leader Vercingetorix.

263
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,168
Thank you, mysterious weirdo.

264
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:47,806
Tell me, what student government office
do you hold? Secretary? Treasurer?

265
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,242
Dare I say secretary-treasurer?

266
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,944
I'm class president.

267
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:56,413
Hot dog!
Say, how would you like to work for me?

268
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,425
Sir, we could start him off in Sector 7G.
- 7G?

269
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:03,455
Let the Lennys and the Carls of the world
waste their wretched lives...

270
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,658
...in that testicle-shriveling
torture chamber.

271
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:09,717
Son, you'll be working in sector 6F!

272
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,064
LISA: Aha!

273
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,066
So Dad's life would've been the same!

274
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,368
He would've married Mom
and worked for Mr. Burns.

275
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,803
It would've been a push.

276
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:21,173
Can you keep her quiet?
- Not even when she's snorkeling.

277
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,876
I was describing beautiful fish, Bart!

278
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,489
How you doing, Dad?

279
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:40,059
I can't complain. And I never do.

280
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,984
Thanks for letting me live
in your guesthouse.

281
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,367
Honey, I'm home!

282
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,238
Where are the kids?

283
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:56,568
You used protection. We never had any.

284
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:03,015
Well, that's what's missing. Our lives
would be horrible without the kids.

285
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:06,518
Yes. That must be it.
This is the best of all possible worlds!

286
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,886
Blah-blah-blah.

287
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,366
I want to live in the sauce!

288
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,994
If you could live in the sauce, don't you
think I would live in the sauce?

289
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:24,870
How long has he been there?
- I don't know. But he's algae-fying.

290
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,962
Homie, please come inside?
- Okay.

291
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:33,278
Dad, we need to have a talk.
- I get it.

292
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,115
You're all gonna try to convince me...

293
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,282
...that my life is great
just like it is, right?

294
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:40,753
Are you kidding? We couldn't even
convince you that Bruce Wayne is Batman!

295
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,155
Come on! That millionaire playboy?

296
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,424
He's too busy socializing
at cocktail parties...

297
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,726
...and managing the affairs
of the Wayne Foundation!

298
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,795
Don't open this one again.

299
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,064
Why does he think
Alfred's friends with Batman?

300
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,499
Just stop!

301
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,902
Dad, we think the sauce had it all wrong.

302
00:18:57,002 --> 00:19:00,402
Look who thinks he's smarter than sauce.

303
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:06,045
Sweetheart, I think you'd feel better
after we take a little walk.

304
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,846
HOMER: Why would you bring me here?

305
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,149
It's like bringing Richard Nixon
to the Watergate,

306
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,384
or Kevin Costner to Waterworld.

307
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,484
Really?

308
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,989
My own plaque!

309
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,582
And one for Vice President Butthead!
Cool!

310
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,463
Is that why you brought me here, spirits?

311
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,799
Yep. In the future, people
will look at this...

312
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:30,669
...and they'll say,
'Whoever he was, he must've mattered.'

313
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,771
I guess that would be nice.

314
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:36,041
Pardon me. Can my son
have his picture taken with you?

315
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,141
Really? Sure.

316
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:44,116
Dad, do you think
I could be elected class president?

317
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:47,701
Well, we can't all be Homer Simpson, son.

318
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,719
Thanks, guys.

319
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,357
Hey, was there another plaque
here before?

320
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,582
Plaques come, plaques go.

321
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,332
Now let's get something to eat!

322
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:03,094
How about Italian?
- God, no!

323
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,736
I hear there's a Korean barbecue place...

324
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,905
...where the beef spells out
the date of your death.

325
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,300
Whoo! That sounds like fun!
