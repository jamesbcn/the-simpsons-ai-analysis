00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,848
a nerdy little fourth-grader.

348
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,571
And now
you're an emotionally
crippled mini-Hulk.

349
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,085
What girl
wouldn't want that?

350
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,924
Do you think
Lisa might see that,

351
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,286
now that she's got
nothing else?

352
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,407
I guess so.

353
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,280
Booyah! Time to strike
while the iron is sad!

354
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,280
All right.
Three hours
to blast my quads.

355
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,646
Lisa. Lisa. Lisa.

356
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,042
Bart, what's wrong?
You seem distracted.

357
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,851
Oh, I was just thinking
about Milhouse and Lisa.

358
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,491
Mmm-hmm. What are you
thinking about now?

359
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,847
Hey, that rundown
old house looks familiar.

360
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,727
That's where Doc Frink
used to live.

361
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,049
(SIGHS) I never had
this problem with
Todd Flanders.

362
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,481
This machine lets us
look into the future.

363
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,403
Wouldn't that
be romantic?

364
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,403
I'll tell you
what would
be romantic.

365
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,165
Making love for
the first time.

366
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,608
Totally. Right after
I fiddle with
these dials and levers.

367
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,045
(BEEPING)

368
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,161
(GRUNTS)

369
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,288
You know,
I was thinking
of taking

370
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,840
a poetry class
at the community college.

371
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,046
Forget it.

372
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,442
I had to sell
all my marrow
to pay the light bill.

373
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,127
I didn't have
much marrow.

374
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,646
I can't let
that happen.
I gotta go.

375
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,882
Listen, Bart, if you
leave me now,

376
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,486
I can guarantee
one thing about
your future.

377
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,891
I won't be in it.

378
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,805
Not going to Yale
isn't the end
of the world.

379
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,962
Yeah, I'm starting
to see that.

380
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,686
No, I mean,
you're screwed.

381
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,240
Your only hope
is to clutch at straws!

382
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,927
Straws who've
always loved you.

383
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,047
Really?

384
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,247
Really.

385
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,244
Can I kiss you?

386
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,921
Um, have you eaten
onions lately?

387
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,891
No. And it's really hard
'cause I'm on
an all-onion diet.

388
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,608
Uh... Well, okay.
I guess this is my destiny.

389
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,966
(SCREAMS)

390
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,724
What are you doing?

391
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,643
Keeping Lisa from
destroying her life.

392
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,927
Come on,
let her destroy it.

393
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,170
(GRUNTS)Oh!

394
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,849
Lenny, Carl,
can you pull me out?

395
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,610
Sorry, we're ghosts now.

396
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,842
Our spirits live
in those two trees.

397
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,163
Or maybe we're alive
and we just feel
like jerking you around.

398
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,208
Or maybe
we're one of each.

399
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,281
(BOTH LAUGH)

400
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,481
(SIGHS)

401
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,927
Look, I'm not
taking the scholarship.

402
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,889
You're the one
who deserves
to go to Yale.

403
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,203
Aw! That's so noble.
But what about Jenda?

404
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,205
Hey, I'm waiting
till I find a girl
who likes me for me.

405
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,722
And you will
at the age of 83.

406
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,564
You die
one minute later.

407
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,722
And my brain
is put in a...

408
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,767
Pauper's grave.

409
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,490
Well, Bart,
I really appreciate

410
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,040
what you're
going to do for me.
Mmm.

411
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,481
But what happens
to our parents?

412
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,566
Marge, I thought
you'd never take me back
after what I did to Krusty.

413
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,642
You mean
get beaten up
by him?

414
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,000
Exactly.

415
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,085
And I'll admit,
it is kind of romantic
under the sea.

416
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,367
You don't know the half of it.

417
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,006
(CHUCKLES)

418
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,480
Oh, this sucks.
I want to see
Vice President Cletus.

419
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,248
You want me to attend
the funeral of
the Sultan of Brunei?

420
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,608
Well, I would
consider it my honor.

421
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:33,007
Hey, Brandine,
pack my evening britches.
We's going to Brunei.

422
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,281
(SHUSHING)
