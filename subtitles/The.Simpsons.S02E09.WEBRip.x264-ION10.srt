In preparing for this debate,
I did a little research,

and I discovered
a startling thing.

249
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,999
There was violence in the past

were invented.

00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,764

Tremendous violence,
many people killed!

{\an8}Well Kent, to me, the hijinks

stuff like that.

267

no professional objection

268

269
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,917
{\an8}No, not at all. In fact, one
of my guilty little pleasures

270
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,092

bucket of buttered popcorn,

they may be, are evil.

they probably shouldn't.
