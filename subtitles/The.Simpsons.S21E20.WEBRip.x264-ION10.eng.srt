{\an8}Ooh,yeah!

34
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:28,423
{\an8}Duffman is here
to refill your beers!

35
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,705
{\an8}Okay. Thank you.

36
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,838
{\an8}Now, for the only thing better
than Duff.

37
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,466
{\an8}-(overlapping chatter)
-Better than Duff?

38
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,182
{\an8}Free Duff stuff!

39
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,262
{\an8}-Oh, yeah!
-Oh!

40
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,557
{\an8}Now, who wants...
beer cozies?!

41
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,942
{\an8}A shirt that says "Yo!"

42
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,938
{\an8}Sassy seat cushions!

43
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,650
{\an8}And flash drives for your PC
so you can take your data and

44
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,943
{\an8}back it up!

00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,647
{\an8}-Whoa!
-I need some of that.

00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,817
{\an8}And now, Duffman
has a dinner date

47
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,526
{\an8}with his estranged
daughter.

48
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,656
{\an8}Must not bring up why she
dropped out of college.

49
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,504
{\an8}It's too sad!

50
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,789
{\an8}Huh. Huh. Hey.
Ha! Ha!

51
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,883
{\an8}Guess what company

52
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,169
{\an8}had a giveaway at
Moe's last night?

53
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,214
{\an8}No, I won't.

54
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,756
{\an8}Keep guessing.

55
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,721
{\an8}What's it say, boy?

56
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,051
{\an8}Responsibly.

57
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,546
{\an8}Oh!

58
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,970
{\an8}Kid, you've
been staring

59
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,676
{\an8}at these gelatin
desserts for 15 minutes.

60
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,137
{\an8}Pick one!

61
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,347
{\an8}It's so hard to decide.

62
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,107
{\an8}Is the yellow one lemon
or pineapple?

63
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,570
{\an8}It's your
pet canary.

64
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,570
{\an8}Now scram!

65
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,702
{\an8}(groans)

66
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,608
{\an8}-Hey.
-Haw haw!

67
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,527
{\an8}You're a spaz!

68
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,414
{\an8}That's not true.

69
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,741
{\an8}First of all, Milhouse fell
because you tripped him.

70
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,247
{\an8}Secondly, spaz is short
for spastic diplegic,

71
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,830
{\an8}someone who suffers from a
serious medical condition.

72
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,746
{\an8}Thirdly, your "haw haw,"
through overuse,

73
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,586
{\an8}has lost its power.

74
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,171
{\an8}Wow.

75
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,376
{\an8}I bow before your logic.

76
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,546
{\an8}(grunts)

77
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,604
{\an8}(groaning)

78
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,641
{\an8}Excuse me.

79
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,183
{\an8}I couldn't help but notice
how logically you argue.

80
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,597
{\an8}(laughs)

81
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,645
{\an8}Well, I am one: flattered,
and two: intrigued.

82
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,810
{\an8}Lisa Simpson.

83
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,148
{\an8}Ms. Dubinsky.

84
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,612
{\an8}I'd like to invite you
to join our debate team.

85
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,703
{\an8}I didn't know
we had a debate team.

86
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,778
{\an8}Well, it's the one
extracurricular activity

87
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,784
{\an8}that can't be cut, because
it requires no equipment.

88
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,157
{\an8}We're low on funding,

89
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,913
{\an8}so Ralph Wiggum will be
standing in as your lectern.

90
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,169
{\an8}I'm a furniture!

91
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,415
{\an8}And that is why

92
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,263
{\an8}hybrid car buyers
should be given rebates

93
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,799
{\an8}paid for by taxes
on hamburgers.

94
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,513
{\an8}(blows horn)

95
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,343
{\an8}Thank you, Lisa.

96
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,177
{\an8}Excuse me.

97
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,221
{\an8}The podiums
are needed

98
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,724
{\an8}in the art
room as easels.

99
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:46,175
{\an8}BOTH:
Yay!

100
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,767
{\an8}Megan, cross-examination.

101
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,442
{\an8}What if someone's driving an
old, but functioning, car?

102
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,691
{\an8}Wouldn't the
carbon required

103
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,533
{\an8}to create a new hybrid
exceed the savings in gas?

104
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,739
{\an8}Initially yes, but...

105
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,358
{\an8}And isn't most electricity
in the United States

106
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,616
{\an8}ultimately derived
from the burning of coal?

107
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,658
{\an8}Currently. However,
solar and wind are...

108
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,832
{\an8}The sun and the breeze-- the
two things you know a lot about.

109
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,962
{\an8}Right, Blondie?

110
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:07,868
{\an8}Blondie?!

111
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,576
{\an8}Like, totally.

112
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,626
{\an8}Why don't we get a
bitchin' new perm

113
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,669
{\an8}with daddy's
credit card?

114
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,212
{\an8}(laughter)

115
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,755
{\an8}First of all,

116
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,418
{\an8}my father no longer has
any functioning credit cards.

117
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,968
{\an8}Secondly, how dare
you refer to...

118
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,471
{\an8}-Ooh, you can
count to two.
-Aah.

119
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,263
{\an8}Do you need some
ice on your head?

120
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,677
-(laughter)
-(gasps)

121
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,715
I... I...

122
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,768
(horn blows)

123
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,771
The winner by a hair--

124
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,233
a brown hair-- Megan!

125
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,444
Ooh!

126
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,694
<i>Sir, that hollow mountain</i>
<i>in Nevada</i>

127
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,895
<i>that was supposed</i>
<i>to hold a million years</i>

128
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,736
<i>of nuclear waste is full.</i>

129
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,531
Did they jump on the pile
to smoosh it down?

130
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,195
<i>It went down in one place</i>
<i>and up in another.</i>

131
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,495
<i>We need somewhere else</i>
<i>to dispose of this plutonium.</i>

132
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,868
Eh, just find the biggest idiot
on our payroll

133
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,616
and slip it in his bag.

134
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,878
(humming)

135
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,711
BURNS:
Ooh!

136
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,756
That's a bingo.

137
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,760
Mmm. Good mac
and cheese.

138
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:02,973
I've had better.

139
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:06,312
Down at the
train station.

140
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,849
I'll have to check it out
sometime.

141
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,562
{\an8}Mmm!

142
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,022
{\an8}The best mac and
cheese <i>I've </i>ever had

143
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,983
{\an8}is at a bowling
alley in Ogdenville.

144
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,523
Mm, I am pretty full.

145
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,316
Bread crumbs on the top.

146
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,030
I'm on my way!

147
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,700
That bag--
surely it's attended.

148
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,752
Unattended bag!

149
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,828
(screaming)

150
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,832
All panic!

151
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,495
(screaming and shouting)

152
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,843
So, what do you think?

153
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,933
I think we're
gonna blow it up

154
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,139
and let the bleeding heart
liberals ask questions later.

155
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,809
Well, now, why can't it be
blown up by a woman of color?

156
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,020
Five, four.

157
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,230
No time for a full countdown.

158
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,190
Ooh, it's dinner time!

159
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,444
(grunts, sighs)

160
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,185
(humming)

161
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,985
This just in.

162
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,454
The suspicious bag detonated at
Springfield Union Station today

163
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,905
contained deadly plutonium,

164
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,535
which can only mean one thing--
a terrorist plot.

165
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,043
Enough radioactivity
was released

166
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,504
to create 17 Hulks
and a Spider-Man.

167
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,585
Here's an artist's conception.

168
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,380
Quite disturbing.

169
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,014
(excited, overlapping chatter)

170
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:23,881
(gavel bangs)

171
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:24,876
I admit it.

172
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,297
Everything I've said

173
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,716
about terrorism till now
was fear-mongering.

174
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,925
But today,
I monger the truth.

175
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,885
To protect our city
from all future bombings,

176
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,436
dirty, clean, dive or carpet,

177
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,481
we have hired
an outside consultant

178
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,074
from London,
England.

179
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,029
Does he have
a cute accent?

180
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,280
(with English accent):
Why don't you be the judge,
young lady?

181
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,862
Ooh, he sounds just
like Paddington Bear!

182
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,828
My name is Nigel Bakerbutcher.

183
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,078
(whirring)

184
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,619
Sleepy London town.

185
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:55,002
<i>Once upon a time,</i>
<i>the only problem we had here</i>

186
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,081
<i>was from overzealous</i>
<i>Cockney flower sellers.</i>

187
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:57,996
Flowers, guv'nor?

188
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,344
A pretty for
your buttonhole?

189
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,499
'Ello, 'ello, 'ello.

190
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,706
(men muttering)

191
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,706
But in London
of the 21st Century,

192
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,878
the watchword is vigilance.

193
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:10,507
<i>London is now ringed</i>
<i>by the most comprehensive array</i>

194
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,176
<i>of surveillance cameras</i>
<i>mankind has ever seen.</i>

195
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,863
(murmuring)

196
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,367
Excuse me.

197
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,079
Is this what the framers
of the Constitution would want?

198
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,540
Well, I'm Wally of
Wally's Framers,

199
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,500
and this is exactly
what I want.

200
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,751
How many personal freedoms
are we willing to give up

201
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,344
in the name of security?

202
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,839
(chuckles)

203
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,300
That blonde girl thinks
she's smart, like us dark hairs.

204
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,682
Again with the blonde!

205
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,929
Why in the world
would the color of the hair

206
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,812
on someone's head
have anything to do

207
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,559
with the intelligence within?

208
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,730
Yeah, you're
so right.

209
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,599
I'm smart, too.

210
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:02,766
I got Joe to promise to leave
his wife when I turn 50.

211
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,227
Eh, uh, yes.

212
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:08,607
Now, all in favor
of these cameras say cheese.

213
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,156
ALL (except Lisa):
Cheese!

214
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,449
Those opposed say,
"I hate America."

215
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,374
I ha...

216
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,832
Oh, wait.

217
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,162
Oh.

218
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,206
Motion carries.

219
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,670
Next up: motion to limit
terms of city officials.

220
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,592
All in favor say,
"I have sex with animals."

221
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,091
I <i>do </i>have sex with animals,

222
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,434
but I am not in favor
of term limits.

223
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:31,965
Mm-hmm.

224
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:37,426
Lisa, I know kids
have been making fun
of your blonde hair,

225
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,977
so I got you this book

226
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,190
from the Being Different
section of the bookstore.

227
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,900
Hmm?

228
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,901
"Sally Circle was eating donuts
and Ovaltine

229
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,324
when her father came in
with terrible news."

230
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,823
We're moving to
Rectangu-Land!

231
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,026
Round up the family
and let's roll!

232
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,786
-(mocking laughter)
-LISA:
"Everyone was mean to Sally.

233
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,788
She was too well-rounded.

234
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,500
She felt cornered.

235
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,330
They wouldn't let her play
four-square

236
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,575
or invite her
to the box social.

237
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,708
The end."

238
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:08,134
That's a rather
unambitious book.

239
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,554
I want a camera on
every light pole.

240
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,683
I want two hidden cameras
there, open camera there.

241
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,590
Hidden. Hidden.

242
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,548
(echoing):
Hidden.

243
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,394
Hidden.

244
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,643
Cluster! Right there! Yes!

245
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,895
Um, you ain't gonna
like what you see.

246
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,059
KRUSTY:
Did you hear about the blonde
who couldn't make ice?

247
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,817
<i>-She lost the recipe.</i>
<i>-(laughter)</i>

248
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,900
You know why it takes longer
to build a blonde snowman?

249
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,527
You have to hollow out the head.

250
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,243
(laughter)

251
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,038
(Bart laughs)

252
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,449
He sure nailed you, Lis.

253
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,207
You're blond, too.

254
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,959
Blonde <i>guys </i>aren't dumb.

255
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,250
They're evil.

256
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,253
Like in <i>The Karate Kid</i>
and World War II.

257
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,344
All right, boys.

258
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,843
Let's see the dark
underbelly of our fair burg.

259
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,353
Okay, we got a litterbug

260
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,943
on F-6, double homicide
in progress on Q-20...

261
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,770
A woman sunbathing topless
on R-15!

262
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,606
Uh, Chief, I think
we got a misuse

263
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,441
of police equipment on ZZ-99.

264
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,146
Killjoy.

265
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,872
Gas station customer
washing windshield

266
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,700
without buying gas.

267
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,655
Girl using Wite-Out
as nail polish.

268
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,536
Oh, man, this is hard.

269
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,463
Hey, did you get that guy
who was parading around naked?

270
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,252
He was just jogging
in a tan sweat suit, Chief.

271
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,257
Are you sure?
I thought I saw his...

272
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,669
That was a fanny pack,
worn on the front.

273
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,628
-But there was a...
-Water bottle...

274
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,467
-But it was...
-Leaking.

275
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,841
That's it! That's it!

276
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,677
I can't take another minute
of these stupid screens!

277
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,934
Go-Go find
some concerned citizens

278
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,476
to pick up the slack.

279
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,889
Well, how many should I get?

280
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,807
Uh, well, we've got, uh,
eight chairs, so...

281
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,147
Oh, no, wait.

282
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,071
Put one chair in my office
facing my desk,

283
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,820
so-so I'll seem
like a meetings guy.

284
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:53,992
Yeah. Oh, uh...

285
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,240
Oh, have a seat.

286
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,451
Uh, I'll be with you
in one minute. Yeah.

287
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,821
Ah, that's a new low.

288
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,580
We have chosen you
to help out,

289
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,581
because you are all
that rare combination.

290
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,544
Prying, but not pervy.

291
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,044
(polite laughter)

292
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,625
Now just follow a little formula
called P.B. and J.:

293
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:15,262
Peer at the monitor,
Be judgmental, and Jot it down.

294
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,841
One way to remember
that is A.B.C.:

295
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,677
Always Be Considering
P.B. and J.

296
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,353
But the single most important
rule is the four A's:

297
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,062
Always Act According to A.B.C.

298
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,648
Uh-oh.

299
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:31,821
What is it, Ned?

300
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,439
I've got two teens
in a public park

301
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,816
goin' at it like
a couple of gibbons

302
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,152
in the back seat of Noah's Ark!

303
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,737
Should we inform
the Chief?

304
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,162
Hmm, maybe.

305
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,330
But I feel a little like
I'm the Tom Voyeur

306
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,329
to these Huckleberry
Sinners.

307
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,661
Or you could correct
the behavior yourself

308
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,786
with our Nag-a-sonic speakers.

309
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,463
Oi! Snogging people!

310
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,923
<i>What the hell was that?!</i>

311
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,632
Tongues where I can see them,
please.

312
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,383
I ain't lettin' you touch me
with somebody watchin'.

313
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,965
Come on, baby, it's
just a voice.

314
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,681
Don't push it, Kearney.

315
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,891
-I'm Jimbo!
-Oh, great.

316
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,102
Make me look easy
in front of the voice.

317
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,852
But you are easy!

318
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,154
Don't be ashamed
of what you are!

319
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,558
Shauna...

320
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,766
I've gone from lookie-loo
to talkie-too.

321
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,858
Excuse me,
that's your salad fork.

322
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,244
That Wi-Fi's
for hotel guests only.

323
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,831
What's the matter, sir, too cool
to sing "Happy Birthday?"

324
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,288
Isn't this great, Marge?

325
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,658
We're like Jiminy Cricket
for the whole ding-dang town.

326
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,166
A half-man, half-bug that knows
what's best for everybody.

327
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,539
Mm-hmm.

328
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,085
I don't know.

329
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,999
I'm starting to think
we're prying too much

330
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,587
into people's lives.

331
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,842
And this room isn't really
the best place

332
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,264
for Maggie to hang out.

333
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,892
That's not <i>Sesame Street,</i>

334
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,219
that's a gay bar.

335
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,314
(dance music playing)

336
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,139
(grunts)

337
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,194
Although I guess

338
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,729
this would teach her
sharing and caring,

339
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,653
but... we're going home.

340
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,958
(sinister laugh)

341
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,709
Dye! Dye! Dye!

342
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,962
(maniacally laughing)

343
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,295
<i>Tomorrow's forecast is...</i>

344
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,920
Okay, place your bets.

345
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,797
-Partly cloudy.
-Partly sunny.

346
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,434
Golf ball-sized hail!

347
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,351
<i>A chance of severe thunderstorms</i>

348

Hey, weren't these

353
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,529
to keep America's enemies
from blowin' up our homeland?

354
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,689
<i>Well, sir, how many times</i>

355
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:41,738

356
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,321
Zero times.

357
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,865
Mm-hmm!

358
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,949
Now I'm gonna go (clicks tongue)

So, you like to watch, huh?

Well, take a look at this!

379
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:29,912
Huh?

380
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,044
Hmm.

392
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,355
Experimenting
with my butt.

393
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,072
(chuckles)
My little Einstein.

394
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,825
Welcome to Chaos Corners,
the Pleasure Patch,

395
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,457
Satan's Triangle--

396
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,553
the one place in town no
cameras can see you,

397
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,799
and no laws can
touch you.

398
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,143
Oh, yeah, that stopped
the kicking.

399
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,394
Inspiration Point looks
pretty uninspired.

400
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,897
All's quiet in Murder Town.

401
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:41,898
Yep, Springfield is cleaner
than the Lord's hand towels.

402
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,612
Sour ball, take me away!

403
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,863
Mm-mm-mmm.

404
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,356
Mmm! Mm-mmm... mmm.

405
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,487
(cheering, laughter)

406
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,623

407
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,120
(tires screeching)

408
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,000
Another tie.

409
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,174
Followed by three hours
of parachute repacking.

410
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,298
(gasps)

411
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,171
Koo-koo-roo!
Koo-koo-roo!

412
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,506
(gasps)
A phony bird call?!

413
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:09,762
That means Marge is coming!

414
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,053
Everyone, act legal!

415
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,006
(jaunty, old-fashioned
melody playing)

416
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,649
(humming)

417
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:26,531
Homer, Maggie has to wear
that clown mask for Halloween.

418
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,900
What's going on?

419
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,697
Well, uh...

420
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,530
the one place the cameras
can't see is right here
in our backyard,

421
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,445
so I'm charging people to
do whatever they want.

422
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,664
Isn't that wonderful?

423
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,454
I don't see what's so wonderful.

424
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:41,078
Remember how you wanted me to
get that expensive operation?

425
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,536
Well, now I can
afford a motorcycle!

426
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:47,337
Ever hear of the expression
"Not in my backyard"?

427
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,343
Well... that!

428
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,797
Nothin'.

429
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,595
Nothin'. Somethin'.

430
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,309
I don't want to get Homer
in trouble,

431
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,179
but it's just plain wrong
to use that blind spot

432
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,477
to turn our backyard into
a Mecca of misdemeanors!

433
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,022
(gasps) Blind spot?!

434
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,815
Mecca?!

435
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,701
Rod, hold up Daddy's shaving
mirror out the window, would ya?

436
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,702
(overlapping chatter)

437
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,367
I see you now.

438
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,294
Rod, you and Todd
stay in the house.

439
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,962
Todd's not in the house.

440
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,461
(gerbils squealing)

441
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,003
No!

442
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,887
And that's why school uniforms
should not be mandatory.

443
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,260
Lisa, rebuttal?

444
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,307
(all gasp)

445
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,193
Dressing in uniforms
is a good thing.

446
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:47,861
If everyone looks the same,
it levels the playing field.

447
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,691
Hmm, very smart.

448
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,777
-That's well-reasoned.
-A true brunette.

449
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,282
It's better to just fit in
with the crowd.

450
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,704
-She's as bright as
her hair is dark!
-So smart!

451
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,783
Great point!

452
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,617
Oh, I can't go on!

453
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,042
This rebuttal is a sham!

454
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,910
(all gasp)

455
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,206
You aren't being persuaded

456
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,459
by the content of my argument.

457
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,000
You're being convinced
by the color of my hair!

458
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,495
-Well, that-- that's absurd!
-Ridiculous!

459
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,626
Although her brown hair makes
a persuasive case.

460
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,633
Well guess what?
I am not a brunette!

461
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,545
I'm a blonde!

462
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,474
(screams)

463
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,641
Roots!

464
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,049
(sighs)

465
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,967
We must rid ourselves
of these outdated clichés.

466
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,847
Not all blondes are dumb!

467
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,524
Not all fat people are jolly.

468
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,153
Would you be jolly

469
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,770
if you thought Comic-Con
was moving to Anaheim?

470
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,937
And not all old people
are bad drivers.

471
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,662
This building
cut me off!

472
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,949
(horn honking)

473
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,041
(gunshot)

474
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,999
(crackling, whistling)

475
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,835
Who wants feet steak?

476
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,288
ALL:
Me! Me!

477
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,548
Over here!

478
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,219
De-meat those feet!

479
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,378
Oh, no! I don't have
to listen to you.

480
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,047
If I'm not on camera,
you can't see me!

481
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,847
I'm standin' right here!

482
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,850
Everyone in this town
is sick and tired

483
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,522
of you looking over
their shoulder.

484
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,520
"Don't leave your sprinklers
on in the rain!

485
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,402
Don't burn that pile of
ventriloquist dummies!"

486
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,860
Oh, but you promised!

487
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,020
Later. Later.

488
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,278
But, neighbor, why did you
have to do this?

489
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,490
I've tattled this town
into a paradise!

490
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,285
This used to be just
a little part of me.

491
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,370
You see, Ned, your
citywide nagging

492
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,575
compressed all of our
town's misbehavior

493
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,996
into one small place.

494
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:33,165
Creating a glittering diamond
of super evil.

495
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,295
(sighs)

496
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,631
I guess I did create this.

497
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,336
Like God created the devil.

498
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,886
God created the devil?

499
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,549
Finally, He did something cool.

500
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,887
(sighs)

501
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,352
Oh, I never wanted to turn
into Big Brother.

502
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,193
I just wanted
to be little sister,

503
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,098
tattlin' on everyone so the town
would be a nicer place.

504
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,648
Well, if you ask me,
you were trying to play God.

505
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,032
(gasps)

506
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,318
That's the worst sin of all,
for some reason.

507
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,992
What can I do
to make things right?

508
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,360
You can help me take
out those cameras.

509
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:04,196
Neighbor, we got
some work to do.

510
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,746
(grunting)

511
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,579
Yes!

512
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,294
(glass shattering)

513

(gunfire)

514
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,764
So, sadly, the most popular
reality show in England

515
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,307
is no more.

516
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,944
I'll miss that Ralph Wiggum.

517
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,019
Reminds me of my boy.

518
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:35,864
Oh, Mummy, my cat's breath
smells like cat food.
