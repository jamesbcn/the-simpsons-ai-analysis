62
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,710

69
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:52,734

There's something
I think you should know.

73
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,830
Homer, you have
a half brother.

74
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,909
-A half brother?
-Uh-huh.

75
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:09,044
It all happened when
I was courting your mother.

76
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:12,253
<i>I was checking out the skirts</i>
<i>at the local carnival</i>

<i>A year later, the carnival</i>

<i>and she had a little</i>
<i>surprise for me.</i>

83
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,772
We left the baby
at the Shelbyville Orphanage,

84
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,725
and I never saw him again.

85
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,647
<i>A year later, I married</i>

86

Abe, I want Homer to grow up
respecting his father.

87
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,866

that carnival incident.

88
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,713
-Okay.
-Promise you won't tell him.

89
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,368

90
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,376

This makes me feel
special, Dad.

94
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,301
Since I'm the one you kept,
that must mean you really love me.

95
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,724
Hmm... interesting theory.

96
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,183

I don't care what it takes.

100
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,896
So, any idea where
this bastard lives?

101
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,065
-Bart!
-His parent's aren't married, are they?

102
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,704
It's the correct word,
isn't it?

103
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,070

00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,378

-Can you tell me his name?
-Hmm...

123
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,330
According to our records,
a Mr. and Mrs. Powell adopted your brother

124
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,923
and named him Herbert.

125
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:17,378
Herbert! Herbert Powell!
Great. Where can I find him?

126
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,960
I'm sorry. I'm not allowed
to release that information.

00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,598
After all, your brother
could be anywhere.

131
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,520
-Even Detroit.
-I know he could be anywhere!

132
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,651
That's why I want you
to narrow it down! Please!

133
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,269
You know, Mr. Simpson, if you ask me,
the city of <i>brotherly</i> love

134
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,488
isn't Philadelphia,

Well, if you ask me,
changing the subject

136

142
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,875

-Just take it and tell me!

143
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,091

152
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,873

Herbert Powells in Detroit.

153
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:38,253
-Nothing.
-Well, you want to try that H. Powell?

154
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,882
"H"! Of course!

155
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,249
That <i>could</i> stand for Herbert.

156
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,796
It's a long shot, but...

157
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,633

-Hello?

158
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,797
-<i>Is this H. Powell of Detroit, Michigan? </i>
-Yeah.

159
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,097

stand for Herbert?

160
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,141
Yeah.

Wahoo! The "H"
stands for Herbert!

162
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,391
Herb, were you adopted?

163
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,938
Yeah.

164
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,231

165
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,355
How did you know that?

166
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,361
Because...

167
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,653
I'm your baby brother, Homer.

168
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,907

170
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,447
Hey, hey!
Knock it off, I'm here!

171
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,044
<i>I'm just silent because</i>

172
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,659
<i>-of the emotion involved.</i>
-Oh, sorry.

173
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,406
Homer, I think
we need to get together.

174
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,538
Okay, brother.

175
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,924
Grab the next plane
to Springfield.

176
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,001
We got a couch
that folds out.

177
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,165
I'll tell you what.

178
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,843
Why don't you come here?

179
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:34,008
-BART, LISA: Are we there yet?
-HOMER: Just a little furth--

180
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,346
-Are we there yet?
-Just a little fur--

181
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,231
-Are we there yet?
-Just a little further!

182
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,018
Bart! Lisa!
If you don't behave,

183
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,061
we'll turn this car
right around and go home.

184
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,145
But, Marge,
I want to see my brother.

185
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,691
Oh, for God's sakes, Homer,
it's an empty threat.

186
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,485
-Oh. D'oh!
-(siren wailing)

187
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,406
Did you know you were going--

188
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,452
Oh, sorry, sir.

189
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,946
I didn't know it was you.

190
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,077
That's okay.
Carry on.

191
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,084
See the way I handled that,
Marge? (slurps)

192
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,798
Wow! What are you doing here?

193
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,382
What does it look like?

194
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,715
-D'oh!
-(laughing)

195
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,350
D'oh. Every day we're losing ground
to the Japanese, and I wanna know why?

196
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,225
Unfair trade practices?

197
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,402
Mushy-headed one-worlders
in Washington?

198
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:29,111
-Some sort of Gypsy curse?
-I'm tired of excuses.

199
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,863
Why did I ever hire you
Harvard deadheads?

200
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,195
Because you went there, sir.

201
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,370
Yeah, but Mommy and Daddy
didn't pay <i>my</i> way.

202
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,699
I had to work my way through
washing your dishes

203
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,195
and scrubbing your toilets.

204
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,157
Oh, yeah,
now I remember you.

205
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,037
Have you come up with a name
for our new economy model?

206
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,424
You're gonna love this,
chief--

207
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,040
The Persephone.

208
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,207
-Persephone?
-Mm-hmm.

209
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,046
What the hell kind of name
is Persephone?

210
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,051
She was the Greek goddess
of spring and rebirth.

211
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,844
-D'oh!
-And get this sir.

212
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,557
She was carried off to Hades
by the king of the underworld.

213
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,388
While there,
she ate six pomegranates--

214
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,733
People don't want cars

215
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,888
named after hungry,
old Greek broads!

216
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,228
They want names like Mustang

217
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,404
and Cheetah--

218
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,731
vicious animal names.

219
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,947
The problem with you guys is
you've forgotten your roots!

220
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,739
You? What are your roots?

221
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,412
Well, I guess you could say
they extend

222
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,740
to when the Anglos met
the Saxons.

223
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,576
-(laughter)
-In other words, when white met bread.

224
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,622
Sir, we'd love to know
what your roots are,

225
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,116
and what they have
to teach us.

226
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,287
(sighs)
I have no roots.

227
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,746
All I know is that...

228
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,877
I'm just...

229
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,384
a lonely guy.

230
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,256
ALL:
Aww!

231
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,103
-What's he so upset about?
-Good Lord.

232
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,889
Marge, this can't be
the right address.

233
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,154
Hello, in there.

234
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,228
Homer?

235
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,151
Herb?

236
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,982
-You look just like--
-You look just like--

237
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,198
-Except you got a little less--
-Except you got a little more--

238
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,318
-And a little more--
-And a little less--

239
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,615
-God, I feel so--
-God, I feel so--

240
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,619
-Homer!
-Herbert!

241
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,372
-Homer!
-Oh, Herbert.

242
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,334
Welcome to my home, brother.

243
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,924
HOMER: Holy moly,
the bastard's rich!

244
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,380
Herb, allow me
to introduce my family.

245
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,801
This is my wife, Marge.

246
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,089
-Hello.
-Hello!

247
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,393
-You old dog! She's gorgeous.
-Thank you.

248
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,928
And our three children--
Bart, Lisa and Maggie.

249
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,683
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, Mr. Powell.

250
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,805
All born in wedlock?

251
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,731
Yeah, though the boy
was a close call.

252
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,350
Hmm. So, Lisa,

253
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,897
are you
the little hell-raiser

254
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,020
your father
told me about?

255
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,027
No, sir, I can assure you,
I'm not.

256
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,859
I'm the little
hell-raiser, sir.

257
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,954
Would you like
to hold the baby, Herb?

258
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,359
Oh, I'm afraid
I wouldn't know how.

259
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,447
Oh, what's to know?

260
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,583
-Just dive in. Catch!
-(inhales)

261
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,751
God, that new-baby smell.

262
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,581
Homer, you're the richest man
I know.

263
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,037
I feel the same about you.

264
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,458
While you're here, I want you
to make yourselves right at home.

265
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,008
Any time you're hungry,
anytime day or night,

266
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,593
Cook will make you
anything you want.

267
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,758
-Even pork chops?
-Absolutely.

268
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,097
We have a tennis court,
a swimming pool, a screening room.

269
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,983
If I want pork chops
even in the middle of the night,

270
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,481
your guy will fry them up?

271
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,483
Sure. That's what
he's paid for.

272
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,105
Now, if you need towels,
laundry, maids--

273
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:18,452
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Let me see if I got this straight.

274
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,489
It's Christmas day, 4 a.m.

275
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,993
There's a rumble
in my stomach...

276
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,994
-Homer, please.
-(laughing)

277
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,246
Your old man sure loves
pork chops.

278
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,038
He sure does, Uncle Herb.

279
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,632
Bart, Uncle Herb sounds
so formal.

280
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,499
Do you think you could
call me...

281
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,626
-Uncie Herb?
-Oh, <i>no problemo,</i> Uncie Herb.

282
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,673
Ha! He's adorable.

283
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,377
My nephew's adorable.

284
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,797
Marco.

285
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,795
Polo.

286
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,096
-Marco!
-Polo.

287
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,509
Will you kids shut up?

288
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,307
So, Marge, a little
about yourself.

289
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:50,101
Well, I met Homer
in high school.

290
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,476
We got married and had
three beautiful children.

291
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,984
Wow, we have so much
catching up to do.

292
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,986
Hmm. Actually, I just told you
pretty much everything.

293
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,950
-Watch me dive!
-Watch me dive!

294
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,781
-Watch me dive!
-Okay, we're watching!

295
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,786
I hope we're not
spoiling them.

296
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,908
-Man, you weren't watching!
-You didn't see what I did!

297
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,575
-I did a double whammy--
-You didn't watch me dive!

298
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,473
A millionaire?

299
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,088
Oh, I kept the wrong one.
Look, son,

300
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,216
<i>I'll come as soon</i>
<i>as I can get out of here.</i>

301
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,303
<i>In the meantime,</i>

302
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,677
please don't do
anything stupid.

303
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,266
Uncie Herb, can I spit
over the side?

304
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,567
(laughing)
I love this kid.

305
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,941
Hock your brains out.

306
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,607
(hocking)

307
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,735
(hocking)

308
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,452
-Ho, got him!
-(laughing)

309
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,662
Hello, Cook?
Sorry to bother you so late,

310
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,623
but I got a hankering
for some--

311
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,793
That's right!
Don't forget the applesauce.

312
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,751
Okay, Homer.
Pick out any one you want.

313
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,126
HOMER: Are you sure you want
to give me a car?

314
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,763
HERB: Hey, you know what
these things cost me?

315
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,551
There's maybe 40 bucks'
worth of steel in them.

316
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,095
-(chuckles)
-Oh, okay.

317
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,928
I'd like a big one then.

318
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,853
-We don't have a big one.
-Why not?

319
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,102
Because Americans
don't want big cars.

320
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,144
Well, then give me one
with lots of pep.

321
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,058
Sorry, our cars
don't have pep.

322
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,686
-Why not?
-Uh, because...

323
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,443
Americans want
good mileage, not pep.

324
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,525
Homer, tell the nice man

325
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,860
-what country you come from.
-America.

326
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,776
HERB: Do you hear that,
ya morons?

327
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,195
This is why we're getting
killed in the marketplace!

328
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,204
Instead of listening
to what people want,

329
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,786
you're telling them
what they want.

330
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,081
Homer, I need your help.

331
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,245
-You do?
-Yeah.

332
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:41,764
I want you to help me
design a car--

333
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,129
a car for all
the Homer Simpsons out there,

334
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:49,177
and I want to pay you
$200,000 a year!

335
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,763
And I want to let you!

336
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,903
Homer, meet my team
of engineers.

337
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,898
-They're gonna build your car.
-Hiya, team.

338
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,571
Now boys and girls, this
project is our top priority.

339
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,440
Everything else is on hold.

340
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,027
I don't wanna see anything
until it's finished.

341
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,202
But, sir...

342
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
-(team clamoring)
-Bup-bup-bup-bup!

343
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,155
Direct all your questions
to Mr. Homer Simpson,

344
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,253
the man with the vision.

345
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,249
The man who's going to bust
this company out of its rut.

346
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:20,132
The man who's going to change
American transportation forever.

347
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,460
So, uh, what kind of car
would you like, Mr. Simpson?

348
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,667
I don't know.

349
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,087
Whatever you kids
want to do today,

350
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,216
-you just tell Uncie Herb.
-Oh, dear.

351
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,933
I want to go on a pony ride,
Uncie Herb.

352
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,683
I want to go on a boat ride,
Uncie Herb.

353
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,805
-Pony ride. Pony ride.
-Boat ride. Boat ride.

354
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:35,682
-Pony ride.
-Boat ride.

355
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,598
(bickering trails off)

356
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,856
-Ahoy, mateys!
-Yee-ha!

357
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,979
(whinnies)

358
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,105
Kids are so easy to please.

359
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,242
I really hope we're
not spoiling them.

360
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,239
Nah.

361
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,990
What's that?

362
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,322
-The on-board computer.
-Oh, right.

363
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,237
Ooh! What's that do-hickey?

364
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,616
Mr. Simpson, your brother told
you to help us with this car.

365
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,373
-Now, didn't he?
-Oh, yeah, he did.

366
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,915
Mm-hmm. Well, then, why don't
you get us some coffee?

367
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Oh, okay.

368
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,206
Batting ninth... Uncie Herb!

369
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,467
HOMER:
Whew. Oh, boy.

370
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,929
Hey Homer,
how's your car coming?

371
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,469
Oh, fine.
We're putting in

372
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,972
an on-board
something or other,

373
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,894
and rack-and-peanut
steering, I guess.

374
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,603
-Homer.
-Huh?

375
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,894
You didn't ask for rack-and-pinion
steering, did you?

376
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,148
-Uh, yeah, I think I did.
-How could you ask for it?

377
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,610
You don't even know
what it is.

378
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,900
You just called it
rack-and-peanut steering.

379
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,784
-Uh, may I be excused please?
-No.

380
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,950
Homer, do you know why
I gave you this job?

381
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,659
'Cause you think
I'm a genius?

382
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,119
Nah, I don't think
you're a genius.

383
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,529
'Cause you think
I'm dynamic?

384
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,037
I don't think you're dynamic.

385
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,909
-You think I work well with others?
-No, no, no.

386
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,207
Homer, I gave you this job
because you're an average schmo!

387
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,630
-Oh, great.
-All you need is a little self-confidence.

388
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,380
Oh, Uncie Herb, I don't know
anything about cars--

389
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,762
Listen to me.
Here's what you do.

390
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,930
From now on,
before you say anything,

391
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,219
say to yourself:

392
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,301
"If I was ever sure
of anything,

393
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,557
I'm sure of this."

394
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,268
-Do you understand?
-Sort of.

395
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,728
-Homer?
-What?

396
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,638
Answer me again
with self-confidence.

397
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,937
-Sort of!
-Now go get 'em!

398
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,231
(battle cry)

399
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,984
All right, you eggheads! I want
a place in this car to put my drink!

400
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,737
Sir, the car has
a beverage holder.

401
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,109
Hello? Hello, Einstein?

402
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,486
I said a place to put <i>my</i> drink!

403
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,044
You know those super-slackers
they sell in the Quickie Mart?

404
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,078
The cup is this big.

405
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,712
-Extremely large beverage holder.
-And I'm not done yet.

406
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,669
You know that little ball
you put on the aerial

407
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,250
so you can find your car
in the parking lot?

408
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,714
That should be on every car.

409
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,594
Little ball...

410
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,421
And some things are so snazzy
they never go out of style,

411
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,507
like tail fins and bubble domes,
and shag carpeting.

412
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,394
I've got to call the boss.

413
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,931
Yello? Uh-huh.
Well, you know what?

414
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,056
I'm glad you're nervous,

415
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,643
because that means
we're on the right track.

416
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,068
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

417
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,648
Uh-huh.
All right, all right!

418
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,363
Okay this is what
you're going to do.

419
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,363
You're going to hang up,
call me back

420
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,025
and say the exact opposite

421
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,873
of everything you just said.
Good-bye.

422
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,528
Bart, Lisa, come over here.

423
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,447
-LISA: What is it, Uncie Herb?
-I want you to hear

424
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,285
what the guys down at the plant
think of your old man.

425
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,500
-(phone rings)
-Yello?

426
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,250
<i>Um, Homer Simpson</i>
<i>is a brilliant man</i>

427
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:09,254
<i>with lots of well-thought-out,</i>
<i>practical ideas.</i>

428
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,468
<i>He is ensuring the financial</i>
<i>security of this company</i>

429
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,129
<i>for years to come--</i>
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

430
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,928
<i>And his personal hygiene</i>
<i>is above reproach.</i>

431
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,772
-Whoa. Our Dad's the greatest.
-All right.

432
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,518
-Homer, I'm impressed.
-Way to go, Dad.

433
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,980
-Pretty good, eh?
-Yeah.

434
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,650
I want a horn here,
here and here.

435
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,109
You can never find your horn
when you're mad.

436
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,940
And they should all play
"La Cucaracha."

437
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,186
Can do, Mr. S.

438
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,197
And sometimes the kids
are in the back seat.

439
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,529
They're hollering.
They're making you nuts.

440
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,825
There's gotta be something
you can do about that.

441
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,369
Maybe a built-in video game
would keep them entertained?

442
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,043
You're fired! What is
my brother paying you for?

443
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,543
What about a separate soundproof
bubble dome for the kids,

444
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,796
with optional restraints
and muzzles?

445
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,168
Bull's-eye! And another thing.
When I gun the motor,

446
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,466
I want people to think
the world is coming to an end.

447
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,141
Vroom-vroom-vroom!

448
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,564
LISA: The mouse
is named Itchy,

449
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,428
and the cat
is named Scratchy.

450
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,595
-Uh-huh.
-They hate each other.

451
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,064
And they're not shy
about expressing it.

452
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,194
Oh, good, good, good, good.

-Gee, Herb,

498
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,986
because of me,
you lost your business,

499
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,321
your home,
and all your possessions.

500
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:27,037
I can't help but think that maybe
you would have been better off

501
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,699
if I'd never come
into your life.

Well, maybe he just said that
to make conversation.
