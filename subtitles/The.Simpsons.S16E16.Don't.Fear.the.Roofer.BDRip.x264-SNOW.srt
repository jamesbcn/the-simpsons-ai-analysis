from my point of view.

347
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,606
I'm afraid this
calls for electroshock.

348
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,569
(GASPS) Electroshock?

349
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,684
Actually, the technical term
is electroconvulsive therapy.

350
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,764
Well, that's a world
of difference.
Light me up, Doc!

00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,922
When you're getting juiced,
can you hold my turtle?

352
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,411
I want to bring
him back to life.

353
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,409
Aw... What did he die of?

354
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,130
I don't know.
He was dead
when I found him.

00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,127
Sorry. Give me one that
doesn't taste so good.

00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,043
That was rubber
covered in Vaseline!

Marge, write that down
so we can have it at home.

360
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,089
We can't begin
his treatment
soon enough.

I did enjoy lying down.

Well, I'm not worried.

when I validated

408

you eating and drinking

And, Ned,
you didn't see me

411
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,370
because I was hiding
behind the chimney.

412
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,642
(CHUCKLES)
Gee, I thought
my vision was perfect,

413
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,927
and here I was
worshipping false eyeballs.

Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

415
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,562
How come at
Builder's Barn, I saw Homer
talking to thin air.

416
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,483

fixing our roof and
then just disappear?

00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,083
I went through a lot
of pain and suffering

I could make it
up to you.
