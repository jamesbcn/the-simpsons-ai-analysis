1
00:00:06,446 --> 00:00:07,248
What should we do now?
We've captured the cad.

2
00:00:07,448 --> 00:00:08,694
What should we do now?
We've captured the cad

3
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:12,300
who poisoned all those copper
barons, and it's barely 8:00.

4
00:00:12,324 --> 00:00:16,299
Lucky thing I made
an 8:15 reservation right here.

5
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:19,272
Why, this is the restaurant
where you proposed.

6
00:00:19,338 --> 00:00:22,177
Oh, you did remember
our anniversary.

7
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:24,448
Well, look who else remembered.

8
00:00:24,516 --> 00:00:25,417
Aster.

9
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,989
And he's carrying
the Sapphire of Ceylon.

10
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:30,962
Oh, Mick,
you think of everything.

11
00:00:32,197 --> 00:00:34,703
- Aster!
- Oh, let him go.

12
00:00:34,736 --> 00:00:37,842
He can wear it with the diamond
brooch he buried last week.

13
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:39,846
- Well, I'll drink to that.
- Darling,

14
00:00:39,913 --> 00:00:41,784
you drink to everything.

15
00:00:45,057 --> 00:00:46,760
Oh, when I get married,

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,702
I hope I have the breezy
elegance of Mick and Moira.

17
00:00:50,768 --> 00:00:54,442
Oh, I'm sure you'll have
what your father and I have.

18
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:58,985
Yep, ten years,
but we still got that magic.

19
00:01:02,157 --> 00:01:03,828
Thanks, sweetie.

20
00:01:03,894 --> 00:01:06,700
Mmm. Ooh, change the channel.

21
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,336
Love It or Lift It is on.

22
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:11,777
They're going to unwrap
Steven's new face tonight.

23
00:01:11,844 --> 00:01:14,348
Ew, it's covered in Dad cheese.

24
00:01:14,482 --> 00:01:17,756
I'm going to bed.
I'll leave you to your magic.

25
00:01:25,137 --> 00:01:27,742
Bart, I'm worried
about Mom and Dad.

26
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:31,215
The mushroom spores
are replicating.

27
00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:32,852
Torch the fungus.

28
00:01:34,623 --> 00:01:37,361
Lis, I'm holding the ammo
for the whole team.

29
00:01:37,394 --> 00:01:40,133
Bart, I need a reload.

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,471
Ow! Why do I feel that?

31
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:45,143
Mom and Dad have
completely given up.

32
00:01:45,177 --> 00:01:49,352
Their relationship
has no spark or romance.

33
00:01:49,418 --> 00:01:52,157
You got me out of my game
for girl words?

34
00:01:52,257 --> 00:01:54,261
They're nothing like
the couples in movies

35
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:56,533
or prescription drug commercials.

36
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,706
They don't dance on beaches
or hang glide,

37
00:01:59,773 --> 00:02:02,879
They just watch TV
and DustBust burp dust.

38
00:02:03,246 --> 00:02:05,585
I don't know, this sounds
like another Lisa thing

39
00:02:05,618 --> 00:02:08,791
- that's not actually a thing.
- Come with me.

40
00:02:08,858 --> 00:02:11,496
What are our lovely parents
up to this fine Sunday?

41
00:02:11,563 --> 00:02:14,703
Champagne brunch?
Historic walking tour?

42
00:02:14,803 --> 00:02:19,345
Or is Mom crawling around
on homemade kneepads?

43
00:02:19,412 --> 00:02:22,952
Good news. The only ants
I'm finding are already dead.

44
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:24,255
Leave the corpses.

45
00:02:24,322 --> 00:02:27,161
It'll send a message
to the colony.

46
00:02:27,194 --> 00:02:29,065
You might be wondering,
"Why does Dad

47
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:31,870
have a trash can
bungeed to his waist?"

48
00:02:31,937 --> 00:02:34,543
Answer: To catch
his taco droppings.

49
00:02:36,145 --> 00:02:37,949
Homer, if there's room
in your taco trough,

50
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:39,953
I've got a present from Maggie.

51
00:02:39,986 --> 00:02:40,955
Hip hop.

52
00:02:40,988 --> 00:02:42,291
Up top.

53
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,936
Nice throw.

54
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:50,207
Nice catch.

55
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,516
Okay, it's disturbing,
but that's why,

56
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,620
when it comes to parents,
my policy is:

57
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,358
- "Don't look, don't care."
- You should care.

58
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:02,431
You're gonna live with these two
well into your adult years.

59
00:03:02,498 --> 00:03:04,836
Do you want your future dates
to be greeted

60
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,341
by Captain and Mrs. Underpants?

61
00:03:09,078 --> 00:03:10,915
Hey, baby, you look great.

62
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,886
- We got to go.
- Bart,

63
00:03:12,986 --> 00:03:15,157
introduce us.

64
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:17,962
We want to see her.

65
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,708
I hope you have
what we have someday.

66
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:28,049
Couch love. Couch love.

67
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:30,722
We got to do an intervention.

68
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:36,299
Mom, Dad, we need to talk.

69
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:38,704
Not during 21 Days in a Swamp.

70
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:41,142
They're about to reveal who
they found inside the alligator.

71
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:43,012
Cody, Cody, Cody, Cody.

72
00:03:43,113 --> 00:03:45,618
First of all,
this is a safe space.

73
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:46,954
We love you.

74
00:03:47,054 --> 00:03:51,195
But no child should have to see
their parent wear a waste basket.

75
00:03:51,295 --> 00:03:55,003
- It's...
- All you loads do is sit on the couch and watch crappy TV.

76
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,679
We watch educational shows
that teach real-world skills,

77
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,750
like hauling crab
out of the Bering Sea.

78
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:04,155
Do you kids know
how to pull a gaff hook

79
00:04:04,255 --> 00:04:06,159
out of a crabber's forearm?

80
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:08,263
They know nothing
of the sort, Marge.

81
00:04:08,396 --> 00:04:11,469
You've gotten into a rut.
Look at this room.

82
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,576
Two people, and yet there's,
like, six throw blankets.

83
00:04:14,676 --> 00:04:18,349
There's nine.
Each one serves a vital purpose.

84
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,020
And I think it's sweet

85
00:04:20,153 --> 00:04:22,424
that we're so at ease
with one another.

86
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,696
There's so much
you're missing out on.

87
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:28,771
Entertaining, travel,
standing upright.

88
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:30,575
You won the school raffle

89
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,979
for a week at
The Saffron Togetherness Center.

90
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:37,922
But this voucher has sat
on the fridge for a year.

91
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:42,030
Ugh, that thing. We were hoping
to win the kettle corn kettle.

92
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:43,734
But this place sounds perfect.

93
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:46,840
A tranquil setting
that blissifies coupleosity

94
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,315
by removing the distractions
of technology and entertainment.

95
00:04:51,382 --> 00:04:54,355
The Saffron Center
sounds so romantic.

96
00:04:54,455 --> 00:04:56,660
It's at the top
of Honeymoon Mountain.

97
00:04:56,727 --> 00:04:58,931
Unless you saggy-bottomed
couch monsters

98
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,068
have given up on romance.

99
00:05:01,202 --> 00:05:02,639
What? I love romance.

100
00:05:02,705 --> 00:05:06,045
Romance is like my oxygen.
But your mom doesn't want to go.

101
00:05:06,112 --> 00:05:08,216
Oh. Do you want to go?

102
00:05:08,316 --> 00:05:10,253
Of course I do.

103
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,357
Unless you're not into romance,
no judgment.

104
00:05:12,457 --> 00:05:14,328
I love romance.

105
00:05:14,428 --> 00:05:17,836
- So, we're going.
- Great.

106
00:05:17,936 --> 00:05:19,471
- Great.
- Great.

107
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:21,743
- It is great.
- Yep.

108
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:23,881
So great.

109
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:28,089
Hmm, no phones or television
for the whole week,

110
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:30,561
and the menu is keto-based.

111
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:33,734
Are you trying to pronounce
"Cheeto-based"?

112
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,505
No.

113
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:37,575
Deep down, I knew
you probably weren't.

114
00:05:37,609 --> 00:05:40,347
There's a group meditation
on Saturday with Sharice.

115
00:05:40,413 --> 00:05:42,484
- What time's it start?
- Sunrise.

116
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:44,556
We won't be seeing Sharice.

117
00:05:44,623 --> 00:05:46,492
There's silent sweat lodge yoga.

118
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:48,396
Oh, that's also at sunrise.

119
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:51,503
Hmm, "sunrise,"
"sunrise," "sunrise."

120
00:05:51,603 --> 00:05:54,174
Ooh, there's a sunset hike.

121
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:57,147
Nope, that starts at sunrise.

122
00:06:00,521 --> 00:06:03,827
- This place sucks.
- Sucks so hard.

123
00:06:03,894 --> 00:06:06,232
I only wanted to go
because you did.

124
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,504
I never want to go anywhere!

125
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:10,240
Then turn around, baby.

126
00:06:10,307 --> 00:06:13,479
- We're going home.
- Already turning.

127
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:15,283
Homer!

128
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,789
- Turn into the skid.
- I am!

129
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:20,761
Th-Then turn out of the skid.

130
00:06:20,828 --> 00:06:24,034
What does the skid want?

131
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:35,558
Uh, are you okay?

132
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:38,229
Yes. Yes, I-I think so.

133
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:51,523
Rocks!

134
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,727
We have to jump now!

135
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,479
Homer!

136
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,136
Okay, I can pound that dent out.

137
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,476
I'll call AAA.

138
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:21,148
This seems like a good time
to join.

139
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:22,685
Okay, no phone, no car.

140
00:07:22,785 --> 00:07:25,423
But we made it out of the water
and we're safe.

141
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:27,060
Homer, listen to me.

142
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:30,501
We are not safe.
We are in a dire situation.

143
00:07:30,568 --> 00:07:33,072
We're soaking wet
and it's very cold.

144
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:34,943
We have to fix that now.

145
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,613
We have to make a fire.

146
00:07:36,713 --> 00:07:39,451
On our survival shows,
they all use a bow drill.

147
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,659
- Find a sapling.
- Or we could do this.

148
00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:46,198
That's amazing!

149
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:48,136
Where did you learn that?

150
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:50,182
Remember all those recall
letters that said our phone

151
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:53,547
- would swell up and explode?
- But you exchanged that phone.

152
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:56,485
Nope. I said I did.

153
00:07:56,553 --> 00:07:58,724
Okay, fine, fine.
But we have a fire.

154
00:07:58,824 --> 00:08:01,095
Now get those wet clothes off.

155
00:08:01,195 --> 00:08:02,932
In front of the fauna?

156
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:04,301
Just do it!

157
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,707
Almost dry.

158
00:08:06,773 --> 00:08:10,180
Okay, next step: Figure out
the way back to the road.

159
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:12,518
Help me up that tree.

160
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,656
No...

161
00:08:14,756 --> 00:08:16,225
- No, Homer, no.
- I got you.

162
00:08:16,325 --> 00:08:17,538
- Where'd you go?
- Not that way.

163
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:18,931
- Up or down?
- I'm not up!

164
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:20,317
- Can't breathe!
- Turn me around.

165
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,239
And watch my thingy!

166
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,650
Ooch. Ooh. Rough bark.

167
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,788
Homer, don't look up.

168
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:36,533
Dang, my thingy again.

169
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,336
Okay, if you see
more than one road,

170
00:08:38,403 --> 00:08:41,042
we should walk to the one
with a sit-down restaurant,

171
00:08:41,075 --> 00:08:44,214
because I could really go
for a booth.

172
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:47,655
Oh, no.

173
00:08:47,755 --> 00:08:49,626
All I see are trees.

174
00:08:49,692 --> 00:08:52,064
Nothing but trees.

175
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:54,468
So... we're lost?

176
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:57,642
Wait! I see something!

177
00:08:57,742 --> 00:08:59,178
Something bright red!

178
00:08:59,244 --> 00:09:00,447
And it's close by!

179
00:09:03,086 --> 00:09:05,591
- What'd you see? What is it?
- I don't know.

180
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:06,693
But it looks man-made.

181
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,564
And right now,
it's our only hope.

182
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,366
Are the clothes dry?

183
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:12,270
Almost dry.

184
00:09:14,308 --> 00:09:15,544
No, no, no!

185
00:09:15,644 --> 00:09:17,849
This is worse than
Nude and Screwed season six

186
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:19,819
when Jerry got airlifted out

187
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:22,558
because howler monkeys bit
his pixilated area!

188
00:09:22,658 --> 00:09:24,562
Homie, I know this looks bad.

189
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:27,267
We don't have clothes or fire

190
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,906
or shelter or food
or hope of rescue

191
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:32,377
- or...
- I know what we don't have!

192
00:09:32,512 --> 00:09:34,114
But we have the red thing!

193
00:09:34,181 --> 00:09:36,018
And it's all we have!

194
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:37,254
Now, run!

195
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:39,726
Maybe it's a fire truck.

196
00:09:39,793 --> 00:09:41,429
Ow! Or a double-decker bus.

197
00:09:41,495 --> 00:09:43,366
Owie! Or a Twizzler factory.

198
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:45,671
Ow! Ooh, that went in me.

199
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,644
A bathtub?

200
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,215
A sexy bathtub?

201
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:58,196
"Since 1943,

202
00:09:58,229 --> 00:10:02,772
"Honeymoon Mountain has been
a mecca of matrimonial merriment

203
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,049
where newlyweds do that voodoo
you do after saying 'I do.'"

204
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:12,758
A cigarette machine!

205
00:10:17,735 --> 00:10:19,806
Yes! A matchbook!

206
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,745
We have something
to jot phone numbers on!

207
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,989
- Oh... ah...
- Oh... ah...

208
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:30,928
Oh, I can feel
my front stuff again.

209
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:34,234
We can turn these abandoned
snuggle shacks into shelter.

210
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,738
And warm clothes.

211
00:10:35,838 --> 00:10:37,642
What the heck is that?

212
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,714
I think it's
a champagne glass Jacuzzi.

213
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,718
We might just be saved.

214
00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:46,025
Bless you,
old-time honeymoon horndogs.

215
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:11,877
It might be
the melting fiberglass talking,

216
00:11:11,943 --> 00:11:15,851
but I think we'll be okay
until they come and rescue us.

217
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:17,855
Oh, my God.
No one will know

218
00:11:17,955 --> 00:11:20,193
we never made it
to the Saffron Center

219
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,366
because of their
stupid no-phone policy.

220
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,773
I hope their
rooftop tantric pavilion

221
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,646
falls into their
Zen meditation garden.

222
00:11:29,746 --> 00:11:31,081
No one's looking for us.

223
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:33,085
They don't even know
we're missing.

224
00:11:33,185 --> 00:11:34,989
Well,
on Helicopter Hiker Hunters,

225
00:11:35,056 --> 00:11:38,630
they always say:
"If you're lost, stay put,

226
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,233
at least until the snow melts."

227
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,705
That could be tomorrow
or a month from now.

228
00:11:42,805 --> 00:11:44,876
Oh, we've
just got to survive here

229
00:11:44,943 --> 00:11:46,947
until they notice we're gone.

230
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:50,019
Luckily, we have
a warm shelter, water...

231
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:51,556
And love.

232
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:52,959
That's sweet.

233
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:55,965
No, that's the name
of this old massage oil.

234
00:11:58,637 --> 00:12:00,173
Tomorrow we'll find food.

235
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,747
I'll throw another TV
on the fire.

236
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:17,708
Oh, no berries, no nuts,
our traps are all empty...

237
00:12:17,808 --> 00:12:21,215
Oh, I thought I knew
what hunger was,

238
00:12:21,315 --> 00:12:24,187
but now I know that was
just not being full.

239
00:12:24,288 --> 00:12:28,396
Last week there was Cheerios
powder at the bottom of the bag,

240
00:12:28,462 --> 00:12:30,668
and I just threw it out.

241
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:32,705
That powder sounds so good.

242
00:12:32,772 --> 00:12:34,441
Tell me
about the powder again...

243
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:36,345
slowly.

244
00:12:39,786 --> 00:12:42,525
Don't just complain...
Offer solutions!

245
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:48,069
Oh, great, now they're
talking to each other.

246
00:12:49,338 --> 00:12:50,741
- This has to work.
- Yeah.

247
00:12:50,841 --> 00:12:54,047
Fish are way stupider
than rabbits or nuts.

248
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,203
You stupid fish!

249
00:13:05,303 --> 00:13:09,779
Why don't you bite
my bait-less hook?!

250
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:11,015
Oh, be careful.

251
00:13:11,115 --> 00:13:13,386
You'll get your shag pants wet.

252
00:13:13,452 --> 00:13:15,223
I didn't used to wear carpeting!

253
00:13:15,323 --> 00:13:17,394
I used to wear pants!

254
00:13:17,494 --> 00:13:20,166
Made out of pants! Oh!

255
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,903
Homer!

256
00:13:22,037 --> 00:13:24,308
Homer! Homer,
get out of those wet clothes

257
00:13:24,374 --> 00:13:25,978
and get to the fire.

258
00:13:26,045 --> 00:13:27,615
Grab it! Grab it!

259
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:28,917
Don't let it get away!

260
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,556
Oh! I've got fishnet stockings.

261
00:13:31,623 --> 00:13:33,927
Oh, no! They're crotchless!

262
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:35,631
Get him! Get him!

263
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:37,367
Get him! Oh! Oh, no!

264
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:38,467
Don't let it go!

265
00:13:41,308 --> 00:13:43,513
We got it!

266
00:13:43,647 --> 00:13:45,951
Oh, thank you!

267
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:50,259
Thank you, you beautiful fish,
thank you.

268
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,965
Group hug!

269
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:12,538
Oh, oh, this is the best meal
of my life.

270
00:14:14,274 --> 00:14:19,284
Oh, God. This is what I want
to eat for every birthday now.

271
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:24,394
We're gonna be okay.

272
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:27,568
It's amazing how
the world seems brighter

273
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:29,605
with a little food
in your belly.

274
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:31,676
Yeah, you got that right.

275
00:14:31,743 --> 00:14:33,780
- I miss the kids!
- Oh.

276
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:36,285
What if we never see them again?

277
00:14:36,385 --> 00:14:38,657
Oh, honey, honey, honey,
honey, honey.

278
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,193
We're gonna get back home,

279
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:42,698
and you're gonna smother them
with so much love,

280
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:46,438
they'll never become
functioning adults.

281
00:14:46,506 --> 00:14:47,842
You promise?

282
00:14:47,942 --> 00:14:49,512
I promise.

283
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:51,816
Come on, dance with me.

284
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,439
What was that?

285
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,976
Probably just the wind.

286
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:10,854
Don't worry, don't worry.

287
00:15:10,921 --> 00:15:13,125
The clamshell will hold.

288
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:15,964
I think there's a hungry
predator out there.

289
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:18,102
Oh. Good thing we're in here.

290
00:15:18,202 --> 00:15:20,173
It's coming in.

291
00:15:22,645 --> 00:15:25,249
- It's gone.
- What was that?

292
00:15:26,653 --> 00:15:27,655
Wolverine!

293
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,706
Where is it?

294
00:15:47,828 --> 00:15:50,567
Oh, my God, a wolverine!

295
00:15:50,634 --> 00:15:51,914
Just like the one that killed...

296
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,341
- The Wolverine Whisperer.
- We need a weapon.

297
00:15:54,474 --> 00:15:56,278
Wh-What are you doing?

298
00:15:56,345 --> 00:15:57,882
I'm gonna lead it away.
You stay here.

299
00:15:57,982 --> 00:15:59,417
Homer, no!

300
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:09,471
Hey, you!
Come and get the fat man!

301
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,953
Oh, Homie.

302
00:16:17,955 --> 00:16:20,426
Ha! You've been outsmarted
by man:

303
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:22,030
King of Nature!

304
00:16:22,096 --> 00:16:23,967
Destroyer of our planet!

305
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,971
Inventor of Earth Day!

306
00:16:26,038 --> 00:16:28,008
Wait, what are you doing?

307
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:29,979
Hey, no fair. Cut that out.

308
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,001
Hey, you don't want to eat me.
I'm stringy.

309
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,972
Oh, who am I kidding?
I'm marbled.

310
00:16:43,038 --> 00:16:44,909
I'm human Wagyu!

311
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:47,280
Leave him alone!

312
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:49,685
Uh... please?

313
00:16:54,294 --> 00:16:56,298
Marge...!

314
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:08,422
Run! Run!
I can't hold him much longer!

315
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:10,861
Hip hop!

316
00:17:10,928 --> 00:17:12,731
Up top!

317
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:17,006
Run, Marge, run!

318
00:17:17,073 --> 00:17:19,712
Marge, run!
Marge, run! Marge...

319
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:21,281
Homer.

320
00:17:21,348 --> 00:17:22,751
It's...

321
00:17:22,818 --> 00:17:24,254
it's dead.

322
00:17:24,354 --> 00:17:26,559
Marge!
Oh, oh, are you hurt?

323
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:27,928
I'm fine.

324
00:17:27,995 --> 00:17:29,665
No, no. No, you're not.

325
00:17:29,732 --> 00:17:30,834
Where's your shoe?

326
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:41,455
Oh, Marge.

327
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,853
Did I surprise you?

328
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,357
With that sexy wilderness musk,

329
00:17:59,424 --> 00:18:01,796
you're not sneaking up
on anyone.

330
00:18:04,568 --> 00:18:06,706
I'll go forage some more moss
for our love nest.

331
00:18:06,806 --> 00:18:11,014
And later, I'll crotch milady
a fish for dinner.

332
00:18:11,148 --> 00:18:13,987
Oh, sounds perfect.

333
00:18:27,046 --> 00:18:29,317
Hey! Over here!

334
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,823
Come back!

335
00:18:31,923 --> 00:18:33,025
Stop...!

336
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:34,662
Aw, damn it.

337
00:18:34,762 --> 00:18:36,164
What happened? What is it?

338
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:37,801
Oh, I screwed up.

339
00:18:37,901 --> 00:18:39,805
There was a park ranger
right there.

340
00:18:39,905 --> 00:18:41,375
I should've yelled right away,

341
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:43,913
but I looked at you
and our little house, and...

342
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,617
and it... it was too late.

343
00:18:45,684 --> 00:18:46,819
I'm so sorry.

344
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,122
I'm so stupid!

345
00:18:48,222 --> 00:18:49,992
Homie, Homie, Homie, I get it.

346
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:51,829
But we've got
to get out of here.

347
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:53,365
Look... we can follow the tracks.

348
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,637
There has to be
a ranger station nearby.

349
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:58,409
Okay, we'll pack up some water,
wolverine jerky...

350
00:18:58,475 --> 00:19:01,014
- And precious memories.
- Aw.

351
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:02,951
No, that's the name
of this love jelly

352
00:19:03,052 --> 00:19:05,423
I've been using
as bug repellent.

353
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:08,830
Say goodbye to the love shack.

354
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:11,836
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

355
00:19:49,044 --> 00:19:50,246
Bugs!

356
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:54,254
They're in my nose! Ugh!

357
00:19:58,028 --> 00:19:59,732
We did it! There it is!

358
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,705
Homer, wait. Wait.

359
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:04,942
Just one more moment.

360
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:18,302
From now on, I'm gonna try
to be more romantic,

361
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:20,406
like the kids said.

362
00:20:20,473 --> 00:20:22,978
Don't change anything, Homer.

363
00:20:23,045 --> 00:20:25,483
Don't change anything.

364
00:20:26,384 --> 00:20:29,190
I guess we could walk slowly.

365
00:20:29,257 --> 00:20:31,662
We always do.

We go further, so you can.

Sure you don't want to go inside
where it's warm?

371
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:54,942
No. It's time
for my favorite show.
