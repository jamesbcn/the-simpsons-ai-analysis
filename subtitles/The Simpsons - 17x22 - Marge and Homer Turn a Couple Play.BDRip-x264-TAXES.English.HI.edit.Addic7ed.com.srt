00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,123
that we should be
counseling others.

175
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,164
Hey, we've gone
through more hardships

176
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,362
than the Jews and Charlie
Brown put together.

177
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,570
Hmm. Well, we have
managed to squeeze

178
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,405
a lot of fun out
of married life.

179
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,240
Ha-ha. That's just how I feel.

180
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,401
Whoo-hoo!

181
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,521
See, that's what I want, carefree
intimacy with no edge of resentment.

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,809
Buck Mitchell!

183
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,484
Buck, I guess
we can help you out.

184
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,046
We'll start tomorrow.

185
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,884
Hey, Buck, Buck, Buck.
It's me.

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,764
The weird guy
from the stadium.

187
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,764
Uh, there were a lot of weird guys
at the stadium tonight.

188
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,842
You know, I remembered you.

189
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,802
Buck, Tabitha, welcome.

190
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,689
We'll start your first
marriage counseling session

191
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,529
as soon
as Homer gets here.

192
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,006
Sorry I'm late. I was just
gathering my counseling equipment.

193
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,601
(STRAINING)

194
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,281
(WATER RUNNING)

195
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,161
Meh.

196
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,841
Uh...

197
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,600
Now, let's remember
no one's right

198
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,530
and no one's
wrong till I say so.

199
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,969
Ha! I think what Homer
means is

200
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,328
why don't you tell us what each
of you feels is the problem?

201
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,404
Well, I'm an old-fashioned guy, you know.
And when we got hitched,

202
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,530
I just assumed she'd give up her
international recording career

203
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,807
to focus on my minor league
baseball dreams.

204
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,770
Wow, I think we've really
hit on something here.

205
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,923
Unfortunately,
we're out of time.

206
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,565
How does that
make you feel?

207
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,608
Shut up. My
10:00's here.

208
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,921
Ha, ha, ha.

209
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,491
Oh, Homer, please.

210
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,200
Uh... Let's see here.

211
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,281
Uh!

212
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,569
Here's something the book's
previous owner underlined.

213
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,849
"Be honest with your partner
about what you're feeling."

214
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,571
I don't want to waste any more
time in a mismatched marriage.

215
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,041
Hmm.

216
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,250
"Try to frame criticisms of
your spouse in a positive way."

217
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,528
Well, I'm positively
sick of her

218
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,524
shaking her lady parts for
the whole world to eyeball.

219
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,160
Interesting. Interesting.

220
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,880
(PEN SQUEAKING)

221
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,090
Buck, you've got a beautiful
woman with a hot body

222
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,521
that any man
would fantasize about,

223
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,921
even while making
love to his own Marge.

224
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,168
Aw. Thank you, Homer.

225
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,444
Maybe we should stop here.

226
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,567
Good idea, honey.

227
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,325
Buck, would you mind signing a
couple of baseballs for my boy?

228
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,164
Uh. Yeah. Sure.

229
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,851
Just sign your name
above President Lincoln's.

230
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,409
Isn't it weird that our parents
are giving marital advice?

231
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,481
They're always fighting.

232
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,411
If you listen closely, you can
hear them arguing right now.

233
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,485
HOMER: And I say a monkey
can mow our lawn!

234
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,371
This house is spectacular!

235
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,011
You must've had
a great view of the riots.

236
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,605
I stole a rack of fur coats.

237
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,842
I sell one a year
to pay for Christmas.

238
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,050
You make me laugh, Homer.

239
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,565
Why? Because I'm fat?

240
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,165
Okay.

241
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,040
Tonight, we're gonna discuss little
ways to keep your romance alive,

242
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,884
make time
for each other,

243
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,726
an hour, an evening,
a mini-vacation.

244
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,162
Well, I am presenting
at the ESPY Awards next week.

245
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,290
And I'm receiving. Hey, we can
wait for our limos together.

246
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,290
Or, take the same limo!

247
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,566
BOTH: Ohhh!

248
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,171
(BOTH GROANING)

249
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,087
BUCK: Mmm. Oh, yeah.

250
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,846
Like I always say,
compromise is the key.

251
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,565
I always say that.

252
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,166
Let's compromise and
say nobody said it.

253
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,241
Uh!

254
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,968
ANNOUNCER: <i>And here's
the pitch to Buck Mitchell.</i>

255
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,600
<i>It's going, going...</i>

256
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,242
<i>And like America 's credibility
on the world stage,</i>

257
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,891
<i>that ball is gone!</i>

258
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,487
Booyah!

259
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,929
<i>Buck Mitchell is back
and sluggier than ever!</i>

260
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,161
<i>With five
homeruns in two nights,</i>

261
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,163
<i>he's ended rumors
of early retirement</i>

262
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,163
<i>and inspired
rumors of steroid abuse!</i>

263
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,884
<i>But I've heard this turnaround</i>

264
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,169
<i>is due to the marriage counseling
of Marge and Homer Simpson,</i>

265
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,605
<i>seen in this file photo.</i>

266
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,806
Homer, I'm proud of you.

267
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,484
You've prolonged
this celebrity marriage

268
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,170
at least through
playoff season.

269
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,130
After that, who gives a hobo's crap?
Am I right?

270
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,562
<i>I'm a girl who loves a man</i>

271
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,881
<i>And we live in
sexy, marriage land</i>

272
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,842
<i>Sexy, marriage land</i>

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,331
<i>Oh, marriage</i>

<i>Sexy marriage land</i>

275
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,844
Wow. I've got this sudden
urge to give her $5 bill.

276
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,604
That's it. We're
out of here.

277
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,681
Huh?

278
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,127
(CROWD CHEERING)

279
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,049
Hey, Tabitha, great show!

280
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,009
I liked that part where you
mentioned Springfield.

281
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,565
Did you know
that's where you are?

282
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,969
Hey, why don't you
stay and have a bite?

283
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,408
Ohhh, You're so hot.

284
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,206
If only I'd seen you
before I met my wife.

285
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,045
Oh, Homer, you're
sweet, but...

286
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,569
Oh, you're talking
to the chicken.

287
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,047
Don't tell
the hamburger in my car.

288
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,528
Listen, these shows
always tense me up.

289
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,809
While your fingers are greasy,
could you give me a neck rub?

290
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,531
Well, okay.

291
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,726
So, why didn't you marry one
of your crummy backup dancers?

292
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,004
Nah. They're day laborers. We pick
them up in the Home Depot parking lot.

293
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,129
Oh, yeah.

294
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,010
Ohhh! That's it, right there.

295
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,121
Ohhh!

296
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,567
Ohhh, yes! Yes. Yes.
It feels so good!

297
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,210
Ohhh, yeah.

298
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,281
Oh, yeah, baby.

HOMER: (MOANING)

HOMER: Whoa! Thank God
I brought protection.

301
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,320
I used to be so
embarrassed buying these.

302
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,087
Homer Simpson? You're supposed
to be my marriage counselor!

303
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,924
I did workbook pages for you.

304
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,841
D'oh!

305
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,883
Oh, we're gonna have a lot to
talk about at your three o'clock.

306
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,525
There ain't gonna be
a three o'clock.

307
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,524
Cancellations
require 24 hours' notice.

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,601
Hmm.

309
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,840
And that's why Lou Gehrig was a
selfish crybaby who deserved to die.

310
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,084
Springfield,
let's hear from you.

311
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,560
MOE: <i>Uh, yeah.
I got a question.</i>

312
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,361
How come Buck Mitchell's game
is in the toilet, again?

313
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,922
Well, rumor has it
his marriage is failing

314
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,368
due to the inept counseling
of Homer and Marge Simpson.

315
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,049
Ugh. I knew it. I knew it! So,
do l win a Jock Squawk T-shirt?

316
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,201
Uh, no. Sorry.

317
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,727
It don't need
no writing on it.

318
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,881
It don't even
have to be clean.

319
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,121
Is this Moe?

320
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,043
What happened to that
bumper sticker we gave you?

321
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,730
Uh, it's holding in my hernia.

323
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,803
Dad, because you and Mom screwed
up Buck Mitchell's marriage,

324
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,883
some kids beat me
up at school today.

325
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,689
Yeah, they beat me up at work.

326
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,525
Look at the words
they wrote on my skull.

327
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,370
(GASPS) Oh, Papa.

328
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,290
I didn't want you to learn
that word this way.

329
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,200
Marge, we gotta get Buck
and Tabitha back together.

330
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,408
This is the most important
case of our careers.

331
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,446
Listen, bub. We are out of the
marriage counseling business.

332
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,170
And the only one
you should be giving

333
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,322
chicken grease
neck rubs to is me!

334
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,767
But not me, because I
think they're disgusting!

335
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,130
Oh! So, now we're judging each
other based on things we've done!

336
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,248
Real fair! Class act!

337
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,889
I'm going back to the stadium to
bring those two kids back together.

338
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,844
And I'll do it
with or without you.

339
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,241
Then I guess
you'll do it without me.

00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,410
Oh, but I wanted to
do it with you!

I was just thinking
sad thoughts about you.

351

I'm leaving Buck.

Well, yeah.

He was the first man who didn’t
just like me for my body.

me on my hair.
