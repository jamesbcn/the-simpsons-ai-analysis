Thank God I aced chest compressions

353
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,073
at Mayo pre-med camp!

354
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,479
And Bart's okay!

355
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,067

356

364
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,338

Hey, Bart, you are coming
to my graduation party tonight?

368
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,102
I don't know, man. It's humiliating.

369
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:23,017
My little sister's graduating
the same year as me.

370
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,067
Haw haw!

371
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,070
Nelson, how can you say that
with what's happened to you?

372
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,453
Yeah, well,
I bought a totally bitching car

373
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,202
with the money I got
selling my pituitary gland.

374
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,998
So cool.

376

when Kearney Jr. graduated.

Ralph, you joined the army?

382
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,651
Yes, because I needed a costume
for this party.

383
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,360
At college I'm gonna reinvent myself.

384
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,111
I'll pretend I have a girlfriend
in Canada.

385
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:12,453
I'll say she lives in Alberta
and her name is Alberta,

386
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,581
so I don't have to remember two lies.

387
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,697
Bart! I was getting worried.

388
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,077
I'm your oldest buddy.

389
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,714
I was there when you got your nose done,

390
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,290
then I was there when you
had your nose undone.

391

Yes, it's the only thing
your father does well.

397
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:42,444
Can't you two put it aside
for one night in honor of me?

398
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,809
-No!
-No!

399
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,016

with all the rocks they threw at me.
