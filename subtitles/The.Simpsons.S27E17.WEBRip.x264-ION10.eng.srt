was because of him,

Okay, guys,

142
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,180
I'm gonna find him a boyfriend on this.

143

00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,478
My wife put me on to it.

147
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,861
I was looking for an app
for pepper grinders,

148
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,108
and I found this.

149
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,229
Uh, doesn't Smithers dig Burns?

150
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,436
Yeah, but Burns doesn't want Smithers.

151
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,697
Isn't it sad, Marge,
when somebody really,

152
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,030
really, really, really wants somebody,

153
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,197
and they're sitting across the bar

154
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,747
Moe, this is why I don't come here much.

155
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:40,291

Hmm, no.

No. Too smoldering.

00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,423
Finally, I'm paid to act.

176
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,182
Tell you what, if you buy
a half-page ad in the program,

177
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:36,432
Sam plays "As Time Goes By"
with Hulk hands.

178
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,176
-(register dings)
-You have a deal.

179
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,310
I'm glad someone's getting
something from this play.

180
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,147
(sighs) As an understudy,

181
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,693
all I get is to watch
Lisa and Jack fall in love.

182
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,198
Oh, you're still here.

183
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,655
Look, Milhouse, if anything happens

184
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,873
to that kid playing Rick...

185
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,334
you get the part.

186
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,003
If you catch my drift.

187
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,672
You know I can't catch.

188
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,540
(slurping)

189
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,337
Don't judge me.

190
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,974
Jack, you're amazing.

191
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,549
You're blowing away
everyone else in the play.

192
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,720
(in Peter Lorre voice)
You despise me, don't you?

193
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,637
If I gave you any thought,

194
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,885
I probably would.

195
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,648
(in normal voice)
I'll be in my trailer.

196
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,571
This isn't Fiji water.

197
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,489
Yo, dingus,
someone doesn't want you in that play.

198
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,070
Who let you three gorillas
out of the zoo?

199
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,235
(laughs) Gorillas.

200
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,414
It's not funny.

201
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,583
(grunting, shouting)

202
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,161
How'd you get the bullies
to take out Jack?

203
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,917
The most powerful bribe in the world--

204
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,839
a free full-page ad in the play program.

205
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,090
It's a funny thing about fists,
everyone gets them,

206
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,932
but not everyone
gets the instruction manual.

207
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:57,349
Oh, no, his mouth wrote checks
his fists could cash!

208
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:03,524
(gasps) Someone is using the go-round
for non-merry purposes.

209
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,693
(over P.A.): Attention--
in <i>Casablanca, </i>the part of Rick Blaine

210
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,272
will now be played by Milhouse.

211
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,527
Also, the cafeteria is out of buns,

212
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,240
so for hamburgers we will now be using

213
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,860
two slices of day-old toast.

214
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,356
That is all.

215
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,198
(crunching loudly)

216
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,035
Where you're going, I can't...

217
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,211
Line!

218
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,539
Follow!

219
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,134
Sounds weird to me.

220
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,878
"I can't follow." "I can't follow."

221
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:33,301
Also, why would Nazis respect letters
of transit signed by De Gaulle?

222
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,642
I may be pulling on a thread,
but hear me out...

223
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,968
(groans)

224
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,303
(dance music playing)

225
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,387
(indistinct conversations)

226
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,973
Everything looks great, Marge.

227
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,808
-That cheese is cubed perfectly.
-Thank you.

228
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,654
I get queasy when I see cubes
that are cut on the bias.

229
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,520
(doorbell rings)

230
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,567
Oh, Mr. Smithers.

231
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,071
Come in, come in, come in.

232
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,822
Can I get you a Tom Collins?

233
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,074
Hello, Tom Collins.

234
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,990
Hmm, I see what's going on here.

235
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,746
Fix up your boss
so he won't be so hard on you.

236
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,248
Well, nice try.

237
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,831
I want a vodka tonic,
and then I'm gonna leave.

238
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,958
Mr. Collins, would you be charmed

239
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,665
by horror stories
of working with Bill Shatner?

240
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,426
-Uh, who?
-I like you already.

241
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,509
You know what?

242
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,013
I don't think that attitude
is the real you.

243
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:24,226
I believe you have a pinched nerve
in your neck, and guess what?

244
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:27,688
You're in luck,
because I give great massage.

245
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,480
-Sorry, not interested.
-(bones pop)

246
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,573
Wow, wow.

247
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,819
How did you do that?

248
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,950
Would you like to discuss that
over Peruvian tapas?

249
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,988
Simpson, I'm stealing your bartender.
Take the next couple days off.

250
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,533
Whoo-hoo! Three-day bender!

251
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,706
Are there any gay-themed songs
about celebrating?

252
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,169
<i>♪ Celebrate ♪</i>

253
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,420

<i>♪ Let's celebrate... ♪</i>

255
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,303
Did you used to jog with Monty?

256
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,511
Mm, sort of.

257
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,511

00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,897
(humming)

263
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,863
Smithers, where have you been?

264
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,403
I'm dictating my autobiography.

265
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,986
Chapter One--
A Commotion at the Telegraph Office.

266
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,822
I'm afraid I have other plans.

267
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,277
There are no other plans.

268
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,287
Now take my picture for the back cover.

269
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,002
No, sir, I don't think I will.

270
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,750
In fact, what I'm going to do is...

271
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,593
quit!

272
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,168
(gasps) My God, I did it.

273
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,264
I actually quit.

274
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,338
No one quits me.

275
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,335
(groans)

276
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,259
One more button.

277
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,347
(screams)

278
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,852
You're forgetting
who installed this system.

279
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,148
MR. BURNS: Ahoy-hoy!

280
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,482
(bird caws)

281
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,857
So, you want time off
for your sister's funeral?

282
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,874
(laughs)
Miss Naegle, release the hounds.

283
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,068
Wh-What do you mean?

284
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,658
Send vicious dogs to rip him to shreds.

285
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,834
But wouldn't I be criminally liable?

286
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,003
I said release! Release, release!

287
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,381
That sounds vaguely sexual.

288
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,129
I'm gonna have to file a grievance.

289
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,171
Also, let's just see how you've been
treating those hounds.

290
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,335
What the...

291
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,883
Okay, we're gonna have
to shut this all down.

292
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,927
You know, he doesn't
give me health insurance...

293
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,561
and I, uh, I think I have rabies.

294
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,179
Okay, that's it, Mr. Burns.

295
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,765
I'm gonna need to speak
to your head of Human Resources.

296
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,271
It's this guy.

297
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,743
Um... what are you doing?

298
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,239
Oh, sorry.
I used to do that for Mr. Burns.

299
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,241
Ah, forget about Burns.

300
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,623
Ancient-a history.

301
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,119
I left-a the Italy 40 years ago,

302
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,912

You're right, totally.
I'm here for you.

308
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,979
Listen, I'm making a trip to Cuba, okay?

309
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:20,113
My homeland,
where my accent is not so "reedicoloss."

310
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,192
Come with me to Havana.

Oh, what the hell,

00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,219
He's so bad.

00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,221

00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,388
what I do is treat them

00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,647
(sniffles) Really?

324
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,729
If they sense you believe in them,
they'll get better.

325
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,315
Did our taxes, Marge.

326
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,820
The government owes us $2 million.

327
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,163
That is really, really great,

328
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,988
but maybe you should check again.

329
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,083
What? Oh, I... my mistake.

330
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,659
We owe them $37.

331
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,794
That's some nice adding.

332
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,411
Yeah.

339
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,852

Waylon, I am a man who needs
100% commitment, okay?

345
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,330
Okay, well, maybe not 100,

346
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,830
but at least, like, 20, you know,
which is the percentage

347
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,124

to stay in the green.

348
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,828

I make-a something
very special for your reunion.

One cheese pizza.

401
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,665
Well, Smithers, I got here as soon
as I heard you wanted to meet.

402
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,138
Took something called Uber,
which I thought would be

403
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,219
a Wehrmacht staff car,
but turned out to be a... (groans)

let me say I don't want money,

00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,695
and I don't want some letter
written by your lawyers.

411
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,120

00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,458
Maybe a little, still.

00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,091
All right, Smithers.
There's one thing I've never given you.

I know nothing about them,
