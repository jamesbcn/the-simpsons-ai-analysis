{\an8}Marge, I'm out of beer.

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,390
{\an8}You know, Homie, a lot of men
use their Saturdays

21
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,595
{\an8}to do things around the house.
Hint, hint.

22
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,476
{\an8}But, Marge,
I'm not like other men.

23
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:49,944
{\an8}That's why you buy my pants
at that special store.

24
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:53,316
{\an8}I'm serious. You never finished
painting the garage...

00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:57,365

{\an8}Fine. I'll drop everything
I'm doing just for you.

28
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,294
{\an8}But you'll have to live with the
guilt of ruining my Saturday.

29
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,707
{\an8}Can you live with that, Marge?

{\an8}You're Pop?

00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,065
{\an8}No offense, but even
I could kick your ass.

38
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,479
{\an8}Hey, get off my case.

39
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,027
{\an8}The only reason
I'm working here is

40
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,820
{\an8}'cause I'm trying to get
a date with Mom.

41
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,953
{\an8}Look, Pop, I'm planning
some expert home repairs

42
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,624
{\an8}and I need a pair of
bolt cutters or wire cutters,

43
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,174
{\an8}or something to get
the lock off my toolbox.

00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,328
{\an8}Aisle one,
next to the cat poison.

00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,302

could ratchet up the romance

49
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,059
{\an8}Lately you just say "ha"

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,980

My name is Astrid Weller.

152
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,735
I own an art gallery

153
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,243

your piece.

154
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,195
You mean this hunk of junk?
This isn't art.

155
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,707

Art isn't just pretty pictures.

159
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,924
It's an expression
of raw human emotion.

160
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,797
In your case, rage.

161
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,554
Oh, I got that, lady.

162
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,095
Is everything OK?

163
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,509
I got worried when
I didn't hear any shots.

164
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,388
This lady says I'm an artist.

165
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,345
You? An artist?

166
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:01,555
Your husband's work
is what we call "outsider art."

167
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,607
It could be by a mental patient,

168
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,151
or a hillbilly, or a chimpanzee.

169
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,985
(gasps) In high school,
I was voted

170
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,910
"Most likely to be
a mental patient,

171
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,529
hillbilly, or chimpanzee."

172
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,236
Well, you should be
very excited,

173
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,537
because outsider art
couldn't be hotter.

174
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,422
So you'd better catch the fever.

175
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,329
Catch it.

176
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,433
{\an8}(munching)

177
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,180
{\an8}Dad, chew with
your mouth closed.

178
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,221
{\an8}You're losing your mystique.

179
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,599
Lisa, all great artists
love free food.

180
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,393
Check out Jasper Johns.

181
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,519
You squeal on me, I'll kill you.

182
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,284
Mmm. I don't know.

183
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,899
I studied art for years,
but I just don't get this.

184
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,697
Sounds like somebody's jealous.

185
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,622
No, I'm not.

186
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,410
I just can't believe some people

187
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,164
are paying hundreds of dollars

188
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,916
for something a hillbilly
pulled out of the trash.

189
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,918
Hey, I done studied for years

190
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,170
on how to get over
that junkyard fence.

191
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,592
Then I learnt the gate was open.

192
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,721
Smithers, I think I'm in love...

193
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,392
-(gasps)
-...with this sculpture.

194
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,971
Sir, that's by Homer Simpson.

195
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,807
I don't think
you want to buy it.

196
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,732
Smithers, years ago,
I blew the chance

197
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,692
to buy Picasso's
<i>Guernica </i>for a song.

198
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,443
Luckily, that song
was "White Christmas."

199
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,775
And by hanging on to it,
I made billions.

200
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,820
Anyway, I love
this hideous thing.

201
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,155
Young lady, I'll take it.

202
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,161
{\an8}Congratulations, Homer.

203
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,873
{\an8}You're now
a professional artist.

204
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:43,004
Whoo-hoo!
Look, Marge, my first sale!

205
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,252
In your face Jasper Johns!

206
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,504
Huh?

207
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,300
(grunting)

208
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,005
Where are you going
with that junk, Dad?

209
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,885
I'm going to be
an outsider artist.

210
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,182
That way, I can turn
all these old baseball cards,

211
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,476
Disney memorabilia and antiques
into something valuable.

212
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,731
Homie, I'm really happy
you sold your sculpture,

213
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,984
but don't you think
it may have been a fluke?

214
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,856
Hey, I've always had
an interest in art

215
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,113
dating back
to my schoolgirl days,

216
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:16,405
when I painted portrait
after portrait of Ringo Starr.

217
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,620
That's my life
you're describing.

218
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:22,331
I think I remember
my own life, Marge.

219
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,833
Astrid said the key to my art
is anger, but you know me.

220
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,996
-I'm Mr. Mellow.
-BOTH: Hmm?

221
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:31,045
So, I'm giving you kids
permission to get me mad.

222
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,210
Come on. Gimme what you got.

223
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,968
Well, if it'll help, um...

224
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,931
Mom found out her engagement
ring is made of rock candy.

225
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,886
(grunting) Good work, honey.
Keep it coming.

226
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,484
Well, I'm flunking math,
and the other day

227
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,139
I was a little attracted
to Milhouse.

228
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,937
(yelling)

229
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:50,781
(screaming)

230
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,395
Moe, this is Astrid, my dealer.

231
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,567
And these are my fans,
Gunter, Kyoto

232
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,696
and Cecil
Hampstead-on-Cecil-Cecil.

233
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,623
So, uh, you guys
are Eurotrash, huh?

234
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,542
How's that, uh,
working out for you?

235
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,211
Eh, to be honest, we are adrift

236
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,340
in a sea of decadent luxury
and meaningless sex.

237
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:14,669
Uh-huh. So, where might
this sea be located? Hmm?

238
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,127
I must get back to my hotel

239
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,427
and practice
my affectations for tomorrow.

240
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,891
[in French] <i>Bon soir.</i>

241
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,471
[in English] What do we
owe you, Moe?

242
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:22,595
Nothing, nothing.

243
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,182
Just give me a priceless sketch

244
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,016
with a certificate
of authenticity.

245
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,522
All right. (mumbling)

246
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,074
Hey, Moe, could I pay
with a drawing?

247
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,898
Yeah, nice try, there, 12-step.

248
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,363
Aw!

249
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,541
Uh, Homer, you're making us
a little bit uncomfortable.

250
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:46,248
Relax, big guy. He's just doing
this for his art. Right, Homer?

251
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,630
{\an8}Oh, yeah... art.

252
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,884
Why won't you be art? (grunts)

253
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,133
Here he is.

254
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,184
This is where the magic happens.

255
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,429
Wonderful news, Homer.

256
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,800
Is it about pies?

257
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,806
Uh, um, no.

258
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:07,098
We're going to hold a show
devoted entirely to you.

259
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:12,234
Wow. It's like Marge's dream
come true for me.

260
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,944
Isn't that great, Marge? For me.

261
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,435
(Marge groaning)

262
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,412
Look, Marge. They're advertising
my show in <i>Art in America.</i>

263
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,870
It's the first time I've been
mentioned there that I know of.

264
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,912
I'm happy for you.
Now, good night.

265
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,246
Good night.

266
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,753
You're upset about something.

267
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,633
Is this about that trip
Barney and I took

268
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,040
to Machu Picchu?

269
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,128
Now, Homer,

270
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,962
being an artist was my dream.

271
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,467
But now, without even trying,

272
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,930
you've accomplished
more in a week

273
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,970
than I have in my whole life.

274
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,563
Aw, honey,
I've always liked your art.

275
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,729
Your paintings look like
the things they look like.

276
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,349
That's sweet, but...

277
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,146
How would you like it if I,

278
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,479
I don't know,
entered a belching contest?

279
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,396
Frankly, I'd be
a little turned on.

280
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,025
(sighs) You don't understand.

281
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,322
Marge, I've screwed up
everything I've ever done.

282
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,487
I mean, look at Bart.

283
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,366
But I finally found something

284
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,003
where people worship me
for screwing up,

285
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,920
and that feels pretty good.

286
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,669
{\an8}I guess nothing else matters

287
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,591
{\an8}as long as you're happy.

288
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,589
Now you're making sense.
Good night.

289
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:24,182
{\an8}(Homer snoring)

290
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,768
(indistinct chattering)

291
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,901
-Then I bought a Rembrandt.
-(burps)

292
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,901
Homer is the most dangerous
artist on the Springfield scene.

293
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,364
Now, let's see what surprises
he has for us tonight.

294
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,486
(applause)

295
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,493
I give you "botched hibachi."

296
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,115
The tricycle's on loan from
the Maggie Simpson collection.

297
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,370
This piece I call
"failed shelving unit

298
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,206
with stupid, stuck chainsaw
and applesauce."

299
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,462
And finally,
my thing <i>de resistance,</i>

300
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,666
"attempted birdhouse one."

301
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,217
(cawing)

302
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,391
(appalled murmuring)

303
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,720
Shall we start the bidding at,
say, $10,000?

304
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,272
(indistinct throat-clearing)

305
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,851
{\an8}All right, how about a million?

306
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,897
{\an8}I'll give you two bucks for
the bird if it's still alive.

307
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,244
What's going on here?

308
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,988
You weirdos love this stuff.

309
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,240
Homer, I'm afraid they only
love what's new and shocking.

310
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,913
These pieces are just like
your earlier work.

311
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,663
You've gone from hip to boring.

312
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,455
Why don't you call us
when you get to kitsch?

313
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,880
(strained laugh)

314
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,588
Come on, Gunter, Kyoto.

315
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,498
If we hurry, we can still catch
the heroin craze. Mm.

316
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,258
Wait! Come back!
I'm a God to you!

317
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,550
Worship me

318
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,513
or fear my wrath!

319
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,264
Oh, please, fear my wrath!

320
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,806
Please!

321
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,680
Call me.

322
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,560
{\an8}I don't get it.

323
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,316
Why don't people
like my art anymore?

324
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,029
Homer, I know you worked hard,

325
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:06,109
but all of your <i>things</i>
were kind of the same.

326
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,566
Hey, Ray Jay Johnson
never changed his act.

327
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,867
And he's more popular now
than he's ever been.

328
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:11,871
Who?

329
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,122
<i>♪ You can call him Ray ♪</i>

330
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,043
<i>♪ Or you can call him Jay ♪</i>

331
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,042
<i>♪ Or you can call him Ray-Jay ♪</i>

332
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,544
<i>♪ But you doesn't have to... ♪</i>

333
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,336
I'm sick of him already.

334
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,759
The point is, great artists
are always trying new things.

335
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,629
Like Michelangelo,
or Shaquille O'Neal.

336
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,217
You just need some inspiration.

337
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,056
It's so exciting to do
something cultural together.

338
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,475
Matt Groening?
What's he doing in a museum?

339
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,401
He can barely draw.

340
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,570
Ow! Oh, no! I'm being erased!

341
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,820
Move it, bub. We got
an installation to installate.

342
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,664
Mm, a Claes Oldenburg.

343
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,240
{\an8}He's a European
who defied convention

344
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,696
{\an8}and embraced
American popular culture.

345
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,037
(whistles)

346
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,711
He must be 100 feet tall.

347
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,462
Now this is a Joseph Turner.

348
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,214
In an era when everyone else
painted portraits,

349
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,337
he broke away by painting
the Venetian canals.

350
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:11,845
It's glorious. The streets are
paved with water.

351
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,849
You could ride a walrus to work.

352
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:17,271
And Picasso started out
painting realistically,

353
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,941
then moved on to cubism.

354
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,019
By the end of his life,
he was just painting

355
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,815
crank letters to the editor.

356
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,108
{\an8}they call it his
"angry jerk" period.

357
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,565
(gurgling)

358
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,743
Mm... Split-pea.

359
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,662
(gasping) With ham!

360
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,450
Any ideas yet?

361
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,874
No. These guys are geniuses.

362
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,293
I could never think of something
like soup or a pencil.

363
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,923
Oh!

364
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,670
I'm just going to rest
for a minute.

365
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,165
(snoring)

366
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,473
(growling)

367
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,802
(sniffing)

368
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,007
What the... Who the... Hey!

369
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,427
(karate yell)

370
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:01,515
(yelping) You're mean.

371
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,858
(playing happy Spanish music)

372
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,070
-(guns cocking)
<i>-Hasta la vista, </i>baby!

373
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,242
(machine gun firing)

374
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,199
(moaning)

375
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,081
Hmm? (groans) What the...

376
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,664
Ew!

377
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,504
(gasps) D'oh!

378
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,705
(grunts) Soup's on, fat boy.

379
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,591
Ow! (screams) No!

380
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,759
{\an8}Ow! No! Ow! No. No.

381
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,589
-Andy, no!
-Homer. Homer!

382
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,675
Marge! Oh, why does art hate me?

383
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,762
I never did anything to art.

384
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,267
Oh. Let's get out of here.

385
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,232
Well, Dad, if the museum
didn't inspire you,

386
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,362
maybe you should do something
really radical, like Christo.

387
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,610
Is he that jerk that revealed

388
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,981
the magician's secrets?

389
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,108
No. Christo is
a conceptual artist

390
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,315
who does huge outdoor projects.

391
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,735
He once wrapped
the Reichstag in plastic.

392
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,704
Not the Reichstag!

393
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,445
Oh, yes, and he also set up
hundreds of yellow umbrellas

394
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,367
-along the California highway.
-Why did he do that?

395
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,127
To make the world a more
magical place, I guess,

396
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,670
Although they did blow over
and kill some people.

397
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,214
Killer umbrellas?

398
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,919
Of course.

399
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,627
Exquisite.

400
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,427
No, Dad. No. My point is,
you have to do

401
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,391
something big and daring.

402
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,721
Big? Daring? Lisa, that's it!

403
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,477
I've got an idea
for a wonderful art project

404
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,439
that'll make everyone
love me again.

405
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,770
Step one, steal all
the doormats in town.

406
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,356
Hit the road, "Welcome home."

407
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,025
<i>Adios </i>, "Casa de Flanders."

408
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,159
See ya in hell,
"God bless this house."

409
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,120
So long, "The Simpsons."

410
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,411
D'oh!

411
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,460
HOMER: <i>Step two,</i>
<i>snorkel the animals.</i>

412
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:52,295
{\an8}(panting) It wasn't easy
But I got all the grizzlies.

413
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,051
Great. I'll do the pony
while you do the lions.

414
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,014
Make sure you
strap 'em on real tight.

415
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,101
Now, step three.

416
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,851
Are you sure this is art
and not vandalism?

417
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,354
That's for the courts
to decide, son.

418
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,646
-(water gurgling)
-(birds chirping)

419
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,904
(creaking)

420
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,396
HOMER: <i>Wake up!</i>
<i>Wake up, Springfield!</i>

421
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,407
<i>I've got a surprise for you.</i>

422
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,700
Oh, Lord, what now?

423
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,044
(dolphin clicking)

424
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,749
Oh, that can't be good.

425
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,539
<i>People of Springfield,</i>

426
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,502
<i>behold, my latest work!</i>

427
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,293
Homer, what have you done?

428
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,877
It's conceptual art.

429
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,882
The grand canals of Springfield.

430
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,014
Just like Venice, without the
black plague. What do you think?

431
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,472
I think some people
are going to be upset.

432
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,263
I love it, Homer.

433
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,096
You've turned this town
into a work of art.

434
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,523
I just wish Jasper Johns
hadn't stolen my boat.

435
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,766
-(screams)
-So long, suckers!

436
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,855
Well, they're in the business.

437
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,940
Real people might not be
so understanding.

438
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,777
FLANDERS: What the flood?

439
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,112
Maude, it's a miracle!

440
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,868
The Lord has drowned the wicked

441
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,739
and spared the righteous.

442
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,076
(gasps) Isn't that
Homer Simpson?

443
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:09,422
{\an8}Ugh. Looks like heaven's easier
to get into than Arizona State.

444
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:14,458
Oh! I hate these flood pants.

445
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,507
Hey! They're working!

446
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,643
My feet are soaked,
but my cuffs are bone-dry.

447
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,471
Everything's comin' up,
Milhouse.

I hope the answer is yes.

you created something
people really love.
