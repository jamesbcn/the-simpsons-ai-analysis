1
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:14,971
D'oh!

2
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:39,082
Each year,

3
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:41,519
one graduate receives
the prestigious

4
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:44,740
Golden Baton Award
for the most impressive

5
00:00:44,783 --> 00:00:45,784
future conductor.

6
00:00:45,828 --> 00:00:50,137
But this year,
we have two worthy recipients.

7
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,139
Two?

8
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:53,227
That's right.

9
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,100
Gustavo Dudamel
and local wunderkind,

10
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:59,450
Mr. Dewey Largo.

11
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:05,500
I'm sure you will each achieve
tremendous renown.

12
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:08,024
No, wait.

13
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,895
I believe that one of you will.

14
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:12,811
And the other will fail
and have a horrible life

15
00:01:12,855 --> 00:01:15,031
as a public school
music teacher.

16
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:23,039
Oh, Dudamel.

17
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,737
Dudamel. Yo-Yo Ma!

18
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:28,044
Oh, Dewey, my pouty poppet.

19
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,785
You're having that dream again?

20
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:32,614
Oh, it's so cruel
that my only triumph

21
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:34,746
has become
my recurring nightmare.

22
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,401
Oh, darling, you're cursed
with the memory of an elephant.

23
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:39,360
And the wrinkles to match.

24
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:41,797
Can't you just wake me
with a slice of melon

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,059
and a drop of affection?

26
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,540
Whatever you say, Lord Grumpy
of the Morning Breath.

27
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:55,289
Now, Petal, don't forget
to call the dog walker.

28
00:01:55,332 --> 00:01:56,638
Tell him to come early.

29
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:58,292
And easy on the leash.

30
00:01:58,335 --> 00:01:59,815
Oh, it's on my list.

31
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:02,513
Also, don't forget to call
someone about the water bill.

32
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:04,863
I suspect a sputtering spigot.

33
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:07,388
You know, you are home all day.

34
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:08,606
Hence my annoyance.

35
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,174
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Pinterest awaits.

36
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:15,396
Oh, shut up, Sir Winston,

37
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,572
or there'll be no cigar for you.

38
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:28,104
Dear Mr. Largo,
I am the musical director

39
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,671
of the Capital City
Philharmonic.

40
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:32,369
I've heard you've got talent.
Big talent, major chops,

41
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:33,675
the goods.

42
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:37,679
So I'll be attending
your concert tomorrow night.

43
00:02:37,722 --> 00:02:40,116
Intriguingly yours,
Victor Kleskow.

44
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:46,427
P.S. I will be bringing
an outside beverage.

45
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,342
Large, icy, nonalcoholic.

46
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:51,301
Okay, gang.

47
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:54,348
Our recital's tomorrow,
and we're gonna be ready.

48
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:56,828
And if you play the way
I know you're capable of,

49
00:02:56,872 --> 00:02:59,135
you'll never see me again.

50
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:03,400
You have hidden talent
bubbling inside you,

51
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:05,663
and this baton
will pop it right out.

52
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:09,058
Sherri, more fortissimo.
Terri, more pianissimo.

53
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:11,495
Milhouse, don't forget
to tune your...

54
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:12,844
What the heck are you playing?

55
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:14,846
No one really knows.

56
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,718
Well, then, wear it
on your head.

57
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,243
Here we go.
I'm gonna do something

58
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:23,290
I've never done as a teacher
before, actually try.

59
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,074
One, two, three, four.

60
00:03:58,716 --> 00:04:00,501
Are you sure
we're at the right school?

61
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:03,417
I mean, they sound good.

62
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:06,898
Oh, my gosh, it's bearable.

63
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,953
Sir? Did it move you?

64
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:20,651
Skinner, didn't I ask
for a buffer chair

65
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:23,306
between you and me
at all of these events?

66
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,177
Buffer.

67
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:30,400
Brilliant.
How did you manage it?

68
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:31,880
It was good, wasn't it?

69
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:34,535
Let's just say I separated
the wheat from the chaff.

70
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:37,059
I'm in the F hole.

71
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,498
Oh, Salieri,
patron saint of losers,

72
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,370
runners-up and also-rans,

73
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:45,546
please let this Garfunkel
become a Simon,

74
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:47,112
this Pepsi become a Coke,

75
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:49,593
and this ugly duckling
conduct Swan Lake.

76
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,031
Hi. Victor Kleskow.
We're conductors,

77
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:54,729
so don't shake hands,
just a friendly wave

78
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:56,470
on the beat of four,
three, two and done.

79
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:57,819
I'm honored, maestro.

80
00:04:57,862 --> 00:04:58,907
Let's cut to the chase.

81
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,343
That was good,
middle school good.

82
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:02,606
Tonight, I witnessed
a once-in-a-semester talent

83
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,608
that I must add
to my organization.

84
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:06,175
Dewey...

85
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:09,221
have to keep talking,
or can I meet Lisa Simpson?

86
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:10,962
But-but-but she's a child.

87
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:12,703
Yes, I'm scouting talent
for our youth philharmonic.

88
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:14,749
Surely, you didn't think
I wanted you?

89
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:16,490
No, no, of course not.

90
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:17,969
Lisa's right over there.

91
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:19,623
Red dress,
intelligent expression.

92
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,103
Can't miss her.

93
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:27,588
Mr. Largo, he picked me.

94
00:05:27,631 --> 00:05:29,546
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,940
I'm really glad
you get to represent us.

96
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:35,204
It's like a little piece of meis
taking a baby practice step.

97
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:37,293
That is so generous.

98
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,557
Yes, yes, there is an upside
to having a broken spirit.

99
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:43,778
Mr. Kleskow said my articulation

100
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:45,649
was the best he's ever heard.

101
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:49,566
He said I sounded like a young
Cannonball Adderley.

102
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,569
Ooh, is that the raccoon
on Saturday morning cartoons?

103
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:54,963
I'm talking about
the famous jazz musician.

104
00:05:55,006 --> 00:05:57,400
I don't know
who you're talking about.

105
00:05:57,444 --> 00:06:00,403
The guy I'm thinking of
would make himself into a ball

106
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,275
and knock over all the crows.

107
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:06,540
Homie, this class
is 30 miles each way.

108
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,889
We can do it!

109
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:09,673
I'll practice in the car.

110
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:12,110
60 miles in the car
with Lisa practicing.

111
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:13,982
I've got a symphony for you.

112
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:16,027
<i>Sucks to be you</i>

113
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:17,986
<i>Sucks to be you,
sucks to be you</i>

114
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:19,814
<i>Sucks to be you,
sucks to be you</i>

115
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:24,253
We can't afford
a babysitter every day.

116
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:25,776
Bart will have to come along.

117
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,517
And Maggie too.

118
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:28,692
Well, I got to ask.

119
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:32,914
Should we really sacrifice
everything for a gifted child?

120
00:06:32,957 --> 00:06:35,699
We'll always regret it
if we don't.

121
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:38,136
- Okay.
- I wanted you to argue with me.

122
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,662
Youth orchestra costs
$200 a month.

123
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:43,664
Where's that money
gonna come from?

124
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:46,797
Well, I have an idea,
but you might not like it.

125
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:48,495
Remember the show Breaking Bad?

126
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:50,932
About a dad
who was desperate for money?

127
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:52,629
Homer, no.

128
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:54,588
Marge, yes, I can do it.

129
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:56,285
I can sell my box set.

130
00:06:56,328 --> 00:06:58,722
We haven't even listened
to the commentaries.

131
00:06:58,766 --> 00:06:59,723
Okay, not that.

132
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,725
I could always switch
to a double shift

133
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:03,118
and work nights at the plant.

134
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:05,033
Isn't that dangerous
to your health?

135
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:06,687
You think I'm in danger?

136
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,341
I am the danger.
I'm the one who knocks.

137
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:10,908
Well, that's so protective.

138
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:13,084
It's also a quote
from Breaking Bad.

139
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:16,871
You are really far behind.

140
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:33,496
And Jesus said

141
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,932
unto the Samaritan woman...

142
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:44,202
Good, good.
When the Spanish station

143
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:47,641
overpowers the Christian one,
we're getting close to the city.

144
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:49,381
Why do I have to be here?

145
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:51,340
I specifically
didn't get good at anything

146
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:53,211
to avoid drives like this.

147
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:56,301
If you were me,
would you trust you home alone?

148
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:08,705
- Who's the new girl?
- What does she play?

149
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:10,359
Too small for a tuba.

150
00:08:10,402 --> 00:08:12,883
- Too big for a flute.
- Well, maybe it's her lunch.

151
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:15,364
Hi. I'm Lisa Simpson.

152
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:17,540
He might hear you.

153
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:20,456
- Are you okay?
- Don't tell him I'm sick.

154
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,936
The sick are left to die.

155
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,028
Wow, even the violas are tense.

156
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,553
Everyone, say hello
to Lisa Simpson.

157
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:32,555
She's an actual musician,
so she will be

158
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,166
a strange and wonderful creature
to the rest of you.

159
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,559
We'll start with
one of the classics.

160
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:39,475
Theme from Knight Rider,
second movement, bar 47.

161
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,477
One, two, three, four.

162
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:47,396
I may have misspoken.

163
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:49,224
Miss Simpson,
was that an F sharp

164
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:51,574
or a G flat that you played?

165
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:53,141
Well, that's a trick question,

166
00:08:53,184 --> 00:08:55,404
because they're the same.

167
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:57,928
Oh, we have a music scholar
in our midst.

168
00:08:57,972 --> 00:08:59,713
You're right, they are the same.

169
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:03,020
And if only you had played
either one of them!

170
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:04,935
Sorry?

171
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:06,676
No, no, no. It's my fault.

172
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,460
I've been too soft on you, Lisa.

173
00:09:08,504 --> 00:09:10,811
I've been letting you coast
for almost two minutes.

174
00:09:10,854 --> 00:09:13,640
That ends now. Lisa alone,
theme from Moonlighting,

175
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:15,467
second movement, andante!

176
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,738
Bart.

177
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:26,653
- Bart.
- Just killing time.

178
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:32,528
Lisa.

179
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,530
Lisa, sweetie, are you okay?

180
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,707
He yelled at me, humiliated me
in front of everyone.

181
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:38,882
And then...

182
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:41,624
I never played better!

183
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:44,975
Aw, so we're doing this
every day?

184
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:47,412
- I guess so.
- Oh, man.

185
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:49,414
I've already got
seat cushion butt.

186
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,112
Look. I sat on a nickel.

187
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:52,679
You can see the date.

188
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:55,464
That's a buffalo nickel.

189
00:09:55,507 --> 00:09:56,683
It's really valuable.

190
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:57,988
Threw it in the gutter.

191
00:09:58,032 --> 00:10:00,121
Coins are boring.

192
00:10:07,302 --> 00:10:10,131
Hey, welcome to the night shift.
What are you in for?

193
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:11,698
Because I hit the jackpot.

194
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:14,875
My kid's got a big future
with the jazz.

195
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:17,660
Oh, I hear you, you'll do
anything for your kids.

196
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:19,053
Then they turn on you.

197
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:21,664
Well, I am through.
Happily estranged.

198
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:25,146
Is that my kids?
Oh, boy.

199
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:26,713
Steam valve.

200
00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:28,497
It's never them.

201
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,847
It's pretty dark in here.
Can we turn on some more lights?

202
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:33,676
No, the company
can't afford the power.

203
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,286
Aren't we a power company?

204
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,681
Never get high
on your own supply.

205
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:45,035
Mom, I think Maggie
wants to go home.

206
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:47,342
Maggie, is that what you want?

207
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:53,783
Let's go home! Let's go home!

208
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:55,785
I'm sorry, is this annoying you?

209
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:58,919
Ma'am, day care is happy
to watch your son.

210
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:00,834
Bart Simpson,
well-behaved child.

211
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:01,791
Please don't Google me.

212
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:03,401
In you go!

213
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:07,971
Who are you losers, and
why am I locked in here with you?

214
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:09,059
We're the siblings.

215
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:11,583
Our brothers and sisters
are the talented ones.

216
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:14,978
Do you know what it's like
being second banana to a third chair?

217
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:16,980
Shut up, Miles.

218
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,244
Hey, I don't belong here.

219
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:24,858
You're one of us.

220
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:29,079
One of us. One of us.

221
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:31,821
- Afterthought.
- Also-ran.

222
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:32,953
Second string.

223
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:35,738
Unwanted child.

224
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:41,309
You're pretty well-dressed
for a kid.

225
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:42,963
I'm a parent.

226
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:45,617
A prize-winning novelist
with no musical talent.

227
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:49,186
All right,
first order of business,

228
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,579
do we have any chair challenges?

229
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:52,755
Excuse me,
what's a chair chall...

230
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,757
Great, our first volunteer,
out for blood.

231
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:57,804
Lisa versus Brian,
winner gets first chair.

232
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:00,894
- Lisa, how could you?
- No, I didn't mean to.

233
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:03,897
Go, go, go, or I'll call you
both Ubers back to Loser Town.

234
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,464
Damn it, surge pricing.
I'll call it in later. Go!

235
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,906
I've heard enough.

236
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:15,909
Brian, that was perfect...
for second chair.

237
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:17,998
Lisa, you have his spot.

238
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,174
- I had a good run.
- No, you didn't.

239
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:22,176
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

240
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:24,352
Never apologize for talent.

241
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:26,702
Did Mozart apologize?
I don't know. I wasn't there.

242
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,835
And even if I was,
I'd have been pushing a plow.

243
00:12:28,878 --> 00:12:30,837
You think everyone gets
to hang out with Mozart?

244
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:36,364
Whoo-hoo! First chair.

245
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,066
Well, I'm off
to the night shift.

246
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,461
I'll miss you most of all,
prime-time TV.

247
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:49,812
- Dad, do my feelings matter?
- Of course they do.

248
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:52,467
We just don't have as much
time for them as usual.

249
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,904
Go ahead, tell me
what you're thinking.

250
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:56,906
- Well, I...
- I hear you, I understand you.

251
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,647
- And I love you.
- But I...

252
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,867
Just put the rest
on my Father's Day card.

253
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,694
I'll see you at breakfast.

254
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,960
There's nothing worse
than being the parent

255
00:13:07,003 --> 00:13:09,005
of a kid with promise.

256
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:12,879
Oh, gosh.
I've been so selfish.

257
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:15,925
That's right. The only one
who should monopolize

258
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:17,971
this family's time
and attention is me,

259
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:19,755
because I could go
at any moment.

260
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,191
Unless I keep talking.

261
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:22,976
Talking, talking, talking.

262
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:25,282
That's what keeps
the grim reaper at bay.

263
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:30,897
I saw quite a bit of the
grim reaper back in the war.

264
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,552
Back then, we called him
The Ticket Out of Germany.

265
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:38,208
But the seating was cramped
and the food was lousy.

266
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:41,603
And that was the start
of American Airlines.

267
00:13:45,038 --> 00:13:47,636
¿Accidentes? No problema.

268
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:50,699
Teléfono ocho-ocho-ocho
ocho-ocho...

269
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:53,745
Maggie, what are you doing?

270
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:56,748
I'll help her, Mom.

271
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:58,750
Help! Help!

272
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:01,710
I was promised ice cream
50 miles ago.

273
00:14:01,753 --> 00:14:04,408
We're here.

274
00:14:09,718 --> 00:14:11,372
Homie?

275
00:14:11,415 --> 00:14:13,809
Everything's breakfast
all the time.

276
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,943
Eggs.
All I'm eating are eggs.

277
00:14:16,986 --> 00:14:19,815
I think it's turning
my skin yellow.

278
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,774
Homie, are we sacrificing
our family's happiness

279
00:14:22,818 --> 00:14:24,733
for the sake of one member?

280
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:26,735
When Lisa's making
millions of dollars

281
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:30,043
playing for the Utah Jazz,
it will be worth it.

282
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:33,046
The Jazz is a basketball team.

283
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:34,830
No, it's...

284
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:43,491
Oh, my God, what have we done?

285
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:14,435
Okay, listen up,
you guys want to be

286
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:16,350
in your siblings' shadows
your whole life?

287
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:17,612
Yes.

288
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:19,353
It's cool in the shadow.

289
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:21,181
Well, I'm gonna tell you
how to get attention.

290
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:23,183
- Are you sure?
- That sounds risky.

291
00:15:23,226 --> 00:15:25,011
I don't know about that.

292
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:27,013
Here's what you do,
misbehave.

293
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:28,797
Call your dad by his first name.

294
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,755
If it's sticky, spill it.

295
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,062
Make a shirttail wiener.

296
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:34,324
- Yes!
- I'll do it!

297
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:35,456
Yeah!

298
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:37,197
Simpson, a word?

299
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,374
About your time with this band,
I am afraid it's almost up.

300
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:41,853
Are you kicking me out?

301
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:43,768
I wish.
Ending people's musical careers

302
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:45,074
is why I got into music.

303
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:46,858
But no, your sin
is having a birthday soon.

304
00:15:46,902 --> 00:15:48,991
You have to audition to move up
to the next group.

305
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:51,254
- How old are they?
- Nine to 14.

306
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:52,821
And then what's the group
after that?

307
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:54,823
Fame, fortune,
an affair with Hans Zimmer.

308
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:57,913
Well, sir, I'm ready
for all but the last one.

309
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,262
You think you're ready?
In nine to 14,

310
00:15:59,306 --> 00:16:01,134
we play notes
you've never heard of.

311
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:04,050
M-flat, J-sharp, V, cursive G,
Frank, Frank Natural.

312
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:06,269
And those are just
the ones you can hear.

313
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:08,010
I know you're playing
mental games with me,

314
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:09,881
and I take it as flattery.

315
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:12,449
Smart. Always smart.
Well, this isn't a game!

316
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:14,147
It will cost your parents
more money,

317
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,279
and it's a half hour
farther from everywhere.

318
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:19,456
Oh, well, I guess I better
talk to my family then,

319
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,720
and tell them the...
the good news.

320
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:24,461
Auditions are Tuesday.
I sense you're conflicted.

321
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:26,811
I was conflicted once.
Band leader or prison guard?

322
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:30,293
I chose the one
where I could be more cruel.

323
00:16:31,903 --> 00:16:35,081
So tired and irritable.

324
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:37,779
Shut up. You shut up.

325
00:17:19,342 --> 00:17:20,648
The usual, sir?

326
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:21,779
Thank you, Lloyd.

327
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:23,477
And let me say, no one enables

328
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,696
a descent into madness
better than you.

329
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,133
I understand the family's

330
00:17:27,176 --> 00:17:29,352
getting to be
a bit of a problem.

331
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:31,963
Yeah, but what are you gonna do?

332
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:35,576
I hear radiation poisoning
is a painless way to go.

333
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:39,362
Maybe sprinkle a little
plutonium in the salad.

334
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:41,799
- I don't eat salad.
- Exactly.

335
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:44,541
I see.

336
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:48,328
- No, I don't.
- Kill your family.

337
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:50,678
- How do I do that?
- With the plutonium.

338
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:53,246
- Well, where do I put it?
- In the salad.

339
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:56,988
- To what end?
- To kill your family!

340
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:59,687
Just what are you driving at?

341
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:12,613
Simpson, what the hell
are you doing?

342
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:14,354
Get back to your post.

343
00:18:14,397 --> 00:18:15,703
Geez, I nearly went insane

344
00:18:15,746 --> 00:18:19,054
just to put my kid
in an after-school music class.

345
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,838
I'm beginning to think
it's not worth it.

346
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:23,363
- Please, don't fire me.
- Oh, don't worry.

347
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:26,409
What happens on the night shift
stays on the night shift.

348
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:28,411
I'm not gonna hurt you.

349
00:18:28,455 --> 00:18:31,414
I'm just gonna
bash your brains in.

350
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:35,070
There's our head
of human resources now.

351
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:39,944
Well, this is it.

352
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:43,426
If she makes it, it's five more
years at least of driving.

353
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,777
I gave Maggie a Sketch 'n' Etch
to calm her down.

354
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:49,606
Oh, my God,
she has talent too.

355
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,348
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

356
00:18:53,654 --> 00:18:55,786
Make something else.

357
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:00,748
I'm doing it.
I'm gonna make it.

358
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:04,230
Oh, but if I keep
being this good,

359
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:07,842
it will mean more practice
and more driving

360
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:11,193
and more resentful looks
from the baby.

361
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:13,326
Wonder what I'm gonna do.

362
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,719
I hate defining moments.

363
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:23,336
Stop! That's it, you failed.

364
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:24,859
Have fun playing
for nickels on the street

365
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:26,208
at the corner
of Good But Not Great

366
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:27,383
and Disappointment Boulevard.

367
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:29,124
You don't exist for me anymore.

368
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,126
You're pretty mean
for a teacher.

369
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,172
Yeah. You should see me
as a father.

370
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:35,783
So, guess this is the last time

371
00:19:35,826 --> 00:19:37,785
we're doing this drive.

372
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:39,830
Lisa, are you okay?

373
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:41,832
Sure. Fine. Never been better.

374
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:44,879
You weren't crazy enough
to fail on purpose

375
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:47,229
just to make life better
for the rest of us?

376
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:49,579
I'm fine.
Probably, if I'd gotten it,

377
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:52,800
all that work would have
killed my love for music.

378
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:55,716
Or I think you would have gotten
better and loved it more.

379
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,458
I know I loved that.

380
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:00,503
And I love
that I drove you to violence.

381
00:20:01,765 --> 00:20:03,637
Don't make me come back there!

382
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,160
You wouldn't fit, fatso.

383
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,509
Oh, wouldn't I?

384
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,387
Maggie, are we good?

385
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:33,470
Why does this car
always smell of cheese puffs?

386
00:20:33,514 --> 00:20:35,995
Is someone sad-snacking
when he drives alone?

387
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:38,127
It's not like I have anyone
making me breakfast.

388
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:39,955
But we're almost home,
so close your eyes.

389
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:41,130
There's a big surprise.

390
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:43,045
- Come on, close them.
- This is silly.

391
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:44,220
Close them!

392
00:20:44,264 --> 00:20:46,048
Oh, Petal.

393
00:20:46,092 --> 00:20:48,007
Surprise.

394
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,226
A man, for me?

395
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:53,055
No. I changed the locks,
and I'm kicking you out.

396
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:56,276
But-but who gets Sir Winston?

397
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,147
His name is Poochini.

398
00:20:58,191 --> 00:20:59,888
Very well. Poochini it is.

399
00:21:01,237 --> 00:21:04,640
That's all I ever wanted.
I love you.
