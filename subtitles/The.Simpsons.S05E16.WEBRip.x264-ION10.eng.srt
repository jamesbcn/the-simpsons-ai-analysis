00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,078
Wow, thanks.

173
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,082
Now I have four children.

174
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,245
You will be called
"Stitchface."

175
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:26,415
Wow, Flanders. This is about the nicest
thing anyone's ever done for me.

176
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,724
Ooh, I guess it's time
for me to duck again.

177
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,641
No! I want everyone
to know that

178
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,641
this is Ned Flanders,
my friend!

179
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,484
-What did he say?
-I don't know.

180
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,849
Something about being gay.

181
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,735
Homer,
that's our wedding photo.

182
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,280
Marge, quit living
in the past.

183
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,074
(groans)

184
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,027
Heydilly-ho, window buddy.
Just wondering if you'd like

185
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,987
to come over and give
the new pool table a whirl.

186
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,408
I'll be there.

187
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,206
And this time
you can be the nacho man.

188
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,745
Dad and Ned Flanders friends?
Heh. What's next?

189
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,797
A's on Bart's report card?

190
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,386
Hey!

191
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,677
Uh, be careful there, Homer.
That is sort of a new table.

192
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:20,807
(chuckles)

193
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,233
Watch this, Ned.

194
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,231
They don't call me
Springfield Fats

195
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,113
just because
I'm morbidly obese.

196
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,990
(gasps)

197
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,948
Now you got a lawsuit
on your hands.

198
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,698
Just kidding.

199
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,450
<i>-What's wrong, Jeremiah?</i>
<i>-It's not fair.</i>

200
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,204
<i>My brother Joseph</i>
<i>has a sin to confess.</i>

201
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,207
<i>I wish I had one too.</i>

202
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,169
<i>Oh, don't you see?</i>
<i>You do have a sin to confess.</i>

203
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,671
<i>The sin of envy.</i>

204
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:51,133
<i>(bleating)</i>

205
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,675
<i>That's all well and</i>
<i>good for sheep,</i>

206
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,758
<i>but what are</i>
<i>we to do?</i>

207
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:55,894
Boring!
Let's watch something else.

208
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,350
Aww!

209
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,970
Now, boys.

210
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,426
Mr. Simpson is the guest.
He gets to decide what to watch.

211
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,517
-Yeah.
-(clicking remote control)

212
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,975
Hey, what gives?
I thought you had a satellite dish.

213
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:12,145
Sure didilly do.
Over 230 channels locked out.

214
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,196
Okay, boys, time for bed.
Say good night.

215
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,990
Good night, Daddy!
Good night, Uncle Homer!

216
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,825
Oh, Uncle Homer.

217
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,370
Ned, since you've let me
spend time with your family,

218
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,326
I want you
to get to know my family.

219
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,924
-Hey, everyone!
-Hey.

220
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:36,177
I'd like to introduce
Ned Flanders, my best friend.

221
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,060
Hey, I don't want no people in here
with their "Evils of alcohol" Rap.

222
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:45,189
Wait a second. You're the man at
the hospital who reads to sick children.

223
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:51,149
"And truly, she was my friend Flicka."
(sniffs)

224
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,113
-(gasps)
-If this gets out, the next words you say

225
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,574
will be muffled
by your own butt!

226
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,105
(tires screech)

227
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,778
Honey, I'm so glad
you're home.

228
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,986
Can't talk. See Flanders.

229
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,996
-Later sex.
-(groaning)

230
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,249
Bless the grocer
for this wonderful meat,

231
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,421
the middleman
who jacked up the price.

232
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,130
And let's not forget
the humane but determined boys

233
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,460
over at the slaughterhouse.

234
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,464
Hiya, Flanders.
Ooh, dinner.

235
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,506
May I join you?
(grunts)

236
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,008
-(gasps)
-Mmm.

237
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,055
(gasps)

238
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,518
(chuckling) Homer,
I'd love to chitty-chat,

239
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,558
but tonight's the night
I do my charity work.

240
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,192
Uh, yeah.
A judge made me do that once too.

241
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,189
Stupid lack
of public urinals.

242
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:32,111
Hey, just so you don't
have to suffer alone,

243
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,191
I'm coming with you!

244
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,985
Oh-- Heh, well--

245
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,860
(chuckles)
That sounds super duper.

246
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,040
Oh, you poor,
unfortunate man.

247
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,383
Let's get you out of
those clothes immediately.

248
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,878
And we'll do whatever we can
about the smell.

249
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,051
But I-- All right.

250
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,800
Oh, come on!
We've been here for 15 minutes.

251
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,224
Can't you see they're
sucking the life out of us?

252
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,853
Homer, maybe you'd have
more fun at Moe's tonight.

253
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,232
Ah, for some reason, Moe's always
closed on Wednesdays.

254
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,810
{\an8}"And then they realized
they were no longer little girls.

255
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,025
They were little women."
(sniffs)

256
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,992
Come on. Come on!

257
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,535
Just give 'em the slop
and let's get out of here.

258
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,538
Oh, I can do it
faster than that!

259
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,710
Mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm.
Mmm, mmm.

260
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,790
Wow!
Look at that enthusiasm!

261
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,286
This is front-page material.

262
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,471
Homie, I'm very proud
of you.

263
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,300
But don't you think you're spending
too much time with Ned?

264
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,466
Your family
needs you too.

265
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,265
Oh, of course you'd say
something like that, Marge.

266
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,348
You've hated Ned for years.

267
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,944
In fact, you wanted to
bash his head in with a pipe.

268
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,310
That was you!

269
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,106
Love, Marge.
Don't hate. Love.

270
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,151
The Flanders are
a bunch of geeks, man.

271
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,284
The "Flandereses"
are not geeks!

272
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,531
Okay. Rod and Todd are.
And the wife has a thing for me.

273
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,284
But she hides it behind a mask
of low-key hostility.

274
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,576
But we've got to
give this thing a chance.

275
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,920
I want the two families to take
a trip together this weekend.

276
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,498
-No way, Jose.
-Yes way.

277
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,503
Don't worry, Bart.
It seems like every week

278
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,545
something odd happens
to the Simpsons.

279
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,299
My advice is to ride it out,

280
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,090
make an occasional
smart-aleck quip,

281
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,224
and by next week, we'll be back
to where we started from,

282
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,891
ready for another
wacky adventure.

283
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,349
<i>-Ay, caramba!</i>
-That's the spirit.

284
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,308
Don't worry.

285
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,481
I brought my
"Rappin' Ronnie Reagan" tape.

286
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,900
It always makes
the trip go faster.

287
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,819
<i>♪ Well, well, well ♪</i>

288
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,108

289
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,492

You know something?

290
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,949
He did say "well" A lot.

293
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,871

keep going.

294
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,537
More. More.
Right there. Let her go.

295
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:01,512
Okay, let's go boating!

296
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,850
-How are my boys doin', Homer?
-They're fine.

297
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,808
There. I hope the children
enjoy my special fruit punch.

298
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,480
We got the recipe from
the fruit punch advisory board.

299
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,400
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.
Our boys don't eat sugar.

300
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,269
But why would the advisory board
give us bad advice?

301
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,397
-No sugar!
-(both groaning)

302
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,235
Thank you,
but we're not allowed.

303
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:27,451
Ah, it's okay.
There's no sugar in pixie sticks.

304
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,543
-Trust me.
-Okay. Hmm.

305
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,247
-Don't hog it all, smelly head!
-Go to hell, zit face!

306
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,501
-Give me that sugar cane!
-(both groaning)

307
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,375
(cackling)

308
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,630
I'd like to propose a toast
to the coming together

309
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,086
of the Simpsons
and the Flanders.

310
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,257
If this were
a more perfect world,

311
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:52,266
we'd all be known
as the Flimpsons.

312
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:56,899
So here's to
my best friend, Ned.

313
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,519
(sighs)
Well, sir,

314
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,068
my entire family
is very touched and--

315
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,862
-Food fight!
-BART: Yeah!

316
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:06,856
HOMER: <i>♪ Da-na-na</i>
<i>na-na-na-na, na-na ♪</i>

317
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,277

00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,865

319
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,745

320
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,415
-Whatcha doin'?
-We're headin' back.

321
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,538
Todd's got Zesty Italian
in his eye.

322
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:22,416
Okay. But at least let me take
the boat out for one last spin.

323
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,014
-Oh, I don't know.
-Too late!

324
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,760
(groans) Oh, Lord,
please give me the strength

325
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,014
to endure
Homer Simpson's friendship.

326
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,556
-(boat engine revving)
-(Homer shouting)

327
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,771

328
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,560
Hmm, your car.

329
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,645
Boy, what are the odds, huh?
(chuckling)

330
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,651
Cheers to Homer Simpson
for all his recent charity work!

331
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,744
ALL: Yea!

There's Homer.
There's Homer too.

337
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,377
That's also Homer.
That's Homer!

338
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,966
Huh?
(groans)

339
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,722
-(shouts)
-What's the matter, Ned?

340
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,595
I-- I think I hate
Homer Simpson.

341
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,773
(gasps)

342
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,060
(yells)

343
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:22,363
Marge, I think I
hate Ted Koppel.

344
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,729
No, wait. I find him
informative and witty.

345
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,608
Night.
(snoring)

346
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,365
-Off the rim!
-Oh! Almost.

347
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,701
Boy, that was close.

348
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,706
Hey, what's up
for today, Neddy?

349
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,708
Uh-- (sighs)

350
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,290
Ah, Homer, we're gonna visit
the boys' grandmother.

351
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,836
Family only, you know?

352
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,669
-Right. No reporters.
-(Ned sighs)

353
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,974
No. I-- I-- I mean
just the Flanders family.

354
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,426
Oh, okay.

355
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,523
Oh, boy! Grandma!

356
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,769
-We're not going anywhere.
-But you said--

357
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,272
Uh, sometimes to keep from
hurting someone's feelings,

358
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,645
we have to say things
that aren't exactly--

359
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,613
Lies make
baby Jesus cry.

360
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,113
(sighs)

361
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:16,163
Neddy! Neddy!

362
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:19,163
Let's get in a quick nine
down at the Pitch 'n' Putt.

363
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,576
(engine revving,
tires screeching)

364
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,535
Neddy! Neddy!

365
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,086
-(groaning)
-He's gaining on us!

366
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,011
-I'm scared!
-(crying)

367
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,589
Come on, Ned!
Move this thing!

368
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,144
I can't! It's a Geo!

369
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,388
(grunting)

370
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,430
(screaming)

371
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,100
-(groaning)
-(groaning)

372
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,396
(groaning)

373
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,399
Hmm. I guess
he didn't see me.

374
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,441
We did it!
We got rid of--

375
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,574
(siren blaring)

376
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,735
(chuckling)
I told you, officer.

377
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,662
I'm not hepped up
on goofballs.

378
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,702
Yeah, right.

379
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:02,496
{\an8}Ned Flanders.
I never would have imagined.

380
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,091
{\an8}(gasping)

381
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,248
Oh-- Oh-- Ah--

382
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,587
Oh-- Oof!

383
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:12,341
High as a kite, everybody!
Goofballs!

384
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,469
Yeah, where's your messiah
now, Flanders? Ah.

385
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:21,274
(bells tolling)

386
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,190
Oh, I can't do it, Maude.

387
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,519
I can't face
their accusing eyes.

388
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,355
Oh, don't worry, Ned.

389
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,190
This is a house
of love and forgiveness.

390
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,700
-There he is, Ned Flanders.
-The fallen one.

391
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,701
The evil one.

392
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,532
I bet he's the one that wrote
"Homer" all over the bathroom.

393
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,077
Oh, I think
we should leave.

394
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:45,581
Hey, Flanders, over here!
I got us some kick-ass seats!

395
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,206
(moans)

396
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,261
(clearing throat)

397
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,300
Before I get started
on today's sermon, entitled

398
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,845
"What Ned did,"

399
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:03,349
I'd like to publicly congratulate
Homer Simpson on his recent charity work.

400
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,603
-(applauding)
-(kissing)

401
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,596
I live to give.

402
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,558
(moans)

403
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,767
That's beautiful.
We appreciate the kisses.

404
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:16,108
Now, let us bow our heads
in a silent prayer of thanksgiving.

405
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,498
(nose whistling)

406
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,035
(whistling continues)

407
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,554
Stop it! Breathe through
your damn mouth!

408
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,182
-Oh!
-(gasping)

409
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,799
Oh, can't you see
this man isn't a hero?

410
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,556
He's annoying.
He's very, very annoying!

411
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,519
Well, Ned Flanders
is just jealous.

412
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,100
Ah, the guy's hepped up
on goofballs.

413
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:51,356
Let's sacrifice him
to our god!

414
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,530
Come on. We did it all
the time in the '30s.

415
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:57,149
(chattering)

416
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:00,907
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!

417
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:01,951
(gasps)

418
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,544
How dare you talk about
Ned Flanders like that.

419
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,751
He's a wonderful,
kind, caring man.

420
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,502
Maybe even more so than me.

421
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,415
There have been times
when I lost patience with him,

422
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,424
even lashed out at him,

423
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:21,546
but this man has turned
every cheek on his body.

424
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,717
If everyone here
were like Ned Flanders,

425
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,176
there'd be no need
for heaven.

426
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,187
We'd already be there.

427
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,112
(group sighs)

428
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:35,939
(clears throat)
Um--

429
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,736
Well, I think we all owe
Ned a heartfelt apology.

430
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,031
We were wrong
to doubt him.

431
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,235
-Hey, that guy's right!
-Yeah.

432
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,906
(chattering)

433
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,206
That was a very nice thing
you did, Homie.

434
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:55,802
(sniffs)
Thank you.

435
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,469
Thank you so much,
Homer.

436
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,968
You really are a--
(sniffs)

437
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:05,682
-You're a true friend.
-Right back at ya, buddy.

438
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:09,184
(moans) Now, how about
that game at the Pitch 'N' Putt?

439
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,138
Just try and stop me.

440
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,188
I don't get it, Lise. You said everything
would be back to normal.

441
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,613
But Homer and Flanders
are still friends.

442
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:20,742
Yeah. Maybe this means the
end of our wacky adventures.

443
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,198
Guess what, everyone!

444
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,655
My great-uncle Boris died

445
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,414
and left us
his old country house!

446
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,246
There's only one catch.
They say it's haunted.

447
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,792
But I'm sure
we can prove 'em wrong

448
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,085
by spending the weekend there.

449
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,089
-Hididilly-ho, neighbor!
-Get lost, Flanders.

450
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,132
Okilly-dokilly.

451
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,644
(both sigh)

452
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,640
-(wolf howling)
-(bat screeching)

453
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:51,523
HOMER: See, I told ya.
There's nothin' to worry about.

454
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,811
-This place isn't--
-(Simpsons scream)

455
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,282
Shh!
