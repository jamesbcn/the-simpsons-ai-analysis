00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:03,181
(muttering)

180
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:07,352
Babe, Lisa's making
the noises again.

181
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:11,124
Lisa, would it violate
the spirit of mental health

182
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:15,234
and self-care for you to squelch
all your feelings?

183
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:18,469
Scientists are saying
they're gonna eat our crops.

184
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,065
No more kale.

185
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,337
We need to get Lisa
off the Internet.

186
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:26,566
Go to the attic
and give her you-know-what.

187
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,343
Merry Christmas.

188
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,882
Why am I getting
my big present now?

189
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:34,618
Because Santa delivered it
early this year.

190
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,075
Really? Why?

191
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,153
Because he-he doesn't
have long to live.

192
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:39,992
Dad.
The world is falling apart.

193
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,587
You can't just
distract me with a toy.

194
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,690
(gasps)

195
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,691
You were saying?

196
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,463
I'm distracted. I'm distracted.

197
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:54,637
This is
the 1958 Blossom Festival.

198
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:58,605
The official petal that year
was the hollyhock.

199
00:08:58,605 --> 00:08:59,905
Fascinating.

200
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:03,137
<i>And why was
Marilyn Monroe there?</i>

201
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,053
AGNES:
Oh, that's me.

202
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,745
You charmer. (laughs)

203
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:10,018
What is this exquisite quilt?

204
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:12,147
AGNES:
Oh, that's
an old family heirloom.

205
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:15,522
Handstitched quilts are
quite valuable these days.

206
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:19,162
- Oh! Ooh!
- Generations of Skinner women

207
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:22,033
have contributed images
of the sons

208
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,962
who disappointed them.

209
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,634
It radiates a beauty

210
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,102
unmarred by the passing years.

211
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,041
Much like its owner.

212
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:31,967
It's yours.
I want you to have it.

213
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,172
(dishes breaks)

214
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:36,143
Mother!
You promised the quilt to me.

215
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:38,413
<i>You can't give away
my birthright.</i>

216
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,382
I can give whatever I want
to whoever says nice things.

217
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:44,351
You know what Seymour
gave me for my birthday?

218
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:47,151
Half a computer.
No keyboard.

219
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,764
It's a tablet device.
It has a touchscreen.

220
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,157
(sputters) Touchscreen.

221
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,629
Sounds made-up to me.

222
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:55,597
Just like his prom date.

223
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:56,926
You met Charlene.

224
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,930
You spit on a Kleenex
and wiped her makeup off.

225
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,643
<i>(laughing)</i>

226
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:08,184
Hey, after hot yoga,
let's grab some vegan Thai,

227
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:11,305
then check out
the Swedish gut biome clinic.

228
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,051
(high-pitched voice):
But first, let's ride

229
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,916
the real working escalator.

230
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:19,186
Ooh! It's a girls' day.

231
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:21,286
Who wants a spot of boba tea?

232
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,118
I do.

233
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,792
This feels so good.

234
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:25,061
Maybe Mom's right.

235
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:27,258
Maybe I don't need to freak out.

236
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,933
Oh, but you do.

237
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,632
(gasps) You're alive?

238
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:36,844
Lisa, how can you just...
I don't know... play

239
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,437
as the world
is collapsing around us?

240
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,779
How are you talking to me?
(chuckles weakly)

241
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,875
How do you know
about the lockdown?

242
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:47,048
Lisa, we may be born to shop,

243
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,417
but we're not, like, unaware.

244
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:50,546
No, of course, but...

245
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:53,291
It's just so hard
to feel present right now,

246
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:56,917
isn't it? Not when
those things are out there.

247
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:59,864
Can we not talk about
the caterpillars?

248
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,030
This is the first time
in two days

249
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,299
I've been free
of crushing anxiety and...

250
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:06,068
Oh, my God, the caterpillars

251
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,136
have caused a lettuce shortage.

252
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:12,035
Rioters were tear-gassed
at a Whole Foods salad bar.

253
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,439
That's so sad.

254
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,911
I'm just gonna say it.

255
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,849
I think this is the new normal.

256
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,805
(whimpering)
Oh. Oh, no.

257
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,323
Oh, no.

258
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,590
Look, Maggie.

259
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,785
Daddy's got delicious
ranch dressing right here.

260
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:30,658
(gagging)

261
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,587
Now baby's turn.

262
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,400
Good Maggie!
Great Daddy.

263
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:41,165
(crying)

264
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:44,038
<i>MARGE:
Look at Ned. His kids
don't know what it's like</i>

265
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,007
<i>to live in a world
without ranch.</i>

266
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:48,076
<i>But getting angry
won't help anything.</i>

267
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:49,775
<i>I'm gonna be the bigger person.</i>

268
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,446
(Maggie crying)

269
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,076
Screw this!

270
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,881
Tonight, we're breaking
into Ned's basement

271
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,653
and cleaning that sucker out.

272
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:58,751
Babe?

273
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,992
Get the bolt cutters.

274
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,900
<i>Mother, how can you give my
quilt to this scheming Adonis?</i>

275
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:13,031
Agnes, I'll treasure the quilt

276
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,803
like it deserves
to be treasured.

277
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,442
Like you deserve
to be treasured.

278
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,007
Oh, you.

279
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:21,206
(laughs, snorts)

280
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,078
Let me fix you
another liverwurst melt.

281
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,247
Great. That's just great.

282
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,416
Mm...

283
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,156
Oh, my God.

284
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,631
That quilt was baby Skinner's
security blanket.

285
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,927
<i>My beloved Mr. Nuck-nuck.</i>

286
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,470
<i>(crying)</i>

287
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:46,625
Huh?

288
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,543
Skinner's crying?

289
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:49,865
Can he do that?

290
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,040
That quilt was his blankie.

291
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,239
You don't... (sniffs)

292
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,410
you don't take away
a man's blankie!

293
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:57,879
Make Mr. Purple Shirt
stop crying

294
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:59,278
so he can sit at his desk

295
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,779
and tell recess to happen.

296
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,722
No, guys.
We're not doing this.

297
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,047
We're not feeling bad
for Skinner.

298
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:07,492
We're not gonna see him
as a human being.

299
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,617
<i>ALL:
Mm...</i>

300
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:12,331
<i>(crying)</i>

301
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:13,786
All right, fine.

302
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,734
I can't believe I'm saying this.

303
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:17,029
We're gonna help our principal

304
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,670
get his blankie back.

305
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:24,965
So, anybody feel like
doing some shopping?

306
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:26,372
(chuckles weakly)

307
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,983
No time, Lisa.

308
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:29,405
We're building a barricade

309
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,080
in case the caterpillars
get inside.

310
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,919
That does look really safe.

311
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:37,745
Kind of wish I was
in there with you.

312
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,121
(shutter clicks)

313
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,899
Hey, girl, welcome to the mall.

00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:50,156

Now, calm down, Ned.

Forgive me, Marge.
Take the dressing.

Lockdown kids of Springfield,

we're gonna save
our principal's blankie.

<i>offering an antique
handmade quilt for sale.</i>

361
00:16:31,859 --> 00:16:34,059
Hmm. If I did have such a quilt,

362
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:36,701
the price would be considerable.

363
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:38,097
Ooh, he's negotiating.

364
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:39,832
The fish is on the hook.

Oh, no, we almost had him.

373
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,323
I am not selling
you my quilt, junior.

374
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,688
Not after all the time
I've spent conning it out of

375
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,557
that awful woman.

376
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:05,826
Ha! Got him.

377
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:07,126
<i>Hello, cousin Peter.</i>

378
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:09,197
Cousin Seymour. Agnes.

379
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,156
We heard every word you said,

380
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,934
right here on my wonderful
half computer,

381
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:17,244
which was a gift from my son.

382
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:22,483
How dare you take advantage
of my sweet, trusting mother?

383
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:24,206
She is an IBS survivor.

384
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,751
Mm. You're a good boy.

385
00:17:26,747 --> 00:17:29,577
And you...

386
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,493
- (grunts)
- Aah!

387
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:33,145
Oh! My orifices!

388
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,593
My precious orific...

389
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:37,019
I don't know who you are,

390
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:39,364
but I thank you
from the bottom of my heart,

391
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,329

You still want your precious

394

MARGE:
Stop!

395
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:52,673
What has lockdown done to us?

396
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:54,073
Hmm?

397
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:57,308

398
00:17:57,311 --> 00:18:00,051

I need Buffalo wings.

399
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:02,547
Ned, you're
a wonderful human being

400
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:05,549
who has never shown
anything but kindness

401
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:08,062
to our challenging family.

402
00:18:08,055 --> 00:18:10,615
I'm sorry.
These are yours.

403
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:12,664
Well, you keep those, Marge.

404
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:13,989
It's time I put the "Christian"

405
00:18:13,994 --> 00:18:16,734
back in "extremist Christian
end times prepper."

406
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:19,374
My dear Homer, I'm so sorry.

407
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,004
(panting) What?

408
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:24,572
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry, too.

409
00:18:25,806 --> 00:18:27,406
We need more furniture.

410
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:28,708
Give me that mannequin.

411
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:31,779
Uh, that's my boyfriend,
Malibu Kevin.

412
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,518
Happy to be of service, babe.

Aah!

Oh, my God, that thing

421
00:18:58,172 --> 00:18:59,672

Ew.

00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:01,013
Ew?

423
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:03,078
Honestly, it's kind of cute.

424
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,176
Maybe you should chill.

425
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:07,049
Chill?
May I remind you

426
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:09,077
that we are in a crisis?

427
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,953
No!
Because that's all you do!

428
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:12,891
Any time there's
a little optimism,

429
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:15,216
here you come
with more bad news,

430
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,822
and squish...
we're all miserable again.

431
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,964
I don't want
to play with you anymore!

432
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:22,361
(all gasp)

433
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:25,172
When we're all stuck indoors
for who knows how long,

434
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:26,765
we have to tell each other

435
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:29,337
things are going to work out.

436
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,306
<i>Because if we all just tell each
other we'll get through this,</i>

437
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:35,336
<i>then by some kind of magic,
we will.</i>

438
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:38,252
<i>And in a crisis,
there's nothing more powerful</i>

439
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:41,815
<i>than showing a little empathy
to the people around you.</i>

440
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:43,345
(as Malibu Stacy):
That is beautiful.

441
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,050
Do you really think
this will be over soon?

442
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:48,023
(regular voice):
Meh, lockdown's
going on forever.

443
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,521
Count on it.

<i>As our long

<i>forget and learn nothing.</i>

451
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:10,708
It's hard to believe we can
just go wherever we'd like.

452
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:12,551
We made it, gang.

453
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:14,476
I always knew we would.
