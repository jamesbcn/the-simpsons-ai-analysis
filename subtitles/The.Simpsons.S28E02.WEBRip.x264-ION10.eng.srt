00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,127
Two-and-a-half children,
wife with current hairstyle.

182
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,248
You're all hired.

183
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,304
Except you, fatso. We don't need a father.

184
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,208
I'll be the rooster in this henhouse.

185
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,837
That is so disappointing.

186
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:49,593
I've always wanted to work for Mr. Burns.

187
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,764
Okay, family scene.

188
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,598
And... action.

189
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,023
(steam hissing)

190
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,101
(sucking noises)

191
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,199
This isn't a word I use lightly,
but... excellent.

192
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,702
Oh, Smithers, one favor:

193
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,123
make the children look like they're mine.

194
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,616
No, no, no! It's too beautiful.

195
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,747
Like a Supreme Court full of Scalias.

196
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,844
Switch to something else.

197
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,513
BURNS: That's good.

198
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,013
What's the matter, Homer?

199
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,354
Last night, Marge and the kids

200
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,469
didn't get home till 11:00 at night.

201
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,806
When I came back from Moe's at 11:05,

202
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,812
they were still taking off their coats!

203
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:43,814
I hear old man Burns is just
living in a fantasy world now.

204
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,268
En garde! (laughs)

205
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,818
Mm, must be nice.

206
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,991
Hey, there he is.
Wonder what he's watching now.

207
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,361
Home movies.

208
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:57,252
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Burnsie ♪</i>

209
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:01,578

210
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,126

211
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,420
(chuckles) Thank you, thank you.

212
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,304
Now, your mother's
going to take me upstairs

213
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,801
to give me... her present.

214
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,178
(Marge moaning suggestively)

215
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,313
BURNS: Oh, Smithers,
could you remove the ankle bar?

216
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,191
More. More. More.

217
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,979
(moans) Oh...

218
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,978
(chuckles) Oh, that was wonderful.

219
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,435
I'm picking up your ten-year options.

220
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,936
Ten years?!

221
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,737
Oh, now, now, no discussion.

222
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,281
We're a family now.

223
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,539
Ugh! What is that? A river otter?

224
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,619
(dog howls)

225
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,456
(groans) We're not coming home, Homie.

226
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,302
What? What do I do without you here?

227
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,628
You can do what you did
with me there: go to Moe's.

228
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,215
Aw, it's not the same

229
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,390
if I'm not trying to avoid
some unpleasant chore.

230
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,679
Oh. You could clean out the attic.

231
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,312
<i>-Going to Moe's!</i>
-(line clicks, dial tone)

232
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,020
Eh, no one to go home to, huh?

233
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,060
Yeah, take it from me, that's rough.

234
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,234
Yeah.

235
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,812
Heading back to an empty house.

236
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,436
No one there to tell you what to do,

237
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,403
no kids fighting all the time.

238
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,443
Wait a minute.

239
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,896
I can eat dinner in any room of the house!

240
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,357
And not the scary ones like
the basement and Bart's bedroom.

241
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,988
And I can drink at home!

242
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,325
Whoa, whoa!
You're twisting my words there.

243
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,791
That would be cheaper!
And I wouldn't have to drive!

244
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,422
And you are kind of mean.

245
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,328
No one calls me mean.

246
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,708
Moe, you're proving my point.

247
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,415
Here we are talking,
and you pull a shotgun on me.

248
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,756
But there's never
any bullets in this. Watch.

249
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,104

Oh, yes. That's hot.

276
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,987
(laughs)
The perfect temperature.

277
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,076

-WOMAN: How you doing?
-Aah!

280
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,380
Don't worry, I've seen you naked

281
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,763
plenty of times.

282
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,510
I live in the house behind yours.

283
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,512
I don't think my wife would like this.

284
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,184
Hey, I got a boyfriend,
and you're not my type.

285
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,724
FLANDERS: Could you both keep it down?

286
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,177
I'm trying to count pennies.

287
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,517
(scoffs) Stupid Flanders.

288
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,312

you're out of beer, pal.

(grunts)

292
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,655
Wow, can a man just be friends

293
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,119
with a woman?

294
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,198
Here are some pretzels.

295
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,373
Yes, he can!

296
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,326
(fence squeaks)

297
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,496
Aw, don't worry. I'll fix that.

298
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,708
Have one. I'm celebrating.

299
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,376
My boyfriend proposed.

300
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,045
Wow! You'll get to enjoy

301
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,393
the most magical part of married life:

302
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,969
the beginning.

303
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,643
Mmm... (slurping)

304
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,893
So, uh, where's the lucky guy?

305
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,435
(sighs) Gone for the weekend.

306
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,558
He's an airline pilot.

307
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,404
Maybe he and I can go out for beers

308
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,270
-before a flight.
-Mm.

309
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,686
Where's your wife?

310
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,895
Uh, she's staying
at this billionaire's house,

311
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,855
working as a virtual reality actress.

312
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,025
You know, the usual.

313
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,199
Oh, Homer?

314
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,912
Something's going on with Homer.

315
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,742
My spousal sense is tingling.

316
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,617
Mom, you blew the take!

317
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,575
Okay, that's it. I'll direct.

318
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,415
And I'll show you how a pro does it.

319
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,421
You, daughter character, say you love me.

320
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,423
(flatly) I love you.

321
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,514
Like you mean it.

322
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,378
(flatly) I really love you.

323
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,505
Once more, with feeling.

324
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,141
(flatly) I... really...

325
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,929
love... you.

326
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:26,933
Blech.

327
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,024
This girl has no chops whatsoever.

328
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,019
(a la Katherine Hepburn)
The existence of my <i>chops</i>

329
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,481
is not for the likes of <i>you</i> to ascertain,

330
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,732
my good sir.

331
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,614
(shudders) Would you like some eggs

332
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,320
with that ham?

333
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,068
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

334
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,204
Looks like the old make-out king's

335
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,411
got a new queen, huh?

336
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,242
Guys, we're just friends.

337
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,037
It's purely catatonic.

338
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,250
"Platonic."

339
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,170
That means she's into me,

340
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,879
but I'm keeping it cool.

341
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,669
I like you, but that's not what it means.

342
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,343
Sure, right.

343
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,591
(Italian accent)
Here you go, the antipasto,

344
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,264
to share.

345
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,592
BOTH: Ooh...!

346
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,508
Would you fellas like to join us?

347
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,926
(nervous stammers)

348
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,809
(sophisticated accent)
When did salad get so awful?

349
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,812
(sophisticated accent)
Kale ruined everything.

350
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,944
(mock sophisticated laughter)

351
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,571
(normal voice)
You're just like a guy.

352
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,648
You're funny, you like to eat crap.

353
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,493
If I may get personal,

354
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,069
-what's your bowling average?
-212.

355
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,624
Oh, my God, you're my best friend!

356
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,029
And that's all.

357
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,027
Just friends.

358
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,408
Eh, we shall see.

359
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,254
There is one test for romance

360
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,369
that never fails.

361
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,036
Enjoy it.

362
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,224
That is not a-love!

363
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,260
This is the best-- we're friends,

364
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,103
no one has any reason to get upset,

365
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,678
and no one gets hurt.

366
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,223
To no one getting hurt.

367
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,557
<i>SMITHERS: Smash-cut to Marge!</i>

368
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,311
"Look, Monty, our daughter, the president,

369
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,064
is delivering her speech."

370
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,266
Excuse me, do I ever get a joke?

371
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,477
Keep rolling.

372
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,277
"Mr. Vice President, Madam Speaker,

years ago, our forefathers,
and <i>foremothers..."</i>

375
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,830
BURNS: Stick to the script.

376
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,410
Oh, you try to give direction

377
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,754
to a bunch of land apes

378
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,169
who aren't worth the ping-pong balls

379
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,458
stuck to their untalented asses!

380
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,292
Idiots! Mountebanks!

381
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,207
Featherwits! Poltroons!

382
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,376
(furniture crashes)

383
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:27,344
Saint Francis himself
would vomit with rage!

384
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,046
Okay, you heard him, people.

385
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,096
That was great, just a little more energy.

386
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,930
Sir, I know you're getting frustrated,

387
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,515
so we recorded some future scenarios.

388
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,941
Yes, let's see what life will be like
when I'm old.

389
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,901
I'm going to build homes for the homeless

390
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,821
with my boyfriend Sean,

391
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,440
then it's off to Vassar in the fall.

392
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,857
<i>Irish</i> boyfriend? <i>Helping</i> the homeless?

393
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,407
Well, every family has one black sheep.

394
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,781
Let's move on.

395
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,077
-How did this happen?
-(pacifier pops twice)

396
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,371
Don't you take that tone with me.

397
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,420
A Harvard man?

398
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,960
I was warned there'd be nausea.

399
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,843
I don't need them. My life is perfect.

400
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,295
My life is perfect.

401
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,545
...49, 50. My life is perfect!

402
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,428
Have you seen my Canadian penny?

403
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,136
Oh, darn it, darn it, darn it!

404
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,109
Everyone out! You're all fired!

405
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,108
Having a family is the most
meaningless experience

406
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,780
I could imagine.

407
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:25,858
Try acting.

408
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,193
Mm...

409
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,107
Come on, kids.

410
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,485
I'm taking my bathrobe.

411
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,951
There's a dye pack stitched in.

412
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,121
(loud pop)

413
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,079
Joke's on you. I like this better.

414
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,039
Oh, go ahead, take your robe.

415
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,830
But you'll never work in single-viewer

416
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,793
virtual reality family melodrama again.

417
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,285
Did you see the guitar lessons sign

418
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,587
on the telephone pole?

419
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,920
I took a tab.

420
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,755
No, I'm not gonna take the lessons,

421
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,090
I just needed to blow my nose.

422
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,385
Ooh, my family's here. Gotta go.

423
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,219
Hey, guys! It's good to see you.

424
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,224
Hmm. Good to see you.

425
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,596
Who were you talking to?

426
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,983
My friend Julia.

427
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,149
<i>Julia?</i> Like a girl?

428
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,308
She's not a girl.

429
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,396
She's three years younger
than your mother.

430
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,361
(irritated murmur)

431
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,031
Now, Marge, it's cool.

432
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,489
All we do is share

433
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,649
our deepest thoughts and feelings.

434
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,778
Mm-hmm.

435
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:15,084
Kids, could you leave the room, please?

436
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,619
Faster!

437
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,663
Geronimo!

438
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,826
(retreating footsteps)

439
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,583
Marge, it's nothing.

440
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,535
She's just my new best friend.

441
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,415
(groans angrily)

442
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,503
What the-- Why--

443
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,168
Why are you mad at those eggs?

444
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,256
They didn't do anything.

445
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,681
Homer Simpson!

446
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,850
(whimpering)

447
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,348
After all I've put up with
for all these years,

448
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,521
if I'm not your best friend,

449
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,690
what is this marriage about?!

450
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,349
Okay, okay, you're my best friend.

451
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,937
She's just somebody I call
when I'm mad at you.

452
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:47,859
-(screams)
-(grumbling)

453
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,361
I mean, I'm never mad at you.

454
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,033
Well, sometimes I'm mad at you.

455
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,031
A little bit! But I shouldn't call her.

456
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,703
-I should just drink it off at Moe's.
-(growling)

457
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,333
You'll never hear the name Julia again.

458
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,950
-Hi, I'm Julia.
-(screams)

459
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,498
I just wanted to introduce myself

460
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,791
and tell you you've got a great husband.

461
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,585
I've got a nice bicycle, too,

462
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,548
but I keep a lock on it.

463
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:12,219
I have no interest in...
<i>riding</i> your bike.

464
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,929
But I want you to know
that your bike loves you

465
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,390
as truly as a bike can.

466
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,891
And, Marge, I love you
as much as that bike.

467
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,484
You <i>are</i> the bike.

468
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,809
(gasps) Wha...?!

469
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,650
(door creaks)

470
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,731
I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

471
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,187
Apparently, you didn't do anything wrong.

472
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,737
But I'm not wrong
for getting mad at you either.

473
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:38,082
Marge, Julia taught me lots
of stuff that could help us.

474
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,238
For example,
I realize that when you see me

475
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,827
doing something stupid and you don't

476
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,372
say anything about it, you <i>do</i> know,

477
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,076
and you're just being nice.

478
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,326
That's true.

479
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,917
And when something's bothering you,

480
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:54,263
sometimes I should just say,
"I understand,"

481
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,721
instead of trying to fix it.

482
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,221
Because all you really need is

483
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,562
someone to know what you're feeling.

484
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,179
That is really, really lovely.

485
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,347
(both moaning)

486
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,110
I have to confess,
I did see him naked on the roof.

487
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,399
I did, too, and I was at 10,000 feet.

488
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,654
Now for the final fantasy.

489
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,607
(crying)

490
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,868
(gasps) Oh, my love, my love,

491
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:24,711
losing you so young, so beautiful.

492
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,578
Still no jokes.

493
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:32,672
(flatly) I love you, and how.

494
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:36,134
(sobs) You're too good for heaven, man.

495
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,546
(chuckles) Excellent.

496
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,348
(creatures squawking)

497
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,932
(eerie shriek)

498
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,636
Welcome, Monty.

499
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,438
I'd like to take a selfie with you.

500
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,072
All right, but just one.

501
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,781
Hmm, it's not plugged in.
