00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,555
I'm gonna be late for work.

177
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,061
Mmm, no, you won't.

178
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,063
Follow me.

179
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,444
(laughs)

180
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,360
(siren wailing)

181
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,399
Wow. So this is what it feels
like to be a pregnant lady.

182
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,901
Hey, Simpson,

183
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,817
think you got all the
best Battle Ball cards?

184
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,617
Well, stink again,
smell-wad.

185
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,500
Ralph Wiggum's got a
platinum lava genie.

186
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,253
How'd a pull-up like you
get a great card like that?

187
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,093
My not-dead grandma
sent it from Tokyo.

188
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,089
Ralph, I will play you
for that card.

189
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:29,011
Okay, but if I win,
you have to teach me
how to play this game.

190
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,091
Deal.

191
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,545
Sir, I think
something's going down.

192
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,308
Something big.

193
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,229
Hmm. Could that be some sort
of narcotics transaction?

194
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,689
Uh, what are you asking
<i>me </i>for?

195
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,896
(gasps)

196
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,359
Ooh.

197
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,109
I see you're impressed
by my costume

198
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,611
for the school's annual
drug-awareness assembly.

199
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,573
Uh, so am I getting
a raise or not?

200
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,485
No.

201
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,202
Hey, Homer, hand
me my coffee.

202
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,544
Want some sugar?

203
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,749
No, no, I got it.

204
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,093
Impressive.

205
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,259
Hey, would it be okay if I,
uh, ran a make on myself?

206
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,341
Go ahead.

207
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,137
Drunk
<i>and </i>disorderly?

208
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,182
<i>That's </i>a little redundant.

209
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,386
Hey, uh, mind if I do
a little spring cleaning?

210
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,057
I'll tell you what, I'll
just look the other way

211
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,896
while you press
"control-F3."

212
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,363
Oh. You just put yourself
on AMBER Alert.

213
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,283
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

214
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,203
-Um...
-WOMAN:
Hey! There he is!

215
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,367
{\an8}WIGGUM:
Okay, that's better.

216
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,461
Not a good time
to be carrying this cake.

217
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:45,294
Listen, Homer, uh,
would you like to see my, uh...

218
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,336
my favorite place
in the whole world?

219
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,380
Really? Me?

220
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,133
Homer, I'm gonna let you
in on a little secret.

221
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,046
Cops don't have
many friends.

222
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,675
Civilians are
scared of us,

223
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,221
and, uh, other cops

224
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,095
just remind us of things
we want to forget.

225
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,981
That's why our friendship
is... so special to me.

226
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,810
(sniffles):
Chief... me, too.

227
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:09,026
Um, you know I've been back here
for, like, ten hours.

228
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,438
Any chance
of a bathroom break?

229
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,396
Thanks a lot,
jailbird.

230
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,946
Now I've got you on burglary
<i>and </i>killing a moment.

231
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,526
Mrs. Simpson,
Bart has always been

232
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,408
what we educators term
a no-goodnik.

233
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,745
But lately his behavior
has taken a more sinister turn.

234
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:28,922
Yes. We have reason to believe
your son has been dealing drugs.

235
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,133
(gasps):
Dealing drugs?

236
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,263
That's impossible.

237
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,261
He... he doesn't have
the math skills.

238
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,184
Marge, I know you've
tried everything

239
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,472
to keep Bart
under control--

240
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,305
Ritalin, Lithium, Zoloft.

241
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,890
Well, they didn't work.

242
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,015
He has moved on to drugs.

243
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,852
(worried groan)

244
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,977
(door creaks)

245
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,225
Bart? Bart, are you here?

246
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,944
(rowdy laughter)

247
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,028
MILHOUSE:
You really know how
to roll 'em, Bart.

248
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,204
(gasps):
That's drug talk.

249
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,043
But I could be mistaken.

250
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:04,578
Let me just listen
to a little more out of context.

251
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,174
This product
is unbelievable.

252
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,918
It's imported,
you know.

253
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,420
(gasps)

254
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,212
(coughs)

255
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,259
You ever worry the sun's
not gonna come back

256
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,843
after it goes
down at night?

257
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,098
No.

258
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,599
Uh, me, neither.

259
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,181
But-but you
know who does?

260
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,475
Ralphie. Got a lot of
worries, that kid.

261
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,979
What if the
bed wets him?

262
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,021
What if Superman decided
to kill everybody?

263
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,476
(chuckles)

264
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,025
Hey, Ralph's a good kid.

265
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,279
And he should be.

266
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,320
He's got a great dad.

267
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:40,494
Ah, Homer Simpson, you always
know the perfect thing to say.

268
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,874
<i>LOU (over radio):</i>
<i>Chief. Chief, it's Lou.</i>

269
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,371
Ugh.

270
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,161
Okay, what is it now?

271
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,207
<i>They're shooting at us!</i>

272
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,459
<i>We need backup now!</i>

273
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,921
You need backup,
or you want backup?

274
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,671
<i>We got a 2-11 in progress!</i>

275
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,594
Hey, what have I told you
about not using the numbers?

276
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,054
<i>It's an armed robbery, damn it!</i>

277
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,804
(gunshots)

278
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,045
(sighing):
Oh, I guess we should go.

279
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,483
Ooh, ooh. Can
I cuff him?

280
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,310
(laughs)
Sure. Why not?

281
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,855
Chief, come on.
He's not trained.

282
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,818
Oh, who are you,
the rules police?

283
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,858
Uh, no.
We are the police police.

284
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,992
Nobody moves, or the
doughboy gets popped.

285
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,280
(yelling)

286
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,913
Take your hands off my brother

287
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,160
from another mother.

288
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,537
(gunshot, groans)

289
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,908
Let's get
out of here!

290
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,325
Not to worry, Homer.

291
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,373
That's what bulletproof
vests are for.

292
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,037
(sighs)

293
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,335
Uh-oh.

294
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,879
(agonized groan)

295
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,349
Is he gonna
be okay?

296
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,894
It's going to be touch and go.

297
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,307
His left lung was filled
with shamrock shake.

298
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,896
McDonald's didn't even
sell them this year.

299
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,112
(crying)

300
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,954
Don't worry, Sarah.

301
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,489
Clancy was
there for me,

302
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,072
and I'll be
there for him.

303
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:11,168
♪♪

304
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:23,891
(laughing)

305
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,808
Huh? Oops.

306
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,939
Don't die on me, Clancy.

307
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,271
(crying)

308
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,316
You said our friendship
was special.

309
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,200
Well, if it was
so special,

310
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,948
wake up,
you fat sack of...

311
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,412
(moaning)

312
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,873
Homer?

313
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,873
Huh? What-what happened to me?

314
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,495
You saved my life.

315
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,541
And I came here every day
to make sure you pulled through.

316
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,996
Thanks, Homer.

317
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,916
You're a true friend.

318
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,134
Unlike that Lou.

319
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,094
You're too late.

320
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,134
Chief, I've been sleeping
on that couch for a week.

321
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,638
You missed the wake-up.

322
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,009
That's all that counts.

323
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,096
(sighs)

324
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,229
Clancy, I haven't seen
my family in days.

325
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,188
Would you mind
if I went home now?

326
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,979
Now? But I-I just woke up.

327
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,823
Well, if you really want me
to stay...

328
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,939
No, no.
You do what you have to do.

329
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,816
Live your life... which I saved.

330
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,913
Fine. I'll stay
a little more.

331
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,489
Great. Great.

332
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,334
And can you read me a story...
that you write yourself?

333
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,080
It should be about
an imaginary meeting

334
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,161
between Babe Ruth
and Hitler.

335
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,747
But make no mention of
baseball or Germany.

336
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,833
And... begin.

337
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,750
(groans)

338
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,604
Oh.

339
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,272
Ah. Ooh.

340
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,386
(groans)

341
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,105
(gasps)

342
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,439
(groaning)

343
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,319
Hmm?

344
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,867
Oh. Hmm.

345
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:12,907
Awesome.

346
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,745
You finally made
my room cool.

347
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,210
Bart Simpson,
are you a drug-o?

348
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,842
What? No.

349
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,959
Not until you
raise my allowance.

350
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,706
Well, can you explain
what you were doing

351
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,467
in the basement with Milhouse?

352
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,049
Getting higher and higher...
