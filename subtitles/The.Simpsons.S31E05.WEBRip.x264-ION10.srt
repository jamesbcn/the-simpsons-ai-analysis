1
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,711
Make way!

2
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:16,049
Get ready for fun, kids.

3
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,619
Fun that begins with sunblock.

4
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,324
Come on, Maggie.

5
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,194
You don't want to grow up
to look like Grampa.

6
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:34,101
I can't enjoy seeing
animals treated like this.

7
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:35,903
It must be horrible
spending every day

8
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,571
trapped behind a pane of glass.

9
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,306
It ain't great.

10
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,808
Sweetie, if they're so unhappy,

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,610
why are they wagging
their tails?

12
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:47,180
- That's how fish swim.
- Well, I say they're happy.

13
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:50,851
Penguin funerals
at 12:00, 2:00 and 4:00.

14
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:00,794
The killer whale is called
an apex predator

15
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:03,130
because there's nothing
that can eat it.

16
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,632
Nothing that can eat it, eh?

17
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:20,047
No. No.

18
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,988
This just got weird.

19
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:31,224
And now for our biggest star,
it's lunchtime.

20
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,260
I need a small child out here.

21
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,196
You get on out there,
hors d'oeuvre.

22
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:44,137
No worries, folks.
I lost my arm years ago.

23
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:47,207
Can we please go home?

24
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,911
This fun place
is about to make me cry.

25
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:53,146
Homer, why don't you take Maggie
for a stroll

26
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,249
and we'll check out
that mermaid over there.

27
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,586
Oh, that tail is so fake.

28
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,194
Smithers,
can we splash the people

29
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,063
- dining at that fine restaurant?
- As you wish, sir.

30
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,335
I love Sunday fun.

31
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,239
You know, sweetie,
I always wanted a boat,

32
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:22,309
but my dad could
never afford one.

33
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:25,212
<i>Sitting on the dock
of the bay</i>

34
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:29,449
<i>Missing all my school today</i>

35
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:33,120
<i>Getting dumb...</i>

36
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,759
Knock off that whistling.

37
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,529
Men have good times in silence.

38
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:45,132
Daddy, will we ever get a boat?

39
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,933
Are you kidding?

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,269
We couldn't even afford worms.

41
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:53,073
Aw, don't cry.

42
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,075
Have some Scottish
feel-good juice.

43
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:57,077
Okay.

44
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,946
Come on. Drink up.

45
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,951
By the standards of the day,
I'm a great father.

46
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,589
Nice boat, huh? I sell boats.

47
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,191
Wish you could have one?

48
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:12,559
Yeah, but I'll never own a boat.

49
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,529
It's just a dream,
like doing a sit-up.

50
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,531
Don't be so sure.

51
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,533
I don't know what you do
for a living, but me?

52
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,568
I'm in the dream business.

53
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,204
I thought you sold boats.
Make up your mind, liar.

54
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:27,140
Now I could get
in big trouble for doing this,

55
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,409
but if you buy this boat now
for the listed price,

56
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,712
I'll throw in
this genuine captain's hat.

57
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,146
Don't tell my manager.

58
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,981
What do you think I am,
an idiot?

59
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,017
This hat isn't even adjustable.

60
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:39,086
- It's one-size-fits-all.
- Deal.

61
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,855
Wha... No, wait,
my wife will kill me.

62
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,356
You think your wife's
gonna kill you

63
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,859
when she's sipping margaritas
as the sun sets,

64
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:48,662
her hair blowing softly
in the ocean breeze?

65
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,198
Her hair doesn't blow.
It kind of clangs.

66
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,333
Look, ask any financial planner
and they'll tell you

67
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,135
that getting a boat
is a better investment

68
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:58,038
than getting a divorce
or opening a bookstore.

69
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,806
One more thing
and I'm convinced.

70
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:02,542
I'll give you this little pin
from a defunct yacht club.

71
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,044
Sold.

72
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:06,313
Hey, what's this little
hook thing on it?

73
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,516
That's an anchor. You're gonna
be a fine yachtsman.

74
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:16,656
Oh, my God,
your dorsal fin has collapsed.

75
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:20,026
Don't you see? She doesn't have
enough space to swim.

76
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,095
That thing is huge.

77
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:27,134
This park is cruel and inhumane.

78
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,669
Empty the tanks. Pull the plug!

79
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,172
I'll be back.
You can't silence me.

80
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:36,276
I... So cute.

81
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:40,647
Thrown out
of another amusement park.

82
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:43,550
- Take me with you.
- Not enough seat belts.

83
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,087
<i>What do you do
with a drunken salesman?</i>

84
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,889
<i>He goes home to his wife</i>

85
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,024
Finally moved
that old cabin cruiser.

86
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,026
No one spots a sucker like you.

87
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:56,096
Let me guess, overweight guy,
midlife crisis?

88
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,330
The kind of fat
where you don't even know

89
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,732
how old they are.

90
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,767
- How was your day?
- Beautiful.

91
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:03,703
Sold a Jacuzzi to someone
who came in to use the phone.

92
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,205
Did you gouge him
on the dipping attachment?

93
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:07,174
Wholesale plus three grand.

94
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,342
You get over here.

95
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,179
Make me an offer.

96
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,182
Smooth.

97
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,551
Bart, I need your help...

98
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,053
Go away.

99
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,522
- With a prank...
- Oh, what do you need?

100
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,759
Hot sauce? Cow heart? Fire ants?

101
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,327
They're gone.

102
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:30,030
How could fire ants
get out of a paper bag?

103
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:33,366
Thank you, Lord, for these
fire ants entering my nose,

104
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:36,169
biting my brain,
testing my faith.

105
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,938
But I will...

106
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,506
Damn it, where's the spray?

107
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:44,544
Thanks for helping us
free that whale, Willie.

108
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:48,415
Aye. Now, to put on
me camouflage.

109
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,286
Man, you really know this place.

110
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,155
I work here in the summer.

111
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,924
Unlike you children,
the fish don't make fun of me.

112
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,162
Just 'cause you're cuter than me

113
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,197
don't mean you're better
than me.

114
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:05,999
You're not even a fish!

115
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:12,105
Unless I miss me guess, these
are the orca tank controls.

116
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,940
This guy's good.

117
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:17,944
We'll open the seawater gate and
she'll go straight in the ocean.

118
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,617
I believe it's lefty loosey.

119
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:28,455
Everything in this country
is backwards and wrong.

120
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:47,040
Thank God. A way off the ship.

121
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,646
We did it.
We set a captive animal free.

122
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,882
Pretty cool, huh, Bart?

123
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,684
Look how happy that thing is.

124
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,686
Lis, this is a new feeling.

125
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:03,423
We helped a whale be free
and now I feel wonderful.

126
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,226
What you're searching for
is altruism.

127
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,830
And that's called karma.

128
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,632
Are you happy, Willie?

129
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:15,435
I'll show you. Air bagpipes.

130
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,983
Okay, I'm gonna take
the blindfold off.

131
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,618
Don't ask questions.
Don't probe for answers.

132
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,820
I'll just pretend
I don't know we're on a dock

133
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,188
next to the water.

134
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,725
Look where we are.
A dock next to the water.

135
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,528
You got a boat for the day.

136
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,997
Did you bring beer
and sandwiches?

137
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:47,067
Why don't you open that?

138
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,403
Hey, Midge, got your beer
and sandwiches right here.

139
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:57,043
Come on, Maggie, get on Daddy's
wap and take the wheel.

140
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,145
That's right, maximum thwottle.

141
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,183
Vroom, vroom.
Maximum thwottle.

142
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,553
Ooh, you're hydwopwaning.
Yes, you are.

143
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:18,565
88 years old
and never learned to swim.

144
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,371
What a wonderful day, Homie.

145
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:27,374
It's like we're living
in the painting over our couch.

146
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,376
Our marriage
has never been better.

147
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,077
Time to risk it all.

148
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,947
Okay, guess whose boat this is.

149
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,749
I hope it's not Johnny Depp's.

150
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,351
He's already in
so much financial trouble.

151
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:41,721
Brace yourself, baby.
It's ours.

152
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,090
You bought this boat?

153
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,092
No. We bought this boat.

154
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,261
You just weren't aware.

155
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,099
- You know what? It's okay.
- Are you nuts?

156
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,369
You went out and got something
the whole family could enjoy.

157
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,371
- Let's live a little.
- Oh, my God, Marge.

158
00:08:58,438 --> 00:08:59,973
What's happened to you?

159
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,975
I admit it.
You've worn me down.

160
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,811
You're my little polished gem.

161
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,584
What do you think, Dad?

162
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:15,255
Oh, you did it, son.
You actually did it.

163
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:18,958
You found a parking spot
at the marina.

164
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:23,029
- Oh, I never...
- No, Dad. I got a boat.

165
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:26,399
- Get on.
- Oh, sure. I... Wait a minute.

166
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,202
You're gonna kill me
and dump me overboard.

167
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,137
Well, fine. Here's my will.

168
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,972
Oh, come on now,

169
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,407
I'm not gonna kill you.

170
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:35,975
That's 'cause you're a lazy bum.

171
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,211
Now, come on, give me a hug.

172
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,787
- Nice boat.
- I'm the owner.

173
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:51,024
Very nice. I must tell you,
she's running a little rough.

174
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,193
Aren't we all?

175
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,461
Good one.

176
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,995
Listen, I'm a mechanic,

177
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,264
and I think you're going
to need my help.

178
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,034
Your boat is used,
and it needs repairs now.

179
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,302
Why now?

180
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,838
It's sinking.

181
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,874
So, Milhouse, it turns out
I'm addicted to altruism.

182
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,276
I'm not gonna be happy
till I set another animal free.

183
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:14,147
If I wanted to hang out with
Lisa, I'd hang out with Lisa.

184
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,915
No, you wouldn't.

185
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,650
Now I can't free another fish

186
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,719
because they've increased
security at the water park.

187
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,055
This is great.
I got a flashlight,

188
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,858
walkie-talkie,
big old ring of keys.

189
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,927
But I found something else
we can set free.

190
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,230
Meet LoLo the gorilla.

191
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,265
Powerful, intelligent.

192
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,234
She can sign five words.

193
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,736
Friend, enemy, kill,

194
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,339
vodka and Seinfeld.

195
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,107
You know she wants out.

196
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,710
Now for security,
I'll say the rest in Pig Latin.

197
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,945
Ee-way, ill-way, oh-gay, oh-tay,
ee-thay, oo-zay.

198
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,380
We're going on eBay?

199
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,250
Ay-yay arumba-cay.

200
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,320
- Yello.
- Are you sitting down?

201
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,622
Of course.

202
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,724
Fixed your boat.
Here's the total.

203
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,726
Don't say I didn't warn you.

204
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,897
There is one hope,
share your expenses.

205
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,899
Pull your friends
into the black hole with you.

206
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,868
Yes, sir. You're supposed to
disappear now.

207
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:11,204
Yeah, I will,
but that's another hundred.

208
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,778
- Hey, Homer.
- What's the problem?

209
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:23,716
I feel terrible,
just terrible.

210
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,218
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

211
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,486
Because I have been withholding

212
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:29,923
an incredible opportunity
from you guys.

213
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,058
My apologies. Got to go.

214
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,394
Did I hear, wait, wait?

215
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,762
- No.
- We're good.

216
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:40,099
Okay, 'cause it's
really, really incredible.

217
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,469
See you. Leaving now.
On my way.

218
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,939
Last chance. Buh-bye.

219
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,282
Yello.

220
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,518
Okay, I'll bite.
What's the opportunity?

221
00:11:58,585 --> 00:11:59,786
I don't know, Lenny.

222
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,655
I mean, I need someone
with genuine enthusiasm.

223
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,091
- Understood. Have a good ni...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

224
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,626
Do you want to go in
on a boat with me?

225
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,061
We share expenses,
we split the time.

226
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,896
If you agree,
continue breathing normally.

227
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,231
I don't know.

228
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,166
I heard that sharing boats
can ruin friendships.

229
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,135
Well, somebody better tell
Carl 'cause he is in.

230
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,071
Wait, I don't want
to be left out. I'm in!

231
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,773
Glad to hear it.
Could you put Carl on?

232
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:27,046
We brought
our old college stereo.

233
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,381
Let's let everyone
in the water know

234
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:31,184
some big shots
are having a wild time.

235
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,387
<i>I love to work
at nothing all day</i>

236
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:37,190
<i>And I'll be taking care
of business</i>

237
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,125
<i>Every day</i>

238
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,493
<i>Taking care of business</i>

239
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,228
<i>Every way...</i>

240
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:46,065
Yeah, those fish are hearing
some awesome B.T.O. right now.

241
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:49,068
Why don't you take
the throttle, dear.

242
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,406
Oh, I feel it!
I feel the power.

243
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:56,009
You know, I thought we were
just dating casually.

244
00:12:56,075 --> 00:13:00,146
It wasn't going anywhere.
But now, will you marry me?

245
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:03,549
I...
This is not a no!

246
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,020
<i>Taking care of business</i>

247
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,121
<i>Every day</i>

248
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,126
Okay, I've got it.

249
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:16,729
What she doesn't know is there's
an overgrown vine behind her

250
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,998
where she can climb up
to freedom.

251
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:22,635
One of us has to get in there
and show her how to do it,

252
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:25,171
but which one?

253
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:28,074
Did I ever mention that
I'm allergic to gorilla fur?

254
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,944
Dang! The one thing
I'm not allergic to.

255
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:35,214
You know, this time I really
thought Bart was gonna do it.

256
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,951
- I'll do it next time.
- I know you will, buddy.

257
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,047
We got a problem.

258
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,183
Two problems.

259
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,820
So this is what it's like
to be in a loving family.

260
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,135
Hello?

261
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,903
Lis, altruism sucks.

262
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,572
You idiot.

263
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,808
You set a fish free because
it has an ocean to swim in.

264
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,310
If you set a gorilla free,

265
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:41,514
it goes into the city
and it gets killed.

266
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,116
The Great Esc-Ape?

267
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,585
A gorilla mysteriously freed
from the Springfield Zoo

268
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,987
is wreaking havoc
all over town.

269
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,189
The police, as always,
are useless.

270
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,992
Not true, Kent.
We've located the gorilla.

271
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,628
He's on the top of a store
next to a sign reading,

272
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:58,030
You'll Go Ape
For Our Bargains.

273
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,133
Yeah, I think that's
a balloon, Chief.

274
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,634
Prove it.

275
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,236
Happy, Lou?

276
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,937
You just shot a balloon.

277
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,106
I love boat ownership.

278
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:10,176
Spending every weekend
polishing brass.

279
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,844
I feel like Larry Ellison.

280
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,447
I had the espresso maker
mounted on gimbals,

281
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:17,083
so when the big waves hit,
they won't ruin the foam art

282
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,751
on our cappuccino.

283
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:24,023
Foam Lenny, you're my hero.

284
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,626
Hey, who are all these people?

285
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:29,495
I may have sold
some extra shares,

286
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,998
so I'm afraid
these are all co-owners.

287
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:35,435
Co-owner I be, says me. Yarr.

288
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,604
Duffman wants to impress
his new stepkids.

289
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,106
What do you think, Kyle?

290
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:43,142
My father died
from drinking your product.

291
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,045
We have a lot to work on.
Oh, yeah!

292
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:49,582
All these people are co-owners?
Even Cat Lady?

293
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,084
Now she's Catamaran Lady.

294
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,422
There's too many people,
I can't move.

295
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,090
Okay, cast off.

296
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,632
Hey, my cappuccino head.

297
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,102
Well, at least I can swim
to shore.

298
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,539
This is,
this is too hard.

299
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,008
Hey! Hey, I can stand!

300
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,977
No, it's just too hard.

301
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,219
Perhaps music
will calm her down.

302
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,155
<i>One, eight, seven, seven,
cars for kids</i>

303
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,760
My screenplay!

304
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,729
LoLo. LoLo!

305
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,264
Friend. Friend.

306
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,902
Oh, no, I accidentally
signed fiend.

307
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:47,073
Look, I'll help you
find safety.

308
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,610
I just have to convince you
I'm your friend. How?

309
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,144
How?

310
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,218
Seinfeld.

311
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:02,288
Newman.

312
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,159
If this was just
a little bit looser,

313
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:11,063
it would be the best thing
in the world.

314
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,835
Sir, I would like
to return my boat

315
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:18,004
for a full refund.

316
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,006
Oh, I'm sorry.
Perhaps James Cameron

317
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,874
would take an interest
in your sunken ship,

318
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:24,877
but my responsibility
ended at ka-ching.

319
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:26,812
You sold me a lemon.

320
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,248
People like lemons.
They're good for your voice.

321
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:32,752
With your smooth talk, you could
convince anyone of anything.

322
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,454
You like my lapels?
You want to buy the jacket?

323
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,591
- Yes.
- 50 bucks.

324
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,893
Now if you'll excuse me,

325
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,128
I'm also in another business.

326
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,963
Smuggling meth
inside bicycle tires.

327
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,932
Thanks for the free bike.

328
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,967
Just get it to Mexico
by tomorrow.

329
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,635
Ba-ja!

330
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,938
Lisa, what are you doing?

331
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,473
I'm in my bedroom with Dad.

332
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,376
Oh, that's sweet.

333
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,211
Watch it!

334
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:02,715
Homie, I told you
to stop doing that.

335
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,285
Y'all bring your gorilla here.

336
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:08,087
We'll teach him
to ride and shoot,

337
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,089
and soon it'll be
a Planet of the Apes.

338
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,090
Whoops.

339
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:12,825
No.

340
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:14,994
Here at U.T.A.,
United Talented Apes,

341
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,596
we'll shave your gorilla

342
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,065
and make him a body double
for Bruce Willis,

343
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,900
and if he behaves
even a little,

344
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:23,102
he could become Bruce Willis.

345
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,972
Next.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

346
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,141
You're perfect.
Will you take my ape?

347
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:34,447
Dr. Goodall, I can't thank you
enough for saving LoLo.

348
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,283
LoLo. That's what they
called her in captivity,

349
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,151
but I've given her a new name,

350
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:43,322
one worthy of such
a magnificent creature, PoPo.

351
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:46,692
And may I just tell you,
you've always been my hero.

352
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,628
Thank you. But I wonder,

353
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:52,398
how many female scientists
have you told they're your hero?

354
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,301
In your field? Only three.

355
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:59,205
Oh, well. Good enough.
We'll take fine care of PoPo.

356
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,374
- See you soon.
- Wait. Come back.

357
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,343
Take me with you. I want a life
exactly like yours.

358
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,214
Well, so do hundreds of others,
but still, you might get lucky

359
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,517
if you work really hard
and get a doctorate.

360
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,052
Would you give me a scholarship?

361
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,955
No, you'd have to save up,
like I did.

362
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,957
Then there's a slight chance
you'll have me?

363
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:21,160
Well, very slight,
but don't give up.

364
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:24,163
That is the most encouraging
thing I have ever heard.

365
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,666
Lis, thanks for undoing
the damage of my good deed.

366
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,734
I'm glad you've
come to understand

367
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,870
the importance of altruism.

368
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,538
Altruism rocks!

369
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:35,374
Like when you let something go
and it smashes everything.

370
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,343
Next, I want to
altruism a rhino.

371
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,746
Then I'm gonna altruism a robot
with sledgehammers for hands.

372
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,615
Sometimes I just want
to sit back

373
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:46,552
and watch the whole world
altruism.

374
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,388
Look, the gorillas
have picked up some new habits

375
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:50,856
from your father.

376
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,063
Yeah, but Homer picked up
some cool gorilla moves too.

377
00:20:06,002 --> 00:20:08,008
Well, I never.

378
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,110
Okay, okay, I know you're mad,

379
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:13,245
but because there are
so many of us,

380
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,147
we each just lost a little.

381
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,950
And I just want to say,
for the rest of your life,

382
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:21,153
you'll know that you're just as
good as someone who owns a boat

383
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,323
because you owned a boat
for five minutes.

384
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,960
Well, you did give us something
for our money, great memories.

385
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,830
And look what someone in Japan
sent back to me.

386
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,765
Three cheers for Homer.

387
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,801
Hip, hip, hooray!
Hip, hip, hooray!

388
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,103
Hip, hip, hooray!

389
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,371
Foam Lenny on Fox!

390
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:43,075
Fridays at 8:00,
because we've got nothing else.
