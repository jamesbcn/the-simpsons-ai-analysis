1
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:22,389
Shut up!
It's starting!

2
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:23,957
The Springfield Atoms
have earned

3
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,101
the number-one pick
in this year's draft,

4
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:29,229
after intentionally losing
every game last season.

5
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,099
Nobody tanks like Springfield...

6
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,268
City of Intentional Losers.

7
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,203
Tank! Tank! Tank!

8
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:37,938
And with the first pick

9
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:41,041
of the draft,
the Springfield Atoms select...

10
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,876
Grayson Mathers.

11
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:45,946
All right!

12
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:48,682
Yeah! All right!

13
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:53,854
We have witnessed the most
beautiful birth in the world...

14
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:56,290
That of a football dynasty.

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,427
Let's show Philadelphia what
a real victory riot looks like!

16
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,506
What a needless tragedy.

17
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,975
You say our corporate revenue
is down?

18
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:17,644
Well, the losses are
all coming from one division...

19
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,946
Your liquor company.

20
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,480
Sales of Mr. Gentleman Brandy

21
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,283
have reached zero and
are only projected to go down.

22
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,251
Impossible.

23
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:26,153
Mr. Gentleman is sipped
by every trustee

24
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,355
of the Narragansett
Whale Oil Concern.

25
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,891
Well, maybe the problem
is the ad campaign.

26
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,359
It's encouraging consuming

27
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,528
as little of the liquor
as possible.

28
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,799
Ah. That'll hold me
for quite a while.

29
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,234
So, I brought
in a branding expert

30
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,469
to reimagine Mr. Gentleman.

31
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,637
These days,

32
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,873
which in the branding business
is called "the present,"

33
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:48,008
the only liquor brands
people care about

34
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,110
are endorsed by big celebrities.

35
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,145
People think,
"If I buy this tequila,

36
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,348
then I'm as fun
as George Clooney."

37
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,884
Or, "I need to be more smug
and unbearable.

38
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,286
Hey,
Ryan Reynolds has a gin."

39
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:02,723
So we find the perfect celebrity
to represent my brandy.

40
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:03,991
But who?

41
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:05,726
What about Harrison Ford?

42
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,728
- Too Hollywood.
- Dolly Parton?

43
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:08,828
Too Dollywood.

44
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:09,763
With that, we end the list

45
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,099
of every celebrity
who does not already have

46
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,567
an existing liquor company.

47
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,870
So what we need
is a brand-new celebrity,

48
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,972
one adored by the common man.

49
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,974
Grayson Mathers!

50
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:24,411
Grayson Mathers!
Grayson Mathers!

51
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:25,913
Grayson!

52
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,213
Grayson, some have dubbed you.

53
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,383
"The Savior of Springfield
Football".

54
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,785
Isn't that a lot of pressure
for a rookie?

55
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,053
I do me.

56
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,622
If you don't like it,
that's on you.

57
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,292
Grayson, some people are put off

58
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,793
by your tell-it-like-it-is
attitude.

59
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,961
What do you say to them?

60
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:42,129
I'm an open book,

61
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,931
but the media and haters

62
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,933
and people who have
never played the game,

63
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,836
I carry myself
with a certain confidence,

64
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,271
and I don't apologize
for your perception

65
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,474
of statements I did not make,
but stand by.

66
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,476
Truth bomb.

67
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,178
I sleep at night.

68
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,813
What did you just say?

69
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,582
I do me.

70
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:05,552
Man, that dude
keeps it so real.

71
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:06,920
He's all, "This is me.

72
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,989
I don't apologize.
What up, haters?"

73
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,124
He does him.

74
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:13,994
I wish I was
half as myself as he is.

75
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:17,865
They adore this pigskin-tossing
football thrower.

76
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,600
He's brash, outspoken,

77
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,502
willfully uninformed.

78
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:22,970
He has no filter.

79
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,772
In our sanitized,
clickbait-ready,

80
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:26,907
media-driven world,

81
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:29,376
what people crave
is authenticity.

82
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,112
If you don't believe me,
look at the metrics.

83
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,080
Now you believe me.

84
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,682
Why didn't you mention
any of this before?

85
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,652
I don't know.

86
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:42,122
This bad boy must be the new
face of my brandy company.

87
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,924
Smithers, hire him at once.

88
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:46,360
And get rid of this.

89
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,830
But my metrics!

90
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:58,338
I got no problem being me.

91
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,840
Opinions exist.

92
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,241
Think about it.

93
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:04,111
Do you seriously doubt
I know what I'm like?

94
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:05,946
And when it comes to brandy,

95
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,581
go ahead and sip.

96
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:08,582
Me?

97
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,317
I'll chug.

98
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,753
I do me.

99
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,454
You do you...

100
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,190
my way.

101
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,725
Congratulations, my boy.

102
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:22,396
You are the face of America's
most marked-up trash liquor.

103
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,665
There's one thing
that's unique about me...

104
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,900
I've always admired rich people.

105
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,736
And now I'm getting paid by one.

106
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:30,971
That's on you.

107
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,273
Aw, come on, Burnsy.

108
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,975
Bring it in.

109
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,377
Yeah. I got you, bro.

110
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,450
So this is what it feels like
to be brought in.

111
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:49,389
Cheers!

112
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,159
To the money
that comes from business.

113
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,028
To friendship hugs.

114
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,897
Well,

115
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,174
first game
of the season tomorrow,

116
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,333
so I'd better hit the Hay.

117
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,034
That's the name of the club
I'm going to.

118
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,254
Then I'm gonna hit the Sack.

119
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,438
That's where the after-party is.

120
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,044
There he is, kids.

121
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,480
The QB who will one day
take us to the Super Bowl,

122
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,582
own several
local car dealerships

123
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,785
and host a middling
Saturday Night Live.

124
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,488
Oh, look at that baby face.

125
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,258
I hope
there's no tackling today.

126
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,295
Babyface looks
a little hungover, Mom.

127
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,163
Geez. He's kind of got

128
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:33,800
that "Dad asleep in his car
outside Moe's" look going.

129
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,669
The icy stare of a born winner?

130
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,971
Yes. That one.

131
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:42,142
And so begins a new era
in Atoms football.

132
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,144
The golden child's mighty arm

133
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:47,748
shall spiral a grim warning
to all who would oppose him.

134
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,816
Hut, hut! Hike!

135
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,623
Oh, God.

136
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:00,427
- Get off the field! -Boo!
- You suck!

137
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:02,996
Oh, my God.

138
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,633
The 22-year-old
I bet all my happiness on

139
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,069
is nothing but a bust!

140
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:11,171
Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust!

141
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,273
But you were just
cheering for him.

142
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,975
You've been talking
about how great he is

143
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,476
every day for months.

144
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,145
But he's sucking.

145
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,692
It's the second-best thing
he could do

146
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,448
next to playing great.

147
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,852
How dare they jeer that boy?

148
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:27,020
He's like the arrogant,
out-of-control son

149
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,590
I never sent to boarding school
and forgot about.

150
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,960
And Grayson Mathers
has just been benched.

151
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:36,430
And here comes the Haterade.

152
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,768
Boo an angel, why don't you?

153
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,538
Thunder-stick him!

154
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:56,250
There are far worse things
to be buried under.

155
00:06:56,316 --> 00:07:00,153
Launch the souvenir
loaded nachos!

156
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:11,265
Ah. Nothing like
a nice body-temperature bath.

157
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:13,033
I've never been booed before.

158
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,068
Not even when I trolled
the Florida State fans

159
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,737
by dancing on their coach.

160
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,673
Am I, like, a loser now?

161
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,542
If I am a loser,

162
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,544
then maybe I shouldn't be...

163
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:24,778
doing me.

164
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:25,779
Pish posh.

165
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,614
Doing you is what you do best.

166
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:28,849
And I'll prove it,

167
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,518
by putting you
in front of an adoring crowd.

168
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:34,888
Captain Underpants here!

169
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,089
Wimpy Kid!

170
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,791
I got Narnia!

171
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,826
Goosebumps here!

172
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:43,597
Our guest has achieved great
things in life by hard work

173
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,098
and being six-foot-four.

174
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,934
Please welcome Grayson Mathers.

175
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,773
Your principal
brought me here to tell you

176
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,575
that school is important.

177
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,210
But I got to keep it real.

178
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,379
This is the first time
I've ever been in a school,

179
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:02,783
and I own
three identical Ferraris!

180
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:04,618
That's wassup!

181
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,356
I have a question.

182
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:10,624
You suck!

183
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,961
You're garbage
outside the pocket!

184
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:16,196
Your average depth of target
is a joke.

185
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:17,731
Bust! Bust! Bust!

186
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,501
The children are destroying him
with their hot takes!

187
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,636
Bust! Bust! Bust!

188
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,004
Shut up, you stupid kids!

189
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:26,173
I'm a man! A football man!

190
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:28,008
All I throw is dimes!

191
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,243
Here's a dime for you!

192
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,144
A dime for you!

193
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,479
Nothin' but dimes!

194
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:33,647
Boom! Dime!

195
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:35,883
Boom! Dime!

196
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:40,754
The Madagascar
hissing cockroaches are loose!

197
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,662
All I drink is brandy!

198
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:52,332
My urethra is on fire!

199
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:57,437
I heard what you said
about your urethra.

200
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,173
Are you feeling okay?

201
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,874
I'm fine. Beat it, media.

202
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,209
You listen here, young man.

203
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,344
Just because you're embarrassed
by your own behavior

204
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,313
is no reason to lash out at me.

205
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:09,049
I'm the one person in town
who feels sorry for you,

206
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,817
and even I've about had it.

207
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,686
Now apologize.

208
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:13,820
I'm sorry.

209
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,689
Um... ma'am.

210
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,325
Good. Now, tell me what's wrong.

211
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,569
I mean, it doesn't make sense.

212
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,695
I can't stop partying.
I barely sleep.

213
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:23,773
I called Peyton Manning
a chicken-fried Frankenstein

214
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:24,797
on Twitter.

215
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,667
I-I'm doing me more than ever.

216
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,402
So why don't I play good?

217
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:29,502
Oh, sweetie.

218
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:32,606
It sounds like you just need
to slow down.

219
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,910
I actually have
six identical Ferraris.

220
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,646
I want to own
all the blue ones.

221
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:43,984
I know what's wrong with you.

222
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,986
Not enough Ferraris.

223
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:48,722
What this boy needs
is a home-cooked meal

224
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,724
and a good night's sleep.

225
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,025
At my house.

226
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,862
A partnership
betwixt a man and a woman

227
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:57,331
to provide for the care
of a young person.

228
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,499
You supply
the nurturing home life,

229
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,401
and I'll be
the emotionally-withholding

230
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,570
yet somehow worshipped
father figure.

231
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,639
It's a deal.

232
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,641
You're coming home with me.

233
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:08,775
I really want to,

234
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:09,986
but I'm kind of supposed
to get into it

235
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,513
with some hockey players
outside a strip club later.

236
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,449
I'll call them
and tell them you're sick.

237
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:20,020
Yo. Two parents and some kids?

238
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,322
This is a straight-up family.

239
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:23,524
For real.

240
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,492
I guess we are.

241
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:28,929
So, Grayson, you just graduated
from college, right?

242
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:30,664
What did you major in?

243
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,032
Oh, they never told me.

244
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,902
That means communications.

245
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:37,538
You see, I grew up
on the Florida-Texas border,

246
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,373
where football is king.

247
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,209
One day, I saw this other baby
crawling a post pattern,

248
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,877
and I hit him with my pacifier.

249
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,246
Perfect spiral. 20 yards.

250
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,549
My folks did what
any loving parents would do...

251
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,817
They packed me off
to football academy.

252
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,319
I'm real grateful.

253
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:54,655
If you keep a kid at home
till he's two,

254
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,490
it can screw up his development.

255
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,992
Growing up in an
all-football environment

256
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:02,329
helped me avoid the distractions
that come with being a kid...

257
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,965
Friends, laughing, that junk.

258
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:08,001
For college, Alabama Tech
was an easy choice.

259
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:09,970
Coach is an amazing recruiter.

260
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,905
You really feel his passion.

261
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:15,042
Wait, so you never
see your parents?

262
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:16,910
Oh, I see them all the time!

263
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:17,911
I see them at games,

264
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,446
in documentaries about me,

265
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,757
in the Campbell's Soup
commercial

266
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:22,950
my mom did without my knowledge.

267
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,451
Oh, Grayson,

268
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,453
growing up with nothing
but football

269
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,188
can't have been healthy.

270
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:30,424
No, no, I'm good.

271
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,226
Gimme that back!

272
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:33,961
Starters eat before scrubs!

273
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,829
Everybody knows that!

274
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:45,939
You know, I'm beginning to see
the appeal of football.

275
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,908
Hit him again!

276
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,610
Kids, behave!

277
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:54,681
In a family,
we do not steal food.

278
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:55,983
- But...
- No buts.

279
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,660
Just because there aren't
coaches and minders

280
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:01,188
watching your every move doesn't
mean you can act selfishly.

281
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:04,391
In a family, you don't do you.

282
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,492
You do...

283
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,559
others?

284
00:12:06,627 --> 00:12:07,995
And don't you forget it.

285
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:10,397
Now, boys, clear the table.

286
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,500
Bust. Bust. Bust.

287
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,503
You sure the rookie
doesn't mind sharing?

288
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,639
Maggie loves company.

289
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,340
Um, Mrs. Marge,

290
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,975
do-do you think
it'd be all right

291
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,644
if I stayed here for a while?

292
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,547
I've never been around
a real family before.

293
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:28,782
Of course you can.

294
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,284
You sure? I'm a lot of work.

295
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,719
I need 9,000 calories a day
or I'll die.

296
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:35,489
So does my husband, silly.

297
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:09,489
Wow!

298
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,892
I've never seen such
a tiny megachurch.

299
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:14,828
It's a normal-sized
regular church, Grayson.

300
00:13:15,596 --> 00:13:18,966
Hey, here's a little fuel
for your private jet, Reverend.

301
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:23,637
When did the faces
on the paper money get so big?

302
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,075
Wow.

303
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:29,877
My first birthday party.

304
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,945
I made you a card.

305
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:35,048
We're all playing catch.

306
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,617
You've all given me so much.

307
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:38,018
I have a family now.

308
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:40,454
A family that's shown me
I don't have to be selfish

309
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:41,521
to be a success.

310
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:42,356
Huddle up, team.

311
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,124
Feelings on three!
One, two, three!

312
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,192
Feelings!

313
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,060
Who wants presents?

314
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,562
- I do! I do!
- Ooh, ooh, I do!

315
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:49,796
- I do! I do!
- Merch!

316
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,798
Try this on, big fella.

317
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:55,502
Mr. Burns! Mr. Burns!

318
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:57,070
I'm so glad you came!

319
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:59,239
Now it's a party, huh, guys?

320
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:00,941
Oh, I would never miss
the birthday

321
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,943
of football's brashest bad boy.

322
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,244
Now let's head out.

323
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:07,181
You and I are having
a night on the town.

324
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:10,017
It's time to party
with Brandyman!

325
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,353
Or Do-You-Man? I'm...
Can we decide on a catchphrase?

326
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,455
Catchphrase TBD!

327
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:16,723
Are you nuts?

328
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,258
You do realize that Grayson has

329
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:21,228
a career-defining
football game tomorrow.

330
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:24,431
He's gonna go to bed early
after a nice hot bath.

331
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:27,801
You can try out
the Silly Soap I bought. Huh?

332
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,002
All right!

333
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:30,804
This man plays a game
for a living

334
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:33,173
and you infantilize him?

335
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:37,444
Fine, but your mollycoddling
will have dire consequences.

336
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:39,446
Mark my words.

337
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:43,250
Mathers with
his fourth touchdown of the day!

338
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:45,485
And in a never-before-seen move,

339
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,055
the opposing defense
is resigning en masse

340
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,724
to try their luck
in the Canadian Football League.

341
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,192
Good luck, fellas.

342
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:56,063
There he is! The man I never
thought was a bust for a second!

343
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:58,065
A 53-point win.

344
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,367
Bet you can't wait to say
something really arrogant.

345
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:02,369
Just lucky
to have great teammates,

346
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:03,704
what a game plan,

347
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,340
keep my head down and work.

348
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,611
But also the greats who paved
the way in this league.

349
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,881
Where's my bad boy?

350
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:16,149
Come on, son. Be a sore winner.

351
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:17,885
Make Daddy proud.

352
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:20,120
Maybe you could call
the other team soft?

353
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,556
I mean, it's just us reporters
here. No one will know.

354
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:25,025
No, sir. I'm just trying
to be the kind of guy

355
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,060
who makes a mother proud.

356
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,829
Are you saying...

357
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:30,430
you're a mama's boy?

358
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:33,400
I'm the biggest mama's boy
on the planet!

359
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:36,904
Mmm. Tastes good.

360
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:39,573
Marge Simpson,
what have you done?

361
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,148
You've ruined
our beautiful, arrogant boy!

362
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,884
Ruined? He's happy now.

363
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,719
What's wrong, guys?
Why are you fighting?

364
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,722
Oh, this woman's got you as
twisted as a Cossack's mustache.

365
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:59,293
What happened to the bad boy I
raised up from recent adulthood?

366
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,228
Don't listen to him, Grayson.

367
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:04,998
I'm so sorry
I ruined your spokesperson.

368
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,867
He's not just my spokesperson.

369
00:16:06,934 --> 00:16:08,268
He's my spokes-son.

370
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,370
And you stole him from me.

371
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,106
You're so merged
with your own selfishness,

372
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:16,577
you don't even identify it
as selfishness anymore.

373
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:17,744
You're a monster!

374
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:19,313
And you're winning!

375
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:22,950
You've got to choose, my boy.

376
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,618
Me or her.

377
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:27,821
Can't you see
you're tearing me apart?!

378
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:30,057
I need to grind tape
of blitz protections

379
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,693
against an eight-man box!

380
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:51,044
I haven't heard
from Grayson in days.

381
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:54,548
Neither has the NFL Network,
ESPN or Adam Schefter.

382
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,350
The football world
hangs in the balance,

383
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,185
waiting for
this rookie phenom quarterback

384
00:16:58,252 --> 00:17:00,487
to choose
between his surrogate parents.

385
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:04,558
My sources tell me that Mathers
hasn't gone back to Mr. Burns

386
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,194
and that Marge has just
this second finished folding

387
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:09,930
the sheets Grayson
may never sleep on again.

388
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:11,765
What sources?

389
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,804
What if I never see my special
big football boy again?

390
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,742
Mom, a fancy invitation
came for you.

391
00:17:21,842 --> 00:17:23,443
Grayson sent me a ticket

392
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,713
for the Sports Channel's
annual awards show.

393
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,849
You're going
to the Sportswardsies?

394
00:17:28,949 --> 00:17:31,051
That's the one night
when pro athletes

395
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:33,287
finally get to thank
their agents.

396
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,989
And Grayson picked me
as his plus-one,

397
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,624
not Mr. Burns.

398
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:38,892
You won!

399
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,894
Motherhood won!

400
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:42,930
Yippee!

401
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,333
All good, all good.

402
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,740
- You!
- You!

403
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:58,011
Wait, I'm supposed
to be sitting next to Grayson.

404
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:01,014
So am I.
I know what's happening here.

405
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,317
Obviously, our boy
sat us together thinking

406
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,853
we would reach
some sort of rapprochement.

407
00:18:05,953 --> 00:18:07,921
He Parent Trapped us!

408
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:09,122
Too bad for him...

409
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:11,358
We're never gonna
see eye to eye.

410
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:12,459
Amen, sister.

411
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:16,096
A toast
to never-ending animosity.

412
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:18,565
I'll drink to that.

413
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:20,400
Enemies forever.

414
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,872
The Sportswardsies are starting.

415
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:27,007
Kids, have you filled out
your betting sheets?

416
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:29,309
Look at these categories.

417
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:30,511
Worst Contract?

418
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:31,745
Best World Series?

419
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:33,747
The Donald Sterling
Appalling Owner.

420
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:35,916
Lifetime Achievement Award?

421
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:38,118
James Dolan,
James Dolan, James Dolan.

422
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:41,221
For me, it's all about
Best Stretcher Ride Thumbs-Up.

423
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,590
Most of all,
I'd like to thank Gordo,

424
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:46,193
who I pay six figures
to carry my trophies.

425
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,729
Gordo, this is for you, buddy.

426
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:52,299
When we come back,
the Sportswardsy

427
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:54,501
for Most Inspiring Athlete.

428
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:57,004
Oh, he's looking
at the wrong camera.

429
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,206
He's such a cutie.

430
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:02,609
How could two people like us,
with all our flaws,

431
00:19:02,743 --> 00:19:04,745
make this perfect creature?

432
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,547
I'm a terrible father.

433
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:09,816
I should have raised him
to be a man, not a brand.

434
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:12,953
Ah. Let's promise
we'll do better, Monty.

435
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,421
Together.

436
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:18,358
The winner
for Most Inspiring Athlete is...

437
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:19,793
Grayson Mathers.

438
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:24,965
You all know I've had
some personal struggles lately.

439
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:28,235
I was losing
the football game of emotions.

440
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:31,004
But there's one person
who got me through it.

441
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:32,506
He's talking about you.

442
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:33,841
You're the nurturer.

443
00:19:33,974 --> 00:19:35,976
But you're his inspiration.

444
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:37,744
It's got to be you.

445
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:40,981
And that person is...

446
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:44,685
my fiancée Kaitlyn!

447
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:47,321
The three days I've known her
have seemed like a lifetime.

448
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:50,023
An Instagram model,
a YouTube reactor

449
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:52,092
and the creator of Yoga Yogurt,

450
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:54,461
the faith-based yogurt
you eat while yoga-ing.

451
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:57,331
Kaitlyn is so much more
than a business manager to me.

452
00:19:57,431 --> 00:20:00,033
Though she's that, too!
As of this morning!

453
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,870
Hope you can handle
total financial control, baby!

454
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,171
Good news, babe!

455
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:05,772
You're fighting Floyd Mayweather

456
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,841
on a Valentine's Day
pay-per-view!

457
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:11,011
She's getting me out
of the brandy business,

458
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:13,080
into something
more wholesome, y'all:

459
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:16,416
Our new line
of all-ages hard seltzers.

460
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,252
@Katilicious _97,

461
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:20,020
I can't wait to marry you.

462
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,522
Tell me there's a prenup.

463
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:22,588
No prenup!

464
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:24,191
That's how I roll!

465
00:20:24,258 --> 00:20:26,326
Who wants some seltzers?

466
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:27,327
Dime for you!

467
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,997
And just like that,
we've been replaced.

468
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:32,833
One day, they're these sweet,
innocent creatures

469
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,935
who are totally reliant on you.

470
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:37,437
Then, suddenly,
it's two weeks later

471
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:39,606
and they're gone.

472
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:54,254
When we return, find out
who takes home the Sportswardsy

473
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:55,923
for Best
Press Conference Meltdown

474
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:57,157
and Most Valuable MVP.

475
00:20:57,224 --> 00:20:59,193
Plus, Cirque du Soleil
will reimagine

476
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,228
this year's Most Flagrant Fouls.

477
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:03,497
Later, it's
Least Racist Team Name

478
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:05,632
and Coldest Bud Light,

479
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:06,852
brought to you by Bud Light.

480
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,102
And don't miss Kenny Chesney
and his musical tribute

481
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:12,472
to the 100 all-time
worst-run vanity charities.

482
00:21:12,573 --> 00:21:15,108
Then, find out which
baseball player will take home.

483
00:21:15,175 --> 00:21:17,044
Highest Batting Average.

484
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:19,112
And five living legends
battle it out

485
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:21,415
for the Most Tone-Deaf
Hall of Fame Speech.

486
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:22,516
And lots more.

487
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:26,119
All that when
the Sportswardsies continue.
