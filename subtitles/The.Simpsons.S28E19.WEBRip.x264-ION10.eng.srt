00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,599
So start your future today.

176
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,971
Because at Burns University...

177
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:58,847
ALL: Your life gets the full Monty!

178
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,806
-(chuckles)
-What are you laughing at?

179
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,357
Does "the Full Monty" have some
sort of naughty double meaning?

180
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:08,282
♪ <i>I believe in miracles</i> ♪

181
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,952
♪ <i>Where you from, you sexy thing...</i> ♪

182
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,622
If only our faculty
could be hired so easily.

183
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,041
Oh, but we already have a faculty-- them!

184
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,210
Sir, these people
can barely run the plant,

185
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,789
much less teach on the side.

186
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,004
Smithers, when you think of teachers,
what do you think of?

187
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,844
Low-paid workforce with no health care
in a toxic environment.

188
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,551
And there you have them.

189
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,471
Just pull them off one-by-one
till the power stops.

190
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,800
We'll be fine.

191
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,005
(Marge hums)

192
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,465
What are you teaching, Dad?

193
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,345
I'm giving lectures on what I do at work.

194
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,182
Well, what do you do at work?

195
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,557
Well, I... you know, the button stuff.

196
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,015
-Have you prepared a reading list?
-I have to read?

197
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,316
-No, it's for them.
-Whoo-hoo!

198
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,610
(groans)

199
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,863
But what are you actually
gonna say to them?

200
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,366
I'll start with the life cycle
of the atom.

201
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,988
A baby atom is called a "neutron,"

202
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,286
when it turns professional,
it becomes a proton.

203
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,331
And if it runs for office,
it's an electron.

204
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,325
(Lisa gulping, sighs)

205
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,287
Lisa, did you just drink that?

206
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,708
(slurred) How'd you guess?

207
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,796
No, "sheriously." Oh, wow.

208
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,591
Wow, my first slurred word.

209
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:15,386
Dad, a college education is important.

210
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,721
It's my only hope
for getting me out of this--

211
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,557
pardon me, Mom-- dump.

212
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,562
Lisa, go to bed right now.

213
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,984
-Oh, keep your pants on, lady. Dad!
-(gasps)

214
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,733
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad!

215
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,066
I believe in higher education.

216
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,901
You are a teacher.

217
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,777
If you make a joke out of it,

218
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,583
(voice breaking)
you are crushing my only hope.

219
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,908
(sobbing)

220
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,203
As the good kid here, I have to point out
she's acting very badly.

221
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,078
For shame.

222
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,464
Lisa, sweetie, my professor money's

223
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,292
going into your college fund.

224
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,337
Ooh, that's good, I guess.
How much is in it now?

225
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,592
Depends on what we do
with Grampa after he dies.

226
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,054
Just burn me!

227
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,354
Ooh, well, that's the most expensive
option I'm considering.

228
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,509
BURNS: Welcome to Burns University.

229
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,308
Don't park at Del Taco.

230
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,309
Our motto-- <i>Ut uberiores divites.</i>

231
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,725
Well, doesn't that mean
"The rich get richer"?

232
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,475
Ooh, this prestigious school

233
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,317
doesn't need
Latin-translating troublemakers.

234
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,652
You're expelled!

235
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,487
{\an8}(speaking Latin)

236
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,822
{\an8}"Non refundum!"

237
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,156
(dog barking)

238
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,741
When do I throw this in the air?

239
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,946
You're a professor,
so you don't throw it.

240
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,577
In fact, you hardly ever wear it.

241
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,293
Geez, I had this custom-made.

242
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,923
{\an8}-Apartheid's over, Lenny.
-It worked!

243
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,591
Mm-hmm.

244
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,510
Man, copying is so hard.

245
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,130
-Any questions?
-Yes. What does it mean?

246
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,347
Uh, what do you think it means?

247
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,008
Remember, there are no wrong answers.

248
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,767
Well, I would guess that, uh,

249
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,599
three neutrons coming out
when only one went in,

250
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,274
uh, leads to some kind of chain reaction.

251
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,274
Wrong. There's always a class clown.

252
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,856
Ten-minute coffee break.

253
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,780
Um, any of you homies
want to sell Schedule I narcotics

254
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,151
to a fellow teenager?

255
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,657
You're a teenager?

256
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,619
What year were you born?

257
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,119
Hey, you're not the cop around here. I am!

258
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,542
-(groans)
-What?

259
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,460
Oh, right, my cover.

260
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,868
Seriously, people.

261
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,706
Some of us are here to learn.

262
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,382
Professor, half-life of radium,
if you please.

263
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,051
-Don't look at book!
-(groans)

264
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,716
<i>Ugh. You're crushing me.</i>

265
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,218
What the hell is that?

266
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,513
Guys. You know what?

267
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,176
It's a beautiful day.

268
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,394
Why don't we have class outside?

269
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,805
Yes, that's it. Go on outside.

270
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,555
I'm totally unqualified.

271
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,977
I don't even know
how to get outside from here.

272
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,194
That's the answer!

273
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,397
Oh, wait.

274
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,323
-Hey, what's the matter, Professor?
-He don't know what to teach his class.

275
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,488
Homer's just not cut out
to be a pedagogue.

276
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,196
That's easy. You just got to register.

277
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,786
Stay away from playgrounds.

278
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,541
Oh, you said "pedagogue."

279
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,924
(sighs) So this is what it's like
to fail at something.

280
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,552
LISA: I can help you, Dad.

281
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:57,049
Aw, if it isn't Daddy's little wino.

282
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,053
No, I'm clean. One day clean.

283
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,545
-Yeah, I know that tune.
-Just come with me.

284
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,930
You don't have time to learn anything,

285
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,184
but at least you can have
a sense of mission.

286
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,347
I got these for you.

287
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,095
<i>Dead Poets Society, Stand and Deliver.</i>

288
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:13,067
Each one a portrait of a great teacher,
told by Hollywood.

289
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,069
Played by stars, each one paid

290
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,451
more than a teacher makes
in a million lifetimes.

291
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,198
I always cry at the end
of <i>Goodbye, Mr. Chips.</i>

292
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,371
Mr. Chips is my name for my Fritos.

293
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,950
Just watch the movies.

294
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,872
<i>ROBIN WILLIAMS (on TV):</i>
<i>Words and ideas can change the world.</i>

295
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,365
<i>Oh, look at the world!</i>

296
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,537
<i>It just did a boom-boom in its pants.</i>

297
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,035
<i>You, you change it.</i>

298
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,086
<i>Go to the woodshop</i>
<i>and make yourself a push broom.</i>

299
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,474
<i>You're gonna need it.</i>

300
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,722
<i>It's not a tumor.</i>

301
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,478
Oh, they were great. They inspired me.

302
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,228
And the best part is where they show
the real guy over the credits.

303
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,311
He looks just like the actor but fatter.

304
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,646
-(snoring)
-(door slams)

305
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,111
Okay, listen up.

306
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,151
All it takes to be a great teacher
is to care.

307
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,905
And I care. So I'm a great teacher.

308
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,778
I don't like you, and you don't like me,

309
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,946
but I'm your only ticket
out of the barrio.

310
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,285
<i>¿Comprende, ése?</i>

311
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,369
I understand. I understand plenty.

312
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,825
Do you know you can get a hot shower
by hooking up your hose

313
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,246
to your car radiator?

314
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,174
Towel off with the floor mat
and feel like a king.

315
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,343
♪ <i>Ah, cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha</i> ♪

316
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:23,262
Good. Now he can bring the rest
of the Latin Kings in line.

317
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,304
Okay, first lesson.

318
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,807
(whistle blows)

319
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,809
(Lenny shouts)

320
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,851
Always watch out for a little rod

321
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,145
falling into the back of your shirt.

322
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,519
I do it, like, every week.

323
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,525
Now remember,
your chair has three levers--

324
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,648
down, back, and lock.

325
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,355
Down, back, and lock.

326
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,945
-Together.
-ALL: Down, back, and lock!

327
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:48,161
Down, back, and lock!
Down, back, and lock!

328
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,164
Down, back, and lock!

329
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,496
Carpe diem!

330
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,501
So, Andre, is it true?
You're dropping out of my class?

331
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,094
May I ask why?

332
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,839
I... well, I...

333
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,721
I-I want to go back
to counseling at-risk teens.

334
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,639
No, Andre.
You don't get to throw your life away.

335
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,178
I'll be here for every class.

336
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,183
-Carpe diem.
-Carpe diem.

337
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,096
Just what does that mean, by the way?

338
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,354
Fish for a dime, my friend.

339
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,016
Fish for a dime.

340
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,435
(mechanical whirring)

341
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,823
How much are we charging
for hugs, Smithers?

342
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,990
Five dollars,
but, uh, I'll give you one for free.

343
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,359
-Quiet.
-Monty, I want to buy the whole school.

344
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,027
But it must include Homer Simpson.

345
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,826
He is a great teacher.

346
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,699
But first I must find out
how much he's worth to the plant.

347
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,247
(whispers indistinctly)

348
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,540
I see. It seems I owe you $100,000.

349
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,535
Great lecture, Professor S.

350
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:42,047
I finally understand how gamma rays
turned Bruce Banner into the Hulk.

351
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:46,261
Always remember the equation,
"gamma equals green."

352
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:49,183
Man, I wish you were my father, Dad.

353
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,273
Uh, Simpson, I've sold your contract.

354
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,428
No! You cannot stop me from teaching.

355
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,057
I was going to paint houses
in the summer.

356
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,645
Nothing will stop the greatest teacher
in the world from painting houses!

357
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,772
Oh, calm down.

358
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,738
You'll be working for this man
at his private estate.

359
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,279
What? Me?

360
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,952
-Alone? Without my kids?
-Yes.

361
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,742
Sounds good. Who are you?

362
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:13,075
The owner of more for-profit colleges
than anyone in the world.

363
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,252
These students are going to miss you.

364
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,710
Thank you!

365
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,503
I just want to say,

366
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,667
each and every one of you
gets an incomplete!

367
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,928
-I can't hear him. Can you?
-Nope.

368
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,471
Love was the test.

369
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,555
And you all passed.

370
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,699
(screeches)

371
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,779
<i>PILOT: Uh, folks,</i>
<i>we'll be landing at Mr. Verlander's</i>

372
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,874
<i>secret estate shortly.</i>

373
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,618
<i>A flight attendant</i>
<i>will be coming by to put</i>

374
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,164
<i>a blindfold over your eyes.</i>

375
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,917
<i>Cabin crew, please wipe your memory</i>
<i>and prepare for landing.</i>

376
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,093
Which way do I go?

377
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,597
Uh, use the map!

378
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,348
D'oh!

379
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,146
Homer Simpson.

380
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,613
<i>AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:</i>
<i>Voice does not match file from 1989.</i>

381
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:31,025
(1989 Homer voice): Let's go out
for frosty chocolate milkshakes.

382
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,195
<i>Welcome, Homer Simpson.</i>

383
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,502
Whoa.

384
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,208
Hmm.

385
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:41,038
Hmm? You unload your own dishwasher?

386
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,495
Yeah.
If you don't, you get a funny smell.

387
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,705
Now, come in.
Are you tired from your trip?

388
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,466
Let's get you a refreshing cryofreeze.

389
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,179
{\an8}Rejuvenating, huh?

390
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,839
{\an8}It opens your pores.

391
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,347
-Uh, what happens if I pee in this?
-Are you just asking?

392
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,271
-Or did you already pee in it?
-I'm asking for a friend.

393
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,060
So what's our next activity?

394
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,854
I hope it's not square dancing.

395
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,767
I'd like you to meet
the rest of my guests.

396
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,896
Hmm.

397
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:08,072
Homer, say hello to
the greatest educators in the world.

398
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,532
Neil deGrasse Tyson, astrophysicist.

399
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:14,702
The solar system is over
four and a half billion years old.

400
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,373
<i>Jeopardy! </i>champion of champions,
Ken Jennings.

401
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,543
Who is "glad to meet you"?

402
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,671
Financial educator Suze Orman.

403
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,379
You are not allowed to buy a Mercedes

404
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,419
until you pay off your credit cards.

405
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,212
Great, now you tell me.

406
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,416
Screenwriting guru Robert McKee.

407
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,716
Welcome to the act three climax,

408
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,340
resolution of story and subplots.

409
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,062
I expect you're wondering
why I've assembled a team

410
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,680
of the world's greatest teachers.

411
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,600
-To teach something.
-To somebody.

412
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,266
Well, there are only six basic plots.

413
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,225
Rise-fall, fall-rise,

414
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,226
steady fall, steady rise,

415
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,448
black cop-white cop,
and stop that wedding.

416
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,449
Well, here's what I'm up to.

417
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,081
This is Sallie.

418
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,198
And these are Sallie.

419
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,115
And those are Sallie!

420
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,874
And those... are Sullys.

421
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:06,036
Robot replicas of
the greatest pilot of all time.

422
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,206
He lost all their bags.
No one talks about that.

423
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,756
You are the greatest living educators,
of humans.

424
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,971
But now you must face
the greatest challenge of your lives--

425
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:19,933
Can you teach an artificial intelligence?

426
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,555
To teach a robot.

427
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,142
Now you've compounded my interest.

428
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,317
That was a very useful time cut.

429
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,649
Now, let's find out what's going on.

430
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,605
Leave that to me, Robert.
What's going on?

431
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,156
I'll tell you,
and I won't kill you afterwards.

432
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,197
What? This is a student loan application.

433
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,117
Mm. Sallie...

434
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,616
Sallie Mae?

435
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,787
The Federal Student Loan Program?

436
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,706
You're creating an army of robots
so advanced

437
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,296
-that they can get student loans.
-That's right.

438
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,932
These stu-bots-- or ro-dents,
if you prefer--

439
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,009
will attend the universities
I've been buying up

440
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,345
and funnel billions
of taxpayer dollars to me.

441
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,851
That's it. As Americans,

442
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,023
it's our duty to either
stop evil billionaires

443
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,862
or elect them to the highest office.

444
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,730
Well, we've done it.

445
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,936
You're all up to
your polyurethane necks in debt

446
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,196
and heading to Yale.

447
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,819
Follow me.

448
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,315
SALLIES:
Boola Boola. Boola Boola.

449
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,698
Good luck, Homer.

450
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,004
Will I see you at the last minute
saving the day?

451
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,748
Nah, too clichéd.

452
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,792
The Sallies have blended right in.

453
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,208
We've got 12 productions
of <i>The Crucible</i> going,

454
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,837
and the deepest Division III
women's lacrosse team

455
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,344
the world has ever seen.

456
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,596
(Homer murmuring)

457
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,428
They're perfect students in every way.

458
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,351
And that's their weakness.

459
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,782
Bleep, blop, bloop.

460
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,319
Bleep, bloop, blorp.

461
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,652
I am a robot, too.

462
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,487
My father was a toaster.

463
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,872
He's in botface.

464
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,948
That's unbelievably offensive.

465
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,914
-Microaggression.
-Cultural appropriation.

466
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,535
-Offensive.
-Offensive.

467
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,082
ALL: Offensive.

468
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,754
Dear Lord,
those teachers made them too human.

469
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,545
You've ruined me.
Well, not completely.

470
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,960
I still have my health.

471
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,797
So, how much will it cost
if my daughter applies in ten years?

472
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,216
-$2,000.
-That's not so bad.

473
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,135
-That's the application fee.
-Oh, yeah.

474
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,848
Lisa, do you see them?

475
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,558
The rings of Saturn.

476
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,688
I do.

477
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,244
The question is, what is five-sixths?

478
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,238
Marge, listen to me.
You can't fix stupid.

479
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,451
You have to kill him for the insurance.

480
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,241
I've always said these tags are pointless.

481
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,656
