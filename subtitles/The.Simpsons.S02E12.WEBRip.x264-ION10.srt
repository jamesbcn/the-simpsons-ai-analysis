I'm sorry. I don't even
know your name.

175
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:09,716
-I'm Homer-- J
-Three days. Four days.

176
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,894
-Simpson.
-Five days.

177
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,472
-It was worth it.
-Six days!

178
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:16,437
Okay, Simpson,
to the back of the room.

179
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,099
So, it was
love at first sight.

180
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,727
It was a
jailhouse romance, man.

181
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,574
I reached step one--
she knew I existed.

182
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,030
The only problem was
she didn't care.

183
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,204
-What's the matter, boy?
-HOMER: Nothing.

184
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,871
You haven't said 'boo'
all night,

185
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:30,909
and usually I have to
wrestle the bucket

186
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,122
out of your greasy mitts.

187
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,951
Dad, I'm in love.

188
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,746
Uh-oh. Why don't you
grab yourself a beer, boy.

189
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,081
But Dad, I don't drink--

190
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,376
Cut the crap.

191
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,169
"I just collect the cans,
Daddy."

192
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,884
Now grab yourself a beer
and get me one too.

193
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,675
Now. This girlfriend of yours,
is she a real looker?

194
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,100
-Uh-huh.
-A lot on the ball?

195
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:55,269
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, son, don't overreach.

196
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:59,099
Go for the dented car,
the dead-end job,

197
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,107
the less
attractive girl.

198
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,359
Oh, well, I blame myself.

199
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,531
I should have had this talk
a long time ago.

200
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,820
Thanks, Pop.

201
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:12,663
A-b-c-d-e-f-g-h-i-
j-k-l-m-n-o-p-s.

202
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,242
Hi, I'm Homer Simpson.

203
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,407
I need some guidance,
counselor.

204
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,945
Okey-dokey.

205
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,538
(sighs)
Good Lord.

206
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,504
Simpson, you should have come
to see me a long time ago.

207
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,844
Yeah, maybe, but I just met
this girl Marge Bouvier

208
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,630
and I want to force
her to like me.

209
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,473
Well, that's not exactly
the type of guidance I give.

210
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,799
-Oh...
-Well, I like to think

211
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,094
I do something helpful

212
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,007
for every student
"N" through "Z."

213
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,425
Uh, the only advice
I can give you is...

214
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,675
try to share common interests
and spend, spend, spend.

215
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,398
Well, what interests does she
have that I could make common?

216
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,519
Oh, I believe she's very
active on the Forensics Team.

217
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,316
They meet in
the new building. Room 219.

218
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,779
Far out!

219
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,069
Homer, do you have any plans
for after graduation?

220
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:54,284
Me? I'm gonna drink a lot of
beer and stay out all night.

221
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,447
Oh, no, I meant career wise.

222
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,076
You know, that nuclear power plant
will be opening soon.

223
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,413
It's one of the
few outfits around

224
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,248
that won't require
a college education.

225
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:06,634
Me? In a nuclear power plant.

226
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,962
(laughs)

227
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,417
Kaboom!

228
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,928
But bringing up a son--

229
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,009
even a blind one--

230
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,715
isn't a lifetime
occupation.

231
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,765
Now the more
you help him,

232
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:21,268
-the more you hurt him.
-(applause)

233
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,652
Woe unto Shelbyville

234
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,808
should they underestimate
our strength

235
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:24,936
in dramatic
interpretation.

236
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,692
Thank you, Artie.

237
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,074
(clears throat)
My name's Homer Simpson.

238
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,530
I'd like to sign up
for something.

239
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,400
Well, we have an opening
on the Debate team.

240
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,067
-Debate? Like arguing?
-Yes.

241
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,445
I'll take that,
you stinkpot!

242
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,493
Just warming up,
Mrs. Bloomenstein.

243
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,117
This year's topic is

244
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,253
Resolved:
The national speed limit

245
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,370
should be lowered
to 55 miles per hour.

246
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,587
55? That's ridiculous.

247
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,128
Sure, that'll save
a few lives,

248
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,842
but millions will be late.

249
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,803
Why don't you take 'con'.

250
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:56,723
<i>♪♪ ("Pick Up The Pieces")</i>

251
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,441
No way.

252
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,809
ARTIE:
Our current speed limit

253
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,225
-is an anachronism.
-Ignoramus.

254
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,975
-Will you shut up.
-Wait a minute.

255
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,476
That word you keep
calling me--

256
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,188
-Ignoramus.
-Ignoramus?

257
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,948
It means I'm stupid,
doesn't it?

258
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,070
There is a difference
between ignorance and stupidity.

259
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,157
Not to me there isn't,
you--

260
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,621
-Homer.
-Ignoramus.

261
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,241
-You're the ignoramus.
-No, you are.

262
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,908
Homer, would you like
to present your rebuttal?

263
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,576
With pleasure.

264
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,254

266
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,256
Hello.

267
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,760
Hello.

268
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,181
Oh, you may not remember me.
I'm Homer Simpson.

269
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,970
-I mooned for rebuttal.
-Yes, I remember.

270
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,385
So, uh... you want
to go out with me?

271
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,524
Well, I, uh--

272
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,141
I don't think
you're my type.

273
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,597
Well, uh, you see--

274
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,977
you see the problem is
you don't know me.

275
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,315
I have references.

276
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,489
Just ask...
Coach Flanagan,

277
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:56,488
and ask Mr. Sakofsky
and Barney Gumble.

278
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,452
I don't know.

279
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,202
Look, I'm not asking you
to like me.

280
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,994
I'm not asking you to put
yourself in the position

281
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,328
where I can touch
your goodies.

282
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,962
I'm just asking you
to be fair.

283
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,039
Homer Simpson? Oh, yeah.

284
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,674
Junior varsity shot-putter.
Mm-hmm.

285
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,501
I think if he applies himself,

286
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,006
you know, trains real hard,
hits the weights some more,

287
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,969
he could go another foot.

288
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,299
I had him for four years.
Solid "C" student.

289
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,386
Made a lamp last year.

290
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:24,271
He's all things to all men
and maybe to one lucky gal.

291
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,390
Want to go to the prom
with me?

292
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,057
Good God, no!

293
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,515
Well put.

294
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,265
Well, what's the good word?

295
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,727
-I'm sorry.
-What?

296
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,738
Well, you seem like
a nice enough guy,

297
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,900
but I don't really
don't have the time.

298
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,487
Wha--

299
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,912
And the City Forensics
Championship is coming up.

300
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,741
-Yeah, so?
-Oh, and I tutor part time.

301
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,288
-You tutor?
-Yes.

302
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,371
And anyone can be tutored?

303
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,075
Just those who need help
with French.

304
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,625
-French.
-Mm-hmm.

305
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,879
What a coincidence.

306
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,051
Just the subject
I'm having trouble with.

307
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,051
-(chuckling)
-Why, you cagey old dog.

308
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,514
Great story.
Positively spellbinding.

309
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,434
-Work, damn you! Work!
-Bart! Pay attention.

310
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,604
You may be telling this
to your own son one day

311
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,683

Oh-- (chuckles)

315
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,437
Well, there's plenty more
where that came from.

316
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,565
Uh-oh, a zit.

317
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,362
No problemo.

318
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,491

319
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,783

Why is there
make-out music on?

00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,472
It helps me study.

Homer, you're amazing.

Before, you couldn't
say <i>"bonjour,"</i>

343

but now you can conjugate

344

all the regular verbs,
two irregular verbs,

345
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,972

I can't believe it.
It's sticking.

350
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,729
You're telling me new stuff,

351
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,653
and minutes later,
it's still there.

352
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,401
And it's all thanks to you.

353
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,823
Marge, when I see you forming
the vowels and continents--

354
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,323
-Consonants.
-Consonants

355
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,744
with your beautiful mouth
and your beautiful breath

356
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,494
pushing them past
your beautiful teeth--

357
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,996
<i>Merci,</i> I guess.

358
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,659
Marge...

359
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,787
would you go
to the prom with me?

360
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,584
You know, Homer,

361
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,878
you're like no one
I've ever met before.

362
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,262
You're dear,
honest and open

363
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,929
without a trace
of pretension.

364
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,258
I'll take that as a compliment.

365
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,553
So will you go out with me?

366
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,756
Please say <i>oui.</i>

367
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,347
<i>-Oui. </i>
-Woo-hoo!

368
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,521
Marge, this will be the greatest night
of your life.

369
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,440
I've been saving up
for a new engine for my car

370
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,059
but I'm gonna spend it
all on us.

371
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,555
I'm renting
the biggest limo.

372
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,437
I'm gonna buy you
the biggest corsage.

373
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,744
My tux is gonna have the widest lapels,
the most ruffles,

374
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,569
and the highest
platform shoes you ever saw.

375
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,655
Maybe I'll wear
my hair... up.

376
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,041
Wait, wait, wait, Marge.

377
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,079
If honest and open
is what you like,

378
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,583
get a load of this.

379
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,915
I'm not really
in any French class.

380
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,751
This was just a brilliant scheme
to get to know you better.

381
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:40,797
-Hmm!
-(smack)

382
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,380
Ow.

383
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:45,224
You knew the city Forensics
finals are tomorrow,

384
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,841
and you kept me here
until 1:00 a.m.

385
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,847
pretending to be stupid!

386
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,390
Homer J. Simpson,
I hate you!

387
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,861
Hey, Barney.

388
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,859
Guess who's got a date
for the prom!

389
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,615
Everything I know tells me
this story doesn't end

390
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,449
with us sitting here
and you telling it to us.

391
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,994
Get off the edge of your seat.

392
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,197
They got married, had kids
and bought a cheap TV, okay?

393
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:17,538
MARGE: Bringing up a son,
even a blind one,

394
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,165
isn't a lifetime occupation.

395
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,262
Now the more you... help him--

396
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,839
-Terrible.
-MARGE: The more you hurt him.

397
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,875
(groans)

398
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,215
Congratulations, Artie.

399
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,434
Marge, this may not be
the most appropriate forum

400
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,265
for what I'm about to
put forth,

401
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,691
but--
(clears throat)

402
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,100
would you go
to the prom with me?

403
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,688
Well--

404
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,363
I can think of a dozen
highly cogent arguments.

405
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,402
Well, the first is from
"Time Magazine,"

406
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,146
Dated January 8th, 1974.

407
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,737
"America's love affair
with the prom.

408
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,703
"Even wallflowers
can look forward

409
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,834
-to one date a year--"
-No, Artie, Artie.

410
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,541
The best argument
is that

411
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,751
I've known and
respected you for eight years,

412
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,041
and I would be delighted
to go to the prom with you.

413
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,711
If you pinch your cheeks,
they'll glow.

414
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,218
A little more.

415
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,759
Try to break
some capillaries, dear.

416
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,642
Couldn't we just use rouge
for this?

417
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:14,429
Ladies pinch.
Whores use rouge.

418
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,305
Is Marge here?

419
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,564
-Who...
-Or what are you?

420
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,936
-I'm her date.
-Mm-hm.

421
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,902
I suppose you want to
come in and sit down?

422
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,323
-Okay.
-Marge's dates

423
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,151
-get homelier all the time.
-Mm-hm.

424
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,986
That's what you get
when you don't put out.

425
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:34,913
You know, I usually insist
on approving Marge's dates,

426
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,874
but from what she's told me,
I'm sure you're a solid citizen.

427
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,865
-Thanks, Mr. B.
-(grunting)

428
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,038
MRS. BOUVIER:
Here she comes.

429
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,086
Get the camera ready.

430
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,545
Homer!

431
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,841
(camera shutter clicks)

432
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,890
What are you doing here?

433
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,562
You said you'd go
to the prom with me.

434
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,890
Well, I also said
I hated you,

435
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,806
and we haven't even
talked since then.

436
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,904
-I was afraid you'd cancel our date--
-(doorbell rings)

437
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,650
So I stayed away
from you completely,

438
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,652
even though it meant
skipping school for three weeks

439
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,994
and graduating this summer...
I hope.

440
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,660
I'm Artie Ziff,
Marge's date for the prom.

441
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,371
Well, hello.

442
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,451
Well, hello, hello.

443
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,956
-Don't we look handsome?
-Yes, indeed, we do.

444
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,829
Well, come in,
young man.

445
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,245
Wait a second.

446
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,093
If he's your date,
who are you?

447
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,510
I'm... a spare.
Excuse me.

448
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,840
Now that that unpleasantness
is behind us forever,

449
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,137
let's take a picture
of the happy couple.

450
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,181
Say "Cheese Whiz."

451
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,184
Hey, buddy,
where's your date?

452
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,437
-She's with him.
-DRIVER: Ouch.

453
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,190
So I guess you want me to
take you home, huh?

454
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,982
Hey! I paid for this car,

455
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,896
I paid for this tuxedo and
I paid for the two dinners.

456
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,855

-Prom it is.

meant to be together.

a thought,

504
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,732
there's a lot of
other thoughts in there.

00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,637
-Please?
-No, really, I mean it!

519
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,682
Now stop it!
(gasps)

520
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,936
(panting)
I'm sorry, Marge.

521
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,388
Take me home, Artie.

522
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,398
Well, it's 1:00.
If you want to keep me

523
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,321
I'm afraid it's gonna be
$45 an hour.

524
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,200
Nah, that's okay.
I'm broke.

525
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,528
I'll walk home.

526
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,163
Yeah, why spoil
a perfect evening?

527
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,161
♪♪

528
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,665
Marge, I would appreciate it

529
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,593
if you didn't tell anybody
about my busy hands.

530
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:01,183
Not so much for myself,
but I am so respected,

531
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,100
it would damage the town
to hear it.

532
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,219
-Good night.
-Yeah, right.

533
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,227
MR. BOUVIER: You know, when that
Simpson boy showed up,

534
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,059
it took years off my life.

535
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,064
MRS. BOUVIER: Will you stop it?
She went out with the good one.

536
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,032
-(horn honking)
-Shut up!

537
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,662
-(horn honking)
-I'm over as far as I can go.

538
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,409
-(horn honking)
-All right! All right!

539
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,292
I'll walk in the mud!

540
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,911
-Homer?
-Marge?

541
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,668
-Yeah. You want a ride?
-Sure.

542
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,627
You know, Homer,
when I got home,

543
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,173
I realized who I should have
gone to the prom with.

544
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,257
Who?
Oh...

545
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,682
Hi, prom date.

546
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,010
Marge, <i>pour vous.</i>

547
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,267
Mmm.

548
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,729
Why so glum?

549
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,059
(sighs)
I got a problem.

550
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,646
Once you stop this car,

551
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,441
I'm going to hug you
and kiss you,

552
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,145
and then I'll never be able
to let you go.

553
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,696
And I never have.

00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,780
