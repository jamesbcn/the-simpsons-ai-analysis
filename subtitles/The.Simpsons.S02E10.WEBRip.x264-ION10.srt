Please allow me

I'm the devil.

(evil laugh) And you've earned
eternal damnation

38
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,009

00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,175

Let's just pull up

00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,953
Hmm. Seems to be a mistake.

47
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,529
According to this,
you're not due to arrive here

48
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,124
until the next time
the Yankees win the pennant.

49
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,579
That's nearly

Boy, is my face red.

00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,948
Bart? Bart?

52
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,368
Um, say, is there
anything I can do

53
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,667
to avoid
coming back here?

54
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,790
Oh, sure, yeah,
but you wouldn't like it.

55
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,048
Okay. See you later, then.

56
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,169
Good-bye, Bart.

57
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,585

lie, cheat, steal

58
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,844

Intercom: <i>Doctor Warner, you're</i>

61
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,609
-He's awake!
-Oh, Bart, we thought for a minute

62
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,111
-you'd gone away from us.
-I did go away, Mom.

63
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,404
I was miles and miles
and miles away,

64
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,278
writhing in agony
in the pits of hell,

65
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,156
and you were there.

66
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,753
And you and you and you...

67
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,748
You I've never seen before.

68
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,880
Hey, yeah, who are you?
I saw you chasing Bart's ambulance.

69
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,089
Hutz is the name, Mr. Simpson.
Lionel Hutz, attorney at law.

70
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,670
Here's my card. It turns into a sponge
when you put it in water.

71
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,876
Ooh, classy.

72
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,336
I'd like to talk to you about
bringing legal action

73
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,046
against the fiend
who did this to your boy.

74
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:27,137
Well, the fiend who did this
to my boy is my boss.

75
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,435
And besides, the doctor says

76
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,059
it's just a bump on the head
and a broken toe. Nothing serious.

77
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,646
Doctors. Doctors are idiots.

78
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,612
There's no telling what kind
of permanent injuries he might have.

79
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,244
You might have to wait on him
hand and foot

80
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,820
for the rest
of his natural life.

81
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,236
That's the downside.

82
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,914
Now here's the good part.
You can ching, ching, ching,

83
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,504
-cash in on this tragedy.
-Wow.

84
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,249
Excuse me, Mr. Hutz.
Are you a shyster?

85
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,132
How does a nice little girl
like you, know a big word like that?

86
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,130
Mr. Hutz, this is hardly
the time or place

87
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,012
to discuss this.

88
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,379
You're right, you're right.
When you feel up to it

89
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,836
come over to my office
and we'll talk about it.

90
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,347
Lionel Hutz,
attorney at law.

91
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,469
What's that, a broken neck?
Great!

92
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,057
-Hello, Dr. Hibbert.
-Hello, Lisa.

93
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,233
Well, we've got a nasty bump
on our head, haven't we?

94
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,942
-Ow! Quit it.
-And a little tiny broken toe.

95
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,483
Ow. quit it.

96
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,816
Is he well enough for me
to mother him unbearably, Doctor?

97
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:23,872
Mmm, better let him
rest up a while first.

98
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,118
Hey, Simpson, I heard
Mr. Burns crushed your boy.

99
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,120
Yeah. If I wasn't so spineless,

100
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:33,173
I'd march into Mr. Burns'
office right now and...

101
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,169
-Simpson.
-(screams, chokes)

102
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,711
Mr. Burns wants you to march
into his office right now.

103
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:37,634
Uh-oh.

104
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,295
Ah, Simpson, at last we meet.

105
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,514
Nice to meet you too, sir.

106
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,465
Yes. My attorneys
have advised me

107
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,465
to pay you for running
over your child,

108
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:53,227
-so I'm cutting you a check.
-Really? Great.

109
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:57,855
(straining)

110
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:03,147
$100. Of course,
you'll have to sign a waiver

111
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,947
relinquishing your right to sue
and so forth. Merely a formality.

112
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,872
A hundred bucks?

113
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,160
It's a very generous offer,
sir, but medical bills alone--

114
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:15,626
Oh, so extortion is the name
of your little game, is it Simpson?

115
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,208
Very well.
Then you get nothing.

116
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,674
I have the finest lawyers
in Springfield, Simpson.

117
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:24,625
Tangle with me, and
I'll crush you like a paper cup.

118
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,047
(straining)

119
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,723
Throw him out, Smithers.

120
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,727
You don't have
to do that, Mr. Burns.

121
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,809
I can throw myself out.

122
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,194
(door slams)

123
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,903
Ooh... Lionel Hutz.

124
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,070
Right in here,
Mr. Simpson.

125
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,197
Any calls, Della?

126
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,163
Calls? Oh, calls.

127
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,754
Yes, uh, the Supreme Court
called again.

128
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,370
They need your help
on some freedom thing.

129
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,377
Tell them to sit tight.
I'll get back to them.

130
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,129
This way, Mr. Simpson.

131
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,921
You sure have got
some education, Mr. Hutz.

132
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,427
Yes, Harvard, Yale,

133
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,589
M.I.T., Oxford,
The Sorbonne, The Louvre...

134
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,558
-(siren begins wailing)
-Oh. Oh, well.

135
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,600
Mr. Simpson,
the state bar forbids me

136
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,895
from promising you
a big cash settlement,

137
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,309
but just between you and me,

138
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:24,358
I promise you
a big cash settlement.

139
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,534
My fee is 50%.

140
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,901
50%?

141
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,198
You'll be getting more
than just a lawyer, Mr. Simpson.

142
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,992
You'll also be getting

143
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:34,445
this exquisite fauxpearl
necklace-- a $99 value--

144
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,827
as our gift to you.

145
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,253
Well, I don't know.

146
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,463
You and I might have
different ideas

147
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,514
about just how big
a big cash settlement is.

148
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,129
A million dollars?

149
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,505
Whoo-hoo! Oh!
I stand corrected.

150
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,223
A million bucks is a-okay.

151
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,565
(wolf whistle)

152
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,648
Now we'll get
a real doctor's opinion.

153
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,776
-Bad news.
-Oh?

154
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,284
Your son is a very sick boy.

155
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,576
Just look at the x-rays.

156
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,790
You see that dark spot there?

157
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,331
Whiplash.

158
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,964
Whiplash? Oh, no.

159
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,131
And this smudge here
that looks like my fingerprint?

160
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,011
No, that's trauma.

161
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,718
-Mmm.
-Am I gonna die?

162
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:32,219
-Yes, son.
-Homer!

163
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,143
No, of course you're not
going to die.

164
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,233
Everything's fine.

165
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,348
Will I ever
play baseball again?

166
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,555
No!

167
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,055
(sobbing)

168
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,226
But I played baseball
this morning.

169
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,725
That's right, he did.

170
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,146
Excuse me,
but Dr. Hibbert has been

171
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,816
our family physician
for years

172
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,324
and he thought Bart was fine.

173
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,485
Oh, Dr. Hibbert

174
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,874
(sarcastically)
from Johns Hopkins Medical School.

175
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:59,002
With all due respect, Mrs. Simpson,
you're not a doctor.

176
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,170
The boy's not a doctor.
I'm not a doctor.

177
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,839
The only person in this room
who even comes close is this man.

178
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,209
Stop, you're embarrassing me.

179
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,676
Doctor, are you sure there isn't
a little soft tissue trauma

180
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,178
in the facial area?

181
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,600
Oh, yeah, tons of it.

182
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,759
Just say when.

183
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:21,847
A million dollars? Smithers!
I want this Homer J. Simpson fired.

184
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,436
Uh, do you think that's
wise, Mr. Burns?

185
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,232
I mean,
think of the headlines.

186
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,494
BURNS: Hmm?

187
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:31,903
Hmm?

188
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,699
Ooh.

189
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,662
What about the headlines?

190
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,912
Well, the press might
be critical of you

191
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,245
for firing the crippled boy's
father so soon after the accident.

192
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,871
Well, all right then.

193
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,248
I don't want
to seem like an ogre.

194
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,915
I'll bide my time.

195
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,835
Let him twist in
the wind slowly, slowly.

196
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:57,135
And then, when the papers have found
their new flavor of the month,

197
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,431
they'll find out
this cat has claws!

198
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,555
Good thinking, sir.

199
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:05,612
Now let's pretend
you're on the witness stand.

200
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,188
-How are you, Bart?
-Fine.

201
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,324
(pleasantly) Oh fine, isn't that nice?
Bart says he's fine.

202
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,401
Wrong! You are not fine!
You're in constant pain!

203
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,777
I am in constant pain.

204
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,155
Dad, may I please make
an observation?

205
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,002
-What is it?
-I think this is all a charade

206
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,498
to make Bart look more injured
than he really is.

207
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,421
Maybe Lisa does have a point.

208
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,129
I don't mind you boys
doing this in the living room,

209
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,420
but in court, doesn't Bart
have to tell the truth?

210
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,424
Yeah, but what is truth,
if you follow me?

211
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:37,087
Now, Bart, can you roll your eyes
back in your head like this?

212
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,889
Oh, you mean like I'm dead?
Yeah, sure.

213
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,893
The kid's a pro.

214
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,055
Springfield Municipal Court
is now in session,

215
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,305
Judge Multon presiding.

216
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,107
Your Honor, my client
has instructed me

217
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,362
to remind the court how rich
and important he is,

218
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,154
that he is not like
other men.

219
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,907
I should be able to run over
as many kids as I want!

220
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,120
(gasping)

221
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,084
Mr. Burns, I must warn you

222
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,333
that if you continue to disrupt
the court in this way,

223
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,575
I will have to cite you
for contempt.

224
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,418
You wouldn't dare.

225
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,633
Well, no, I guess I wouldn't.

226
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:16,183
Calling Bartholomew J. Simpson
to the stand.

227
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,468
(crowd groans)

228
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,973
Oh, please.

229
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,345
Hello, Bart.

230
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,641
Now you know the difference

231
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,895
between telling the truth
and telling a lie,

232
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,018
don't you, son?

233
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,225
-Maybe.
-Uh-huh.

234
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,065
Well, you wouldn't lie
to the United States,

235
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,361
would you, Bart?

236
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,445
-No.
-No.

237
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,120
-No.
-Good.

238
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,738
-Proceed, Mr. Hutz.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

239
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,196
Now, Bart, I want you
to tell the jury,

240
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,906
in your own words,

241
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,116
exactly what happened
on the day of the accident.

242
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,537
Yes, sir.

243
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,455
It was a beautiful
Sunday afternoon.

244
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,665
<i>I was playing in</i>
<i>my wholesome, childlike way,</i>

245
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,375
<i>little realizing that I was</i>
<i>about to be struck down</i>

246
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,086
<i>by the luxury car of death.</i>

247
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,103
(children screaming)

248
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,061
Defenseless child at 3:00.

249
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,062
(evil laughter)

250
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,605
<i>Luckily, I was not killed</i>
<i>that day,</i>

251
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:19,663
although sometimes,
I wish I had been.

252
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,237
Oh, he's lying.

253
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:28,157
Now that's
believable testimony.

254
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,787
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

255
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,205
Now, Mr. Burns, would you please
relate in your own words

256
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:38,545
exactly what really happened
on the day of the accident?

257
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,552
Certainly.
Oh, it was a beautiful day.

258
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:45,925
<i>The sun was shining. I was driving</i>
<i>to the orphanage to pass out toys.</i>

259
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,765
<i>Suddenly, that</i>
<i>incorrigible Simpson boy</i>

260
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,601
<i>-darted in front of me.</i>
-(Burns stammering)

261
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,357
(laughing)

262
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,277
Ahh!

263
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,988
Oh, my goodness.
Look what's happened.

264
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,109
Oh, it's not important, sir.
Let's drive on.

265
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,907
Why, you despicable,
cold-blooded monster.

266
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:08,041
Regardless of what you think, we will
summon help and comfort the dear boy

267
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,710
until an ambulance arrives.

268
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,000
No!

269
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,004
Take me!

270
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,295
I'm old!

271
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,009
And that's what happened.

272
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,682
What are you looking at me
like that for?

273
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,473
You believed
his cock-and-bull story.

274
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,346
It's looking good,
Mr. Simpson.

275
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,193
It's looking very, very good.

276
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,359
They hate me?

277
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,018
What trial were you watching?

278
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,436
Maybe a settlement--

279
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,355
Oh, yes, settlements, fine.

280
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,743
Hang your heads in shame,

281
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,781
you over-priced, under-brained,
glorified notary publics!

282
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,696
BURNS: Just get that big ape
to my house tonight,

283
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,445
and we'll buy him off
with a banana or two.

284
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,958
{\an8}...and that ugly customer

285
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,880
{\an8}was the last Indonesian
rhino on Earth.

286
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,800
Hmm. I didn't know
you liked animals.

287
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,629
Oh, I don't like
everything about them,

288
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,554
-just their heads.
-(both snicker)

289
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,184
Wwll, would you care
for some wine, old buddy?

290
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,562
-Don't mind if I do.
-Go, go.

291
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,230
Bottoms up, Simpson.
There's plenty more where that came from.

292
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,227
Mr. Burns, are you trying
to get me drunk?

293
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,525
Yes. Now then Homer,
old chum,

294
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,360
I'm sure you'll agree
with me that this trial

295
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,525
is an affront to our
collective dignity.

296
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,834
What do you say we
settle this man-to-man?

297
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:32,499
-You mean duke it out?
-Oh, no.

298
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,000
I mean I'm prepared
to offer you

299
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,542
a most generous
cash settlement.

300
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,665
A princely sum--

301
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:43,423
Well, a handsome sum that
can end this little imbroglio

302
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,217
once and for all.

303
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:51,432
$500,000.

304
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,305
-Goodness.
-Bup-bup-bup!

305
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,102
Don't answer me now.

306
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,765
Relax, talk it over
with the missus.

307
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,484
Soak in the opulence
of your surroundings,

308
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,775
and dream of what might be.

309
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,779
Smithers, let's go
powder my nose.

310
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,819
Well, Marge,
what do you think?

311
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,616
Well, I don't know.
Maybe we should take his money

312
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,200
and put all this ugliness
behind us.

313
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,616
Hmm. The fish is in the pan.

314
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,916
MARGE:
What do you think, Homer?

315
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,709
I'll tell you what I think.

316
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,342
I think he thinks
I'm an idiot!

317
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,760
The only reason
he's offering us this

318
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,679
is because he knows
he's gonna lose at trial

319
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,339
and have to pay us
a cool million.

320
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,137
Oh! I feel faint.

321
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,310
$500,000!

322
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,519
I spit on his $500,000!

323
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,939
-Hmm.
-Homer, what's happened to you?

324
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,693
All this greediness and lying

325
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,935
and shifty lawyers
and phony doctors...

326
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,027
Phony doctors? Hello.

327
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,702
Do you know what I'd settle for,
if it was up to me?

328
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,662
Bart's medical bills
and an apology.

329
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,622
And you won't even get that.
Sorry. Offer's expired.

330
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,333
I guess we'll just have to let the jury
decide. Twelve good men and true.

331
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,084
Good day.
Smithers, release the hounds.

332
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,956
(snarling, barking)

333
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,591
-(gavel bangs)
-Your Honor,

334
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,343
I would like to call
to the stand

335
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:11,345
Mrs. Homer J. Simpson.

336
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,258
(gasping, murmuring)

337
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,227
Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth

338
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,902
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

339
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,321
Mmm... Yes, I do.

340
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,691
She sounded like
she was taking that

341
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,197
-awful seriously.
-Oh, the truth.

342
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:34,081
Mrs. Simpson, does
the name Julius Hibbert

343
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,489
mean anything to you?

344
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:39,827
Yes, he's been our family
physician and trusted friend

345
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,915
ever since the day
I became a mother.

346
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,001
He's seen us through everything,
from colds to impetigo,

347
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,917
with competence
and loving care.

348
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,126
But wait a minute.
I'm confused.

349
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,887
This court heard
expert testimony

350
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,720
from one Dr. Nick Riviera.

351
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,306
-What is your opinion of him?
-Mmm.

352
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,642
-Mrs. Simpson?
-I'm sorry,

353
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,438
but my mother always said
if you can't say anything nice,

354
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,612
don't say anything at all.

355
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,030
Will that hold up in court?

356
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,738
No, I've tried it before.

357
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,608
Mrs. Simpson, what is
your opinion of Dr. Riviera?

358
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,197
And let me remind you
that you're under oath.

359
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,332
Hmm. Well, to be honest,

360
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,910
he seemed a lot
more concerned

361
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:22,496
about wrapping Bart in bandages
than in making him feel better.

362
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,753
And he mispronounced words
that even I know, like abdomen.

363
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,087
And his office was dirty.

364
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:32,433
Now that I think about it,
I'm not sure he's even a doctor.

365
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:33,339
D'oh!

366
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,007
And Mrs. Simpson,

367
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,385
could you describe for us
in your own words

368
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:41,523
Bart's intense mental
anguish and suffering?

369
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,942
-Well, I don't know how intense it was.
-Uh-huh.

370
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:48,572
But, well, I guess he did
miss three days of school.

371
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,860
-Oh, three days.
-Although he doesn't really like school

372
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,954
-all that much.
-No.

373
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,030
So I guess that may not
count as anguish.

374
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,735
-No, it doesn't, Mrs. Simpson.
-It was a little hard on me

375
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,656
having him around the house
all that time.

376
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,865
Could you put a dollar amount
on all these hardships?

377
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:07,797
Well, we pay Bart five dollars
a week to take out the trash.

378
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,168
I suppose if he'd been able
to do it that week,

379
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,256
we might have
given him the $5.

380
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,972
Five dollars?

381
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,512
But your lawyer,
assuming he is a lawyer,

382
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,386
is asking for a million.

383
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:23,103
Well, we can't blame them
for trying, can we? Heh heh.

384
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,305
Thank you very much,
Mrs. Simpson.

385
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,055
(sobbing)
Oh, Marge!

386
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,227
(sinister laughing)

387
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,147
I'm going to write a figure
on this piece of paper.

388
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,527
It's not quite as large
as the last one,

389
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:39,624
-but I think you'll find it fair.
-(Smithers chuckles)

390
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,541
-I think we should take it.
-(shuddering)

391
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,460
HOMER (thinking):
<i>A million dollars.</i>

392
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,129
<i>My wife cost me</i>
<i>a million dollars.</i>

393
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,799
Homer, would you like some
more macaroni and cheese?

394
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,878
<i>Yeah, a million dollars worth,</i>
<i>you treacherous snake woman.</i>

395
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,505
-No, thank you.
-Some string beans?

396
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,892
<i>No, I don't want any string beans either,</i>
<i>you two-timing back-stabbing...</i>

397
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,930
<i>Uh-oh, better answer.</i>

398
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,392
No, thank you.

399
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,812
Some celery with
cream cheese on it?

400
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,560
<i>Just mouth polite nothings.</i>

401
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,892
No, thank you.

402
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,807
You know what would have
really been cool?

403
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,185
If we got that million bucks.

404
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,072
-Bart, please.
-What?

405
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,319
We could have bought tons
of great stuff, Mom.

406
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,531
Maids, a pool, fancy sweaters--

407
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,161
-Stop me if I'm wrong.
-Marge, dear,

408
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,779
would it be alright if
I went over to Moe's

409
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,826
-for a drink?
-Why, sure.

410
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,789
HOMER (thinking): <i>I don't know</i>
<i>if I'll ever come back here.</i>

411
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,580
Good night.

412
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,333
(thinking) <i>Hmm. My woman's intuition</i>
<i>is telling me something.</i>

413
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,536
<i>-I wonder what--</i>
-(door closes)

414
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,285
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

415
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,545
Well, that's it.

416
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,971
I guess this is the glass
I'm gonna die in.

417
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,300
Ah, you're better off.
Rich people aren't happy.

418
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,427
From the day they're born
till the day they die,

419
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,894
they think they're happy,
but trust me, they ain't.

420
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,146
<i>Moe. I wish he'd shut up.</i>

421
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,975
Hey. Hubba-hubba.

422
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,944
-Yow!
-Look, a chick!

423
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,065
And it's not even
ladies night.

424
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,952
Hey, hey, guys.
Knock it off.

425
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,410
HOMER: It's just my wife.

426
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,819
-Well, hello.
-Va-va-voom.

427
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,828
My name is Marge.

428
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,834
Homer, I'd like you
to forgive me

429
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,084
for doing the right thing.

430
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,126
Oh, Marge.

431
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:14,209
We've squabbled over money
before. Never this much.

432
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,296
I mean, I know this is
different than that time

433
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,551
I washed your pants with the 20 in
the pocket, but I--

434
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:22,054
No, no, no.
You think this is about money?

435
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,767
Well, it's not.
It's worse, Marge.

436
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,978
I'm afraid that from now on,
when I look at you,

437
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,690
I'm not gonna see
the wife by my side

438
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,441
or the mother of my children.

439
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:36,902
I'm just gonna see the dame
who blew my one big chance.

440
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:40,485
-What are you saying, Homer?
-I'm saying...

441
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,492
(thinking) <i>She's been your wife</i>
<i>for ten years.</i>

442
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,584
<i>You've had</i>
<i>three children together.</i>

443
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,790
<i>It's time to be honest</i>
<i>with her.</i>

444
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,079
I'm not sure
I love you anymore.

445
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,583
-(gasps)
-But don't worry.

446
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,336
I'll never let on.
I'll still do all the bed stuff.

447
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,088
-Maybe it won't be so bad.
-Oh, my Lord!

448
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,971
Well, I don't want to wait
another minute to find out

449
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,219
whether you
love me anymore.

450
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:06,181
I think that you should look me
in the eyes and find out.

451
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:10,015
-No.
-Homer, look at me.

452
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,982
<i>All right, all right, look at her</i>
<i>if it'll shut her up.</i>

453
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,653
<i>Start with the feet.</i>
<i>Still angry.</i>

454
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,481
<i>Good. Good, Homer. Good.</i>

455
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,776
<i>This is tough.</i>
<i>Need refreshment.</i>

456
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,650
<i>Ah, good old</i>
<i>trustworthy beer.</i>

457
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,737
<i>My love for you</i>
<i>will never die.</i>

458
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,533
<i>All right, all right,</i>
<i>got to look at the wife</i>

459
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:28,116
<i>straight in the eyes</i>
<i>and tell her...</i>

460
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,629
Oh, who am I kidding?

461
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,300
I love you more than ever.

462
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,048
I love you too.

463
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,760
Sorry to scare you
like that, babe.

464
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,381

465
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,257
Okay, everybody.

466
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:48,394
For the next 15 minutes,
one-third off on every pitcher.
