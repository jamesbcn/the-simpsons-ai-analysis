1
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:12,744
Yeesh. The Dollar Store has
definitely seen better days.

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,412
This low-rent dump

3
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:16,656
looks like the set of a zombie movie.

4
00:00:16,732 --> 00:00:17,823
Brands...

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,733
Brands!

6
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:23,496
No one ever heard of these brands.

7
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:26,983
Look, we spent a lot of money
on food for tonight's party,

8
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,627
so I have to scrimp on the utensils,

9
00:00:29,704 --> 00:00:31,745
paper plates, and toilet paper.

10
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:32,989
Mm.

11
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,826
Oh, great.

12
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,603
It's Helen Lovejoy.

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,607
- Quick, kids, paper towels.
- Marge? Marge Simpson.

14
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,776
I assumed that was you coming
out of the shame store,

15
00:00:44,927 --> 00:00:46,502
so I rushed right over.

16
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:47,837
Hi, Helen.

17
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,023
Stocking up on potted meat
and broken ramen packets?

18
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,785
You know,
the church pantry is always open

19
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:55,787
to the under-fortunate.

20
00:00:56,194 --> 00:00:58,698
I'm just getting some supplies

21
00:00:58,774 --> 00:01:00,016
for my birthday party tonight.

22
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:03,035
Right. Your little backyard soiree.

23
00:01:03,112 --> 00:01:04,687
For my birthday, Timothy took me

24
00:01:04,706 --> 00:01:08,466
on the Josh Groban Canadian
canal cruise.

25
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:11,861
But I'm sure your thing
will be just as fun.

26
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,789
Oh, boy.

27
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,637
What's her deal?

28
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,882
She bumped into Helen
Lovejoy at the shame store

29
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,659
and has been growling ever since.

30
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,552
Don't worry.

31
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:38,645
Whenever she comes home
with a murderous rage

32
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,648
in her cute little eyes,
she goes upstairs for a bit,

33
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:46,579
then when she comes down,
she's cool as a mule in summer school.

34
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:50,967
I wonder what she does up there
to de-stress herself so fully.

35
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,182
<i>You've reached</i>

36
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,350
<i>your imagination limit for the month.</i>

37
00:01:59,427 --> 00:02:02,503
<i>To keep imagining, please subscribe.</i>

38
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:06,766
I can't imagine,
but whatever she does, it works.

39
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:09,435
All right, my loveables.

40
00:02:09,512 --> 00:02:12,846
Let's throw me the best
birthday party ever.

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,684
Who wants crab puffs?

42
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:18,870
- Yeah.
- Ah!

43
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:21,447
Marge, this party is a hit.

44
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:23,766
Even the Springfield celebs are here.

45
00:02:23,785 --> 00:02:26,693
I know. Wolfcastle, Arnie Pye,

46
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,880
freaking Bumblebee Man is here.

47
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:30,773
And you know who's not here?

48
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:33,700
A bunch of snot-nosed children. Mwah.

49
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:34,787
Where'd you put them all?

50
00:02:36,964 --> 00:02:38,464
I'm a pimple.

51
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:41,726
I never imagined that everyone in town

52
00:02:41,803 --> 00:02:43,619
would show up for my birthday.

53
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:48,624
Of course we did, Marge.
Springfield adores you.

54
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,068
You're a bake sale legend.

55
00:02:50,144 --> 00:02:53,905
You always have spare underwear
for my Milhouse's "uh-ohs."

56
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:55,631
Plus, you're always nice to everybody,

57
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:59,726
even the town jerks, like me and,
uh, no offense, Homer.

58
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:00,820
Oh.

59
00:03:00,822 --> 00:03:03,414
By the pinots ingested in me,

60
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:07,660
I hereby decree Marge Simpson
the nicest lady in Springfield.

61
00:03:15,257 --> 00:03:18,596
Last night was like
something out of a dream.

62
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:20,747
Yeah. Can you believe
I went to work naked

63
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,675
and my teeth all fell out?

64
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:25,678
Oh... I've enjoyed
my share of balls before,

65
00:03:25,796 --> 00:03:27,438
but I was never the belle of one.

66
00:03:27,515 --> 00:03:29,682
And just when I thought
it couldn't get any better,

67
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,776
now I get to clean again.

68
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:34,779
Old sneakers, coveralls,

69
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:36,781
industrial-grade kerchief...

70
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,694
It's gone. Where is it? Where is it?

71
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,455
- Where's what?
- My box. My secret box.

72
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:47,792
- The sex box?
- No. No, my box of letters.

73
00:03:47,943 --> 00:03:48,952
What letters?

74
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,963
My secret box of hate letters.

75
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,691
But the sex box is okay?

76
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:57,784
Okay, here it goes.

77
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,637
When I was a teenager,

78
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:02,882
I would occasionally...
and I'm not proud of this...

79
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,642
get mad.

80
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,645
Stupid Tim Meadows.

81
00:04:07,796 --> 00:04:09,796
Why the hell would you leave<i> SNL?</i>

82
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,816
You're a linchpin.

83
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:14,801
<i>Then one day,
I came across this article</i>

84
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,546
<i>that would change my life forever.</i>

85
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,732
<i>It said, when someone makes you angry,</i>

86
00:04:19,808 --> 00:04:22,551
<i>write them a fiery letter
full of everything</i>

87
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:23,886
<i>you wish you could say to their face,</i>

88
00:04:23,905 --> 00:04:26,889
<i>then never send it, and poof,</i>

89
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,558
<i>the bad feelings are gone forever.</i>

90
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,653
<i>From that day forward,
I wrote hundreds of letters,</i>

91
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,651
<i>and you know what?
It made me a much nicer person.</i>

92
00:04:36,686 --> 00:04:40,753
"Go jump in a wood chipper.
Marge Simpson."

93
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:43,664
<i>And every time I wrote one,
I felt much better,</i>

94
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:48,853
<i>with all my bad feelings tucked away
and, therefore, gone.</i>

95
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,855
But those letters were just for me.

96
00:04:50,932 --> 00:04:53,858
They weren't meant to be read
by anyone, ever.

97
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:55,509
We have to find them.

98
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:58,754
Honey, relax. I'm sure
they're around here somewhere.

99
00:04:58,756 --> 00:04:59,864
Maybe the cleaning lady moved them.

100
00:04:59,982 --> 00:05:01,866
I'm the cleaning lady.

101
00:05:01,943 --> 00:05:03,868
Tell us where you moved them,
or you're fired.

102
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,915
Uh, Mom, you got a new message
from an unknown number.

103
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:12,693
<i>Dear Marge, we have your letters.</i>

104
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,622
<i>If you want to see them again,
pay us $5,000.</i>

105
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,776
<i>If not,
we will show the world what a mean bitch</i>

106
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,720
<i>Marge Simpson really is.</i>

107
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:26,098
Can we say that now?

108
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:32,247
We've got to find that letter thief.

109
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:33,890
Okay. We've got photos

110
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:36,383
of everyone who was at
the party last night.

111
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,570
All our dearest friends and loved ones.

112
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:42,723
One of these scumbags is holding
your mom's letters hostage.

113
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:44,492
But who?

114
00:05:45,561 --> 00:05:47,411
My money's on Jasper.

115
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:50,306
He's ugly,
and ugly people are prone to crime.

116
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:53,492
I've always hated ugly people,
and now I know why.

117
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,753
Guys, last night,
our friends and neighbors

118
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,330
came to show Mom how much they love her.

119
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:01,317
We can't just accuse people willy-nilly.

120
00:06:01,781 --> 00:06:02,860
Willie!

121
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,672
Of course. He was the ugliest
guy at the party by a mile.

122
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:08,674
Let's go burn down his shack.

123
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:12,495
It's not Willie! Willie can't read!

124
00:06:12,513 --> 00:06:14,346
Oh, it's hopeless.

125
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,349
Everyone thinks I'm the
sweetest lady in the world,

126
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:20,427
like Ellen when she
started her talk show.

127
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:23,188
But if those letters get out,
they'll all hate me.

128
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:25,938
Like Ellen when she ended her talk show.

129
00:06:25,973 --> 00:06:28,527
Fear not, Marge. I know who can help us,

130
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:30,454
Springfield's finest.

131
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:31,713
Sorry, can't help you.

132
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:33,291
What? Can't you trace the call

133
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:35,275
or descramble the voice or something?

134
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:39,297
I wish, but the wusses down at
the state house defunded us.

135
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,707
I'm sorry, Marge,
but you're on your own.

136
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:45,694
Uh, we weren't defunded, Chief.

137
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,697
Our budget was increased by 33%.

138
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,366
Yeah, but it's a great excuse

139
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:53,536
for when you want to
have a lazy Saturday.

140
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:58,016
Help. I woke up
in the bathtub with no kidneys.

141
00:06:58,051 --> 00:06:59,117
Defunded.

142
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,544
Oh... Those letters can't get out.

143
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,563
We're just gonna have to pay the ransom.

144
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,231
But it's $5,000.

145
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,792
Do you know how many kidneys
you'd have to steal to get that?

146
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:11,387
I think I know
where we can get the money,

147
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,497
but you're not gonna like it.

148
00:07:15,818 --> 00:07:18,394
Oh, I know
there's always strings attached

149
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,730
with you people,
but there's no one else I can turn to.

150
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,323
Fat Tony...

151
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,510
is currently out of town,
so I came to you.

152
00:07:26,587 --> 00:07:29,572
So, can I borrow the money?

153
00:07:32,334 --> 00:07:35,744
No dice. That's what you get
for repressing your emotions.

154
00:07:35,763 --> 00:07:37,355
You see, Marge,

155
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:40,416
a woman's feelings are
a lot like her boobs.

156
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,418
Always locked away
when they're in public,

157
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,588
but you got to flop
'em out once in a while,

158
00:07:45,606 --> 00:07:47,439
or you'll go bananas.

159
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,617
Ah, at ease, men.

160
00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:53,704
The deadline's almost up.
I don't have the money.

161
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,432
What am I gonna do?

162
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,692
Honey, wait. I've seen every movie

163
00:07:58,694 --> 00:07:59,785
about angry, middle-aged men

164
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:01,729
refusing to negotiate with kidnappers.

165
00:08:01,805 --> 00:08:04,364
I know how to talk to these people.

166
00:08:04,366 --> 00:08:06,609
<i>Time's up, Marge.</i>

167
00:08:06,627 --> 00:08:08,368
This is Mr. Marge, dirt butt,

168
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,537
and you just signed
your own death warrant

169
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:14,617
'cause I'm a retired CIA
ninja who just un-retired

170
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,619
to chimp chomp your face.

171
00:08:16,637 --> 00:08:17,711
<i>Hey. You listen here...</i>

172
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:19,471
No,<i> YOU</i> listen, butt dirt!

173
00:08:19,473 --> 00:08:21,624
We want those letters on our doorstep

174
00:08:21,642 --> 00:08:23,401
by noon hundred hours tomorrow,

175
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:27,387
or I'm gonna be on you
like a Hawaiian shirt on a fat guy.

176
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:30,799
Aloha means "hello" and "you're dead."

177
00:08:31,368 --> 00:08:32,635
Fixed it.

178
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:34,620
Oh...

179
00:08:36,323 --> 00:08:38,323
We haven't heard from
the letter-napper yet.

180
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,309
I put the fear of God in 'em, Marge.

181
00:08:40,327 --> 00:08:43,479
Just like Father Snooze
up there tries to do.

182
00:08:43,497 --> 00:08:45,314
Maybe you did scare them straight,

183
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:47,574
and this whole thing is behind us.

184
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,103
Um, before today's service,

185
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:53,338
Mrs. Lovejoy would like to make a,
um, statement,

186
00:08:53,415 --> 00:08:55,599
uh, she could not be talked out of.

187
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,584
Unless cooler heads have prevailed?

188
00:09:00,426 --> 00:09:01,513
Take it away, dear.

189
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:06,502
Last night, a vile,
horrible letter was left at our doorstep

190
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,353
and tore my world asunder.

191
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,431
It reads, "'Dear'"...
and dear is in quotes... "Helen.

192
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:14,693
"In case you haven't been made aware,
you are a...

193
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,871
bitch!"

194
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,849
"You're a snobby little gossip

195
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,367
"who derives a vampiric pleasure

196
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,296
in the misfortune and
minor foibles of others."

197
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,540
- Wow, you're a good writer, Mom.
- Shh!

198
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:31,302
"Do me a favor and keep your
surgically upturned nose

199
00:09:31,378 --> 00:09:35,547
"out of my business.
Josh Groban would hate your guts.

200
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:37,641
Go jump in a woodchipper."

201
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,477
And it's signed by...

202
00:09:40,357 --> 00:09:44,389
Blank. The name was cut out.

203
00:09:44,391 --> 00:09:47,376
But I know exactly who wrote
this despicable letter.

204
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,562
Someone who's fooled this town for years

205
00:09:50,564 --> 00:09:53,232
with her "sweet, gentle" nature.

206
00:09:53,308 --> 00:09:54,850
Agnes Skinner.

207
00:09:55,527 --> 00:09:58,478
I would never write such vile things.

208
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,391
I'd say 'em to your discount Botox face.

209
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,743
Are you gonna let her
talk to me like that?

210
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:06,504
Defend my honor.

211
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:07,730
Get him, Seymour.

212
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,249
But-but-but he's a man of God.

213
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,417
Shouldn't I turn the other cheek?

214
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,677
Wuss fight!

215
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:15,346
Fight! Fight!

216
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,405
Fight!

217
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:21,851
<i>Look at the mayhem</i>

218
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:24,463
<i>that just one of your letters can cause.</i>

219
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,874
<i>You have 60 minutes
before I release them all</i>

220
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,936
<i>and turn your life into
an abominable hellscape</i>

221
00:10:30,938 --> 00:10:33,772
<i>of torment and woe.</i>

222
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:36,550
Honey, you're missing the wuss fight.
What's going on?

223
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:39,970
I know just who the kidnapper is.

224
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,890
_

225
00:10:44,202 --> 00:10:47,710
More crab puffs coming right up.

226
00:10:48,227 --> 00:10:50,972
Hey, Shauna.
Thanks again for babysitting.

227
00:10:50,974 --> 00:10:53,716
I'm sorry I forgot to
mention it was 56 kids

228
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:56,645
instead of the usual three. How is it?

229
00:10:56,721 --> 00:11:01,057
Ugh. It's an abominable
hellscape of torment and woe.

230
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:02,068
Wha...?

231
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,636
Oh. I'm reading a goth romance novel

232
00:11:04,655 --> 00:11:06,079
and some of the vocab is sticking.

233
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:07,973
- _
- Hmm.

234
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:09,824
- Ooh, crab puffs.
- Up-bup-bup.

235
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:13,645
Why don't you eat the food
I left in the kids area?

236
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:16,648
But Milhouse sucked all the
pigs out of the blankets.

237
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,741
And Martin ate all
the corn off the dogs.

238
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:22,304
Oh, I'm sure it's not that bad.
Who wants crab puffs?

239
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:24,005
_

240
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:27,842
Ugh. Every time she hires me to babysit,

241
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:30,679
she treats me like I freakin'
work for her.

242
00:11:30,831 --> 00:11:32,681
She acts like all I do around here

243
00:11:32,683 --> 00:11:35,167
is watch TV and try on her clothes.

244
00:11:35,185 --> 00:11:37,760
<i>Uh, that is what you do.</i>

245
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,947
Yikes. How does she pull this off

246
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:41,690
without looking like a skank?

247
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:44,025
<i>The pearls class the whole thing up.</i>

248
00:11:44,178 --> 00:11:46,695
Psh. Everyone thinks she's such a saint.

249
00:11:46,697 --> 00:11:49,623
Meanwhile,
she's starving the one babysitter

250
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,108
that's watching, like,
every kid in town.

251
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,035
<i>Where are those kids, anyway?</i>

252
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:56,004
Up your butt. I don't know.

253
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:01,617
Holy crab.

254
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:05,714
Oh, man. This angry MILF
hates everyone in town.

255
00:12:05,866 --> 00:12:07,957
I thought this box
was gonna be full of, like,

256
00:12:08,035 --> 00:12:09,701
pot or grandma ashes,

257
00:12:09,703 --> 00:12:10,869
but this is even better.

258
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:13,647
I bet Mrs. Bart's Mom would pay anything

259
00:12:13,724 --> 00:12:15,983
to keep people from
reading these letters.

260
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:18,727
Even $5,000.

261
00:12:19,561 --> 00:12:21,896
With that kind of money,
we could start over.

262
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:23,898

00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:42,158
Marge Simpson's gonna rue the day

273
00:12:42,236 --> 00:12:43,902
she ever messed with me.

274
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,956
Shauna Chalmers is gonna rue
the day she ever messed with me.

275
00:12:53,427 --> 00:12:54,980
<i>...an abominable hellscape</i>

276
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:57,432
<i>of torment and woe!</i>

277
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:01,436
Shauna said that exact same
phrase the night of the party.

278
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:04,680
So, she and the raccoon
are working together.

279
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,200
They probably stole our garbage, too.
So what's the plan?

280
00:13:07,277 --> 00:13:10,686
I know that, on Sundays,
Shauna volunteers at the senior home

281
00:13:10,764 --> 00:13:14,541
to steal their medications,
so this is the perfect time

282
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,544
to break into her house
and get those letters back.

283
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,379
You want to break into her house?

284
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:22,532
What would Marge say? You're Marge.

285
00:13:22,609 --> 00:13:23,866
Damn it.

286
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:26,611
Superintendent Chalmers is home.

287
00:13:26,613 --> 00:13:29,781
We're gonna have to improvise.

288
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,618
Oh, hello, Mrs. Simpson.

289
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,563
To what do I owe the
unannounced weekend visit?

290
00:13:36,714 --> 00:13:39,399
Um... I'm writing an article

291
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:42,627
for the PTA newsletter about you.

292
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:43,638
Me?

293
00:13:43,647 --> 00:13:46,631
Yes. An interview, really. Long form.

294
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:50,468
"Gary Chalmers:
A Profile In Competence."

295
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,705
Not "incompetence." "In competence."

296
00:13:55,325 --> 00:13:56,641
'Cause you're great.

297
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:01,571
Hm... I wasn't aware that
the PTA's biannual, one-page,

298
00:14:01,648 --> 00:14:03,573
single-sided newsletter

299
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,576
even did long-form interviews,

300
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:08,503
but how nice. Come on in.

301
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,673
Uh, don't you need a pen
or a recording device?

302
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:15,493
Uh, no.
No, I have a photographic memory.

303
00:14:15,512 --> 00:14:17,604
For auditory speech?

304
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:18,847
Yes.

305
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:20,590
<i>I think he's buying it.</i>

306
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:22,592
<i>I'm not buying it.</i>

307
00:14:22,594 --> 00:14:24,836
<i>But why make up such an absurd story?</i>

308
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:26,596
<i>Oh, dear God,</i>

309
00:14:26,673 --> 00:14:28,931
<i>Marge Simpson is coming on to me.</i>

310
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:31,843
So, how did you become so...

311
00:14:31,845 --> 00:14:34,362
super at... intending?

312
00:14:34,514 --> 00:14:37,515
<i>Well, I can't say the
thought hasn't crossed my mind.</i>

313
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:40,062
<i>No, Gary.
Not with another school parent.</i>

314
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:42,778
<i>The Van Houten woman is
still blowing up your phone.</i>

315
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,540
<i>I have to put an end to this right now.</i>

316
00:14:45,617 --> 00:14:47,450
Look, I'm very sorry, Mrs. Simpson,

317
00:14:47,527 --> 00:14:49,711
but I'm gonna have to ask you...

318
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:53,531
if you would like some plum wine.

319
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:56,626
Come on, Homer. Rummage like the wind.

320
00:14:57,133 --> 00:15:00,288
Psh. Another stupid kid
wearing an old T-shirt

321
00:15:00,323 --> 00:15:02,033
of a band they know nothing about.

322
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,467
I bet she can't name one song by...

323
00:15:04,544 --> 00:15:05,902
Planned Parenthood.

324
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:09,004
Got it.

325
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:14,844
Oh, if there's
a lovelier music than samba,

326
00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:16,496
I don't want to hear it.

327
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:19,482
Have you ever been to Brazil?

328
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:21,484
Very liberated country.

329
00:15:22,516 --> 00:15:23,670
You don't say.

330
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,322
<i>Que diabos!</i> What was that?

331
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:28,408
Just the house settling, I bet.

332
00:15:28,443 --> 00:15:31,661
With this framing? Not likely.
I better go check it out.

333
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:38,693
Uh, I think I have enough
for my article, Superintendent.

334
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:40,520
Thanks again for your time.

335
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,464
But-but I-I...

336
00:15:44,124 --> 00:15:45,817
It's probably for the best.

337
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:50,739
- _
- _

338
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:52,699
We did it!

339
00:15:52,776 --> 00:15:56,611
Sorry, Shauna Chalmers.
"Letter" luck next time.

340
00:15:56,688 --> 00:15:59,748
What the...? Goth romance novels?

341
00:16:00,617 --> 00:16:02,692
She took the letters out.

342
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:07,004
Oh, it's hopeless.

343
00:16:07,106 --> 00:16:10,107
Shauna's probably spreading
them all over town by now.

344
00:16:10,109 --> 00:16:14,111
Everyone's gonna know what a
terrible person I am inside.

345
00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:18,373
What the...?

346
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:20,284
My letters.

347
00:16:20,286 --> 00:16:22,311
Step on it, Jimbo.

348
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:32,146
Marge, what are you... Ah!

349
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:41,109
_

350
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,085
Give me back my letters.

351
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:52,341
Go get her, Marge. I've got this punk.

352
00:16:54,988 --> 00:16:56,411
I don't got this punk.

353
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:11,002
Stop right there.

354
00:17:11,004 --> 00:17:13,004
Come any closer, and I'll, like-like,

355
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:14,280
drop 'em or whatever.

356
00:17:14,282 --> 00:17:16,007
Why'd you do it, Shauna?

357
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:18,267
Was all this over a stupid crab puff?

358
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:22,013
No. When I found those letters,
I thought they were awesome.

359
00:17:22,031 --> 00:17:25,107
You totally nailed all the
cringe-os in this cringe town.

360
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:28,019
And then I read the
letter you wrote to me.

361
00:17:28,037 --> 00:17:30,204
Oh, Shauna. I never meant for you...

362
00:17:30,206 --> 00:17:33,024
You called me a "hormonal little snot

363
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:35,134
with more piercings than brains."

364
00:17:35,136 --> 00:17:37,970
And you're supposed to be
the nicest lady in town?

365
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,381
I am nice. I just write these letters

366
00:17:40,457 --> 00:17:42,049
when I'm filled with anger.

367
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:45,144
And then, afterwards, I'm over it.
I swear.

368
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:48,055
There's, like,
30-year-old letters in here.

369
00:17:48,057 --> 00:17:50,391
If you're so over it,
why'd you save 'em?

370
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:52,968
Because...

371
00:17:52,987 --> 00:17:54,970
...it brings me peace.

372
00:17:54,989 --> 00:17:56,063
Give me my letters.

373
00:17:57,636 --> 00:17:58,666
Shauna!

374
00:18:01,145 --> 00:18:02,311
Don't let me die.

375
00:18:02,388 --> 00:18:05,072
I want to live to be
old and fat like you.

376
00:18:05,224 --> 00:18:08,150
I can save you both.

377
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:09,326
No!

378
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:12,213
I got you, Shauna.

379
00:18:14,008 --> 00:18:17,176
Thanks Mrs. S. I'm really sorry.

380
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:20,087
I know, sweetie.

381
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:22,089
Well, they're all out there now.

382
00:18:22,241 --> 00:18:25,409
All my unspoken
grievances and resentments

383
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:27,078
for the world to read.

384
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,413
Hey, look. A letter from Marge Simpson,

385
00:18:29,415 --> 00:18:31,023
addressed directly to me.

386
00:18:31,025 --> 00:18:34,026
"Dear Chief, you give fat, do-nothing,

387
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:37,088
donut-eating cops a bad name."

388
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,031
"A soulless dead-eyed creepazoid."

389
00:18:39,183 --> 00:18:42,093
"A greasy-fingered know-it-all."

390
00:18:42,095 --> 00:18:45,204
"An amoral homewrecker
and a never-was singer."

391
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:49,041
"A deviant letch who can't keep
his busy hands to himself."

392
00:18:49,193 --> 00:18:51,878
"A smoking hot comedic linchpin

393
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,196
who should've never left Studio 8H."

394
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:59,034
There's the hateful
epistolist who called me

395
00:18:59,112 --> 00:19:03,347
"an operatic blowhard."

396
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:11,122
Hi, everyone. I just want to apologize.

397
00:19:11,124 --> 00:19:13,065
Not for having negative feelings,

398
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:16,127
but for keeping them
to myself all these years.

399
00:19:16,145 --> 00:19:18,237
Even though I smiled in your face,

400
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:20,131
I was secretly furious.

401
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:23,242
And that wasn't fair to you or to me.

402
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:26,078
So do you hate us all?

403
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,973
No. No, I love the people of this town.

404
00:19:28,975 --> 00:19:30,399
Even when we butt heads.

405
00:19:31,566 --> 00:19:33,085
Butt heads.

406
00:19:33,162 --> 00:19:34,495
Aw.

407
00:19:34,497 --> 00:19:37,406
But I'd rather you all think
of me as an honest person

408
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:40,075
with real, complex emotions,

409
00:19:40,077 --> 00:19:43,320
and not someone who's just nice.

410
00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:46,173
- Thank you.
- Let's hear it for Marge Simpson.

411
00:19:46,175 --> 00:19:49,251
The most three-dimensional
woman in town.

412
00:19:54,925 --> 00:19:56,350
Helen, hi.

413
00:19:56,502 --> 00:20:00,004
Marge, I know it was you who
wrote me that scornful letter,

414
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:02,006
and I just wanted to say...

415
00:20:02,008 --> 00:20:05,934
I'm sorry for being so snarky
and elitist in the past.

416
00:20:06,012 --> 00:20:09,104
Oh. Why, thank you. Apology accept...

417
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:12,107
As someone so well
off and closer to God,

418
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:16,278
it's easy for me to look down my
naturally perfect nose at you.

419
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,946
But that ends now.

420
00:20:17,948 --> 00:20:19,448
Oh, I'm glad to hear it.

421
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,950
Ugh. I envy this new you, Marge.

422
00:20:22,028 --> 00:20:24,195
Honest and boorishly uncouth.

423
00:20:24,197 --> 00:20:25,212
Right.

424
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:27,139
Anyway, I'm off to the good hairdresser.

425
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:31,310
Oh, not the one you're thinking of,
this one's better. Toodles.

426
00:20:31,723 --> 00:20:34,221
Oh, wait, wait. O-One more thing, Helen.

427
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:35,389
Yes?

428
00:20:35,391 --> 00:20:38,317
Kiss my ass!

429
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,442
<i>"Dear Marge,
where the hell do you get off?</i>

430
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:56,528
<i>"My career choices are nobody's business</i>

431
00:20:56,611 --> 00:20:58,820
<i>"but mine and maybe my manager's.</i>

432
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:00,172
<i>"The next time you want to tell me</i>

433
00:21:00,174 --> 00:21:02,733
<i>"what other
'bone-headed mistakes' I've made,</i>

434
00:21:02,735 --> 00:21:03,917
<i>"I hope you'll do me a favor</i>

435
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,827
<i>"and go jump in a wood chipper.</i>

436
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:09,831
<i>Sincerely yours, Tim Meadows."</i>

437
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,976
Wow. That does feel good.

438
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:16,930
<i>"Dear Lorne Michaels,
where the hell do you get off?"</i>

439
00:21:16,932 --> 00:21:22,511
<i>"Dear TGI Fridays,
where the hell do you get off?"</i>

440
00:21:23,514 --> 00:21:26,532
<i>"Dear Sunglass Hut,
where the hell do you get off?"</i>

441
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:31,111
<i>"Dear Quiznos,
where the hell do you get off?"</i>

442
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,081
- Shh!
<i>- Where the hell do you get off?</i>

443
