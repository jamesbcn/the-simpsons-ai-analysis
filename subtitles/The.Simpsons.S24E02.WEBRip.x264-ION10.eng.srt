1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:03,378
(screeches, whistles)

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,880
(shouting gibberish)

3
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,716
According to our Mayan calendar,

4
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,515
the world will be destroyed

5
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,888
at the end of the 13th baktun.

6
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:21,976
Unless we appease the gods'
anger with a human sacrifice.

7
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:25,033
Don't worry. We got a guy here
we really been fattening up.

8
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,318
Is it you?

9
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,901
Not me. That guy.

10
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,696
More cricket fajitas!

11
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,909
Oh, my brave, brave glutton.

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,870
I'll be so lonely when they
sacrifice you to the gods.

13
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,122
What?!

14
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,084
No one said anything about a sacrifice!

15
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,375
Although I... I did kind of
space out during orientation.

16
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,210
All right already, let's get this done

17
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,705
while our doomed civilization
is still flourishing here.

18
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,717
Oh. Any words of comfort?

19
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,929
Oh, yeah, sure.
Even though you know it's coming,

20
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,720
when you see your own beating heart,

21
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,103
try to act surprised, huh?

22
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,560
It's some kid's first time.

23
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,059
Fear not, my beloved blood offering.

24
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,892
(quietly) I have a plan.

25
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,937
Tell me, High Priest,

26
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,151
are you interested in women?

27
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,481
What priest isn't?

28
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,026
Before we make love,

29
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,399
would you mind
putting a sack over your head?

30
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,737
Is there any other way?
(chuckles)

31
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,242
Nice and tight.

32
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,744
-Now enter the Room of Pleasure.
-Ooh.

33
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,616
And I shall join you shortly.

34
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,076
Now, uh, I got to warn you.
I'm into rough stuff.

35
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,496
Ooh, that's a good start,
but, you know, make it hurt.

36
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,375
-(sword whooshes)
-Heh. Ooh!

37
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,172
That whooshing sound
is really turning me...

38
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,264
Oh!

39
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,262
Uh. Oh, yeah. Ah.

40
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,144
(grunting)

41
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,101
(groans)

42
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,101
(kids laughing)

43
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,523
Man, soccer's even boring for the ball.

44
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,152
Quetzal H. Coatl!

45
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,689
We sacrificed the wrong person!

46
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,282
Now the earth will be destroyed
after the 13th baktun.

47
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,199
Could you explain
that in simple Ancient Mayan?!

48
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,608
Of course.
There's no need to shout and scream.

49
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,487
Let's see, uh, converting to base 10,

50
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,035
assuming for the birth of Jesus,

51
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,120
invent and then carry the leap year,

52
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,786
and the world will end in 2012!

53
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,286
(relieved sighs)

54
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,668
And it will be Obama's fault!

55
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,634
(dramatic theme plays)

56
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,096
Hey, uh, Marge, I'm setting my watch.

57
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,509
What baktun is it?

58
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,137
-13th!
-Oh!

59
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,934
(doorbell rings)

60
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,558
Oh! What have we here?

61
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,015
Ow!

62
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,028
What the hell?

63
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:04,183
(Homer screaming and crying)

64
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,347
Ow! Ow!

65
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,823
{\an8}(letters thudding softly)

66
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,612
{\an8}(yelling)

67
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,989
{\an8}Welcome to the grand
opening of our whatchamacallit,

68
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:24,035
{\an8}which, thanks to the lobbying
of Lisa Simpson,

69
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,330
{\an8}we built instead
of a new baseball stadium.

70
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,294
{\an8}At least the pennant works both ways.

71
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:32,214
{\an8}Professor Frink will now throw
a switch, which will either

72
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,835
{\an8}answer certain obscure
questions of subatomic physics

73
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,304
{\an8}or destroy the universe.

74
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,434
{\an8}(electrical humming)

75
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,770
{\an8}(man coughs)

76
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,519
{\an8}Oh, my God particle!

77
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,103
{\an8}What is it, Professor?

78
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,818
{\an8}You can tell your
grandchildren you were here

79
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,939
{\an8}when humanity finally learned
that this accelerator

80
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,027
{\an8}is much too small
to tell us anything important.

81
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,362
{\an8}(crowd groans)

82
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,117
{\an8}Thanks a lot, Liser!

83
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,949
{\an8}That money could've been used for a war!

84
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,865
{\an8}(whirring)

85
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:12,086
{\an8}(whirring growing more high-pitched)

86
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,748
{\an8}(crashing)

87
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,879
{\an8}(crackling)

00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,008
{\an8}(slurping)

00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,676
{\an8}(snores)

90
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,894
{\an8}(gasping)

91
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,274
{\an8}Aah! No one takes Willie's mop!

92
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,561
{\an8}(gasping)

93
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,314
{\an8}Take the mop! Take the mop!

94
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,227
{\an8}(sobbing)

95
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,435
{\an8}Huh?

96
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,645
{\an8}(slurping)

97
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,744
{\an8}(gasps) A mini black hole!

00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,150
{\an8}(slurps)

99
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,488
{\an8}Whee...!

100
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,993
{\an8}Oh, no! I got to take it away

101
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,576
{\an8}before more clueless kids fall into it.

102
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,411
{\an8}Geronimo! Wha...!

103
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,296
{\an8}(whooshing)

104
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,972
{\an8}-I's rich!
-(slurping)

105
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,181
{\an8}I's poor and shack-less.

106
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,682
{\an8}(slurping, objects clattering)

107
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,774
{\an8}(grunting)

108
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,350
{\an8}Lisa, do you have a stray dog down there?

109
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,266
{\an8}Um, it's a lot worse than a stray dog.

110
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,685
{\an8}Two stray dogs?!

111
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,363
{\an8}It's a black hole!

112
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,032
{\an8}That was gonna be my next guess.

113
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,860
{\an8}Are you sure your next guess
wasn't three stray dogs?

114
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,156
{\an8}Maybe.

115
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,289
{\an8}A black hole?!
I'm sorry, can we call it that?

116
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,119
{\an8}Yes. It's the preferred term.

117
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,964
{\an8}And most scientists believe
that what enters a black hole

118
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,131
{\an8}never comes out.

119
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,878
{\an8}But some think they may be
a gateway to other universes.

120
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,712
{\an8}Hey! Could it open a pretzel bag for me?

121
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,177
{\an8}Help a brother out, B.H. Whoo-hoo!

122
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,048
{\an8}D'oh!

123
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,471
{\an8}Guys! Stop throwing things in the hole!

124
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,977
{\an8}The more you throw in, the bigger
and more dangerous it becomes!

125
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,441
{\an8}Come on. You can't look at that
infinitely dense little guy

126
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,612
{\an8}and not want to feed it something.

127
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,111
{\an8}Dad, don't pat it!

128
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,403
{\an8}-Why shouldn't... (screams)
-(chuckles)

129
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,027
{\an8}Why you little... (grunting)

130
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:08,084
{\an8}(gasps) I'm nature's perfect
choking machine!

131
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,159
{\an8}Okay, that's it!

132
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,794
{\an8}I'm putting a baby gate
across the black hole.

133
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,792
{\an8}And don't throw anything more into it!

134
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,955
{\an8}(groans) Yes, Homer?

135
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,464
{\an8}Dad, that's creepy.

136
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,005
{\an8}Sorry.

00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,466

Does anybody want to admit
to throwing things in?

152
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,854
-No.
-Not me.

153
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,179
Do we even still have that thing?

has anyone seen the cat?

Stop! This is a black hole,
not a lawn-and-leaf bag!

it could reach critical mass.

00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,223
(grunting)

178
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,971
(screaming)

179
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,727
(suckling)

180
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,601
(debris clattering)

181
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,317
(suckling)

182
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,525
(all yelling)

183
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,896
(gasping)

184
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,487
(grunting)

185
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,822
Welcome, trans-dimensional visitors.

186
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:58,288
We have received
your many gifts with gratitude.

187
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,081
NELSON: Haw-haw!

188
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,584
We have built our society around
the treasures you have sent.

189
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,708
Our most popular magazine is

190
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,255
your Presidents' Day
Mattress Blowout insert.

191
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,217
Our favorite food is your banana peel.

192
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,761
(slurps)

193
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,684
And we listen to all our music

194
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,353
on the most wonderful device
ever created,

195
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,062
the Zune.

196
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,692
(chanting) Zune, Zune, Zune.

197
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,360
Treasures? Gifts?
You've got it all wrong.

198
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,899
That stuff is just our old...

199
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,783
-Wonderful stuff. Enjoy it.
-ALIENS: Zune.

200
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,869
(dramatic theme plays)

201
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:41,161
{\an8}Day 1: We bought this camera
because strange things

202
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,787
{\an8}have been going on at our house
in the dead of night.

203
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:51,133
And if anyone finds this footage
after we're all missing or dead,

204
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,255
remember me as a hero.

205
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,852
Dad, you forgot to pick me up
after Little League.

206
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,388
You tossed your car keys in my bean plant.

207
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,892
A hero!

208
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,064
-FLANDERS: Homer, is that my camera?
-Hero, away!

209
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,811
{\an8}Night 1.

210
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,192
Want to snuggle? (smooching)

211
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,696
-Not with the camera on.
-Uh, I turned it off.

212
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,449
Looks like the red light's on.

213
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,161
I swear I am not filming!

214
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,412
(whispering loudly)
Note to self-- edit out my lies.

215
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,455
Oh!

216
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,168
(tape fast-forwarding)

217
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,763
(door creaks)

218
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,343
(door creaks)

219
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,465
(loud thumping)

220
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,643
(tape fast-forwarding)

221
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,312
-(loud thud downstairs)
-(whimpering)

222
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,567
(both yelp)

223
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,359
Wait!
Don't kill the monster without me!

224
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,322
(Marge screams)

225
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,742
HOMER: I'm right behind you,
honey! We have stairs?

226
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,621
Ow! D'oh! Aah! D'oh!

227
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,948
(continues grunting)

228
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,743
What the...? Ow! Ooh! Ow! Ooh!

229
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,996
(continues grunting)

230
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,371
(flames crackling)

231
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,127
HOMER: What the...?

232
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,249
(gasping breaths)

233
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,586
Why is this happening to us?!

234
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,552
I don't know, I don't know!
I'm sure I don't know!

235
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,263
HOMER: Oh, sweetie.

236
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,433
Sometimes a mysterious,
invisible being from Hell

237
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,433
waits for a family to go to sleep,
then kills them.

238
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,806
-Now, go to bed.
-But...

239
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,852
{\an8}Uh-uh. School night.

240
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,016
{\an8}Now, you're sure I bought enough cameras

241
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,355
{\an8}and extended warranties
to catch that ghost?

242
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,110
{\an8}Sir, whatever happens in this house,
these cameras will pick it up.

243
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,863
Ooh, I can't wait for tonight's massacre.

244
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,499
(tape fast-forwarding)

245
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,336
-Hey, Marge.
-Mmm...

246
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,554
Oh. Like what you see, huh?

247
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,184
Mmm...

248
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,391
I like it when you don't say words.

249
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,181
-Come here, you.
-Mmm...

250
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,845
-(chuckles)
-Mmm...

251
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:10,024
{\an8}(singing a melody)

252
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,274
{\an8}(tape fast-forwarding)

253
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,935
{\an8}(continues singing melody)

254
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,662
{\an8}(tape fast-forwarding)

255
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,953
{\an8}(continues singing melody)

256
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,042
Eh, eh.

257
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,044
Yeah, that's hellfire, all right.

258
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,626
Someone in this family
has made a deal with the devil,

259
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,802
and now the devil wants his due.

260
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,261
Now, remember, this creature
feeds on your fear...

261
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,511
-(cuckoo clock chimes)
-What the hell was that?!

262
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,434
(sobbing loudly)

263
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,722
Actually,
he feeds on more than just fear.

264
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,227
{\an8}(door creaks)

265
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,272
{\an8}(wind whistling)

266
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,203
Give back my baby!

267
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,032
DEMON: We had a deal!

268
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,947
Mom, what's going on?!

269
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,786
DEMON: Don't act so surprised, Marge.

270
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,331
You knew this day was coming!

271
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,044
Let's see what we're dealing with here.

272
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,424
(grunts)

273
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,131
It's Moe with wings!

274
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,001
Moe Szyslak?

275
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,587
Come on, he's much more
hideous and evil than me!

276
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,093
(all agreeing)

277
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:24,255
(crying)
I brought this on us all.

278
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,845
It began when I was a girl...

279
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,558
(deep grunting)

280
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,185
BOTH: Hail Satan.

281
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,611
-What are you doing?
-Trying to summon the devil.

282
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,280
-Why?
-Nothing good on TV.

283
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,859
We have no boyfriends.

284
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,704
-We're bored.
-Something to do.

285
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,989
Hail Satan, the Minister of Sinister,

286
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,084
Rude Dude with a Bad 'Tude.

287
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,998
(grunting, choking)

288
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,920
(gasps) Save us, Marge.

289
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,288
We'll never make fun
of any man you date or marry.

290
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,416
-Mmm. Uh, Mr. Demon?
-Mmm?

291
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,053
Could you... come back
for my sisters later?

292
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,420
(Selma and Patty grunting)

293
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,677
Very well. You have 30 years.

294
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,509
But when I return, Marge,

295
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,894
I shall take your favorite child.

296
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,852
I thought I was the favorite!

297
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,441
Not the favorite! Not the favorite!

298
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,439
Listen, pal,
you seem like an honest guy.

299
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,072
Is there any other deal
that you can accept?

300
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,607
Three-way.

301
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,744
Hmm. You, me and Marge?

302
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,611
Mmm, demon, demon, you.

303
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,328
(heavy sigh) I guess it's one of those
things a dad has to do.

304
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,040
Now, before we start,
what's the safe word?

305
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,161
Cinnamon.

306
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,667
Ooh, I like that.

307
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,458
Now, I'd like to try something
new, if you don't mind.

308
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,133
DEMON: Cinnamon. Cinnamon.
Cinnamon! Cinnamon!

309
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,428
You know, it's really not fair.

310
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:52,853
You're charging 200 bucks for a comic
that says 25 cents on the cover.

311
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,353
The only way to buy that
comic book for 25 cents

312
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,436
is to go back to 1974.

313
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,271
That's impossible! Mmm?

314
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,357
(quietly) Or <i>is</i> it?

315
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,072
(zapping)

316
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,905
Wow, it worked!

317
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,294
My time machine has worked!

318
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,620
This is the most fantastically
powerful invention

319
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,497
in mankind's history!

320
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,384
Here, kid, hold my keys
while I grab some lunch.

321
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,712
(humming)

322
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,141
(whirring)

323
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,969
(zapping)

324
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,055
♪♪

325
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,855
1974!

326
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,864
I won't be needing this!

327
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,660
(zapping)

328
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,663
Now to get my comic book
and explore a world

329
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,787
where no one's mad at George Lucas.

330
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,964
(humming happily)

331
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,463
Eh, pretty good. A little preachy.

332
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,215
MAN: Well, well, well,
if it isn't Homer Simpson

333
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,468
-and Barney Gumble.
-Hmm?

334
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,050
Allow me, gentlemen.

335
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,310
It's Homer!
Before his boobs came in!

336
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,766
(Homer whistling)

337
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,403
-Hey, Homer.
-Who are you?

338
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,650
I'm your unwanted son from the future
who killed all your fun!

339
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,493
Why, you little... (grunting)

340
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,609
Excuse me. Is this room 106?

341
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:34,368
(instrumental version
of "Close to You" playing)

342
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,201
(choking)

343
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,956
Let go of him!

344
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,288
What kind of jerk
strangles a little boy?!

345
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,044
Would you go to the prom with me?

346
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,996
Promenade? With you?

347
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,046
Forget it, bub! (grunts)

348
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,553
It was love at first sight,
and you ruined it!

349
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,644
It was not love at first sight!

350
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,560
-What do you know?
-I know who I'm in love with!

351
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,309
-You're looking at him.
-You're an idiot.

352
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,141
-You're the idiot!
-(gasps)

353
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,806
Don't act like I'm the first person
that ever said that.

354
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,305
You are the first person
who ever said that!

355
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,028
Shut up and go to the prom with me!

356
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,898
<i>Ay, caramba!</i> If you guys
don't get together,

357
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,985
what does that mean for me in the future?

358
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:14,781
(gasps) I don't exist?!

359
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:19,287
Or my life might be
a hell of a lot better!

360
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,291
Ma'am, whatever you do,
do not marry that ape.

361
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,134
Mmm.

362
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,300
Whatever you say, little boy.

363
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,630
-(laughing)
-(growling) Come here!

364
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,797
Now, to return to a future
where I'm either rich

365
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,807
or allowed to stand in front
of a rich guy's house.

366
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,809
Either way, better than now.

367
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,811
(whirring)

368
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,904
(tires screeching, zapping)

369
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,149
(Bart laughing)

370
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,782
Stupid kid steals my future.

371
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,110
Well, I'm going to...

372
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,315
(gasps)
Ice cream with cookie dough?!

373
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,076
Unnecessarily big TVs!

374
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,499
Thursday Night Football?

375
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,328
And the globe feels so warm!

376
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,134
I am in awe of the future.

377
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,669
(Wiggum snoring, muttering)

378
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,424
Okay, that's not so great.

379
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,841
Here's your smoothie, sweetheart.

380
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,848
Why would I suck smoothie
when I can suck face with you,

381
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,682
Mrs. Artie Ziff?

382
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,187
(both moaning)

383
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,400
My dad is Artie Ziff?

384
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,861
Indeed! Which makes you

385
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,192
Barty Ziff.

386
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,743
<i>Oy, caramba!</i>

387
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,952
Achem!

388
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,952
Good morning, beloved son.

389
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,164
Enjoy your luxurious life,

390
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,495
including your own bully butler.

391
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,960
Will that be haw-haw, sir?

392
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,381
Give yourself a wedgie.

393
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,249
Excellent choice. (grunts)

394
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,967
I've met some jive turkeys in the '70s,

395
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,628
but that turkey's the jivest.

396
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,796
Hey, you! This is my peeping tree.

397
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,095
Young me?
What brings you to the present?

398
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,719
I traveled through space and time
to make Marge settle for me

399
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,267
because she doesn't know better.

400
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,390
Well, if we put our heads together,

401
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,267
we could think of a plan!

402
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,227
I got to ask, what happened?

403
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,066
Was I in a forest fire or something?

404
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,953
No!

405
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,989
-(whip cracking)
-I love my life, I love it not.

406
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,583
I love my life, I love it not.

407
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,118
You're just like Indiana Jones, son.

408
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,872
A role played by Richard Dreyfuss
in our universe.

409
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,075
(doorbell rings)

410
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,077
I'm here to take my life back!

411
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,338
I thought this might happen,

412
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,090
so I mastered Brazilian jujitsu.

413
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,764
Crawl atop me, and meet your doom!

414
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,513
Not so fast.

415
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,635
Say hello to the United Federation

416
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,522
of Homers Through History.

417
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,347
(Italian accent) Crush them...

418
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,727
in the name of Jebus!

419
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,664
Okay, guys, let's regroup.

420
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,409
We'll come back with more Homers
and start fresh in the morning.

421
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,831
(yelps)

422
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,919
("Close to You" plays)

423
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,504
Oh, what's she doing here?

424
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,917
I'll tell you what I'm doing.

425
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:18,715
I'm realizing that
I married the wrong man.

426
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,930
Oh, you poor, sweet, simple Homers.

427
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,473
I was supposed to be with all of you!

428
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,387
(grunting gibberish)

429
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,307
Even you, Caveman Homer.

430
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,765
That's Renaissance Homer.

431
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,565
Well, cardinal or cannibal,

432
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:37,319
I wish that 20 years ago,
I had chosen love.

433
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,652
Mmm...

434
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,954
Let me get this straight.

435
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:45,042
None of you had time
to take out the garbage?

436
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,038
Make Egyptian Slave Homer do it.

437
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,410
It's always me.

438
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,578
(all laughing)

439
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,207
(Homer screams)

440
