team there, Liser.

177
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,211
(sheepish chuckling)

178
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,340
"...my soul smells like a dead
pigeon after three weeks.

179
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,668
I shut my window
and go to sleep.

180
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,264
In my dream I eat corn
with my eyes."

181
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,638
Philistines.

182
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,520
Lisa, I’m sorry you
got a bad grade on
your "Moe and tell."

183
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,401
I don’t care about my grade.

184
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,818
I’m gonna send Moe’s poem to
<i>American Poetry Perspectives.</i>

185
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,278
Do not mention that
publication in this house!

186
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,029
They never published
my poem!

187
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,862
"There once was
a rapping tomato

188
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,987
That’s right,
I said ’rapping tomato’

189
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,414
He rapped all day
from April to May

190
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,753
And also, guess what,
it was me."

191
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,909
(grunts)

192
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,916
Hey, Chief, we just
got a submission

193
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,625
from a brilliant poet
no one’s ever heard of!

194
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,465
(grunting)

195
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,141
Hmm!
Genius!

196
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,889
Pay him nothing,
and run it on the cover!

197
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,511
Stop the presses!
Send my wife some flowers!

198
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,598
And bring me an Advil!
What do you mean
you don’t work for me?!

199
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,773
You’re hired!
Now that you’re hired,
you’re fired!

200
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,141
Now that you don’t work here,
we can be friends.

201
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,727
Now that we’re friends,
how come you never call?

202
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,562
Some friend you are!
God, I love this business.

203
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,567
Here it is.

204
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,441
Bad news, Maya Angelou:
you’ve been bumped.

205
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,567
<i>(indistinct yelling)</i>
<i>...you can’t bump me...</i>
<i>...bump you!</i>

206
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,235
(indistinct yelling)

207
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,412
Moe,
you’re a published author!

208
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,405
Wow, Just think:
earlier tonight,

209
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,327
a newly-published poet
cleaned up my barf.

210
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,587
(phone rings)

211
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,378
Moe’s Tavern.
Who?

212
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,462
Where?
To what?

213
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,127
Screw you, snail trail!

214
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,545
Who was that?

215
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,474
Eh, some jerk makin’
a prank call

216
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,262
with a gag name:
"Tom Wolfe."

217
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,846
Tom Wolfe?!

218
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,060
He wrote <i>The Right Stuff</i>
and <i>Bonfire of the Vanities.</i>

219
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,733
And coined the phrase
"radical chic!" (groans)

220
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,273
Wait, wait, wait. Then that
guy wasn’t squeezin’ my ’roids

221
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,358
when he invited me to the
Wordloaf Festival in Vermont?

222
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,914
(gasps)
The Wordloaf Festival?!

223
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,278
You’ll meet all the great
American writers, Moe!

224
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,776
You have to go!

225
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,907
Yeah? Well, okay, all right,
but uh... only if you come, huh?

226
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,405
Ah, I wouldn’t-a had none
of this without you, kid.

227
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,208
(phone rings)

228
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,092
Hello.
Oh, hey, Milhouse.

229
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:10,999
I’m not here.

230
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:18,338
Ah, a family trip with
the family bartender--
what could be better?

231
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,260
How’s it goin’, Homer?

232
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,927
Oh, lousy.

233
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,015
I gotta go to Vermont
for some stupid poetry thing.

234
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,692
Homer, don’t
drink and drive!

235
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,071
Fine.
I’ll drive between sips.

236
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,109
(tires screech)

237
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,110
(tires screech)

238
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,702
(tires screech)

239
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,201
(slurps)

240
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,162
(tires screech)

241
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,412
(slurps)

242
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:51,253
(tires screech, slurps)

243
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,706
Whoop!

244
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,756
They got an open bar
at this thing, right?

245
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,010
Wow. Troopers from every state
in New England.

246
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,854
Including Rhode Island!

247
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,389
We’re a small state,
but we give big tickets.

248
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,063
Hey, guys, didja hear?

249
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,352
<i>The Da Vinci Code </i>just sold
one hundred million copies!

250
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,346
(groaning)

251
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,397
(chuckles)

252
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,820
(elegant music plays)

253
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,568
(gasps):
It’s Tom Wolfe!

254
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,780
He uses more
exclamation points

255
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,530
than any other major
American writer.

256
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,992
It’s true!

257
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,742
How ya doin’ there?
Uh, Moe Szyslak.

258
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,374
Ah, magnificent Moe.

259
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,412
He stands, stoop-shouldered,

260
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,155
blinking in the light,

261
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,287
hollow-chested like
a dough-faced fall guy

262
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,044
who’s made a career of taking
dives but has decided

263
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,007
to get his manhood out of hock
and take a shot at the title--

264
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,878
or at least go for
the jaw and-- thwack--

265
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,886
hyperextend the
champ’s pterygoideus

266
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,638
before kissing
the mat good night.

267
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,430
<i>MOE:</i>
<i>You ever scrub your hands</i>

268
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,636
real fast, and you think
you’re seein’ a third one?

269
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,307
One time I looked down
and there really was.

270
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,726
I gotta get a new lock
for that bathroom.

271
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,185
(all laughing)

272
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,704
Moe, your debut poem
is as refreshing

273
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,490
as a second pair of
socks on a wet hike.

274
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:07,124
I must know how you came up
with that brilliant title,

275
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,833
"Howling at a Concrete Moon."

276
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,956
Uh, well actually, I had
some help on the title...

277
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:13,962
(all gasping)

278
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,048
You needed help
to write your title?

279
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,260
Well, so have I,
Gore Vidal.

280
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:23,931
<i>1876 </i>was the price
I paid for gas once.

281
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,511
I thought of <i>Burr</i>

282
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,096
when I saw it written
on an Eskimo Pie package.

283
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,562
I can’t believe it!

284
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,812
Those sound like
terrible jokes!

285
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,314
Sir, I must ask you to
pick up your gift bag
and leave this festival.

286
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,977
I don’t need
your sycophantic laughter!

287
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,027
I have some on tape.

288
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,490
(sycophantic laughter)

289
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:48,791
You still love me,
Temple University Class
of 1987.

290
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,205
So Moe, you were telling us
how you came up with your title.

291
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,171
Yeah, well, I-I was just saying
that um...

292
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,303
...that I, uh, I thought it up
all by myself.

293
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,421
(gasps)

294
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,967
Ah, like a real writer.
Outstanding, Moe!

295
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,602
To the hayride!

296
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,809

00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,908
{\an8}I’d like
to introduce our panel:

305
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,245
{\an8}Jonathan Franzen,
Michael Chabon, and Moe.

306
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,581
{\an8}Whoa, clear water.

307
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,957
Swanky! Whoo-hoo.

308
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,303
Now we’ll open the floor

309
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,918
to fawning praise
and obvious questions.

310
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,586
(Lisa grunting)

311
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,134
Uh, yeah, first of all,

312
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,837
I’d like to thank all of you
for your brilliant work.

313
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,387
(applause)

314
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,260
Yes, yes.

315
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,477
My question is, who are
your biggest influences?

316
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,559
I’d have to say
my good friend Jonathan Franzen.

317
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,515
I thought his novel
<i>The Corrections </i>needed none.

318
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,147
Cha-bone...!

319
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,994
Well, in turn, I’d have to say
my biggest influence is...

320
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,490
Albert Camus.

321
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,532
You were supposed
to say me.

322
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,406
I blurbed you.

323
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:12,081
Yeah, and it looks
real sweet on my dust jacket.

324
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,581
How do you like me now?

325
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,292
Fran-zone...!

326
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,253
Moe, who inspired you
to become a writer?

327
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,464
Jack Kerouac?
Charles Bukowski?

328
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,964
Me, Tom Wolfe?

329
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,756
Well, I dunno, uh...
the only book I ever read

330
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,129
was <i>Super Hounds: The Ultimate</i>
<i>Greyhound Betting System.</i>

331
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,967
So, uh, any of you, uh,
Wet-Naps write that?

332
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,354
(laughter)

333
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,642
Mr. Szyslak, there
must be some person,

334
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,806
possibly in this very room,

335
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,395
who believed in you
when no one else did.

336
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,111
Oh, uh, yeah,
I get what you’re gettin’ at.

337
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,032
Um... nope.

338
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,400
But how can you...?

339
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,407
Now, now, he’s answered
your question.

340
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,949
I declare this panel
dismissed.

341
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,663
-(bangs gavel)
-But I deserve acknowledgement.

342
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,293
-(bangs gavel)
-I said dismissed.

343
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,868
Lisa, grab your
sightseeing shoes.

344
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,918
We’re going Vermonting.

345
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,711
It’s gonna be awesome.

346
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,705
Man, couples in this state
sure like to clink glasses.

347
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,878
(sighs sadly)

348
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,756
You guys go ahead.

349
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,102
I don’t think
I’d be very good company.

350
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,968
Hey, thanks
for the heads up.

351
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,015
We’ll see you
when we see you.
(sighs)

352
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,152
I love these
covered bridges.

353
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,520
It’s like driving through
cute little houses.

354
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,357
That was my house,
you moron.

355
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,150
Oh, I’m sorry.

356
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,448
We should exchange
insurance information.

357
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,912
<i>I </i>have none.

358
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,166
(geese honking)

359
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,879
(grunting)

360
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,463
No food for you
grad students

361
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,758
till you grade
3,000 papers.

362
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,092
(yelling)

363
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,597
Hey, hey,
there you are.

364
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,259
I’ve been
lookin’ for ya.

365
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,057
I need a brilliant new poem
for the farewell dinner.

366
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,142
So if you could turn
these into one of those

367
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,687
and then don’t say nothin’
while I take all the credit,

368
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,191
I’d really appreciate it,
though I’d never admit that.

369
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,734
And, look, I got you started.

370
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,067
Huh? Huh?

371
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:11,782
Moe, you’re a heartless jerk.

372
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,954
Huh? Whoa,
where did that come from?

373
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,293
Oh, right, right, my actions.

374
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,908
Well, let’s see if I can put
this poem together.

375
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,456
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

376
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,580
Hah!

377
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,459
Hey, hey, hey.

378
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,804
Hey, st-stupid geese,
you’re eatin’ my brilliance.

379
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,381
-(geese squawking)
-Hey, hey,
I will break your beak.

380
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,637
What... Get... Hey...
Look at me.

381
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,549
It’s supposed to be
my big triumph,

382
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,177
and I’m standing in mud,
fightin’ with geese.

383
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,185
Well, if I’m gonna fight,
I might as well win.

384
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,938
(gunshots, geese honking)

385
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,270
Yeah, go on, you cowards.

386
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,935
Fly off in a "V."

387
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,485
Hey, Lis, we learned so much
scootin’ around Vermont.

388
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,951
Did you know that candles
are made by losers?

389
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,622
And we went to the Vermont
Teddy Bear Factory.

390
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,331
Look what we got.

391
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,161
Hmm? Hmm?

392
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:05,376
(crying)

393
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,339
Oh, honey, don’t cry.

394
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,379
They’re not made
from real bears--

395
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,803
just their fur and noses.

396
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:16,642
Moe marginalized
my contributions.

397
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,600
(both gasp)

398
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,639
(crying)

399
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,983
No one makes my
daughter sob and run.

400
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,310
He ruined
her first Wordloaf.

401
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,440
Look at me, sittin’ here
depressed when I’m surrounded

402
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,068
by the happiest people
in the world: writers.

403
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,948
-(clinking)
-Before Moe reads

404
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,333
his keynote poem,
I would like to stake my claim

405
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,830
to any unfinished
garlic mashed potatoes.

406
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,963
So please, if you would pass
them clockwise up to table one,

407
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,171
I will collect them later.

408
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,380
Now, I give you Moe Szyslak.

409
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,593
(applause)

410
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,925
Uh, this here poem is called
"Elevator Capacity."

411
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,101
(Moe clears throat)

412
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,019
"Elevator capacity:
2,400 pounds.

413
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,179
Inspection Certificate
available

414
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,438
in hotel manager’s office."

415
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,897
You just pulled that
off the wall of the elevator.

416
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,862
Yeah, well, uh, uh, here’s
another one you might like.

417
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,152
(clears throat)

418
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,235
"Channel 61: Family Favorites.

419
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,490
Channel 62: Adult Desires.

420
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,663
Channel 63: In-Room Checkout.

421
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,121
Chan..."

422
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,838
You know what?
I got a different poem for yaz.

423
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,919
(shocked murmuring)

424
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,755
Ode to Lisa:
Pointy-headed mini-muse

425
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,222
More friend than I deserved

426
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,603
You pulled me from the dirt

427
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,930
And made me
the beautiful flower
that I am.

428
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,386
But some flowers
can stab you in the back

429
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,936
For which I should
send you flowers

430
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,481
Which I will,
but they were closed

431
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,904
You’ll be
getting them tomorrow.

432
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,572
Oh, Moe.

433
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,190
Lisa, if you could
just forgive me,

434
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,447
you would make me
the happiest man in Vermont.

435
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,619
Except for those two dudes
I saw gettin’ hitched.

436
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,118
Not my thing, but
I wish ’em well.

437
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,871
Make my daughter
cry, will ya.

438
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,412
Eat syrup, jerk.

439
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,405
Wha...?

440
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,406
Dad, no!

441
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,127
I’m not mad at Moe anymore.

442
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,339
Uh, Homer,
would it make you feel better

443
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,089
if, uh, any of that hit me?

444
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,881
HOMER:
No, not now.

445
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,344
I’m gonna
walk away then. Okay?

446
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,851
Wow. You couldn’t
make this stuff up.

447
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,180
Well, <i>you </i>couldn’t.

448
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,524
That’s it, Franzen.

449
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,019
I think your nose
needs some corrections.

450
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,562
(both grunting)

451
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,396
Ooh, you fight
like Anne Rice.

452
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,276
Well, Moe, I guess
we’re friends again.

453
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,034
That’s great.

454
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,275
Now what do you say we do some
regional duck pin bowling?

455
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,658
I’d like that.

456
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,414
I’d like it a lot.

457
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,752
Aw, that’s sweet.

458
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:51,922
I hate sweet.

459
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,920
I need photos.
Photos of Spider-Man.

460
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,462
This is a
poetry journal.

461
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,915
Okay, then poems
about Spider-Man.

462
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,545
And I want them finished
before you start.

463
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,012
And before you finish,
get me some coffee.

464
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,552
And the poems should have
the following rhyme scheme:

465
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,505
A-B-B-A-A-B-B-A-C-D-E-C-D-E.

466
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,386
What are you waitin’ for,
Chinese New Year?

467
