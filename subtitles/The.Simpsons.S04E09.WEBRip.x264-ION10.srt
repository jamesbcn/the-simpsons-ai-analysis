Michelle Pfeiffer, hah.

101
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,453
The only true Catwoman
is Julie Newmar

102
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,156
Lee Meriwether,
or Eartha Kitt.

103
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:35,377

to improve my physique.

Pure West.

105
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,625
And how come Batman
doesn't dance anymore?

106
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,255

107
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,104
Nice meeting you.

108

Don't make eye contact.

Wow!

110
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:57,145
Just think what I could do
with that plow.

111
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,239
Homer, I've got to sneak
these valuable art works

112

out of the white house,

113
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,907
but I can't get out
of my driveway

114
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,870

of these protesters.

115

those young people

116

Oh, I can't
afford it.

120
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,840
Pally, this doesn't cost money,
it makes money.

121
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:27,095
You make the payments by
plowing driveways on the side.

122
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,178
Well, I really should
discuss this with my wife.

123
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,224
Your wife?

124
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,427

126

that noise?

127

(cracking whip)

128
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,400
I'll take it!

129
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,357
I can't believe
you bought that plow.

130
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,485
We can't afford it.

131
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,571
If you're gonna
get mad at me

132
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,826
every time
I do something stupid

133
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,408
then I guess I'll just have
to stop doing stupid things.

134
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,954
-Good.
-Fine.

135
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,287
I'll never, ever do
another stupid thing.

136
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,333
Good night.

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,130
Oh, Homie,
didn't that hurt?

138
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,000
No.

just can't get a break.

152
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,198
Well, at least
I can't sink any lower.

154
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,707

155
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,290

159
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,719
Dear Lord,
in your infinite wisdom

160
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,181
you know the number to call
when you need a plow

161
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:54,182
is Klondike 5-3226.

162
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,975
Homer,
this is really low.

163
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,728
Not as low
as my low, low prices.

164
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,271

180

Wow, Moe.

244
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:32,399
You didn't even give a beer
to those freed Iranian hostages.

245
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,533
They shouldn't have been there

00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,323
All right.

352
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,366
Mr. Simpson
I guarantee you

353
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:34,658
we'll come up with a commercial
that can save your business.

354
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,793
You know those radio ads
where two people with

355
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,000
annoying voices yammer
back and forth?

356
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,041
I invented those.

357
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,424
-(grunts)
-Ow!

358
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,338

360
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,187

361
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,815
I don't know.

362
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,951
The torch has been passed

363
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,659

364
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,660
snow plow people.

365
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,287
Come on,
give me the key.

366
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,789
These look like teeth marks.

367
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,961
I thought there was
chocolate inside.

368
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,790
Well, why was it
wrapped in foil?

369
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,625
It was never
wrapped in foil.

370

379
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,611
Hello, Plow King?

380
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,782
I was wondering if you could
plow my driveway

381
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,992
on top of forbidding
Widow's Peak.

382
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,533
I don't know.
I'd be up there all day.

383
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,037
I wouldn't be able to
plow any other driveways.

384
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,749
There's a $10,000 bill in it
for you.

385
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,210
Oh, yeah?
Which president's on it?

386
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:08,171
Uh, all of them.
They're having a party.

387
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,013
Jimmy Carter's passed out
on the couch.

388
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,009
Wow! I'll be right there.

389
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,301
Barney,
I'd like to put

390
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,553

00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,113
Well, I guess
you can plow my driveway

396
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,730
but I wonder what happened
to the Plow King.

397
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,398
Oh, I guess he just doesn't
respect his customers.

398
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,567
Oh, could you make sure
not to scrape my asphalt?

399
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,827
Kiss my asphalt.

400
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,788

"Kiss my asphalt."
