I am so excited for
the scout jamboree this weekend.

00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,536
Dad, hand over the family bugle!

7
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:36,836
Here she is!

Old Blowy.

What? You're not a boy!

12
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,848
You can't join
the Boy Explorers!

13
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,777
And that's a flugelhorn!

14
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,982
Yes. It's the hardest horn.

15
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,994
And, FYI, I did join.

16
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,516
And I already have
three badges...

17
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:56,892
environmentalism,

18
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,960
badge-receiving,

19
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,888
and sibling rivalry.

00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,563
Come on, you two...

We are the anarchist collective

25
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,539
who published the internal
emails of Waffle House

26
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:19,552
and brought Home Depot's
"Find a store near you" feature

27
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,046
to its knees.

28
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:25,188
FEMALE HACKER:
Now we have hacked into
the Disney Corporation's servers

29
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:29,255
and seized hundreds of hours

30
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,256
from the television show
<i>The Simpsons.</i>

31
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,699
Stories so ill-conceived,

32
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,195
so idiotic

33
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,226
that their exposure
would destroy

34
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:41,442
the value
of the very I. P. itself.

35
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:45,605
Until we are paid a ransom
of $20 million in Bitcoin,

36
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,736
we will air
these show-destroying scenes

37
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:50,112
one after another,

38
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,250
starting now.

39
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:57,115
No, no, it can't be true!

40
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,947
It is true, Carl.

41
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,022
There never was a Lenny.

42
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:04,661
So Lenny was just a figment
of my imagination?

43
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,288
I... I made him up?

44
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,403
Yeah, your psyche
created "Lenny"

45
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,955
to help you deal
with a terrible trauma there.

46
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,644
- What trauma?
- Finding out your previous
best friend wasn't real.

47
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,235
It's kind of a thing with you.

48
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,566
Huh. Hey, I haven't seen you
in here before.

49
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,243
I'm Carl. What's your name?

50
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,081
Nice to meet you, Steven.

51
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,276
Aw, crap, here we go again.

52
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,553
Now you see
we mean business, Disney.

53
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:32,549
You will submit $20 million
in Bitcoin to our crypto wallet

54
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,623
at the following address.

55
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:35,991
Until the payment arrives,

56
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,729
we will keep playing
these nonsensical clips

57
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,055
no one was ever meant to see.

58
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,927
What's his name?

59
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,172
Number Eight.

60
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,536

00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,873
Greetings,
lamewads from the past!

63
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:56,383
I have come back in time to
reveal the events of the future,

64
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:59,106
so that you can amaze the world

65
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:03,222
with your uncannily accurate
predictions!

66
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,347
Less yelling, more foretelling.

67
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,592
My first shocking prediction is,

68
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:08,888
in 2016,

69
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:12,589
the Nobel Prize in Economics
will go to...

70
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:14,603
Bengt R. Holmstr öm!

71
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:17,025
Why would anyone care
if we predicted that?

72
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,400
I don't know, but they will.

73
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,098
Do you have anything
a little more...

74
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,000
oh, impressive?

75
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,602
Donald Trump
is gonna be president.

76
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:26,544
(screams) Less impressive!
Less impressive!

77
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,680
Okay, let's see. You're gonna
want to mention gas hoarding,

78
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:30,876
pandemics,

79
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,908
Germany beats Brazil
in the 2014 World Cup,

80
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,124
Disney buys Fox.

81
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,975
And then they both go under?!

82
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:39,354
No, they're both absorbed
by Panda Express.

83
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:42,063
Pretty much everything now
is Panda Express.

84
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,485
- That makes sense.
- I get it.

85
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,560
Ooh! Orange chicken.

86
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,828
Arr.

87
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,843
Yarr.

88
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,395
Aye.

89
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,673
- Yarr!
- Aye!

90
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,435
(gulping)

91
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,580
Yarr?

92
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,035
(chuckles):
Aye.

93
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:07,953
Yarr!

94
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,348
Aye!

95
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,649
Aye?

96
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,524
Yarr.

97
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:16,662
Aye?

98
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:17,687
Yarr!

99
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,259
Aye?

100
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,160
Yarr!

101
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:23,901
- Aye! Aye!
- Yarr! Yarr!

102
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,227
- Aye!
- Yarr!

103
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,267
Aye!

104
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,069
(sighs):
Aye!

105
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,710
(sighs):

106
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,335
Yarr.

107
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:38,084
<i>- Yarr, yarr, yarr, yarr...!
- Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye,
aye, aye, aye, aye, aye!</i>

108
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,615
Till the morrow, chums!

109
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,518
(groans)

110
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,119
-(children laughing)
-(humming happily)

111
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,390
(groans)

112
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,331
WOMAN (New York accent):
Is that you, babe?

113
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:55,497
(New York accent):
Yeah, yeah, I'm home.

114
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,395
- Daddy! Daddy! How was school?
- Hey.

115
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,628
It ain't school for Daddy, sweetheart.

116
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:01,774
It's work.

117
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:05,008
Soul-sucking, grueling work.

118
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,365
Then why don't you quit?

119
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,943
Always with the quitting,
this one.

120
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,382
I can't do that, Doreen!

121
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:15,878
The police department
needs someone inside the school!

122
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,993
So why's it got to be you?

123
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,045
Look at me, Didi.

124
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,052
I'm the only 36-year-old

125
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,024
who can pass for ten!

126
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,033
How 'bout passing
for a good father?

127
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,525
The kids hardly know you.

128
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:29,697
You're out every afternoon
till 3:00 p. m.

129
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,626
4:00 if there's chess club.

130
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,032
You think I want to be there?

131
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,573
Martin likes chess!

132
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,398
Not me!

133
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:41,741
I don't know where Martin ends
and my Reggie begins!

134
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,982
(crying)

135
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,675
Aw, maybe you're right.

136
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,494
Maybe I am in too deep.

137
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:55,856
It's just, when I was diagnosed
with... this,

138
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,156
I said,
"I'm not gonna let it beat me.

139
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,258
I'm gonna use it for good!"

140
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,860
I'm doing good, aren't I?

141
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,033
You are, Reg.

142
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,831
You're a great role model
for your kids.

143
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,844
All three of 'em.

144
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:10,636
(gasps)
You mean...?

145
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:11,937
I do.

146
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,009
(distorted): They still
haven't paid the ransom.

147
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,338
Did they not see
the nonsense we just released?

148
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:19,514
How is Martin Prince
an adult cop?

149
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:21,753
(distorted):
Well, maybe I overestimated

150
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,918
how much
Disney cares about Lenny.

151
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,587
No, it's not your fault.

152
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:28,216
You're the finest
digital terrorist I know.

153
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:31,932
Your malware shut down the
Portland Airport for two weeks.

154
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:35,125
(chuckles)
Everyone missed Thanksgiving.

155
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,398
It's sweet you remembered.

156
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,867
Aw, you're sweet, too.
(chuckles)

157
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,498
We should probably get back to...

158
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,643
(non-distorted):
blackmailing
the major corporation.

159
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,938
Wait! Why did the voice-changing
app switch off?

160
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:51,311
(non-distorted British voice):
Bollocks. I didn't upgrade
to the premium edition,

161
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,851
and the free trial period
ran out, I'm afraid.

162
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,747
I am so daft.

163
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,349
Oh, my God, you're British?

164
00:06:57,351 --> 00:07:00,991
That must be delightful
for your wife or girlfriend.

165
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:02,388
Oh, no, I'm painfully single.

166
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:05,089
Nary a romantic appointment
in my "shed-you-ul."

167
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,992
Say that last part again.

168
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:09,264
You mean... "shed-you-ul"?

169
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:12,103
(sultrily):
Shed-you-ul.

170
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,069
MALE HACKER:
Shed-you-ul.

-(moaning)
-(masks clacking)

172
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,110
Oh! We're back on! We're live!

173
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,308
Well, I-I suppose we should
threaten them some more.

174
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,950
How about I just run another
batch of show-ruining clips

175
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,077
so we can...

176
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,051
Topple the capitalist system

177
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,650
and its bought-and-paid-for...

178
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:34,562
Political enablers.

179
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:37,987
(speaking French)

180
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,191
(chuckles)

181
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:43,725
<i>OPERATOR:
Do you speak English?</i>

182
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:52,209
We're trapped!
Someone get help!

183
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,654
<i>I can't help
if I can't understand you.</i>

184
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,117
Won't anyone do something?!

185
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,701
<i>(groans) Never mind.</i>

186
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,670
Let me get this straight.

187
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:28,681
You mowed down all that corn
to build a football field,

188
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,845
hoping it would lure
the ghosts of former players

189
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,805
down from football heaven?

190
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:36,284
Uh-huh. And look!

191
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:41,188
Hey, I don't recognize
any of these guys.

192
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,918
Why are there two 50-yard lines?

193
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,194
Aw, damn it!

194
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,332
I built a Canadian field!

195
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:49,601
Oh. Sorry, hoser.

196
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:50,696
My bad, eh?

197
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,127
Hey, nice rouge there, Gordo.

198
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,103
Hey, Homer!
Throw you a Hail Mary?

199
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:57,402
Shut up, Flutie.

200
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:02,676
Uh, yes. (clears throat)
The day is Sol, uh, 150.

201
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,806
I am stranded on Mars.

202
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:08,951
I suspect my fellow astronauts
left me behind on purpose,

203
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:10,479
as from the bathroom

204
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:12,694
I did hear the giggling
and the shushing

205
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:16,186
and the "Blast off quick
before he's done tinkling."

206
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,790
I have a mere three days
of air and water remaining.

207
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,233
There is no hope.

208
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,229
Unless
I glayvenate the hydrogen,

209
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,771
flavenize the oxygen,

210
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:28,366
and, yes, yes,
poopulate the soil!

211
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:31,408
It was a simple matter
of applying pseudoscience

212
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:35,275
and phantasmagorical engineering
to the problem. Yes.

213
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:38,345
Oh, yes, I also cloned myself
for company.

214
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:40,475
And my fellow Frinks
have built us all

215
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,350
an escape rocket.
Isn't that wonderful?

216
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:45,419
(clones laughing, chattering)

217
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,889
Leaving!

218
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,757
(gasps)

219
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,055
Aw, flayvin me in the glayvin!

220
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:54,363
Hello. This is Homer Simpson.

221
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,431
From the bottom of my heart,
I apologize

222
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,670
to the great, great,
great people of Finland

223
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,696
for what I said.

224
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,671
I have done many, many,

225
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,809
many, many, many episodes,

226
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,735
and in one of those... just one...

227
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,380
I mixed you up with Norway.

228
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:13,005
And I have so, so, so, so,
so much love and respect for...

229
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,923
I think "Finns"
is what you're called.

230
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,675
And if I ever... I mean ever...

231
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,493
ever, ever, ever thought

232
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,215
that an innocent slip
of the tongue

233
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,960
is something
that an entire nation

234
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,215
could get worked up about,

235
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,433
I would've kept my mouth shut.

236
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:29,325
And the scary, scary, scary,
oh-so-scary lawyers

237
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,669
of the giant, giant...
I mean giant...

238
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:35,095
so, so giant,
scary corporation I work for

239
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:37,802
would not have had to draft
this statement.

240
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,114
God bless you

241
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,976
and all the peoples
of South America,

242
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,475
for you are a... What?

243
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,878
What do you mean
I have to record it again?

244
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,150
What did I say?

245
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:56,958
You're chewing too loud.

246
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,887
From now on,
only two chews per bite.

247
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,603
One, two, swallow.
One, two, swallow.

248
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:07,196
I think I've misplaced
my appetite, mother.

249
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:13,136
I need to see you right now.

250
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,111
I deserve this.

251
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,552
I deserve to feel like a man.

252
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:26,189
Only with you
do I truly feel alive.

253
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,686
I made this just for you.

254
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,019
Thank you, Mother.

255
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:35,504
Anything for my son.
I am so proud of you.

256
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:38,195
Oh, Mommy.
I can't wait another second.

257
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,898
You know I need it.

258
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,100
(sultry music playing)

259
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,790
I almost forgot
to give you this.

260
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,688
Leave it on the dresser.

261
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,930
If only that were
my real mother.

262
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:14,270
(groans)
If only that were my real son.

263
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,509
(Homer humming happily)

264
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,565
I don't mean to be
unneighborly, but, uh,

265
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,384
you wouldn't know what happened
to my old nostril skirt?

266
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:27,207
Mustache you say?
Hmm, let me think.

267
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:30,684
Stroking this goatee
I've always had.

268
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:32,424
Stroking, stroking...

269
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:36,089
That's it.
Boys, we're Jewish now.

270
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,629
- ROD: L'chaim!
- TODD: To life!

271
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,764
Mmm.
(swallows)

272
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,973
From bun to pickle,
a masterpiece.

273
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:49,435
The exquisite flavor is matched
only by the peerless mouthfeel.

274
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,696
Five stars.

275
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:53,244
Bravo, Harvey Comics, bravo.

276
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,710
A stunning addition
to the Casper-verse.

277
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:57,679
No notes. Ten stars.

278
00:12:57,678 --> 00:13:00,148
With this level of
sour cream in your blood,

279
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:03,177
your brain is completely
starved of oxygen.

280
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,423
Consequently, you're a moron.

281
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:09,019
A perfect explanation.
Succinct and devastating.

282
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,792
Infinite stars!

283
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:15,501
Best. Diagnosis. Ev...
(groaning)

284
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:21,944
Give me a beer, pally.

285
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,935
Hey, I know you, don't I?

286
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,407
Nah, must be thinking
of someone else, slim.

287
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,736
No, I've definitely seen
you around town.

288
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:30,983
Sign here, chief.

289
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,748
Here's your passport, gorgeous.

290
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,676
Brake pads are shot, tough guy.

291
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,051
Want that toasted, honcho?

292
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,849
Found your car keys, big shot.

293
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:39,321
Those were all you!

294
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,149
I don't know
what to tell you, slick.

295
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,494
Just got that sort of face.

296
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,597
ALL:
Pally-pally-pally-pally-pally-

297
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:53,595
pally-pally-pally-pally-pally-
pally-pally-pally-pally-pally...

298
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:56,898
(moaning, smooching)

299
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:58,414
(exclaims)

300
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:02,735
- Oh, my God, you're beautiful.
- You're more beautiful!

301
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:04,143
Oh. Oh, dear.

302
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:07,314
The world has seen
our exquisite symmetrical faces.

303
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:10,624
Then they've also seen
that we're... in love?

304
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:11,817
My God. Yes.

305
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:13,718
Yes, that's what it is,
isn't it?

306
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,560
It is. (stammers)
It is stunning.

307
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:18,726
As stunning as this list
of abandoned episodes

308
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:22,495
that started as clever titles
and went nowhere.

Are we crazy?

318
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:52,527
Can two people,
forbidden from sharing

319
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:56,196
any personal information,
really make a life together?

320
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,196
I do think we owe it
to each other to try,

321
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:00,368
um... whoever you are.

322
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:01,797
I can't wait

323
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:05,412
until we're
Mr. and Mrs. Redacted.

324
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,205
-(banging on door)
- AGENT: FBI.

325
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,738
Surrender, hacker scum!

326
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:13,183
If we're going down,
we'll take The Simpsons with us.

327
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,420
- I'm gonna play the dog scene.
-(exclaims)

328
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:22,394
(upbeat voice):
Good morning, Homer.

329
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:26,732
It's morning?!

330
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:33,228
-(banging on door)
- AGENT: FBI.

331
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,773
We've got
you cyberterrorists surrounded.

332
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:35,998
This is it, darling.

333
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:38,043
I've cued up the very
worst-of-the-worst clips

334
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:39,308
to play one by one.

335
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:42,276
When we push this button,
The Simpsons dies.

336
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:44,706
- Together, then?
- Together.

337
00:15:46,547 --> 00:15:49,147
The lies... stop... now.

338
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,819
- Aah!
-(gasps)

339
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,987
I know Eddie is Ralph's father.

340
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,516
Look at the hair.
Look at the hair!

341
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:58,262
No, Clancy,
I swear to you it's not true.

342
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:01,628
My son's breath
smells like cat food.

343
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,158
Okay, you got me.

344
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,235
(quietly):
I'll have the veal.

345
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:12,666
The lies... stop... now!

346
00:16:12,673 --> 00:16:14,113
(grunts)

347
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,107
I did a DNA test.

348
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,849
I'm not your son.

349
00:16:17,845 --> 00:16:19,845
Luann, how could you?!

350
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:21,477
I'm not hers either.

351
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,081
We're not your parents?

352
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,594
- All right.
- Oh, thank God!

353
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:28,416
- Yes!
- Oh...

354
00:16:29,223 --> 00:16:32,663
(weakly):

I'm not your sister.

But... but... wait, what?

360
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:45,938
I was young and briefly hot.
It was a different time.

Back then, we solved things
with huge lies.

Then, who was my real father?

363
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:55,145
His name was Disco...
(grunts)

364
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:58,048
Disco...

365

Two days ago.

I had so many adventures.

When we get home,
can we turn on the TV

440
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:17,283
and never, ever go
outdoors again?

441
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:20,224
- Please?
- Pretty please?

00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:26,385

almost got divorced

over something insignificant.

446
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:30,931
Luckily, your dad apologized.

447
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:32,971
Yup, I got it down
at this point.

448
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:35,266
