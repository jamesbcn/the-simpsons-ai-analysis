to get you a present,

Well, I need something
for my son's birthday.

70
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,085

it carries a terrible curse.

But it comes with
a free frogurt.

76
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,319
-That's good.
-The frogurt is also cursed.

77
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,398
-That's bad.
-But you get your choice of topping.

78
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,145
-That's good.
