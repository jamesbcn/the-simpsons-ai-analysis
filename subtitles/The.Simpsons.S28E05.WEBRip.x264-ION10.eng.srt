I don't remember him.

at the start of this sentence!

-He was from America, Jimmy.

To me, it was just another day
at the office.

102
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,613
Only this day, the office
was a burning piece of metal

103
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,031
where an RPG just took out the pilot.

104
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,900

and guided that wounded bird

105
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,658
down onto a container ship...
which was sinking.

106

-Hmm?
-Hmm?

174
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,509
Hmm, I don't think candy should
give me a tingling in my left arm.

175
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:29,468
{\an8}I'm gonna prove to you that Krusty
is a good clown with nonlethal candy.

176
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,140
Hey, Otto-man, can you take us
to the food processing district?

177
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,010
-No way, Bartman.
-Hey, Otto, I just remembered,

178
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,137
we have a field trip
to the food processing district.

The man who betrayed our trust.

216
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,914
Forget it.
We only like newspeople we can trust.

217
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,537
So no newspeople!

218
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,424
Oh, well, I have bigger problems.

Formaldehyde! Do you understand?

Do not imbibe!

274
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,770

I'm gonna have to go off the grid.

289
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,070
All right, Kent Brockman.
Welcome to BizzFad.

290
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,573
We are so crunched.

291
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,815
(chuckles) Well, the crunching is mutual.

292
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,407
"The crunching is mutual"?
What the hell does that mean?

293
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,413
Well, I know that the media has changed,

294
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,665
but this old newshound
can still find his way home.

295
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,998
Okay...

296
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,884
I thought I might do a piece

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,600
Uh, gentlemen,
I suggest we ramp up production.

306
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:20,028
I have a few suggestions
right here in my pocket.

307
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,486
Do it, Homer! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

308
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,241

313
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,880
I'd close that tent flap
before the mosquitoes get in.

314
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,958
What the... I thought you would like it.

315
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,674
Actually, I think
you should take this tarp

316
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,045
back to the baseball stadium
you got it from.

317
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,933
In case there's a rain delay.

318
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,680
(chuckles) I did not see that coming, sir.

319
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,682
Off you go, Simpson.
Never seek to better yourself again.

320
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,305
I'm just going to shove my foot
on your back for emphasis.

321
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,443
Yes, sir. I understand.

322
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,400
But could you try not
to get my new jacket dirty?

323
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,691
Sorry, but no.

324
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,284
Well done, sir.

325
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,070
Now your turn, Smithers.

326
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,784
I never thought you'd ask.

327
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,291
So, why do you want to give
the story to Brockman?

328
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,789
Because the best thing
you can do is offer a lifeline

329
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,622
to a person with no hope.

330
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,127
-Here I am!
-Sorry, not you.

331
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,499
Thank God!

332
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,666
Well, how do you know
where Brockman will be?

333
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:26,585
To find a fallen man, you must visit
the scene of his highest peak.

334
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,175
When he reported on the flood of '09.

335
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,019
My career and these flood waters
crested at the same time.

336
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,599
This is Kent Brockman blowing a sad song
on his beer bottle.

337
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,106
(playing sad tune)

338
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,900
Mr. Brockman,
we've uncovered a huge story!

339
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:48,815
And we need a real newsman
to break it wide open.

340
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,039
(sighs)

341
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,618
A real newsman, eh?

342
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,123
Then you've come to the wrong corner.

343
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,575
-What do you mean?
-Oh, I'm through.

344
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,166
Now, please, let me just go out

345
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,880
with my remaining dignity intact.

346
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,972
This is Kent Brockman
thinking dark and suicidal thoughts.

347
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,378
It's quiet here in the gutter.

348
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,626
Very quiet.

349
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,387
Well, it <i>was.</i>

350
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,894
Okay, who would like to start today?

351
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,687
Anyone? Anyone?

352
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,772
Oh, come on.

353
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,360
In three, two...

354
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:31,155
-I'm here live at the support group...
-Our top feeling today...

355
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,200
This just in-- I'm sad.

356
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,203
(slurring)
You know, I'll be tooling around,

357
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:40,075
and I'll just constantly lapse
into my elocution exercises.

358
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,835
"A Lockheed L-1011 landed safely

359
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,298
in Bogalusa, Louisiana, after an alert."

360
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,629
Oh, I've been there.

361
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,804
-Too true.
-Courage.

00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,931
Kent, you're looking unusually thoughtful

363
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,510
and silent for an anchor.

364
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,604
You know, I thought I'd come to terms
with life off the news cycle,

365
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,891
and then, bang,
I was offered a scoop on a platter.

366
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,016
(slurring)
Well, did you leap on that lead

367
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,653

homemade Bundt cake? Mmm.

371
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,664
Kent, why are you doing this?

372
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,292
Why did you get into this business?

373
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,788
Money, women, free coffee. The usual.

Sir, if you please, these days,
a bona fide uncorrupted story

It's harder to find than
a yellow-fronted bowerbird.

Jump on it, hoss,
