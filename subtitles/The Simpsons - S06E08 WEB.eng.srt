1
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:06,131
The Simpsons.

2
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,580
It's Channel Six Action News.

3
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,835
Ah, Action News,
the last place

4
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:46,546
an impressionable kid
can go for TV violence.

5
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,131
Now, here's
your action anchor.

6
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,299
Kent Brockman.

7
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,675
Hello. I'm Kent Brockman.

8
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,218
Our top stories tonight:

9
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,304
A tremendous explosion
in the price of lumber.

10
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,890
"President Reagan dyes...

11
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,600
his hair,"
says Garry Trudeau

12
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,351
in his new
musical comedy revue.

13
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,187
But first, let's check
the death count

14
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,147
from the killer storm
bearing down on us

15
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,274
like a shotgun full of snow.

16
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:09,486
Well, Kent, as of now,
the death count is zero

17
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,488
but it is ready
to shoot right up.

18
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,281
Oh, my God.

19
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,325
Damn you, snow!

20
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,036
All right, snow day!
No school tomorrow.

21
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,515
That doesn't mean you don't
have to do your book report.

22
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,041
What if the weatherman
is wrong?

23
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:26,377
Lisa, that man is a
professional meteorologist.

24
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,712
Kent,
I'd like to remind

25
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,339
everybody to come down
and watch me

26
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,007
at the Springfield
Laugh 'n' Brew

27
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,093
and Burgers 'n' Fries
this Saturday.

28
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,427
The forecast calls

29
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,180
for a 75% chance
of hilarity.

30
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,765
I like those odds.

31
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,268
Snowball fight!

32
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,696
You're going to eat
a blizzard of...

33
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,241
unseasonable warmth?

34
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,160
I made the snowball
from the frost in our freezer.

35
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,957
Nice P.J.s, Simpson.

36
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,875
Did your mommy buy them for you?

37
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,002
Of course she did.
Who else would have?

38
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:13,508
All right, Simpson,
you win this round.

39
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,095
Okay, it's book report time.

40
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,097
We'll do them alphabetically.

41
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,015
Today it's
"A" through "M."

42
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,099
I'm saved.

43
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,519
I love being a S-S-S-Simpson.

44
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,689
Let's see, we have no A's,
so let's go right to the B's.

45
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:28,772
Bart?

46
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,026
Mrs. Krabappel,

47
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,028
I... didn't...

48
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,114
Attention.
This is Principal Skinner,

49
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:39,325
your principal, with a message
from the principal's office.

50
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,162
All students please proceed
immediately to an assembly

51
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,122
in the Butthead
Memorial Auditorium.

52
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,958
Damn it, I wish we hadn't let
the students name that one.

53
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,962
Children, the times they are
a-becoming quite different.

54
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,965
Test scores are
at an all-time low,

55
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:57,218
so I've come up
with these academic alerts.

56
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,637
You will receive one as soon
as your grades start to slip

57
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,139
in any subject.

58
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,932
This way, your parents
won't have to wait

59
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,326
until report card time
to punish you.

60
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,352
How innovative.
I like it.

61
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,355
Hey, Dolph, take a memo
on your Newton.

62
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,439
"Beat up Martin."

63
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,656
All right,
first academic alert...

64
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,283
Wiggum, Ralph.

65
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,202
I won, I won!

66
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,580
No, no, Ralph.

67
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,123
This means you're
failing English.

68
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,541
Me, fail English?

69
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,543
That's unpossible.

70
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,961
Muntz, Nelson.

71
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,463
You're failing
History, Geography

72
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,923
and Math, but, uh...

73
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,366
you're doing quite well
in Home Ec.

74
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,426
Hey, keep it down, man.

75
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,346
Simpson.

76
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,429
Lisa.

77
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,099
Grades are all I have.

78
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,684
What could I be failing?

79
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,187
I'm smart and a teacher's pet.

80
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,232
Gym?

81
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,026
That's the stupidest thing
I ever heard.

82
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,411
Lisa, your father and I

83
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,455
are very concerned
about this warning.

84
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,457
I really hope
you try harder.

85
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,084
Whoo,
that's all of them.

86
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,045
And I'm so proud you
didn't try to forge my name.

87
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,797
How about
a present, son?

88
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,132
Well, I could use a new pair
of hockey skates.

89
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,217
Done and done.

90
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,510
That's not fair.

91
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,387
Why is Bart getting a present

92
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,638
and I'm getting chewed out?

93
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,932
Ah, the mysteries
of life.

94
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,433
Tell you what, Simpson.

95
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,810
I won't fail you

96
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,079
if you join one
of those peewee teams

97
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,729
outside the school.

98
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,415
You mean those leagues
where parents push their kids

99
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,358
into vicious competition
to compensate

100
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,610
for their own
failed dreams of glory?

101
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,529
Look, I don't need this.

102
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,490
I inhaled my favorite whistle
this morning.

103
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,164
D'oh, d'oh, d'oh, d'oh
d'oh, d'oh, d'oh.

104
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,258
Children, that was
our only ball.

105
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,968
There'll be no team
this year.

106
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,928
Aww...

107
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,392
Mom, this is really scary.

108
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,602
I'm going to get
my first "F" ever.

109
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,729
Cheer up!

110
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,272
So you're not good at sports.

111
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,857
It's a very small part of life.

112
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,359
Sports, sports,
sports, sports.

113
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,195
Marge, Bart rides up
in the front seat today

114
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,364
because he's a good
guy at sports.

115
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,367
I think Lisa needs to feel
a little special tonight.

116
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,202
How about letting her
ride up front too?

117
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,789
I tried.

118
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,376
Okay, son,
just remember

119
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,878
to have fun
out there today,

120
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:40,173
and if you lose,
I'll kill you!

121
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,216
Oh, Dad.

122
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,974
All right, Pigs,

123
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,225
beat those Gougers.

124
00:05:56,481 --> 00:06:00,026
I could have been
equipment manager, but, no!

125
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,247
Our goalie
cannot stand up.

126
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,166
Tell you what.
Get some rope.

127
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,558
Defense, defense, come on.

128
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,642
You call that blowing?

129
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,233
Oh, yes!
We won, we won, we won.

130
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,442
Unfortunately,

131
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,569
since I bet
on the other team,

132
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,571
uh, we won't be going for pizza.

133
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,991
Well, boy, you won.

134
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,369
So I'm going to live up
to my side of the agreement.

135
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,414
Here's your turtle,
alive and well.

136
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,082
Aw, thanks, Dad.

137
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,128
How about some adulation
from my little sister?

138
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,629
Wow, Bart, I'm so impressed

139
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,923
you were able to give Milhouse
a concussion.

140
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,217
Oh, you're just jealous

141
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,594
because... you...
stink...

142
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,430
at... sports.

143
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,431
Cut it out, Bart!

144
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,514
What the...

145
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:18,104
You know, I wonder if her
skills would transfer over

146
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,439
to the game of hockey.

147
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,899
Well, only one way to be sure.

148
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,776
Heads up, little girl.

149
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,573
The goalie of my dreams.

150
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,201
Let's try a hard one

151
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,661
to make sure
it wasn't a fluke.

152
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,957
Oh, hey!

153
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,209
Way to knock
out my teeth.

154
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,669
That's it, Milhouse.

155
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:42,752
Keep up the chatter.

156
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,968
Lisa,

157
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,262
if the Bible has taught us
nothing else...

158
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,014
And it hasn't...

159
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,433
It's that girls should
stick to girls' sports

160
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,393
such as hot-oil
wrestling,

161
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,645
foxy boxing
and such and such.

162
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,398
I think women should be able
to play any sport men play,

163
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,817
but hockey is so violent
and dangerous.

164
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,445
Look at Milhouse's teeth.

165
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,071
Mom, will you stop
showing us those?

166
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,365
I have to join the team,
or I'll get an "F"

167
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,367
that will haunt me
for the rest of my life.

168
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,331
I now pronounce you
president of these United...

169
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,749
Stop the inauguration!

170
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,918
I just discovered
our president-elect

171
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,920
got an "F"
in second grade gym class.

172
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,964
In that case,
I sentence you

173
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,510
to a lifetime of horror
on Monster Island.

174
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,386
Don't worry.
It's just a name.

175
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,519
He said...
it was just a name.

176
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,996
What he meant is
that Monster Island

177
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,523
is actually a peninsula.

178
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,944
Do you have my teeth?

179
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,696
No.

180
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,494
Okay, hotshots,

181
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,246
now that my daughter
is on your team,

182
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,498
I want to make
a few things clear.

183
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,625
Please, Dad,
I'll be fine.

184
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,837
I don't want anyone
to give her a hard time

185
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,297
just because she's different.

186
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,258
No jokes, no taunting.

187
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,595
Look, that kid's got bosoms!
Who's got a wet towel?

188
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,099
Come here,
you butterball.

189
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,433
Don't make me run!

190
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,851
I'm full of chocolate.

191
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,984
Whoa!

192
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,195
I can't even watch.

193
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,196
I don't know how
you two can sit here

194
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,906
laughing at poor Lisa

195
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,242
while she's out there
probably scared to death.

196
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,327
We're laughing
with her, Marge.

197
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,704
There's a big difference.

198
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,038
Whoa!

199
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,877
With her.

200
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,213
You really think I did okay
out there, Mom?

201
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,048
Absolutely, honey.

202
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,884
By blocking the net, I really
think you helped your team.

203
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,305
Okay, little buddy, hop in.

204
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,681
Hup-ah!

205
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,225
I mean,
my little girl buddy.

206
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,561
That's very nice, Dad,
but it's wrong for you

207
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,855
to reward violent,
competitive behavior.

208
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,565
However, I will
sit up front with you

209
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,442
if it's a fatherly
gesture of love.

210
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,818
Okay, honey.

211
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,528
Sucker!

212
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,655
Competitive violence...
That's why you're here!

213
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,512
We are having
our best season ever.

214
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:42,600
I would like to say that
it is because of teamwork.

215
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,185
Gee,
who am I kidding, huh?

216
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,603
It's all because of Lisa.

217
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,021
Let's hear it for Lisa.

218
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,359
Hey, Bart,

219
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,569
if Lisa's better
than you at hockey,

220
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,405
does that mean you're gonna
become better than her at school?

221
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,035
Maybe I will, Milhouse.

222
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,663
Maybe I will.

223
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,085
Who can tell me
the capital of Spain?

224
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,294
Bart Simpson.

225
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,004
The square root of 36?

226
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,756
Bart Simpson.

227
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,132
Who freed the slaves?

228
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,509
Bart Simpson.

229
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,593
Bart Simpson?

230
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,053
Bart Simpson.

231
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,347
Bart Simpson,
will you stop raising your hand?

232
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,908
You haven't had
one right answer all day.

233
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,974
Sorry.

234
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,020
This is for wasting
teacher's valuable time.

235
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,650
Lay off, guys!

236
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,151
He's with me.

237
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,237
It's a lucky coincidence

238
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,364
you happen to be
your sister's brother.

239
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,532
Don't worry, Bart.

240
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,575
They won't
bother you anymore.

241
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,124
I hardly ever let Mother
fight for me anymore.

242
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,667
Sorry, Bart.

243
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,878
I'm gonna hang out
with Lisa for protection...

244
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,922
and to be seen.

245
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,427
Come watch TV
with me, Dad.

246
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,113
We missed the first
two episodes of "Cops."

247
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,305
But if we hurry,
we can catch the last three.

248
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,767
Sorry, Bart. Lisa and I
are going out for gelato.

249
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,437
We'd ask you to come, but...

250
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,604
you know...

251
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,650
Bart, I can spend
some time with you.

252
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,277
I don't know, Mom.

253
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,421
Don't have a
stereotypical view of me

254
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,821
just because
I'm your mother.

255
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,742
I know, how about
we play the basketball?

256
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,827
I'm no Harvey
Globetrotter, but...

257
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,957
Watch out for
the Shaq attack!

258
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,086
I told you
to watch out.

259
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,089
Hey, Milhouse, knock him
down if he's in your way!

260
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,799
Jimbo, Jimbo,
go for the face!

261
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,761
Look. Ralph Wiggum
lost his shin guard!

262
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,220
Hack the bone!

263
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,930
Hack the bone!

264
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,642
Wow! Eye of the tiger.
Mouth of a Teamster.

265
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:53,314
Just think of all the time
I wasted on you!

266
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,608
Yeah, well, not wasted.

267
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,610
Uh... I love you.

268
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:03,824
Let me give my special
little winner a big, big hug.

269
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,620
Ma, I think
I'm all hugged out.

270
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,622
Oh, one more.

271
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,795
Hello, Queen Lisa.

272
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,755
Bart, what are you
doing in my room?

273
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:21,258
Lisa, certain differences...
Rivalries if you will...

274
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,718
Have come up between us.

275
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,428
At first, I thought
we could talk it over

276
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,096
like civilized people,

277
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,435
but instead, I just ripped
the head off Mr. Honeybunny.

278
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,021
Bart, that was your
cherished childhood toy.

279
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,398
Ah, Mr. Honeybunny!

280
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,986
Quiet down, Bart!

281
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,446
Bart, just
get out of here.

282
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,365
Hey, it's a free country.
You get out.

283
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,533
That doesn't make sense.

284
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,326
I know you are,
but what am I?

285
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,786
Get out! Get out!

286
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,663
Okay!

287
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:54,124
But on my way,
I'm going to be doing this.

288
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:58,796
If you get hit,
it's your own fault.

289
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,008
Okay. Then I'm gonn start
kicking air like this.

290
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,845
And if any part of you
should fill that air,

291
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,639
it's your own fault.

292
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,234
Hmm, I'd better go
check that out.

293
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:24,405
Now, Homer,
don't you eat this pie.

294
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,615
Okay.

295
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,076
All right, pie,
I'm just gonna do this.

296
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,289
And if you get eaten,
it's your own fault.

297
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,004
Oh... my!

298
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,087
The hell with it.

299
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,677
Stop it!
Stop it!

300
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,678
Stop it!
Stop it!

301
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,055
Stop it!

302
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,765
Mom, that is
really annoying.

303
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,851
- Bart started it.
- Nuh-uh, Lisa started it.

304
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,519
I don't care who started it.

305
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,788
I don't ever want
to see you two

306
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,480
fighting like that
ever again.

307
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,024
We love you both.

308
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,901
You're not in competition
with each other.

309
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,821
Repeat: You are not
in competition with each other.

310
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,740
Hey, Apu just called.

311
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,743
This Friday, Lisa's team
is playing Bart's team.

312
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,786
You're in direct
competition!

313
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,330
And don't go easy
on each other

314
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,807
just because you're
brother and sister.

315
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,207
I want to see
you both fighting

316
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,293
for your parents' love!

317
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,878
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

318
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,296
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

319
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,797
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

320
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,221
All right, I'm gonna make
a little deal with you mugs.

321
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,766
I'm gonna let you all out to see
my team play the hockey game

322
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,560
if you promise
to return to your cells.

323
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,897
Sorry, pig.
We can't make that promise.

324
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,858
All right. All right,
I'll sweeten the deal.

325
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,753
You can see the game,
you don't have to come back,

326
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:49,365
but you have to promise not
to commit any more crimes, okay?

327
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,533
- No.
- I'll take that as a yes.

328
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,037
All right!
We're free!

329
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,374
At 7:00 tonight,
the games begin.

330
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,168
Bart versus Lisa,
who will win?

331
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,879
Their father's fat,
and their mother's thin.

332
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,007
And Grandpa Simpson
reeks of gin.

333
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,842
Hey...

334
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,971
That's obsession for men.

335
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,181
Pass ketchup.

336
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,729
You'll have to do better
than that tonight, chump.

337
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,899
I asked for ketchup.

338
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,360
I'm eating salad here.

339
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,904
I won't have any aggressive
condiment passing in this house.

340
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,533
- Hello.
- Moe, what are you doing here?

341
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,744
What? What, a bartender
can't come by and say hi

342
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,828
to his best customer?

343
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,414
Hey, hey ya there, Midge.

344
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,499
Oh, gee, I like what you
done to your hair.

345
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,876
You caught me
at a real bad time, Moe.

346
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,187
I hope you understand
I'm too tense

347
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,504
to pretend I like you.

348
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,923
And how are
the little kids doing?

349
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,800
I mean, really
how are they doing?

350
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,677
Any disabling injuries?
Something, say,

351
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,054
that the gambling community
might not yet know about?

352
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,806
Come here,
let me see those knees.

353
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,182
Moe, I think
you should leave.

354
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,866
But, Blanche, you gotta
help me out here.

355
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,978
Please, I'm 64 grand
in the hole.

356
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,313
They're going to take my thumbs!

357
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,234
Charge!

358
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,155
Good luck tonight, sis.

359
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,115
I'll try not
to hurt you.

360
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,410
Don't worry. I'm wearing
my lucky rabbit's head.

361
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,037
Mr. Honeybunny!

362
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,705
You inhumane monster!

363
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,914
You want a piece of me?

364
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,959
Kids, stop it.

365
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,961
Conserve your precious
hatred for the game.

366
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,630
Now that we're all alone,
Marge, admit it.

367
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,966
- You like Lisa best.
- No.

368
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,152
Oh, so you're a Bart
woman, are you?

369
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,635
No.

370
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,155
Well, you can't possibly like
Maggie best.

371
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,057
What has she ever done?
Nothing for nobody.

372
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,934
Homer, we can't root for
one child over the other.

373
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,812
You wouldn't like it if the kids
played favorites with us.

374
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,606
Hey, Mom,
look at me, Mom.

375
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,399
Hi, Mom.
Over here.

376
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,400
Mom.

377
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,402
Hi, kids.

378
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,404
And now, to honor America,

379
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,157
here's Krusty the Clown.

380
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,036
O, say can you see

381
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,248
Da-da-da-da-da light.

382
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,043
What so proudly we...

383
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:11,006
Da-da...

384
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,550
I shouldn't have turned down
those cue cards.

385
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,772
I love Bart!

386
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,947
No, wait, I love Lisa!

387
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,741
Beer!
Oh, Marge, I love you.

388
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,727
He tripped my boy!

389
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,811
I demand vengeance!

390
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,106
I want vengeance!

391
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,484
Jimbo Jones
called for tripping.

392
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,529
The penalty shot will be
taken by Bart Simpson.

393
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,032
Oh, my God, Marge.

394
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,385
A penalty shot with
only four seconds left.

395
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,827
It's your child
versus mine.

396
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,620
The winner will be
showered with praise.

397
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,581
The loser will be
taunted and booed

398
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,457
until my throat is sore.

399
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,881
Kill her, boy!
Kill her!

400
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,675
Stop him dead, little girl.

401
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:40,053
Kill, Bart.
Kill, Bart. Kill, Bart...

402
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,098
Kill Bart. Kill Bart.
Kill Bart...

403
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,324
Great game, Lis.

404
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,825
Great game, Bart.

405
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,249
- Tie game?
- What the hell?

406
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,667
This is outrageous.

407
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,921
I've never been
so proud of them.

408
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,926
They're both losers.

409
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,219
Losers!

410
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,806
- Rip-off!
- We paid for blood.

411
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,808
Let's tear this place apart.

412
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,226
Good idea.

413
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:18,527
Those kids are, like, so sweet.

414
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,656
If only they had
had peewee hockey

415
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,907
when I was a lad.

416
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,868
Oh, well...
