00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,513
D'oh.

{\an8}"In this exciting strategy game,

00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:35,156
{\an8}you amass resources--
timber, salt fish and wax--

9
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,867
{\an8}Doges? Why do we have to play

10
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,247
{\an8}this stupid game Lisa likes?

11
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,003
{\an8}I don't like this game.
Nobody likes this game.

12
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,586
{\an8}Even the kids on the box look bored.

13
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,012
{\an8}They're miserable.

14
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,220
{\an8}We have to do something
until the storm passes.

15
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,472
{\an8}Now, just fill out these customs forms,

16
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,894
{\an8}and we can get started.

17
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,222
{\an8}(gasps) Twister!

18
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,597
{\an8}No! Whenever we play that,
my elbow touches Dad's junk.

19
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,895
{\an8}No! Outside the house!

20
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,862
{\an8}(all screaming)

21
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,071

{\an8}(grunting)

24
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,735
{\an8}Get in there.

25
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,408
{\an8}You live like this?

26
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,916
{\an8}Ooh, dear Lord,

27
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,578
{\an8}if thy tornado must take me,

28
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,246
{\an8}please let it take me to Oz.

29
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,835
{\an8}But don't let Flanders be the scarecrow.

30
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,922
{\an8}(gasps) We made it, boy.

31
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,887
{\an8}-(yelping)
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

32
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:37,258
{\an8}This counts as a walk!

33
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,099
{\an8}The tornado took old what's-his-name.
I'm going after him.

34
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,024
{\an8}No, Homie, it's too dangerous.

35
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,523
{\an8}(knocking on glass)

36
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,864
{\an8}Hey, Homer, we were just
doing a little storm chasing.

37
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,861
{\an8}Lenny, take us with you to find our dog.

38
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,573
{\an8}It's okay, Marge, they're professionals.

39
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,113
{\an8}What? 'Cause they rented a van

40
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,116
{\an8}and taped an antenna to the top?

41
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,948
{\an8}(scoffs) Not just any tape. Duct tape.

42
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,664
{\an8}Oh, all right.

43
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,874
{\an8}But I'm coming with you

44
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,624
{\an8}to make sure no one does anything stupid.

45
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,865
{\an8}Don't worry, Marge,
we bought a ton of safety gear

46
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,248
{\an8}from a highly-respected
storm chaser's widow.

47
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,915
{\an8}-(gasps)
-It's not what you're thinking.

48
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,554
{\an8}He died of a heart attack.

49
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,801
{\an8}Yeah, 80 feet up in the air.

50
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:17,393
{\an8}Behold, the awesome nonsense of nature.

51
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,099
{\an8}Okay, the tornado that took your dog

52
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:28,146
{\an8}looked like an F3 moving westerly.

53
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,321
{\an8}I guess you do know your weather.

54
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,320
{\an8}Ha! That means a lot coming from such
an attractive woman as you.

55
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,453
{\an8}I'd say she's prettier
than a surface hoar.

56
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,360
{\an8}Hey!

57
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:39,367
{\an8}Surely, you didn't misunderstand
my usage of "surface hoar."

58
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,250
{\an8}The sublimation of ice crystals
that's colder than a frost point.

59
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,288
{\an8}Maybe.

60
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,121
{\an8}Look, you guys obviously
know about weather,

61
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:50,587
{\an8}but I understand something
much more predictable: women.

62
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,170
{\an8}What women really want
is a guy who's confident enough

63
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,217
{\an8}to go completely downhill after marriage

64
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,301
{\an8}and know she'll still love him.

65
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,256
{\an8}I'll tell you what women really want:

66
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,346
{\an8}a man who can hold a note the longest.

67
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,522
{\an8}That is the stupidest...

68
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,930
{\an8}One, two, three, go.

69
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,148
{\an8}(all holding single note)

70
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,815
(all continue holding note)

71
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,284
Homer, you do not have to compete

72
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,034
with your friends for me.

73
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,326
I would never do that.

74
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,369
(resumes vocalizing)

75
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,163
-Enough with the singing.
-(all stop vocalizing)

76
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,246
Fine, but I swear,
I will win you back from Lenny.

77
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,213
'Nado!

78
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,631
Ooh.

79
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,261
It's like God's vacuum cleaner.

80
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,693
(laughing)

81
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,193
We're cutting it kind of close.

82
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,441
Not to worry-- we're safe in the van.

83
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,862
Anyone want their seat warmer?

84
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,198
(gasps) It's gone.

85
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,093
Help me, God.

86
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,669
What is it I'm paying you for
every Sunday?

87
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,375
(Marge screaming)

88
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,175
Can... always use...

89
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,524
a good babysitter.

90
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,229
I was just 27 years from retirement!

91
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,811
Oh, my God, the twister got Carl,

92
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,857
my best friend in the world.

93
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,401
I can barely remember what he looks like.

94
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,025
He was a black guy,

95
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,112
but his voice sounded like a white guy.

96
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,157
Hey, excuse me for wanting to fit in.

97
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,951
And here comes Santa's Little Helper.

98
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,536
Homie, we made it.

99
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,035
(both scream)

100
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,167
Oh, my God.

101
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,463
NELSON: Ha ha!

102
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,046
You're trapped in there good.

103
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,721
Once again, the big banks
stick it to the little guy.

104
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,180
-(both grunting)
-Come on.

105
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,432
Are you pushing?

106
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,223
Yes, it won't give.

107
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,887
(sighs)

108
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,185
I don't know if we're going
to be able to get out.

109
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,019
(squeaking)

110
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,274
What are you writing?

111
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,725
Maybe the last words I'll ever write.

112
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,896
Oh.

113
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,445
Lenny, you calling for help?

114
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,318
Let them have their moment.

115
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,617
{\an8}Kent Brockman here
at death's revolving door.

116
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,254
{\an8}Police have arrived on the scene

117
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,881
{\an8}after having fled the state
at the first sign of the storm.

118
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,245
Bulletproof, as I somewhat suspected.

119
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,628
But don't you worry,

120
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,054
we're having a very expensive crane

121
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,433
brought in from Shelbyville.

122
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,050
What is this, a bird?

123
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,807
It's a bird known as a crane.

124
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,269
And it got very sick on the way over.

125
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,230
Well, our top priority

126
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,980
is making sure that bird gets well.

127
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,482
Hey! Hello!

128
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,114
As for you, your only hope

129
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,741
is this glass cutting guy
from the hardware store.

130
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,898
You guys want to come out
in a plain circle

131
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,487
or a kind of a rosette shape?

132
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,622
Just cut the glass.

133
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,619
Everybody wants it done
yesterday. (chuckles)

134
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,292
(groans)

135
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,161
WIGGUM: Uh, now we're ordering some lunch.

136
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,287
Uh, want to go halfsies on a pizza?

137
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,245
FYI, that means you get one slice.

138
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,085
Okay, wise guy, you get to pull out

139
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,050
the two corpses when we're done.

140
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,675
Except for the face full of glass

141
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,469
when the door finally collapsed,

142
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,642
he did a pretty good job.

143
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,181
Found another one.

144
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,478
It was so scary thinking something

145
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,139
might happen to you guys.

146
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,567
Mom, I am so glad you're alive.

147
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,150
Were you worried about me, boy?

148
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,605
Sure. Why not?

149
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,364
(stammers angrily)

150
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,696
Clearly, the boy's in shock.

151
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,532
(chuckling) Oh, yeah, I'm a wreck.

152
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,407
-Stop being blasé.
-Never!

153
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,374
Now, I know you kids
are scared by what happened,

154
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,075
but it's bedtime.

155
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,495
Just go into your dark rooms
and shut your eyes.

156
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,294
(kids groaning)

157
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,588
Homie, if we did both die,

158
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,552
we've never named guardians.

159
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,882
The kids could end up wards of the state.

160
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,008
-Connecticut?
-No, our state.

161
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,846
(screams) Okay, you're right.

162
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,731
It's hard to imagine
anyone else bringing up our kids,

163
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,979
but I think the choice is obvious:

164
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,601
my dad.

165
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,648
Oh, you'd let me have another chance

166
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,492
after the way I screwed
things up with you?

167
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,609
Eh, good point.

168
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,945
We'll find somebody else.

169
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,869
Yep, you're a big bag of blubber

170
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,489
soaked in worthless juice.

171
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,446
I got it, Dad.

172
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,116
Why I married you I'll never know.

173
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,495
Oh, yeah?

174
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,382
The tornado was more of a father
to me than you.

175
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,789
Okay, how about my brother?
He's rich.

176
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,473
(beep)

177
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,878
<i>Hi. You've reach Herb Powell.</i>

178
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,296
<i>I'm poor again.</i>

179
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,554
(startled grunt)

180
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,465
There's really only one choice,

181
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,644
or should I say two identical choices?

182
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,274
Sugar?

183
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,480
Oh, how very kind of you.

184
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,611
I'm not giving our kids
to these gravelly-voiced super hags.

185
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,109
One lump, please.

186
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,071
Homer, my sisters adopted Ling,
and she's doing great.

187
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,322
We've been tiger-mothering her.

188
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,744
Ling, music time.

189
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,822
♪♪

190
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,448
Ling, floor routine.

191
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,827
More syncopated. Stick the landing!

192
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,705
And no resenting us ever.

193
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,881
That's some impressive flute-nastics.

194
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,840
Shut up! You can't praise her.

195
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,671
She'll think she's smart and slack off.

196
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,466
Then all our loving would be for nothing.

197
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,552
Mmm, maybe we'd better go.

198
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,768
Didn't you want to ask us something?

199
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,348
Good-bye forever.

200
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,683
(whispering) Help me.

201
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,808
I think it's time to go off family.

202
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,686
KIRK: Luanne and I have gone
through some rough patches,

203
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:48,364
so to be seen as stable enough
to raise your kids, well,

204
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,904
it would be an honor.

205
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,987
You know what else
would be an honor?

206
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,743
Having a husband who asks my opinion

207
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,905
before inviting in
three more mouths he can't feed.

208
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,495
Hey, Luanne, you always asked me

209
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,670
what I saw in Vicky at the Walgreens.

210
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,499
Well, I'll tell you what I saw: not you!

211
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,545
You told me
you didn't even know her name.

212
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,050
Well, that's her name, okay?

213
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,381
BRANDINE: Let me get this straight.

214
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,426
We have 17 kids, and you want us

215
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,720
to take three more?

216
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,473
Anything new that wanders into this house
winds up in the stew pot.

217
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,141
Hey, I'm so sorry,
but we just adopted a baby.

218
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,518
Give me back my pants.

219
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,984
I've got to get back to my unit.

220
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,944
Someone's cranky.

221
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,824
All right, Marge,
maybe we're being a little too choosy

222
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,662
about who our kids
spend the rest of their lives with.

223
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,198
We'll take what we can get.

224
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,372
(gasping)

225
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,367
Uh-oh.
I wonder if word has gotten out

226
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,624
that we're looking for guardians.

227
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,014
(grunts, growls)

228
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,425
Ah!

229
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,089
Go! Go!

230
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,604
(tires squealing)

231
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,430
(beeping)

232
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,976
(people screaming)

233
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,561
(people screaming)

234
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:10,111
(people screaming)

235
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,279
(dog howling)

236
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,072
(people screaming)

237
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,115
(hums, grunts)

238
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,253
(Dr. Hibbert chuckling)

239
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,211
(airplane flying overhead)

240
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,626
All right, the coast is clear.

241
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,925
(relieved murmuring)

242
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,345
Wait a minute, I live here. Aw.

243
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,484
-Where are we going?
-And why are we wearing our good clothes?

244
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,147
With name tags on them.

245
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
Kids, there's nothing to worry about.

246
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,236
(walrus barking)

247
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,331
But we're looking at replacements
for your mom and me

248
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,372
if we should fail
to die together as a family.

249
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,327
Oh, I see.
You guys are trying to find

250
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,457
a couple of saps to take us

251
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,503
when Dad has a coronary
in the dead of night,

252
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,087
rolls over and crushes Mom.

253
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,512
This is not that,

254
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,220
and that smart-alecky attitude

255
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,260
is exactly why no one wants you.

256
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,104
Homer, dual incomes, no kids at 2:00.

257
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,930
(gasps) Ooh.

258
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,813
Okay, I'll nudge them with the car.

259
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,523
We'll get a whole "meet cute" thing going.

260
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:30,819
(gasping)

261
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,438
Aah! What the hell are you doing?

262
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,105
Keith, relax.

263
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,703
Look at those adorable children.

264
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,619
Hmm, I think I hear a slight accent.

265
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,949
Mid-Atlantic.

266
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,203
(gasps)
That's where they filmed <i>The Wire!</i>

267
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,115
-Step on it!
-(tires squealing)

268
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,455
This is a pretty important decision.

269
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,961
How about asking that Japanese guy

270
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,922
who set the world record
for eating hot dogs?

271
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,842
He's like a successful version of Dad.

272
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,301
(groans)

273
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,301
Maybe we should just give up for now,

274
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,393
have some fried clams
and collect sea glass.

275
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,599
Wait, what about that couple?

276
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,390
They look pretty cozy.

277
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,563
That's Moe and a bag of garbage.

278
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,812
-Boy, cats sure breed a lot.
-(meowing)

279
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,734
(yells)

280
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:11,983
Why would you do that to me

281
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,904
after I thought about feeding you?

282
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,363
(grunts) Mmm.

283
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,612
(laughing)

284
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,117
Whoa, look at that guy.

285
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,179
Yo, I'm Mav.

286
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,888
Wow, a man's stomach can be flat?

287
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,799
It's one of the, like,
awesome side effects

288
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,558
of being a pro surfer.

289
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,019
Wow.

290
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,229
Someone's smitten.

291
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,350
Whoa, way to shralp the crispies, babe.

292
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,767
My wife, Portia.

293
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,975
Another surfer?

294
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,524
Environmental lawyer.

295
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,608
(sighing)

296
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,743
And in my free time,
I prosecute record companies

297
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,950
who withhold royalties
from elderly blues musicians.

298
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,701
(sighing continues)

299
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,283
(grunting)

300
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,753
Um, why don't we discuss it over dinner?

301
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,752
Discuss what?

302
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,133
Things that you're desperately missing

303
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,050
from your life
that you never knew you needed.

304
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,668
Cool. See you at 6:00.

305
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,545
(birds cawing)

306
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,802
So, surfing is really your job?

307
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,385
Yeah, I earned a couple million
on the tour last year.

308
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,311
Just for standing on a thing?

309
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:31,139
Mmm. Wow.

310
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,097
Your house is perfect.

311
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,477
No sharp corners,

312
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,363
no unsafe balconies, a cool grandpa.

313
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,781
I love two things:

314
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,819
shutting up and giving away money.

315
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,823
Ooh, thanks, Dad.

316
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,736
What's that stone around your neck?

317
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,025
It's a promise stone.

318
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,157
It signifies that
if I ever get to be a burden,

319
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,695
I just jump in a volcano.

320
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,078
Wow.

321
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,544
I assumed the Jackson Five
were the only perfect family,

322
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,916
but now I see there's another.

323
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,093
Princeton, B.A., Oxford, M.A.

324
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,473
I smell a Rhodes.

325
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,800
No, I turned it down

326
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,764
because Cecil Rhodes was such a racist.

327
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,425
(sighs)

328
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,223
Uh, say, listen, Portia.

329
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,886
How would you and Mav feel about...

330
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,056
um, swinging?

331
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,774
Uh, with you guys?

332
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,305
Uh, seems like my husband

333
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,068
would be getting
the much better deal.

334
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,319
No, no, no.

335
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,531
I-I meant pushing kids on swings.

336
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,701
Give me a minute to get
some images out of my mind.

337
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,820
Okay, take whatever time you need.

338
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:30,447
I just want to know if you'd
like to be their guardians.

339
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,326
Wow. Wow, that's quite an offer.

340
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,124
This is so fast.

341
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,537
It's so hard to get to know a child
after just one day. I...

342
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,167
All you need to know
is I'm a politeness monster

343
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,665
who eats please
and farts thank-yous, ma'am.

344
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:47,297
I'm exactly the kind of kid
he's pretending to be.

345
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,811
(belches)

346
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,140
Hmm.

347
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,564
Babe, when a killer wave hits,
you can't spend your whole life

348
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,523
deciding if you want to drop in or not.

349
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,274
It just might be the most
righteous tube we ever shot.

350
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,526
Man, you sure can talk surfer talk.

351
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,950
Okay, we'll give some serious
thought to taking them.

352
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,779
Maybe this will help you
make up your mind.

353
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,526
It's empty.

354
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,658
You never know when you
might want to mail something.

355
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,209
Homie,

356
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,921
it's been a wonderful day,

357
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,752
but do you think maybe we're moving

358
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,587
a little too quickly?

359
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,222
Worrywart Marge.

360
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,889
You don't look a Trojan horse
in the mouth.

361
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,718
(laughter)

362
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,974
But we know so little about them.

363
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,597
I swear to you, Marge,

364
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,603
when I have the time,
I will Google them both.

365
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,943
It's all good, brah.

366
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,935
Hey, where's Bart?

367
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,447
Oh, uh, well, he wanted to be here,

368
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,819
but I'm going to decrease
the volume of my voice

369
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,987
and mumble so you can't really
understand what I'm saying,

370
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,866
and I'll just keep doing it
until the subject...

371
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,003
Your father says I need to keep you lashed

372
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,580
to the mast for five more arrrs.

373
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:02,086
-Is that arrrs or hours?
-Both.

374
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,549
Great.

375
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,259
And now my dad can notarize.

376
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,759
I still have my uses.

377
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,431
Mm-hmm.

378
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,850
-Name another.
-(groans)

379
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,009
Well, I must admit

380
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,428
it's a relief to get that taken care of.

381
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,807
Now I can finally complete my bucket list.

382
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,435
(chuckles)

383
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,772
Homer, Marge,

384
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,227
we have a favor to ask.

385
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,027
Too late! You already signed!

386
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,321
Oh, wait, there's one more.

387
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,407
Suckers!

388
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,492
Oh, wait, you've got to initial this.

389
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,582
Checkmate.

390
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,374
(chuckles) Listen, Homer,

391
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,207
we just wanted to know
if we could borrow the kids

392
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,592
for a weekend at our ski house.

393
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,379
We thought they could
pick out their bedrooms.

394
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,962
A whole weekend?

395
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,297
I don't know.

396
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,762
Hey, if they can watch them
for the rest of their lives,

397
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,803
they can certainly do it
for a weekend.

398
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,006
I guess.

399
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,136
As long as we don't make it a habit.

400
00:16:56,223 --> 00:17:00,273
Marge, no indulgence of mine
ever becomes a habit.

401
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,941
Do you have to do that in front of people?

402
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,527
It helps me write.

403
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,951
<i>♪ Just the two of us ♪</i>

404
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,741
<i>♪ We can make it if we try ♪</i>

405
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,945
<i>♪ Just the two of us ♪</i>

406
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,616
{\an8}<i>♪ Just the two of us ♪</i>

407
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,035
Marge, this has been great couples time.

408
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:26,344
The one thing people with kids
desperately need is no kids.

409
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,960
Well, at least we have time

410
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,967
to get the pets' Christmas presents.

411
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,219
I don't like the way
they just rip the paper off.

412
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,641
Santa's Little Helper, my ass.

413
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,890
(gasps)

414
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,261
Hmm?

415
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,767
(gasps)

416
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,649
My God.

417
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,689
They want to steal our kids.

418
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,073
No one steals my kids,

419
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,530
except me, from that theme park jail

420
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,911
that I never told you about,
except I guess I just did.

421
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,528
We're all caught up now. Let's go.

422
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,459
MARGE: It all makes sense now.

423
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,118
That's why they took our kids so quick.

424
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,788
Like all childless couples,

425
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,916
they troll the beaches waiting
for the egg-layers

426
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,173
to wander off from their young.

427
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,665
She's gonna raise three kids

428
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,627
without wrecking that perfect figure.

429
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,137
Oh, yeah, man.

430
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,389
-(groans)
-Don't worry, Marge.

431
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,811
We'll get them.

432
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,769
Unless we die on this icy mountain road.

433
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,729
Then they've won forever.

434
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,230
Homie, I just had a horrible thought.

435
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,402
(chuckles)

436
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,520
Women and their horrible thoughts.

437
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,397
What if they <i>are</i> better
for the kids than us?

438
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,565
Marge, let me set your mind
straight about something.

439
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,364
That spectacular young couple

440
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,737
is definitely better for the kids,

441
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,945
but those kids are ours,

442
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,945
because we made them

443
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,157
by accident.

444
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,957
And now we're gonna take them back

445
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,330
because we love them,

446
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,746
especially now that we've had
a little time apart from them.

447
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,996
-(crashing)
-(Marge groans)

448
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,588
I've got a bone to pick with you.

449
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,394
Then an apology to make.

450
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,638
Then we exchange insurance information.

451
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,270
Then more bone picking.

452
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,939
Homer, Marge, I understand your anger,

453
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,148
but your kids are more awesome

454
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,109
than the breaks at Waimea.

455
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,859
Those better be good breaks.

456
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,032
Honestly, we fell in love with them,

457
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:17,031
and it just seemed like you guys
didn't really want them.

458
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,784
Sure, you wanted the fun parts,
but do you want to go

459
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,537
to their little league games
and recitals?

460
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,959
-We totally have.
-Like clockwork.

461
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,668
Well, I'm glad someone has.

462
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,748
Look, before anyone says anything else,

463
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,174
how could you possibly think
you could get our kids?

464
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,964
It happens more than you know, Marge.

465
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,667
I'm a lawyer; he's a surfer.

466
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,887
That combination's pretty unstoppable.

467
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:38,968
BART: Well, I'm afraid

468
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,222
that we don't want to be
with anyone but Mom

469
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,965
and whoever she chooses to be with.

470
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,306
Portia, you're the woman
I dream of becoming,

471
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,022
but Mom is my mom.

472
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,442
Fine, but you're leaving a gap
in our lives

473
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,151
that can only be filled
by foreign travel,

474
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,031
sleeping late and gourmet food.

475
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,228
You guys lock up.

476
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,688
We're going to Bali.

477
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,237
(groans) Again.

478
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,611
We've won!

479
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,867
(flatly) Whoo-hoo.

480
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,289
Kids, your father and I have decided

481
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,459
we're not in such a hurry
to get you guardians.

482
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,289
Instead of concentrating on dying,

483
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,214
we're going to concentrate on living.

484
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,674
If you call this living.

485
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,424
-Why, you little...
-(choking, grunting)

486
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,586
I do call this living.

487
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:22,595
Living the way kids in India
can only dream of.

488
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,639
There is nothing like
your biological family.
