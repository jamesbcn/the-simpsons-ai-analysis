00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,934

{\an8}just made the cover of

{\an8}I know that's a zing, but still...
the cover!

{\an8}Now, you listen to me, Bart.

67

{\an8}Milhouse may not be the perfect date.

00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,826
{\an8}At least I'm with someone
who tries a little too hard

71
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,754
{\an8}because he really likes me.

72
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,842
{\an8}Hey, plenty of babes have docked
in Porta de Barto.

73
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,839
{\an8}Yeah, for about a week.

74
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,631
{\an8}But as soon as they
get to know the real you,

75
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,804
{\an8}they departo de Barto.

76
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,553
{\an8}That's why you're alone tonight.

77
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,931

78
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,984

{\an8}Oh! What's my other
inflatable doll doing here?

81
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,068
What? What?

82
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,071
I ain't here with no one.

83
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,288
Oh, man, Lisa's right.

84
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,463
None of these relationships
lasted very long.

85
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,792
Three days. One recess.

86
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,417
Half a field trip.

87
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,974
Why did I have to get so needy
at the planetarium?

88
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,138
Boy, if anyone needs me,
I'll be taking a popcorn bath.

89
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,388
It's a thing I read about in
a <i>Men's Health</i> magazine

90
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,560
in a dream.

91
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,638
Dad, can I ask you a question?

92
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,484
How did you ever get a woman
like Mom to stay with you?

93
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,060
(scoffs) Look in the mirror,
unplanned miracle.

94
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,646
Is that the only reason?

95
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,441
Well, I also keep things interesting.

96
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,565
MARGE:
All right, who took the microwave?

97
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,992
(laughing) You see?

98
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,820
Hey, what are you looking at?

99
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,275
My ex-girlfriends.

100
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,405
Aw, boy, I feel for you.

101
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,872
Nobody likes to be rejected,

102
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,712
and it never gets easier,
until you can drink.

103
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,868
Because then you can express
your unfiltered feelings

104
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,787
by drunk dialing.

105
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,046
Observe.
(slurring) Hey, it's me again.

106
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,338
He's there, isn't he?

107
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,052
Well, I hope this doesn't sound weird,

108
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,052
but I'm inside your closet.

109
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,644
Um, that's awesome, but I think
I'll visit my ex-girlfriends

110
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,681
and prove they still like me.

111
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,885

It's your birthday in like,
three, four months?

115
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,358
Would it be weird
if I threw you a party?

116
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,404
(knocking)

117
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,454

118
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,821
Drop dead.

119
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,738
Eat fist, jerk.

120
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,707
You've got a lot of nerve
showing up here...

121
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,959
and not giving me a kiss.

122
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,711
Inappropriate!

123
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:17,883
I miss you.

124
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,550
Stalker!

125
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,419

(rooster crowing)

127
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,795
Mary Spuckler,

128
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,465
you're my last chance.

129
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,393
She's pretty cute for Cletus's daughter.

130
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,853
Yeah, she liked to drink milk
as a kid instead of white paint.

131
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,599
Is you one of my kids?

132
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,807
No, sir.

133
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,977
Prove it.

134
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,065
A, B, C...

135
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,149
All right. All right.

136
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,994
You convinced me, Einstein.

137
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,109
-What you want?
-Is Mary here?

138
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,406
I'm afraid Mary done run off.

139
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,370
We knows not where.

140
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,870
Dadgummit.
Do you think she still likes me?

141
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,003
Um, hey, Brandine!

142
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,500
Does Mary still like this boy?

143
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,292
I don't know
what that girl likes anymore.

144
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,207
She ran away after we engaged
her to Old Man Wellbottom.

145
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,796
WELLBOTTOM: And I was gonna be
a good husband, too!

146
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,882
If'n I ever get out of this well.

147
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,008
All right. All right now.

148
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,505
-That's enough out of you.
-WELLBOTTOM: But I just--

149
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,350
Oh, I can't believe she ran away.

150
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,975
And this isn't helping.

151
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,771
I better switch to the hard stuff.

152
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,105
Hey, Dubya.

153
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,399
I know where my sister run off to.

154
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,033
New York City.

155
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,360
New York?

156
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,315
That's where Sesame Street is.

157
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,575
Do you ever wonder what happens
to Oscar on garbage day?

158
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,908
Yup, New York.

159
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,544
The big something.

160
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,830
This here's her address.

161
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,003
Good luck!

162
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,546
<i>I don't know if we</i>

163

167
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,977
Mom, can we go to New York
to find this girl I used to know?

168
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,986
Bart, that's sweet,

169
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,528
but we'd need
airplane money, hotel money...

170
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,913
And $500 for Yankee tickets,
which turn out to be bogus.

171
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,621
Well, don't buy 'em.

172
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,621
But they're playing the Purple Sox.

173
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,663
Come on, Dad, you love New York.

174
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,997
Now, that your two
least favorite buildings

175
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,252
have been obliterated:
Old Penn Station and Shea Stadium.

176
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,495
Lousy, outdated relics!

177
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:28,087
Boy, do you remember what happened
the last time we went to New York?

178
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,184
(cool jazz playing)

179
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,887
Keep your meat hooks off
my sister Marge or my goons

180
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,353
will do a soft shoe on your solar plexus.

181
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,603
You're dead, J.J. Get yourself buried.

182
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,555
Tough cookie, huh?
Well, watch me take a bite out of ya.

183
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,686
I'm about to go owl shooting,
and you just said who.

184
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,273
That's some lip you got on you.

185
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,688
How'd you like me to stretch it like a
rubber band and snap you into last week?

186
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:51,237
You're selling milk, J.J.,
and I got a sour stomach.

187
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,576
Homer, that sounds like
<i>The Sweet Smell of Success.</i>

188
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,451
It didn't feel like success.

189
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,884
Why, ladies? Why?!

190
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,802
Son, you can dial down the crazy.

191
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,091
Your mother and I talked about it,

192
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,224
and we found a way to get to New York.

193
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,931
It's all set, boy.

194
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,811
To save money, we're swapping houses.

195
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,479
But don't the people wreck
your house when they stay in it?

196
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,439
I didn't say I swapped <i>our</i> house.

197
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,110
Yeah, how ya doing?
We're staying here for two weeks.

198
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,529
Lord, you're testing me, aren't you?

199
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,898
Yeah, keep talking
to your friend up there.

200
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,315
We'll be doing it on your bed.

201
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,033
New York style.

202
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,836
Look at this place.

203
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,088
Things have certainly changed

204
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,669
since our ancestor Fievel came here.

205
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,335
Fievel was a mouse in a movie.

206
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,474
Yes, and now look at us.

207
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,051
Only in America.

208
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,716
MAN:
Khlav Kalash! Get your Khlav Kalash!

209
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,055
Oh, geez, not this guy
with his stupid little pushcart.

210
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,062
50,000 square feet, huh?
All Khlav Kalash!

211
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,185
Used to be bookstore. (laughs)

212
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,402
Books.

213
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:11,031
Come on, let's go find Mary.
This is the address her brother gave me.

214
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,700
Can't Dad take Bart
while we seek out culture?

215
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,319
You do that.

216
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,156
Do you know you're missing your clothes?

217
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,702
I thought this was just a dream.

218
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,445
Oh, man!

219
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,957
All right, I'll spring for a cab.

220
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,298
Much better.

221
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,391
CABBIE: Here we are.

222
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,059
Anything you leave in a cab
you'll never see again.

223
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,478
(snoring quietly)

224
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:44,944
Hey!

225
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,649
Oh, uh, oh, thank God you woke up.

226
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,154
(doorbell buzzing)

227
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,321
Oh, I guess my search
for true love is doomed.

228
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,815
You've learned a very
valuable life lesson, boy.

229
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,988
Which is that love doesn't exist,

230
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,577
except briefly between a man
and a woman before marriage.

231
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,754
After that, it's just hanging out
with someone who kind of

232
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,593
hates you but you can't get it
together to leave.

233
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,260
I'll get us some ice cream.

234
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,473
What's the matter, darling?

235
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,431
Thanks for asking, Duchess.

236
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,432
I'm sitting here waiting for
a girl that's never gonna show up.

237
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,015
-What makes you so sure?
-Girls don't like me.

238
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,561
I don't really like them yet either,
but I think I'm gonna.

239
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,435
There's a storm a-brewing down there.

240
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,072
Well, there's a girl
a-standin' right here.

241
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,439
It's me, Mary.

242
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,106
Wow, what are you doing for money?

243
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,615
Well, it's not very steady,
and I'm kind of ashamed.

244
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,779
I'm a featured player
on <i>Saturday Night Live.</i>

245
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,537
<i>DON PARDO: Mary Spuckler!</i>

246
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,330
Aw, I'm lying.

247
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,424
My whole life here is a bunch of lies.

248
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,539
I'm just a writer
with a performing option.

249
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,126
Let's talk about something else.

250
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,262
Something nice.

251
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,587
So, this is basically what we can afford.

252
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,678
Okay, second balcony,
partially obstructed view,

253
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,814
no bathroom privileges,
and you must stipulate that,

254
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,141
in emergencies,
you can change a spotlight gel.

255
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,147
Well, at least I'll be able to say
I went to a Broadway show.

256
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,520
You're not allowed to say that.

257
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,396
Oh, forget it.

258
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,903
So, Bart Simpson, did you really come

259
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,857
all the way here just to see me?

260
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,817
Yeah. Plus, I thought I might get

261
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,527
to see an air conditioner
fall on someone's head.

262
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,867
But I guess that never really...

263
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,162
HOMER: D'oh! Ow!

264
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,955
-Is that your father?
-HOMER: What was that?

265
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,748
Bart, I want to see you again,

266
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,082
but I don't want
a grownup taking me back.

267
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,708
Meet me at the high line tomorrow.

268
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,585
Keep my secret!

269
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,342
You little!

270
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,264
Where's that ice cream?!

271
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,262
Just once, I'd like your father

272
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,564
to be on a jumbotron for something good.

273
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,598
<i>HOMER:</i>
<i>Damn you and your fluted neck!</i>

274
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,356
So, what did you do with your dad?

275
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,150
We're safe because you have
to climb steps to get up here.

276
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,114
(Homer groans)

277
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,905
-Can't move?
-No.

278
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,874
I thought there was no crime
in New York anymore.

279
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,581
Giuliani!

280
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,622
Gimme some news of Springfield.

281
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,576
They let Sideshow Bob
out of prison again.

282
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,416
(train horn blows)

283
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,132
Huh, didn't know they
still ran those trains.

284
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,763
How's your momma and your sister?

285
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,839
Trying to find high culture
at low prices.

286
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,505
No, Lisa!

287
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,723
If you click that turnstile,
it'll blow our budget!

288
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,345
-Aah!
-Whaah!

289
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,931
Well, without them around,

290
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,387
you and I can walk through
the city holding hands,

291
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,898
just like the menfolk do.

292
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,769
I could listen to your twang all day.

293
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,646
Would you care to hear it in song?

294
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,113
'Cause I wrote one 'bout you.

295
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,693
Can I do a rap in the middle of it?

296
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,488
Or you could just listen.

297
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,664
Sir, may I borrow your guitar?

298
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,991
Sure, sure. It's the case
that makes money.

I really like you, Bart Simpson.

315
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,431
-I've come to take you back, Mary.
-Daddy?

316
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:52,772
Sorry, honey, your mother misses you,
but she just can't say it.

317
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,310
That's 'cause the donkey busted her jaw.

318
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,864
She'll be fine. Your mother too.

319
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,902
All right, Broadway's too expensive,

320
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,697
the museums are over-curated,

321
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,450
but Shakespeare in the Park is tonight

322
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,992
and the tickets are free.

323
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,384
(sighs)

324
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,879
Get your cuckold's horns,
neck ruffles, Yorik skulls!

325
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,757
I'll take a cuckold's horn!

326
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,562
It works!

327
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,892
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have an announcement.

328
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:40,557
Lad-ies and gen-tle-men,
I have an an-nounce-ment--

329
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,148
(gasps) That's not iambic pentameter!

330
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,573
I'm afraid that tonight's
show has been cancelled.

331
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,283
-Why?
-Wherefore?

332
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,533
The Baldwin brothers, who were,
uh, playing the Montague family

333
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,446
and the Sheen/Estevez clan,
our Capulets, have quit the production.

334
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,035
You guys suck at acting and you
ate all the potato salad.

335
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,751
No, you suck at acting
and it's first come, first serve!

336
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,212
I made that potato salad!

337
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,882
Well, uh, idiot, it says
Zaybar's on the package!

338
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,512
He works at Zaybar's.

339
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,008
We all work at Zaybar's.

340
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,970
I'm so sorry.

341
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,470
You came to see <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>
not feuding families.

342
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,432
Uh, the long, slow line to leave
the theatre forms on the left.

343
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,974
(crowd grumbling)

344
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,637
Aw, and we have to walk by a drum circle!

345
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,359
Faster, man! More annoying!

346
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,398
Not so fast!

347
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,112
We came for Shakespeare
and we're gonna see Shakespeare.

348
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,863
Anyone who wants to be in this,

349
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,985
grab a doublet and meet me backstage!

350
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,832
Is there, mayhaps,
a bit of business for me?

351
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,908
I was thinking amateurs only.

352
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,964
Well,
my only professional job was playing

353
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,868
a nefarious hot dog
in an ad for Taco Bueno.

354
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,038
(sniffs)
You fresh-made tacos will never

355
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,838
defeat pre-boiled hot dogs!

356
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,131
(laughing)

357
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:51,264
Please, I owe Yale Drama School $200,000.

358
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,973
-They keep calling my mother.
-Fine! You're in.

359
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,774
I must warn you,
I have crippling stage fright.

360
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,639
Oh, for the love of God!

361
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,307
MARGE:
For never was a story of more woe

362
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,398
than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

363
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,414
Our search for culture is thus concluded,

364
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,238
For the Bard of Avon is well suited

365
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,914
to a crowd with every cell phone muted.

366
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,664
Geez, I can't stop talking like this.

367
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,287
Hey, don't ever stop!

368
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,043
Because, tonight,
we made it in New York.

369
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,996
Those the people
who took over the theatre?

370
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:29,046
Pepper spray and power wash--
the New York hug and kiss.

371
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,921
(Marge screams)

372
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,180
Now, Mary, you listen to me.

373
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,845
I'm one-third your father,
and you're gonna come back.

374
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,354
If y'all will excuse me,

375
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,976
I gotta freshen up for the ride home.

376
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:49,034
Enjoy your fancy-schmancy
in-house for the last time.

377
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,283
Psst!

378
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,952
-Um, I've got to go.
-Go where?

379
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,032
Uh, well, since we're here,

380
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,117
I'm gonna go try to get
Al Roker's autograph.

381
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,713
Here you go, little fan.
Killer storm on the way.

382
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,000
(nervous laugh)
Um, I gonna go try to sell this.

383
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,375
I'll buy it back.

384
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,381
(groans)

385
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,467
Goodbye, Bart, and don't worry,

386
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,220
there'll be other Mary Spucklers,

387
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:19,852
including my sisters Mary Zeke
and Mary Not Quite Right.

388
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,312
CROWD: Aw!

389
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,440
(train horn blows)

390
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,573
Bart, if any girl tries
to fix you, let 'em,

391
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,691
because you got a couple
of big problems.

392
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,068
But mostly, you're great!

393
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,584
-Boy, you tell me where Mary's gone!
-I can't.

394
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:46,383
Boy, you squeal like a piggy
for the hillbilly man.

395
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,588
I can't because Mary's the girl
that proves that girls can like me.

396
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,800
And she wouldn't like me
anymore if I gave her up.

397
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,800
So I won't, even if you torture me
like you do the English language.

398
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,683
Well, if that ain't aren't the isn't.

399
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:02,061
(sighs) I guess I just gotta let Mary
find her own way.

400
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,891
Come on, let's head on back
to Springfield.

401
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,807
Uh, one on-getter
for the clickity clack, please.

402
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,817
You miss her, don't you, son?

403
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,657
You want a picture of her
for your wallet?

404
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:23,161
Oh, she's somewhere in B-3.

405
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,245
Thanks, man.

406
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,040
Aw, look at that.

407
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,594
My little guy's finally realizing

408
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,708
how complicated
grownup feelings can be.

409
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,716
Well, at least it didn't end
as bad as <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

410
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,589
No kidding. I saw your reviews.

411
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,257
-(snickering)
-Hey!

412
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,845
I specifically said no critics!

413
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,720
This is outrageous!

414
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,097
(gasps)
Ooh, but they like me.

415
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,942
I hope you enjoyed the show tonight.

416
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,107
And if you're worried about
when the air conditioner

417
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,276
fell on my head,
rest assured it was a stunt man,

418
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,285
and his family is being
well taken care of.

419
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:07,158
But we're here to ask if you
have an idea for a couch gag.

420
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,997
The best submission will be
animated and appear on the show.

421
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,293
Do we screw them on the credit?

422
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:16,797
No! For details,
log on to TheSimpsons.com.

423
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,222
I'm submitting mine now.

424
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,547
(all laughing)

425
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,938
