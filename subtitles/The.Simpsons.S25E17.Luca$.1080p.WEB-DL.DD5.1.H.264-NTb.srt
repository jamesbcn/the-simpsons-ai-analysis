H-Hey, what?

Oh! Oh, cleats!

12
00:00:56,703 --> 00:00:58,676
(sighs)
Homie, what happened?

13
00:00:59,671 --> 00:01:02,617
Uh... maybe some
easy-listening music

14
00:01:02,623 --> 00:01:04,777
will make you feel
better about the story.

15
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,690
Turn on 89.9.

17
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:08,690
(easy listening music playing)

18
00:01:08,716 --> 00:01:12,363
Like most of my problems,
it all started at Moe's...

19
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:16,661
CARL: All right, so the rules are every
time the news guy says "senator,"

20
00:01:16,688 --> 00:01:18,075
we got to take a drink.

21
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:21,601
Huh. It'll be nice to let someone else
decide when I drink... too much pressure.

22
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:23,045
(new theme playing)

23
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:24,748
(quietly): Uh, yeah,
Channel Six tip line?

24
00:01:24,761 --> 00:01:27,428
I just caught two senators
doin' it in the alley.

25
00:01:27,448 --> 00:01:29,661
And me?
I'm just a reliable source.

26
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:31,548
Not "sauce," "source."

27
00:01:31,563 --> 00:01:34,123
Source! S-A-U-R-C-E!

28
00:01:34,163 --> 00:01:37,450
We have heard from a
very reliable sauce

29
00:01:37,482 --> 00:01:39,690
news involving
multiple senators.

30
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,479
I'm going to read a
list of senators,

31
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:44,026
with possibly more
senators to be named later

32
00:01:44,046 --> 00:01:46,645
by other senators:
Senator Abercrombie,

33
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:49,222
Senator Billingsley,
Senator Beaumont...

34
00:01:50,827 --> 00:01:52,239
(snickers)

35
00:01:52,257 --> 00:01:55,077
Hmm? Oh, damn, the
plaster's flaking again.

36
00:01:56,476 --> 00:01:58,516
HOMER: <i>Once intoxicated,
we had a great idea.</i>

37
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:00,297
Hey! Swings!

38
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:03,866
(laughing):
I'm a kid again!

39
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:05,353
(laughing)

40
00:02:05,378 --> 00:02:06,891
Oh... gah...

41
00:02:06,913 --> 00:02:08,501
I'll save you!

42
00:02:09,382 --> 00:02:10,565
(grunts)

43
00:02:10,742 --> 00:02:11,995
(grunting)

44
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:14,304
Oh, the only
way out is in!

45
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:18,011
Hey, look at me!
I'm going <i>up</i> a slide!

46
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:20,412
BOTH (chanting): Homer! Homer!

47
00:02:20,452 --> 00:02:22,232
Best recess ever!

48
00:02:22,245 --> 00:02:23,672

49
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,510
- Whoa.
- (gasps)

50
00:02:24,537 --> 00:02:26,177
Help me, guys! Guys?

51
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:27,397
(grunting)

52
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,316
Don't worry, Homer,
I'll call the cops!

53
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:30,896
I'll write my senator.

54
00:02:30,922 --> 00:02:32,937
- Senator!
- Senator!

55
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:38,712
Oh, am I gonna die on a playground,
like some uncoordinated child?

56
00:02:39,364 --> 00:02:41,624
But I did learn something
from all this:

57
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,643
The sprinklers in this
park come on at 3:00 a.m.

58
00:02:47,213 --> 00:02:49,820
Hey, thanks for throwing
the ball back. Really.

59
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:51,132
(sighs)

60
00:02:51,157 --> 00:02:53,391
I'll come back with
the fire truck.

61
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:55,971
I just have to get the
kids to school first.

62
00:02:55,997 --> 00:02:57,484
Oh, are the kids with you?

63
00:02:57,517 --> 00:02:58,637
- LISA: Hi, Dad.
- BART: Homer.

64
00:02:58,656 --> 00:03:01,090
Hey, guys! Why are you
ducked-down like that?

65
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,079
BART: Don't want to be seen with
you when you're hitting bottom.

66
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:04,779
LISA: At least we
hope it's bottom.

67
00:03:04,797 --> 00:03:07,537
Don't worry, it's
bottom, all right.

68
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,427
(grunts)

69
00:03:10,828 --> 00:03:11,849
(Marge groans)

70
00:03:12,564 --> 00:03:14,684
BART: And that's why
I was tardy today.

71
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:16,877
And with that tardiness,
you have at last crossed

72
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,532
the boundary where I can legally
apply physical discipline.

73
00:03:19,545 --> 00:03:21,264
Willie, cut me a switch!

74
00:03:21,293 --> 00:03:23,928
What about the one
your ma used on you?

75
00:03:23,948 --> 00:03:25,781
It, uh, broke
on my buttocks.

76
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:29,915
Serves you right for eating
jam straight out of the jar.

77
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:33,816
Damn it! That's not
even a swivel chair.

78
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,733
Skate, skate as
fast as you can.

79
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:40,621
But I'll catch you...
I'm the Principal Man!

80
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,674
That's the kind of
education you're missing.

81
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,878
(car backfiring)

82
00:03:46,905 --> 00:03:50,494
Oh, no. Uphill. The one
place my car can't go.

83
00:03:50,513 --> 00:03:51,767
(gears grinding)

84
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:53,151
(steam hissing)

85
00:03:55,621 --> 00:03:57,368
Uh, would you
like a quote?

86
00:03:57,387 --> 00:03:58,943
Uh, yes.

87
00:03:58,964 --> 00:04:01,044
"Some cause happiness
wherever they go;

88
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:03,874
Others whenever they go."
Oscar Wilde.

89
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:06,162
Uh, P.S. Your
car is totaled.

90
00:04:08,846 --> 00:04:10,393
Whew! Safe.

91
00:04:10,412 --> 00:04:12,963
JAILBIRD:
Oh, not totally.

92
00:04:12,978 --> 00:04:15,351
Whoa! What-what are
you doing in here?

93
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:17,051
Hiding from the cops.

94
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:19,282
Well, I can't have cops
sniffing around here.

95
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:22,329
- Some of them might be girls.
- Can't I just stay a little?

96
00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:25,405
I only committed this
robbery to help my kid.

97
00:04:25,424 --> 00:04:28,466
See, this is Jeremy.
I need to get him braces.

98
00:04:28,487 --> 00:04:32,380
I always thought that if I'd had
braces, I'd have smiled more.

99
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,573
Hey, I bet you have
a great smile.

100
00:04:34,593 --> 00:04:36,887
- Huh?
- <i>Ay, caramba!</i>

101
00:04:36,915 --> 00:04:40,230
Bart, Bart, we're in
whatchamacallit... a pursuit!

102
00:04:40,252 --> 00:04:43,187
So why'd you come here?
I run a respectable tree house.

103
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,618
Just wondering if
you've seen anything.

104
00:04:44,638 --> 00:04:47,693
Uh, word is you'll, uh...
you'll snitch for candy.

105
00:04:47,712 --> 00:04:50,326
You can't buy me with a
candy bar that has coconut.

106
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,190
Then maybe this is more your...
neighborhood.

107
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:55,579
Nice real estate.
You got a deal.

108
00:04:55,592 --> 00:04:57,165
So, what do you know?

109
00:04:57,183 --> 00:05:01,000
I saw a guy with a gun
and a snake tattoo...

110
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:04,159
say he was gonna hide out
on top of Mount Springfield.

111
00:05:04,172 --> 00:05:06,823
Mount Springfield, eh?

112
00:05:06,852 --> 00:05:09,452
Strap on your
crampons, boys!

113
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:11,234
Eddie! Prepare my litter!

114
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:15,703
Lou, you are responsible for my
oxygen, food, water and cleaning!

115
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,512
- You have to clean me.
- I clean you. Yeah.

116
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:19,849
Dude, thank you.
Why did you save me?

117
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,748
We outlaws have
to stick together.

118
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:23,530
Outlaw? You?

119
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:28,381
Stolen bowling shoes, 3-D glasses, Krusty
standee and this "cage" for my pet.

120
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,361
Oh. What do you feed him?

121
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:31,980
My A.D.D. meds.

122
00:05:32,004 --> 00:05:33,491
(trilling)

123
00:05:33,526 --> 00:05:34,413
(chuckles)

124
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:38,192
Um, listen, would you like two
tickets to the school musical?

125
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:40,956
My son plays the butcher.

126
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,373
In <i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

127
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,193
I'm busy that night.

128
00:05:44,212 --> 00:05:45,949
Yeah, lucky you.

129
00:05:46,265 --> 00:05:48,132
(indistinct chatter)

130
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:49,447
(grunting)

131
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:50,674
Huh?

132
00:05:50,696 --> 00:05:53,463
(gagging)

133
00:05:53,572 --> 00:05:54,365
(gasps)

134
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,997
Are you okay?

135
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:57,681
Don't put more in there!

136
00:05:57,703 --> 00:05:59,203
(choking):
Going for the record.

137
00:05:59,211 --> 00:05:59,891
(choking)

138
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,756
What record?
Stupidest death?

139
00:06:01,781 --> 00:06:03,094
Aah!

140
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:05,649
(grunting)

141
00:06:05,757 --> 00:06:07,124
Blagh!

142
00:06:07,553 --> 00:06:08,900
<i>Merci beaucoup!</i>

143
00:06:08,928 --> 00:06:11,690
- Oh, well, you're very wel...
- That's French for "hello."

144
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,631
- Actually, I think it...
- Lucas Bortner, competitive eater.

145
00:06:14,651 --> 00:06:18,242
A fat kid with a dream?
I can't compete with that.

146
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:21,032
What does a competitive
eater eat?

147
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,474
All the glamour foods: Pizza,
boiled eggs, chicken wings

148
00:06:24,494 --> 00:06:28,022
and the big enchilada, which
is not enchiladas but hot dogs.

149
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,646
69 hot dogs is the current record.
As the great Kobayashi says,

150
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:33,875
<i>"Detekurutoki itaiyo."</i>

151
00:06:33,888 --> 00:06:35,462
What does that mean?

152
00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:36,961
"That's gonna
hurt coming out."

153
00:06:36,982 --> 00:06:39,866
Is Kobayashi the
number one, um, uh...

154
00:06:39,886 --> 00:06:41,699
The correct term
is "gurgitator."

155
00:06:41,727 --> 00:06:43,594
I won't be using the
correct term then.

156
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:46,324
Virtually everyone uses
his technique: Japanesing.

157
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,077
Shall I demonstrate?

158
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:51,431
Um, why don't I just go sit
alone... Oh, you're doing it.

159
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,658
Ready, set...

160
00:06:53,685 --> 00:06:55,686
Japanese!

161
00:06:56,635 --> 00:06:58,136
(choking)

162
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,268
(grunting, groaning)

163
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,948
That's not going down.
(gagging)

164
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:06,031
- This happens from time to time.
- Maybe this isn't the sport for you.

165
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:09,485
It's not a sport.
It's my life.

166
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:11,054
<i>Aw, he's sweet.</i>

167
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,066
(chuckles)
<i>What am I doing?</i>

168
00:07:13,085 --> 00:07:17,033
<i>He's just Ralph with a dream.
The dream of not ralphing.</i>

169
00:07:17,056 --> 00:07:20,446
<i>But I'm sure I could totally
change and fix him.</i>

170
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:23,296
- Can I join you for lunch?
- Um, sure.

171
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:27,212
- How many whole pizzas would you like?
- Um, can I just have a slice?

172
00:07:27,232 --> 00:07:29,253
Interesting technique.
(chuckles)

173
00:07:31,678 --> 00:07:32,771
BART:
Whoa.

174
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:35,824
You didn't tell me you
had a PlayStadium 4!

175
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:38,541
It's the first
I've seen it.

176
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,930
Something's fishy, Bart.

177
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,919
Where's the gift receipt?

178
00:07:42,948 --> 00:07:45,884
Where's the packet of desiccant
that says "Do not eat"?

179
00:07:45,904 --> 00:07:48,577
And, believe me,
you shouldn't.

180
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:52,054
I have a feeling this
PlayStadium was liberated

181
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:55,923
from its previous owner and
given to me in gratitude.

182
00:07:55,936 --> 00:07:58,983
Liberated? You
mean "stolen"?

183
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:01,373
You can't spell "crime"
without "me."

184
00:08:01,386 --> 00:08:03,953
C-R-I... (gasps)

185
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:05,646
There it is, at the end!

186
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:07,171
(doorbell rings)

187
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,745
Oh, hi. Is-is Lisa home?

188
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:12,565
Yes, she is. And
who are you?

189
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:14,052
Lucas.

190
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:17,051
It's pronounced "Luca-dollar."
That's my competition name.

191
00:08:17,077 --> 00:08:18,624
I'm a competitive eater.

192
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,523
HOMER: Competitive eater?
Did I hear right?

193
00:08:20,548 --> 00:08:24,157
- I could be a competitive eater?
- No! You didn't hear anything!

194
00:08:24,176 --> 00:08:26,063
Yes, I did! I heard
"competitive eater"!

195
00:08:26,082 --> 00:08:29,217
It's for people who haven't
had heart problems.

196
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,680
Then that makes me the Jackie
Robinson of the sport,

197
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,720
and you are the racist
Philadelphia manager.

198
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,723
Quit comparing me
to Ben Chapman.

199
00:08:37,743 --> 00:08:40,233
I will when you open
your mind to change!

200
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,700
Oh...!

201
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:45,573
So, what should we practice:
Um, Vienna sausage;

202
00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:48,058
Blueberry pie, short form;

203
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:50,119
Oatmeal, long course;

204
00:08:50,142 --> 00:08:52,954
Freestyle baked beans;
Catfish... ooh!

205
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:55,194
- Cow brains.
- Beans, beans!

206
00:08:55,213 --> 00:08:56,466
We'll do beans.

207
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:01,573
Hmm. Never saw the pork
eat the beans before.

208
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:03,745
(both laugh)

209
00:09:03,764 --> 00:09:08,618
Actually, I'm a little
surprised Lisa likes him.

210
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:12,968
Really! Justin Blobber over there
doesn't remind you of anyone?

211
00:09:12,981 --> 00:09:16,204
$800 to cut me out
of that slide?!

212
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,896
It's all about the money
with those firemen.

213
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,616
Women marry their
fathers, Marge.

214
00:09:21,635 --> 00:09:25,094
So you just might be meeting
your future "ton-in-law."

215
00:09:25,112 --> 00:09:26,539
(both laughing)

216
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:28,460
Ton-in-law.

217
00:09:28,476 --> 00:09:30,443
God bless us.

218
00:09:30,878 --> 00:09:31,658
(gasps)

219
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:33,683
You can do better.

- How 'bout ice cream?
- Yes!

I will lay some

Okay, honey, I made you pork

- Twenty.
- Thanks, babe.

Sorry you had to drop out of
college to feed me full-time.

Oh, yawn.

Another freebie.
Better be a 64 gig.

Bully Avoider, Nosebook,
Insta-Grandma.

255
00:11:42,131 --> 00:11:44,534
This was stolen from Milhouse!

00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:51,494
Maybe it's time to tell me
exactly what's going on.

00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,711
Relax. Listen to the music

No! I won't let this go!

263
00:12:03,704 --> 00:12:07,006
It's time you told me how you've
been getting all this stuff.

(sighs)

265
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,982
I helped Snake out of a jam so
he paid me back in stolen stuff.

266
00:12:11,995 --> 00:12:15,615
It was an honorable arrangement. But
I never thought he'd steal from you.

267
00:12:15,628 --> 00:12:22,314
Snake, eh? I never would've
suspected the one criminal in town.

268
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:24,884
(chuckles)

269
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,539
You seem stressed. You want
to suck some Squishee?

Sure.
(whooshing)

271

- Mmm!
- Careful. It's uncut syrup.

272

BROCKMAN:
<i>Jailbird, A Snake.</i>

275
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:46,762
That's his real name. Albert
Knickerbocker Aloysius Snake...

276
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:48,676
has been arrested for a series
of thefts and may be

277
00:12:48,698 --> 00:12:51,265
put to death under a
controversial new statute.

278
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:52,340
(gasps)

279
00:12:52,368 --> 00:12:55,719
Yeah, we had a law stating
"Three strikes and you're out."

280
00:12:55,738 --> 00:12:59,318
But I thought it was "You're
out." So I let people go.

281
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:02,838
So now it's "Four
balls and you walk.

282
00:13:02,858 --> 00:13:07,309
Right to the electric chair."
It's, uh, much clearer, Kent.

283
00:13:07,342 --> 00:13:09,165
Bart, I'm so sorry.

284
00:13:09,178 --> 00:13:12,365
I just wanted to ruin
his life, not end it.

285
00:13:12,377 --> 00:13:14,244
You ratted him out?
(groans)

286
00:13:14,257 --> 00:13:16,764
- He's got a kid.
- A kid?!

287
00:13:16,783 --> 00:13:19,091
I was crushed when
I lost my dad

288
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:21,925
and all he did was move
to the Holiday Inn.

289
00:13:21,945 --> 00:13:25,757
I can still see him
smoking on the balcony.

290
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:27,941
<i>He looked like he
missed something.</i>

291
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,998
Maybe me.

292
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:32,552
So you see, we can't
let Jailbird fry.

293
00:13:32,565 --> 00:13:35,331
Time for the
Sleepover Detectives.

294
00:13:35,344 --> 00:13:36,891
I didn't say there'd
be a sleepover.

295
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,177
Too bad, 'cause I'm wearing
my pajamas under my clothes.

296
00:13:40,183 --> 00:13:44,824
And my swimsuit under those.
One day it'll all pay off.

297
00:13:44,847 --> 00:13:46,900
(Homer humming jauntily)

298
00:13:46,928 --> 00:13:49,928
Oh! There's my magazine.

299
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:54,217
Why, look at this. "What every
father should do for his daughter."

300
00:13:54,244 --> 00:13:57,605
Oh, Marge, if you want me to
do something, just tell me.

301
00:13:57,617 --> 00:13:59,385
Don't hide behind a magazine.

302
00:13:59,398 --> 00:14:02,084
Right. Right, right, right.
According to Judy Kleinsmith,

303
00:14:02,097 --> 00:14:04,224
a professional
freelance writer,

304
00:14:04,237 --> 00:14:06,580
fathers should take their
daughters out on little

305
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:10,033
dinner dates and treat them
like a gentleman would.

306
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:13,863
Then she'll expect the same
from the men in her future.

307
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:18,469
Wait, let me get this straight: Sit
<i>and</i> eat? That's my punishment?

308
00:14:18,488 --> 00:14:22,188
It's not a punishment. But
you can't just eat dinner.

309
00:14:22,215 --> 00:14:25,727
You have to be gentlemanly
and attentive.

310
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:27,560
Oh, I can fake attentive.

311
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:30,175
I've been watching a football
game this whole discussion.

312
00:14:30,188 --> 00:14:33,593
Not fake attentive.
Real attentive.

313
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:37,756
Okay, okay. I'll make it fun.
I'll take her to that crab place.

314
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:42,128
- All the crabs you could smash.
- You know Lisa's a vegetarian.

315
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,668
She can smash a salad.

316
00:14:43,688 --> 00:14:47,375
No. Homer, you can't just do
the things you want to do.

317
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:51,260
You have to act like someone
you'd want Lisa to marry.

318
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,522
If you just act like yourself,
she might just... um...

319
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:58,224
Oh, you know... um...

320
00:14:58,241 --> 00:15:00,728
She might marry
someone like me?

321
00:15:00,748 --> 00:15:03,148
You think that
would be bad.

322
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:04,801
Homie, I love you.

323
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:08,806
But you can be a challenge,
like doing the Daily Jumble.

324
00:15:08,831 --> 00:15:14,542
Marge, you are comparing me to the most
infuriating thing in the newspaper!

325
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:16,022
Well, I was
just trying to...

326
00:15:16,034 --> 00:15:19,382
Oh... I'm sleeping on
Flanders' couch tonight.

327
00:15:19,408 --> 00:15:21,215
Ours is crap.

328
00:15:21,383 --> 00:15:22,477
(door shuts)

329
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:29,095
So Marge says I gotta
ask Lisa on a date.

330
00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:31,409
Sure you remember how
to ask out a girl, Homer?

331
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:34,039
Yeah, you've been out of
the game a long time there.

332
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,387
Guys, lay off Homer.

333
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:38,922
Now you quit stalling and call
your daughter like a man.

334
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:40,558
Oh... it feels weird.

335
00:15:40,571 --> 00:15:44,727
Just ask your daughter to have dinner
with you. What is the big deal?

336
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,780
Ah, he's doing it!
He's calling a girl.

337
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:48,293
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God... (line ringing)

338
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:49,366
Oh, it's ringing.

339
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:51,219
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

340
00:15:51,238 --> 00:15:52,104
LISA:
<i>Hello?</i>

341
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,441
Uh, hello. Lisa? I know
your brother and...

342
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,642
Oh! Stupid,
stupid, stupid!

343
00:15:57,664 --> 00:15:59,984
Calm down, calm down.
She doesn't know it's you.

344
00:15:59,997 --> 00:16:00,897
(phone ringing)

345
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:02,695
Ah! Hide! Hide!

346
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:03,925
(Moe sighs)

347
00:16:04,535 --> 00:16:08,451
Uh, hello? Oh, sure, Lisa,
uh, your dad's right here.

348
00:16:10,364 --> 00:16:12,351
Dad?
Did you just call?

349
00:16:12,378 --> 00:16:16,946
Uh, yeah. Hey, listen, your mom
thinks that maybe you and I

350
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:19,861
should have dinner
together sometime.

351
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:21,187
Just the two of us?

352
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:23,258
Ah, yeah, I knew
you'd think it's dumb.

353
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:25,552
I'd love that.
See you tonight.

354
00:16:25,571 --> 00:16:26,299
(whoops)

355
00:16:26,312 --> 00:16:29,553
- I got a date with my daughter!
- Yeah, we all been there.

356
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,818
No need to act like you just
invented air conditioning.

357
00:16:36,556 --> 00:16:40,353
So, you see, Chief, Snake wasn't
stealing that stuff out of greed.

358
00:16:40,387 --> 00:16:42,907
He was stealing
it to thank me.

359
00:16:42,926 --> 00:16:46,651
Plea denied. Warm up the
electric chair, Lou.

360
00:16:47,335 --> 00:16:48,682
You're not done yet?

361
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:50,662
The instructions are
in Swedish, Chief.

362
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:52,477
We got this from IKILLYA.

363
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:55,397
- Yo, I totally speak Swedish.
- Fluently?

364
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:56,908
Um, <i>ja.</i>

365
00:16:56,914 --> 00:16:58,343
Uh, do what he says, Lou.

366
00:16:58,372 --> 00:17:00,045
- But Chief...
- But-but-but.

367
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:03,256
Quit arguing and give
him the little wrench.

368
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:05,616
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Let him
out, Lou. Let him out.

369
00:17:05,645 --> 00:17:08,113
But Chief, we got guns;
He's got a little wrench.

370
00:17:08,134 --> 00:17:09,494
It's cold!

371
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:10,849
Y... oh...
(sighs, groans)

372
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,225
All right.

373
00:17:13,553 --> 00:17:15,460
(Wiggum whimpers, groans)

374
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:17,426
Thanks for coming
down, Bart.

375
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:20,173
You won't need to
save me a third time.

376
00:17:20,193 --> 00:17:24,068
- You're going straight?
- If I get caught, it's suicide by cop.

377
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,943
Oh, I don't like
the sound of that.

378
00:17:25,956 --> 00:17:28,019
It means I get you
to shoot me, dude.

379
00:17:28,032 --> 00:17:30,394
Yeah, still sounds like
a lot of paperwork.

380
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,938
Hair volumizer?!

381
00:17:34,962 --> 00:17:36,369
Cologne?!

382
00:17:36,402 --> 00:17:38,594
Hello, Marjorie.

383
00:17:38,614 --> 00:17:41,681
Homie. You look
like an NBA coach.

384
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:46,656
Yes, well, it's a special evening and I
thought it best not to look like a monkey.

385
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:48,206
Mm!

386
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:51,185
Don't worry. I won't
embarrass you.

387
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:55,400
I will put my napkin in my lap, I will
use the utensils provided for me,

388
00:17:55,428 --> 00:17:59,565
and if I our food is slow in coming,
I will "blow my stack" in a manner

389
00:17:59,587 --> 00:18:02,541
befitting the Earl
of Yarborough.

390
00:18:02,554 --> 00:18:04,716
All right, you've
made your point.

391
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:09,548
Hey, I can't screw this up or Lisa
will get stuck with someone like me.

392
00:18:09,574 --> 00:18:12,923
Homie, I don't have
a problem with you.

393
00:18:12,943 --> 00:18:16,054
Except your buttons
are off one.

394
00:18:16,073 --> 00:18:19,518
Actually, this is a collar
button, see? It goes like this...

395
00:18:19,553 --> 00:18:22,572
Tuh! Is there no end
to your fault-finding?

396
00:18:23,576 --> 00:18:25,196
Maggie, help me
with this shirt.

397
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:26,592
(groans)

398
00:18:27,613 --> 00:18:28,863
<i>(Homer and Lisa laughing)</i>

399
00:18:28,955 --> 00:18:32,951
So Mr. Burns never realized it
was Maggie who saved the plant?

400
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:35,118
Nope. Now, how's
that drink?

401
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:36,813
Can I Temple up
that Shirley?

402
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:38,509
Oh, I'm fine.

403
00:18:38,523 --> 00:18:39,774
(giggles)

404
00:18:39,794 --> 00:18:41,259
Well, have we decided?

405
00:18:41,285 --> 00:18:42,732
Uh, yeah, help me out here.

406
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:45,631
What is the normal amount
of entrees per person?

407
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,457
Eh, one, sir.

408
00:18:47,471 --> 00:18:49,886
- I mean for adults.
- One.

409
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,569
No, I mean for
adult males.

410
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:54,897
Yes. I repeat, eh, one.

411
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:57,179
All right, I'll
have the lasagna.

412
00:18:57,206 --> 00:18:59,540
All right. Meat
or vegetarian?

413
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,337
Oh, uh... Oh...

414
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,641
Vegetarian.

415
00:19:02,668 --> 00:19:05,968
(quietly): Can the red
sauce be cow blood?

416
00:19:05,981 --> 00:19:08,163
We'll see what we can do.

417
00:19:08,176 --> 00:19:10,103
Is that Mom?

418
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:12,474
Homer, can you come
with me for a minute?

419
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,815
Marge, please, control your jealousy.
This is your daughter.

420
00:19:15,828 --> 00:19:19,435
We need to have a conversation
in loud whispers.

421
00:19:19,448 --> 00:19:21,308
Uh, excuse me, Lisa.

422
00:19:21,325 --> 00:19:23,476
A friend from high school.

423
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:29,039
Homie, I felt terrible when you
said I felt stuck with you.

424
00:19:29,073 --> 00:19:32,606
But then I realized:
I <i>am</i> stuck with you.

425
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:36,304
I couldn't stop loving
you if I tried.

426
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:38,539
I'm sorry, that's
all very nice.

427
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,397
But I can't forget
what you said.

428
00:19:40,418 --> 00:19:43,103
I know, Homie. I know
you well enough to know

429
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:45,335
you're not ready
to forgive me yet.

430
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:50,716
But I also know you well enough
to know that this will work.

431
00:19:50,741 --> 00:19:52,662
Where'd you get
that dress?

432
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:57,093
Remember that sewing machine
you say I never use?

433
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,293
Well, I sold it and
bought this dress.

434
00:20:00,313 --> 00:20:02,850
Wow... Wow, that
looks just like

435
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,454
the dress you wore
on <i>Project Runway.</i>

436
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:07,480
- Shush-shush-shush.
- Oh, right.

437
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:11,103
I mean, this looks like a dress
from a local Springfield store.

438
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:14,374
All is forgiven.
Let's have dinner.

439
00:20:17,534 --> 00:20:18,228
(clears throat)

440
00:20:18,248 --> 00:20:21,315
Dad, I believe <i>we
</i> were on a date?

441
00:20:21,328 --> 00:20:23,779
Oh, of course.
You're right, honey.

442
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:26,637
I'll just, um... I'll
park it at the bar.

443
00:20:28,245 --> 00:20:30,692
Well, hello.

444
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:34,024
And your lasagna
with cow blood, sir.

445
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:36,640
- Thanks, Frenchy.
- I'm not French,

446
00:20:36,665 --> 00:20:38,150
I'm just pissy.

447
00:20:41,828 --> 00:20:44,709
Lucas. You're not
competitive eating anymore?

448
00:20:44,722 --> 00:20:47,681
No. I realized that
was unrealistic.

449
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,011
Well, that's a relief.

450
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:51,807
My new goal is to become
whatever Adele is.

451
00:20:51,831 --> 00:20:54,351
Just call me Pound-Uca-Dollar.
(chuckles)

452
00:20:54,374 --> 00:20:56,554
What if I just taught
you how to whistle?

453
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,113
You know how to whistle?
Like with your mouth?

454
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,166
(whistles)

455
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:01,923
(blows air)

456
00:21:01,936 --> 00:21:03,461
Hey, I'm doing it!
