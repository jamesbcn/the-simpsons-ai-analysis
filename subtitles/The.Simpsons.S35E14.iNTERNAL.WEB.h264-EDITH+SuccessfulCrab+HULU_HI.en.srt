1
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,507
I don't care what Bart says,

2
00:00:08,584 --> 00:00:12,124
there's nothing crazy about
taking your cat for a walk.

3
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:14,361
[speaking gibberish]

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,739
Huh?

5
00:00:23,914 --> 00:00:25,216
[dog panting]

6
00:00:25,918 --> 00:00:26,988
[goat bleating]

7
00:00:27,054 --> 00:00:28,289
[gasps]

8
00:00:29,091 --> 00:00:31,663
- [dog barking]
- [bird squawking]

9
00:00:31,763 --> 00:00:34,134
Wow. What is this place?

10
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:38,110
This park is a paradise
for emotional support animals

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,615
and their caring human partners.

12
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:42,819
Oh, that's lovely.

13
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:44,188
Now get out!

14
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:47,829
Your mangy cat can't be
in here if she's un-vested.

15
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:51,202
Oh, but my kitty
is so empathetic.

16
00:00:51,303 --> 00:00:54,876
She's the most caring,
lovable, gentle,

17
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,212
- sweet...
- [chicken squawks]

18
00:00:56,312 --> 00:00:58,584
[gasps] My anxiety chicken!

19
00:00:58,718 --> 00:01:00,287
- [Snowball II yowls]
- [chicken squawks]

20
00:01:00,387 --> 00:01:02,759
Somebody do something!

21
00:01:02,893 --> 00:01:05,164
I can't do things,
I'm an empath.

22
00:01:05,264 --> 00:01:06,900
I'm conflict-averse.

23
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,604
Support me, Apples.

24
00:01:08,738 --> 00:01:10,307
Oh, boy.

25
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:13,981
Well, it was peck-and-go
for a minute there,

26
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:16,252
but Gwyneth Poultry
is gonna be all right.

27
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,190
Here's your astronomical bill.

28
00:01:18,323 --> 00:01:20,161
Oh, they'll be covering it.

29
00:01:20,227 --> 00:01:23,166
$16,000?! For a chicken?

30
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,472
I just ate a whole bucket
of them for 20 bucks.

31
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,713
Prosthetic beak?
Cluck-lear implant?

32
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,687
Bawk therapy? We don't
have the money for this.

33
00:01:35,658 --> 00:01:37,161
[squawks weakly]

34
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:38,965
[squawks sadly]

35
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:40,467
Hmm...

36
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:43,240
They say all it takes
to financially ruin a family

37
00:01:43,307 --> 00:01:45,912
is one unexpected medical bill.

38
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:47,448
Who knew ours would be
for jacking up

39
00:01:47,582 --> 00:01:49,619
some bougie-ass chicken?
[laughs]

40
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:53,761
I am so sorry. You can sell
my Malibu Stacy Dream House.

41
00:01:53,828 --> 00:01:57,301
It's increased in value.
I just redid the kitchen.

42
00:01:57,401 --> 00:01:59,940
Relax. We're not gonna
sell your toys.

43
00:02:00,007 --> 00:02:01,811
The sax is where
the real money is.

44
00:02:01,877 --> 00:02:02,913
Homer.

45
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,716
What? My upper-lower,
middle-lower,

46
00:02:04,783 --> 00:02:07,487
lower-class income
isn't gonna get us out of this.

47
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:10,260
Hmm. In order to save
this family,

48
00:02:10,327 --> 00:02:13,066
I'm gonna have to do something
I've never done before,

49
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,669
get a job.

50
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:16,439
Oh, you've had tons of jobs:

51
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:19,713
cop, realtor, gym owner,
erotic baker,

52
00:02:19,813 --> 00:02:21,249
weed sommelier.

53
00:02:21,316 --> 00:02:22,986
Those were for my own growth.

54
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:25,792
This time, it's not personal.

55
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:27,996
Ooh, this one sounds perfect.

56
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:29,265
They're hiring cooks.

57
00:02:29,365 --> 00:02:32,004
Ooh, cooking.
That's one of the only things

58
00:02:32,104 --> 00:02:33,674
I don't doubt myself at.

59
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:36,479
"Exciting work,
competitive salary,

60
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:39,118
team players wanted
at GimmeChow."

61
00:02:39,185 --> 00:02:40,487
What's GimmeChow?

62
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:42,191
It's a new food delivery app.

63
00:02:42,257 --> 00:02:43,794
The teachers have been using it
ever since

64
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:47,134
Lunch Lady Dora was on
Cafeteria Nightmares.

65
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:50,909
[groans] They're only hiring
for evening shifts.

66
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:54,414
Evenings? That's when you
and the food make dinner happen.

67
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:56,286
I don't know how
to make pork chops.

68
00:02:56,352 --> 00:02:58,891
Where do you kill the pigs?
In the sink?

69
00:02:59,024 --> 00:03:01,496
Come on, guys.
We can help Mom out

70
00:03:01,563 --> 00:03:03,299
and cook dinner as a family.

71
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,837
Aw, geez, you know,
I probably would not...

72
00:03:04,937 --> 00:03:06,172
Yeah, I'd love to, but that's...

73
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,877
Homie, we need this.

74
00:03:10,413 --> 00:03:14,889
Honey, of course
we're all happy to help.

75
00:03:14,956 --> 00:03:17,228
Look, I'm already cooking.

76
00:03:17,294 --> 00:03:19,999
This is how nachos are born.

77
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,781
Mr. Largo? But you
already have a job.

78
00:03:26,847 --> 00:03:29,451
I teach music
in a public school, Marge.

79
00:03:29,552 --> 00:03:32,324
Do the math. I sure didn't.

80
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:34,796
Folks, I'm Finn Bon Idée.

81
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:38,871
I am CEO and head mind-blower
here at GimmeChow,

82
00:03:38,938 --> 00:03:42,378
and I came up with a way
to disrupt restaurant delivery.

83
00:03:42,445 --> 00:03:44,448
By getting rid
of the restaurants.

84
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,787
- [explosion]
- Introducing

85
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:48,558
the GimmeChow ghost kitchen.

86
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:50,895
20 new delivery-only
dining concepts,

87
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:54,334
operating out of
one central kitchen, ours.

88
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,207
Together, me and you,
and your shift manager...

89
00:03:57,308 --> 00:03:58,744
[automated voice]
Jill Junderson.

90
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:01,316
...are gonna revolutionize
food delivery

91
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:04,188
and feed all
our friends here in...

92
00:04:04,255 --> 00:04:05,691
[automated voice]
"Spring-feld."

93
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:09,767
That's the excitement
I like to...

94
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,001
Oh, we got a question.

95
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:14,609
Wait, so one kitchen is
pretending to be 20 restaurants

96
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:17,247
when it's actually
zero restaurants?

97
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:19,686
It sounds like
you're catfishing the public.

98
00:04:19,753 --> 00:04:22,358
Think of it as
catfish po'boy-ing them,

99
00:04:22,424 --> 00:04:25,632
which is a special
at Mama Juju's Bayou Bistro.

100
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,636
How much does this job pay?

101
00:04:27,703 --> 00:04:30,240
- Minimum wage.
- [overlapping grumbling]

102
00:04:30,307 --> 00:04:33,614
Plus overtime.
Sweet, juicy overtime.

103
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:36,152
That'll replace
the newspaper in your wallet.

104
00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:38,155
And believe me,
this job's gonna be

105
00:04:38,222 --> 00:04:40,561
"easy peasy
like grilled cheesy."

106
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:45,470
One Easy Peasy Grilled Cheesy.
That's you, Chef.

107
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:49,245
Chef? [chuckles] Wow.
No one's ever called me...

108
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:50,848
Make that 11 grilled cheeses.

109
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,988
Six sushi burritos.
21 loaded churros.

110
00:04:54,088 --> 00:04:56,025
They're not stopping!

111
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,095
Cheeses. I need cheeses.

112
00:04:58,162 --> 00:05:01,670
Cheesus, Allah, Buddha, Hashem.
We need 'em all, Chef.

113
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:05,645
Hot stuff coming through, Chef.

114
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:08,851
For the last time,
you're not my type, Chef.

115
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:11,255
- Corner.
- Behind.

116
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:13,894
- Under.
- Whoo. Over.

117
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:16,365
- Betwixt.
- Ceiling.

118
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:18,837
Baloney banh mi.
Veal lover's pizza.

119
00:05:18,938 --> 00:05:20,908
And fire those
grilled cheeses, Chef.

120
00:05:20,941 --> 00:05:24,281
Heard, Chef. Give me a sec.
I need mayo.

121
00:05:24,348 --> 00:05:26,720
- Ah!
- Please don't press charges.

122
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:29,292
My parole officer's
trying to three-strike me

123
00:05:29,392 --> 00:05:31,195
instead of breaking up
with me like a man.

124
00:05:31,295 --> 00:05:33,901
It's fine. It's fine.
It's not deep.

125
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:37,040
Oh. Where the hell's the mayo?

126
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,811
Here's your mayo, Chef.

127
00:05:38,878 --> 00:05:42,919
Ah. This is Wing Hut on Super
Bowl Sunday all over again.

128
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:47,327
Where the hell are my damn
grilled cheeses, Chef?

129
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:51,168
Ah. Spill. Sorry, Chef.
I'll get it.

130
00:05:51,235 --> 00:05:53,740
[grunting]

131
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:57,481
[bleep]

132
00:05:57,582 --> 00:05:59,484
Here's your pho, Chef.

133
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:08,235
Get your dumplings
off my burner.

134
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,006
[gasps]

135
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:13,881
Homer, it's afternoon.
Why didn't you wake me up?

136
00:06:13,948 --> 00:06:16,787
I tried, but you hit me
with a spatula.

137
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:21,061
Oh, this is my only day
with all of you and I missed it.

138
00:06:21,128 --> 00:06:23,199
How are things
at GimmeChow, Mom?

139
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:24,802
It's been two months of hell.

140
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:27,273
Last night, Kirk lost
the tip of his finger

141
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,445
in someone's disco fries.

142
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:32,818
Disco guys like disco fr...

143
00:06:35,523 --> 00:06:36,592
Oh, God!

144
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:38,998
So, how's dinner
been going without me?

145
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:41,970
Great. Tonight,
we're all making lasagna.

146
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:44,408
You know, cooking as a family
has been kind of fun.

147
00:06:44,474 --> 00:06:45,443
Right, kids?

148
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:46,980
Mm-hmm.

149
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:50,854
Oh... Knowing you all are making
home-cooked meals together

150
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:53,861
is the only thing
getting me through this.

151
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:56,231
Love you so much. Bye.

152
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,839
She's gone. It's GimmeChow time.

153
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:01,977
I'm getting pizza,
pierogis, and paella.

154
00:07:02,077 --> 00:07:03,980
Fish-and-chips
and cake pops for me.

155
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:06,987
Guys, we've been ordering
delivery for two months.

156
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,691
I'm getting an ulcer
from all the lying.

157
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,495
Or all the chile rellenos.

158
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:13,132
We got to tell Mom.

159
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,570
Hey, hey, hey.
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.

160
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,708
Let's not do anything rash.

161
00:07:17,808 --> 00:07:21,115
We'll totally cook
for ourselves, tomorrow.

162
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:23,653
But we still need to eat
tonight, right?

163
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:25,357
Indian food, maybe?

164
00:07:25,423 --> 00:07:28,162
Well, I am a little hungry.

165
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:30,868
Tofu tikka masala.

166
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:34,442
Mmm. Tofu tikka masala.

167
00:07:34,508 --> 00:07:36,980
Tofu tikka masala. Order up.

168
00:07:37,046 --> 00:07:40,119
Hey, hey, good news, gang.
Don't stop working.

169
00:07:40,186 --> 00:07:42,191
You guys have been
such rock stars,

170
00:07:42,324 --> 00:07:45,063
management is gifting you all
smartwatches.

171
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,332
Apple Watches?

172
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,737
Ankle watches. Monitors, really.

173
00:07:48,837 --> 00:07:50,640
They buzz and say stuff
to make sure

174
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:54,281
you're always hustling

to go on strike.

without our leader.

I didn't realize it,

I'm gonna be as impartial
as possible here.

Why are you starving America
with your psychotic demands?

382
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:27,040
We're not starving anyone.

383
00:16:27,107 --> 00:16:29,143
All we want is our fair share.

Yes. And here to tell us why

- Homer Simpson.
- What?

388
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:38,562
Hey, Cliff.
Big fan of your whole deal.

389
00:16:38,628 --> 00:16:40,868
Homer, you're working for them?

390
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:42,370
I sure am.

391
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,541
I was honored when GimmeChow
offered to pay me

00:16:44,607 --> 00:16:46,913
in GimmeChow gift cards
to talk to America

393

about... "how unions
get in the way of innovation."

394
00:16:50,921 --> 00:16:53,793
You're in a union

And I haven't innovated
one thing over there.

Look, we're living

This little device
can get me anything I want.

Songs, sneakers, anonymous
gay hook-ups, so I hear.

Why shouldn't it
also bring me food?

But at the cost of human misery?
