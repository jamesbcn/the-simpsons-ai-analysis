{\an8}BART: Ice cream at church?

{\an8}I'm intrigued, yet suspicious.

14
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,917
{\an8}Wow, look at all these flavors.

15
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,007
{\an8}"Blessed Virgin Berry,
Command-Mint, Bible-Gum."

16
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,314
{\an8}Or if you prefer, we also have
Unitarian ice cream.

17
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,351
{\an8}-There's nothing here.
-Exactly.

18
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,193
{\an8}One Tower of Babel and build it to heaven.

19
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,771
{\an8}To heaven!

20
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,856
{\an8}Oh.

00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,540
{\an8}(clears throat) Hi.

26
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,328
{\an8}I've created the first
intra-bovine ice-cream maker.

27
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,463
{\an8}It makes use of all four stomachs.

28
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:08,341
{\an8}The first being filled with
rock salt, then sugar, cream...

29
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:12,089
{\an8}and of course, Freon so cold it burns me.

30
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,553
{\an8}I'll have the darkety kind.

31
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,014
{\an8}Uh, one chocolate, Mootilda.

32
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,095

33
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,602
(gulps)

34
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,603
{\an8}Can I have a swirl
of chocolate and vanilla?

35
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,806
{\an8}-Huh? Uh-uh!
-Oh, nonsense. You can do it.

36
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,978
{\an8}-(moos)
-(yelps) Ivan Reitman!

37
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,777

-Ow!

38
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:37,281
{\an8}-I've never seen a brain freeze this bad.
-(whining)

39
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,615
{\an8}Give me 50cc's of hot fudge, stat.

40
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,908
{\an8}Hold still. You're gonna feel
a slight chocolaty sensation.

00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,167

00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,039

{\an8}All right, let's welcome
this evening's entertainment.

45
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,844
{\an8}They call her the Christian Madonna...

50
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,148
{\an8}-(singing continues)
-Rachel Jordan?

51
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,189
{\an8}Isn't that the woman
you had a crush on, Ned?

52
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:14,193
{\an8}(stammering)
I didn't have a "crush" on her.

53
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,317
-Are you blushing, Mr. Flanders?
-No, I'm not-

54
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,945
-Leave Ned alone.
-Thank you, Homer.

55
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,373
He can't admit he likes her till he's sure
she likes him back.

56
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,253
And there's only one way to find out.

57
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,622
{\an8}Does... Rachel... like... Ned?

58
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,955
It says I have cooties.

59
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,764
Flanders has cooties!
Flanders has cooties!

60
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,378
(applause)

61
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,550
{\an8}That was great. I can't believe
she found a rhyme for Hezekiah.

62
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,638
Hey, she's coming this way!

63
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,063
(gasps, clears throat)

64
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,771
I thought you didn't like her.

65
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,191
(all laugh)

66
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,154
-Oh!
-(gasps) Ned Flanders?

67
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,243
Now, where have you been
hi-diddly-hiding?

68
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,858
Uh-uh-uh... Oh, hey, Rachel. (chuckles)
Well, what do you know?

69
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,277
We both like plain vanilla
with nothin' on it.

70
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,406
Actually, all the toppings were gone.

71
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,583
(both groan)

72
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:09,422
Ants are crawling in my mouth,
and I don't care.

73
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,459
So, uh, where's your band?

74
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,342
They switched from
Christian music to regular pop.

75
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,590
All you do is change "Jesus" to "baby."

76
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,513
-Oh, how horrible.
-Uh! They'll all go to hell.

77
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,052
Say, how's your life going?

78
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,596
{\an8}Ooh, she wants to know
how your life is going.

79
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:29,061
{\an8}Well, my wife's passing was rough.
But I think I'm finally ready to move on.

80
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:32,113
That's great.
Maybe we could have coffee sometime.

81
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:35,778
Oh, she wants to have coffee sometime!

82
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:39,398
-I can hear her, Homer!
-He can hear you, Rachel!

83
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,947
(clears throat) I'd love to get together,

84
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,830
but tomorrow I've got lifeguard duty
at the baptismal pool.

85
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,908
OK. Well, maybe another time.

86
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,044
You know, I'd better
go check into my hotel.

87
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,791
Hotel? Why don't you just
stay at Ned's place?

88
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,543
My place? What would the neighbors think?

89
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,455
We're the neighbors, and we don't think.

90
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,884
Ned, I understand
if you feel uncomfortable.

91
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,423
You're still getting over your wife.

92
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,376
Now, wait just a Maude-gone minute, here!

93
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,636
I'm through livin' in the past,
and you can see for yourself.

94
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,812
Well, you've certainly got a theme going.

95
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,111
All right, I'll take the couch,
and you can have my room.

96
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,646
Oh, uh, could you sleep on my side?

97
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,903
I'm trying to preserve
Maude's indentation.

98
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,702
-Sorry.
-Oh, no problem!

99
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,319
A little starch will fix her right up.

100
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,993
-(shudders)
-Cold, huh?

101
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,413
This should keep you toasty.

102
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,463
{\an8}How about that? It says "Maude."

103
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,210
{\an8}(sniffs) Mmm, I love chenille. Don't you?

104
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,174
{\an8}I don't love it. I don't hate it.

105
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,974
Mmm, well, good night, Maude.
I mean, Maude.

106
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,259
I mean, Rachel! I mean, Maude.

107
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,843
{\an8}Oop!

108
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,773
(Ned humming)

109
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,850
(gasps, shrieks)

110
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:59,067
Oh, my God! You're trying to make me
look like your dead wife!

111
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,450
No, no, now, I-- I know
this is a... tad unseemly

112
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,658
but if you just let me even out the back-

113
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,699
I'm calling a cab! Good-bye, Ned!

114
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,581
{\an8}-(door slams)
-Oh, who am I kidding?

115
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,372
{\an8}I'm not over Maude at all.

116
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,076
HOMER: Yeah, maybe it was too soon.

117
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,956
Well? Aren't you gonna invite me in?

118
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,554
I sure appreciate you folks
offering to go through Maude's things.

119
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,934
If it were up to me,
I wouldn't throw anything away.

120
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,811
Oh, don't you worry.
We'll make all the hard decisions

121
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,179
so you don't have to.

122
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:34,305
{\an8}-We can take whatever we want, right?
-Ye-- What?

123
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,444
{\an8}Don't listen to him. You just have
a good time at the eye doctor.

124
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,733
Always do!

125
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,186
-HOMER: Say, "Bye, Mr. Flanders."
-CHILDREN: Bye, Mr. Flanders!

126
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,366
MARGE: Poor Ned.

127
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,738
He can't look anywhere
without being reminded of Maude.

128
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,907
Yeah, a lifetime of memories. (grunts)

129
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,496
Homer, don't you have any respect?

130
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,382
Sure. Of course I do. But life goes on.

131
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,500
Ashes to ashes. Turn, turn, turn.

132
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,377
Long live rock, and so forth.

133
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,634
(humming)

134
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,636
{\an8}Don't throw this away.
It's Rod's first tooth.

135
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,639
You're right. We could use this
for witchcraft.

136
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,271
Wow. Three pairs of shoes.

137
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,520
Someone had a fetish.

138
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,442
{\an8}-(music box slows, stops)
-(Homer grunting)

139
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,612
Man, this is taking forever.

140
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,731
I know how to speed things up.

141
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,398
(whining, grinding)

142
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,082
-(banging)
-Her pillow's stuck.

143
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,738
(gulps)

144
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:39,333
NED: Oh, my. The room looks so bare.

145
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,957
-Are you OK, Ned?
-Yeah, just a little shocked.

146
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,875
What's that? Some kind of sorting machine?

147
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,674
-Kinda.
-(whining, grinding)

148
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,349
Now for the awkward part.

149
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,099
-We gotta talk about money.
-(gasps)

150
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,931
You said we were doing
this out of friendship.

151
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,726
What? That doesn't sound like me.

152
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,399
{\an8}Hey, Dad. Something didn't get,
um, "sorted."

153
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,356
(gasps) Maude's old sketchbook.

154
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,940
She was quite the little artist, you know.

155
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,435
Oh, eh, is that a fact?
And you think you know someone.

156
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,817
There's our house. A rainbow.

157
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,776
Oh, a white hand shaking a black hand.

158
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:15,789
"Praiseland"?

159
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,422
"Rides, food"? A"tithing pond"?

160
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,039
-LISA: It looks like an amusement park.
-NED: You're right!

161
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,507
Maude designed a Christian amusement park.

162
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,838
-Oh, it must've been her final dream.
-Hey, how about that?

163
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,755
{\an8}Let's build it for her, Daddy.

164
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,853
(chuckles) Oh, that's a nice thought,
Toddy.

165
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:38,349
But to build an amusement park, you need
lots of money and manpower and turnstiles.

166
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,194
But Mommy wanted it.

167
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,781
Hmm?

168
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,735
But where do you put something that big?

169
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,155
You could fix up
the old Storytime Village.

170
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,075
They've been out of business
ever since that kid got his head cut off.

171
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,084
-That sounds perfect.
-Well, what the heck?

172
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:06,667
-Who's ready to build an amusement park?
-ALL: Yay!

173
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,006
Sell Storytime Village?

174
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,472
Why, you gotta be off your tuffet!

175
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,183
Well, it's been closed
for so long, and-- and l--

176
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,684
I thought I could turn it
into a-- a Christian theme park.

177
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:23,307
Christian, eh? Well, that's different.

178
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,106
Now, the thing is
I don't have a lot of money.

179
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,190
And what the hell good are you?
Beat it, you hippie!

180
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,697
-But l--
-You're right. That was harsh.

181
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,699
Tell you what.

182
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,870
Maybe I could donate
the park as a tax write-off.

183
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,710
(gasps) If you could do that, I'd make
this place a shining beacon for the Lord!

184
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,708
Ah, you are so full of it!

185
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,461
God's grace, that is.

186
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,553
It's really sickening...

187
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,208
there aren't more people like you.

188
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,127
Now get out...

189
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,715
{\an8}your pen and we'll make it official.

190
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,801
Oh, bless you, sir!

191
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:03,635
(grunts) Geppetto's workshop will make
a great stable for the Nativity scene.

192
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,858
(grunting)

193
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,768
You're doing that the sucker way.

194
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,607
Try a little vitamin "G"!

195
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,613
(humming)

196
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,618
(gasps) Are you nuts?

197
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:19,238
Relax. It's a controlled burn. Uh-oh.

198
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,037
(lamb bleating)

199
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,422
(grunting)

200
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,424
Huh?

201
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,628
Darn teenagers with their beer bottles.

202
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,262
Uh, yeah. Teenagers. Huh!

203
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,715
(sighs)

204
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,590
Ned, I'm worried about you.

205
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,507
You've been working nonstop
for the past week.

206
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,217
Well, it's been a tad harder
than I thought.

207
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:45,477
But I'm not complaining,
'cause I work for a sweet, sweet boss.

208
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,435
You're our foreman, Maude.

209
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:51,571
She's still bossing you around
from beyond the grave? Can they do that?

210
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,361
No, I don't mind, but my greenback stack's
gettin' kind of slack.

211
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,946
How about asking the community
for donations?

212
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,162
(chuckles) I'm not very good
at begging people for stuff.

213
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,873
I am. I'd be glad to spearhead
the entire begging initiative.

214
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,375
-Oh, thanks, Homer.
-No problem.

215
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,378
I'll need a sack and something sharp.

216
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,665
Well, I guess I could
donate these costumes.

217
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,176
They're from my Last Supper
pie-throwing sketch.

218
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:17,894
(Wiggum grunts)

219
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,758
You can have these,
uh, fireworks I confiscated.

220
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,636
Some Chinese people claimed they were
celebrating New Year's in February.

221
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:28,475
(laughs) Oh, yeah. Those guys
and their crazy scams.

222
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,022
(both laugh)

223
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,226
Good food, though.

224
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,609
This sawdust'll soak up the puke
from the roller coaster.

225
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,738
That's Willie's special blend.

226
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,115
(sniffing)

227
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,331
{\an8}Do I detect a hint of cinnamon?

228
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,333
{\an8}Oh, I'll never tell.

229
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,535
<i>Praiseland amusement park</i>
<i>has its grand opening today.</i>

230
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:54,206
<i>We now go live to its founder,</i>
<i>Mr. Nedward Flanders.</i>

231
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,586
<i>Oh, morning, Kent.</i>
<i>Our volunteers have done an amazing job</i>

232
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,175
<i>-getting the park ready here.</i>
-(chuckles)

233
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,850
<i>We're gonna show Springfield</i>
<i>that faith and devotion</i>

234
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,269
<i>-are the wildest thrill rides of all.</i>
-(babbles, gasps)

235
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,439
<i>All right. I hear the mayor's arriving</i>
<i>for the ribbon cutting.</i>

236
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,270
It is with great pride that I dedicate

237
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,356
this new school,
sports arena or attraction.

238
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,360
{\an8}(crowd cheering)

239
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,922
Well, Maude, your dream
has finally come true.

240
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,961
(children shouting, laughing)

241
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,176
<i>Halt! Who dares to disturb King David?</i>

242
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,224
<i>Silence! You have invaded the chamber</i>

243
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:48,265
<i>where I wrote all of my 150 psalms.</i>

244
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,810
-(all gasp)
<i>-I hope you enjoy hearing them all.</i>

245
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,322
<i>Number one. "Blessed is the man</i>

246
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,989
<i>who does not walk</i>
<i>in the council of the wicked."</i>

247
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,071
{\an8}What do you hit 'em with?

248
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,786
-There's no mallet.
-You can stop Satan with your faith.

249
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,828
My face? You callin' me ugly?

250
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,792
No, no, no, no. I think you're beautiful.

251
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:13,082
-Oh, that's it!
-(shrieks)

252
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,837
Ooh, what can I get you, little Christian?

253
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,460
How about a Noah's Ark of jellies?

254
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,547
Oh, are there two of every flavor?

255
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,973
-Nope. They're all the same-- plain.
-Oh.

256
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,255
How about a Maude mask?

257
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,427
(as Maude) I'm Maude. God is super!

258
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,937
{\an8}Can I sit in the car?

259
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,938
{\an8}-Let's both sit in the car.
-Bye-bye.

260
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:37,781
A Bible park without beer? (scoffs)
Now I've seen everything!

261
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,898
And this candy is sub-par.

262
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,945
Any religion that embraces carob is, uh,
not for Carl Carlson.

263
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,829
Oh! Hey, get out of the way,
pal. You're blocking the exit.

264
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,410
{\an8}Oh, you want me to stamp
your hand so you can get back in?

265
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,496
{\an8}Don't you dare!

266
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,706
-Bye, everybody!
-What a rip-off!

267
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,342
It ain't even worth torching.

268
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,498
Whoa! Where's everyone going?
What's wrong?

269
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,167
This place is the height of tedium.

270
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,127
Yar! She blows!

271
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,047
(gasps)

272
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,759
(sighs)

273
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,768
Oh, Maude, I turned your dream
of a Christian amusement park

274
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,101
into a bemusement park.

275
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,016
-(gasps) Don't say that, Ned!
-It is!

276
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,726
It's a bemusement park!

277
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,869
I'm sorry, sweetheart. Oh, please,
don't look at me like that!

278
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,372
(gasps)

279
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,041
-(all gasp)
-It's a miracle!

280
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:42,629
-(all exclaiming)
-It's almost like she's alive again.

281
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,255
What's that, floating mask?

282
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,391
Y-You want me to shoot everyone?

283
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,388
(all exclaiming)

284
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,259
Nah, I'm just screwin' with ya.
It's a miracle.

285
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,517
ALL: Oh!

286
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,240
-(all exclaiming)
-This is fantastic.

287
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:07,359
I've never been so close
to rubbing my eyes in disbelief.

288
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,528
Oh, what the heck! Huh? Huh?

289
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:14,618
I think it's a sign from God
that we should all go nuts! Whoa-hoa!

290
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,325
-What the-
-(grunting)

291
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,705
Ah! What is wrong with you?

292
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,792
-Go get that!
-Yes, ma'am.

293
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,837
Well, looks like our phenomenon
is actually a phenome-not!

294
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,968
(chuckles) Because when you look
at it rationally--

295
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,386
(gibberish) Hakala makta towhoo abowhoo.

296
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,516
Hakala makta towhoo abowhoo.

297
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,862
-(all exclaiming)
-He's speaking in tongues!

298
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:44,149
Oh, knock it off, Seymour!
Go find that boy with my purse!

299
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:48,994
-Oh! It was incredible! I saw heaven!
--(all gasp)

300
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,413
But it wasn't clouds
and angels playing harps

301
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,122
like at the end of so many
<i>Three Stooges </i>shorts.

302
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,213
It was a golden elementary school

303
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,498
with a teacher's lounge that stretched
as far as the eye could see.

304
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,253
-And no one was ever tardy.
-Was I there?

305
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:06,506
No! It was heaven, my vision of heaven.

306
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,930
(crowd murmuring)

307
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,428
Oh, truly this was the will of Maude.

308
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,812
Hey, I want the Maude statue
to give me a vision!

309
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:14,889
CROWD: Yeah!

310
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,484
WIGGUM: Yeah! I want to hallucinate, too!

311
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,767
{\an8}I'm sorry. The ticket price doesn't cover

312
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:23,153
visions, miracles or other godly hoo-ha.

313
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:27,322
Yeah, folks. The power of Christ
compels you to give Ned an extra 10 bucks.

314
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,613
(chattering, shouting)

315
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,776
Homer, no! I can't exploit
a divine manifestation.

316
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,025
Oh, why not? Everybody's doin' it.

317
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:37,448
You could give the money to the orphanage.
I hear they need a new wall.

318
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,788
(whimpering) Three is not enough.

319
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:44,384
(coughing, gagging)

320
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,301
(chattering)

321
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,677
(humming)

322
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,850
Maude, it's Disco Stu.

323
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,269
Lay some heaven on me, foxy dead chick.

324
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,559
Ooh! (grunting)

325
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,308
(disco music playing)

326
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,359
Ah, Disco Stu. Right this way.

327
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,239
But, hey, Saint Peter, you just said,
like, you was full.

328
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:15,032
-DISCO STU: Oh, yeah!
-Ah, geez.

329
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,157
-(music continues)
-Ah! Ooh! Ah!

330
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:22,165
{\an8}-Whoa, Frank Sinatra!
-For me, this is hell. You dig, pally?

331
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,166
Ah, ah!

332
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,001
{\an8}(grunting)

333
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,180
-Who's next?
-That would be me. Thank you, sonny.

334
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,220
(grunting)

335
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,388
(alarm blaring)

336
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,443
My chair! It's... got a mind of its own!

337
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,818
-Help me, Mr. Spock!
-Shazbot! My captain is in peril.

338
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,954
(shouting)

339
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,503
You saved the captain's life.
I want to make out with you.

340
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,788
And so do Catwoman and Agent 99.

341
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,582
-(purrs)
-(kisses)

342
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:04,665
Oh!

343
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,546
How come everybody's
having visions, Daddy?

344
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,259
Oh, there's no explaining
God's will, Roddy.

345
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,260
That's like explaining
how an airplane flies.

346
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:19,063
Stupid grill! Why won't you light?
The gas is on full blast.

347
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,559
You better stick your head in
and see what's goin' on.

348
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,682
Good idea.

349
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,148
No, Dad! I think
there's a leak in the line!

350
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,480
Leak in the line?

351
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,986
(hissing)

352
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,075
(gibberish)

353
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,700
Oh, no! This isn't a divine miracle.

354
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,078
Everyone's just gettin'
goofy from the gas.

355
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,419
(gibberish)

356
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,298
Uh-Uh, folks, I just discovered,

357
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:56,551
eh, something about this statue that,
uh, may disappoint you.

358
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,635
You see-

359
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,887
What is it, Mr. Flanders?

360
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,475
Is something wrong with the miracle?

361
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:10,191
Will there still be money
for the orphans? (wheezing)

362
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,994
(coughing)

363
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:17,068
Hello, gas company?
How poisonous is your gas?

364
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,656
Wow. Bu-- Eh-- But I'm talking about,

365
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,041
you know, outdoors
with plenty of ventilation.

366
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,449
That-- How could that be worse?

367
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,325
OK, permanent brain damage
or just temporary?

368
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,417
I see.

369
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,464
I gotta close Praiseland down.
Someone could get hurt.

370
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,551
(sighs)

371
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:39,852
"Could" get hurt. "Could."
There's a chance they won't.

372
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,848
Ned, Praiseland has
touched an entire town...

373
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:47,191
with its inspiring message
and toxic super freak-outs!

374
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:51,769
Look at those smiling faces.
Rich laughing with poor.

375
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,687
Bullies breaking bread with nerds.

376
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,066
{\an8}Orphans lighting candles
over a leaking gas line.

377
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,195
Lighting candles?

378
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,201
-(gasping)
-(groaning)

379
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,044
TOGETHER: No-o-o!

380
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,365
(scream, groan)

381
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,628
I can't feel my legs.

382
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,419
I taste blood.

383
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,302
(Ned and Homer sigh)

384
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,919
-(all gasp)
-Adults attacking orphans?

385
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,677
I don't think Maude Flanders
would approve of that.

386
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,140
Absolutely not!

387
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,260
-Never!
-No friggin' way!

388
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,137
Yeah. This place is more like "Crazeland."

389
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,555
-CROWD: Huh?
-Instead of "Praiseland."

390
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,734
-CROWD: Oh!
-I see.

391
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,231
It's a play on words.

392
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:42,913
May the Lord have mercy
on your gas-sniffin', orphan-beatin' soul!

393
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,411
-Christ be with you!
-(horn honking)

394
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,624
Hey, Ned!

395
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,673
I just read about your park
in that horrible <i>AAA </i>magazine.

396
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,170
Ooh, Ned, look who's here.
It's that girl you don't like.

397
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,423
Not! (laughing)

398
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,756
Hey, your hair's grown back real nice.

399
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:03,851
It's a wig. And let's never
speak of it again.

400
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:04,969
So what happened here?

401
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,055
How about I explain it to you
over a cup of coffee?

402
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,481
That is if you're willing
to give me another shot.

403
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,492
Are you sure you want to do this, Ned?

404
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,283
I'm sure.

405
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,879
-So how about a movie tomorrow night?
-Sounds great.

406
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,418
I think Ned is gonna be all right.

407
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,224
