1
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:48,149
Flanders.

2
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:46,140
Maybe we should find
a new playground.

3
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:53,247
Well, this looks nice.

4
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:56,817
Shady trees,

5
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:58,552
bathrooms with doors

6
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,187
and that loopy-loop slide

7
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:03,924
dumps you out
on soft recycled tires.

8
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,926
Oh, Pirellis.

9
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,829
Oh, look!
It's your friend Hudson.

10
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,253
My son seems
to really like your daughter.

11
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:36,423
- Courtney.
- Marge.

12
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,726
Is that ironic or retro?

13
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:39,927
It's my name.

14
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,663
They're having so much fun.

15
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,200
- Is she free for a playdate tomorrow?
- Yes.

16
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:48,369
Has she been in the same room
as a peanut recently?

17
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:49,370
No.

18
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:50,938
Can I check off
her vaccinations?

19
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:53,774
TB? DTaP?
Measles-mumps-rubella?

20
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,476
Yes, yes, yes.

21
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:58,913
Breast or bottle?

22
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,347
Bottle, but I'm not a monster.

23
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:01,815
I can bring cookies.

24
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,686
White sugar.
That's hilarious.

25
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:07,688
I'll have to tell my partner
you said that.

26
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:11,025
Well, I'm gonna tell my partner
you mocked white sugar.

27
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:12,660
See you tomorrow.

28
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,202
Pancakes are on the table,
Homie.

29
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:23,704
And flapjacks will be ready
in a few minutes.

30
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:25,873
Marge, I'm trying
to lose weight.

31
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,775
Pancakes will be fine.

32
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:28,876
Are you sure?

33
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:29,910
I have to face facts.

34
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:31,245
In some small ways,

35
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:33,314
I've let myself go.

36
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,883
What's wrong?
Who died?

37
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,251
We're worried you will.

38
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:39,753
We want you to live longer, Dad.

39
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,055
Never what I want.

40
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,556
Fine.

41
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:44,458
You know what,
skip the pancakes.

42
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:45,893
I'll just have...

43
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,761
a grapefruit to go.

44
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,434
I didn't see the moon landing
or the fall of the Berlin Wall,

45
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,004
but I did see my father
take a grapefruit to go.

46
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:07,715
Thanks a lot, pal!

47
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,216
You cost us the pennant!

48
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:10,784
Yeah, right there!

49
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,822
Ah, yesterday's pizza.

50
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,991
I've been dreaming about you,
my friend.

51
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:20,327
While I slept,
I said, extra large.

52
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:23,597
But I told my wife I said,
Sexy Marge.

53
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:39,113
Oh, why didn't I put on
my pizza-eating gloves?

54
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,458
Where are you, Homer?

55
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,394
Burns just called
a staff meeting.

56
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,929
The only seats are next to him.

57
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,002
Oh, God, I need a miracle.

58
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,972
Hey, why don't you bring
a balloon to your coworkers?

59
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,309
They're like kites
without the hard work.

60
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:12,680
How long have you been selling
balloons?

61
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,682
It's an interesting story.

62
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:17,818
<i>Well, this is a story
of a poor mountain man</i>

63
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,987
<i>Spoke worse English
than Mr. Jackie Chan</i>

64
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:21,889
<i>Then one day,
he was tendin' to his still</i>

65
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:25,726
<i>Heard a hissing sound
and his pants began to fill</i>

66
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:26,860
Helium.

67
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,362
See-through gold.

68
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:31,031
Symbol, H-E.

69
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,666
<i>Well, the first thing
you know...</i>

70
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,202
He's gone.

71
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:38,005
My best friend is gone.

72
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:39,173
I want you to know

73
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:43,010
that the coworker you thought
was Chip Incognito

74
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:45,179
was actually me undercover.

75
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,247
Sorry I'm late, everybody.
Here, have a balloon.

76
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:50,951
Simpson, Mr. Burns
is a Fortune 500 CEO.

77
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:51,952
He's not going to...

78
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,387
Quiet, you fool.

79
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:56,957
Pure, uncut helium.

80
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,426
Thanks to birthday balloons,
rarer than ever.

81
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:01,829
Smithers, might I remind you
we pay a fortune

82
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,832
for helium to cool our reactors?

83
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:05,866
Right as always, sir.

84
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,835
That price is sky-high!

85
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,169
Where did you get this?

86
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,839
Oh, the bumpkin I got it from
has tons of it.

87
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:12,840
But I got to warn you...

88
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,576
he has no idea
of what it's worth.

89
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,244
Excellent.

90
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:19,246
How I love a good swindle.

91
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:20,914
What do you think?

92
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,716
He called on me!

93
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,587
As for you, Simpson,
Employee of the Month.

94
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:29,857
So, Marge,

95
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,259
I killed it
at the staff meeting today.

96
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,061
The key is preparation.

97
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:36,563
Something amazing
has happened to Maggie.

98
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,799
She's in love.

99
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:47,141
If this gets any cuter,
I'm gonna bust.

100
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,890
Cletus, get the dang door!

101
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:06,560
I can't very well answer the
door with an unloaded shotgun,

102
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,695
can I, woman?

103
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,798
Howdy, neighbor.

104
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:14,735
May I offer you
some Manhattan squirrel chowder?

105
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:17,971
You smell like indoor plumbin'.

106
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,173
He's onto us.

107
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,074
No need to pretend
we're inbred hicks.

108
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,476
No offense, goober.

109
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,645
None taken.

110
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:30,184
All right, Spuckler,
you've got helium, which I want.

111
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,485
I've got what you want,

112
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:33,587
a tin cup filled with dimes.

113
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:36,190
Let's make a deal.

114
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,658
Now, hold on.

115
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,093
I likes to have a drink
with a feller

116
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,863
beforen I make
a busy-ness deal.

117
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,432
I have imbibed every intoxicant

118
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:48,101
from sweet Yale beer
to Flint, Michigan water.

119
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,436
Do your worst.

120
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,342
Absolutely no effect upon my...

121
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,959
Sir, maybe this Spuckler fellow

122
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,660
is a little smarter
than we thought.

123
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:14,962
Nonsense.

124
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:22,302
Perhaps it takes an idiot
to catch an idiot.

125
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,370
Hello!

126
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:24,505
Could I get a little help?

127
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,373
I dropped my sandwich in here.

128
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:31,478
You and Mr. Spuckler will enter
into what the hoi polloi

129
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,313
called a friendship,

130
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,682
then use that friendship
to destroy his life

131
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,084
from the inside out.

132
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,019
I don't know.
He's got kids.

133
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:41,922
I can't cheat a family
out of their home.

134
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:44,024
But you're perfectly fine

135
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:45,726
cheating me out of their home.

136
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,195
You're trying to confuse me.

137
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,564
I got to get out.
Where's the trap door?

138
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:53,233
Save me.

139
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,569
You know Weinstein
from Accounting.

140
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,038
If you're confused,

141
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:01,475
perhaps these two gentlemen
can clarify things.

142
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,044
This fellow loves
inflicting pain.

143
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,646
And this fellow loves to laugh

144
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,848
while he watches this one
produce the pain.

145
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,983
Are you the pain guy
or the laugh guy?

146
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,855
Answer the question.

147
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,862
Hello?

148
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:24,131
Maggie Simpson here
for a playdate.

149
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,699
Hudson's on a conference call.

150
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,267
I'll buzz you in.

151
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,971
You have a lovely home.

152
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,973
What is this floor made out of?

153
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,208
The tile was a Venetian church

154
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,711
which we dismantled,
shipped over by small boat

155
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:41,148
and had lovingly installed
by a 99-year-old I.M. Pei.

156
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,716
That sounds pricey.

157
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,885
No, the toilet is pricey.

158
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:48,221
The plumbers we hired to replace it
are very inefficient.

159
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,366
Let's go, you little runts.

160
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,935
What? Are your diapers full?

161
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,605
Would you like some coffee as
you fill out a sexual history?

162
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,106
Sexual history?

163
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:08,208
So our babies can be friends?

164
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,210
Here's mine.

165
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,448
All right.

166
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:17,117
Cream, no sugar.

167
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:27,027
So unusual to see a baby
with a pacifier these days.

168
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:33,967
Your baby has
such interesting hair.

169
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,071
You don't mind
that I babyproofed your baby

170
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,407
- from my baby, do you?
- Yes, I do.

171
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,275
Very much.

172
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,244
Maggie, let's go. Now.

173
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,879
And we're not coming back.

174
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,228
Whatcha doing there, friend?

175
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,397
Good to see you again.

176
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:06,333
- A-yup.
- A-yup.

177
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,201
Nothing like a good a-yup

178
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,537
- to put a man at ease.
- A-yup.

179
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:12,539
- A-yup.
- A-yup.

180
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,675
- A-yup.
- A-nope.

181
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,343
I mean, a-yup.

182
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,511
Say, friend,

183
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,513
looks like
you're working awful hard

184
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:23,116
to suck the helium
into them thar Mylar balloons.

185
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,951
Oh, it's powerful tiresome.

186
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,088
But the Lord done put helium
under my feet,

187
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,390
and I must not spill it
into the sky.

188
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:31,792
Now, listen.

189
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,728
Explain that you have a way
to make his life easier.

190
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,229
Pretend it's your idea.

191
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,231
He's stupid enough
to believe you have an idea.

192
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,100
Say, what if I told you

193
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,302
there was a way
to harvest that noble gas?

194
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:46,239
What if I told you there was
a way to harvest that noble gas

195
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,942
without the strain
on your mouth puffer.

196
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,610
I'd say, aw, pshaw,

197
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:53,246
but then I'd follow it
with a go on.

198
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,315
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

199
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,250
No, don't say excellent.

200
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:59,086
No, don't say excellent.

201
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,253
No, don't say that either.

202
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,489
No, don't say that either.

203
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,591
- Just shut up.
- Just shut up.

204
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:07,227
I'll have to mull your proposal,

205
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:10,263
especially that last crazy part.

206
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,101
You just saved me
a passel of work.

207
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:17,237
Now I can spend more time
making more family.

208
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:18,739
Homer J. Simpson.

209
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:22,275
Cletus Delroy Montfort
Bigglesworth Spuckler.

210
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,244
Now, let's go yonder

211
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,513
and get ourselves
a mess of catfish.

212
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,250
All right, I'm gonna get my arm
so deep into that catfish hole,

213
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:33,320
that ole chucklehead
just bites my bone.

214
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:37,090
Easy-peasy.

215
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,262
Now, don't scare him.
It sours up the flavor.

216
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,969
It's licking my eye.

217
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,206
Is it dead?

218
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,708
Thank you.

219
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,309
All right, nothing like

220
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:59,379
a good ole
Spuckler family fish fry.

221
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,315
Dear Lord,
thank you for bringing

222
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,317
this hairless swamp beast
our way.

223
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:08,421
His wisdom regarding
your mystery balloon gas

224
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,358
has helped us Spucklers
become a two-radio family.

225
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,693
Homer,
I want to be your partner.

226
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,363
Seal the deal
with a hillbilly handshake.

227
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:17,664
Come on.

228
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,835
I consider you family now,

229
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:25,405
which is not really
that select a circle.

230
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,393
Excellent.

231
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:47,894
Where'd that come from?

232
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:50,230
Well done, Simpson.
We'll take him for everything

233
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:51,898
except the couch on his lawn.

234
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:53,400
Well, but we're family.

235
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,869
Couldn't you
just screw him half over?

236
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:57,437
No one screws anyone half over.

237
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,406
It's like having
half a billion dollars.

238
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:00,407
What's the point of that?

239
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,476
What's up?

240
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:04,878
I think we're both upset,

241
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,880
but I'm worried
you're gonna talk first.

242
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,515
No, you go ahead.

243
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:11,518
I'm supposed to screw over a guy

244
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:12,853
that's only been nice to me.

245
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,754
I'm denying Maggie happiness

246
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:17,757
because I can't stand
the mother of her friend.

247
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,259
Maggie'll be fine.

248
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:20,594
I just played with her.

249
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,397
She still thinks
I've got her nose.

250
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,699
Wait, where'd I put it?

251
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,534
Not here.

252
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:28,835
No. No.

253
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:33,006
Oh, look what you found.

254
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,277
I have something
I need to tell you.

255
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,380
Hudson had a birthday party,

256
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:43,016
but I didn't tell you,
so you missed it.

257
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,553
I can explain.

258
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,955
That other mom
was just so annoying

259
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,758
with her aerial silks
and those yoga pants.

260
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:54,094
She does Pilates, not yoga.

261
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,263
She made me feel bad
about myself.

262
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,432
You get it, right? Right?

263
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:10,210
Get this contract signed,
Simpson.

264
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:11,711
Or what?

265
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,747
Perhaps you need a little taste
of what's in store.

266
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,218
Sorry, Smithers.

267
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,387
We didn't want to leave a mark
that Cletus could see.

268
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:22,422
But you could've
warned me first.

269
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:23,990
Fair enough. Watch your back.

270
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,598
Well, if it ain't
my bestest friend

271
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,433
on God's flat Earth.

272
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,435
So, what's in your hand?

273
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:38,438
Some sort
of a friendship certificate?

274
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:39,940
You know, just something

275
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:42,542
to put our partnership
on the up-and-up.

276
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,946
Hey, what's more up-and-up
than the helium business?

277
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:50,283
- Ain't you gonna read it?
- I trust you,

278
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,453
like a sheep
trusts a friendly wolf.

279
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:00,560
I signs with an X

280
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,530
'cause that's the kind
of iPhone I got.

281
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,899
And now for the second slash

282
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,400
that makes it official.

283
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,235
Oh, I need a straightedge.

284
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,638
Straight-Edge!
Get over here, boy!

285
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,707
Yes, Daddy.

286
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:16,910
I can't do it.

287
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:21,982
- You done floated my mark-maker.
- I won't

288
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,651
let you sign it. It's all
a trick to steal your helium.

289
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:28,655
You was gonna steal
from a man what has 29 kids?

290
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:30,824
30. 31!

291
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,226
Yeah, but I told you
before it was too late.

292
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:38,865
Okay, we're still buddies.

293
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:41,201
Getting mad
at city folk for lying

294
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,503
is like getting mad
at your six-year-old

295
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,238
for not cleaning her gun.

296
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,574
- Put her there.
- That's your left hand.

297
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,743
They's both left hands.

298
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,711
Simpson, you fool.

299
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:53,546
I hope you kissed your wife well
this morning,

300
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,415
because it will be the last one.

301
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:56,583
Well, it was a medium.

302
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,118
Part of it hit her ear.

303
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,488
Hey, you harm my friend,

304
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,523
you ain't getting balloon one
of my helium.

305
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,891
And I mean ever.

306
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,493
Quite the dilemma.

307
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,362
Smithers, solve this
if you don't want another kick.

308
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:10,864
Cletus, about your helium.

309
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,033
What if we paid you
a fair price?

310
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,001
County fair or state fair?

311
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:16,669
I can't lose
to someone so stupid.

312
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,238
Goons, get him.

313
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,081
We'll pay you what's right.

314
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:31,584
We have a deal. Have your people
call my basset hound.

315
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:35,088
Well, this'll help you forget
your billionaire troubles.

316
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,791
Have a toke on this, friend.

317
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:41,394
Help me! Help me!

318
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:42,595
You'll rue the day.

319
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,564
Smithers, power lines!

320
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,737
Oh, Maggie.

321
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:53,406
You're too young to be miserable
the rest of your life.

322
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:54,607
In this rom-com,

323
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,943
I am not going to be
the mean mother.

324
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,446
Let's go.

325
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:18,465
You know,
the one thing we have in common

326
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,066
is we're willing to pretend

327
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:22,469
that we like each other
for our children.

328
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,804
To that, I say, kiss-kiss.

329
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:57,003
<i>Ooh, we're sharing
some grits</i>

330
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,107
<i>Yours has butter,
mine has possum gravy</i>

331
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,776
<i>We're pals,
so I eat your weird food</i>

332
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:09,282
<i>Ooh, you're making me fat now,
Homer</i>

333
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:12,852
<i>I don't have long to live</i>

334
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:16,789
<i>Ooh, you're the best friend</i>

335
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,992
<i>That I ever had</i>

336
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:22,962
<i>You're the one
who keeps my balloons flyin'</i>

337
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:27,000
<i>You're my moonshine,
and I want you to know</i>

338
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,536
<i>That I'm not sniffing glue</i>

339
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:33,006
<i>I really love you</i>

340
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:37,544
<i>Oh, you're my best friend</i>

341
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:42,515
<i>Ooh, you gave me your tooth</i>

342
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:46,853
<i>I love that you're whittlin'
a stool for me</i>

343
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,857
<i>I need two,
one for each cheek</i>

344
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:55,094
<i>Two, you'll have 'em
next week, now, Homer</i>

345
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:59,866
<i>Cool, let's pee in the creek</i>

346
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:02,702
<i>Ooh, you're a mountain man</i>

347
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:05,371
<i>Who lives off the grid</i>

348
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:08,708
<i>You chased off Burns
with a shotgun</i>

349
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:10,710
<i>That was such fun</i>

350
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:13,413
<i>And I love to drink</i>

351
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,882
<i>The methanol</i>

352
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:19,085
<i>From your still</i>

353
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:23,189
<i>Ooh, you're my best friend</i>

354
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:26,192
<i>Ooh, you're my best friend</i>

355
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:30,763
<i>Ooh, I might not live</i>

356
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,801
<i>Ooh, you're my best friend.</i>
