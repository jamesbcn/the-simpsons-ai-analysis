00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,321
or I won't get that part.

180
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,204
Pull, you mighty stallions!

181
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,531
Pull! Show me no mercy.

182
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,618
Oh!

183
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,712
(alarm clock ringing)

184
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,086
Oh, I only grew
half an inch.

185
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,926
I'm still too short.

186
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,851
Growing half an inch in one day
is still pretty good, Bart.

187
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,061
Yeah, that's how fast
Grampa's shrinking.

188
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,311
Oh, I'm as tall
as I ever was.

189
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,353
Is there any way
I can look taller

190
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,437
without actually
being taller?

191
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,529
Good news,
gentlemen.

192
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,072
I've grown that extra
inch you wanted,

193
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,275
plus several feet more.

194
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,775
We've found our new Fallout Boy!

195
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,407
-(gasps)
-And he's right over there.

196
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,624
Huh?

197
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,793
Ladies and gentlemen,

198
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,252
meet America's new Fallout Boy.

199
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,753
(cheering)

200
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:06,923
Out of the way.

201
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,094
Milhouse, baby!

202
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,933
Lionel Hutz, your
new agent, bodyguard,

203
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,468
unauthorized biographer
and drug dealer...

204
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,933
keeper-awayer.

205
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:18,272
(screaming)

206
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,809
Leave me alone!

207
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,732
Mom! Dad!

208
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,271
Make them stop!

209
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,444
What is all this stuff?

210
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,236
We've heard
you've become a star.

211
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:33,069
We decided we better start
living in the fast lane.

212
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,695
What if I'm not a success?

213
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,742
How will you pay
for all this?

214
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,116
I'm sorry,
I can't hear you, son.

215
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,333
I'm wearing a jacuzzi suit.

216
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,374
(groans)

217
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,956
Oh! I just missed out

218
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,131
on the greatest opportunity
of my entire life.

219
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,671
George Burns was right.

220
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,424
Show business is
a hideous bitch goddess.

221
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,967
Cheer up, Bart.

222
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,800
Milhouse is still going
to need a true friend.

223
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,805
Someone to tell him he's great,
someone to rub lotion on him

224
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,598
someone he can hurl
whiskey bottles at

225
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,892
when he's feeling low.

226
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,345
You're right, Lis.
I can suck up to him

227
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,686
like the religious people
suck up to God.

228
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,731
(banging)

229
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,114
Guess what, kids?

230
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,940
They're gonna pay us
$50 a day

231
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,896
to film some
of the movie here.

232
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,106
We'll run that cable
through here.

233
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,240
Careful, now.

234
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,775
Hey...

235
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,948
Didn't you direct
"Unnatural Discretion"?

236
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,908
Well... yes, I did.

237
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,628
Hoo-wee!

238
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,458
Whoo! Oh!

239
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,303
You know, I never
walk out of a movie

240
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,298
but yech!

241
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,629
(clearing throat)

242
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,344
I've got an idea,
Mr. Simpson--

243
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,554
Why don't you get something
to eat from our food truck?

244
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,135
(distant panting)

245
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,469
Mr. Simpson?

246
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,060
You've got to give me
the part of "Krispy the Klown."

247
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,153
I'm sorry.
You're wrong for the part.

248
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,518
But look at my range.

249
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,069
I'm sorry. "Krispy the Klown"
has been cast

250
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,525
but I will hire you
for "Angry the Clown,"

251
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,786
"Silly Sailor,"
and "Dr. Clowneous."

252
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,751
I won't let you down.

253
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,169
Well, I might let you down
on "Silly Sailor."

254
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,049
Up and atom.

255
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,631
Up and at them.

256
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,636
Up and atom!

257
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,838
Up and at them!

258
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,598
Up and atom!

259
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,850
Up and at them!

260
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:22,891
Better.

261
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,643
Hi, Milhouse.

262
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,185
Hey, I want you to know

263
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,018
that I'm glad at least
one of us got the part.

264
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,148
Milhouse!

265
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,112
I didn't do it.
I wished him well.

266
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,692
I wished him well!

267
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,567
(screams)

268
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,164
The stupid dummy wasn't
supposed to explode yet.

269
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,200
(sighing)

270
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,372
There's the real Milhouse.

271
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,121
(tires screeching)

272
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,043
(gasping)
Milhouse!

273
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,212
Hey! You're not Milhouse.

274
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,330
No, I'm just Milhouse
when he gets hurt.

275
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,748
(groans)

276
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,706
Okay, let's get
the real Milhouse over here

277
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,506
under the X-ray truck.

278
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,469
Hi, Bart.

279
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,603
Hey, cool, Milhouse.

280
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,429
You get to be crushed
by a truck.

281
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,434
It sounds like more fun
than it really is.

282
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,477
Hey! I think I'm lying
on a broken bottle.

283
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,862
Beautiful! Use it.

284
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,858
{\an8}Okay, Fallout Boy
origin scene-- Take one.

285
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,281
Action!

286
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,819
(sizzling)

287
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,822
(grunting)

288
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,243
Up and at them.

289
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,951
Thanks for the help,
mysterious stranger.

290
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:25,792
Say, I think those X-rays
gave me super powers.

291
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,000
DIRECTOR: And, cut!

292
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,830
That was perfect.
Let's do it again.

293
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,995
Uh, these aren't
real x-rays, are they?

294
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,205
Good question!
We'll check into that.

295
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,086
Okay, X-ray machine
to full power

296
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,633
and... Action!

297
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,926
(sizzling)

298
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,062
Uh, sir, why don't you
just use real cows?

299
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,680
Cows don't look
like cows on film.

300
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,517
You got to use
horses.

301
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,602
What do you do
if you want something

302
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,186
that looks
like a horse?

303
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,272
Usually we just tape a
bunch of cats together.

304
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,607
You guys work
on the movie?

305
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,112
You saying
we're not working?

306
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,654
Oh, I always wanted
to be a teamster.

307
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,738
So lazy and surly.

308
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,033
Mind if I relax
next to you?

309
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,287
(yawning)

310
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:11,249
(yawning)

311
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,135
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

312
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,225
Oh, here he comes.

313
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,769
What is it now,
Quimby?

314
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,772
Nothing, nothing, only
the city has just passed

315
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,815
another tax
on puffy directing pants.

316
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,070
But I don't wear
puffy pants.

317
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,282
I meant a tax on
not wearing puffy pants.

318
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,284
-Oy!
-I'm sorry.

319
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,615
Wow! You really got it
made now, Milhouse.

320
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,116
This is living.

321
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,418
Is it, Bart?

322
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,421
Is it really?

323
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,673
Yeah.

324
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,634
Ever since I became
a movie star

325
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,174
I've been miserable.

326
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,588
I had to get up
at 5:00 a.m. just for makeup.

327
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,557
I like the way the blush
brings out my cheekbones

328
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,138
but it's not worth it.

329
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,933
And making movies
is so horribly repetitive.

330
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,687
I've said "Jiminy jillikers"
so many times

331
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,599
the words have lost
all meaning.

332
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,438
We've got to do the "Jiminy jillikers"
scene again, Milhouse.

333
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,534
(growling)
But we already did it.

334
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,399
It took seven hours,
but we did it.

335
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,487
It's done.

336
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,583
Yes, but we've got to do it
from different angles

337
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,039
again and again

338
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,159
and again
and again and again.

339
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,746
(screaming)

340
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:36,998
Yeah...

341
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,094
(sighing)

342
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,758
I can't believe Silly Sailor
beat us both up

343
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:49,723
and imprisoned us
in his floating aqua world.

344
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,175
Jiminy jillikers!

345
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,765
Tut-tut, now.

346
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,060
There's no need
for profanity, Fallout Boy.

347
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,975
Everyone in town has been
gouging us silly

348
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,523
but it's worth it.

349
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,437
It's all up there
on the screen.

350
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,935
Yes. That Milhouse
is going to be big.

351
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,528
Gabby Hayes big!

352
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,910
Okay, listen up, everybody.

353
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,992
This is the hardest,
most expensive scene in the movie,

354
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,367
and we only get one shot at it,
so we have to do it right.

355
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,166
Fallout Boy will untie
Radioactive Man

356
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,130
and pull him to safety
moments before he's hit

357
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:24,051
with a 40-foot wall
of sulfuric acid

358
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,051
that will horribly burn
everything in it's path.

359
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,394
Now, that's real acid, so
I want to see goggles, people.

360
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,102
Real acid?

361
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,232
Okay, roll film...

362
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,020
tip the acid vats...

363
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,063
and action!

364
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,320
(grunting)

365
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,531
Only Fallout Boy
can save me now.

366
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,819
Where's Fallout Boy?

367
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:51,908
(gasps)

368
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,908
Fallout Boy!

369
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,326
Uh-oh.

370
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,554
My eyes!

371
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,470
The goggles do nothing!

372
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,088
(crashing)

373
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,258
Ah, ooh! Ah!

374
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,477
Where in the hell is Milhouse?

375
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,771
That one shot cost us
a million dollars.

376
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,686
KRUSTY:
Where's the producer?

377
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,355
I want to talk
about this coffee.

378
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:46,956
Milhouse!

379
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,297
Milhouse!

380
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,472
-Milhouse!
-Milhouse!

381
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,590
Milhouse!

382
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,473
Thanks to modern
editing techniques,

383
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,886
we can use existing footage
to complete the film

384
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:58,845
without Milhouse.

385
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,519
Watch.

386
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,568
It looks like we're
in trouble, Fallout Boy.

387
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,281
Jiminy jillikers,
Radioactive Man.

388
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,112
We'll have to
fight our way out.

389
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,157
Are you ready?

390
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,660
Yes.

391
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,332
(grunting and groaning)

392
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,833
Seamless, huh?

393
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,334
-You're fired.
-And with good cause.

394
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,536
(sniffing)

395
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,585
(growling)

396
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,588
Go!

397
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,129
Okay. We can all
stop worrying now.

398
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,514
These dogs never fail.

399
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,971
But... will they
just find Milhouse

400
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,892
or will they find him
and kill him?

401
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,350
Well, they'll-- When they
find him, they'll, um...

402
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,642
(mumbling)

403
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,404
Uh, excuse me.

404
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,149
You didn't answer me.
You just trailed off.

405
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,190
Yeah.

406
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,114
Yeah, I did kind of
trail off there, didn't I?

407
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,565
I know Milhouse.

408
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,573
I'll just check
all his old haunts.

409
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,043
Have you seen Milhouse?

410
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,119
No. Now, go away.

411
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,214
We're racing
for the title

412
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,158
of the champion
of the universe.

413
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,461
All right.

414
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,338
Yo, Dr. S., have
you seen Milhouse today?

415
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,347
No.

416
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,348
Okay. Thanks.

417
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,719
Wait. Did you know

418
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,016
that there's a
direct correlation

419
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,229
between the decline
of Spirograph

420
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,518
and the rise in
gang activity?

421
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,641
-Think about it.
-I will.

422
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,437
No, you won't.

423
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,401
The only place left
is the tree house.

424
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,696
Aha!

425
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,372
Stay away from me, Bart.

426
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,040
I mean it.
I'm not going back.

427
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,079
I'm not cut out
to be a star.

428
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,212
But, Milhouse,
being a star

429
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,209
is every patriotic
American's dream.

430
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,251
Not mine.

431
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,844
It's a sham, Bart.

432
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,669
You get up on that movie screen
pretending to be a hero

433
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,585
but you're not.

434
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,724
The real heroes are out there,
toiling day and night

435
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,352
on more important things.

436
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,008
Television.

437
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:03,097
No. Curing heart disease
and wiping out world hunger.

438
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,353
But, Milhouse, they
haven't cured anything.

439
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,556
Heart disease and world hunger
are still rampant.

440
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,527
Those do-gooders are all
a bunch of pitiful losers,

441
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,108
every last one of them.

442
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,113
You want results,
you have to go

443
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,355
to the Schwarzeneggers,
the Stallones,

444
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,067
and to a lesser extent,
the Van Dammes.

445
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,959
BOTH: Mickey Rooney!

446
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,578
Hi, Milhouse.

447
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,075
The studio sent me
to talk to you

448
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,247
being a former child star myself

449
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,795
and the number-one
box office draw

450
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,510
from 1939 through 1940.

451
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,591
Wow, spanning two decades.

452
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,086
How'd you find us?

453
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,678
They tapped your
tree house phone.

454
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,353
(radio signal beeping)

455
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,103
Milhouse, listen, you
can't quit this movie.

456
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,646
I've seen your work.

457
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,689
It's good,
very, very good.

458
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,482
Van Johnson good.

459
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,146
I know I'm good.

460
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,074
Movie stardom
is just so hollow.

461
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,823
Hollow?!

462
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,445
The only thing in
show business that's hollow

463
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,782
is the music industry.

464
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,197
Come on, Milhouse.

465
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,575
You have to do this,
if not for yourself

466
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,412
then for the movie-going public

467
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,207
and for the foreign markets

468
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,881
that are more important
than ever nowadays,

469
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:17,550
and finally,
for me, the Mickster.

470
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,683
No.

471
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,339
All right. I tried.

472
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,597
Fortunately, we have

473
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,848
a perfectly good
Fallout Boy right here.

474
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,639
Jiminy jillikers.
Jiminy jillikers.

475
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,807
Jiminy jillikers.

476
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,895
We're shutting
down production.

477
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,610
Yeah. Well, we only
have $1,000 left, anyway.

478
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,441
Uh, there's a $1,000
leaving-town tax.

479
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,742
MICKEY: Well, I hope
you're all satisfied.

480
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:44,123
You bankrupted a bunch
of naive movie folks.

481
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,581
Folks from Hollywood,
where values are different.

482
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,673
They weren't thinking
about the money.

483
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,878
They just wanted
to tell a story,

484
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,959
a story about
a radioactive man

485
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,674
and you slick small-towners

486
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,464
took them for all
they were worth.

487
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,967
(whimpers)

488
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,841
Should we give them
some of their money back?

489
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,640
No.

490
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,177
Hurry, Mr. Rooney.

491
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,177
We've got
a disenchanted little girl

492
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,638
in a Jell-O pudding commercial.

493
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:11,937
I could play that.

494
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,396
So, Milhouse, it
must be a little tough

495
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,693
giving up all
that glamour

496
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,026
and coming back
to school, huh?

497
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,951
Quiet. Maybe I
can get my citizenship.

498
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,196
(cheering)

499
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,040
We know you don't have
any more money left

500
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,582
but that doesn't matter.

501
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,995
Just take whatever you need
from our boutiques

502
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,964
until you can get back
on your feet.

503
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,054
Thank God we're back
in Hollywood

504
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,470
