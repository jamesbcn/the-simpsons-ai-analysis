is called
post-traumatic elation.

00:03:59,478 --> 00:04:01,348

76
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:03,819
Damn it, man,
you are literally in the middle

77
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:05,591
of a car accident!

78
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:09,031
What?! Oh, right.

79
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:10,371
Let me lay this out.

80
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:12,397
You and me are gonna use
this car ejection

81
00:04:12,404 --> 00:04:15,384
for some self-reflection,
okay, my brother?

82
00:04:15,377 --> 00:04:16,407
And that journey begins with

83
00:04:16,412 --> 00:04:17,922
finding the source
of your anger.

84
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:22,016
Now, gaze into that
little piece of glass.

85
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:26,527

Want to know why?

86
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,373
Well, that's why I got into
banking in the first place,

87
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:31,139
for the thrilling stories.

88
00:04:31,142 --> 00:04:33,482
Well, this morning,
I was on my break

89
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,720
- at the nuclear power plant...
- Uh-huh.

90
00:04:34,716 --> 00:04:37,186
...so I went and got myself
a bag of chips.

91
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:39,387
Potato chips.

92
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:41,561
I feel like I'm at
a story slam right now.

93
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:44,203
They were so delicious
and salty and chompy,

94
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,771
and before long,
they were all gone.

95
00:04:46,773 --> 00:04:47,373
- No.
- Almost.

96
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:49,914
Oh, there's a twist?

97
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:52,323
But then I pulled out this,

98
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:55,487
a chip that looks exactly like
John Travolta.

99
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,360
And that's why I need
a safe-deposit box,

100
00:04:58,363 --> 00:05:01,503
to protect this treasure forever.

101
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:05,439
Oh, don't study opera staging
in Vienna, they said.

102
00:05:05,443 --> 00:05:07,983
Work in a bank, they said.

103
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,090
Mm-hmm. Mr. Simpson,
it looks like your family

104
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:15,362
already has a safe-deposit box.

105
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:18,303
Your wife rented it out
over a decade ago.

106
00:05:18,303 --> 00:05:21,143
- Wow, you've got a wife.
- Wha?

107
00:05:21,142 --> 00:05:22,082
Now, I'm not supposed to
show you this,

108
00:05:22,077 --> 00:05:25,477
but lucky for you right now
I'm super high.

109
00:05:25,483 --> 00:05:28,863
"Last will and testament"?

110
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:31,358
Written by Clarence Bouvier,
your father-in-law.

111
00:05:31,362 --> 00:05:34,372
Marge's dad left a will?

112
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:35,238
He never told me about that

113
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:37,977
in the four conversations
we ever had.

114
00:05:37,976 --> 00:05:39,576
It says here he set up a trust

115
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:42,549
to pay Marge Simpson,
ooh, $1,000 a month.

116
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:47,032
A thousand dollars? What? No.

117
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:47,727
No! What?!

118
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:50,969
No! No? What?

119
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:52,198
No.

120
00:05:52,204 --> 00:05:53,874
And I can confirm that
your wife has been

121
00:05:53,874 --> 00:05:56,884
receiving that money every month
since her father died.

122
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,390
Marge has been getting
all that money for years,

123
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:01,255
and she never told me about it.

124
00:06:01,255 --> 00:06:03,525
I-I don't know what to feel.

125
00:06:03,527 --> 00:06:05,457
In these situations,
many of our customers

126
00:06:05,463 --> 00:06:06,773
opt for extreme rage.

127
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:10,067
Well, I hate to just
follow the crowd, but...

128
00:06:10,073 --> 00:06:10,913
(growling angrily)

129
00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:13,678
(grumbling, muttering)

130
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:17,723
So that's why I was so mad.

131
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:19,262
And that's why
I'm even angrier now.

132
00:06:19,258 --> 00:06:23,198
For all these years, Marge has
been hiding money from me.

133
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,409
It's a blatant act of, of, uh...

134
00:06:26,405 --> 00:06:28,635
The term is
"financial infidelity."

135
00:06:28,644 --> 00:06:31,254
And I can see how
you'd be angry.

136
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:32,279
Oh, thank you.

137
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:33,924
- But it's the wrong emotion
to feel.
- Damn it.

138
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:36,431
Homer, I'm gonna help you
work through this anger

139
00:06:36,425 --> 00:06:39,265
so you can find peace.

140
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,965
Aw, work? That sounds like work.

141
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,510
How much time do I have?

142
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:44,677
I'd say about
point-three seconds

143
00:06:44,776 --> 00:06:47,546
- judging by how fast
you're flying towards that tree.
- Aah!

144
00:06:47,548 --> 00:06:51,188
Oh, my God, we're airborne.

145
00:06:51,188 --> 00:06:53,088
- Whoa!
- (all scream)

146
00:06:58,336 --> 00:07:00,406
I don't know which one
I'm more upset about,

147
00:07:00,407 --> 00:07:01,577
that my wife has been keeping

148
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:03,176
a secret mountain of cash
from me,

149
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:06,319
or that I'm about to die
in a stupid, violent car wreck.

150
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,419
Don't make me choose,
Goobie-Woo.

151
00:07:08,423 --> 00:07:10,363
(Homer crying out)

152
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,460
Homer, you're spiraling.

153
00:07:11,462 --> 00:07:13,672
Of course I'm spiraling.

154
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,167
I'm literally flying
through the air.

155
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:18,542
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

156
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:21,754
Listen, I know you're feeling
all the feels right now,

157
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,750
but we're getting closer
to the real source of your rage.

158
00:07:23,754 --> 00:07:27,734
What? I'm sorry,
I'm eating my feelings.

159
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:30,799
Bad Homer. Spit out that food,
and those feelings.

160
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:33,671
(grunts) What was Marge
spending that money on?

161
00:07:33,674 --> 00:07:36,484
And why did she keep it a secret
from everybody?

162
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,619
LISA:
Um, not everybody, Dad.

163
00:07:38,617 --> 00:07:40,517
I hate to say it,
but we've known about

164
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:42,631
Mom's secret cash
for quite some time.

165
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,625
Yeah, that's why I laugh myself
to sleep every night.

166
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,271
What? And here I've been
worried sick about

167
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:49,469
your night giggles.

168
00:07:49,471 --> 00:07:51,681
Let me tell you
how we found out.

169
00:07:51,677 --> 00:07:54,817
<i>I was blowing off steam
one day...</i>

170
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:03,131
<i>...and I saw that Mom was
getting $100,000 a month!</i>

171
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:05,912
<i>LISA:
Then I explained to Bart
how decimal points work.</i>

172
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,350
<i>Then we asked Mom about it,
and she admitted</i>

173
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:12,819
the whole thing.

174
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:17,129
So then tell me, why did she
keep the money a secret?

175
00:08:17,127 --> 00:08:18,527
I don't think you can handle it.

176
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,000
- I can handle it.
- Okay.

177
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:22,342
<i>The reason is...</i>

00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,816
poignantly unaware of
the finality of death.

188

Give me your best guess.

196

the benefit of the doubt,

197

Closure-closure,
closure-closure.

271
00:11:59,872 --> 00:12:02,442
Oh, no. I got to know
what Marge's dad did,

272
00:12:02,444 --> 00:12:03,484
or said or rapped.

273
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:07,919
Aha, and I've got
the magical footage right here.

274
00:12:07,922 --> 00:12:10,132
Don't look at it!
You've come so far.

275
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:12,796
Inner peace has almost defeated
your outer rage.

276
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,038
You've got to be strong, man.

277
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:17,266
So if I look at
that piece of glass,

278
00:12:17,274 --> 00:12:18,644
I could change my fate

279
00:12:18,644 --> 00:12:20,554
and perhaps even risk
my very soul?

280
00:12:20,547 --> 00:12:23,247
Well, I'm cool with that.

281
00:12:23,252 --> 00:12:23,952
What the hell?!

282
00:12:24,054 --> 00:12:26,834
But, Dad,
Homer has a good heart,

283
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:28,996
and I'm going to marry him.

284
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:30,897
Oh, honey, this Simpson fellow
will never provide for you.

285
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:33,741
He has jackass written
all over him.

286
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,450
Marge, do you have
any turpentine?

287
00:12:36,445 --> 00:12:38,275
It's not coming off.

288
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,493
Hmm.

289
00:12:40,486 --> 00:12:43,756
His friends did that
after he fell asleep at a party.

290
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,630
Homer's the sweetest person
I've ever met.

291
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,173
Every time I look into his eyes,

292
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:51,609
I see someone who will
never stop loving me.

293
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,550
Oh... crap.

294
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:57,019
Look, I'm gonna leave you
something special in my will

295
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,760
to make sure you're okay,
because you've found

296
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:00,657
every father's worst nightmare:

297
00:13:00,661 --> 00:13:04,841
true love with a true loser.

298
00:13:04,836 --> 00:13:07,806
Loser? But I thought
Marge's dad liked me.

299
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:09,678
He was always warning me about

300
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,749
doors hitting my butt
on the way out.

301
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,850
How dare he emasculate me
from beyond the grave?

302
00:13:13,854 --> 00:13:17,604
Uh-huh. I told you
not to look at it.

303
00:13:17,595 --> 00:13:19,325
Wait, how could I remember
that talk

304
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,141
between Marge and her dad
if I wasn't around to see it?

305
00:13:22,137 --> 00:13:25,437
You can see stuff like that
'cause you're a ghost now.

306
00:13:25,443 --> 00:13:27,283
You dead.

307
00:13:28,717 --> 00:13:30,187
(ghostlike):
D'oh...!

308
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:31,956
I tried to tell you,
and you didn't want to hear me.

309
00:13:31,956 --> 00:13:35,796
You was eating your feelings
and carrying on.

310
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:38,168
Goobie-Woo knows what's good.

311
00:13:39,004 --> 00:13:41,384

00:15:23,412 --> 00:15:25,552
- in a lake of blood.
- All right.

350
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:26,791
Just wait over there.

351
00:15:26,786 --> 00:15:29,386
Oh, there's a line?

352
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:33,031
Hey, do you mind if
I go ahead of you?

353
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,072
Yeah, in fact, I do mind.

354
00:15:38,142 --> 00:15:41,652
Oh, for... Oh... (groaning)

355
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:45,561
Fine, take this buzzer.

356
00:15:45,557 --> 00:15:46,987
When we're ready for you,
it'll electrocute you

357
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:48,903
and set your torso aflame!

358
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:51,937
I know how buzzers work.

359
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:54,881
(people screaming, crying out)

360
00:15:54,876 --> 00:15:58,146
Ooh, poker.

361
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:00,519
Oh, boy, I got-a the best hand.

362
00:16:00,521 --> 00:16:01,891
I'm-a gonna win.

363
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:02,890
Ha! Nice bluff, Benito.

364
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:05,802
(laughter)

365
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:09,607
Marge's dead dad!

366
00:16:09,605 --> 00:16:12,135
(grunting)

367
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:14,253
You thought
I wasn't worthy of Marge.

368
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:15,977
I'll kill you
and send you to super-hell!

369
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:17,964
Hey, hey, behave yourself.

370
00:16:17,955 --> 00:16:20,585
We have standards here.

371
00:16:20,594 --> 00:16:22,164
Shut up, Tom Selleck!

372
00:16:22,163 --> 00:16:24,203
What Marge's dad did to me
was super-sucky.

373
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:27,271
It's probably the reason
he ended up here.

374
00:16:27,273 --> 00:16:29,013
Actually, he ended up here
thanks to an unrelated

375
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,250
check forging scheme.

376
00:16:31,248 --> 00:16:34,318
Checks. Remember them?
(chuckles)

377
00:16:34,321 --> 00:16:36,121
Oh, crazy.

378
00:16:36,124 --> 00:16:38,104
Homer, uh, let's you and me
take a walk.

379
00:16:38,095 --> 00:16:41,025
Walking?
Oh, this really is hell.

380
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:43,574
- I want to show you something.
- (man groaning)

381
00:16:45,777 --> 00:16:47,547
Wow, another screen?

382
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:51,218
Yeah, this is hell.
Screens everywhere.

383
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:54,531
Mom, Dad, I'd like you
to meet Mercer.

384
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:56,099
He designs board games.

385
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,238
Oh, like Parker Brothers?

386
00:16:58,235 --> 00:17:01,135
(laughs)
Yeah, like Parker Brothers. No.

387
00:17:01,141 --> 00:17:04,381
You actually play that
mainstream corporate garbage?

388
00:17:04,381 --> 00:17:07,121
You're so lucky
to be meeting me today.

389
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,120
Seriously, I am
so jealous of you.

390
00:17:09,124 --> 00:17:10,364
Check this out.

391
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:13,299
My new game
is gonna be a huge hit.

392
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,344
It combines the Stratego-ness
of Stratego,

393
00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:19,608
the implicit sexual tension
of Twister,

394
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:22,922
and the hard-driving whimsy
of Tic-Tac-Toe.

395
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:25,058
It's called Side-gammon.

396
00:17:25,056 --> 00:17:28,156
Who's up for a game? Huh?

397
00:17:29,397 --> 00:17:31,027
Oh, come on!

398
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:32,404
It's super complicated!

399
00:17:32,403 --> 00:17:34,373
You'll be out
before you know it,

400
00:17:34,374 --> 00:17:36,414
and you'll be humiliated!

401
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:38,951
(growls angrily) Excuse me,
I have to go yell something

402
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,260
into your washer-dryer.

403
00:17:41,255 --> 00:17:44,325
He really is brilliant,
and he has a good heart.

404
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:45,727
- I'm going to marry him.
- (door closes)

405
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,041
MERCER (in other room):
I'm the Mozart of board games

406
00:17:48,035 --> 00:17:49,065
and novelties!

407
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,440
Why, that guy's a total loser.

408
00:17:52,443 --> 00:17:54,413
I don't want him to marry Lisa.

409
00:17:54,414 --> 00:17:57,394
Wait, I was never as bad
as him, was I?

410
00:17:57,387 --> 00:18:00,457
(chuckles)
Actually, there was a time

411
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:02,129
when I would have preferred
that guy to you.

412
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,530
Plus, you know what?

413
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:05,303
We got an advance copy
of Side-gammon,

414
00:18:05,303 --> 00:18:07,683
- and it's not bad.
- Oh, my God.

415
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:10,305
I'm starting to see things
from another point of view.

416
00:18:10,313 --> 00:18:11,553
Your point of view.

417
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,549
I didn't even know
other people had those.

418
00:18:13,553 --> 00:18:15,563
You were just worried
about Marge,

419
00:18:15,557 --> 00:18:17,227
the way I'd be worried
about Lisa.

420
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:20,126
No matter how old
and dead we get,

421
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:23,072
we just want to make sure
our little girls are okay.

422
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:25,642
- (buzzer buzzing)
- D'oh!

423
00:18:25,644 --> 00:18:28,124
<i>FEMALE ANNOUNCER:
Homer Simpson,
we are now ready</i>

424
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:30,285
<i>to boil you for eternity
in a lake of blood.</i>

425
00:18:30,286 --> 00:18:34,226
Wow, suddenly
that doesn't sound so good.

426
00:18:34,227 --> 00:18:36,567
(angelic choir sings)

427
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:38,266
Eh, you just had
an epiphany, pally,

428
00:18:38,268 --> 00:18:39,508
which means you get
to go back to your life.

429
00:18:39,505 --> 00:18:44,005
It's a dumb rule, but we need
a two-thirds vote to change it.

430
00:18:44,014 --> 00:18:45,584
Which is also a dumb rule.

431
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:47,664
What can I say?
Hell ain't perfect.

432
00:18:47,655 --> 00:18:49,825
Homer, you're getting
another chance.

433
00:18:49,825 --> 00:18:53,365
Now, get the hell out of hell
and go back to my daughter.

434
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,735
You heard the man.
Let's get your ass home.

435
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:57,369
(angelic choir sings)

436
00:18:59,578 --> 00:19:01,108
BOTH:
Ow!

437
00:19:01,114 --> 00:19:03,724
- Damn, that hurt.
- (groans)

438
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:08,561
You died and went to hell.

439
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:09,933
Ralph knows.

440
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:11,642
Whee!

441
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:14,469
Thank you, Goobie-Woo.

442
00:19:14,474 --> 00:19:17,084
I learned more
tumbling through the air

443
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,950
than I ever did
tumbling through my life.

444
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:22,162
- (tires screech)
- (siren whoops)

445
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:27,199
- (gasps) Dad!
- Homer!

446
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,210
Goobie-Woo. (giggles)

447
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,908
Oh, Homie,
thank God you're okay.

448
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:35,883
(Homer groaning)

449
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:41,259
Homer, I have to ask you,

450
00:19:41,261 --> 00:19:44,901
why did you send me
that angry text?

451
00:19:47,206 --> 00:19:48,336
It doesn't matter.

452
00:19:48,342 --> 00:19:50,352
I have since set aside
my own ego

453
00:19:50,346 --> 00:19:52,676
and learned to savor
my many blessings.

454
00:19:52,684 --> 00:19:56,434
And you, my darling,
are foremost amongst them.

455
00:19:56,425 --> 00:19:59,295
I don't understand
a thing he's saying.

456
00:19:59,297 --> 00:20:01,767
(shouting gibberish)

457
00:20:03,873 --> 00:20:05,883
He seems to be in a lot of pain.

458
00:20:05,877 --> 00:20:07,607
Can't you give him something?

459
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:08,524
Absolutely not.

460
00:20:08,516 --> 00:20:09,686
No can do till we get
to the hospital.

461
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:12,955
(groaning)

462
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,358
(Marge sighs)

463
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,614
(sighs):
Ah.

464
00:20:19,605 --> 00:20:22,875
I guess I can go another month
without a new purse.

You see, I'm a projection
of your psyche,

474
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:47,391

Now we should move on
to the part

477
00:20:51,936 --> 00:20:53,766
where your character slaps Dad.

478
00:20:53,773 --> 00:20:55,113
Wait a minute,
isn't that just a sound effect?

479
00:20:55,109 --> 00:20:58,819
No, it's got to be real.
Right, Lizzo?

480
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:03,127
Uh, seems a bit excessive to me,
but, hey, pshh, you're the kid.

481

You know what?
If you're uncomfortable,

482
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:07,429
- you don't have to do it.
- (Homer sighs)

483
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,773
I could do it for you.
And action!
