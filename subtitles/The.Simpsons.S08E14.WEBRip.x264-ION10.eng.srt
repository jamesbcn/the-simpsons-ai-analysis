{\an8}Hey, shut up!

32
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,437
You're here 'cause your
Itchy & Scratchy cartoons

33
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,026
are stinking up
my ratings.

34
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,111
Look at this breakdown
of yesterday's show.

35
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,236
Uh... Uh...

36
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,532
Eeyah... Kaboom.

37
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,905
What happened here?

38
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,581
Lightning hit
the transmitter?

See, that's what I thought
at first...

00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,661
Hey, shut up!

41
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:05,036
That crater is where your
lousy cartoon crash-landed!

42
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,625
It's ratings poison!

43
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,499
But Itchy & Scratchy
is critically acclaimed.

44
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,507
Acclaimed?

(spits)

46
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,682
I ought to replace it right now

where the robots
turn into... Blingwads!

48

But I'm a lazy,
lazy man, Roger.

49
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,102
So I'll give you
one more chance.

00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,944
Now, get out!

51
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,899
Don't come back till you've
fixed Itchy & Scratchy.

and I'll come back later.

57
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,833
I need to purchase

wander around

60
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,536
and meet you back here
later?

61
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,047

like to come with me?

-Sounds good to me. Let's go.

in our focus group, kids.

to show you some

66

cartoons.

00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,686
Cool!

69
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:11,863
We want you to tell us
what you think

70
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,781
and be honest because

71
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,990
no one from the show
is here spying on you.

72
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,820
(muffled sneeze)

73
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,366
Why is that
mirror sneezing?

74
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,989
Uh, look, it's just
an old, creaky mirror.

75
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,866
Sometimes it sounds
a little like it's

76
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,003
sneezing or coughing
or talking softly.

77
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,500
Hmm...

78
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,793
Now you each have a knob
in front of you.

79
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,008
When you like what you see,
turn the knob to the right.

80
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:38,089
When you don't like
what you see, turn it left.

81
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,596
My knob tastes funny.

82
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,218

tasting the knob.

would like Itchy & Scratchy

to deal with
real-life problems

93
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,255
like the ones
you face every day?

94
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,552
-I would!
-Great idea! Yeah, that's it!

95
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,386
And who would like to see them
do just the opposite,

96
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,222
getting into
far-out situations

97
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,597

-Cool!
-Yeah, that's I want!

100
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:35,651
So, you want a realistic,
down-to-earth show...

101
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,153
that's completely
off the wall

102
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,025
and swarming
with magic robots.

103
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,662
-That's right.
-Yeah, good.

104
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,408
And also, you should
win things by watching.

(sighs)

106
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,286
You kids don't know
what you want!

107
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,960
That's why you're still kids--
'cause you're stupid!

108
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,749
Just tell me what's wrong
with the freakin' show!

109
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,462

111
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,169
Um, excuse me, sir.

112
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,428
The thing is, there's not
really anything wrong

with "The Itchy
and Scratchy Show."

114
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,307
It's as good as ever.

115
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,058
But after so many years,

116
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,940
the characters just can't have
the same impact they once had.

117
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,769
That's it.

118
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,694
That's it,
little girl!

119
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,072
You've saved
"Itchy & Scratchy"!

120
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,609
Please sign these papers

121
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,742
indicating you did not
save "Itchy & Scratchy."

122
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,949
I have figured out

123
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,530
how to rejuvenate the show.

124
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,374
It is so simple

125
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,660
you egghead writers
would've never thought of it.

126
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,794
What we need is...

127
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,331
a new character!

128
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,624
One that today's kids
can relate to!

129
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,343
Are you absolutely sure
that's wise, sir?

130
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,710
I don't want to sound
pretentious here, but...

131
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,297
Itchy & Scratchy
comprise a dramaturgical dyad.

132
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,013
Hey, this ain't art;
it's business!

133
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,303
What do you got in mind?

134
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,256
Sexy broad?
Gangster octopus?

135
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,507
No... No.

136
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,888
The animal chain
of command goes

137
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,095
mouse, cat, dog.

138
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,937
D-O-G.

139
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,522
Uh, a dog?
Isn't that a tad predictable?

140
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,148
In your dreams.

141
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,534
We're talking
the original dog from hell.

142
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,492
You mean Cerberus?

143
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,834
We at the network
want a dog with attitude.

144
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,579
He's edgy.
He's in your face.

145
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,910
You've heard the expression
"Let's get busy"?

146
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,286
Well, this is a dog
who gets biz-zay...

147
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,245
consistently and thoroughly.

148
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,285
So, he's proactive, huh?

149
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,998
Oh, God, yes.

150
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,718
We're talking about
a totally outrageous paradigm.

151
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,049
Excuse me, but "proactive"
and "paradigm"--

152
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,505
Aren't these just buzzwords

153
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,505
that dumb people use
to sound important?

154
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,517
Not that I'm accusing you
of anything like that.

155
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,850
I'm fired, aren't I?

156
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:34,885
Oh, yes.

157
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,227
The rest of you writers

158
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,152
start thinking up a name
for this funky dog.

159
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,571
I don't know, something along
the lines of, say... "Poochie"

160
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,780
only more proactive.

161
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,320
Yeah!

162
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,158
-(door slams)
-So, "Poochie" okay with everybody?

163
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,122
-Yeah.
-Yeah. You know, it's good.

164
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,751
No, no, no.

165
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,252
He was supposed
to have attitude.

166
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,384
Um, wh-what do
you mean, exactly?

167
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:04,222
Oh, you know,
attitude, attitude!

168
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,258
Uh... Sunglasses!

169
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,762
Can we put him in more
of a hip-hop context?

170
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,345
Forget context.
He's got to be a surfer.

171
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,061
Give me a nice shmear
of surfer.

172
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,561
I feel we should
rasta-fy him by 10% or so.

173
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,229
Mm.

174
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,357
I think he needs
a little more attitude.

175
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,412
-Oh, yeah, bingo.
-Yeah!

176
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,739
-There it is, right there. That's it.
-I love it.

177
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,412
Hey, Lis, look,

178
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,705
they're adding a new character
to "Itchy & Scratchy"!

179
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,329
Poochie the Dog?

180
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,456
Adding a new character
is often a desperate attempt

181
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,043
to boost low ratings.

182
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,628
Yo, yo! How's it hanging,
everybody?

183
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,094
Morning, Roy.

184
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,514
Yeah, hi, Roy.

185
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,972
Hey! They're having
open casting

186
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,471
for the voice of Poochie.

187
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,803
You should try out, Dad.

188
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,388
-You have a funny voice.
-I do not!

189
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,644
Haven't you ever listened to
yourself on a tape recorder?

190
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,436
I prefer to listen
to Cheap Trick.

191
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,479
Well, here,
say something.

192
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,903
Hey... This is
Homer Simpson saying

193
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,862
howdy to all the girls
out there in radio-land.

194
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,494
(tape rewinding)

195
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,161
<i>Hey, this is</i>
<i>Homer Simpson saying...</i>

196
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,530
Ah! I don't sound
like that, do I?

197
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:17,618
Oh... I don't like having
such a hilarious voice.

198
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,625
That hilarious voice could be
your ticket to stardom.

199
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,178
Whoa, a talking dog!

200
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,888
(chuckles)

201
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,848
What were you guys smoking
when you came up with that?

202
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,060
We were eating
rotisserie chicken.

203
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,980
Can you just
read the line, please?

204
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,519
"Ruff, ruff!

205
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,482
I am Poochie,
the Rockin' Dog!"

206
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,943
You're perfect!

207
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,943
In fact,
you're better than perfect!

208
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,735
Next to you,
perfection is crap.

209
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:52,319
"Ruff, ruff! I'm Poochie,
the Rockin' Dog!"

210
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,406
Hi. I'm Troy McClure.

211
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,332
You may remember me
from such cartoons

212
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,790
as "Christmas Ape"

213
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,580
And "Christmas Ape
Goes to Summer Camp."

214
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,785
You're even better
than this guy!

215
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,335
Take a hike, you bum.

216
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,588
(grumbles)

217
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,050
(clears throat)
"Ruff, ruff!

218
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,090
I'm Poochie,
the Rockin' Dog!"

219
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:14,014
Now, that's just bad. You got no attitude,
you're barely outrageous

220
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,055
and I don't know what you're in,
but it's not my face.

221
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,518
Next.

222
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:21,518
Oh, no attitude, eh?
Not in your face, huh?

223
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,152
Well, you can cram it
with walnuts, ugly!

224
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,900
That's it,
that's the Poochie attitude!

225
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,532
Do that again.

226
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,028
Huh? I can't.
I don't remember what I did.

227
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,111
Then you don't get the job.
Next!

228
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,696
Oh, I don't
get the job, do I?

229
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,992
Well, boo-hoo...

230
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,196
I don't get to be
a cartoon dog.

231
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,538
That's it!
You've got the job!

232
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,923
Oh, now
I got the job, huh?

233
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:46,882
Oh. Thank you.

234
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,261
Okay, Homer,

235
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,971
let's get a level check
on your voice.

236
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:59,271
She smells sheet smells
by the sheet store.

237
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,678
Wait, wait.
Let me try it again.

238
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,636
Relax, Homer.
You'll do fine.

239
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,057
I'm June Bellamy.

240
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,855
I do the voices
of Itchy and Scratchy.

241
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:09,148
You?
But you're a lady.

242
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,653
(as Itchy)
She's a lady, all right.

243
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,275
(as Scratchy)
A beautiful lady.

244
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,282
(laughing)

245
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,954
Hey, that really is you.

246
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,794
How'd you get
to be so good?

247
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,949
Oh, just experience,
I suppose.

248
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,498
I started out
as Roadrunner.

249
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,711
-(as Roadrunner): Meep!
-You mean meep-meep?

250
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,791
No, they only paid me
to say it once

251
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,667
then they doubled it up
on the soundtrack.

252
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,054
Cheap bastards.

253
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,300
-You folks ready to begin?
-Uh, I guess.

254
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,222
Is this episode going
on the air live?

255
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,641
No, Homer.

256
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,599
Very few cartoons
are broadcast live.

257
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,559
It's a terrible strain
on the animator's wrist.

258
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,244
Hi, question
for Miss Bellamy.

259
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,031
In episode 2f09

260
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,454
when Itchy plays Scratchy's
skeleton like a xylophone

261
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,913
he strikes the same rib
twice in succession

262
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,084
yet he produces
two clearly different tones.

263
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,584
I mean, what are we to believe
that this is some sort of...

264
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,627
(derisive snort)

265
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,500
Magic xylophone
or something?

266
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,377
Boy, I really hope somebody
got fired for that blunder.

267
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,675
Uh, well, uh...

268
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,508
I'll field this one.

269
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,973
Let me ask you a question.

270
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,723
Why would a man whose shirt
says "Genius at work"

271
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,886
spend all of his time watching
a children's cartoon show?

272
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,847
I withdraw my question.

273
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,481
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. Simpson.

274
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,646
On the "Itchy
& Scratchy" CD-ROM

275
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,486
is there a way to get
out of the dungeon

276
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,282
without using
the wizard key?

277
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,776
What the hell
are you talking about?

278
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,077
You're a lifesaver, Homer.

279
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,910
I can't deal with
these hardcore fans.

280
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,666
(clears throat)
Your attention, please!

281
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:49,749
MAN:
Uh, in episode--

282
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,294
Eh, your attention, please!

283
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,128
Mr. Simpson
will now be autographing

284
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,473
8-by-10 glossies of Poochie.

285
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,759
One per customer.

286
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,053
Please form a line.
There will be no cutting.

287
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,387
I'm talking to you,
Mr. Cutter.

288
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,772
Pardon me. Look out.

289
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,639
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Hot soup.

290
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,517
Hi. Kindly make
one out to me

291
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,273
and three out to my friend
of the same name.

292
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,776
MARGE: I'm so glad
you could join us

293
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,069
for Homer's big premiere.

294
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,992
BARNEY:
Poochie's based on me.

295
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,280
Is this seat taken,
little girl?

296
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,584
I'm not a girl.
Are you blind?

297
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,828
Yes.

298
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,789
I am stoked, Mr. S.

299
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,660
Shh. Everybody,
it's coming on.

I can honestly say

348
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,880
that was the best episode
of "Impy and Chimpy"

349
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,301
I've ever seen.

350
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,709
Yeah, you should be
very proud, Homer.

351
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:45,257
You, uh... You got
a beautiful home here.

352
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:55,348
So, it was
pretty okay, huh?

353
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,806
Mom, can we go to bed
without dinner?

354
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,056
Yes, we can.

355
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,478
(doors slam)

356
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,226
Well,
at least I liked it.

357
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,608
Didn't I?

358
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,855
HOMER'S BRAIN: <i>Oh, you don't want</i>
<i>to know what I really think.</i>

359
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,447
<i>Now,</i>
<i>look sad and say "D'oh."</i>

360
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,043
D'oh.

361
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,828
I'm the worst
Poochie ever.

362
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,287
No, it's not
your fault, Dad.

363
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,746
You did fine.

364
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,586
It's just that
Poochie was a soulless

365
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,551
by-product
of committee thinking.

366
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,882
You can't be cool
just by spouting

367
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,676
a bunch of
worn-out buzzwords.

368
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,890
Don't have a cow, Lis.

369
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,139
Bart's right.

370
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,390
Let's none of us
have a cow.

371
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,773
All that matters

372
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,729
is that the fans
of the show liked it.

373
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,809
Last night's
"Itchy & Scratchy" was,

374
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,725
without a doubt,
the worst episode ever.

375
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,435
Rest assured that I was
on the Internet within minutes

376
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,606
registering my disgust
throughout the world.

377
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,865
Hey, I know it wasn't great,
but what right do you have to complain?

378
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,949
As a loyal viewer,
I feel they owe me.

379
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,124
What?

380
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,623
They're giving you thousands of hours
of entertainment for free.

381
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:56,964
What could they possibly
owe you?

382
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,289
I mean, if anything,
you owe them.

383
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,665
Worst episode ever.

384
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,502
It looks like
the beginning of the end

385
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,797
for the venerable
"Itchy & Scratchy" program.

386
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:09,091
For years, TV critics such
as yours truly, Kent Brockman,

387
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,386
have waited impatiently
for cracks to appear

388
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,600
in the show's
hilarious facade.

389
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,981
Yesterday our prayers
were finally answered

390
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:20,978
when Poochie the Dog made
his howlingly unfunny debut.

391
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,573
Far be it for me
to gloat at another's downfall,

392
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,859
but I have a feeling

393
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,992
no children
are going to be crying

394
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,239
when this puppy
is put to sleep.

395
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,661
(laughing)

396
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,244
(bawling)

397
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,695
What the hell happened?

398
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,535
Well, I'd attribute
the product failure

399
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,870
to fundamental shifts
in our key demographic

400
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,206
coupled with the overall
crumminess of Poochie.

401
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,711
Whoa! You got to stop
this thing!

402
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,554
(bawling)

403
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,340
Please! I'm getting
egged on the street!

404
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,425
Do something!
Do something!

405
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,261
(sobbing)

406
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,716
(knocking)

407
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,846
Uh, hi, Mr. Myers.

408
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,393
I've been doing
some thinking

409
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,476
and I've got some ideas
to improve the show.

410
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,232
I got it right here.

411
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:06,693
Uh, one: Poochie needs
to be louder, angrier,

412
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,275
and have access
to a time machine.

413
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,991
Two: Whenever Poochie's
not on screen,

414
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,582
all the other characters
should be asking,

415
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,078
"Where's Poochie?"

416
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,700
-Three...
-Great, great.

417
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,656
Just leave them
right there on the floor

418
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,497
on your way out.

419
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,462
WRITER:
Thanks, Homer, great.

420
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,665
Hmm...

421
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,424
(muffled voices)

422
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,520
Listen, guys we got to do
something about Poochie.

423
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,640
KRUSTY: There's only one thing
we can do.

424
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,897
Then they said they were going
to kill Poochie off!

425
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,323
Really?
Oh, how terrible.

426
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,072
Yes. Terrible.

427
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,994
It's not your fault, Homer.

428
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,993
It's those lousy writers.

429
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,195
They make me madder
than a, um...

430
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,785
Yak in heat!

431
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,410
You're right, Marge.
It's not my fault.

432
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,708
I'm not gonna let them treat
Poochie like dirt anymore

433
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,632
just because
he's the new guy.

434
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,210
Right on, Mr. S.!

435
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,245
Put a sock in it, Roy.

436
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,129
Okay, so here's where
Itchy lunges at Poochie

437
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,718
with a rusty
chain saw.

438
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,603
Cue sound effects.

439
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,599
(chain saw buzzing)

440
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,720
Rustier!

441
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,727
(shrill buzzing)

442
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,479
Are you prepared to die,
Poochie?

443
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,401
No, I am not.

444
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,111
Oh, cut, cut, cut, cut!

445
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,612
Just stick to the script
as written, Homer.

446
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:36,124
You're supposed to say,
"Please, cut off my head.

447
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,318
I don't deserve to live."

448
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,867
Never!

449
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,124
(murmuring)

450
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,825
You can't just kill off
a classic TV character.

451
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,246
Poochie could be bigger
than curly fries

452
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,585
but first he has to
win back the audience.

453
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,841
That's why I'm going to read
these lines I wrote myself

454
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,133
with my own two hands.

455
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,676
Forget it, Homer!

456
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,259
We can do this show
without you if we have to.

457
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,965
But not without me.

458
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,015
Aw, jeez.

459
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,139
Let him try
the new lines.

460
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,347
All right.
All right.

461
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,227
We'll try it.
Action.

462
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,824
Hi, Poochie!

463
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,439
You look like you've
got something to say.

464
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,487
Do you?

465
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,200
Yes, I certainly do.

466
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,241
Hello there, Itchy.

467
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,994
I know there's
a lot of people

468
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,496
who don't like me
and wish I would go away,

469
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,459
but I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

470
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,330
I know I can come off
a little proactive

471
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,957
and for that, I'm sorry.

472
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:33,013
But if everyone could find
a place in their hearts

473
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,548
for the little dog
nobody wanted

474
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,182
I know we can
make them laugh

475
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,640
and cry... until we
grow old together.

476
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,682
And... cut.

477
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,661
Now kids, I know you loved
the old Poochie,

478
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,239
but the new one's
going to be better

479
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,865
than ten Super Bowls!

480
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,911
I don't want to oversell it.

I guess people just
weren't ready for Poochie.

I lost creative control
