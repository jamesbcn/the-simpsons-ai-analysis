Hey, Homie.

79
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,868
That's our cue.

80
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:26,457

then you're supposed to leave.

83
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,223
where the needle is on "E,"

84
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,548
but we still have a little more gas.

85
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,885
The brink of doom,
where I do my best work.

86
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,681
And I want to break out of our rut,

87
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,805
so I brought us a nice lunch.

88
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,352
Oh, honey,
you've given me a big appetite.

89
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,897

Sir, do you need help with that tea bag?

101
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,142
No, I can talk to Nigel by myself.

102
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,144
Nigel, you were wrong
about the Crimean War,

103
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,555
and you're wrong now.

104
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,443
Love can endure.

105
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,190
Oh, I could dissolve that union as easily

106
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,113
as the tea dissolves this sugar.

107
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,402
Smithers, did you see him
heft that sugar cube?

108
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,156
-Did I.
-Monty, I can break up that couple,

109
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,829
and I'd wager five million on it.

110
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,738
-Dollars or pounds?
-Pounds.

111
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,197
-Sterling or flesh?
-Sterling, this time.

112
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,708

120
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:08,269

it will not go down favorably.

124
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,194

If you knew anything about me,

153
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,515
you would know I would never,
ever shop in the produce section.

154

I got going for me.

175
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,826
Well, how would you like me to set you up

176
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,995

177
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,594
More elegant than this?

178
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,126
Aah!

179
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,592

the head talking, but sure.

185
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:57,978
"Sorry" and "Congratulations, Graduate."

186
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,350
They had a two-for-one sale.

187
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,267
-Now, I'm late because...
-Don't bother.

188
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,855
-But there's a really good...
-It's too late.

189
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,530
But you're...
you're gonna laugh when you...

190
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,609
No. I just have to accept that
you're never going to change.

191
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,155
No, no, don't give up.
I've changed before.

192
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,869

00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,859
and use it as an excuse to meet me?

270
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,278
Can I eat the cherry first?

271
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,656
Don't take too long.

272
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,702
I might-- I asked for extra cherries.

00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,076

They don't charge for extra cherries.

Well, I can't possibly lose. You're on.

00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,640
Mr. Burns, you can't use me
as a gambling chip.

Don't tell me, it's because I'm Jewish.

292
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,410
No, it's 'cause you're a has-been
nobody likes, all right?

293

so great in a strapless dress?

Well, thank you.

297
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,507
Methinks I see my opportunity.

298
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,434
Why are you telling me?

299
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,182
I always considered us friends.

300
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,846
So, let-- uh, what's your name there?

301
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,194
Brant-- Brant here pour something for you.

302
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,020
We got loads of microbrew
with crazy names,

303
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,646
like, uh, Hops-along Cassidy
and Michelob.

304
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,525
So, uh, where's Homer?

305
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,702

00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,460
Oh, you mean the drug.

312
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,753
No, the song.

314
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,341
"Moonglow," that's my favorite song.

315
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,006
Yeah, you came into my bar
seven years ago

316
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,755
and you played it on the jukebox.

317
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,097
I remember things like that.

318
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,943
So, you want to dance?

319
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,398
I actually do it a lot, but, uh,
nobody sees behind the bar.

320
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,111
I guess one dance couldn't hurt.

321
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,905
So, can you start Monday?

322
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,780
Oh, you won't break up the Simpsons.

323
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:50,617
I'm not used to getting my arms
all the way around someone.

324
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,504
Oh, God, I can't work for a man
I'm not in love with.

325
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,922
I've got to fix this now.

326
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,628
Simpson, you need to patch things up
with your wife now.

327
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,883
We're fine. Excuse me, bartender?

328
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,676
I ordered three dozen wings
and I only count 35.

329
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,140
Listen to me,

330
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,680
this was gonna be
a birthday present for my mother,

331
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,643
but I want you to give it to Marge.

332
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,273
Okay, what's the gag?

333
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,850
You have to reconcile with your wife.

334
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,856
Mm, there's always a catch.

335
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,018
I've seen a whole different side
of you tonight, Moe.

336
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,029
<i>MOE: Whoa, she's waving me home</i>

<i>But could I really do that to Homer?</i>

338
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,572
<i>Damn it, I need time to think here.</i>

339
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,697
Sorry, this is great, but I got to go

340
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,624
stick plastic ribbons onto toothpicks.

341
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,083
That don't just happen.

342
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,794
If Moe can change,

343
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,625
why can't my husband?

344
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,630
Well, um, seems to me the reason
your husband won't change

345
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,724
is 'cause he knows
he's got a great thing with you.

346
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,299
If he suddenly treated you different,

And why, if you were trying to be close,

359

would you spend the whole evening
away from me?

360
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,670
Hey, you've taken me off
the market since I was 18,

361
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,625
