is a Duff chick magnet.

125
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,020
There's got to be
some explanation.

126
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:32,774
The explanation is he's a jerk,
and I hope he loses.

127
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:36,305
(gasps) Lisa, you wash
your mouth out with beer.

Beer, please.

129
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:42,051

that he's not allowed to use

130

141
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:13,051
Oh, Duffman is busted. Oh, boy.

142
00:06:13,146 --> 00:06:15,546
You're a sexist and a phony.

00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,661
How can you live with yourself?

144
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:20,385
All right, all right,
I'm sorry I fibbed.

145
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:22,263
I panicked. I pulled up a pic

146
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:25,244
from Dufftoberfest
from a few years ago.

147
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:27,977
A few years ago
was the best one.

148
00:06:28,109 --> 00:06:29,379
What? Oh. (clears throat)

149
00:06:29,378 --> 00:06:32,178
Lisa's not your Lisa.
She's my Lisa,

150
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:33,594
so the next time
you're in trouble,

151
00:06:33,587 --> 00:06:36,257
use a picture
of some other guy's kid.

152
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:37,699
Thanks, Dad.

153
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,803
(crying)

154
00:06:41,803 --> 00:06:43,613
Sorry, I just...

155
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:47,522
Oh, no. (sobbing)

156
00:06:47,515 --> 00:06:49,745
Are you okay, Mr. Duffman?

157
00:06:49,853 --> 00:06:52,763
I am not. (sighs)

158
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:55,329
The thing is, I really do have
a daughter, okay?

159
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,130
Her name is Amber.
She's named after

160
00:06:57,267 --> 00:06:58,597
my favorite beverage color,

161
00:06:58,604 --> 00:07:01,114
but now she's 30 years old,
and she won't talk to me.

162
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,548
(sobbing)

163
00:07:02,545 --> 00:07:04,615
Lisa, do you mind waiting
in the car for a moment?

164
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:07,816
Daddy needs to be strong
for his famous friend.

165
00:07:07,822 --> 00:07:09,592
Of course.

166
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:13,368
Can I get a selfie of me
with you in your bathrobe?

167
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:17,006
Gah, your daughter is so bright
and confident.

168
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:18,307
She is.

169
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:21,019
So, you must've taught her
so much.

170
00:07:21,015 --> 00:07:22,745
I guess I did.

171
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:26,092
You must be the greatest
girl dad i-in the world.

172
00:07:26,092 --> 00:07:27,532
I must be!

173
00:07:27,528 --> 00:07:29,528
Maybe it's not too late
for me, huh?

174
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,542
Could you teach me
how to be a better...

175
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:33,236
you know, girl dad?

176
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:36,909
- I will!
- Duffman thanks you.

177
00:07:37,014 --> 00:07:39,054
And so do I. Come here.

178
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:40,391
(laughs)

179
00:07:40,387 --> 00:07:41,787
(phone camera clicks)

180
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,372
(news theme music plays)

181
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:51,209
(sighs, grumbles)

182
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,108
Come on, Duffman. Don't worry
about losing your job.

183
00:07:54,114 --> 00:07:56,654
We need to focus on how
you lost your daughter.

184
00:07:56,753 --> 00:07:59,123
That's why I've assembled
this crack team

185
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:00,704
of daughter dads
to help you out.

186
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:03,765
I think you'll find
they're the finest men around.

187
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:07,037
Welcome to P. F. Thong's.
You boys ready to order?

188
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,050
I will have the Lettuce D-Cups,
um, with a chicken side piece.

189
00:08:11,048 --> 00:08:15,488
I will have the Wedgie Salad
and the Baby Got Back Ribs.

190
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:18,301
Oh, and, uh, some Sprung Rolls
for the table.

191
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:20,766
I don't have much
of an appetite.

192
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,638
(chuckles) See, I, well,
I haven't talked to my daughter

193
00:08:22,638 --> 00:08:24,578
in years, and, um...

194
00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:27,046
Say no more. I'll bring you
a Dead Beet Salad

195
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,850
and a Coke Zero Contact.

196
00:08:29,953 --> 00:08:33,463
So, if your estranged daughter
writes an angry book about you,

197
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:36,329
don't self-publish
your rebuttal book.

198
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:37,972
(groans)

199
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:40,169
Uh, thanks for all
the advice, fellas.

200
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:41,483
Dad-vice.

201
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:43,275
(stammers) I-It's just,
I haven't talked to Amber

202
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,319
in over a decade. I-I don't
even know where to begin.

203
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,488
You just got to show her
you still care.

204
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,730
Pick up the damn phone.
Call her.

205
00:08:50,728 --> 00:08:53,798
GROUP:

206
00:08:55,638 --> 00:08:58,138
Call her! Call her! Call her!

207
00:08:58,142 --> 00:08:59,682
I'm on the phone with her now.

208
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,789
GROUP:
Ignore us. Ignore us. Ignore us.

209
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:04,785
Amber, I was just wondering, um,

210
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:07,659
could I maybe drive up there
to see you sometime?

211
00:09:07,762 --> 00:09:09,702
Uh, this weekend, maybe?

212
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:12,099
She said, "I guess."

213
00:09:12,104 --> 00:09:13,474
(others cheer)

214
00:09:13,473 --> 00:09:15,343
No, not... (cheers)

215
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:16,613
...because what if I screw up?

216
00:09:16,613 --> 00:09:17,953
What if Amber hates me? I...

217
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:19,949
I need you to come
with me, please.

218
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:22,993
A road trip with Duffman.
Woo-hoo!

219
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:25,032
You, me, and Lisa.

220
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:28,599
Bonet? This trip just keeps
getting better.

221
00:09:28,604 --> 00:09:29,914
No, no, no, your Lisa.

222
00:09:29,906 --> 00:09:31,476
I need both my girl-dad guru

223
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:34,146
and his dad-girl-daughter
for inspiration.

224
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:35,618
(both grunt excitedly)

225
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:38,618
Lisa! Lisa, you're coming
with me and Duffman

226
00:09:38,624 --> 00:09:40,534
on a road trip to Glendon Falls.

227
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:41,728
What? (yawns)

228
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,000
- Why would I want to do that?
- Hmm.

229
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:47,011
Marge, why would Lisa want to go
to Glendon Falls

230
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,337
with me and Duffman?

231
00:09:48,443 --> 00:09:49,783
(yawns, grunts)

232
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:52,589
Well, that's near
the Agatha Christie Museum

233
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:54,145
of Quirky Detectives.

234
00:09:54,154 --> 00:09:56,334
Lisa likes Agatha Christie?

235
00:09:56,325 --> 00:09:57,855
I love Agatha Christie,

236
00:09:57,862 --> 00:10:00,102
and that museum
is gonna be amazing.

237
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,109
(groans) Ooh! Ah, I can't
believe you remembered.

238
00:10:03,106 --> 00:10:05,846
They're having a special exhibit
this weekend

239
00:10:05,945 --> 00:10:08,545
on her ten reddest herrings.

240
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,620
Thank you.
You're the best dad ever.

241
00:10:11,723 --> 00:10:14,233
Aw, you don't have to thank me.

242
00:10:14,228 --> 00:10:17,168
Do it later in front of Duffman.

243
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:22,751
Man, I can't believe I'm on
a road trip with my hero.

244
00:10:22,745 --> 00:10:24,915
Wow, your little daughter's
your hero?

245
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:26,686
That's so sweet.

246
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:29,656
And that's exactly
who I was referring to.

247
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:32,359
Oh, hey, we should put on music
that Lisa likes, huh?

248
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:34,374
Okay, Lisa likes jazz.

249
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,568
That's a thing I know.

250
00:10:35,571 --> 00:10:38,041
Mm, I'm not in the mood
for jazz right now.

251
00:10:38,142 --> 00:10:40,212
Let's listen to
my second favorite.

252
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:42,383
Salsa? Old-school rap?

253
00:10:42,384 --> 00:10:43,654
Traffic on the twos?

254
00:10:43,754 --> 00:10:45,464
I like K-pop, Dad.

255
00:10:45,456 --> 00:10:48,056
Wh... Oh, uh, of course.
I knew that.

256
00:10:48,062 --> 00:10:51,402
(laughs) It's fun to pretend
that you're clueless.

257
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:53,412
(chuckles) Beautiful.

258
00:10:53,406 --> 00:10:56,246
♪ We are the lovesick girls ♪

259
00:10:56,345 --> 00:10:58,345
(singing along in Korean)

260
00:10:59,552 --> 00:11:00,592
Oh, yeah!

261
00:11:00,588 --> 00:11:04,088
♪ We are the lovesick girls. ♪

262
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,998
Dad, I don't need you
to do that.

263
00:11:09,137 --> 00:11:11,607
(laughs) They always try
to be older

264
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,280
than they are, don't they?

265
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:14,849
Oh, man, such good fathering.

266
00:11:14,849 --> 00:11:16,989
Not like... Duffman.

267
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:18,887
(sobbing)

268
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:21,261
Would it help to talk
about Amber?

269
00:11:21,262 --> 00:11:23,372
(sighs heavily)

270
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:26,641
She was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

271
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:28,783
<i>But then I became Duffman,</i>

272
00:11:28,777 --> 00:11:30,277
<i>and, well,
you know what they say,</i>

273
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,490
<i>"With great pilsner
comes great infidelity."</i>

274
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:36,386
<i>Her mom left me
when Amber was four.</i>

275
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:39,262
And by the end of high school,
Amber hated me.

276
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:41,444
Said she never wanted
to talk to me again,

277
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,740
and I guess I just believed her.

278
00:11:42,738 --> 00:11:44,878
Yes, believe women.

279
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:48,146
No, she was a kid.
She didn't mean it.

280
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,849
Yes, believe Lisa.

281
00:11:49,852 --> 00:11:51,892
I think about her every day,
and I...

282
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,290
I keep this drawing with me
wherever I go.

283
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:57,404
Aw, you need to tell her
all of this.

284
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,810
I bet she's been waiting for you
to reach out for years.

285
00:12:00,908 --> 00:12:03,448
Oh, Lisa, you are so sweet

286
00:12:03,547 --> 00:12:04,877
and so wise.

287
00:12:04,983 --> 00:12:07,353
Guh-reat job, Homer!

288
00:12:07,354 --> 00:12:08,924
Homer, Homer!

289
00:12:08,924 --> 00:12:10,734
<i>LISA:
Guess what.</i>

290
00:12:10,728 --> 00:12:12,898
They give you
a real tea set to drop

291
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,739
when you walk in the drawing
room and find a dead body.

292
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:17,238
(phone rings)

293
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,280
Brandon, what is up?

294
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:20,578
Seriously, like, uh, what's up?

295
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:22,281
<i>Not your election numbers,
Duff-bro.</i>

296
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:23,394
<i>They're dismal.</i>

297
00:12:23,386 --> 00:12:25,786
Look, you're near
the corporate mascot convention

298
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,861
at the Conventions.comventions

299
00:12:27,962 --> 00:12:29,102
convention center.

300
00:12:29,197 --> 00:12:31,367
It'd be a great chance
to drum up some support.

301
00:12:31,368 --> 00:12:33,138
<i>HOMER (over headset):
He'll do it, Brandon.</i>

302
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:35,639
<i>Duffman cannot lose
this election.</i>

303
00:12:35,644 --> 00:12:37,414
But what about the museum?

304
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:39,454
There's plenty of time for both.

305
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:41,921
That's a proud papa pledge.

306
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,350
Hey-ya, Chief,
can I count on you for a...

307
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:55,046
middle finger, okay.

308
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:58,019
Ooh, I bet this guy's
a registered Duffocrat.

309
00:12:58,122 --> 00:13:00,892
Uh-oh, he flashed a gun.
My goodness.

310
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:02,904
Anyone? Anyone want a selfie?

311
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:05,598
We could use my phone.
I can Air...

312
00:13:05,604 --> 00:13:07,014
Drop it to you.

313
00:13:07,007 --> 00:13:08,377
CONVENTION WORKER:
In five minutes,

314
00:13:08,376 --> 00:13:11,516
join us in Ballroom C
for a panel discussion.

315
00:13:11,516 --> 00:13:13,386
The Charlie Tuna Conundrum...

316
00:13:13,486 --> 00:13:15,886
When the Mascot Is the Product.

317
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,773
Attention, everyone,

318
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,910
Duffman is sitting
all by himself in Hallway B.

319
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:26,679
Please just go say hi to him.

320
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,980
He really needs this. And, uh,

321
00:13:28,984 --> 00:13:30,694
don't listen to this
if you're him.

322
00:13:30,788 --> 00:13:33,258
(laughs) Oh, my God.

323
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:35,629
Can I get your autograph...
pen?

324
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:38,504
I got to get a signature
from the Mucinex loogie.

325
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:41,243
He is so hot. (laughs)

326
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,720
Losing to a loogie.

327
00:13:44,816 --> 00:13:46,516
(sighs)

328
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,959
Dad, shouldn't we get going?

329
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:49,825
The museum closes at 5:00.

330
00:13:49,926 --> 00:13:52,626
Don't worry, sweetie,
I'm keeping an eye on the time.

331
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,171
It's only 2:30.

332
00:13:56,506 --> 00:13:58,276
(screams)
That's not a real clock!

333
00:13:58,275 --> 00:14:01,945
That's the mascot
for Tea Time Tamales. (gasps)

334
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:05,185
Oh, my God, no.

335
00:14:07,494 --> 00:14:09,804
LISA:
Wait! Wait!

336
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,502
No, don't close!

337
00:14:11,503 --> 00:14:13,043
You can't close yet.

338
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,739
Mm, sorry, kid, we're shutting
down for three months

339
00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:17,384
to build a new attraction.

340
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,180
LISA:
Aw, nuts.

341
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:22,064
You got to stay open.
We drove all this way,

342
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:24,487
and I'm a second grader
who solves murders

343
00:14:24,595 --> 00:14:25,895
on a sixth-grade level.

344
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,368
Well, look who I brought.

345
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,507
I can unlock a lot of things
for Duffman,

346
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:32,337
but not this museum.

347
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,090
(growls, screams)

348
00:14:40,093 --> 00:14:42,803
Well, this calls
for some expert dadding.

349
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,938
Lisa, honey,
tell Daddy what's wrong.

350
00:14:45,036 --> 00:14:46,666
This is all your fault.

351
00:14:46,673 --> 00:14:48,413
That's right.

352
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:50,679
- Let it out.
- Okay,

353
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,151
I am tired of you pretending

354
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,920
that you're some sort of
ideal dad when this whole trip

355
00:14:55,022 --> 00:14:58,402
you've been kissing
Duffman's cans.

356
00:14:58,496 --> 00:15:00,796
See, I knew you
wouldn't have any fun.

357
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,341
That's why I didn't think
you should come. Eh...

358
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:04,339
Uh-oh.

359
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:07,621
(gasps) You didn't even want
to bring me.

360
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,145
You were just using me

361
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:12,121
as some kind of girl-dad prop,

362
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:14,293
just like Duffman did.

363
00:15:14,294 --> 00:15:15,904
Don't ever

364
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,568
talk to me

365
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:19,068
again.

366
00:15:23,112 --> 00:15:25,622
She'll get over this, right?

367
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,557
Mine did not.

368
00:15:27,555 --> 00:15:30,255
Oh...

369
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:32,629
Ready, handsome?

370
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,571
- You're leaving?
- (grunts)

371
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:37,039
Duffman just realized that you

372
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,480
are not a good dad. Uh-uh.

373
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:43,751
I'm all yours... Renata.

374
00:15:43,753 --> 00:15:44,823
Fun name.

375
00:15:44,922 --> 00:15:46,432
(rolling R):
Renata.

376
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:49,228
Oh...

377
00:15:55,243 --> 00:15:56,653
So...

378
00:15:56,646 --> 00:15:58,346
what you reading there?

379
00:16:00,186 --> 00:16:02,256
Come on,
you got to say something.

380
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,890
Something.

381
00:16:03,894 --> 00:16:06,374
Ooh, I can't handle
the silent treatment.

382
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,165
Don't leave me alone
with my brain.

383
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:10,639
- I remember this one time...
- Eyes on the road!

384
00:16:10,741 --> 00:16:12,081
- (gasps)
- (tires screech)

385
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,050
Oh, Duffman left Amber's drawing
in the car.

386
00:16:17,053 --> 00:16:18,723
It's really a shame about them.

387
00:16:18,723 --> 00:16:21,333
It is. (sighs) He really does
love her, you know.

388
00:16:21,428 --> 00:16:24,298
Maybe, but Duffman should've
spent more time listening

389
00:16:24,301 --> 00:16:27,941
to Amber instead of thinking
only about himself.

390
00:16:27,942 --> 00:16:30,282
Well, maybe sometimes
Duffman's scared to listen

391
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:33,519
because he'll hear about all
the dumb stuff he screwed up.

392
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,920
Sure, but maybe
he should be brave enough

393
00:16:35,924 --> 00:16:37,934
to admit he's not perfect.

394
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:40,828
Not even close to perfect.

395
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:42,474
(groans) Oh...

396
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,610
I think we should
take this to them.

397
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:48,519
Yeah. I hope they work
things out before it's too late.

398
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:51,887
Me, too, Dad.
That would be really great.

399
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,290
(tires screech)

400
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,136
Good luck, buddy.
I'm rooting for you.

401
00:16:59,137 --> 00:17:01,137
Thank you, Evan, and good luck

402
00:17:01,141 --> 00:17:03,411
with your MFA. Oh, yeah.

403
00:17:09,324 --> 00:17:11,764
Okay, here we go.
Time to prove to your daughter

404
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:13,403
that you've changed.

405
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,369
Ah. Damn.

406
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,737
MAN:
A little help, bro?

407
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:17,907
Dude, it's Duffman.

408
00:17:17,908 --> 00:17:19,748
Join our rager!

409
00:17:19,745 --> 00:17:21,375
Oh, yeah.

410
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:24,091
I mean, no, no.
Not who I am anymore.

411
00:17:25,022 --> 00:17:26,732
(inhales, exhales)

412
00:17:26,726 --> 00:17:28,896
- (knock on door)
- Okay. (sighs)

413
00:17:28,997 --> 00:17:30,727
(breathes deeply)

414
00:17:30,734 --> 00:17:33,044
I can't believe you're here

415
00:17:33,138 --> 00:17:35,338
because I don't know you,
and I did not invite you.

416
00:17:35,343 --> 00:17:37,983
Oh, what an odd thing to say.

417
00:17:37,982 --> 00:17:40,292
Hi, I'm Homer, and this is Lisa.

418
00:17:40,386 --> 00:17:42,186
We have something
to give to your dad.

419
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,060
Yeah, well, I can't help you.

420
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,730
(sighs) He never showed.

421
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,271
(gasps) I don't get it.

422
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:50,539
If I know Duffman,
and I briefly did,

423
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,710
nothing was more important
to him than seeing you.

424
00:17:53,713 --> 00:17:54,883
He was so excited.

425
00:17:54,982 --> 00:17:58,522
Really? As excited as he was
to miss every dance recital,

426
00:17:58,523 --> 00:18:01,733
every graduation,
every art show?

427
00:18:01,729 --> 00:18:03,429
No. More.

428
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:05,342
Your dad taught me
the importance

429
00:18:05,336 --> 00:18:07,906
of not taking my daughter's
love for granted.

430
00:18:08,008 --> 00:18:09,708
Duffman's really changed.

431
00:18:09,712 --> 00:18:11,352
Trust me, when you see him next,

432
00:18:11,348 --> 00:18:13,818
you'll be amazed
at how enlightened

433
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,060
and sensitive he's become.

434
00:18:16,058 --> 00:18:18,328
DUFFMAN:
Chicken fight!

435
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:20,069
♪ Doo, bow, bow... ♪

436
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,836
Come on, friend!

437
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,170
- (laughs)
- What the crap?

438
00:18:24,174 --> 00:18:26,554
No, Amber, I was just about
to knock on your door.

439
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:27,616
You have to believe me.

440
00:18:27,615 --> 00:18:30,015
It's true.
This whole chicken fight,

441
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:31,759
it felt like
he was somewhere else.

442
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:34,926
I'm sorry, Colleen, but if this
teaches you anything,

443
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:38,099
it's that you should work on
your relationship with your dad.

444
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:40,672
(scoffs) I have a great
relationship with my dad.

445
00:18:40,674 --> 00:18:43,814
I just also like bikinis
and parties, you jerk.

446
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:45,453
Duffman respects your journey.

447
00:18:45,449 --> 00:18:47,519
Amber? Amber!

448
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,590
Amber!

449
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:52,004
Ah, Amber...

450
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,230
Hey, uh, pal...
Whoa, that's Duffman!

451
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,674
Amber, look out!

452
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:58,683
(gasps)

453
00:19:02,651 --> 00:19:04,661
You saved me...

454
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:06,355
Dad.

455
00:19:09,397 --> 00:19:12,167
So, the chick magnet
is also a daughter magnet,

456
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,510
I get it now.

457
00:19:13,506 --> 00:19:16,446
All chicks
are somebody's daughter.

458
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:19,376
- No. Uh-uh.
- Yeah, try again.

459
00:19:19,384 --> 00:19:21,864
Some chicks are guys,
and that's okay.

460
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:23,226
Mm... Mm-mm.

461
00:19:23,325 --> 00:19:25,155
- Hmm.
- It-It's okay, Dad.

462
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:27,396
B-Baby steps, I guess.

463
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,470
(loud whisper):
Give her this now.

464
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:33,481
No way. I haven't
seen this in ages.

465
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:35,379
I look at it every single day.

466
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:39,123
I miss you so much, and
I should've been there for you.

467
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:42,104
(scoffs) Dad, I'm so glad
you're back in my life,

468
00:19:42,096 --> 00:19:44,226
- and I really hope that...
- (phone rings)

469
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:45,944
Ugh, seriously?

470
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:47,878
<i>Duffman, amazing news.</i>

471
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,005
- You won the election.
- Oh, yeah?

472
00:19:50,012 --> 00:19:51,012
Oh, yeah.

473
00:19:51,014 --> 00:19:53,294
Some kid posted video
of you singing K-pop,

474
00:19:53,385 --> 00:19:56,015
and their fan army voted
for you en freakin' masse.

475
00:19:56,024 --> 00:19:57,564
I need you on
the next plane to Korea.

476
00:19:57,561 --> 00:20:00,631
Kim Jong-un wants to kidnap you
and make a movie together.

477
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:02,144
Oh, yeah!

478
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:03,936

479
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:07,149
Aw, you know what?
I think I have had enough

480
00:20:07,146 --> 00:20:08,676
of that wonderful Duff.

481
00:20:08,683 --> 00:20:11,663
What? You'll never work in
the adult beverage game again.

482

<i>No beer, no hard seltzer,
