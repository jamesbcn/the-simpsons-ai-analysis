1
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:28,891
Merry Christmas!

2
00:00:35,738 --> 00:00:37,576
Oh, stupid Flanders.

3
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:50,668
Oh, thanks for bringing me
up here, Dad.

4
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:52,271
It's magnificent.

5
00:00:52,338 --> 00:00:54,810
I could really use it
after what happened today.

6
00:00:54,876 --> 00:00:56,714
Aw, sweetie, are you still mad

7
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,951
about that big dumb jerk
at school?

8
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:00,521
She's my teacher.

9
00:01:00,588 --> 00:01:02,257
And her name is Miss Hoover.

10
00:01:02,324 --> 00:01:04,061
It's unforgivable what she did.

11
00:01:04,128 --> 00:01:05,497
What was it again?

12
00:01:09,806 --> 00:01:12,946
Breakfast!

13
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:14,983
Here you go.

14
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:17,522
Melon?!

15
00:01:17,589 --> 00:01:19,358
Marge, no one dreams
of waking up

16
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:21,362
to the sounds of frying melon.

17
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:23,166
- Yeah, Marge.
- See?

18
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:26,172
Your fruit breakfast has turned
him into a first name user.

19
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,511
For once, could this family
start the day

20
00:01:28,577 --> 00:01:31,349
with fruit instead of
greasy animal fat?

21
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:32,852
Even the dog is sweating grease.

22
00:01:37,394 --> 00:01:40,668
He'll be back for breakfast
and... Oh, God!

23
00:01:43,974 --> 00:01:45,110
We got her!

24
00:01:49,285 --> 00:01:52,357
I think I've got the answer.

25
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:54,529
Gravy up your fruit,
boy?

26
00:01:54,596 --> 00:01:56,533
Look at me. I'm eating healthy.

27
00:01:59,105 --> 00:02:00,440
You win.

28
00:02:00,508 --> 00:02:01,710
I'll make bacon.

29
00:02:01,777 --> 00:02:03,313
Put away the gravy boat.

30
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:06,152
They say the best days
of a gravy boat owner's life

31
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:09,158
are the day you get it
and the day you get rid of it.

32
00:02:11,563 --> 00:02:13,333
No, Bart, stop!

33
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:16,740
This is my mobile for my
"Who Inspires You?" project.

34
00:02:16,807 --> 00:02:20,413
Let me guess, it's gravity.
The ultimate suck‐up.

35
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,421
Can't spell gravity
without gravy.

36
00:02:24,488 --> 00:02:26,492
Have some more.

37
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:32,237
The subject I have chosen
for my mobile is this lady.

38
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:33,304
Ta‐da!

39
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:36,547
Of course. Yes. Her. Absolutely.

40
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:41,122
The woman who lives
at the center of the Earth.

41
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:43,193
It's Gladys West,
the mathematician

42
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:47,401
whose work in satellite geodesy
helped create GPS.

43
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:51,409
GPS. The invention that killed
the I got lost excuse.

44
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:54,215
Oh, gee, I'm sorry, Marge.

45
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:57,989
I just can't find the restaurant
for your sisters' birthday.

46
00:02:58,056 --> 00:03:01,262
Your destination is
60 feet ahead.

47
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:02,431
Shut up.

48
00:03:02,497 --> 00:03:03,868
40 feet ahead.

49
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,270
Shut up!

50
00:03:05,337 --> 00:03:06,840
20 feet ahead.

51
00:03:06,907 --> 00:03:09,278
Just what I need, another woman
who's always right.

52
00:03:09,345 --> 00:03:13,319
You have now arrived at
Lovely Ladies Cigar Lounge.

53
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:17,762
You'll be cutting and serving
the us‐shaped cake.

54
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:20,133
Who wants a thigh?

55
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,774
Curse you, Gladys West!

56
00:03:23,841 --> 00:03:25,477
Dad, please!

57
00:03:25,544 --> 00:03:28,149
This mobile could be
my ticket into Yale.

58
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:30,320
Another Bush kid.
Another Bush kid.

59
00:03:30,387 --> 00:03:32,457
How about this girl?

60
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:34,629
Her grades and test scores
are superb.

61
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:36,399
She's got boola.

62
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:39,004
But does she have "Boola Boola"?

63
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:42,010
What about this mobile
she did in the second grade?

64
00:03:42,077 --> 00:03:44,281
Accept. Full ride.

65
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:47,689
<i>Boola Boola, Boola Boola...</i>

66
00:03:47,755 --> 00:03:50,861
Ah, wha... how did I get here?

67
00:03:50,928 --> 00:03:53,199
They say it's dangerous
to wake up someone

68
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,203
who's dreaming of Yale.

69
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,376
Well, just so I'm covered,
let me dream of a safety school.

70
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:03,219
UMass Amherst.

71
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:08,630
Is Miss Hoover out sick?

72
00:04:08,697 --> 00:04:10,968
No, I'm in sick.

73
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:12,939
I sprained a disc in my back.

74
00:04:13,006 --> 00:04:14,642
It feels like I'm passing
a kidney stone

75
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:16,312
while giving birth.

76
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:18,817
I say excuse me
when I give burps.

77
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,153
Not the same, Ralph.

78
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,658
Fortunately, my new
Teaching With Stylus tablet

79
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:25,698
lets me run the classroom
from any position.

80
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,537
Let's get inspired.

81
00:04:28,604 --> 00:04:30,473
You might think
German chocolate cake

82
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,346
originated in Germany, but nein.

83
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:36,853
Actually, it was invented
by an American mill worker

84
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,158
named Samuel German.

85
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:43,700
I'm from America
but my measles are German.

86
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:46,973
I'm inspired by
The Masked Singer and...

87
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,913
It doesn't come off. Help!

88
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:54,756
Help! Help...!

89
00:04:56,626 --> 00:04:58,730
I know these presentations
are boring

90
00:04:58,797 --> 00:05:00,734
and everyone hates them, so...

91
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,037
- You're gonna stop?
- Better.

92
00:05:02,104 --> 00:05:03,607
I'm gonna rap.

93
00:05:12,558 --> 00:05:15,363
<i>Ah‐ha‐ha‐ha, Gladys West,
Gladys West</i>

94
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,990
<i>If you don't know
where you're goin'</i>

95
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:18,613
<i>She'll make sure your car
don't get a towin'</i>

96
00:05:18,637 --> 00:05:20,182
<i>Satellite telemetry,
should've been in ebony</i>

97
00:05:20,206 --> 00:05:21,786
<i>When it comes to geodesy,
she's got mad skills</i>

98
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,414
<i>- Like Yeezy
- We're giving props to</i>

99
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:25,851
<i>Gladys West</i>

100
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:27,855
<i>We're giving props</i>

101
00:05:27,922 --> 00:05:30,426
<i>'Cause she's the best</i>

102
00:05:30,493 --> 00:05:31,397
Lisa.

103
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,604
Lisa, you're over
your two‐minute limit.

104
00:05:38,109 --> 00:05:40,781
That's enough.
Ralph, you're up.

105
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:43,019
My hero is my thumb.

106
00:05:43,085 --> 00:05:46,125
It has its own room in
my mittens. Thank you.

107
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:47,695
Okay. That's it.

108
00:05:47,762 --> 00:05:50,166
Now put the supplements
to your reports on my desk.

109
00:05:55,544 --> 00:05:57,447
Give me a sec
to post the grades.

110
00:06:00,654 --> 00:06:03,025
A B‐minus? No, no.

111
00:06:03,092 --> 00:06:06,265
This can't be right.
This can't be right.

112
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,505
The same grade as Ralph?!
Sorry, Ralph, no offense.

113
00:06:09,572 --> 00:06:11,910
There's a fence around my bed

114
00:06:11,977 --> 00:06:15,016
so I don't steal things
from Daddy's squad car again.

115
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,955
Chief, did you tell Snake he
could have jail outside today?

116
00:06:18,022 --> 00:06:19,424
'Cause that's what he's saying.

117
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:20,794
Leave me alone.

118
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:22,898
Listen, Miss took too long
on her presentation,

119
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,470
it's not only right, it's easy

120
00:06:25,537 --> 00:06:28,476
with my Select All
B‐minus option.

121
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:31,482
Miss Hoover, this is so unfair.

122
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:34,622
I come here every day
eager to learn

123
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:37,662
and you just put me down

124
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:39,799
and complain about your job.

125
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,670
In the end, what are you?

126
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:43,907
You're just somebody
who works off a formula

127
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:46,011
that leaves no room for passion,

128
00:06:46,078 --> 00:06:48,149
individual effort,

129
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:50,486
or the process
of learning itself.

130
00:06:50,554 --> 00:06:51,923
In other words,

131
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,494
you're an uninspiring hack!

132
00:06:54,562 --> 00:06:57,635
Apologize immediately.

133
00:06:57,702 --> 00:07:00,507
No. I told the truth.

134
00:07:00,574 --> 00:07:03,412
The truth has no place
in this classroom.

135
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,751
Lisa, go to detention.

136
00:07:05,818 --> 00:07:08,289
Detention. Detention. Detention.

137
00:07:17,073 --> 00:07:20,079
One pencil with nervous
teeth marks.

138
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:23,820
One spelling bee
winner's ribbon, faded.

139
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:26,693
One quarter ounce of marijuana.

140
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,496
Those are pencil shavings.

141
00:07:28,563 --> 00:07:31,503
Willie's water pipe
will be the judge of that.

142
00:08:04,502 --> 00:08:06,438
Look at those arms.

143
00:08:06,506 --> 00:08:09,377
Blank canvas
for a Sharpie tattoo.

144
00:08:11,114 --> 00:08:13,385
I'm actually a vegetarian.

145
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:16,058
Okay, how do you feel
about beets?

146
00:08:16,124 --> 00:08:19,130
Ooh, is this one of those
questions that sets me up

147
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:20,233
to get punched?

148
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,203
Only one way to find out.

149
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,474
Yeah, tell us
your opinion of beets.

150
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:26,478
Leave her alone, you jackals.

151
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:31,321
This is the largest stink bomb
they make.

152
00:08:31,388 --> 00:08:33,827
So powerful it could only
be developed by a scientist

153
00:08:33,894 --> 00:08:35,931
without a nose.

154
00:08:35,998 --> 00:08:37,835
How did he know it worked?

155
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:40,339
He smelled it... with his ears.

156
00:08:42,811 --> 00:08:44,849
And that girl's with me.

157
00:08:46,753 --> 00:08:49,057
Well, well, well.
Together at last.

158
00:08:49,124 --> 00:08:50,961
I didn't do anything wrong.

159
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:54,067
Miss Hoover should be
in detention, not me.

160
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,904
There is a detention
for teachers.

161
00:08:55,971 --> 00:08:57,373
It's called being a teacher.

162
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,444
Now, let me show you my world.

163
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:01,248
Lots of gangs will recruit you.

164
00:09:01,315 --> 00:09:03,085
The Magnificent Seven‐Year‐Olds.

165
00:09:03,152 --> 00:09:06,024
Tardy Incorporated.
Hell's Angles.

166
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:14,207
My greatest weapon is inside
my head. My mucus.

167
00:09:14,274 --> 00:09:16,211
Ms. Timberwood!

168
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:18,282
In here, she doesn't know you.

169
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,252
She used to call me Sunshine.

170
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:22,123
I call all the girls Sunshine.

171
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,629
I call all the boys Joe Cool.

172
00:09:24,695 --> 00:09:27,233
Oh, you said I was
the only Joe Cool!

173
00:09:29,137 --> 00:09:32,645
That's actually lavender,
so, thank you.

174
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:34,180
Ay caramba!

175
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:37,153
No...!

176
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:43,967
No dinner for me.

177
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:46,004
I'm too miserable to eat again.

178
00:09:46,071 --> 00:09:48,242
This is pretty rough on me too.

179
00:09:54,555 --> 00:09:56,993
Please pull the covers off.

180
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,134
No, I don't want to live
in the world above the covers.

181
00:10:03,907 --> 00:10:07,013
I worked so hard on my mobile.

182
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,386
I know. And Miss Hoover
wasn't very nice.

183
00:10:10,453 --> 00:10:12,290
Thank you, Mom.

184
00:10:12,356 --> 00:10:14,127
But you weren't very nice,
either.

185
00:10:14,194 --> 00:10:15,229
What?!

186
00:10:15,296 --> 00:10:16,966
Hey, are we camping out here?

187
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,204
Because I have a great
campfire story.

188
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,477
About a man betrayed
by his own hand.

189
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:25,182
What the...?
Oh, oh, my God, it's you!

190
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:30,192
- Homer.
- Yes, Marge.

191
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:33,933
I was going to encourage
Lisa to apologize.

192
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,369
But I shouldn't have to.

193
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:37,841
Women say I'm sorry constantly

194
00:10:37,908 --> 00:10:40,045
because men make us feel like
we have to apologize

195
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:41,381
for existing

196
00:10:41,448 --> 00:10:43,787
while they do
whatever they like.

197
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:45,456
Yo. Milhouse is sleepin' over.

198
00:10:45,524 --> 00:10:47,226
Awesome.

199
00:10:51,803 --> 00:10:53,807
Ready to apologize, Lisa?

200
00:10:53,873 --> 00:10:55,811
We both know
what's at stake here.

201
00:10:59,217 --> 00:11:01,388
Not so fast, Lisa.

202
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:04,227
You didn't apologize
to your second grade teacher,

203
00:11:04,294 --> 00:11:07,099
and all we do at Yale
is apologize.

204
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,239
<i>Sorry, sorry, sorry</i>

205
00:11:10,306 --> 00:11:13,345
<i>Please excuse our quirks</i>

206
00:11:13,412 --> 00:11:15,382
<i>Quirks, quirks, quirks</i>

207
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:18,422
<i>Won't you kindly listen</i>

208
00:11:18,488 --> 00:11:22,096
<i>To us rich male jerks?</i>

209
00:11:22,163 --> 00:11:26,304
<i>We sing for free</i>

210
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:35,422
Okay, Lisa, your future is
in my hands.

211
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:38,563
I'm... not sorry!

212
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,466
I'm just glad
I won't have you next year

213
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,936
as a teacher.

214
00:11:42,003 --> 00:11:45,009
I might just move to third grade
to torment you.

215
00:11:45,075 --> 00:11:48,148
That would be a real hack move.

216
00:11:49,718 --> 00:11:51,689
Freshen it up.

217
00:11:53,058 --> 00:11:54,394
Love it.

218
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,542
Personally, I never say
I'm sorry.

219
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:04,080
I say I'm soggy.
Teachers hear what they want.

220
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:07,320
Bart Simpson, did you glue
these recorders together?

221
00:12:07,386 --> 00:12:08,488
Soggy.

222
00:12:08,556 --> 00:12:10,727
- Forgiven.
- And Willie can use it

223
00:12:10,794 --> 00:12:12,798
to whack the hornets' nests.

224
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:17,340
Yeah, come on and fight me
like a man.

225
00:12:19,077 --> 00:12:21,515
Which one of you does
the negotiating?

226
00:12:21,582 --> 00:12:23,185
Miss Hoover?

227
00:12:23,251 --> 00:12:25,122
In reference to our

228
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:27,995
recent difficulty,
I would just like to say

229
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:29,464
I'm soggy.

230
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:31,969
Did you just say I'm soggy?

231
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:34,708
In addition to a hack,
you must think I'm a fool.

232
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:36,979
Double detention.

233
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:40,319
<i>Who's soggy now?</i>

234
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:42,023
And that counts
as your music education

235
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:43,826
for the semester.

236
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:46,364
Feels kind of funny driving
you home from detention.

237
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,905
Yeah, well, it's gonna
take me a few minutes

238
00:12:49,972 --> 00:12:52,143
to get used to being
on the outside.

239
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:55,049
Honey, play the ad
I forwarded you.

240
00:12:55,115 --> 00:12:56,795
Having trouble with
a relationship?

241
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:59,190
Come to the Springfield
Education Annex.

242
00:12:59,257 --> 00:13:01,562
We'll teach you how to
communicate honestly,

243
00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:03,165
how to lie convincingly,

244
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:05,804
and how to apologize
and mostly mean it.

245
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,339
Apologize?

246
00:13:07,406 --> 00:13:08,976
Springfield Education Annex,

247
00:13:09,043 --> 00:13:11,314
located in the third abandoned
mall on Route One.

248
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:13,261
Don't park at the Greek church
across the street.

249
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:14,955
We're in a feud with them.

250
00:13:15,022 --> 00:13:17,794
There's nothing orthodox about
how fast they tow.

251
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:20,299
So, when apologizing
from your heart,

252
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:24,006
saying sorry allows
the healing process to begin.

253
00:13:24,073 --> 00:13:26,177
- Sorry I'm late.
- What?! She's sorry?

254
00:13:26,244 --> 00:13:28,215
Yeah, I've heard that one a lot.

255
00:13:28,281 --> 00:13:29,918
Well, I don't mind
saying I'm sorry

256
00:13:29,985 --> 00:13:31,354
when it's appropriate.

257
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:33,926
Appropriate.
Never heard of that word.

258
00:13:33,993 --> 00:13:36,030
I know inappropriate.

259
00:13:36,097 --> 00:13:37,901
- True. So true.
- Oh, yes, yes.

260
00:13:37,968 --> 00:13:40,940
Now, to truly apologize,
I find it helps

261
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:44,413
to look at the world from
the other person's perspective.

262
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,017
Now, repeat after me.

263
00:13:46,084 --> 00:13:48,355
I will not judge someone
until I walk a mile

264
00:13:48,421 --> 00:13:50,125
in their shoes.

265
00:13:50,192 --> 00:13:52,531
I will not judge someone until

266
00:13:52,597 --> 00:13:56,404
I walk a mile in their shoes.

267
00:13:56,471 --> 00:13:58,876
Well, what's the matter
with the rest of you?

268
00:13:58,943 --> 00:14:00,980
Walk a mile? Please.

269
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:02,951
Like, over how many years?

270
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:11,067
Miss Hoover takes the bus.
I didn't know that.

271
00:14:11,134 --> 00:14:13,004
Actually, she takes two buses.

272
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:15,209
Then she walks half a mile
down a train track,

273
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:17,179
swings across a drainage ditch

274
00:14:17,246 --> 00:14:20,185
and rides a piece of cardboard
down a hill to help her back.

275
00:14:20,252 --> 00:14:23,358
- Oh, that's terrible.
- I guess.

276
00:14:23,425 --> 00:14:26,865
You learn a lot of sad things
when you sell weed to teachers.

277
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,703
Make it a double.

278
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:30,640
I'll be in the ball shed.

279
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:45,837
- Excuse me, are you Jennifer Aniston?
- No.

280
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:49,811
That's exactly what
Jennifer Aniston would say.

281
00:15:03,773 --> 00:15:06,311
Dear Lord,

282
00:15:06,377 --> 00:15:08,148
please grant me this winner.

283
00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:11,822
I lost. And my quarter broke.

284
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,170
Yeah, I'm the super.
What are you doing here?

285
00:15:36,237 --> 00:15:38,108
I'm one of Miss Hoover's
students,

286
00:15:38,174 --> 00:15:40,546
and I just want to
understand her life.

287
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:41,849
All right, come on in.

288
00:15:41,915 --> 00:15:44,521
How can I say no
to a sweet face like yours, huh?

289
00:15:44,588 --> 00:15:48,128
Yeah, I have some business
in 12‐A.

290
00:15:48,194 --> 00:15:52,236
Yeah, how can I say no
to a sweet face like yours?

291
00:15:53,973 --> 00:15:55,910
Here, Hemsworth, come cuddle.

292
00:15:57,747 --> 00:15:59,851
I'm so alone.

293
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,089
Just don't eat me when I die.

294
00:16:04,393 --> 00:16:06,665
Is someone at the door?

295
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,502
I can't turn my head.

296
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:12,476
There's a great blues song
in here,

297
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:14,714
but I don't know what it is.

298
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:18,622
Don't you drag us
into your problems.

299
00:16:23,264 --> 00:16:25,469
Dad, I'm ready to say I'm sorry,

300
00:16:25,536 --> 00:16:27,172
but now it's not enough.

301
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:29,076
Lisa, you just gotta be sincere.

302
00:16:29,143 --> 00:16:31,380
If you have a disagreement
with another driver,

303
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:34,588
you simply say, I'm sorry.
Please go ahead.

304
00:16:34,654 --> 00:16:37,694
Then you follow 'em home
and you pee in their gas tank.

305
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,196
You pee in there!

306
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:41,334
Just can't say I'm sorry.

307
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,606
Does that remind you
of anyone, Carl?

308
00:16:43,672 --> 00:16:45,408
Oh, God, not this again.

309
00:16:45,475 --> 00:16:47,680
I have nothing to apologize for.

310
00:16:47,747 --> 00:16:50,352
You had 20 years
to watch The Sixth Sense.

311
00:16:50,418 --> 00:16:52,356
That's beyond
the spoiler window.

312
00:16:52,422 --> 00:16:54,694
Oh, so it's okay for me
to tell you

313
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:57,065
that the Lady Gaga Star
is Born is exactly the same

314
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:58,536
as all the other Star is Borns?

315
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:01,642
I'll kill you. I'll kill you!

316
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,378
Goodbye, college fund.

317
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,630
You were gonna pay
for my mini fridge.

318
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,505
I need to put a down payment
on something for someone

319
00:17:16,572 --> 00:17:18,842
I really owe an apology to.

320
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:21,748
A framed movie poster for
The Three Amigos?

321
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:23,686
It's better than you remember.

322
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,457
- No.
- All right, how about school supplies?

323
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:29,965
I got a Scottish guy who
sells 'em to me every week.

324
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,537
Hi, Willie.

325
00:17:32,604 --> 00:17:35,810
Yo no hablo English.

326
00:17:35,876 --> 00:17:37,580
Ach, the English.

327
00:17:37,647 --> 00:17:39,985
How I hate those wankers.

328
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,798
She's coming. She's coming.

329
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:51,642
Have a seat. Top of the line.

330
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,846
I can see your faces again.

331
00:17:53,912 --> 00:17:56,350
And now my favorite.
The ceiling.

332
00:17:56,417 --> 00:18:00,660
Miss Hoover, I'm sorry
I made your life harder,

333
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:03,632
and I hope this chair
makes it easier.

334
00:18:03,699 --> 00:18:06,437
Well, I don't accept
your apology.

335
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:08,441
- What?
- What am I supposed to do

336
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:10,211
after you called me a hack?

337
00:18:10,278 --> 00:18:12,550
In retrospect,
I might have been wrong.

338
00:18:12,617 --> 00:18:14,921
The sad truth is apologies
can come too late

339
00:18:14,988 --> 00:18:16,558
to do any good.

340
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:20,900
Congratulations, you just
learned something from my class.

341
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,469
I guess what you've learned is

342
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:24,908
teachers shouldn't get tenure.

343
00:18:24,974 --> 00:18:27,479
There has to be
a better lesson from this.

344
00:18:27,547 --> 00:18:28,982
There has to.

345
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:31,287
You've planted a seed, sweetie.

346
00:18:31,353 --> 00:18:33,992
- The seed will grow.
- Amen.

347
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:36,497
Why is everyone on the roof?

348
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:41,508
I know you're in there.
I'm old, but I'm not dead.

349
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:43,344
Or is it the other way around?

350
00:18:45,683 --> 00:18:47,820
What does this do?

351
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:50,325
Oh, that's a surprise.

352
00:18:50,391 --> 00:18:53,297
Really quite nice.

353
00:18:53,364 --> 00:18:54,901
Oh, yeah.

354
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,305
Miss Hoover, I've been thinking,

355
00:18:57,372 --> 00:18:59,911
and no offense,
but I bought you a chair.

356
00:18:59,978 --> 00:19:02,349
And that's really hard
for an eight‐year‐old.

357
00:19:02,415 --> 00:19:04,788
- All is forgiven.
- How forgiven?

358
00:19:04,854 --> 00:19:06,290
B‐plus.

359
00:19:06,357 --> 00:19:07,359
I'll take it.

360
00:19:07,425 --> 00:19:09,196
Can I get a B‐plus too?

361
00:19:09,263 --> 00:19:10,733
Sure.

362
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,473
- I'm soggy.
- Listen, boy.

363
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,812
I'm on to you. I know
you're saying soggy,

364
00:19:16,878 --> 00:19:17,947
not sorry.

365
00:19:18,014 --> 00:19:19,617
You're right, you're right.

366
00:19:19,684 --> 00:19:21,721
I completely apolo‐cheese.

367
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:23,625
- What?
- I beg your par‐ton.

368
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:26,230
- Come again?
- Guilty as Marged.

369
00:19:26,297 --> 00:19:28,535
I'll accept that.

370
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,706
- Soggy.
- Enough already.

371
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:37,219
<i>Lisa's at Yale</i>

372
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:40,491
<i>She'll never fail</i>

373
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,934
<i>She's got a huge
college debt</i>

374
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:47,740
<i>Debt, debt</i>

375
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:50,613
Please, I'm trying to study!

376
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:54,954
<i>Then go to Brown</i>

377
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:59,029
Can I have the book back?

378
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:01,768
It cost $200.

379
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:14,459
Now to dream of being
a World War I flying ace.
