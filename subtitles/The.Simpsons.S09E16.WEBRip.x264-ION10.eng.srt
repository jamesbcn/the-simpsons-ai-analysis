00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,511
(tires screeching)

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,389
D'oh! (screams)

5
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,184
(tires screeching)

6
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,348
(fire roaring)

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,230
-(sighing)
-(steam hissing)

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,240
{\an8}Oh, look.

9
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:39,536
{\an8}This is a perfect chance to get you kids
some nice church shoes.

10
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,172
{\an8}(both groaning)

11
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:44,459
{\an8}What do we need church shoes for?
Jesus wore sandals.

12
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,884
{\an8}Well, maybe if he had better arch support,
they wouldn't have caught him.

13
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,974
{\an8}(groans) Look, Homer!

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,840
{\an8}There's that bird you like to argue with.

15
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:55,096
{\an8}Well, well, well, if it isn't
Professor Know-it-all.

16
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,430
{\an8}Excuse me, Marge.

17
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:00,558
{\an8}They need a good, stiff,
all-purpose dress shoe.

18
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,853
{\an8}Something for church,

19
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,976
{\an8}but also for doctor's appointments,
dental checkups,

20
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,225
{\an8}piano recitals, building dedications,

21
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:11,487
{\an8}visiting elderly relatives,
haircuts and shoe shopping.

22
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,662
{\an8}Well, we have a brown shoe.

23
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,872
{\an8}Did you hear that, kids? Brown.

24
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:23,003
{\an8}Oh, rats. Talk about bad luck.

25
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:27,003
{\an8}I forgot to wear socks today.
Guess I can't try those on.

26
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,554
{\an8}Yeah, no problem.
You can wear the store sock.

27
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,045
{\an8}Ew.

28
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,103
{\an8}(grunts) Would you mind
lacing 'em up, kid?

29
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,389
{\an8}I have a bad back.

30
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,932
{\an8}Hey, if you didn't want to tie shoes,

31
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,725
{\an8}you shouldn't have become a shoe salesman.

32
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,444
{\an8}-(sighs)
-(bones cracking)

33
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,561
{\an8}That's where you're wrong, pal.

34
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,898
{\an8}It's not enough to want a cracker.

35
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,743
{\an8}You have to earn it.

36
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,913
{\an8}Mom, these are at least two sizes too big.

37
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,832
{\an8}Perfect, you'll grow into them.

38
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:00,791
{\an8}When?

39
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,710
{\an8}Oh, you're both way overdue for a spurt.

40
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,339
Excuse me, ma'am. Do you like to laugh?

41
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,669
(laughing) Oh, yes.

42
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,296
As long as it's tasteful.

43
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,425
And never at someone, or with, and not--

44
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:20,431
-Excuse me, sir. Do you like to laugh?
-Why, yes. Yes, I do.

45
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:24,725
Well, then you'll love our
comedy festival. It's for a good cause.

46
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,361
{\an8}-A rest home for pirates?
-No, Dad. It's to fight soil erosion.

47
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,529
Now, that's a fight I wanna be a part of.

48
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,783
Hey, somebody screwed up bad.

49
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,072
You've got all these big comics
lined up for your show,

50
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,486
but there's no Krusty.

51
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,164
{\an8}-Who?
-Krusty the Clown.

52
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,658
Funniest man alive, prince of pies,

53
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:47,496
-the sultan of seltzer?
-Excuse me, sir. Do you like to laugh?

54
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,844
Well, only if something
tickles me just right.

55
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,380
(laughing)

56
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,018
{\an8}Yeah, excuse me.
I'm looking for someone named

57
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,272
{\an8}"Jay Leno."

58
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,859
{\an8}-Somebody wanna get this kid a TV?
-Whoa, gee, thanks, mister.

59
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,820
{\an8}-Yeah, just joking. I-I'm Jay Leno.
-Oh.

60
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,452
{\an8}-So what can I do for you, huh?
-Well, if you're running the show,

61
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,489
{\an8}how could you leave out Krusty the Clown?

62
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,413
{\an8}Ah, Krusty the Clown? That takes me back.

63
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:26,293
-Didn't he die in a grease fire?
-No, he's alive.

64
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,672
And he is so funny, you could plotz.

65
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,080
At least according to his press release.

66
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:34,422
Well, if he's half as alive
as you say he is, he's in.

67
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,505
Uh, charity, eh? What's my cut?

68
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,057
Nothing? I make more than that
takin' a "schwitz."

69
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,556
Hey, hey, happy birthday! (chuckles)

70
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,647
Now get him out of here.

71
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,942
He seems reluctant.

72
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,065
Tell him it will count
towards his community service.

73
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,862
(grunting)

74
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,817
All right, I'll do it.

75
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:05,157
(groans) Boy, swipe one pair
of Haggar slacks,

76
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,405
and you're payin' for it
the rest of your life.

77
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:14,302
I finally got around
to reading the dictionary.

78
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,259
It turns out the zebra did it.

79
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,549
(laughing)

80
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,093
-I don't get it.
-Dad, the zebra didn't do it.

81
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,387
It's just a word
at the end of the dictionary.

82
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,761
I still don't get it.

83
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:29,477
-It's just a joke.
-Oh, I get it! I get jokes.

84
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,440
{\an8}(laughing)

85
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,821
Hey, hey, it's Krusty the Clown.

86
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,111
Hey, hey! Uh... (chuckles)

87
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,315
It's you, right?

88
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,695
And this guy, uh,
with all the jokes he does.

89
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,115
You're the reason I went into comedy.

90
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,504
If it weren't for you, I'd be a doctor.

91
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,825
Yeah, yeah, right. Thanks.

92
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,587
(sighs) I got my period today.

93
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,634
(coughs) Oh, good Lord.

94
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,925
Plus, I got this new boyfriend.

95
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,639
You know how it is when you're kissing
a guy with a tongue stud.

96
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,470
(laughing)

97
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:09,635
(laughing) Yes! Yeah! Oh, God, yes.

98
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,266
It's time for something special.

99
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,192
The man Spencer Tracy called

100
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,481
"the most promising newcomer of 1959."

101
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,356
Please put your hands together
for Krusty the Clown.

102
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:23,526
-(applause)
-Whoo-hoo! Yeah, Krusty!

103
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:27,164
Hey, hey. (goofy laugh)

104
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,083
So...

105
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,002
How about those TV dinners, huh?

106
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,246
I tried one the other day.

107
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,343
When lightning strikes,
the peach cobbler goes out.

108
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,499
(Bart laughing)

109
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,213
Cobbler.

110
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,678
The other thing about TV dinners,

111
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,009
you don't have leftovers, you have reruns.

112
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,678
(feedback on P.A. system)

113
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:53,016
TV dinner jokes? Ooh!

114
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,022
-Take that, Swansons.
-(chuckling)

115
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,185
Didn't like that one, huh? Well--

116
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,992
"Me so solly. Ah, so."

117
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,164
(groans) What's he gonna do next,
the flapping dickey?

118
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,530
(booing)

119
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,828
{\an8}Uh-oh, I'm losin' 'em.
Time for the "A" material.

120
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,213
Hey, hey!

121
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,545
"Ah, so. Ah, so.
Me-a like-a the flied lice.

122
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,087
Me flap-a dickey rong time."

123
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,694
(chuckles) Hey, Krusty, great set.

124
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,071
Are you kidding? I stunk up the joint.

125
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,398
No, no. I was talking to Lisa back there.

126
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,494
We both agreed. You killed.

127
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,949
{\an8}Really? Lisa, huh?

128
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,280
{\an8}Sure, there were a lot of laughs.

129
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,156
{\an8}You probably couldn't hear 'em.
The acoustics were so bad.

130
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,254
{\an8}Yeah, the acoustics. That's what it was.

131
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,119
{\an8}-I mean, "Me so solly."
-(both laughing)

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,250
{\an8}Yeah, I was great.

133
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,549
Did you get a load of "Corpsey" the Clown?

134
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,511
(scoffs) That guy
cheapens our whole profession.

135
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,682
-What do you think of him, Internet Comic?
-(beeping)

136
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,851
(laughing)

137
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,354
Guys, keep it down.

138
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,523
-Five minutes, Krusty.
-Oh, I ain't going back out there.

139
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,936
No, five minutes
to get your stuff and get out.

140
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,185
(groaning)

141
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,615
Where is that stinkin' monkey?

142
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,292
It's about time. Give me those reviews.

143
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,587
{\an8}"Last night's comedy benefit

144
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,669
{\an8}delivered wall-to-wall laughs
without exception."

145
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,255
{\an8}Phew.

146
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,340
{\an8}"The only exception was the embarrassingly
dated humor...

147
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,097
{\an8}of Springfield's
green-haired, red-nosed hack--"

148
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:56,017
{\an8}Yeah, yeah, yeah. "Krusty the Clown." No!

149
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,978
They say any publicity is good publicity.

150
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,272
You, sir, are an idiot.

151
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:06,186
-(chittering)
-Aw, that's your answer to everything!

152
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,532
(groaning) Look at my life.
I'm talking to a monkey and a--

153
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,829
I don't know what the hell you are.

154
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,909
You can be so cruel when you're sober.

155
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,334
Well, I'll fix that.

156
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:19,212
I'm goin' on the bender
to end all benders.

157
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,966
(gargling)

158
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,023
(slurping)

159
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,234
(gulping)

160
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,018
(sighs)

161
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,068
(music playing on TV)

162
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,620
(speaking Spanish)

163
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,619
(in English) What did he say, Lisa?
What did he say?

164
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,451
He said there's no shame
in their forbidden love.

165
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,168
Oh, Diego's not gonna like that.

166
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:06,916
(speaking Spanish)

167
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,256
(in English) "Take me here,
under the disco ball."

168
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,392
MARGE: Mmm.

169
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,721
Ah.

170
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,394
Beep, beep. Clear the couch.
It's Krusty time.

171
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:20,853
ANNOUNCER: <i>And now, here's Krusty.</i>

172
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,185
(cheering)

173
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,780
<i>Hey, hey. I'm Kent Brockman the clown,</i>

174
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:32,359
<i>filling in for Krusty the Clown</i>
<i>who didn't come in today.</i>

175
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,566
<i>He is presumed dead or on vacation.</i>

176
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,277
<i>Today's top joke.</i>

177
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:41,407
<i>It seems a local moron</i>
<i>threw his clock out the window.</i>

178
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,126
<i>We'll tell you why right after this.</i>

179
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,794
{\an8}Oh, this sucks. I am out of here.

180
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,916
(Krusty groaning)

181
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:58,348
Wow, a clown. Do you think he's evil?

182
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,431
(sniffing) He smells evil.

183
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,016
(sniffing) Should we tell Daddy?

184
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,272
No, let's poke him a little while longer.

185
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,274
Hey, get away from him, you little freaks.

186
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,936
(screaming)

187
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,030
-(groaning)
-(Bart groaning)

188
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,618
-(grunting)
-Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

189
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,487
(groans)

190
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,367
Oh, it hurts to talk.

191
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,002
We'll have to work out a system of blinks.

192
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,787
Not you, you imbecile.

193
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,207
{\an8}Oh, pew, what were you drinking, gasoline?

194
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:35,337
Yes, I was drinking gasoline, Mother.

195
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,970
Blah!

196
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,814
-Uh, Krusty.
-Hang on, kid. I got a tack in my head.

197
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,355
That's one of your posters.
I got all the Krusty stuff.

198
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,240
Man, look at all the crap
with my face on it.

199
00:10:56,364 --> 00:11:00,034
{\an8}"Krusty's Personal Swabs"?
What was I thinking?

200
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,834
All these years, I should've
been working on my act,

201
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,912
but I was too busy selling out.

202
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,384
Now I'm just a tired old hack.

203
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,879
(sobbing)

204
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:16,974
Ah, that burns! What the hell
is on those things?

205
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,971
{\an8}-Here. Quick, use my Krusty Eye Wash.
-No, not on your life.

206
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,101
BART: Thanks for coming, Jay.
Krusty really needs help.

207
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,142
Oh, no question.

208
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,886
I gotta freshen up my act.

209
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:31,227
Jay, you're a professional
comedian, right? Right?

210
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,315
-Answer me!
-Yes! Now stop squirming.

211
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,742
I'm trying to get these tangles out.

212
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,073
Oh, they are just impossible.

213
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,330
{\an8}Well, they are. Anyway, don't you have
some advice for Krusty?

214
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,831
Well, these days, people like
observational humor,

215
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,294
about things they deal with
in everyday life.

216
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,745
{\an8}Oh, yeah. You mean like when
your lazy butler washes your sock garters

217
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,707
{\an8}and they're still covered with schmutz?

218
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,427
Well, kind of, but more universal.

219
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,549
And maybe lose the "Me so solly" bit.

220
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,176
{\an8}Hey, whoa, whoa. Let's not tamper
with the classic.

221
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:07,064
{\an8}Shut up, kid. Come on, Leno.
Tamper, teach, impart.

222
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,845
(whistling)

223
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,227
-Dad!
-Whoops! Sorry, Son.

224
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,484
I didn't know you, Jay Leno and a monkey
were bathing a clown.

225
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,158
Well, they are, so make
with the loofah or get out.

226
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,028
-(applause)
-And then of course, there's Mom,

227
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,446
who sounds something like this.

228
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,541
(clears throat)

229
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,249
"Eat your vegetables. Take a sweater.

230
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,093
I don't think that's a good idea. Hmm."

231
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,960
-(laughing)
-(Laughing) Take that, Marge.

232
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,552
-(grunts)
-Thank you, thank you.

233
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:44,764
And now, the all-new comedy stylings of...

234
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:48,477
Krusty the Clown!

235
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,733
(cheers) Oh, Krusty!

236
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:55,112
Wait. Where's my water?
Oh, there it is. All right.

237
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,111
Hello.

238
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,744
I'm a real person. And as a real person,

239
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:02,069
I've made some humorous observations
about real life.

240
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:06,156
For example, have you ever noticed
how there are two phone books,

241
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,794
a white one and a yellow one?

242
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,921
(chuckles) Like,
what's the deal with that?

243
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,458
One's residential, the other is business.

244
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,213
Oh, well, that makes sense.

245
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,303
What will they think of next, blue pages?

246
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,302
They have those.
They're government listings.

247
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,465
I see.

248
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,886
Uh, what about two-cent stamps?

249
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,185
Pizza pie is very hot these days.

250
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:36,359
Can't open pickle jars. No mail on Sunday.
Out of paper towels.

251
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,480
Oh, oh, oh.

252
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,153
-What's the deal with cardboard?
-Boo!

253
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,357
All right, let's just
move on to Notebook 2.

254
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,657
-I've really gotta get dinner started.
-Me too.

255
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,911
I also have to go. Boo!

256
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,293
(groans)

257
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,043
{\an8}Krusty, the acoustics in here--

258
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,411
I appreciate the effort, kid.

259
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,668
But there's only one thing
left for me to do.

260
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,632
(chattering)

261
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,212
Thank you for coming.

262
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,838
(clears throat)

263
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,894
"Smart lads who slip at times away.

264
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,509
From fields where glory will not stay.

265
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,388
Runners whom the race outran

266
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,524
and the name died before the man."

267
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,941
Krusty, does this have a point?

268
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,941
Yes. I'm quitting show business.

269
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:21,242
I was just trying to go out
with a little class, you jackass.

270
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,448
But, Krusty, why now?
Why not 20 years ago?

271
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,870
'Cause comedy ain't funny anymore.

272
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,999
Instead of time-tested jokes
about women drivers and doctor bills,

273
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,328
you got some big-chin schlub

274
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,754
reading typos from the <i>Palookaville Post.</i>

275
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,844
Well, here's a headline
for you. Nobody cares.

276
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,630
(laughing)

277
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,965
Hey, I washed your hair.

278
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,010
These comics today.

279
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,564
"Ooh, look at me. I can't set my VCR.

280
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,718
I can't open a bag of airline peanuts.

281
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,477
I'm a freakin' moron."

282
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,729
(laughing)

283
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,521
(laughing) Krusty's gone nuts.

284
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,936
Then you got these lady comics
talking about stuff

285
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,276
that would embarrass Redd Foxx.

286
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,991
God rest his smutty soul.

287
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,493
Who they slept with.
What time they sit on the can?

288
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,075
-This is supposed to get you a husband?
-(laughing)

289
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,832
What the hell are you laughin' at?
I'm just tellin' the truth.

290
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,665
-(laughing) And it's funny.
-It is?

291
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,170
In that case, I'm proud to announce
my triumphant return to comedy.

292
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,585
(cheering)

293
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,643
-"Four drink minimum"?
-I'll cover you, honey.

294
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:39,186
Hi, how you folks doing? I'm Moe.

295
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,521
Or, as the ladies like to call me,

296
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,357
"Hey, you, behind the bushes."

297
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,738
-Is this thing on?
-No. Sorry, Moe.

298
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,870
(feedback on P.A. system)

299
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,490
And now, without further Apu.

300
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,207
I have been zinged and I love it.

301
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,208
The last angry clown,

302
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,500
the man who spews truth
from every orifice,

303
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,335
ladies and gentlemen, Krusty.

304
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,339
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

305
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,928
So I'm watchin' TV today--

306
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,984
Whoo! TV, yeah!

307
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:20,478
All I keep seein' is dead celebrities
hawkin' products.

308
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:24,072
The got poor Vincent Price floatin' around
on a toilet cake

309
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,859
tellin' me about "the horrors
of an 'unfresh' bowl."

310
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,815
(laughing)

311
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:33,325
And I tell you somethin' else,
I do not believe Winston Churchill

312
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,329
would eat at Der Wienerschnitzel.

313
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,081
(laughing)

314
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,464
There's nothin' those
Madison Avenue grave robbers won't do

315
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,343
-to get us to buy their crap.
-(cheering)

316
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,799
Impeach Churchill!

317
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,721
Well, here's one dollar

318
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,090
those crooks aren't
gonna get their hands on.

319
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,845
-(gasping)
-Uh, isn't that illegal?

320
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,691
I don't care if it is illegal.
I'm makin' a stand here. Who's with me?

321
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,188
I am! I worked like a dog for this.

322
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,818
-(man 1) Yeah!
-(man 2) Me too.

323
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:09,109
Oh, you're burning it all wrong, Seymour.

324
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,284
{\an8}It's my allowance, Mother,
and I'll burn it the way I want.

325
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,243
Take that, you greedy fat cats.

326
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,285
-Marge, give me your purse.
-Here's $42. That's everything I have.

327
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,960
-Run home and bury it in the yard.
-I love you, Mom.

328
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,580
(cheering, clamoring)

329
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,133
Wow, they're hanging on his every word.

330
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,335
-Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
-I hope so.

331
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,098
I thought I made myself clear in Boston.

332
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,886
(chuckling) From now on

333
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,516
I'm gonna be just like Krusty
and tell it like it is.

334
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,114
Marge, you're getting a little fat
around the old thighs.

335
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,690
-Dad!
-You too, Bart.

336
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,395
Oh, knock it off, Homer.
You're the fattest one in the car.

337
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,777
{\an8}You didn't have to
tell it like it is, Marge.

338
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,409
I'm proud of you, Krusty. Oh, sure,
I've got material success,

339
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,878
my own show, acres of cars,
a nice microwave oven.

340
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,591
But you're out there on the edge.

341
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,799
You're doin' it for the sheer thrill.

342
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,842
And if I wasn't so afraid of clowns,
I'd give you a big hug.

343
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,136
Hey, excuse me, Krusty.
We've been watching you at Moe's all week.

344
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,681
And your credibility is just wow.

345
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,305
Get to the point, Armani.

346
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,981
Well, we think you'd be
the perfect spokesman

347
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,020
for our company's
new sports utility vehicle, the Canyonero.

348
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,565
I guess you Wall Street weasels
didn't get the word.

349
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,189
Krusty's not for sale.

350
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,065
But you endorse everything. In fact,
this endorsement contract

351
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,953
comes from your line of legal forms.

352
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,870
It's a quality form.

353
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,449
But those days are behind me.

354
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,244
I don't shill for nobody no more.

355
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,787
Are you sure? 'Cause we're prepared
to offer you

356
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,462
a free, fully-loaded Canyonero.

357
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,803
(stuttering) Oh, well.

358
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,626
No! Take your corporate blood wagon
and get the hell out.

359
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,337
Are you sure? It's free.

360
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,682
Stop saying that!

361
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,520
(cheering)

362
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,522
I brought a bag of money
in case he wants us to burn it again.

363
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,274
I hope he tells us to burn our pants.

364
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,976
These things are driving me nuts.

365
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:14,526
So this afternoon, two suits come up to me

366
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:18,071
and ask me to endorse some new
sports utility vehicle.

367
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,367
-What did you do?
-(gasping)

368
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,990
Don't you hate pants?

369
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,827
I threw those two creeps out
on their ass.

370
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,423
(cheering)

371
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,375
Then they followed me home,

372
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,840
beggin' me to take a test drive.

373
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:36,181
And let me tell you, talk about roomy.

374
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:41,138
The Canyonero combines the smooth handling
of a European sports car

375
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,771
with the rugged drivability
of a sturdy 4x4.

376
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,729
-(murmuring)
-Hey, Krusty, what are you talking about?

377
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,900
I thought you said those guys were creeps.

378
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,649
Yeah, but that was
before I got to know 'em.

379
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:56,862
And I'm tellin' you, the Canyonero
is the Cadillac of automobiles.

380
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,445
That's Canyonero.

381
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,872
(clamoring)

382
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,503
Wait! Where you going?
I still got plenty of beefs.

383
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,420
Fat-free yogurt. The--The quality
of computer porn.

384
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,040
(groans)

385
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,170
I knew I should've gone on first.

386
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:19,217
I don't get it, Krusty.
You said you would never be a shill again.

387
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,851
Eh. I learned something
about myself tonight, kid.

388
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:27,312
It ain't comedy that's in my blood.
It's selling out.

389
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,771
Come on, I'll give you a ride home.

390
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,647
Wow. This is roomy.

391
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,153

392
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,566
