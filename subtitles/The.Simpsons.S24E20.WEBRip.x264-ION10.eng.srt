1
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:12,298
(exclaiming)

2
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,561
(school bell ringing)

3
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:22,312
(Barney belches)

4
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:27,322
(playing the blues)

5
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,624
(tires screeching)

6
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:34,985
D'oh!

7
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,486
(tires screeching)

8
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,618
(grunts)

9
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,794
(Homer moaning)

10
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,379
What the...! (screams)

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,960
Hmm? (sniffs)

12
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,627
Ew, cheap PVC smell.

13
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,926
Oh, no. I'm an action figure!

14
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,680
And I hate action.

15
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,512
Hiddiley-ho, articulated neighborino.

16
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,927
Beautiful day, isn't it?

17
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,515
Why, it's practically mint on card.

18
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,021
Shut up, Flanders!

19
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,102
(screams)

20
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,784
(laughs) This reality ain't all bad.

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,030
(blows)

22
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,911
Pastry power, activate.

23
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,158
(laughs)

24
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,659
(groans)

25
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,661
-Whoa!
-(whimpers)

26
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,703
Beep, beep, beep.

27
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,035
(belching)

28
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,245
Homer, give me a yank.

29
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,457
I'm lonely. Typical.

30
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,547
Homer, this isn't the way to the mall.

31
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,303
The mall?
I thought you said Badass City!

32
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,385
(kids screaming)

33
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,770
(horn honks)

34
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,268
Tokyo drift.

35
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,980
(engine revs, tires squeal)

36
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,188
(laughs) I'm a fatality.

37
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,606
-(whoops)
-All right, Dad!

38
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,157
(tires screeching)

39
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,991
(grunting)

40
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,866
(sinister music plays)

41
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,713
HOMER:
Hey, put the chicken one back on.

42
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,386
{\an8}Urgent message from Nelson Muntz.

43
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,548
{\an8}Go on.

44
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,796
{\an8}Haw. Haw.

45
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,005
{\an8}(groans)

46
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,349
{\an8}Well, I am going to write
a note back to Mr. Muntz.

47
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,976
{\an8}Sorry about that.

48
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,646
{\an8}So, Mrs. Simpson,
the reason you're here...

49
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,824
{\an8}Let me guess.
You need a field trip mom.

50
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,664
{\an8}A library volunteer?

51
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,159
{\an8}Someone to Purell the CPR dummy?

52
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,042
{\an8}Resusci-Kate is just fine, thank you.

53
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,370
{\an8}We're here to talk about Bart.

54
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,746
{\an8}(sighs) What did he do now?

55
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,044
{\an8}Oh, today, I'm not here to talk
about what he did.

56
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,378
{\an8}I'm here to talk about the future.

57
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,092
{\an8}(sighs)
What did he do in the future?

58
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,974
{\an8}I'm not sure what he's planning,

59
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,970
{\an8}although there is a lot
of Internet chatter.

60
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,602
{\an8}I want to change his character:

61
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,179
{\an8}less Dennis the Menace,
more Casper the Ghost,

62
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,595
{\an8}if he were still alive.

63
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,943
{\an8}What if Bart took music lessons?

64
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,109
{\an8}Music classes could channel
his destructive impulses

65
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,109
{\an8}into artistic expression.

66
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,611
{\an8}I myself have been taking
flamenco lessons.

67
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,317
{\an8}(strums)

68
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,574
{\an8}(plays flamenco music)

69
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,076
{\an8}Got it, music lessons.

70
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,289
{\an8}(grunts)

71
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,539
{\an8}(playing)

72
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,297
{\an8}SKINNER: Mother!

73
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:38,383
{\an8}Right. Right. Inside.

74
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,931
{\an8}Oh, stupid clog.

75
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,188
{\an8}(gasps) My head hairs!

76
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,229
{\an8}I'm bald!

77
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,443
{\an8}Get... get in there.

78
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,863
{\an8}(whoops)

79
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,276
{\an8}D'oh!

80
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,738
{\an8}(grunts)

81
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,032
{\an8}Aw, damn it!

82
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,655
{\an8}<i>-MAN (over TV): Welcome back...</i>
<i>-(audience applauds)</i>

83
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,203
{\an8}to <i>America's Most Tattooed Baby.</i>

84
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,667
{\an8}Now, if the Lindblads can fit
just one more tattoo

85
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,878
{\an8}on baby Jennifer--
and she's getting pretty full,

86
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,089
{\an8}I can tell you that--

87
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:15,258
{\an8}they win the grand prize of $100.

88
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,378
{\an8}So what'll it be?

89
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,594
{\an8}Walk away! Walk away!

90
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,675
{\an8}TV's gotten so lousy.

91
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,350
{\an8}Did you ever wonder if hippopotamuses

92
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,219
{\an8}think that rhinos are unicorns?

93
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,136
{\an8}TV's not so bad.

94
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,234
{\an8}Sweetie...

95
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,771
{\an8}did you ever think of doing something

96
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,614
{\an8}a little more creative with your time?

97
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,230
{\an8}If you're worried about your
Mother's Day present, it's in the works.

98
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,527
{\an8}I was thinking something more artistic.

99
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,196
Something musical.

100
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,695
You could take advantage

101
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:50,116
of a fantastic musician living right here.

102
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,036
(playing the blues)

103
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,168
That's the kind of riff you can aim for

104
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,216
after years of practice.

105
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,720
We start off with the fun stuff:
music theory.

106
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,302
(giggles)

107
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,307
Don't worry, music theory's

108
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,639
just a fancy word
for music math. (chuckles)

109
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,146
My dear boy, you undoubtedly think
of the slide whistle

110
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,899
as merely a whistle that slides.

111
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,072
Let me disabuse you
of that misperception.

112
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,202
(playing complex classical tune)

113
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,123
Pass.

114
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,119
Do you have any idea how difficult...

115
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,081
-Bye, now.
-(whistle sliding down)

116
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,912
(playing complex classical tune)

117
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,208
COMIC BOOK GUY: Behold!

118
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,961
From the pages
of <i>Dune </i>and <i>Dune Messiah,</i>

119
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,174
Gurney Halleck's beloved zither:
the baliset.

120
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,795
(plays twanging, alien music)

121
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,013
Pass.

122
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,842
(clears throat) When I die,

123
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:48,307
you will carry on the tradition
of... the Frink-e-min.

124
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,389
(plays electronic tones
that sound like Frink's voice)

125
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,729
-Pass.
-(dog howling)

126
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,573
Ah, Mr. Homer.

127
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,438
I see you are wearing
the bald man's beret.

128
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,856
Is it that obvious?

129
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,454
Oh, yes. The only thing that screams

130
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,410
"I am hiding hairlessness" more
is a goatee.

131
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,912
I'm as smooth as jazz.

132
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,995
(scatting)

133
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,495
Oh... my wife has never seen
my head naked.

134
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,415
Maybe I should wear a cowboy hat.

135
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:23,014
A cowboy hat means
"I'm ashamed of my small penis."

136
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,471
Don't even ask me what this means!

137
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,471
-(gunshots)
-Yee-haw!

138
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,523
-I'm a-compensatin'!
-(gunshots)

139
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,928
(beautiful piano music playing)

140
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,364
(buzzer sounds)

141
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,479
(Russian accent)
New student. Sit at piano.

142
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,896
My daughter teach you.
You, mother!

143
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,485
Come to kitchen and see
picture of my dead wife.

144
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,161
That's okay. I...

145
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,830
(laughs) No, no, no, no.

146
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,908
She is not dead in picture.

147
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,703
Uh... she is dying.

148
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,747
Let's go, Bart.

149
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,041
(piano playing continues)

150
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,392
(Russian accent) So, you want lesson?

151
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,219
Yes. I want lesson.

152
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,854
I accept your whip.

153
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,181
<i>BART: A girl who likes candy?</i>

154
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,098
<i>Wow.</i>

155
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,686
(playing beautifully)

156
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,912
So, how much are lessons?

157
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,739
I give you something you want...

158
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,414
(voice deepens)
you give me something I want.

159
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,456
I'm sorry, did my voice go all evil?

160
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,668
(chuckles) It is common
with Russian accent.

161
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,208
You'd better be asking
for something PC:

162
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,753
pie or cake.

163
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,256
Here's my offer:
my daughter give lessons,

164
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,758
you teach me to drive car.

165
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,970
There might be some nagging involved.

166
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,600
Deal! Now we toast with vodka.

167
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,008
(glass shatters)

168
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,676
(gulps) Ah.

169
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,184
-(grunts)
-(glass shatters)

170
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,476
-Now we drive!
-Huh?

171
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,435
Homer, I recommend getting drunk

172
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,402
on my most expensive beer:

173
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,443
Duff Platinum.

174
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,066
Hey, what the...?
But I used the best label paste.

175
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:14,486
Those two hairs were what
was left of my youth, Moe.

176
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,617
Hey, come on,
there's sexy bald, like, um...

177
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,536
Babar, king of the elephants.

178
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,625
I read his books as a kid.

179
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,460
He married his cousin, Celeste.

180
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,755
That was my takeaway.

181
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,258
Those royal elephants have
trainers to keep them in shape.

182
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,592
Average schmoe like me, forget it.

183
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,057
Well, let me see how bald you are.

184
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,888
Whoa... whoa! Dear Lord.

185
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,194
Here. Oh.
You need this more than I do.

186
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,978
(grunts)

187
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,646
(whimpers)

188
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,192
Just... just what exactly
is this good for?

189
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,491
(groaning)

190
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,121
It's nice when something
you plan in your head

191
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,369
for so long comes to fruition.

192
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,447
Where you going, Bart?

193
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,038
-Piano lesson.
-Ooh, piano lesson.

194
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,754
We put two of those guys up there

195
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,674
just for using a big word.

196
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,593
"Caché" is not a big word.

197
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,382
-Clickety clack!
-(yelling, groaning)

198
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,887
Wait, wait.

199
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,509
I'm not learning anything.

200
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,805
I'm just going
'cause the teacher's pretty.

201
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,808
Okay. But you'd better steal bananas
for all of us.

202
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,061
I will!

203
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,692
Let me go.

204
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,309
I have a swim lesson
with a gorgeous lifeguard.

205
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,727
-What gender?
-You're not allowed to ask.

206
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,686
Okay. Check your mirrors.

207
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,703
Hands at 10:00 and 2:00.

208
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,741
Slowly back out of the driveway.

209
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,075
-(tires squeal, metal crunches)
-Aah!

210
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,002
Mmm...

211
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,582
Daddy said I was a accident.

212
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,498
Okay, let's try again.

213
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,665
(engine revs, tires squeal)

214
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,967
(playing scales)

215
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,221
That is so beautiful. Did you write it?

216
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,184
These are scales.

217
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:02,694
Now, memorize:
Every good Boris deserves farm.

218
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:07,188
Let me try.
Every good booger deserves flicking.

219
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,113
Your tongue is nimble,

220
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,781
unlike sausage fingers.

221
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,200
Sausage fingers!

222
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,529
Do what I do.

223
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,534
(moans softly)

224
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,026
(playing scales)

225
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,579

00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,583

00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,363
-Lesson over.
-(tires screech, glass crunches)

237
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,366
Lesson over.

238
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,908
(Marge groans)

239
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,486
(tires squeal)

240
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,036
-(gears grind)
-Aah! What are you doing?

241
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,712
I want to go backwards.

242
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,631
Like Russian economy, under Putin.

243
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,339
(tires screech)

244
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,669
Stop making Putin jokes.

245
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,045
You sound like police...

246
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,721
-under Putin.
-(siren whoops)

247
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,640
Ugh. Speaking of police...

248
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,098
I'm sorry, Officer.

249
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,888
I believe my license is, uh...

250
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:24,311
...somewhere in these pairs
of easy-fit blue jeans.

251
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,772
Eh? Eh?

252
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,361
That's not the way
American police do things.

253
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,688
Finally.

254
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,483
Someone who knows
what a traffic stop

255
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,776
is really all about.

256
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,779
Uh, Chief, don't you think
those jeans are a little tight?

257
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:40,662
We're all not high-waisted
like you, Lou, okay?

258
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,751
I'm just gonna lie down
in the backseat here.

259
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,869
(grunts, chuckles)

260
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,616
Okay.

261
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,708
All right, the blue knight
is ready for action!

262
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,254
(grunting)

263
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,144
-(sighs)
-What's wrong?

264
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:04,099
Every note you play sounds
like dying animal writhing on keys.

265
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,271
Awesome!

266
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,809
I just want to get more students

267
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,313
and help my father with his dream.

268
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,149
Buying a limo.

269
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,442
He could tell big shots
in the back that,

270
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,236
no, they cannot smoke.

271
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,699
Seriously, I'm gonna make you proud.

272
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,660
I have hidden talents.

273
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:26,581
Oh, Bort, if only you make
such a miracle happen...

274
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:30,172
I would love your hands forever.

275
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,629
(slowly playing notes)

276
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,921
-(intense classical music plays)
-(horn honking)

277
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,194
Wait a minute.

278
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,649
You can't hear.

279
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,147
(playing continues)

280
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,902
I am so proud.

281
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:01,235
I would've been happy
if Bart was just a piano mover.

282
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,412
(audience applauds)

283
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,742
Thank you.

284
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,156
I owe it all to Zhenya.

285
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,294
Can you teach my boys?

286
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,791
But no tickling the ivories.

287
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,373
You treat them with respect.

288
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,248
-Can you teach my monkey?
-(grunting)

289
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,745
Then I can deal with the Musician's Union

290
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,837
instead of the Humane Society.
Much easier to muscle.

291
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,344
Zhenya, I couldn't have
done it without you.

292
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,586
(whispers) And you.

293
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,305
MARGE: Bart!

294
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,307
Bart, I've never been so proud of you.

295
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,063
Never, never, never!

296
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,606
And now I'll always be
at home in a saloon.

297
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,443
Something smells fishy.

298
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,777
Yar, that would be me.

299
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,201
But I agree.

300
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,859
There's something funny here.

301
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,118
Is it me?

302
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,029
-No!
-Oh...

303
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,406
(bird caws)

304
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,625
Hey, your baseball cap's one
plastic bump tighter than usual.

305
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,879
What gives?

306
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,051
Okay, guys, here's the deal.

307
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,709
I've gone bald.

308
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,968
-(gasps)
-(gasps)

309
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,129
Then again, who cares?

310
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,137
Yeah, you already landed a hot wife.

311
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,849
That's the only reason
men evolved hair.

312
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,009
What are you talking about?

313
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,177
You lured Marge in with your hair.

314
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,806
You trapped her with marriage.

315
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,982
You skinned and field-gutted
her by having kids.

316
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,021
Now she's mounted on your wall for good,

317
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,105
with fake glass eyes and a rubber tongue.

318
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,610
The way you put it, it sounds so perfect,

319
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,863
but it's not.

320
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,034
You sound seriously depressed.

321
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,823
Why don't we talk about it over at Moe's?

322
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,736
-It's not even noon.
-Yeah, I've got a watch, egghead.

323
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,950
I couldn't help overhearing
your predicament.

324
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,667
Mainly because my hearing is so great.

325
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,628
-Who are you?
-The answer to your prayers.

326
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,880
Are you my guardian angel?

327
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,672
If so, can you turn
a pumpkin into a chariot?

328
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,626
Even a used Camry would be okay.

329
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,007
No, just a regular hairless Joe like you.

330
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,305
Been bald since I was 23.

331
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,849
With the money I've saved,
I bought a yacht.

332
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,183
Whoa...

333
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,518
You're cool with it?

334
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,273
I haven't even told my wife.

335
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,864
You wait for the right moment,

336
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,109
you show her that glorious dome,

337
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,901
and then you rest it sweetly on her bosom

338
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,526
and let the kisses flow like rain.

339
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,034
Wow, is that what your wife did?

340
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,486
No wife.

341
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,116
I just slept with thousands of bald women.

342
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,713
(laughing)

343
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,875
(Marge humming)

344
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,089
Caught your recital, Bart.

345
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,880
Lisa, isn't it great

346
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,633
to have a musical genius in the family?

347
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,255
Helen Lovejoy,

348
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,472
you always have to stir the pot.

349
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,142
Unlike you, when you make
your lumpy clam chowder.

350
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,771
I guess Bart must be a musical genius,

351
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,019
because frauds are always found out.

352
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,731
Always.

353
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,027
My work is done.

354
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,164
Now to reward myself with a case of wine.

355
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,662
(doorbell buzzes)

356
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,793
Hi, Zhenya.
I'm here for my lesson.

357
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,752
Good to see you, my love.

358
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,082
Sit on porch.

359
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,167
Are there other people in here?

360
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,091
Because of your performance,

361
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,050
I win many new students.

362
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,590
♪♪

363
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,684
Come on. I got to learn my mom's
stripper music by midnight.

364
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,680
But if I got you all these students,

365
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,852
shouldn't you be grateful?

366
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,060
Oh, of course I'm grateful.

367
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,560
Here is cushion for porch chair.

368
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,728
Go to "bata boom."

369
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,106
(humming)

370
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,821
(grumbles)

371
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,451
Mopped myself into a corner.

372
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,333
-Oh...
-Mom,

373
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,410
you'd still be proud of me
if I couldn't play the piano, right?

374
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,956
Of course.

375
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,079
But very, very, very angry

376
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,747
at all the time I wasted.

377
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,006
-(gulps)
-Gulp? Was that a gulp?

378
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,758
Are you getting a sore throat?

379
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,220
Let me give you some castor oil.

380
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,629
Hmm...

381
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,888
{\an8}(gulping)

382
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,597
You'll need your voice
to say, "Thanks, Mom,"

383
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,183
after your next recital.

384
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,268
My wha...?

385
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:04,652
I signed you up for the 10-And-Below
Talent Show next week. Huh?

386
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,112
You know, I'm almost 11.
It's not really fair.

387
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,153
Bart, when you were on that stage,

388
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,107
it felt like you were pouring those notes

389
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,867
right into my heart.

390
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,659
Hey, one of those notes

391
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,333
could go to your brain and kill you.

392
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,411
Are you sure
you want to take that chance?

393
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:22,326
A proud mother always does.

394
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,666
(whimpers)

395
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,627
First of all, you're over ten years old.

396
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,423
Second, you're clearly Justin Bieber.

397
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,046
That's another 25 bucks we'll never see.

398
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,434
Gosh!

399
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,103
<i>♪ Who can make the sun rise? ♪</i>

400
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,353
Why won't anybody tell me?

00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,685
-(crying)
-(audience applauds)

402
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,112
(heart beating loudly)

403
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,663
Oh... I'm sorry.

404
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,214
-I was faking it.
-(gasps, murmurs)

405
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,126
I lied so I could see Zhenya.

406
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,630
Zhenya. Oh, Zhenya.
Everyone knows Zhenya.

407
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,382
(murmuring)

408
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:14,094
But there's really only one girl
whose opinion matters to me.

409
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,836
My mom.

410
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,058
I'd like to go home now.

411
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,348
And to think you'd do this
on Mother's Day.

412
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,563
Is it too late to make you
breakfast in bed?

413
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,651
(growling in frustration)

414
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,404
Um, Mom?

415
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,106
I'm sorry I pretended to be good at piano.

416
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,237
And I'm really ashamed that I lied.

417
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,874
(doorbell rings)

418
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,241
Excuse me.

419
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,998
Mrs. Marge, I took my driver's test.

420
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,082
Did you pass?

421
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,036
More or less.

422
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,757
If I eat an orange wedge,
the whole thing's gonna blow.

423
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,169
Well, I'm glad your side
of the deal worked out.

424
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,008
What are you talking about?
Your boy is genius!

425
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,014
No, he cheated.

426
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,846
Marge, in Russia,
everyone succeeds by cheating.

427
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,523
Even Russian dressing
is just Thousand Island.

428
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:09,062
-(gasps)
-But your son is a good boy.

429
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,528
He cheated for love,
and he cheated for you.

430
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,027
Thank you!

431
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,369
All right. A chance to make a new friend.

432
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,916
Listen, sweetie...

433
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,960
it was wrong of me
to force my dreams on you.

434
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:34,134
Yeah, your generation won't have
any dreams come true.

435
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,474
Sweetie,
you're just gonna be who you are.

436
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,801
Well, who am I?

437
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,926
You are unique, you are special,

438
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,274
and at some point,
that's gonna come together

439
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,679
and work for you.

440
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,637
-I know it.
-Thanks, Mom.

441
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,308
And that means no punishment, right?

442
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,556
Wrong.

443
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,937
You have to walk
all the way over to Grampa

444
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,735
to take a plate of cookies I baked.

445
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,073
Here's your new plate, Grampa.

446
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,025
Oh, boy! There's crumbs on it!

447
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,496
Marge...

448
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,289
(sighs)

449
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,082
I have something to show you.

450
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,086
Is it your impression
of Mr. Burns eating soup?

451
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,589
Because I'm not in the mood.

452
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,510
No, it's something else.

453
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,843
So?

454
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,802
I've always wondered
what you were hiding

455
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,258
under your curly locks,

456
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,728
my beautiful yellow melon.

457
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,691
Hair, no hair...
I don't really think about it. (laughs)

458
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,323
Confidence is so attractive in a man.

459
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,690
Tell me about it.

460
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,197
Oh, Marge,
when you hold me like that...

461
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,624
Thank you, God.

462
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,167
Shh!
