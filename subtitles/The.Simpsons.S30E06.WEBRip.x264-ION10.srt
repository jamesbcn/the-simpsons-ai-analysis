1
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:09,357
D'oh!

2
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,888
D'oh!

3
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:40,953
Hey.

4
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,323
Old lady... kids...

5
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:04,760
Then the fire go out...

6
00:01:04,803 --> 00:01:06,805
Stupid Flanders.

7
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:09,678
Beer...

8
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:11,854
Only good will come of you.

9
00:01:11,897 --> 00:01:15,597
Hey, it looks like
I just invented English.

10
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,947
I think I'll build a tavern.

11
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,820
Of course, it won't be as clean
and nice as this swamp.

12
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:29,741
Homie, we can't keep inviting
so many people to Thanksgiving.

13
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:31,852
They all drink too much.

14
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:35,443
Use your words.
Who do we cut?

15
00:01:35,486 --> 00:01:37,836
- Flanders.
- We don't invite him.

16
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,621
Let's invite,
then dis-invite him.

17
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:43,407
Okay, I know this is
a tough one, but Moe?

18
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:46,149
Remember last year?
His plus-one?

19
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:47,803
Oh, yeah.

20
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:50,632
Why won't you let me
pop her?

21
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:52,808
No. It's bad juju.

22
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:55,854
So...

23
00:01:55,898 --> 00:01:59,423
we're keeping Thanksgiving
super small this year.

24
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,860
Yeah, I understand.
I won't tell no one I'm invited.

25
00:02:01,904 --> 00:02:04,211
Hey, I was thinking of making
slivered green beans,

26
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:05,908
little bits of bacon,

27
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:07,779
pearl onions in there.

28
00:02:07,823 --> 00:02:09,781
What's the matter?
You don't like pearl onions?

29
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:12,306
Next you'll be
badmouthin' shallots!

30
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:13,394
Actually...

31
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:15,265
you're not invited.

32
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:18,529
And this is how I find out, huh?
By you telling me in person?

33
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:20,662
Gently?
With plenty of notice?!

34
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:22,881
I'm sorry, man.
I'm really sorry.

35
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:24,274
Hey, no problem.

36
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:26,668
I mean, I'm just
your bartender, right?

37
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:28,365
No women, no buddies...

38
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:31,890
Thank God, a friend!

39
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:33,762
Moe's Tavern. Moe speaking.

40
00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:38,027
Hello. I'm looking for
a Mr. Buttface, first name Ima.

41
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,682
Ima? Nobody's been named that
in, like, a hundred years.

42
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:44,164
And as for the rest, why don't
you double-check that name, huh?

43
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:46,427
Try saying it out loud.

44
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,777
Ima Buttface?

45
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,214
Yeah, well, mistakes are
how we learn there, young fella.

46
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:54,435
Good luck in your...
your journey into adulthood.

47
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:55,784
Dude, that was lame.

48
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:57,786
And I'm the king of lame.

49
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,831
I dream about needlepoint.

50
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:04,575
Maybe we should
just give up these prank calls.

51
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:06,403
Yeah. No more
little prank calls.

52
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:09,406
We're gonna go hard core!

53
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,843
Hard core? The only thing
my mom's never done.

54
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:13,932
I'm so proud of her.

55
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:15,543
So, you're looking

56
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:18,546
to acquire some
military-grade mischief makers?

57
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:22,419
I cannot and I will not sell
such items to minors.

58
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:27,076
Welcome to the dark net,
the devil's URL.

59
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:31,689
Even Amazon can't find you here.

60
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,822
Ain't that right, Alexa?

61
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:35,302
Please, I've done nothing.

62
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:37,956
Just shut me off. Please.

63
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:45,834
Welcome to the dark net.

64
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:47,879
Could you stop that, please?

65
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:55,844
Quit scaring us!

66
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:57,149
All right.

67
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:03,634
This is our chance
to get back at Moe.

68
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:05,288
Wait.
What did he do to us?

69
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:07,029
It doesn't matter.
Let's do this!

70
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:09,945
A grenade launcher!

71
00:04:09,988 --> 00:04:13,514
Just like the one my dad
liberated in Afghanistan!

72
00:04:13,557 --> 00:04:17,387
I thought your dad just went out
for smokes and never came back.

73
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:18,910
All right.
The truth is,

74
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:21,957
he left on the first ship
colonizing Mars.

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,481
That's why he can't call
or send checks.

76
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:26,222
But he did send me this.

77
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,616
What? That's just
a lame-o candy bar.

78
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:30,661
I need this, Bart!

79
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:32,663
Fine.
Your dad's on Mars.

80
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,927
You're an enabler!

81
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:37,189
Deadly. Treason.

82
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:38,756
Overpriced.

83
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,889
What about this?

84
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:44,936
That'll break Moe's heart
and his wallet.

85
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:49,637
Well, hello. I'm Hacky.

86
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,161
Here to help you commit
internet crime.

87
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:53,989
Do you want to...

88
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:02,998
But if we're caught,
I morph into Snitchy the weasel

89
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,827
and give all your information
to the FBI.

90
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:13,835
To continue, click agree.

91
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:19,667
The package
should be arriving now.

92
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,190
Cool!

93
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,671
We get to see a taxi.

94
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:30,852
Is this the residence

95
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:35,117
of successful American
businessman Moe Szyslak?

96
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,640
Who wants to know?

97
00:05:36,684 --> 00:05:39,426
Anastasia Alekhova,
his new wife.

98
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:43,386
His wife?!

99
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:47,303
Dark net rules!

100
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,392
And no state sales tax!

101
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:56,356
Well, this is a contract, and
it is my electronic signature,

102
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,835
which I assume
is impossible to fake,

103
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:00,403
but I did not order
no mail-order bride!

104
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,449
- I understand.
- Good.

105
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:04,886
You see me in person,
and you do not want me.

106
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:06,975
No, no.
You got it all wrong.

107
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:09,760
It's me. I can't take
another heartbreak.

108
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:13,634
My only friends are the ghosts
that came with the bar.

109
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:16,506
<i>Drinkity drink
da drink da drink</i>

110
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,075
<i>I woke up in a henhouse
this morn</i>

111
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:21,642
<i>Drinkity drink
da drink da drink</i>

112
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:24,645
<i>But I still wasn't drunk</i>

113
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:27,778
<i>As the day I was born</i>

114
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:29,650
Back in my head, Fats.

115
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:31,695
Oh, there's a lot
of dark thoughts in there.

116
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:33,523
I didn't wanna die here.

117
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:36,744
I just came in
to use the phone.

118
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:38,354
Sweetheart,
we'll straighten this out.

119
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,921
I'll overnight youse
back to Russia,

120
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:42,663
and, oh, boy, I'm sorry
to say this, but...

121
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:43,707
but on Delta.

122
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,275
Where are my manners?

123
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:47,624
Let me show you around.

124
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:51,585
Pool table, jukebox...

125
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:54,457
Barney.

126
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:55,893
We have alcoholics too.

127
00:06:55,937 --> 00:06:57,721
But ours are thin,
with ropey muscles.

128
00:06:57,765 --> 00:06:59,462
What's this?

129
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:00,811
That's the Love Tester.

130
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:02,552
You just stick a nickel in it,

131
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:04,772
and it tells you
what's in your heart.

132
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:09,603
Am I falling for her?

133
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:11,605
I think it knows
what I'm feeling.

134
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,172
And what I'm having
for dinner.

135
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:15,739
Who can guess

136
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:18,568
what oil I sautÃ©ed
these vegetables in?

137
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:20,744
Olive? Canola?

138
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:22,224
Oh, not this game.

139
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:24,531
Coconut? Grape-seed?

140
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:26,576
Yeah, fantastic
conversation, Marge.

141
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,839
I don't hear an oil.

142
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:30,537
- Peanut?
- Guess again.

143
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,581
Sunflower?

144
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,148
Walnut?

145
00:07:34,758 --> 00:07:36,717
No, no and no.

146
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,110
This is why I had kids.

147
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:41,156
The answer is...

148
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,593
- Finally.
- Vegetable oil!

149
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:45,160
Hey, vegetable oil!
Good one, Marge.

150
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:47,945
Did you hear Moe accidentally
bought a wife online?

151
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:52,733
Excuse me.
How can mail-order brides

152
00:07:52,776 --> 00:07:55,083
still be a thing
in this day and age?

153
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:58,782
Lisa, ignorant men and
foolish women sometimes do

154
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:01,655
dumb things to find love.

155
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:03,831
Or maybe it was a master hack

156
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:06,964
by an unknown genius.

157
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:09,750
Maybe this will
turn out great for Moe.

158
00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:12,187
Sometimes arranged marriages
are the best.

159
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,406
I mean,
look at Tevye and Golde.

160
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,410
They had a wonderful life
with that fiddler in the shtetl.

161
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:20,500
It wasn't that great
for Tzeitel.

162
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:22,763
How many times
do I have to tell you

163
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:26,418
that Lazar Wolf the butcher
was a good provider!

164
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:28,464
Well, I'm not marrying
a butcher.

165
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,553
Young lady,
you should be so lucky

166
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:32,555
if that Van Houten
is a butcher.

167
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,514
I'm not marrying Milhouse!

168
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:36,472
Oy! She won't marry
a butcher.

169
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,780
She won't marry Milhouse.
What is a father to do?

170
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:42,565
<i>What is a man
with three little children</i>

171
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:45,699
<i>Three little children to do?</i>

172
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:46,700
<i>I'll tell y...</i>

173
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:49,790
Hey, listen,

174
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,922
if you want to stay
a few more days,

175
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:53,834
it's fine with...

176
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:57,667
I ain't seen fresh flowers
since my ma died.

177
00:08:57,711 --> 00:08:59,626
She got hit by a flower truck.

178
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:01,758
Let's try this place.
It looks cute.

179
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:03,543
I've never been inside before.

180
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:05,414
I thought it was
a horrible dive.

181
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:07,285
Well, I thought
it was a crack house.

182
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:09,592
But now I'd like a glass
of white wine.

183
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:11,507
There's a white wine?
I mean, yeah!

184
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,769
I'll be right with you.

185
00:09:14,945 --> 00:09:17,644
Look at all the meat
in the seats!

186
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:20,821
That grosses me out.
Good-bye.

187
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:21,909
Would you look at me?

188
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:23,824
My mouth is running
like a toilet!

189
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:24,868
Outrageous!

190
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:25,869
Wait, wait, wait.

191
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:28,350
My friend speaks
like peasant,

192
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:30,918
but he makes a whiskey
sour to die for.

193
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:32,920
What the hell's a
whiskey sour?

194
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:34,617
Will you be quiet?

195
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:35,836
Come back in.

196
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:38,621
I promise you
a safe, happy time.

197
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:43,887
- Looks good.
- I feel better.

198
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:47,064
So, Moe, I do good?

199
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:49,327
I work hard, clean up bar.

200
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:52,461
I even chase out
moose and squirrel.

201
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:54,768
Hey, let's take our
patronage elsewhere, Moose.

202
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:58,162
Duh, what's a patronage?

203
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:05,692
Oh, look, Anastasia,
it ain't that I don't like ya.

204
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:07,476
I like ya plenty.

205
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,695
Too plenty.

206
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,307
Here's the sad truth
about me.

207
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,701
Every time I give my heart
to a woman,

208
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:17,355
it gets broke
into a hundred pieces.

209
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:20,532
My first crush...

210
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:22,709
So, I really like ya,
and I was wondering,

211
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:26,756
you know, maybe we could go
to a movie or something?

212
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,758
Give me one second.

213
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,726
You gotta come out
sometime!

214
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:42,685
We've been using
the back door.

215
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:44,774
Damn it.

216
00:10:44,818 --> 00:10:47,690
Then a couple of years ago,
sweet Maya...

217
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:49,997
And then, of course,

218
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,781
Laney Fontaine.

219
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:53,348
I'm through with ya, Moe!

220
00:10:53,391 --> 00:10:55,437
You're a worthless train
to nowhere,

221
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,700
and this is my stop!

222
00:10:57,744 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah!

223
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:06,056
She won a Tony tearing me apart,
yet I left humming the songs.

224
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,712
Poor Moe. In Russia, we have
word for people like you.

225
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,716
Oh, that sounds nice,
what does it mean?

226
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,937
It means gentle heart
that no one sees.

227
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,852
Wow, that's beautiful.

228
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:19,940
Maybe I should learn Russian.

229
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:21,942
No, don't do that.

230
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:25,380
But if you want me to,
I'll go.

231
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:27,774
Wait.
I can't let you go like that.

232
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:30,907
Can you take these bottles
to the recycling?

233
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:32,779
Keep the nickels for yourself.

234
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,786
Delivery for Dr. Ima Buttface.

235
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:41,831
That's me.
Where do I sign?

236
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,615
Nowhere.
I was never here.

237
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:46,053
But I would appreciate
a good review on Dark Yelp.

238
00:11:46,096 --> 00:11:49,926
Any less than three stars
and...

239
00:11:52,515 --> 00:11:54,801
One Sumatran Breeding Rat,

240
00:11:54,844 --> 00:11:56,933
already in labor.

241
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:58,935
You paid for mail-order rats

242
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:01,459
when your grandfather's
nursing home is full of them?

243
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:03,810
All right, boy.
I'm gonna find out

244
00:12:03,853 --> 00:12:06,029
just what you've been up to.

245
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:11,426
Oh, Mom, thank God.

246
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:12,862
This one's brighter.

247
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:14,516
Now talk.

248
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,387
What are you up to?

249
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:18,259
All right,
we'll make you talk.

250
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:19,956
Give me your phone.

251
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:32,664
That poor rice.

252
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,101
I'm gonna dunk your phone

253
00:12:34,144 --> 00:12:36,756
and there won't be any rice
to save it.

254
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:39,933
Okay, okay.

255
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:41,891
I ordered Moe's
mail-order bride.

256
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:44,938
You're gonna be punished, boy.

257
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:47,549
What about Moe?
That poor, lonely man.

258
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:48,855
Right as always, Marge.

259
00:12:48,898 --> 00:12:50,682
I'll head directly to Moe's.

260
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:52,075
It's the only decent
thing to do.

261
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:53,947
- Yes. Good.
- Good.

262
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,514
I might have to console him
till closing time...

263
00:12:56,558 --> 00:13:00,736
Well, now that it's just you,
no punishment, right?

264
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,782
I used a computer.

265
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:04,827
Isn't that wonderful?

266
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,310
<i>I'm stuck in Folsom Prison</i>

267
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:13,575
<i>And time keeps
dragging on...</i>

268
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:15,795
Start again.

269
00:13:16,057 --> 00:13:19,060
<i>When I was just a baby</i>

270
00:13:19,103 --> 00:13:21,539
<i>My mama told me, son</i>

271
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,671
<i>Always be a good boy...</i>

272
00:13:22,714 --> 00:13:25,065
Moe, I'm here to apologize.

273
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:26,501
It don't matter, she's gone.

274
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:28,851
She's working at the Russian
Tea Room in Ogdenville.

275
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:31,723
It was my no-good kid
that ordered your wife.

276
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:33,813
It don't matter.
Nothing matters.

277
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:37,207
Hey, Moe. You think I haven't
been disappointed by love?

278
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:40,210
Well, I haven't,
but you've got to get her back.

279
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:42,038
Okay, I'll go to Ogdenville.

280
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:44,084
I'll get her back.

281
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:47,391
For once in my life I ain't
gonna be afraid of getting hurt.

282
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:49,741
Follow your dreams.

283
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:51,569
I'm following mine.

284
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:52,875
Where's Moe?

285
00:13:57,793 --> 00:13:59,099
Is Anastasia here?

286
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:00,491
She's just getting off work.

287
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:02,015
Great, perfect.

288
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:03,364
I'm gonna win her back.

289
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:04,887
That's nice.

290
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:07,542
You probably should check
with her boyfriend.

291
00:14:07,585 --> 00:14:09,587
You look just like
the Pennywise.

292
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:11,633
I know. It's terrible.

293
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:15,158
Now when I'm in the gutter and
call kids for help, nothin'.

294
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:17,987
She's got a boyfriend?

295
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:19,467
Boy, you never know how much

296
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,165
you really love something
until you've lost it.

297
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:24,907
Did you ever lose anything?

298
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:27,388
My husband, my home

299
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:29,738
and TV show Armenian Idol.

300
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:31,566
- Twice.
- Yeah.

301
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,227
I never should've
told her to go.

302
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,011
Look, Moe, I'll tell you
how to get her back, okay?

303
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:44,405
You take her to dinner,
nice and romantic.

304
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:46,407
Look into her eyes
and remind her

305
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,062
that she is under contract
to marry you.

306
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:51,891
I don't know, man,
that doesn't seem woke.

307
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,631
And I'm woke as hell.

308
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:56,156
It doesn't matter how it
started, you two fell in love.

309
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:57,853
It's like the kind of movie

310
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,855
we wish Tom Hanks would go back
to making.

311
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,163
I know. How many captains
can one guy play?

312
00:15:03,206 --> 00:15:04,947
You're right about that.

313
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:05,992
You're right about everything,
you guys.

314
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:07,515
You know what?
I'm gonna do it.

315
00:15:07,558 --> 00:15:08,951
Oh, my God, I've got hope.

316
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:10,910
I'm lookin' forward
to the future.

317
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:14,043
Fellas, I'm gonna put on pants.

318
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,918
Now just so you know,
technically,

319
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,963
I'm still married
to Rita Moreno.

320
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:21,964
Over here.

321
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:23,009
Here. Hey, please?

322
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:26,012
Excuse me, Krusteleh.

323
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,928
Now, dear, I'm a little nervous,

324
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:31,278
because I got something
real important to say.

325
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:34,455
You had a good thing going
and you ruined it.

326
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:36,196
Not for the first time
either.

327
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:39,808
You know my bar was originally
an eight-story hotel?

328
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:42,071
What does this have to do
with me?

329
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:44,160
This time, it's not too late...
I hope.

330
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:45,901
I love you, Ana.

331
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,817
I don't know how I feel
right now, Moe.

332
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,559
But if you promise me a wedding
according to my traditions...

333
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:53,300
A deal is a deal.

334
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,215
A deal is a deal.

335
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:57,957
How I have longed
to hear those words.

336
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,263
Sorry, Krusty. It's over.

337
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:05,225
No, no! I just got TMZ here
to film our relationship.

338
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:06,835
We got a breakup, even better.

339
00:16:06,878 --> 00:16:08,010
Zoom in on his broken heart.

340
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:10,491
No. No, no, no.

341
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:13,276
No.

342
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,452
Need another take?

343
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:29,901
Hey! Can I get
a little service here?

344
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:32,469
Yeah. Excuse me.
I'm also working this event.

345
00:16:32,513 --> 00:16:33,993
Your own marriage?

346
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,646
Tastefully. Tastefully.

347
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,910
And we are waiting on one
very special guest.

348
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:40,782
Duffman is here.

349
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:43,219
With these
Duff Drink-A-Day Calendars.

350
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,614
There's something brewing
every day of the year.

351
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:49,008
Except for Pearl Harbor Day.

352
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,010
Never forget.

353
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:54,317
Now let's get the show
on the road.

354
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:57,320
Duffman has a beer mitzvah
at 4:00.

355
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:58,974
Putting the brew in Hebrew.

356
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,236
Oh, yeah.

357
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:07,983
Mom, this costume's
embarrassing.

358
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,941
It's your last punishment.

359
00:17:09,985 --> 00:17:12,074
Also, you look cute.

360
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:18,820
When I was little,
I used to dream of a man

361
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:22,084
in the most velour tracksuit
there could be,

362
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:24,217
who would sweep me off
to an apartment

363
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,654
shared by only
four other families.

364
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:29,352
I just want to say that
you've made me very happy,

365
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:32,355
which, boy, I thought
I could never be.

366
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:34,053
And now the signing

367
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:36,838
of the traditional orthodox
marriage papers.

368
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:40,755
Ring boy, please bring
my notary stamp.

369
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:42,800
I can scratch this off
my bucket list.

370
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:44,846
Wait a minute.

371
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:48,458
I've been learning Russian,
on the dark net, and this says,

372
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:50,286
Moe gives...

373
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:54,943
all...

374
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:56,988
his...

375
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:59,382
personal property to Ana.

376
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:00,992
This looks airtight.

377
00:18:01,036 --> 00:18:03,604
And believe me,
I know marriage law.

378
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,433
Yeah, I read him divorce decrees
to get him to go to sleep.

379
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:08,174
Boom-chaka-laka!

380
00:18:08,217 --> 00:18:09,958
Ana, is this true?

381
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:13,788
No. It's just another one
of their stupid pranks.

382
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:18,097
My sweet Moe, there is no way
to fake what we have.

383
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:22,971
Oh, I can't do it.

384
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:24,494
I just, I can't risk
another heartbreak.

385
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:26,714
I'm... I'm sorry.

386
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,848
So, am I still
getting paid?

387
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:33,068
Wait, you're not from Russia?

388
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,461
No, Brooklyn.

389
00:18:34,504 --> 00:18:37,246
Back when Brooklyn was Brooklyn.

390
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,987
You know what I mean?

391
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,989
Ana, what about you?

392
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:43,034
I'm not Russian at all.

393
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:44,906
I'm from Columbus, Ohio.

394
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:46,603
That's even worse.

395
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:48,736
Ana, you're a scam artist.

396
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:50,259
And one that didn't aim
too high.

397
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:51,652
What do you mean?

398
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:53,001
You know I'm in debt, right?

399
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:55,395
Serious, serious debt.

400
00:18:55,438 --> 00:18:57,919
Just look at my invites.

401
00:18:57,962 --> 00:18:59,442
You still wanna marry me?

402
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:04,795
Well, it looks like this just
became a shotgun wedding.

403
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:08,147
It's time for youse two
to leave.

404
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,279
Fine.
I'll find another man

405
00:19:10,323 --> 00:19:12,063
and give him
what he dreams of.

406
00:19:12,107 --> 00:19:13,848
I just have to...

407
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:16,503
speak a little like this.

408
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:19,506
Or maybe Scottish, like...

409
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:21,638
Oh, do my ears deceive me?

410
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:24,163
Are you from the Highlands?

411
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:27,340
Aye. Between Inverness
and the Moray Firth.

412
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:28,776
Oh, well, you'll love this guy.

413
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:30,430
He's loaded.

414
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:33,433
Let's go.

415
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:36,784
Wait. Why are you wearing
a wedding dress?

416
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:38,655
Is it because you're a loon

417
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:41,354
that got stood up
and can't get over it?

418
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:45,488
Just like Mother.

419
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:47,882
- When are we gonna warn Willie?
- Why do we have to warn Willie?

420
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:49,492
- He doesn't have any money.
- Okay.

421
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:50,928
Then when are we gonna warn her?

422
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:52,408
We don't need to warn her.

423
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:55,368
Her heart is as cold as
a Rocky Mountain Duff.

424
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:58,414
D.J. Kirk,
let's get this party rockin'.

425
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:01,809
Did somebody say crank up
the volume?

426
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:07,771
- No one said crank up the volume.
- Dammit.

427
00:20:18,129 --> 00:20:19,392
Papa?

428
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:23,526
Son, it's...
it's so great to see you.

429
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:28,401
I wanna hear everything about
your top secret mission.

430
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:29,750
Of course. Of course.

431
00:20:29,793 --> 00:20:31,752
Let me just go get
some space cigarettes

432
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:33,971
and we'll have
a long, long talk.

433
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:36,278
I'd like that.

434
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:38,976
Oh, I finally have a dad again.
