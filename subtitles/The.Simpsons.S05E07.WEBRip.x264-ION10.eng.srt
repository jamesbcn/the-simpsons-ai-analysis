00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,959
Uh-oh. You're in for it
now, Dad.

165
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,170
Marge, I'm feeling
a lot of shame right now.

166
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,715
I'm hearing that
you feel a lot of shame.

167
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,839
And I feel that
you hear my shame.

168
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:58,676
I'm feeling annoyance
and frustration, but also tolerance.

169
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:03,064
-I feel validated by that.
-Good. I'm glad we had this talk.

170
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,234
Me too.
(whistles)

171
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,233
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

172
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,109
Wow! For free.

173

175
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,873

Who needs Brad Goodman?

177
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,924
Well, here we are
at the Brad Goodman lecture.

178
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,465
-We know, Dad.
-I just thought I'd remind everybody.

179
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,549
After all, we did agree
to attend a self-help seminar.

180
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,546
What an odd thing to say.

181
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,058
-(applause)
-Thank you.

182
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,641
Okay, folks.
Let me hear what's troubling you.

183
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,226
Don't be shy. Yell it out. Everybody. Go.

184
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,692
-I, uh, can't commit to a relationship.
-I'm too nice.

185
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,574
-I have problems with--
-I'm always interrupting people.

186
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:58,162
Okay. Okay. Right now, I want each of you
to try something interesting.

187
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,040
There's no trick to it.
It's just a simple trick.

188
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:05,868
Now, close your eyes for a moment and
really listen to that inner voice inside.

189
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,576
Your inner child.

190
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,958
(quietly)
Listen. What's he saying?

191
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,545
Stay the course, Big Ned.
You're doing super.

192
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:19,099
-Food goes in here.
-It sure does.

193
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,138
(Italian accent)
Hey, Moe. What'sa matter?

194
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,814
-You no talka with your accent no more.
-Mamma mia.

195
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:30,654
Principal Skinner,
let's try some rage work.

196
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:34,031
I want you to pretend this dummy
right here is your mother.

197
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,900
Okay, I'll try.
(chuckles)

198
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:40,616
Tell this dummy mother
exactly how you feel right now.

199
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,370
I'm annoyed with you, Mother.
Not just annoyed, angry.

200
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:49,003
I'm a grown man now,
and I can run my own life!

201
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,463
(grunting)

202
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:56,474
(whispering) Shh-shh. Calm down.
Calm down. Moving. You can sit down now.

203
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,509
We're still going antiquing
on Saturday, right, Mother?

204
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:04,643
You see, folks?
We're all trying to please someone else.

205
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,024
And as soon as you're not
a human being,

206
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,022
you're a human doing.

207
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:14,225
-Then what comes next?
-A human going!

208
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:18,316
-(laughter)
-Bart, be quiet.

209
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,914
Son, that's wonderful.
Come here. Come up here.

210
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,329
What made you
yell out that remark?

211
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,750
I don't know.

212
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:29,118
You just wanted
to express yourself, yes?

213
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,956
-I do what I feel like.
-That's marvelous.

214
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,502
I couldn't have
put it better myself.

215
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,547
"I do what I feel like."

216
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:44,262
People, this young man here is
the inner child I've been talking about.

217
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,306
What?

218
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,099
Son, you've never read
any of my books, have you?

219
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,564

I'm not so old-fashioned.

221
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:59,896

Mama? Papa? Could you come up here?

223
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,656
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

224
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:10,163
This is really remarkable. Here we have
a man with an obvious eating disorder,

225
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:15,497
and a woman with a bizarre hairstyle--
I'm sure worn only for shock value.

226
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,706
-(groans)
-And yet,

227
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,757
they've managed to raise
an emotionally healthy son.

228
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,722
-That's fantastic.
-Oh, thank you.

229
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,264
We can all learn a lot
from this young man here.

230
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,017
-This-this--
-Rudiger.

231
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:32,598
Rudiger. And if we can all
be more like little Rudiger--

232
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,306
-His name is Bart.
-His name isn't important.

233
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:39,897
What's important here is that this lad
has fully developed ego integrity...

234
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:44,065
with well-defined boundaries.

235
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,326

(yells)

332
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:08,856
-(all gasp)
-Hey. Wait a minute. Hold on here.

333
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:12,109
This bandstand
wasn't double-bolted. Huh.

334
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,652
-I didn't feel like it.
-Hey. I hear you, buddy.

335
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:19,447
Uh, I don't want to judge
the rightness of your ego orientation,

336
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,453
but my inner critic says
you should've done your job.

337
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:26,456
Hey, now, Marge.
Let's not "should" this fella to death.

338
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,420
Yeah. Next you'll be laying a guilt-trip
on me for not oiling that Ferris wheel.

339
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,012
-(loud screeching)
-(riders screaming)

340
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:38,335
(screaming continues)

341
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,020
(various animal noises)

342
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:48,559
-(screaming)
-(elephant trumpeting)

343
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,685
In the, uh, spirit of the occasion,
I must tell you what I think.

344
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,233
You two screwed up royal.

345
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:57,317
You know, I really don't feel
like being blamed.

346
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,994
I feel that you should shut up.

347
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,992
You know, you really
irritate me, Skinner.

348
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,954
What with your store-bought haircut
and excellent posture.

349
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,746
Mister, I can't stand
the sound of your voice.

350
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,750
-Oh, really? Come here.
-Oh!

351
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,042
Oh, now, now. There's no need
to resort to violence.

352
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:15,006
-Aw, sure there is.
-(clamoring)

353
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,680
I knew it.
If only I had nagged more.

354
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,720
God is angry. We've made
a false idol of this Brad Goodman.

355
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,426
No. You must not
blame yourself, Reverend.

356
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,397
You must blame that little boy.
He started it all.

357
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,269
-Get him!
-Eep.

358
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,476
(crowd jeering)

359
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,651
-Here, boy. In here.
-Huh?

360
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,575
Hold on, son.

361
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,916
(engine puttering)

362
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,415
So long, suckers.

363
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,338
Damn. They're very slowly
getting away.

364
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,717
-They're heading for the old mill.
-No, we're not.

365
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,636
Well, let's go to the old mill anyway,
get some cider.

366
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,805
-MAN: That's a good idea.
-Let's get some cider.

367
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:17,321
Aw, boy. If only Bart had been
a better role model for everyone.

368
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,651
That's not fair.
The lesson here is that...

369
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:23,236
self-improvement is better left
to people who live in big cities.

370
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,993
No. Self-improvement can be achieved,
but not with a quick fix.

371
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,577
It's a long, arduous journey of
personal and spiritual discovery.

372
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:34,084
That's what I've been saying.
We're all fine the way we are.

373
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,457
-(TV clicks on)
-Ooh, it's that new show...

374
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,755
about the policeman who solves
crimes in his spare time.

375
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,969
Crank it, Homer.

376
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,468
MAN (on TV): <i>You busted up that</i>
<i>crack house pretty bad, McGonigle.</i>

377
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,101
<i>Did you really have to</i>
<i>break so much furniture?</i>

378
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,808
MCGONIGLE: <i>You tell me, Chief.</i>
<i>You had a pretty good view</i>

379
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,139
<i>from behind your desk.</i>

380
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:52,854
Ah, McGonigle eases
the pain.

381
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,556
{\an8}CHIEF: <i>You're off the case,</i>
<i>McGonigle.</i>

382

{\an8}MCGONIGLE: <i>You're off</i>
your <i>case, Chief.</i>

383
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,935
{\an8}CHIEF:
<i>What does that mean exactly?</i>

384
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,486
{\an8}HOMER: It means he gets results,
you stupid chief!

385
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,450
{\an8}-LISA:  Dad, sit down.
-HOMER: Oh, I'm sorry.

386
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,284

00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,486
Shh!
