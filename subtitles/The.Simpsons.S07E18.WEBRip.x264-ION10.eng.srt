00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,868
Alright gentlemen,
I'll take your case,

173
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,627
but I'm going
to have to ask

174
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,918
for a thousand-dollar
retainer.

175
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,421
A thousand dollars?

176
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,963
But your ad says
"no money down."

177
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,550
Oh! They got this
all screwed up.

178
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,545
(squeaking)

179
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,979
-So you don't work on a contingency basis?
-No. Money down.

180
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,230
Oops. I shouldn't have this
Bar Association logo here either.

181
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,613
Hey, Dad? Can I have
a thousand dollars?

182
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,488
All right.
Wait a minute! For what?

183
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,075
-To pay for a lawyer for my bum.
-Forget it.

184
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,088
I thought I recognized you.

185
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,169
I gave you a plate
of corn muffins

186
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,625
back in 1947
to paint my chicken coop,

187
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,257
and you never did it.

188
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,053
Those corn muffins
were lousy.

189
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,257
-Paint my chicken coop!
-Make me.

190
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,597
(thuds and groans)

191
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,104
That does it.
One of them has to go.

192
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:07,436
-Okay. Grampa.
-No. The B-U-M.

193
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,073
-Oh...
-Wait, wait, wait.

194
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,030
There's an easy way
to get rid of Chester

195
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,900
without the guilt of sending him
back to the gutter...

196
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,567
And all it will cost you
is a thousand dollars.

197
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,460
(gunshots over screaming
and laughing)

198
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,749
Exhibit "A":

199
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,502
<i>Steamboat Itchy,</i> dated 1928--

200
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,415
the very first
Itchy & Scratchy cartoon,

201
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,844
and the credits clearly state

202
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,303
"Written, directed
and created

203
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,354
"by Roger Myers.

204
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,388
"Music by Roger Myers
and George Gershwin.

205
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,642
"Produced by Roger Myers
and Joseph P. Kennedy.

206
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,654
Copyright 1928 by Roger Myers."

207
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:50,148
You will also notice Mr. Myers'
name and copyright notice

208
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,232
on the original drawings
of the other members

209
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,068
{\an8}of the Itchy & Scratchy family:

210
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,283
{\an8}"Brown-nose Bear,
Disgruntled Goat

211
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,124
{\an8}"Flatulent Fox,
Rich Uncle Skeleton,

212
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,160
{\an8}and Dinner Dog."

213
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,663
My client's film predates
all of those things, Your Honor.

214
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,627
Oh, yes! I've forgotten!

215
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,378
Your famous film!

216
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,420
The one you destroyed
before the trial

217
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,224
and haven't been able
to find another copy of.

218
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,798
Oh, yes, that film.

219
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,223
Yes.

220
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,101
You don't have a copy, do you?

221
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,058
Krusty, have you ever seen

222
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:24,098
this so-called
animation genius before?

223
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,733
-Yes, I have!
-You have?

224
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,271
I gave him a couple of blintzes
to paint my fence,

225
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,605
but he never did it.

226
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,820
Those blintzes were terrible.

227
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,609
-Paint my fence!
-Make me.

228
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,243
You give me back
those blintzes!

229
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,910
Order, order. We don't care
about your blintzes.

230
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,954
Now, Mr. Lampwick,

231
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,124
when Roger Myers stole
your character...

232
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,333
-Objection.
-Sustained.

233
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,294
If I hear "objection"
and "sustained"

234
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,674
one more time today,
I think I'm going to scream.

235
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,921
-Objection.
-Sustained.

236
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:53,883
(screaming)

237
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,763
Roger Myers didn't create
any of his characters.

238
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,170
He stole them all.

239
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,968
-He stole them all?
-(crowd murmuring)

240
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,512
{\an8}The only characters Myers
could ever come up with

241
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,806
{\an8}were pathetic stick figures
with the words "sarcastic horse"

242
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,981
{\an8}and "manic mailman" printed
on them, and they stank.

243
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,061
So he started stealing
other people's characters.

244
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:16,068
-That's a lie!
-Are you saying under oath, Mr. Myers,

245
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,572
that your father didn't steal
any of the characters

246
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,204
associated with your studio?

247
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,201
Well, I don't think
I am under oath,

248
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,623
but, yes,
my father created them all

249
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:28,122
except for Flatulent Fox--
that was based on a true story--

250
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,455
but he did create Itchy.

251
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,330
That's one thing
I am sure of.

252
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,877
Mr. Hutz, we've been in here
for four hours.

253
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,841
Do you have any evidence at all?

254
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,471
Well, Your Honor,

255
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,338
we've got plenty
of hearsay and conjecture.

256
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,175
Those are kinds of evidence.

257
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,390
Your Honor,
I move for dismissal.

258
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,556
I've got it!
Dad, give me $750.

259
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,853
Okay.

260
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,188
Keep the trial going.

261
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,572
I'll be right back.

262
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,938
Your Honor, I'd like to call

263
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,235
all of my surprise
witnesses again.

264
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,819
(crowd groaning)

265
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,414
-(register rings)
-MERCHANT: Thank you.

266
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,207
I knew I had seen this
exact scene somewhere else.

267
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,751
It was in the movie
Mr. Lampwick showed me.

268
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:18,585
Ladies and gentlemen,
this drawing was made in 1919,

269
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,012
nine years before Roger Myers

270
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,591
made his first
Itchy & Scratchy cartoon.

271
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,347
That could have been drawn by
anyone at any time, Your Honor.

272
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,310
There's no signature or date.

273
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,271
Look under the frame, Brad.

274
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,982
Careful...

275
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,482
careful... whoops.

276
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,613
It's there!

277
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,690
Hmm...

278
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,565
"To Roger Myers,
keep drawing.

279
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,453
"Your moxie more than makes up
for your lack of talent.

280
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,281
"Your pal, Chester J. Lampwick.

281
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,197
September 3, 1919."

282
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:51,155
(crowd clamoring)

283
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,287
Okay, maybe my Dad
did steal Itchy,

284
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,575
but so what?

285
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,248
Animation is built
on plagiarism.

286
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,047
If it weren't for someone
plagiarizing <i>The Honeymooners,</i>

287
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,131
we wouldn't have
<i>The Flintstones.</i>

288
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,387
If someone hadn't
ripped off <i>Sgt. Bilko,</i>

289
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,219
there'd be no <i>Top Cat.</i>

290
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:10,474
Huckleberry Hound,
Chief Wiggum, Yogi Bear. Hah!

291
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,268
Andy Griffith,
Edward G. Robinson, Art Carney.

292
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,652
Your Honor, you take away
our right to steal ideas,

293
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,400
where are they going
to come from?

294
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,902
Her?

295
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,824
Uh... hmm.

296
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,452
How about...

297
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,949
Ghost Mutt?

298
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,700
The court rules
in favor of Mr. Lampwick.

299
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,663
Itchy & Scratchy Studios

300
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,833
will pay a restitution
of $800 billion...

301
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,753
though that amount will probably
come down a bit on appeal.

302
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:47,927
I hope you're happy, kid.
The studio's bankrupt.

303
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,602
You just killed
Itchy & Scratchy.

304
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,729
-We killed Itchy & Scratchy?
-Good riddance.

305
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,522
Want to go celebrate?

306
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,896
I feel like
liver and onions.

307
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,903
(smacking lips)
Mmm...

308
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,410
(generator powering down)

309
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,157
What are you going to do with
all your money, Mr. Lampwick?

310
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,877
Well, first off,
here's your $1,000 back

311
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,629
for hiring that lawyer,
and $750 for the drawing.

312
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,803
And here's a couple of bucks
for your trouble.

313
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,052
Whoo-hoo! Look, Marge,
a couple of bucks.

314
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,264
As for the rest of it,
I'm going to buy the one thing

315
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,306
I've been dreaming of all the
years I spent in the gutter--

316
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,560
a solid-gold house.

317
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,103
(whistling)

318
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,992
Well, Itchy & Scratchy
are gone,

319
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,370
but here's a cartoon that tries
to make learning fun.

320
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,028
(unenthusiastic chuckle)

321
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,576
Ohh.

322
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,540
Sorry about this, kids,
but stay tuned.

323
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,040
We got some real good
toy commercials

324
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,501
coming right up, I swear.

325
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:04,128
Hey! Who left all this garbage
on the steps of Congress?

326
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,553
I'm not garbage.

327
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,761

328
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,931

336

But why can't we just make a law
against flag burning?

337
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,455
AMENDMENT: Because that law
would be unconstitutional.

338
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,080
But if we change
the constitution--

339
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,287
Then we could make
all sorts of crazy laws!

340
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,958
Now you're catching on.

341
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,756
What the hell is this?

342
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,590
It's one those campy
'70s throwbacks

343
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,585
that appeals to
Generation Xers.

344
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,007
We need another Vietnam to
thin out their ranks a little.

345
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,716
What if people say
you're not good enough

346
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,426
to be in The Constitution?

347
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,056

348

349

350
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:11,408
Good news, amendment.
They ratified you.

351
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,658
You're in the U.S. Constitution.

352
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,042
Oh, yeah!
Door's open, boys.

353
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,619
-(loud yucking)
-(gunshots and laughter)

354
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,666
(imitating Curly) Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo,
whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

355
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,091
So it's true.

356
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,009
Some cartoons do
encourage violence.

357
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,758
Ow! We got to get
Itchy & Scratchy back.

358
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,221
And soon!

359
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,181
-Ow!
-Heh-heh.

360
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,562
You've got to make more
Itchy & Scratchy cartoons.

361
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:43,021
The judge says it's okay as long
as you pay Mr. Lampwick royalties.

362
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,943
Royalties? Ha!

363
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,572
I don't have the money
to produce the cartoons.

364
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,239
I lost everything.
I can't even keep

365
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,449
my Dad's head in the freaking
cryogenic center anymore.

366
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,910
-(liquid dripping)
-(thud)

367
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,331
You comfortable in there,
Daddy?

368
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,289
Look, if money's
the only problem,

369
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,869
I know a guy who
has lots of it.

370
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,712
Shoe shine, sir?

371
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,464
Comb your hair for you?

372
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,455
-Sir?
-Hmm.

373
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,666
Sir. Sir? Sir?

374
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,877
Okay, catch you
on the way back.

375
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,837
-Oh, hi, kids.
-Hi, Chester.

376
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,298
Listen. Would you pay

377
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,347
to make more Itchy
& Scratchy cartoons?

378
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,021
-You'll get more royalties.
-I don't need any more money.

379
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:26,021
I'm not greedy. As long as I've got
my health, and my millions of dollars,

380
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,515
and my gold house,
and my rocket car,

381
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,107
I don't need anything else.

382
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,442
-Yes, but--
-Not interested.

383
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,988
(snoring)

384
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:38,871
-Dad, can we have $183,000?
-What for?

385
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,501
Lisa and I want to finance
a series of animated cartoons.

386
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,208
Oh, forget it.

387
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,633
Oh... I give up.

388
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,710
-There's nothing we can do.
-Yeah, I agree.

389
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,717
You want to start on trying
to get Apu out of jail?

390
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,340
Okay.

391
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,758
Wait, kids! You can't give up
on Itchy & Scratchy.

392
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,638
You're always so good
at these things.

393
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,354
Why, together, you've reunited
Krusty with his father,

394
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,145
gotten Principal Skinner's
job back,

395
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,939
and helped Dr. Riviera

396
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,402
perform open-heart surgery
on your father.

397
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,443
You've even foiled
Sideshow Bob

398
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,657
on five separate occasions,
and he's an evil genius.

399
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,828
You're right, Mom.
I'm sure if we put our minds to it

400
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,408
we can solve this one too.

401
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,919
(gasps):
Bart, look at this.

402
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,960
(panting)
What a perfect plan.

403
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,384
Now, Roger Myers' hotel
is just--

404
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,303
And so, when no one
could think

405
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,842
of a plan to resurrect
Itchy & Scratchy,

406
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,216
a young boy--

407
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,013
a wonderful, irrepressible
young boy--

408
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,017
took it on his own
to solve the problem.

409
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,480
He discovered that the postal service's
"Mr. Zip" was just a rip-off

410
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:55,404
{\an8}of my father's stick figure
character "Manic Mailman."

411
00:19:55,485 --> 00:20:00,115
So the government gave me
a huge cash settlement

412
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,909
and Itchy & Scratchy Studios
is back in business.

413
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,164
(generator powering up)

414
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,205
Thanks to you, Lester.

415
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,793
-(both gasp)
-What the hell is going on?

416
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,208
I don't know,
but it looks like

417
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,007
you might have a little
competition all of a sudden.

418
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:21,181
Thanks, everybody, but I
couldn't have done all this

419
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:24,971
without the help of
my brainy sister Eliza.

420
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,727
(gasps)

421
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:30,518
I, too, owe many thanks
to Lester and Eliza.

422
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,734
This is a great vindication
for anybody

423
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,284
who was ever taking a bath,
went to get the paper,

424
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,279
fell down, and had the door
slam behind them

425
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,901
and the doorknob break off.

426
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,857
And I'd like to thank Lester

427
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,488
for reuniting me
with my estranged wife.

428
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,695
(applause)

429
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,656
-I never even heard about that.
-I don't understand it.

430
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,117
We're always the ones
who solve these problems.

431
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,458
(panting)

432
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,422
I guess you don't
need it now,

433
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,263
but we had a plan too.

434
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,508
Hey, great.
Listen, write it down

435
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,550
and mail it to last week
when I might have cared.

436
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,675
