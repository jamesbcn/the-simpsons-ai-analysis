Can you loosen my arms

I may be of help.

Where did you come from?

112
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,175
I’m your cell mate.

113
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,597
You never noticed me
because frankly,

114
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,555
you’re extremely
self-centered.

115
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,555
Oh, sorry,
I wasn’t listening.

116
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,067
I was checking out my reflection
in this yellow water.

117
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,899
Ho-ho-ho-ho,
looking good.

118
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,906

but now I can’t use it.

123
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,670
I’m simply too old.

124
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:52,829
And decrepit.

125
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,917
(shudders): But you can escape
and use this map

126
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,134
to retrieve
my buried treasure.

127
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,554
With it you can
have your revenge.

128
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,263
Ooh, the-the!

129
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,053
But why are
<i>you </i>helping me?

130
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,218
Well, because before
my wretched life

131
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,557
comes to a close,

132
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,891
I want to know that
I had one friend.

133
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,858
Also, because
while you slept,

134
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,568
I violated you repeatedly.

135
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,438
So this map leads
to a treasure, huh?

136
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,735

this tunnel

137
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:26,871

00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,334
I had to take revenge
on some of my contractors.

222

tell me what to do.

want to join us?

revenge is great,

to talk about it.

Although two of the ways
were kind of the same way,

484

might have worked better

485
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,660

497
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,685
Why do you think
it is that mankind
