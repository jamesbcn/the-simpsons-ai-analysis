{\an8}Because if there's one thing

{\an8}it's that the most powerful weapon
is knowledge.

Bart, I'm glad that you're trying,

161
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,645
but I am worried that
you're starting from a place

162

far behind most students.

163
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,356
It's because I am so troubled, ma'am.

164
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,407

I need a firm but pretty hand.

165
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,622
Oh. Would you like Martin Prince

166
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,003
No! Last time he was at my house,

167

he talked about bird-watching all day.

168
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,458
Even my mom got bored,
and she loves boredom.

169

00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,801

SKINNER: Uh, Ms. Berrera?
(clears throat)

178
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,663
I was, uh, wondering
if you needed any help,

179
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,077
uh, pulling your maps.

180
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,206
You have to give 'em a snap.

181
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,883
Otherwise,
they just get longer and longer.

182
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,304
<i>BART: Oh, my God, he loves her, too.</i>

183
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,053
<i>SKINNER: Oh, my God, he loves her, too.</i>

184
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,764
<i>HERRERA: (American accent)</i>
<i>Oh, my God, they love me, too!</i>

185
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,385
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>In my head, I sound like this.</i>

186
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:25,062
LISA: No! No, no, no, no!

187
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,647
BART:
What happened? Did jazz die?

188
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,402
Look at me!

189
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,239
Acne? But she's only eight.

190
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,451
Somehow I'm becoming
a squeaky-voiced teen!

191
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,743
(voice cracking)
Do you want fries with that?

192
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,287
What am I saying?!

193
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,670
BART: I, too, was visited
by the Ghost of Puberty Present.

194
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,128
I've got a starter 'stache.

195
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,128
Next, I'm a loser,
then I'm a creep, then I'm a perv.

196
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,551
I've got to buy a van.

197
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,299
(crying) This isn't fair.

198
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,512
I'm not ready for my awkward years.

199
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,353
This is my happy childhood,
for crying out loud!

200
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,270
Aw. Beep, bop, boop.

201
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,468
Dialing for pizza.

202
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,728
-(grunts)
-Ow!

203
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,483
Somewhere, another mustache
is in tremendous pain.

204
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,895
It must be precocious puberty.

205
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,453
It's a thing.
I just read about it in <i>Thing Magazine.</i>

206
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,870
Homer, I'll fix Lisa up,
and you teach Bart to shave.

207
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,750
You got it. But there will be blood.

208
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:27,077
And there, there, and there.

209
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:31,758
The cream looks delicious,
but don't eat too much.

210
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,799
And there.
See how it's done, boy?

211
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,763
Dad, aren't you supposed to take
the little plastic thing off the blade?

212
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,144
Really?
I always wondered about that.

213
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:41,968
Hmm.

214
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,678
(humming)

215
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,403
(gasps) Well, hello, Billy Zane.

216
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,860
(purrs)

217
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,569
Sweetie, every kid goes through this.

218
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,531
That's why proms are dark.

219
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:58,235
Just stick some carrots in there
three times a day.

220
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,913
So we won't see your sweet little face
for ten more years?

221
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,917
(crying)
Mom, the inside of this hoodie

222
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,051
is covered in tears.

223
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,924
Let me try some makeup.

224
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,416
(whimpering)

225
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,718
-Cruelty-free?
-Oh, yes.

226
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,852
I'll be very gentle.

227
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,849
Marge? Marge, you got to see this!

228
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,601
Oh, what is it?

229
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,603
D'oh!

230
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,783
I actually have two different PTSDs.

231
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,648
The kind we combat veterans know.

232
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,445
And also parent-teacher-student dilemmas.

233
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,448
No!

234
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,793
(squeaking, grunts)

235
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,368
(gasps) Bart!

236
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,003
Do not worry.

237
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,500
I am certified as a paramedic.

238
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,424
Oh! Teacher, could you kiss my owie?

239
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,676
Boy owies can only be kissed by Willie.

240
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,049
(panting)

241
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,556
-Where's the owie?
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

242
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,056
Whoa, Lisa, you look great!

243
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,102
Beautiful and mature.

244
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,225
Like a sideline reporter.

245
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,022
Oh. R-Really?

246
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,316
Didn't know you were so cool.

247
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,150
Well, um, uh, well, duh.

248
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,317
<i>LISA: Oh, my God, I'm popular!</i>

249
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,577
<i>Hope this doesn't go to my head.</i>

250
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,999
<i>It went right to my head! Aah!</i>

251
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,828
So when you're done with this page,

252
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,253
you will learn how tectonic plates

253
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:34,592
rub against each other
till something gives deep down.

254
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,090
-(laughs)
-You do not have to tutor this boy

255
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,513
under the new One Child Left Behind law.

256
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:43,262
But he needs help, and he's not
going to be a child much longer.

257
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,255
He's got a mustache coming in.

258
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,927
Yeah, so beat it, bald lip.

259
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,435
-(cell phone chimes)
-Oh, my God!

260
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,570
I just got invited
to my first third-grade party!

261
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,528
Are the parents gonna be home?

262
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,529
-Yes.
-(scoffs) Lame.

263
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,571
Guys, I need to sharpen my mustaches.

264
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:01,914
Which is better--

265
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,699
A or B?

266
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,583
A... or B?

267
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,079
A or B?

268
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,911
-A... or B?
-B.

269
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,167
-A.
-N.

270
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:15,288
Ugh! I'm tired of my son
having a mustache like a pool boy.

271
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:19,377
Hey, those pool boys
pull in some sweet jingle.

272
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,465
Plus, they get to work in flip-flops.

273
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,800
Homie, it's time we figured this out.

274
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,846
Maybe milk will help us think.

275
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,600
How would milk do that?

276
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,681
It's from cows who are smart enough

277
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,597
not to get turned into hamburger.

278
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,225
Hmm.

279
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,612
Oh.

280
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,108
I never looked closely
at this milk before.

281
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,031
Is it made by a soda company?

282
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,989
They don't just make soda, Marge.

283
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,780
They also make industrial foam.

284
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,123
(belches loudly)

285
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,040
Homer, it's the milk!

286
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,868
-Oh.
-Hey.

287
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,254
I'll call the help hotline on the carton.

288
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,997
(touch tones sounding)

289
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,844
(phone ringing)

290
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,839
Talk to me.

291
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,511
Yes, I need a milk refund.

292
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,129
Right. Um, address, please?

293
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,257
Wait, wait. Hold on.

294
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:09,064
742 Nevergreen...

295
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,019
Oh, Evergreen Terrace.

296
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,520
Sorry. Our system's a little slow.

297
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,272
(indistinct chatter)

298
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,194
(whistling)

299
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,817
-Aw!
-(both moaning)

300
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,451
Ew! I mean, cool!

301
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,292
I just turned a big corner, Bart.

302
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,670
(humming)

303
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,629
(laughing) Oh, Simpson,

304
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,710
I called you here to gloat.

305
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,625
(scoffs) Yeah, yeah,
I know about you and Berrera.

306
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,875
You know about me and Carol?

307
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,927
(gasps) You know her name?

308
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,051
Oh, first and middle, and I know more.

309
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,968
Her favorite salad bar item
is little shredded cheese.

310
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,517
(scoffs) Everyone likes that.

311
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,271
Oh, I know a lot more than that.

312
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,482
She's never seen an episode of <i>Friends.</i>

313
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,653
-Not even "The One With..."
-No, not one.

314
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,322
And she has a cat
with different color eyes.

315
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,611
His name is Bowie.

316
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,605
No!

317
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,327
Face it, Simpson,
you can't compete with me.

318
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,038
I can rent a car.

319
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,043
How can I derail his happiness?

320
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,882
I got a delivery of live class pets here.

321
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,918
Interesting. Excuse me.

322
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,802
-I have one question.
-Yes.

323
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:26,129
When you're in the shower,
do you shampoo your mustache?

324
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,336
Of course. It's a must-stache,

325
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,547
not an if-you-feel-like-it-stache.

326
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,058
All right, have a good day.
Dickory doo.

327
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,230
(both moaning)

328
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,100
I brought you some candy, Carol.

329
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,357
Not from CVS, not from Walgreens.

330
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,019
From the airport.

331
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,607
And I wasn't even going anywhere.

332
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,444
-Oh!
-Ah.

333
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,697
Your candy's filled with chupacabras.

334
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,780
We've been pranked or possibly punked.

335
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,826
I know who your prankster is.

336
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,500
The Simpson lad.

337
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,408
Were you watching us make out?

338
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,957
I was watching you try.

339
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,003
Mom, could you please, please,

340
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,167
please stay within the lip liner?

341
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,836
A week ago,
you'd never even worn makeup.

342
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,296
Now you're an expert like Ace Frehley.

343
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,717
(groans)

344
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,436
Sherri. Terri. (laughs)

345
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:25,322
I usually don't see double
until an hour into the party. (giggles)

346
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,241
(thunder rumbling)

347
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,449
<i>LISA: It's going to rain,</i>
<i>and rain washes off makeup,</i>

348
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,661
<i>and then they will see me as I truly am--</i>

349
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,541
<i>imperfect, blemished,</i>

350
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,748
<i>a social mess in a lampshade dress.</i>

351
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,619
(thunderclaps)

352
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,246
<i>Okay, all right.</i>

353
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,922
<i>Lisa, you were never popular,</i>

354
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,001
<i>so you're playing with</i>
<i>the house's money.</i>

355
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,256
Attention, party!

356
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,924
I'm not like you.

357
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,928
What I'm saying is,
I gave my Christmas money to NPR.

358
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,472
I have a chemistry set... that I've used!

359
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,766
MAN: Is there a point to this?

360
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,599
And beneath all this makeup,

361
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,104
I have... problem skin.

362
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,186
KIDS: Ew!

363
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,697
What are you talking about?
Your skin is fine.

364
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,358
Really? The bad milk wore off.

365
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,528
So, uh, admitting you're not cool

366
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,536
is probably the coolest thing
you can do, right? (laughs)

367
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,119
(kids murmuring)

368
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,504
I will see myself out.

369
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,209
(groans)

370
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,800
You look ba-lonely.

371
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,380
I feel ba-lonely.

372
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,675
-You want to be friends?
-I do.

373
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,719
Um, how clean is that hand?

374
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,512
Mmm... mah!

375
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,966
Cleaner now.

376
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,306
Okay.

377
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,600
A fish says, "Moo!"

378
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,734
(quietly) This isn't gonna last long.

379
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,691
I still take baths in the sink.

380
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,022
Okay, it's over. Sorry, Ralph.

381
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,778
I'll be eating crayons for one.

382
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,873
Oh, the plan is perfect!

383
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,751
I just have to get Skinner to hold still

384
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,788
while I slip a firecracker in his butt.

385
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,332
LISA: Come on, give it up.

386
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,745
Bart, I realized what's been going on.

387
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,674
We've been operating
under the influence of hormones.

388
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,134
Hormones? Sounds far-fetched.

389
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,665
(in deep voice) Very far-fetched.

390
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,338
Well, it's true, so give Skinner a shot.

391
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,387
Everyone deserves happiness.

392
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,471
Even wieners.

393
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,555
Hey, Dad, how much does
the Mustache Fairy pay?

394
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,647
Hmm, three bucks.

395
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:36,738
When you asked me to go skating,
I really thought you knew how.

396
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:41,454
Uh, I thought I could learn
by watching YouTubes this morning.

397
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,367
All right, Simpson, I'm here.

398
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,915
Do what you do best-- your worst.

399
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,879
Look, Seymour, I'm not gonna do a thing.

400
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,210
Carol, he's all yours.

401
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,548
Wow. The first war I've won.

402
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,761
Uh, Carol, all that's left is for you
to meet my mother,

403
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,142
and, uh, up she skates now.

404
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,643
My son, I just want to say,

405
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,811
I wish the four of you the best.

406
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,180
Four of us?

407
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,727
You, her,

408
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,480
your model planes and nudie books.

409
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,113
Sorry, Seymour.

410
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,109
Now I can't look at you
without picturing it.

411
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,942
Oh, my room's not that bad.

412
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,947
I'm talking about your mother.

413
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:19,159
(cackling)

414
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,951
Hey, listen, want to roast marshmallows?

415
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,405
-I'd like that.
-Great, man, great.

416
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,706
You're buying.

417
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,040
(saxophone playing)

418
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,880
Thank you, Simpson.

419
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,552
That does feel better.

420
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,090
Fire looks like it's dying down.

421
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,218
BART: Thanks, man.

422
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,434
Well, I guess a lot of women
leave their men

423
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,184
to go back and serve in Afghanistan.

424
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,766
No one drives 'em away like you, Seymour.

425
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,025
{\an8}(saxophone playing)

426
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,364
Well, no more makeup for me. Ever!

427
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,367
What about when you're blowing
your stupid horn at Carnegie Hall?

428
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,910
(gasps) If you say it out loud,
it won't come true!

429
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,865
Carnegie Hall. Carnegie Hall.
Carnegie Hall.

430
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,075
(both grunting)

431
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,384
Looks like someone's
still drinking the milk.

432
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,633
(both grunting)

433
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,255
{\an8}(saxophone playing)

434
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,559
{\an8}(jazz playing)

435
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,144
-(crowd murmuring)
-Shh!
