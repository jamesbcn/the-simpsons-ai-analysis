00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,721
I'd like that.

349
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,647
Nelson?

350
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,721
Papa!

351
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,685
You came back!

I never meant to
leave you, Nelson.

354
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,962
But something awful happened
when I went to the store.

355
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,247
Well, that explains a lot.
Who's hungry?

356
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,322
No. I want to hear
what happened at the store.

357
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,921
Well, I went in
to buy cigarettes.

358
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,042
Can you gift
wrap them, please?
They're for my son.

myself a candy bar.</i>

And that's where I found him.</i>

367
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,922
I brought him back here
so he could take Nelson away

368
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,048
and my bruises would heal.

369
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,760
I want to give you
a home again, son.

MRS. MUNTZ:
And so do I.

Mom!

372
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,966
I got an acting job

from the third
director I slept with.

374
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,725

worked out so well.

Thanks for
finding my dad, Bart.

And thanks, lady,
for making me feel
good about myself.

382

So now that
you're happy again,

383
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,886
I guess you won't beat me up
at school anymore.

384

I wish it were
that simple.
I really do.

385

They're a family again,
and so are we.

386
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,040
What happened?

387
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,681
Hmm. Sometimes you have
to adopt your son's bully

388
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,885
in order to bring your
own family temporarily closer.

what have you learned?

Nothing.

I still have an

the problem is the

a solution, right?

00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,324
I guess. But there's
a long way to go.
