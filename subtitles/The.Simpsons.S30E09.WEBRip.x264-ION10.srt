1
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,232
D'oh!

2
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,224
Sorry, no room.

3
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,402
I am a broccoli,
I help keep you lean.

4
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:11,372
My head's on a stalk,
and my color is...

5
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,308
is...

6
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,079
is...

7
00:01:19,113 --> 00:01:21,048
Oh, come on,
you little nitwit.

8
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,117
It's the color of your costume,
for God's sake.

9
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:24,552
Purple.

10
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,587
Get off my stage,
out of my sight.

11
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,989
- And into your parents' car.
- Okay.

12
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,091
You'll never work in
second grade theater again.

13
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,826
Hooray!

14
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:38,432
Up next, the heartwarming
story of the origin of veal.

15
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:45,673
Hello, friend-o.

16
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,980
No, no! You promised
you would cut this scene.

17
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:57,117
No, no, I cut your scene
because you were such a noodge.

18
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,820
Forget it. Show's over!

19
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,124
Fine.

20
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:07,495
Can I please get back
my after-show cupcakes?

21
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:10,964
- We already ate them.
- No!

22
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,167
Oh, I broke the cardinal rule,

23
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:15,436
never invest
in your own production.

24
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,871
But I'm gonna take back
my duct tape!

25
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,110
And my bulbs...
Hot, hot, hot.

26
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:27,080
Am I acting? No.

27
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:32,019
I'm stuck
in my pork chop suit.

28
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:34,322
I've become everything
I hate.

29
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:39,193
Huh? Oh, you were
the best one, sweetie.

30
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:42,463
Wha...? I didn't even
get to do my line.

31
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,199
Oh, I think I'm gonna cry.

32
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:50,170
Oh, no.
I hate to see a pork chop cry.

33
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:06,153
Green! Green. Green. Green.

34
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,323
Too late now, boy.
Just play with the siren.

35
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:18,999
76. 82. 79.

36
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,369
Homer, that's the weather.

37
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:23,437
D'oh!

38
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:26,940
Homer, I want you
to do something with Lisa.

39
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:28,709
I am.

40
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:31,445
Isn't that right, honey?

41
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,748
You're not speaking to her
or even making eye contact.

42
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,717
Oh, you'd be surprised
at the things

43
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,352
my eyes are in contact with.

44
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:41,355
Okay. Well, what is she doing
right now?

45
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,024
She's riding her pony?

46
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,260
Blowing her clarinet?

47
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:49,029
Protesting a whale.

48
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,365
I'm reading
To Kill a Mockingbird.

49
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:55,903
Now just remember, it's set
in the South a long time ago.

50
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:58,306
The terrible racism
you're reading about

51
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:01,174
is now everywhere.

52
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,945
We're gonna shop at all
the stores you like

53
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,815
that have a chair I can sit in,
except the chair store.

54
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,383
I'm not allowed back there.

55
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:12,586
Kent Brockman here interviewing
three blue-collar men

56
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,988
who voted for Trump.
How do you feel now?

57
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:18,091
- Please stop interviewing us.
- Never.

58
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,126
Here's the store.

59
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,261
Let's get something sweet
for my little girl.

60
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:24,465
Sugar and spice and
everything... What the?!

61
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,066
Twerking Girl?

62
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,969
Ho, Sweet Ho?
Baby's First Thong?

63
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,238
Those are just a few
of our high-end brands.

64
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,074
We also have Call of Booty,
Raggedy Anorexic,

65
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,010
The Edge of 13, and, for boys,
Jack the Stripper.

66
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,812
Oh, for crying out loud.

67
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:42,149
Okay, that's it. I've heard
enough and three past that.

68
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:45,419
My daughter is still
a sweet little girl.

69
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:48,956
What the? Oh, come on!

70
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:53,026
My daughter's not a sex object.
She's a respect object.

71
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,432
Innocent girls.

72
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,136
Knee socks.

73
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:07,140
Grow up too fast.

74
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,280
I will see you all in court.

75
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,654
Dad, I'm seeing you
through new eyes.

76
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:22,890
You've become
the hero of my book.

77
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,191
The guy who kills the
mockingbird?

78
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,126
No one kills a mockingbird.

79
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,495
Spoiler alert.

80
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,062
You're like Atticus Finch,

81
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:32,833
a modest, heroic man
who stands up for what's right.

82
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,134
Yeah, sure.

83
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,505
And I love the way
you just made me feel safer.

84
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,640
She respects me.

85
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,709
This is even better
than the time the Milk Duds

86
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:45,045
in the vending machine knocked
down a 3 Musketeers bar too.

87
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:48,749
Man beats machine!

88
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,686
Well, I think
that's all the reading

89
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,187
for tonight, honey.
It's getting late.

90
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,989
What time is it?

91
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,191
8:30.

92
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,960
May I see your watch?

93
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,371
To Atticus,
My Beloved Husband.

94
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:14,808
Oh, black and white?
The TV's broken.

95
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,513
Hey, we were watching that.

96
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:22,182
Why, look, it's Bart Simpson

97
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,185
in his short pants
on the davenport.

98
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,386
Are you nuts?

99
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,388
Homer is my hero.

100
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:29,957
Say it in American.

101
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,559
He stood up for me.

102
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,226
It was magnificent.

103
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,030
- I wish my dad was a hero.
- Wish granted, son!

104
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,298
Now let's move it.

105
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:42,035
If I hand out 5,000 flyers,
I get all the turkey shreds

106
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,271
I can dig out
of the slicer trap.

107
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:47,374
And dig I will.

108
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,109
Well, I don't care
if Dad's your hero.

109
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,979
You know whose hero I am?
Maggie's. Come here, girl.

110
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:59,152
Okay, the dog's your hero,
but I'm your human hero.

111
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,153
Fine.

112
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:02,122
But I'm your living human hero.

113
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,825
Are you saying I'm dead?
Put up your dukes.

114
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:08,095
Now put up my dukes.

115
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:11,231
Now take down your dukes.

116
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,834
I'm the greatest!

117
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,169
Oh, someone put down my dukes.

118
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:34,287
I'd always liked my dad,

119
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:37,090
but this was something new
and wonderful.

120
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,458
I admired him.

121
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:41,695
The way he'd take me to
the science museum once a year.

122
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:44,832
D'oh!

123
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:47,868
D'oh!

124
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,474
And now we get ice cream.

125
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,479
Oh, sweetie,
it's starting to melt.

126
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:02,282
Daddy will give you
a little help.

127
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,184
A little more help.

128
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,554
A little more. A little more.

129
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,057
Oh, Daddy ate yours.
You can have mine.

130
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,125
- Thank you.
- Now let Daddy...

131
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,594
I got it.

132
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,999
And he inspired me in school.

133
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,467
The second grade was grim,

134
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,736
but Jem assured me
that the older I get,

135
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,304
the better school would be.

136
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,140
Who says my class is grim?
Who's Jem?

137
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,676
What are you talking about?

138
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,544
That's from
To Kill a Mockingbird.

139
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:33,547
Page 67. The book
you assigned us to read.

140
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:36,216
I assigned you to read
the Wikipedia article.

141
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:41,221
But my brother
was not so happy.

142
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,192
Mom, why can't we be
like that?

143
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,262
Well...

144
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:54,902
I taste blue.

145
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,904
Yeah, okay.

146
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:03,010
I tell you, guys,
having a kid that likes you

147
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,178
is the greatest feeling
in the world.

148
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,947
I never got along
with my old man.

149
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,849
He was always disappointed
I didn't follow him

150
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,117
in the family business.

151
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,686
- What did he do?
- He was editor of Life magazine.

152
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,956
- I thought that was defunct.
- He keeps saying a real son

153
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,224
would've bought it
out of bankruptcy

154
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,059
and launched it
as a digital platform.

155
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:22,062
Well, angel funders
want too much equity.

156
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:25,065
Sorry, Dad.

157
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:28,435
Yeah, my dad left
when I was most vulnerable,

158
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:31,972
the day after Mom left.
That was a tough week there.

159
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:39,379
Not a good time
to film a commercial.

160
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,248
Don't worry,
we'll take these cameras

161
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:44,051
and we'll make
a Netflix documentary.

162
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,955
They will buy anything!

163
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:08,909
For dessert,
I made blackberry pie.

164
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,012
Oh, I made Dad a blueberry pie.

165
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,514
Oh, what to do, what to do?

166
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:18,518
In the words of King Solomon,
I shall eat two pies.

167
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,088
I don't think King Solomon
said that.

168
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,956
Maybe it was a king salmon.

169
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,860
The point is, pies are good.

170
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:32,165
Homer, I think Bart could use
a little attention.

171
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:34,802
Give attention to Lisa,
give attention to Bart.

172
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,037
What am I, made of attention?

173
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,443
Okay, because of
budget cutbacks,

174
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,878
you got 45 seconds each.

175
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:47,014
40 after the explanation.
You, get in!

176
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,281
What you're experiencing
is a phenomenon

177
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,883
known as transference,
where you project your feelings

178
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,151
towards your mother
onto your art teacher.

179
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,353
Anytime you find yourself
wanting to hug Mrs. Hakamuchi,

180
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,622
snap this rubber band
on your wrist.

181
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,690
Next!

182
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,627
What are you waiting for?
I'm here for an hour,

183
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,895
then I'm off to
14 other schools.

184
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:03,330
I eat lunch in my car
'cause they won't let me

185
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,898
counsel kids with food
in my mouth.

186
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:06,700
Well, I always thought
my dad was a big fat loser

187
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:08,836
until he started giving
attention to my lame-o sister.

188
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,403
So why do I want
his attention now?

189
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:11,671
Why does this hurt?

190
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:12,973
Family members are
locked into roles.

191
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,041
Change that,
and what do you get?

192
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,175
Resentment and acting out.

193
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,043
Acting out can take many forms,

194
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:17,244
from pouting to armed robbery.

195
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,478
- Time's almost up.
- So, what do I do?

196
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,713
You have no choice.

197
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:21,248
Act out until somebody
pays attention to you.

198
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,083
Next!

199
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,218
Okay, couples therapy.
You got 90 seconds.

200
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:28,121
I'm the oldest,
and she won't admit it.

201
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:32,259
Milhouse,
I'm about to act out.

202
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:35,262
After we leave an envelope
full of guilt.

203
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,831
Also, we're stopping by
the photo booth.

204
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,233
- And the perfume room.
- Enough.

205
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:52,112
Come on, sweetie,
pick up the pace.

206
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,214
The sushi's been sitting out
for an hour.

207
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:58,118
When Willie turned 13, it was
time to work in the mines.

208
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,552
It's go time.

209
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:04,291
Help. My friend's having
an asthma attack.

210
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:07,795
Not yet, Bart.
This is a real one.

211
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,229
Even better.

212
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:14,101
Please, we've got to get him
to the hospital.

213
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,938
I'm gonna meet a nurse.

214
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:29,316
And now we're gonna party
like it's 5799.

215
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,151
Wait, wait, wait.

216
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:34,487
Before you leave,
I am going to talk.

217
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:37,958
And I'm going to tell you
a very long joke.

218
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,793
Please stand.

219
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:44,965
So, an old rabbi was
confronted with squirrels

220
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,299
in the attic.

221
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,969
Get to the punch line
or your son flunks geometry.

222
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,303
He gave the squirrels
a bar mitzvah

223
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:51,404
and never saw them
in temple again.

224
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,772
Amen.

225
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:59,179
I don't drive a minivan.

226
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:02,482
Do I look like a suburban
soccer mom from Phoenix?

227
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,918
Well, sometimes,
when you're tired.

228
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:06,854
- Shut up!
- I should be first.

229
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:07,855
I own a Tesla.

230
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,256
Those are my keys.

231
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,458
Prepare for the boning
of your life.

232
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:20,200
To repeat, I own a Tesla,
and I'm going to use summon.

233
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:28,808
Who is responsible
for this meshugana behavior?

234
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:31,144
He did it.

235
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,799
Hey, Mr. Cunningham.

236
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,002
I said hey, Mr. Cunningham.

237
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,636
I didn't do it.
Nobody saw me do it.

238
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,072
They know I did it.
Protect me, Dad.

239
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:02,075
Don't you remember me,
Mr. Cunningham?

240
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,743
I'm Jean Louise Finch.

241
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:12,652
Where's your boy?

242
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,487
What's your hurry, friend?

243
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,724
Now, Homer, don't you try
to disarm us

244
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:21,995
with your genteel mannerisms
of a bygone era there.

245
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:27,100
Why, I haven't a notion as to what
you are importuning, good sir.

246
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,514
Excuse me, Mr. Szyslak.

247
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,251
Mr. Szyslak, we know you.

248
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:47,087
My father likes to drink
at your bar.

249
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,456
You can't say hi to me?

250
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:53,260
And how 'bout you,
Chief Wiggum?

251
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,595
I go to school
with your boy, Ralph.

252
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:59,099
Give my regards to Ralph,
would you, please?

253
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,434
All right, let's go, people.
They've defused us.

254
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:04,071
Everyone get...
get one last mutter in.

255
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,044
Oh, Lisa, sweetie, you saved me.

256
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:13,213
No, Dad, you saved us all

257
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,382
with your calmness and bravery.

258
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,985
- Thanks. Just one thing.
- Yes, Dad?

259
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,819
Don't tell your mother
about the mob

260
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,054
that almost killed your brother.

261
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:23,090
She's taken a liking to him.

262
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,224
The what?

263
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,060
You're hearing things
in the shower again, Marge.

264
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,762
Oh, okay.

265
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:30,863
Sorry.

266
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:40,974
Okay, Maggie,
you give me your binky,

267
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:45,112
and I'll give you this
substitution bear doll.

268
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,018
You can't beat addiction, Marge.

269
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,186
I got addicted
to Agatha Christie books.

270
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,157
I always thought the murderer
was that know-it-all Belgian.

271
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,526
Turns out, he was the detective.

272
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,929
41 books, and I never
saw it coming.

273
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,300
- What happened?
- Got in a fight.

274
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,502
Why?
What did the other kid do?

275
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:12,105
Said Dad was lazy
and incompetent.

276
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,706
And where is this other kid?

277
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,974
Yo.

278
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,843
You got in a fight
with your brother?

279
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:18,678
I won a fight with my brother.

280
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,213
- Liar.
- Let's go again.

281
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,182
Stop her, Mom.

282
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,219
To combat bed-wetting,
doctors recommend

283
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:27,720
shifting times for drinking,
scheduling bathroom breaks,

284
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:30,057
and being encouraging.
I'll deny having said this,

285
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,524
but the next time you wet
your bed, have 'em spank you.

286
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:34,127
Next.

287
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,695
Wait, you're not a kid.
Doesn't matter.

288
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,164
You've got 45 seconds.
Go.

289
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,632
I'm worried that my daughter
is ruining her family

290
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,701
idolizing her father.

291
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,670
I see.
Marge, it's totally normal

292
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,472
for a little girl to be
infatuated with her father.

293
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,174
It's safe and comes
from a good place,

294
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,875
and when it ends, it's another
thing she'll blame you for.

295
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:51,644
Yes, well, I'm afraid
my husband isn't always

296
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,147
a perfect influence.

297
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:57,084
Marge, I've got a legal matter
to deal with.

298
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,052
I'll be outside.

299
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:04,157
Also, I'm worried that my son
is feeling neglected.

300
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,592
Your husband has to give your
daughter the perfect speech,

301
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,660
which lets her down
but doesn't snap her in two.

302
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,028
And make sure you don't
have any more kids.

303
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:11,264
Sounds like it'll be a disaster.

304
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:14,101
Whoa, nice to meet you.
See you in three years.

305
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,034
Now, good-bye.

306
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,574
- Homer?
- What?

307
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:24,177
Homer, it's sweet that
Lisa idolizes you,

308
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,513
but I think it's gone too far.

309
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,047
You're right.

310
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:29,216
Tell her she's right.

311
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,417
I just did.

312
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,519
I'm on a five-second delay.

313
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,721
The kids are at
each other's throats.

314
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:38,125
Look, you can't be my dog
and hers, pick a side.

315
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:41,761
You can't hide in there forever.

316
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,966
Okay, I'll talk to Bart,
you talk to Lisa.

317
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,102
We've got to put this family
back in place.

318
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:51,538
Okay. Why do you
always tell me

319
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,041
the most important things just
when I'm about to fall asleep?

320
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,478
Because I think the pillow talk
between a woman and her husband

321
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:01,914
is the most important...

322
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,983
What? How did I
wind up in church?

323
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:08,455
What's wrong, sweetie?

324
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:10,990
I've got that terrible feeling
where I'm almost

325
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,459
at the end of a great book,

326
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:15,662
and once I finish,
it's over forever.

327
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:18,265
Well, that's kind of what
I wanted to talk to you about.

328
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:21,601
You and I have had a lot of fun
these past few weeks,

329
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,736
but you aren't always gonna
look up to your dad

330
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,104
as much as you do now.

331
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:26,906
Bup, bup, bup.
Great man,

332
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,942
there is nothing you could do
to make me lose one iota

333
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:32,179
of respect for you.

334
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:38,585
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be that guy,

335
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,920
but now I can't fit
behind a door.

336
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,090
You'll discover I'm not
the perfect man you think.

337
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,025
Okay, I'll finish my book.

338
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,628
But always remember
you're my dad,

339
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:51,831
and I'll never forget
the way you and...

340
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,202
Damn it.

341
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,506
I'm home!

342
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:03,142
She's moved on,

343
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:05,812
which, let's face it,
is the way things should be.

344
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,814
Kids grow up, daddies die,

345
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,982
and then the wind
whispers, why?

346
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:14,387
Oh, I don't know.
I've been hurt before.

347
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:17,023
I don't want to mess you up
by getting close to you.

348
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,869
No problem.

349
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,170
Marge, get in here.

350
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,076
Okay, Bart, because
we treasure you too,

351
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:40,179
I'm gonna let you do one thing
just for yourself.

352
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,681
Kick Homer in the butt?

353
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:45,084
Why don't you give it
some thought.

354
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,152
Kick Lisa in the butt.

355
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,754
Have a birthday party every day?

356
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,722
Never brush my teeth again.

357
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:51,258
Be homeschooled by the dog.

358
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,092
Drive a tank through
Skinner's house.

359
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,994
Open a casino in the basement.

360
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,162
Have an affair?

361
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,098
- You haven't decided yet?
- Don't rush me.

362
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,668
Convert my Roth IRA to a 401K?

363
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,935
Have an affair?

364
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,103
Take a mulligan?

365
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,572
Okay, I've decided.

366
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:08,174
I'll kick Homer in the butt.

367
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:12,245
You can kick it
if you can find it.

368
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,846
D'oh.

369
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,014
<i>Well, they say</i>

370
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:19,018
<i>Time loves a hero</i>

371
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,421
<i>But only time will tell</i>

372
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,423
<i>If he's real</i>

373
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:25,425
<i>He's a legend from heaven</i>

374
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,427
<i>If he ain't,
he was sent here from hell ♪</i>

375
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,429
<i>Hear me well</i>

376
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:32,432
<i>Seein' ain't
always believin'</i>

377
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:35,802
<i>Just make sure it's the truth
that you're seein'</i>

378
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:40,407
<i>Eyes sometimes lie,
eyes sometimes lie</i>

379
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,748
<i>They can be real deceivin'</i>
