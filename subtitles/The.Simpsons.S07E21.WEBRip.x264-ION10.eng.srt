180
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,952
Well, Seymour, I made it,
despite your directions.

181
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,700
Ah, Superintendent
Chalmers, welcome.

182
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,492
I hope you're prepared for
an unforgettable luncheon.

183
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,656
Yeah.

184
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,497

185
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,421

186
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,000
My roast is ruined.

187
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,955
But what if...

188
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,796
I were to purchase fast food

189
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,841
and disguise it
as my own cooking?

190
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:33,466
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.
Delightfully devilish, Seymour.

Superintendent!
I was just...

197
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,948
uh, stretching my calves
on the windowsill.

198
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,995
Isometric exercise--
care to join me?

199
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,579
Why is there smoke coming out
of your oven, Seymour?

200
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,245
Uh... oh! That isn't smoke.

201
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,133
It's steam.

202
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,250
Steam from the steamed clams
we're having.

203
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,707
Mmm, steamed clams.

204
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,679
Whoo.

205
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,473
Superintendent,
I hope you're ready

206
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,885
for mouth-watering
hamburgers.

207
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,643
I thought we were having
steamed clams.

208
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,055
Oh, no, I said
"steamed hams."

209
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,904
That's what I
call hamburgers.

210
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,480
You call hamburgers
"steamed hams"?

211
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,646
Yes, it's a regional dialect.

212
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,574
Uh-huh. What region?

213
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,283
Uh... upstate New York.

214
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,453
Really? Well, I'm from Utica,

215
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,542
and I've never heard anyone use
the phrase "steamed hams."

216
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,998
Oh, not in Utica, no,
it's an Albany expression.

217
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:40,959
I see.

218
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,380
You know, these hamburgers
are quite similar

219
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,498
to the ones they have
at Krusty Burger.

220
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,626
(laughing)
Oh, no.

221
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,593
Patented Skinner burgers,
old family recipe.

222
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,974
-For steamed hams.
-Yes.

223
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,762
Yes, and you call them
steamed hams

224
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,426
despite the fact they are
obviously grilled.

225
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,765
Y-You know th--

226
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,652
One thing I sh--

227
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,520
Excuse me for one second.

228
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,727
Of course.

229
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,939
Ah, well,
that was wonderful.

230
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,028
Good time was had by all.
I'm pooped.

231
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,703
Yes, I should be--

232
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,741
Good Lord! What is
happening in there?

233
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,285
Aurora borealis.

234
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,948
Aurora borealis?!

235
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,668
At this time of year,
at this time of day,

236
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,419
in this part of the country,

237
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,300
localized entirely
within your kitchen?

238
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,208
-Yes.
-May I see it?

239
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,968
No.

SKINNER'S MOTHER:
Seymour, the house is on fire!

241
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,471
No, Mother, it's just
the Northern Lights.

242
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,885
Well, Seymour,
you are an odd fellow,

243
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,314
but I must say,
you steam a good ham.

244
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:51,645

at the railroad tracks?

253
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,512
Better get some change.

254
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,103

269
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,417

270
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,836
D'oh, bad dog.

Don't worry, Maggie.

275
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,560
I'll think of something.

You know,
I went to the McDonald's

281
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,737
in, uh, Shelbyville
on Friday night.

282
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,945
The Mc-what?

283
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,084
Uh, McDonald's restaurant.

284
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,831
I never heard
of it either

285
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,462
but, uh, they have over
2,000 locations

286
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,669

287
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,209

overnight.

288
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,922
You know the funniest thing,
though?

289
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,252
It's the little differences.

290
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,166
-Example.
-Well, at McDonald's,

291
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,465
you can buy a Krusty Burger
with cheese, right?

292
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,429
But they don't call it
a Krusty Burger with cheese.

293
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,429
Get out! What do they call it?

294
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,971
A Quarter Pounder with cheese.

295
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,064
Quarter Pounder with cheese?

296
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,020
Well, I can picture the cheese,
but, uh, do they have

297
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,811
Krusty partially gelatinated,
nondairy, gum-based beverages?

298
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,397
Mm-hmm. They
call them shakes.

299
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,322
Huh, shakes.

300
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,820
You don't know
what you're getting.

301
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,362

some donuts.

Good boy.

360
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,129
Do your dirty, sinful business.

361
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,089
Well, howdy,

363
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,512

364

Oh, uh, ooh... bad dog.

366

Look at that.
Right on Ned's lawn.

367
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,471
Now, how could you
do such a thing?

368
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,676
(quietly)
Good boy. Don't stop now.

369
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,226
Bad dog!
I condemn you to hell.

370
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,600
Better get
the ol' snow shovel

371
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,556
back from Homer, huh?

372
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,647
Good boy.

373
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,521
Don't stop the music.

374
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,236
Marge Simpson,

375
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,820
still making juice
the old-fashioned way?

376
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,235
No, I've got gum in my hair.

377
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,994
Oh, we've tried everything--

378
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,746
olive oil, lemon juice,
tartar sauce, chocolate syrup,

379
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,458
gravy, bacon fat,
hummus and baba ganoush.

380
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,999
My scalp hurts
from horsefly bites.

381
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,794
Why don't you freeze it
with an ice cube,

382
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,917
and hit it with a hammer?

383
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:03,963
Works for me when I get
bubbly-gum

384
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,006
in the ol' push broom.

385
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,259
That sounds okay.

386
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,380
Ah!

387
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,046
Ah!

388
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,224

Hmm...

390
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,176
I seem to have
mashed more hair into it.

391
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,103
Oh, well.

392
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,812
Ice cubes
are useless, man.

393
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,942
Chewing gum's got
to be chewed out.

394
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,769
Does the whole town
have to hear about this?

395
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:24,364
Gar, have ye tried
a Baltic squid?

396
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,651
They can suck the bolts
out of a submarine's hull.

397
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,276
All right.

398
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,203
Fangoria will give me
25 bucks for this shot.

399
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,872
I can give you the name
of a good gum-and-hair man.

401
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,865
I have a word of advice:

402
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,245
don't try to dig gum out
with a bone.

403
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,172
It just makes things worse.

404
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,001
Leave it in as evidence.

405
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,416
Bazooka Joe's got deep pockets.

406
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,384
Perhaps I can help.

407
