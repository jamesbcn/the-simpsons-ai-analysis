1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,440
Oh, man, I can't
believe we have

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,980
to pick the peaches
ourselves.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,550
This activity is so lame I'm
gonna daydream about school.

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,950
Damn it, a pop quiz!

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,890
Aw, come on, Bart, it's fun!

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,230
Well, that was kind of the same
as the first time.

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,660
Oh! Why did I suggest this?

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,860
Peach pickin' ain't so bad,
long as you got

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,600
a song to take
your mind off it.

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,170
Ooh, authentic
American folk music,

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,370
just like they play on NPR!

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,510
I'm afraid the only "NPR"

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,580
we know down here is
National Public Radio.

Marge, how much do they pay us
for doing this?

29
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,480
Actually, we pay them for each
peach we take home.

30
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,880
What the...?

31
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,760
First I work, then I pay,
then I have to eat fruit?!

32
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
Why was I ever born?!

33
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,840
Ha-ha!

34
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,650
Okay, we've got peach bruschetta
on peach toast,

35
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,480
peach-aroni peach-za

36
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,920
and my famous BLTs--
or should I say, PPPs?

37
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,360
Come on, people, peaches!

38
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,930
Uh, honey, on a non-stone
fruit-related topic,

39
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,330
I booked us a
couples massage.

40
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,260
Ooh... couples!

41
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,830
That way I can enjoy
my massage,

42
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,400
and make sure you don't enjoy
yours too much.

43
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,810
Initiate phase two.

44
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,310
I forget what phase two is,

45
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,780
but I'll assume we just dump
the peaches like we discussed.

46
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,880
Affirmative.

47
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,050
I'll assume that means "yes."

48
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,220
Roger.

49
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,220
The name's Bart.

50
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,700
Oh... mmm...

51
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,710
When we get home,
the peaches will be gone.

52
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,870
What?! What?!
What will we eat?!

53
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,240
Oh... Oh!

54
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,280
Oh, screw it.

55
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,410
Masseuses... the half-doctors half-hookers

56
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,750
who solve everything.

57
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,150
Oh! What idiot put the dump so
far away from where people live?

58
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,190
Aw, man!

59
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,430
The Horticulture Society is
having its Chinese Lantern party

60
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,900
and we've got nothing to huck!

61
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,900
Gentlemen, I think I have
the solution to your problem.

62
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,680
Where am I?
This neighborhood is starting

63
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,680
to look a little bit like
Sesame Street!

64
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,280
Wonder who's in there.

65
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,880
Could it be Oscar the...

66
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,660
Huh?

67
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,850
What the...?

68
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,710
Is somebody in here?

69
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,090
Help! I'm trapped in
an alternate dimension--

70
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,330
an existential
nether space! I...

71
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,030
Hey, how ya doin'?

72
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,590
All right, who sent you--
Marvin The Magician?

73
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,040
Oswald of the Occult?

74
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,480
Citywide Mortgage?

75
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,140
I worked everything out
with Nina.

76
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,550
No one sent me.

77
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,050
I just knocked on the
door and it opened.

78
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,980
Uh, how'd I get from inside
there to over here?

79
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,950
Because this
is a house of magic.

80
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,990
Sounds like most of the house is
still owned by the bank.

81
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,290
But the rest of it is magic.
Ooh...

82
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,970
How did you do all that?

83
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,070
Permit me
to introduce myself.

84
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,110
I am...
the Great Raymondo!

85
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,580
I was once the most famous
illusionist in the world,

86
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,940
performing for pashas
and potentates,

87
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,850
Grand Dukes
and Grande Dames...

88
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,020
Who wants to hear
an old man go on

89
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,890
about bygone wonders?

90
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,990
I do, I do!

91
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,790
Very well.

92
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,530
But first, you should
call your parents.

93
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,330
I got this phone
for subscribing

94
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,560
to <i>Psychic Monthly,</i>

95
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,660
and then I cancelled
the subscription.

96
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,900
They never saw it coming.

97
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,370
Meet Ali Rudy Vallée,
my musical automaton.

98
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,910
He can play all the top hits.

99
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,510

102
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,980
Now, here's the infamous
"miroir noir."

103
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,320
Gaze into it and learn
how you will die.

104
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,060
It's made
for the American market.

105
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,860
And here, my dear, is
my most celebrated illusion:

106
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,100
the Great
Milk Can Escape,

107
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,430
handed down to me
by Houdini himself.

108
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,270
Looks like there was magic
between you two.

109
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,540
The lady in question is
my late wife Esther.

110
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,310
She was
the only other soul

111
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,880
who knew the secret
of my greatest trick.

112
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,750
Now I'm alone with my memories
and my medical marijuana.

113
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,720
Would you...
be interested in teaching me?

114
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,820
A girl illusionist?!

115
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,030
Ladies are what you saw
in half and throw knives at.

116
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,130
They never wear the hat.

117
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,160
What if you just
taught me one trick?

118
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,030
Fine.
These are the Rings of Fate.

119
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,300
Come back in a week with
these rings linked together,

120
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,070
and maybe I'll--
Say, you did it already?!

121
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,340
Well, I guess
I can teach a girl.

122
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,940
Blackstone taught
a monkey.

123
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,080
I'm not exactly flattered
by that.

124
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,410
You should be.

125
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,680
That monkey wound up
with 18 car dealerships.

126
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,790
If you bought a family car
in the St. Louis area,

127
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,090
you bought it
from the mighty Chimpopo.

128
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,360
Huh.

129
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,460
Now, I'll start you off
with a little coin work.

130
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,400
Ooh!

131
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,630
And George Washington took
a trip down the...

132
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,840
Ear-y Canal!

133
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,970
My ear makes money?

134
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,610
Hello, boat store?

135
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,110
I'd like to order a boat.

136
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,310
What do you mean, dial tone?

137
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,810
Where'd you learn that trick,
in the Army?

138
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,380
From the Great Raymondo.

139
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,680
Ooh! He is great.

140
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,620
In '57, I saw him turn the
Secretary of Agriculture

141
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,490
into the Secretary
of the Interior!

142
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
It was hell on their wives,

143
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,060
but it sure brought down
corn prices.

144
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,490
Built a house outta corn.

145
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,160
Worst house I ever owned!

146
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,000
When it got real hot,
it smelled like Fritos.

147
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,500
Lisa can't be a magician!

148
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,140
That's my thing!
I'm the one that got

149
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,810
a magic set for Christmas
two years ago.

150
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,470
You never even opened it.

151
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,150
Need some help?

152
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,820
Kid scissors-- lame.

153
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,380
Ooh!

154
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,350
Let's see what else you've been
hiding in there.

155
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,790
I want my pot of gold!

156
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,630
Ay... ca... ram... ba!

157
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,860
I forgot
why I'm doing this.

158
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,430
Raymondo! I mastered
the slide pass

159
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,900
and I've almost mastered
the Denver slide pass.

160
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,440
And why is there always a
"Denver" version of things?

161
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,170
I'm sorry, Lisa.

162
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,380
I'm upset.

163
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,210
Bumped-off-the-
Mike-Douglas-show upset!

164
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,650
Oh. What's wrong?

165
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,920
'Sup, brahs?

166
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,820
It's me, Cregg Demon.

167
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,890
Who's ready to get
their magic on?!

168
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,060
Okay, for my first chillusion,

169
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,030
I'm gonna descend into hell
and pull up a skank.

170
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,870
Hi. Now, we've never
met before, correct?

171
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,870
That's right,
Cregg Demon.

172
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,910
Well, I don't need
your number, sweetie...

173
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,410
because it's tattooed
on my ass!

174
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,310
Yeah, it's on everyone's ass!
Yeah!

175
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,720
Eh! Disgraceful.

176
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,650
Any idiot with a soul patch

177
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,690
and a deck of cards
thinks he's a magician.

178
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,860
Magic is about
mystery, illusion,

179
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,690
pulling rabbits out of hats!

180
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,100
Presto! Oh...

181
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,960
Ew.

182
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,870
Today's lesson: feed your props.

183
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,600
♪ Old black magic has me in
its spell ♪

184
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:26,210
♪ Old black magic
that you weave so well ♪

185
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,910
♪ Those icy fingers up
and down my spine ♪

186
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,650
♪ The same old witchcraft
when your eyes meet mine ♪

187
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,090
♪ Same old tingle
that I feel inside ♪

188
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,860
♪ And then that elevator
starts its rise ♪

189
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,830
♪ Down and down I go ♪

190
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,460
♪ Round and around I go ♪

191
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,230
♪ Like a leaf caught in a tide ♪

192
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,840
♪ I should stay away,
but what can I do? I hear... ♪

193
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,900
Lisa! Lisa!

194
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,710
If you wanna do some real magic,

195
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,480
find me a boyfriend that don't
get all religious on me.

196
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,250
No!

197
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,420
Huh?

198
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,620
Oh...

199
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,960
Raymondo's greatest secret!

200
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,760
No, I shouldn't. I won't.

201
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:26,300
I guess I <i>can</i>
trust you, Lisa Simpson.

202
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:31,440
I am going to teach you
the Great Milk Can Escape.

203
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,580
You are?

204
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
Why?

205
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,450
If magic is not
passed on, it dies.

206
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,520
The only magic we couldn't make
was a child.

207
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,060
Now the first thing you must do
is make me a vodka tonic.

208
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,160
You're out of tonic.

209
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,960
That won't be a problem.

210
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,270
Students, teachers,
detentionees,

211
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,100
prepare to have everything
you believe

212
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,170
about milk cans challenged!

213
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,680
Willie, if you will?

214
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,620
God, if you don't
bring my Lisa back safe,

215
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,360
ants will burn tonight.

216
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,570
I believe the expression is
♪ ta-da! ♪

217
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,740
I don't know what to think
about milk cans anymore.

218
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,040
That was amazing.

219
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,140
I can see why they call you
The Great Simpsina.

220
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,950
My friends
call me Lisa.

221
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:43,950
She has no
friends.

222
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,080
Shut up!

223
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,080
Now, where were we?

224
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,420
I got to admit,

225
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,890
I was pretty nervous
when you were in that milk can.

226
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,420
Oh, it's a lot less
dangerous than you think.

227
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,230
You can see me do it again
in a talent show next week.

228
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,260
I'd like to come.

229
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,900
But only if I was sure

230
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,100
you wouldn't get hurt.

231
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,700
There's no chance
whatsoever.

232
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,340
I'll show you.

233
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,470
You don't open the top;
the locks are real.

234
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,140
The can is in two halves,
and they slide apart.

235
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,840
From inside, you
just push up.

236
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,480
Easy peasy.

237
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,520
And there's no way anyone
can figure out how it's done.

238
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,180
Well, I can think of one way.

239
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,850
You trick a dorky little girl
into telling you!

240
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,890
Yo, Dad!

241
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,320
It's a three-quarter

242
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,490
flange-less friction slide.

243
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,160
What about the locks
on the lid?

244
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,130
Shmuck-bait.

245
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,760
Sweet, sweet!

246
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,060
Oh, and the next time
it's my weekend with you,

247
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,300
I promise there will be
no chicks over.

248
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,400
Just you, me, the komodo dragon
and Ben Roethlisberger.

249
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,140
Hell to the yes!

250
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,200
'Sup, magicfreeks.
Last night, for serious,

251
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,980
I got haunted by a straight-up,
see-through ghost.

252
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,090
It was Harry H-Dog Houdini, yo!

253
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,960
Now, after calling me
"the new him"-- his words--

254
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,060
he told me the secret
to his Milk Can Escape.

255
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,030
Yeah.

256
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,260
I will perform this trick

257
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,230
at the upcoming
world magic championships!

258
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
I recommend parking in the mall

259
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,740
and taking the shuttle, yo!

260
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,200
Raymondo, I
am so sorry.

261
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,140
I got rolled
by a pro.

262
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,010
Do you know
what it's like to be

263
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,340
the kind of girl
that boys never talk to,

264
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,810
and then, suddenly,
a boy talks to you?

265
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,410
Get out.

266
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,220
Haven't you ever been
fooled by a pretty face?

267
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,520
Just once.

268
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,890
I trusted you.

269
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,550
Oh, you think I'm pretty?

270
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,260
Get out!

271
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,030
D'oh!

272
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,300
Lisa, don't feel bad.

273
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,170
Judas betrayed Jesus,
but he still got paid.

274
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,910
Oh, no...

275
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,210
I can't stand to see one of
my female children unhappy!

276
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,220
I'm gonna go pound some sense

277
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,420
into that ring-linking
rabbit-yanker.

278
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,320
Hey, let me down!

279
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,020
This is gonna leave
a diamond pattern on my skin!

280
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:21,360
Imagine if your greatest secret
was given to your worst enemy.

281
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,030
A peanut butter
and pretzel sandwich?

282
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,270
Mmm!

283
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,270
There's no way
a stupid Flanders like me

284
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,970
could ever have
thought of this.

285
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,670
Okay, maybe secrets
are a big deal,

286
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,140
but my daughter's
a good kid.

287
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,150
So why don't you act your age,
forgive her and let me down!

288
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,030
Hey, kid, nobody likes
a gloomy magician.

289
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,240
Except, of course,
Gloomo the Magnificent.

290
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,470
Raymondo, you forgive me!

291
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,940
Not so fast.

292
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,170
But still,
there is hope.

293
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,410
Lisa, we've all done
things we're ashamed of.

294
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,150
I briefly became
a disco magician.

295
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,720
Have you ever tried to put
a leisure suit on a bird?

296
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,850
You get his pants on,
he pulls his coat off,

297
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,320
and on it goes.

298
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:25,260
But now I need your help
to stop Cregg Demon.

299
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,900
All right, I want
close-up magicians on the left,

300
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,770
illusionists on the right,

301
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,240
and mentalists-- well, I don't
need to tell you.

302
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,840
Ah, come on, Lou, I need backup.

303
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,240
Wish I could help, Chief.

304
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,280
I'll take the box that
doesn't talk back.

305
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,410
Yeah, that's just
what you need, Chief,

306
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,480

Something's wrong.

324
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,260
The trick isn't working.

No.

328
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,900
We must not interfere.

You're just gonna
stand there?

330
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,240
No. With my back,
I got to sit.

331
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,210
Help!

332
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,310
Ah.

333
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:54,250
Aw, I can't stand you
looking at me that way.

334
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,280
That's better.

335
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,480
Help me!
He's going to die!

336
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,800
Lisa, magicians hate
to be rescued.

337
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,300
Now, if you'll excuse me,

338
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,240
I have to go to
the little magicians' room.

339
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,040
I guess it's up to me to save
you, Cregg Demon Magicfreek.

340
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,650
You ain't saving nobody
demon nothing freek!

341
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,610
Ricky Jay?

342
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,650
David Copperfield?

343
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,620
Penn?

344
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,120
Teller!

345
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,520
We switched the trick milk
can with a regular milk can.

346
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,720
But why?

347
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,790
Because, when he...

348
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,860
Quiet!

349
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,130
You talk onstage,
I talk offstage.

350
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,130
That was the curse
the witch put on us.

351
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
He stole all
our best tricks.

352
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,330
And he stole
my sexiest magical gestures.

353
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,200
Like this one-- ah.

354
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,570
Aw...

355
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,670
Wait, I know
he's an unethical magician,

356
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,710
and his tattoos are
an inconsistent mix

357
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,910
of hieroglyphics and cuneiforms,
but he doesn't deserve to die.

358
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,210
We ain't
asking, kid.

359
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,850
Get her!

360
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,460
Penn, just drop them!

361
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,190
I can't!

362
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,700
I never learned how!

363
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,070
I'll save you, Lisa!

364
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,740
The real magic is raising
three kids in this economy!

365
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:23,110
You can put the ball back now.

366
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,380
Hands off my apprentice,
amateurs!

367
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,020
Raymondo?

368
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,750
I thought I killed you
in Marrakesh.

369
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,260
That was my twin brother.

370
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,960
Ruined a lot of my tricks.

371
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,960
We might as well
finish the job now.

372
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,330
To show you we mean business,

373
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,600
I'm unbuttoning my shirt
and turning on a fan.

374
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,230
Wah. Oh, yeah.

375
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,640
It's magical.

376
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,910
I'm just an old man.

377
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,850
How could I ever hope
to fight you all?

378
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,780
Except... with this!

379
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,730
My beautiful body,
no longer properly lit.

380
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,330
My ponytail's been burned!

381
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,830
Teller, the witch's curse
is broken!

382
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,070
Penn, there never
was a curse.

383
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,970
You're a real jerk,
you know that?

384
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,710
Raymondo, I knew your
heart was as pure

385
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,240
as the ether
that helps you get to sleep.

386
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,310
Raymondo?

387
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,350
I believe the expression is
♪ ta-da! ♪

388
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,720
Hey, whassup?

389
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,160
Let's go home, Dad.

390
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,890
I'm through
with magic, son.

391
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,600
I'm gonna move back to Canada
and run for Parliament.

392
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,830
And here you go.

393
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,540
"Do not give your coat to..."

394
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,440
Damn it!

395
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,620
So that's why

396
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,090
Lisa excused herself
a few minutes ago.

397
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,360
Now, once again,

398
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,430
one of the most promising young
magicians I have ever seen:

399
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,930
the Great Simpsina!

400
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,460
Knock 'em dead, kid.

401
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,430
I'll be in my
dressing room.

402
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,540
Tell me if she falls.

403
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,680
Abraca-Milhouse!

404
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:43,020
Hello, Harvey.

405
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,850
I've probably
had enough.

406
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,620
Eh, a little more
