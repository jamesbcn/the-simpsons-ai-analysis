What? Oh!

104
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,599
Or you could just toss him in the woods

105
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,144
and let the wolves carry him off.

106
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,397
It's really up to you.

Dad, I love you this much,

114
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,162
but that's just under $900.

115
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:31,124
I wish I could go $17,000, but...

116

Sir, if I may.

118
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,132

120
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,089

121
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,384
{\an8}as a regulation-size tennis court.

122
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,888
Tennis court, eh?

123
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,521
Oh, I can't believe
we went through all that

124
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,850
just to wind up with a tennis court.

125
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,345
I'll bet you didn't see that coming.

126
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,647
You don't care what happens
to me when I die.

127
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,112
Of course I do, Dad.

128
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,493
Oh, and if it were up to me

129
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,860
you wouldn't die at all,

130
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:07,366
but try telling that
to Killy McGee up there.

131
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,830
(tapping sounds)

132
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,334
Ooh. What on Earth are you doing?

133
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,674
Practising tennis.

134
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,129
That's tennis? Oh!

135
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,590
Then what's the one where the chicks whale
on each other?

136
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,011

137
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,010
Yes! That's what I wanted!

138
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,223

That seems about right.

143

You know, a tennis court

144
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,699
can really make your house look classy.

145
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,370
I hear Mel Brooks has one.

146
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,118
I mean, <i>Sir </i>Mel Brooks.

147
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,291
And it's bad news for the gophers.

148
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,000
(muffled chattering)

149
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,041
And it's going to do wonders
for our social life.

150
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,206
Yeah, it'd be nice

151
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,503
to entertain friends and have people over.

152
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,877
Hey, you got a tennis court?

153
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,054
Keep walking, Flanders.

154
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,092
Will do.

155
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,344
Faster.

156
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,136
(grunts)

157
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,099

158
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:12,598
(all grunting)

159
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,389
Sorry. I grunted way too early.

160
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,847
We win again.

161
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,066
Hey, this was a lot of fun, guys.

162
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,399
Yeah, we never knew nobody

163
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,783
with their own tennis rink.

164
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,739
So what happens now?

165
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,860
Is the food free, or do we pay someone?

166
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,117
Of course not.

167
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,778
They send you a bill.

168
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,617
Well, that's why I asked.

169
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,712
That's how you learn,
by asking, you dumbass.

170
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,918
(both grunting)

171
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,127

173
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,335
BROCKMAN: Match point.

174
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,633
And how about that Stephanie
the weather girl?

175
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:48,677
(flirtatious growl)

176
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,429
-Homer, ball.
-(grunting)

177
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,562
Oh!

178
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:56,058
Ha-ha! That's game, set and match to us.

179
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,402
But the real winners here
are Marge's hors d'oeuvres.

180
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,939
Whoa, how do you come up
with such witty remarks?

181
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,693
{\an8}-(chuckle) Well...
-(static over ear piece)

182
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,154
MAN: Come on, come on. Hurry up.

183
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,534
(typewriter keys clacking)

184
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,071
"I guess you could say

185
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,324
It's my racket."

186
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,815
I guess you could say I'm Iraqi.

187
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,948
{\an8}(gasps) Get off my property.

188
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,497
So from now on

189
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,790
all hats are banned from the school.

190
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,254
Even bonnets?

191
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,094
Especially bonnets.

192
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,129
I've had it with that school.

193
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,713
-(doorbell ringing)
-Door.

194
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,007
(humming)

195
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,641
(gasping) Chief Wiggum.

196
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,888
Are you here to make a bust of some kind?

197
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,810
No, we're just, uh...
checking to make sure

198
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,520
you're having a crime-free morning.

199
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,440
Oh, as far as I know.

200
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,309
You know what would be a real crime?

201
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,395
What's that, Lou?

202
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,610
Uh, letting that tennis court go to waste.

203
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,320
Would you boys like to play tennis?

204
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,451
Why, yes. Yes, we would.

205
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,699
OK. We'll be right out.

206
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,281
Let's roll, Lou.

207
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,156
(humming)

208
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,243
Take it, Lou.

209
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,197
(Lou humming)

210
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,960
Huh?

211
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,915
Well, hello, Marge.

212
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,749
Lovely day for tennis, eh?

213
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,384
I thought you had your own court.

214
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,461
He did, but he had it converted
into a human chessboard.

215
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,009
Hey, Burns has been gone for a while.

216
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,473
Let's make a run for it.

217
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,683
Come back, fools!

218
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:15,722
Protect me.

219
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,635
(grunts)

220
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:19,806
Ah.

221
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,022
Hey, check it out.

222
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,564
I'm surfing the net.

223
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,897
(laughter)

224
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,321
His clowning around is putting me at ease.

225
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,033
No.

226
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,284
Yes! We win again.

227
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,155
Will you get serious, Homer?

228
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,042
I'd like to win at least once.

229
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,905
Come on, Marge, all sports have

230
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,617
their lovable clowns.

231
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,877
John Rocker, O.J. Simpson, Dorf.

232
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,880
(Marge grunts)

233
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,961
Hey, Homer. Here's a bloopie for you.

234
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,764
I've got it.

235
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,130
It's in the bag.

236
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,046
Ow!

237
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,045
-(laughter)
-(groaning)

238
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,796
Oh, no!

239
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,141
(sighing)

240
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,641
Hey Chief, we're going to bust up that
crackhouse tonight.

241
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,977
We did that last night.

242
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,811
Yeah, but this time
we got the right address.

243
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,316
-Uh, you coming?
-Well, I'd love to, Lou,

244
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,688
but, uh, I'm playing tennis
at the Simpsons' again.

245
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,526
Ooh, Maggie, are your ears burning?

246
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,862
The Simpsons?

247
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,066
You mean the L.A. Clippers
of backyard tennis?

248
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,617
(giggles): Yeah, they're easier to beat
than a suspect in shackles.

249
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,002
Pretty easy to beat
a suspect in shackles, Chief.

250
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,209
Well, that's the joke, Lou.

251
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,919
It's on the Simpsons
and their easy beatability.

252
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,040
(laughter)

253
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,046
-(gasps)
-(laughter continues)

254
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,092
I think they enjoy being humiliated.

255
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,894
I don't know what's sadder about
the Simpsons

256
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,798
the fact that we mock them
or that they shall never know.

257
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:39,758
(exclaims)

258
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,310
SIDESHOW MEL: Never, ever, ever.

259
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,731
-Ever.
-(gasps)

260
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,233
(sighs)

261
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,034
Do... I... have... cooties?

262
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,108
"No."

263
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,948
Ah, this home testing kit
saved me a fortune.

264
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,199
You'll never guess what I heard
in the supermarket today.

265
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,372
I found out we're the laughing stock
of the town.

266
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,702
Oh, well, that's bad news
for Dingbat Charlie.

267
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,458
He's gonna be crushed.

268
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:09,129
I thought our tennis court was bringing us
a little respectability.

269
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,710
Instead, people make fun of our lousiness.

270
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,916
OK. Now, some of that is me.

271
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,966
All of that is you.

272
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,220
You've gotta take this more seriously.

273
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,802
OK, honey.

274
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,677
I can see this means a lot to you.

275
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,734
I'll practice till my elbow
is swollen and discolored.

276
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,060
That's all I ask.

277
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,266
(grunting)

278
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,565
No. It's a smooth motion.

279
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,953
You follow through with your racket.

280
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,070
(grunting)

281
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,783
Uh-oh.

282
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,373
(explosion)

283
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,159
You know, this is such a beautiful day.

284
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,707
I don't know why we don't
operate outside more often.

285
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,671
(monitor flatlining)

286
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,378
Time of death, 10:15.

287
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,762
(laughing)

288
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,851
Good news, honey.

289
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,809
I found a way to prove
to the town we're not losers.

290
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,352
I entered us in a doubles tournament.

291
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,055
What? We're not ready to compete.

292
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,226
Don't worry.

293
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,193
The tournament's not till tomorrow.

294
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,654
OK, get ready for the serve.

295
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,450
(grunting)

296
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,912
Get them off! Get them off!

297
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,070
How embarrassing.

298
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,867
You take over, Bart.

299
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,752
Lisa! Lisa, beer me.

300
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,082
I'll be right out, honey.

301
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,377
Oh, that's OK. Bart's doing fine.

302
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,881
You just have another beer.

303
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,262
Now, that's the kind
of nagging I can live with.

304
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,259
So Barney's, like,
"You're on your own, dude."

305
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,222
And I'm, like, "Not even."

306
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,683
I don't know what this has
to do with the Civil War.

307
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,934
I'm getting to that.

308
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,019
(both grunting)

309
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,402
Lookin' good, honey.

310
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,861
I think you and I might just win
this tournament dealie.

311
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,784
Hey, Bart.

312
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,281
Yeah, you've got your Daddy's hustle.

313
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,994
Too busy to reply, huh?

314
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,946
I know how that goes.

315
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,495
Well, I think I'll go lay out
my clothes for the tournament.

316
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,036
(humming)

317
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,594
Perfect.

318
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,716
(happily humming)

319
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,931
Well, I'm ready for the big tournament.

320
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,143
Hey there, son.

321
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,683
Oh, hi, Dad.

322
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,386
With that little outfit on,
everyone's going to think

323
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,977
you're playing in the tournament.

324
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,272
I am playing in the tournament.

325
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,607
It's going to be tough without a partner.

326
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,821
{\an8}-I've got a partner.
-Well, good for you.

327
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,902
Anyone I know?

328
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,236
Yeah, you know her.

329
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,281
Oh. Hello, Homer.

330
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,986
Good morning, partner.

331
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,616
Um... there's something I should tell you.

332
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,464
The name of Bart's partner? I'm all ears.

333
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,381
Well, actually...

334
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:59,459
the name of Bart's partner... is... um...

335
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,127
Yes, darling?

336
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,125
I'm Bart's partner.

337
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,467
No. No, no. no.

338
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,012
You're <i>my </i>partner.

339
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,965
{\an8}Dude, I think the lady's
made her decision.

340
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,136
I'm sorry, Homie.

341
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,434
We'll talk about it later, OK?

342
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,308
No!

343
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,688
Traitors!

344
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,146
-(glass shattering)
-(tires screeching)

345
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,446
Uh-oh.

346
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,663
I don't think they saw me.

347
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,413
I'm going to put my trophy on the mantle.

348
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,413
How about you?

349
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,414
I was thinking mantle, too.

350
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,916
Talk about being on the same wavelength.

351
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,455
HOMER: Hello, Marge.

352
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,455
Hello, Bart.

353
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,546
How are the tennis partners?

354
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,045
Oh, Homie, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.
(sighing)

355
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,295
Don't touch me.

356
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,386
Your hands feel like salad tongs.

357
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,681
I just wanted to win for once.

358
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,345
Please, don't take it
as a threat to your manhood.

359
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,435
(Homer gasps)

360
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,519
My manhood? I never thought of that!

361
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,685
We were good, Dad.

362
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,772
They asked us to play
in the Krusty Klassic.

363
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:01,978
It's for charity.

364
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,737
It benefits victims of balcony collapse.

365
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,740
We could wipe out B.C. in our lifetime.

366
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,412
I don't care about B.C.

367
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,830
I care about M.E.-- my enjoyment.

368
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,162
(sobbing)

369
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,787
It's obvious what's happening.

370
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:23,627
I'm being replaced by a younger
more in-your-face version of me.

371
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,974
Dad, you're just going through
a classic Oedipal anxiety.

372
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,261
You remember the story
of Oedipus, don't you?

373
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,845
Hmm. Maybe five bucks
would refresh my memory.

374
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,482
(sighs) Oedipus killed his father
and married his mother.

375
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,730
Ugh! Who pays for that wedding?

376
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,442
I'm just saying
you feel threatened by Bart

377
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,033
but it's all in your head.

378
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,028
You're right.

379
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,279
But just to be safe,
maybe I should chain him up.

380
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,112
Dad, I think you're overreacting.

381
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,697
I think you're underreacting.

382
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,782
This session's over.

383
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,156
This session's under.

384
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,162
Good-bye.

385
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,243
Bad-bye.

386
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,040
(moaning)

387
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,463
No! No! Stay away from my wife, Bart!

388
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,389
Darling, you're so much handsomer

389
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,298
than my first husband.

390
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,637
I may have the looks,
but he's the trophy husband.

391
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,273
(laughs)

392
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,270
{\an8}He thought that trip

393
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,061
{\an8}to the guillotine factory was just for fun

394
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,555
{\an8}but it was the perfect place to shoot him.

395
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,193
(gasping)

396
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,194
Ah! That's the guy.

397
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,145
That's the guy from my dream.

398
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,283
Go ahead and smile, smart guy.

399
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,744
I'm going to mop you up like turkey gravy.

400
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,367
Are you sure you want me
to be your doubles partner?

401
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,997
Absolutely, sweetie.

402
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,548
And you're not doing it out of spite?

403
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,008
(chuckling): No, of course not.

404
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,048
Now, aim for your mother's heart.

405
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,375
(Lisa exclaims)

406
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,386
Dad, I don't want to enter the tournament

407
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,718
just to hurt Mom.

408
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,143
Oh, come on.

409
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,601
You've been gunning for Queen Bee

410
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,601
ever since you buzzed into this hive.

411
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,063
Now, serve.

412
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,193
(grunts)

413
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,765
MARGE: Lisa!

414
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,815
Did you make that awful effigy?

415
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,398
Hey, leave my teammate alone.

416
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,323
Lisa's your teammate?

417
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,822
(laughs)

418
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,243
What's so funny? I'm better than you.

419
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,832
Now, Lisa, you know that's not true.

420
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:15,948
How would you know?

421
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,615
Your backhand looks like a rusty gate.

422
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,043
You little...

423
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,411
Come on, Bart.

424
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,497
Babies.

425
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,333
(all eating noisily)

426
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,054
Telegram for Lisa Simpson.

427
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:32,974
(mimicking envelope opening)

428
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,600
Don't listen. It's a trick.

429
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,388
"Dear Lisa-- Psych!

430
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,392
Psych, psych, psych!

431
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,433
Signed, Super-psych."

432
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,425
I think he's trying to psych you out.

433
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:43,437
Look, we're all trying to have dinner

434
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,980
so why don't we just--
Psych! Psych! Psych!

435
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,396
(players grunting)

436
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,357
(ballboys groaning)

437
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,486
BOTH: Ooh.

438
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,122
(ballboys groaning)

439
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,205
Ooh, where did you buy
that novelty hand, sir?

440
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,917
This? Oh, it's just fluid collecting.

441
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,130
(grunts)

442
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,799
Hey, hey! What do you think, folks?

443
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,470
I hope I don't get arrested
for racket-earring.

444
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,090
(weak laughter)

445
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,297
Eh, what do you want?

446
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,767
I'm not going to do
"A" material for charity.

447
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,097
And after all, that is why we're here.

448
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,356
Well, look who's here.

449
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,319
You two are going down.

450
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,359
No, we're not.

451
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,782
You're going down.

452
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,945
Did you hear that?
She said we're going down.

453
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,241
All we can do is our very best.

454
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,985
Oh, that's loser talk!

455
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,697
(sobbing)

456
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,157
Now I'd like to introduce

457
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,827
two of the tennis world's
most unbeatable players.

458
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,797
Venus and Serena Williams.

459
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,508
Unbeatable, eh?

460
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,589
Comin' through! Hey, hi, Otto.

461
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,804
Sorry.

462
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,138
(laughing)

463
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,562
-What are you doing?
-That's our dad's seat.

464
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,021
Hey, that's great.

465
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,891
Listen, I need a new doubles partner.

466
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,148
My little girl's a lead weight.

467
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,270
You're dumping your own daughter?

468
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,897
Yeah, but only to crush my wife and son.

469
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,105
That's horrible!

470
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,534
Yeah, that's pretty low.

471
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,662
-Hmm, you seem less disgusted. Let's go.
-(exclaims)

472
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,330
Our next match is
Marge and Bart Simpson...

473
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,370
(applause)

474
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,622
HOMER: Boo!

475
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,544
...versus Homer and Lisa--

476
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,423
Sorry, that's Homer and Venus Simpson.

477
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,211
What? Huh?

478
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,085
Venus Simpson?

479
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,842
You're replacing me?

480
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:38,053
Now, Lisa, "dumping" is such a harsh word.

481
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,595
Let's just say I'm replacing you.

482
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,060
(Lisa sighs)

483
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,023
WIGGUM: <i>15-love.</i>

484
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:54,186
{\an8}Once again, I'm outraged
by this last-minute switch.

485
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,566
We all got problems.

486
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,282
I dropped my cookie.

487
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,028
(gun cocks)

488
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,574
You sure you want to risk it?

489
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,577
It's totally unfair for one side to have

490
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,449
a professional player.

491
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,866
All right, all right,
you guys can have Serena.

492
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,581
I just ate a personal pizza.

493
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,246
(groans)

494
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,665
Oh, you're dumping me.

495
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,343
Honey, I'll make it up to you
in bottle rockets.

496
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,342
(sighing)

497
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,179
OK, swing.

498
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,050
Run! Hit the thing.

499
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,137
Now run across the...

500
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,352
-(grunts)
-Yeah.

501
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,602
Whoopsie.

502
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,143
Marge, how bad do you want to win?

503
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,228
Oh. Oh, I'd do anything.

504
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,733
Good. Yo, Pete!

505
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:33,824
Pete Sampras!

506
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,109
Get over here!

507
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,492
Yes! I'm in!

508
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,738
(audience applauding)

509
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,622
(laughing)

510
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,577
Everybody's been dumped but me!

511
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,540
I'm undumpable!

512
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,500
ANDRE AGASSI: Yoink!

513
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,749
My tennis stick!

514
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,750
Who are you?

515
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,001
I'm Andre Agassi.

516
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,083
The wrestler?

517
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,207
Come on, tubby, get off the court.

518
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,424
Scat!

519
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,764
Come on. Let's play.

520
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,548
I've got to tape a Ho-Hos commercial.

521
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,934
Which one am I? Serena or Venus?

522
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,095
You're Andre. I'm Serena.

523
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,444
Ha-ha-ha! You're a girl!

524
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,560
Why don't we stop this nonsense?

525
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,317
I'm not mad anymore.

526
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,479
Me, neither.

527
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:19,436
I'm just enjoying some world-class tennis.

528
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,408
You know, there's a lesson here
for all of us.

529
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,659
It's better to watch stuff
than to do stuff.

530
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,992
Amen.

531
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,447
After the tournament

532
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,037
let's go out for a nice family dinner.

533
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,373
(chuckling)

534
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,667
Courtesy of Pete Sampras.

535
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,671
D'oh!

536
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:36,672
Sorry.

537
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,457
(chuckles) Sucker.

538
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,759
(theme music playing)

539
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,586
Shh!
