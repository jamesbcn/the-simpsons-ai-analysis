178
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,460
Not even close.

179
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,132
Do you have any more yellow hats?

180
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,546
You mean like the one
you looked really good in?

181
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,465
-Yes.
-No.

182
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:34,764
Oh...

183
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,677
(groaning)

184
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,936
(groans) You're still here?

185
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,980
No offense, but you look worse.

186
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:47,194
Your lack of remorse just makes me grow.

187
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,606
-(gasps)
-Now you're gettin' it.

188
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,741
Ha! Joke's on you-- I like gross things.

189
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,115
Hmm.

190
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,912
(grunting)

191
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,871
(laughs) Again! Again!

192
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,498
{\an8}And that leads to mate in three!

193
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,006
{\an8}I've got to say, it's so exciting

194
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,419
{\an8}to find out something new about you.

195
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,678
{\an8}Hey, I'm full of surprises.

196
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,470
{\an8}Ooh. Name another.

197
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,724
Actually, that's it.

198
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,135
Tell me something I don't know about you.

199
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,144
Okay.

200
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,556
Sometimes when I sweep,

201
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,194
I make little sweeping noises
with my mouth.

202
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,942
(whooshing)

203
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:29,363
Oh, here comes the dustpan.

204
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,243
-(gasps)
-(both moaning)

205
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,701
I can't find Sunny anywhere.

206
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,332
Sunny? No! We got to find Sunny!

207
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,040
Where-- Wait.
The baby's name is Maggie.

208
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,634
Hey, beach bums.
Man, did I crash last night.

209
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,211
Always sleep well after riding the waves.

210
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,297
Ah...

211
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,092
Have you seen your sister's hat?

212
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:58,306
Oh, did-did she have a hat?
I-I don't remember any hat.

213
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,639
Her name was Sunny,

214
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,734
and I loved her more
than any girl ever loved a hat!

215
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,940
(gasps)
Even Madeline from the <i>Madeline </i>books?

216
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,902
She only wore that because
it was part of her <i>uniform.</i>

217
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,574
Ask Pepito.

218
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,031
Mmm.

219
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,873
Hey, hey, hey, I do not like to see
that going on in my bar.

220
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,666
{\an8}Lenny, knight takes queen.

221
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,540
{\an8}Barney, mate in four.

222
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,127
{\an8}Homer!
You're playing like Polugaevsky

223
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,722
{\an8}at Mar del Plata. (belches)

224
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,718
Yeah, Homer,
you're some kind of an idiot savant.

225
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,891
Hey, I don't come here to be insulted.

226
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,350
Homer, we're just saying
youse got a special skill,

227
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,681
like a smokin' monkey
or a urinal cake with an ad on it.

228
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,228
Don't tell me you're not flattered
by those analogies.

229
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,234
(sputters)
You guys think you're so hot.

230
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,315
I could fit in a piece
of carry-on luggage.

231
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Oh-ho, I'd like to see that.

232
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,656
{\an8}Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

233
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,198
{\an8}Oh, no. I'm alone with my thoughts.

234
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,367
{\an8}No. No, no, no.

235
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,665
{\an8}The healthiest thing
is for me to let myself out.

236
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,419
{\an8}Oh, sure thing, pal.

237
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,884
Here you go.

238
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,011
So, Homer, how did you
get so good at chess?

239
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,722
I played against my dad.

240
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,352
Uh, was that fun?

241
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,231
It was, until I learned
the pieces weren't licorice.

242
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,809
(Mozart's "Requiem" playing)

243
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,524

<i>after my mother left us,</i>

244
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,225
<i>and he won every time.</i>

245
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,895
<i>And every time he won,</i>
<i>he laughed that horrible laugh.</i>

246
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,735
(laughing)

247
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,321
Aw, Mona.

248
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,236
(laughing)

249
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,080

253

You are ready now.

254
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,803
Thanks for the lessons, Professor.

255
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,103
You remind me of my son.

256
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,008
-Oh. Where is he now?
-He's...

257
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,388
right over there.

258
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,734
He just doesn't like chess.

259
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,654
<i>HOMER: I went back to play my dad.</i>

260
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,611
We had a beautiful thing here,

261
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,031
and you had to ruin it by getting good!

262
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,740
No more chess in this house!

263
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,450
But, Dad, it's our thing.

264
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,990
Well, we'll find another thing.

265
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,743
You listen to the radiator hiss
while I drink whiskey

266
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,536
under this naked lightbulb.

267
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,249
(radiator hissing)

268
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,080
It was a sad life, but I wasn't affected.

269
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,424

00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,930
Mmm.

275
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:51,811
(laughs)

276
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,396
You know these cartoons are made
by exploiting Korean children?

277
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,993
You ruin everything.

278
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,318

284
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,917
(gasps) Bart? What is it?

285
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:14,168
Um, listen, I have...
I have to tell you something.

286
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,421
I-I was jealous,
and I-I threw your hat away.

287
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,915
(gasps loudly)

288
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,676
Oh, that went a lot better
than I thought.

289
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,259
-Why did you do it?
-I don't know.

290
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,845
The important thing
is you got to forgive me right now.

291
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,221
I feel kind of guilty.

292
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,057
Then I hope your guilt will grow...

293
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,153
and grow...

294
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,809
and grow.

295
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,147
And no matter how much
you try to pretty it up...

296
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:43,487
it'll still be the most hideous thing
you could imagine!

297
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,952
(screams)

298
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,122
Nerds! Get 'em!

299
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,214
-(Homer groans)
-(Marge screams)

300
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,455
A cupcake? Please.

301
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,303
{\an8}No.

302
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,510
{\an8}Mm-mm.

303
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,050
{\an8}So what?

304
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,716
I'm truly sorry, Bart,

305
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,183
but it's a wound nothing can heal.

306
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,558
{\an8}A bunny and a hammer?

307
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,022
{\an8}Well, my mom did say bring home dinner.

308

309
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,534
Homer, listen, hey,
I got something very scary to tell you.

310
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,200
Now, I was on this alt-suicide subreddit,

311
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,660
you know, just-just checking in,

312
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,659
and I found out
why you are so good at chess.

313
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,122
Go on.

314
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:34,292
Chess represents your desire
to kill your father.

315
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,543
What the... That's ridiculous!

316
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,165
Now, I'm here to bowl! (groans)

317
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,343
<i>You'll end up in the gutter!</i>

318
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,176
<i>Oh, my head! Oh! I'll sue!</i>

319
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,759
<i>I can't afford the copay!</i>

320
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,014
<i>Won't someone reset us?!</i>

321
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,016
<i>Well, at least I'm safe.</i>

322
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,888
<i>(grunting)</i>

323
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,772

324
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,018
I'm in luck! It's still here!

325
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,153
(gasps) My hat!

326
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,276
Aah! My car! And my house.

327
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,832
Homer, before you give up,

328
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,458
I Skyped someone who knows
a little bit about chess.

329
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,626
Oh, I don't think any chess master

330
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:28,465
or even international master
could understand how I feel.

331
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,392
<i>I'm world chess champion Magnus Carlsen.</i>

332
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,222

333
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:38,348
<i>When I heard a fellow chess player</i>
<i>had a mental problem, I Skyped at once.</i>

334
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,977
I'm not a chess player anymore.

335
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,524
From now on, I'm only playing Stratego!

336
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,108
<i>I cannot play Stratego--</i>
<i>I'm scared of the bomb.</i>

337
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,744
Yeah, tell me about it.

338
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,570
<i>Homer, I'm afraid</i>
<i>you cannot run away from chess.</i>

339
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,907
The reason I got into chess
was because it didn't involve running.

340
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,583
<i>I share your disdain for exercise.</i>

341
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,043

<i>To find your true feelings,</i>

344
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,931
<i>you must finish your final</i>

<i>-I'm sorry, you cut out for a second.</i>

347
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,683
<i>Then you will eat a piece of cheese</i>

00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,265
<i>while the wife doesn't look.</i>

349
