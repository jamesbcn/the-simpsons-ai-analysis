00:00:04,426 --> 00:00:05,260
[Mr. Burns grunts]

2
00:00:05,344 --> 00:00:07,304
I'm just gonna attach this lapel mic, sir.

3
00:00:08,347 --> 00:00:09,640
[Mr. Burns groans]

4
00:00:10,724 --> 00:00:13,518
So you want me to talk about
Persephone Odair. That's easy.

5
00:00:13,602 --> 00:00:16,688
She was a brilliant entrepreneur
who wanted to save the world.

6
00:00:16,772 --> 00:00:19,316
How I wish that was her only shortcoming.

7
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:24,404
My company, LifeBoat,
can take an ocean of salt water

8
00:00:24,488 --> 00:00:28,450
and transform it into clean drinking water
cheaply and efficiently,

9
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:31,745
with a machine only the size
of a can of oats.

10
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:33,413
[audience gasps] Oats!

11
00:00:33,497 --> 00:00:36,458
Now, the doubters
call this goal impossible.

12
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:39,753
But I prefer to say, "I'm possible."

13
00:00:39,836 --> 00:00:41,338
[audience applauds]

14
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:43,131
[documentary music playing]

15
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:49,012
[narrator] This story's about
a little girl who had a dream.

16
00:00:49,096 --> 00:00:52,015
But it begins with another little girl
who allowed us to use the footage

17
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:55,727
from when she interviewed the first little
girl who was no longer a little girl.

18
00:00:55,811 --> 00:01:01,483
I'm so excited to be interviewing
Persephone Odair, CEO of LifeBoat.

19
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:05,862
So, Persephone, you were the most
be-badged Girl Scout of all time,

20
00:01:05,946 --> 00:01:10,284
and then followed in the footsteps of Bill
Gates by dropping out of Harvard early.

21
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:11,952
The earliest ever.

22
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:14,871
Our car didn't even slow down
on freshman move-in day.

23
00:01:17,374 --> 00:01:19,084
So inspirational.

24
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:23,797
What was the aha moment that gave you
the idea to start LifeBoat?

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,007
Great question.

26
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,051
And, Lisa, great questions are
the jackhammers

27
00:01:28,135 --> 00:01:30,721
which demo the walls
built by disruptophobes

28
00:01:30,804 --> 00:01:33,807
to create the open floor plan
of innovation.

29
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,476
I've always thought that about questions.

30
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,271
[Persephone] Lisa,
my grandfather was a World War II sailor

31
00:01:39,354 --> 00:01:40,355
whose ship was torpedoed.

32
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,941
He was stranded on a lifeboat, Lisa.

33
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:46,653
Surrounded by water,
but not a drop to drink.

34
00:01:46,737 --> 00:01:48,530
Don't tell me he died.

35
00:01:48,613 --> 00:01:54,578
Worse. He gave up and then he died of
quitting and super-duper dehydration.

36
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:56,371
But I will never give up

37
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:59,833
until I've raised enough capital
to make LifeBoat a reality.

38
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:02,127
So if you know any billionaires...
[chuckles]

39
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,048
Well, the only one in our town
is Mr. Burns, and he's awful.

40
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:08,425
Once, he clear-cut a forest

41
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:11,011
because he thought
a squirrel was looking at him funny.

42
00:02:11,094 --> 00:02:13,930
[dramatic music plays]

43
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:15,974
Montgomery Burns. Mmm.

44
00:02:16,058 --> 00:02:17,934
Interesting idea, Lisa.

45
00:02:18,477 --> 00:02:20,354
No, I didn't say it to be an idea.

46
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:21,646
He's terrible.

47
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,441
Whatever you do, don't go to him.

48
00:02:24,524 --> 00:02:27,611
[narrator] But the woman who once
tried to clone Sheryl Sandberg

49
00:02:27,694 --> 00:02:30,322
for a school project
would not be deterred.

50
00:02:33,742 --> 00:02:37,996
Welcome to Orlando. Quick heads-up,
we may have to cut this panel short

51
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,583
due to our third once-in-a-million-year
hurricane this season.

52
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:44,252
- [wind whistling]
- Put this on my reel!

53
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:45,629
Terrible luck.

54
00:02:45,712 --> 00:02:47,214
No fault of anyone's.

55
00:02:47,297 --> 00:02:50,509
Mr. Burns, climate change
has left the Earth in peril.

56
00:02:50,592 --> 00:02:55,013
Who sent you? John Muir?
Friedrich Engels? Mike Doonesbury?

57
00:02:55,097 --> 00:02:59,559
I'm getting word that this hurricane is
meeting up with the Everglades super fire.

58
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:03,855
Montgomery, I'm the founder
of a desalination company.

59
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:09,027
Our world is running out of water,
and we need a hero to rescue us,

60
00:03:09,111 --> 00:03:12,197
and I believe that
that hero is your money.

61
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,365
[wind whistling]

62
00:03:14,783 --> 00:03:17,119
We sell chemicals
that could put out that fire.

63
00:03:17,202 --> 00:03:20,163
Granted, those chemicals
turn alligators into Godzillas.

64
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:23,208
But we're working on a bomb
that can fix that.

65
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,919
Sorry, miss. Desalination is a snooze.

66
00:03:26,002 --> 00:03:28,463
But I do want in on the Godzilla bomb.

67
00:03:29,798 --> 00:03:32,676
[narrator] Persephone was not shy about
hounding Mr. Burns.

68
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,512
And he wasn't shy about hounding her.

69
00:03:36,763 --> 00:03:38,723
Some fish just swim with the tide.

70
00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:42,561
I'm the kind of relentless fish
that falls down ten times

71
00:03:42,644 --> 00:03:46,940
before it runs up the mountain
on ocean shoes.

72
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:54,531
[airplane approaching]

73
00:04:00,745 --> 00:04:03,331
[groans] Fine. You've got five minutes.

74
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:05,459
Who are these goateed wastrels?

75
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:06,585
A documentary crew.

76
00:04:06,668 --> 00:04:10,589
Only the most paradigm-shifting
start-up CEOs have them.

77
00:04:10,672 --> 00:04:14,759
Mr. Burns, I see your life
as a beautiful business opera

78
00:04:14,843 --> 00:04:18,013
and investing in LifeBoat
as the climactic aria

79
00:04:18,096 --> 00:04:23,101
that will put you in the same pantheon
as Getty, Vanderbilt, the Spanx lady.

80
00:04:23,185 --> 00:04:26,855
Desalination is an expensive
and inefficient industry

81
00:04:26,938 --> 00:04:28,523
begging to be disrupted.

82
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:30,692
Success is a decision.

83
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:33,487
Dare to choose it, sir. Dare to.

84
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,571
Of course.

85
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:36,781
Like how I chose to be born rich.

86
00:04:36,865 --> 00:04:39,826
Together we can disrupt big salt water.

87
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,828
You mean the ocean?

88
00:04:41,912 --> 00:04:42,913
Exactly.

89
00:04:42,996 --> 00:04:45,415
- Or should I say, excellent.
- Excellent.

90
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,586
Not only am I pledging much of
my personal wealth to LifeBoat,

91
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:53,715
but I'm giving the company Cooling Tower A
to use as its headquarters.

92
00:04:53,798 --> 00:04:56,510
Cooling Tower A
was Mr. Burns's favorite tower.

93
00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:59,262
He always said it held
so many precious memories.

94
00:05:01,723 --> 00:05:05,727
In addition, all workers in Sector 7-G
are immediately fired...

95
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:06,853
Hey, that's me!

96

97
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,525
And are rehired
at higher tech industry salaries.

Bless you, pig!

99
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:16,112
[narrator] Burns brought his wealthiest
friends into Persephone's fold.

100
00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:20,325
When I invest, I look at
the business's key fundamental:

101
00:05:20,408 --> 00:05:24,579
Am I under the delusion
that I have a shot with the CEO?

102
00:05:25,622 --> 00:05:26,623
[chuckling]

103
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:31,503
[narrator] Burns and Persephone were soon
running the new company side by side,

104
00:05:31,586 --> 00:05:35,006
overseeing a start-up culture
where everyone had a creative title.

and Status Quo Demolitionist.

00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:57,028
If anyone can transform Burns,
it's a visionary like Persephone.

114
00:05:57,112 --> 00:06:00,407
Like, if you work at LifeBoat, you have to
use these metal drinking straws.

I'm so excited to have you
on this journey with me.

126
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,231
Imagine a world
with an endless supply of drinkable water.

00:06:33,315 --> 00:06:40,280
A world where every hotel towel can be
used once and then dropped on the floor.

00:06:40,905 --> 00:06:42,282
Oh, there were a lot of changes.

129
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:46,077
Unlike when this was a nuclear plant,
security's super tight now,

130
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:48,663
and we have to sign stringent NDAs.

131
00:06:48,747 --> 00:06:51,041
And I am bad at keeping secrets.

132
00:06:51,124 --> 00:06:54,961

Lenny's crush on his Italian tutor.

for the company.

136

where I'm not supposed
to look at the camera?

Or is it like The Office,
where I always look at it

139
00:07:10,352 --> 00:07:13,355

turn my head on the pillow,

this May-last-minute-of-December romance.

to create a working prototype

of her amazing desalination technology.

156
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:32,553
The water in front of you comes from

So LifeBoat was just following
the tech industry playbook.

Or as I call it "lie-PO" until you IPO.

But the employees
were already dreaming of cashing out.

171
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:15,971
Tech salaries are the greatest.

172
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,933
This week I gave Marge 200 stock options
to go grocery shopping.

173
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,185
It didn't work at all.

174
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:24,104
I had to put all the food
back on the shelves.

tech workers were adapting to

176
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:29,360
a much different corporate culture.

177
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,945
At the new company,
people were so secretive,

178
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:36,200
they actually moved the Post-it notes
with their passwords off their monitor.

179
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:42,498
[Homer]
Workers were getting fired every day.

That tattoo is the intellectual property
of the company.

181
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:51,173
The whole company got so paranoid.

182
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:56,303
Because of those NDAs he signed, Homer
couldn't even tell me how his day was.

183
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,555
I can neither confirm
nor deny I had a day.

184
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,476
Well, it was strange they wouldn't
let me look inside the machine,

185
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,648

of Inside the Machine. [coughs]

Whenever a reporter came by,

cover something up.

Well, still better than
working for Zuckerberg.

189

They were hiding something,
and it was really freaking me out.

00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:22,371
So I emailed Persephone.

Persephone dominates my vision board.

00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:44,852
Sure, she married Mr. Burns,
but as CEO, a woman had all the power.

That's what made

Mr. Burns, you deleted all negative tweets
about Persephone.

00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,144
Is that evidence

My best friend, Carl, was abducted

Montgomery Burns wasn't happy with
the documentary about his wife's start-up,

Well, if I may Frink-splain,

00:15:49,856 --> 00:15:55,361
in 1970, a very popular diet soda
called Jab was discontinued

286

because of the overpowering sweetness
of its artificial flavor.

LifeBoat bought up thousands
of cases of unsold Jab sodas,

288
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:10,960
because Jab-a-tose was so strong, it could
completely mask the taste of salt.

Oh, my God.

That's the Jab-a-tose.

336
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:31,684
Your miracle invention is nothing
but claptrap.

337
00:18:31,768 --> 00:18:35,354
If you can just admit that,
maybe we have a chance.

338
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:38,691
Babe, the underlying imaginary technology
still works.

339
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,031
[Peter Coyote] And in that moment, this
unlikely and super gross love affair died.

340
00:18:45,114 --> 00:18:48,951
Yes, I was besotted.
Blind to her machinations.

341
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:50,495
She cost me billions.

342
00:18:50,578 --> 00:18:52,914
It wasn't that she was evil. I love evil.

343
00:18:52,997 --> 00:18:55,792
It's that she still insists she's good.

LifeBoat had finally hit the reef,

345
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:03,216
drowning its investors and employees
in poisoned water

346
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:05,259
and counterparty risk lawsuits.

347
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:09,764
But to this day, Persephone has refused
to admit any failure.

Testing showed your desalinator
did absolutely nothing,

349
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:14,602
your company is bankrupt,

350
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:18,523
and in the divorce, Mr. Burns
somehow got your high school friends.

351
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:23,277
What happens from here?

352
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:24,904
Well, Christiane Amanpour, as you say,

353
00:19:24,987 --> 00:19:27,031
things have never looked better
for the company.

354
00:19:27,115 --> 00:19:28,324
I didn't say that.

355
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:30,701
The reality is, you're in jail.

356
00:19:30,785 --> 00:19:31,786
[gates close]

357
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:36,457
Christiane, have I ever told you about
my grandfather's experience on a lifeboat?

358
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:38,960
Even that was a lie.

359
00:19:39,043 --> 00:19:42,213
Her grandfather wasn't in the war,
and he didn't die on a lifeboat.

360
00:19:42,296 --> 00:19:46,884
He's a CPA whose hobby is fixing
British spellings on Wikipedia.

[computer keys clacking]

362
00:19:52,598 --> 00:19:55,977
[sighs] Not only did I miss out
on once-in-a-lifetime start-up riches,

363
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,646
but I lost the most amazing woman
I ever met.

364
00:19:58,729 --> 00:20:01,482
I think in a few more months,
she might have even slept with me.

365
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:05,278
It's great to meet you in person
after seeing so much footage of you

366
00:20:05,361 --> 00:20:08,823
in our documentary,
The Man Who Sold Horse Meat Sandwiches.

367
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:12,243
Anything else to add?

368
00:20:12,326 --> 00:20:14,996
Just this: Don't feel sorry for me.

369
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,956
Time to rebuild and reconquer.

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,625

We also have over 90 hours
of them talking about umbrellas.

Maybe that could be a documentary too.

I once brought an umbrella
into the shower.

- How did you get clean?
- I didn't.

383
00:21:00,073 --> 00:21:02,242
But at least I didn't have
to take off me clothes.

384
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:06,329
As soon as I open my umbrella,
it stops raining.

You need a sunroof on it.

What about a giant umbrella you keep
in the trunk?

00:21:11,418 --> 00:21:13,920
Sounds like you're talking
about an umbrellaphant.

[groans] Can we get back to work?

389
