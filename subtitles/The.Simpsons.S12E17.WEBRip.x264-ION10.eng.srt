{\an8}If your mother wasn't so fancy,

18
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,188
{\an8}we could shop at the gas station
like normal people.

19
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,824
{\an8}I need this candy for school.

20
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,703
{\an8}-Candy class.
-Well, OK, but get five bags

21
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,160
{\an8}in case we eat four
on the way home.

22
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,160
{\an8}My teacher said I need cupcakes.

23
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,542
{\an8}-Cupcakes to learn.

00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,121

{\an8}(humming)

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,300
{\an8}We need these
because we have to...

29
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,046
{\an8}My doctor says and my garage mechanic
agrees that--

30
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,633
{\an8}-In the cart.
-Woo-hoo!

31
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,347
{\an8}You know, I always
felt sorry for Marge

32
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,598
{\an8}having to do the shopping
but this is kind of fun.

33
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,598
{\an8}Yeah. I wish Maggie had to go
to the emergency room more often.

{\an8}Hmm, I've never heard of a baby

36
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,609
{\an8}swallowing a magazine before

37
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,071
{\an8}and I'm a doctor.

38
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:35,661
{\an8}I don't know if it matters,
but it was a <i>Time </i>magazine.

39
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,988
{\an8}Does that matter?

40
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,243
{\an8}Uh-oh, this could be dangerous.

41
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,785
{\an8}What? What?

42
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,709

{\an8}Wait, I changed my mind.

45
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,756
{\an8}Stack it in the order
I'll eat it driving home.

46
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,919
{\an8}Sir, please!

47
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,717
{\an8}I've already bagged it
by color and in order of each

48
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,471
{\an8}item's discovery by man.

49
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,893
{\an8}The customer's always right.

50
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,471
{\an8}That's what everybody
likes about us.

51
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,596
{\an8}Now, mush!

52
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,432
{\an8}You tell him, Jumbo.

53
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,937
{\an8}And you, start over.

54
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,899
{\an8}I want everything in one bag.

55
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,059
{\an8}Yes, ma'am.

56
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,817
{\an8}But I don't want the bag
to be heavy.

57
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,859
{\an8}I don't think that's possible.

58
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,822
{\an8}What are you,
the Possible Police?

59
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,204
{\an8}Just do it.

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,740
{\an8}Hey, hey, watch what
you're doing there, sack monkey.

61
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,374
{\an8}You're bruising my DuraLog.

62
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,491
{\an8}Hurry up.

63
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,617
{\an8}I can't stand here
jabbing you all day.

64
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,955
Please, ow! Stop.

65
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,830
Bag boys have feelings,
too, you know.

66
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,787
No, you don't.

67
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,627
Ah, excuse me.
Is there a problem here?

68
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,422
No, I can handle it.

69
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,715
I'll get you, squealer.

70
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:36,718
Ow!

71
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,799
OK, that's it.

72
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,644
On behalf of Sack Stuffers
Local 199,

73
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,180
I'm calling a strike.

74
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:44,766
Strike! Strike!

75
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,889
(chanting)
Strike! Strike! Strike!

76
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,596
Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!

77
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,397
Oh, the bag boys are on strike.

78
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,112
(mock shuddering)
Ooh... I'm shaking.

79
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,573
Mr. Simpson, please,
will you go home?

80
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,784
If I can have this rubber stick.

81
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,204
Pledging to honor
the bag boys' strike

82
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,914
are the Brotherhood
of Fruit Packers and Unpackers,

83
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,655
the Shelf Dusters Union

84
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,497
and the Unattractive Waitresses
of America.

85
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,833
Kiss my grits.

86
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,748
(chuckling) Indeed.

87
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,085
Good luck, sir.

88
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,880
No bag boys are
going to stop Lenny

89
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,844
from hosting a casual
get-together.

90
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,426
Casual?

91
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,141
Ah, I can taste that
get-together now.

92
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,430
-(glass shatters)
-Hey! I was holding that.

93
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,644
Next time I'll knock
your hat off, scab.

94
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,975
(whimpers)

95
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,686
So hungry.

96
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,653
There's got to be
some food left.

97
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,736
Sulfur jerky?

98
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,740
Cream of toast? Where did we get
all this crap?

99
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,993
Most of it was sent by relatives
who couldn't see very well.

100
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,616
Hey, I found some eggs.

101
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,413
The mother abandoned her nest.

102
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,496
(angry squawking)

103
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,170
(screaming)

104
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,578
(moans)

105
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,463
{\an8}There's got to be something
to eat in this house.

106
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,256
(whimpering)

107
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,549
(sniffing)

108
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,465
Hey, the dog smells something.

109
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,465
Good boy, good boy.

110
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,057
Show us where the food is.

111
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,151
Where? Over there?

112
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,731
Hey!

113
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,652
(snarling)

114
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,738
(sniffing)

115
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,490
Yoink.

116
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,617
{\an8}-(snarling)
-My old lunch box!

117
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,908
Oh, that Amos Burke
made his own rules.

118
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,748
(humming)

119
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,303
(gasps)
Very old animal crackers!

120
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,418
Mmm. Mmm.

121
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:39,841
(chomping)

122
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,132
Homer, no!

123
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,585
Those were made in the '60s.

124
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,467
Mmm... turbulent.

125
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,811
-(clank)
-Ow!

126
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,061
What the hell-

127
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,347
Whoa.
A solid gold animal cracker.

128
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:59,567
"Find the golden giraffe and we'll
send you and your family to Africa."

129
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,780
Africa? They're bound
to have food there.

130
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,582
And on my free African safari,
I wanna do everything on this box.

131
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,830
I want to shoot a lion in the face,
fight Muhammad Ali...

132
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,504
and ride in a convertible
with two happy zebras.

133
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,343
Sir, that contest ended
30 years ago.

134
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,799
We don't even make
animal crackers anymore.

135
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,260
We make household poisons
and Christmas lights.

136
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,681
Your box made promises
of a "vacational" nature...

137
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,641
and I expect you to
live up to them.

138
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,011
We won't though.

139
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:35,348
Sir, with all due respect, an old box
of cookies is not a legal contract.

140
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,806
Ow! My eye!

141
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,520
-We're in big, big trouble.
-Is that our fault?

142
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,606
-He could sue us.
-It was defective string.

143
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,071
Yeah, and it's got
very sharp corners.

144
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,241
Mr. Simpson, we've decided
to make good on your vacation.

145
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,611
Whoo-hoo!

146
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,275
-(whispering) Hey, mister.
-Yes?

147
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,617
On the plane I'm gonna
need two seats-

148
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,503
for the twins.

149
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:01,093
-The Simpsons are going to Africa.
-TOGETHER: Yay!

150
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,340
-(drums beating)
-(vocalizing)

151
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,264
-(gasps)
-What is it, Ngongo?

152
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,352
Evil is coming.

153
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,259
-What shall we do, Ngungo?
-Uh-

154
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,307
You are Ngongo now!

155
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,231
Aaah!

156
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,990
Africa looks like
a beautiful jewel.

157
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:28,109
{\an8}And these musical garment bags
aren't bad either.

158
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,697
WOMAN (on P.A.):
<i>Attention, passengers.</i>

159
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,702
Please prepare for our
landing in Tanzania.

160
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:37,579
I'm sorry. It is now called
"New Zanzibar."

161
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:41,835
Excuse me. It is now called
"Pepsi Presents New Zanzibar."

162
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,924
Hello. Hello, Simpsons.

163
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,428
Welcome to Africa.

164
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,640
-I am your guide, Kitenge.
-Hey, how ya doin'?

165
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,642
-Hi.
-Hello.

166
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,683
Yo, Kitenge.

167
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:58,515
{\an8}-Isn't that cute? A bush baby.
-Where?

168
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,403
-Aaah! Shoo! Shoo!
-(chattering)

169
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:04,065
Oh, man. I just bought
this shirt.

170
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,155
-Who's Muntu?
-He is our leader.

171
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:19,464
He seized power in a bloodless coup--
all smotherings.

172
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,880
Just like Jimmy Carter.

173
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,087
(brakes screech)

174
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,380
OK. You'll be sleeping
here tonight.

175
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,925
On the ground?

176
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,428
No, Mom.

177
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,755
Ohh.

178
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,846
I will come down for your bags.

179
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,942
That's OK. I got 'em. (grunts)

180
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,848
(all gasp)

181
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,936
(squeaks, hisses)

182
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,935
Eh. Bound to happen.

183
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,199
-(insects buzzing)
-Help! Ugh!

184
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,491
This mosquito net's not working.

185
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:58,075
No, no. You have it inside out.

186
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,212
There.

187
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,958
When do we get to
see the animals?

188
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,752
In the morning, little one.

189
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:08,915
Now, good night and don't let
the bedbugs paralyze.

190
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:09,916
(door closes)

191
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,797
MARGE: Homie, did you remember
to tip Kitenge?

192
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,465
KITENGE: No, he did not.

193
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,182
All right! I got another one.

194
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,812
Hey, you didn't see a warthog.

195
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,694
I'm looking at one right now.

196
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,651
Mom! Bart implied
I was a warthog.

197
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,692
MARGE: Nobody's a warthog.

198
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,606
-What about him?
-(snorting)

199
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,525
-Aaah!
-(laughs)

200
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:41,039
(gasps) Oh, look, everybody.

201
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,172
(elephants trumpeting)

202
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,170
HOMER: Wow!

203
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,375
It just rolled over to 10,000.

204
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:03,478
Now we sit quietly
and wait for nature to unveil herself.

205
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,056

206
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,609
(squeals)

207
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,493
Wait. Rhinos don't
come from eggs.

208
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,491
-What did you just see, Lisa?
-I know, but--

209
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,624
-What did you just see?
-Hmph. (gasps)

211
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,120
Oh, now, come on.

212
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:27,126
Look, Mother,
by that tree-- Cheetah.

213
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:31,629
-(growling)
-Mmm. He doesn't look so fast to me.

222
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,453
Mmm. Poachers.

(growling)

224
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,913
(gasps) That's terrible.

225
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:07,115
Now, honey, poachers are
nature's way of keeping the balance.

226
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:11,588
Whenever there are so many species
that people get confused and angry,

227
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,091
a poacher is born.

228
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,302
I don't care. I hate them.

00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,222
-(all gasp)
-Let's get out of here!

230
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,811
They'll be back.
They left their cargo pants.

231
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:32,781
This is the earliest known
fossil of a human being.

232
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,648
It's over two million years old.

233
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,985
(blows raspberries)
I've got more bones than that guy.

234
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:43,164
If you're trying
to impress me, you've failed.

235
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,044
It's not the number
of bones, sir.

236
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,961
-It's the--
-You have failed.

Oh, thank you.
Your ground is so comfortable.

By the way, what kind
of blood is this?

-Cow.

Hey, Mom.
Look what Mbali gave me.

Hey, check it out.

245
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,190
Bart! I told you not to
get your lip disked.

246
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,187
All right.

247
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,408

This song has been
going on for hours.

253
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,264
Yeah. It's like
the Allman Brothers.

00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,806

Quick! Into the river.

-No, they don't. They-- Aaah!

OK, here's the situation.

Don't worry.

Being eaten by a crocodile...

290
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,066
is just like going to sleep...
in a giant blender.

291
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,027
Wonder where this river goes.

292
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,038

Now, according to animal crackers,
there's no river here.

Oh, no. It's eating us.

Now, Bart, go to the top
of that hill

318
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,115
and see if you can
spot our hotel.

319
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,664
BART: Mount Kilimanjaro?

320
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,117
-Go!
-(groans) OK.

00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,918
-Aaah!

322
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,052
{\an8}A chimp.

00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,798
{\an8}Hello, little fella.

324
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,920
{\an8}Hey, maybe he'll lead us
to bananas.

325
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,427
Or more mouthwatering monkeys.

(gasps) This is the place
I've read about--

329
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,402
where Dr. Bushwell
lives among the chimps.

330
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:28,033
Oh, isn't that sweet?
He named it after his wife.

331
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,032
{\an8}No, Dr. Bushwell is a woman.

332
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,074
Well, now I've heard everything.

333
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,826
It's kind of you
to take us in, Dr. Bushwell.

334
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,872
{\an8}-Yeah. Thanks for the grub.
-Grubs.

{\an8}(slithering) Whatever.

336
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,134
{\an8}Ah, there's a burst of flavor.

337
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,961
Your work has really
inspired me, Doctor.

338
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,167
And I love your sensible
ponytail.

339
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,588
{\an8}Well, thank you.
See, Jojo? She likes it.

340
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,734
So I notice your home
smells of feces.

341
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,598
-Yes?
-And not just monkey feces either.

342
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,436
Could we talk about
something else?

343
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,902
I-- I love what you've done
with these poles.

(chattering)

346
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,582
Every day I get up at 5:30,
watch the chimps...

347
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,080
eat a quick lunch of roots and water,
then more chimp-watching.

348
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,504
After dark I come home and think
about chimps until it's time for bed.

349
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,174
You must be the most
boring woman on earth.

350
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,343
Possibly, but--

351
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:31,091
I mean, I knew scientists
wasted their lives, but geez!

352
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,005
Homer!

353
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,602
-(screeching)
-BUSHWELL: What? What is it, Pointy?

354
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,095
(brakes screech)

355
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,897
Oh, no. It's the poachers.

356
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,994
Give us the chimps,
and no one gets hurt.

357
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,071
Absolutely not!

358
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,026
Will you help me
defend the refuge?

359
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,486
{\an8}Anything for these
noble animals.

360
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,657
(chattering)

361
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,963
So like us.

362
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,632
(all grunting)

363
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,302
(both grunt)

364
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,381
Huh?

365
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,256
-What?
-Aaah!

366
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,348
(together) Yes! D'oh!

367
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,109
-Somebody light this monkey.
-(chattering)

368
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,073
Aaah! Help! Bad monkey.

369
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,985
(chattering)

370
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,790
{\an8}(gagging)
Hey! Stop it, you creep.

371
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,207
-Greenpeace?
-That's right.

372
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,464
And we're not leaving
till we rescue every animal here.

373
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,838
Well, if you really
cared about chimps...

374
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:58,255
you'd know that Dr. Bushwell
is their best friend.

375
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,095
Oh, is that right?

376
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,600
Why don't you tell her
about the diamond mine, Doctor?

377
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,654
Diamond mine?
What are you talking about?

378
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,728
I'm talking about this.

379
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:09,978
(whistling)

380
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,070
(chattering weakly)

381
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,834
(gasps) The chimps are running
a diamond mine.

382
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,412
Why, what fascinating behavior.

383
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,036
I-- I must document
this new activity.

384
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,497
{\an8}Dr. Bushwell!

385
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,546
What, these? Well, they were
a graduation present.

386
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,337
Unbelievable.

387
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,255
This shaft must be
five miles deep.

388
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,639
(all grunting)

389
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,480
{\an8}(excited chattering)

390
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,603
{\an8}(derisive chattering)

391
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,567
MAN: Oh, for-- Look it.
There's more over here.

392
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,148
Look at this.
She's hidden diamonds everywhere.

393
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,534
Even on the soles of her shoes.

394
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:02,032
Yep. She's one of the 10 richest
chimp researchers in the world.

395
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,697
Look at me! I'm a scientist.

396
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:08,366
(laughs, sighs) Africa.

397
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:12,537
How could you exploit
your beloved chimps like this?

398
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,918
I think we should look at her research
before we condemn her entirely.

399
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,762
I haven't said anything
for a while.

400
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,968
Hmm.

401
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:27,727
These are just pictures
of monkeys from famous movies.

402
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,979
This is disgraceful, Doctor.

403
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,573
All right, so I snapped.

404
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,779
You don't understand
the crushing loneliness and greed.

405
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,204
Don't worry, Doctor.

406
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,869
We'll get you
all the help you need.

407
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,909
No! Don't put me away.

408
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,753
I'll give you diamonds.
Everybody wants diamonds.

409
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,039
Diamonds will make
everything all better.

410
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,833
Diamonds! Diamonds!

411
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,927
-What a nice lady.
-Very nice.

412
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,888
Hey, Lise, check it out.
Diamond vision.

413
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:03,890
Buzz off.

414
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,971
Hey, look. Our tour guide
got a new job.

415
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,927
MARGE: Mmm, quite a promotion.

416
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,187
I was wondering
what became of him.

417
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,110
What happened to
President Muntu?

418
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,518
I don't want to talk about it.

419
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:19,444
(all laughing)

420
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,608
HOMER (laughing):
He got overthrown!

421
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,737
Now he's just a stinkin'
flight attendant.

422
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,157
Hey, where's my pillow?

423
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,718
(theme music playing)

424
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,547
-(murmuring)
-Shh!

425
