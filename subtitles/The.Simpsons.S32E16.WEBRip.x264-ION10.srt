1
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,968
No, sweetie.
That's a deadly glass ball

2
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:10,171
that we hang
where babies can get it.

3
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,240
See? Deadly glass ball?

4
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,656
Todd Flanders?
How'd that get on our tree?

5
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:31,625
Christmas is no time
to think about your neighbors.

6
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,360
It's a very interesting story.

7
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,664
A Christmas story
of failing and redemption.

8
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,133
Isn't that
every Christmas story?

9
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,636
A Christmas story of your
father's failing and redemption.

10
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,305
Isn't that every Homer story?

11
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,307
This one also has a secret room,

12
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,676
and it's set
six years in the past.

13
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,879
Oh, thank God
it's not the horrible present.

14
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,347
What year did it happen?

15
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:55,015
Oh, you know the year.

16
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:57,952
The Oscar went to an overrated
movie that nobody remembers,

17
00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:59,753
Tom Brady won the Super Bowl

18
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,622
and a public figure
had to apologize

19
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,624
for saying something stupid.

20
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:05,426
- Oh, that one.
- That year.

21
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:07,495
Oh, yeah.
Remember it well.

22
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:09,296
Okay. So, Homer and I

23
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:12,166
were going
to the office Christmas party.

24
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:15,136
I had just lost
my last adult tooth,

25
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:18,105
- which they say is worth thousands.
- Grampa.

26
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:20,508
- This is my story.
- Fine.

27
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:21,942
We were getting ready...

28
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,812
Listen, before we go,
I want to ask you a favor.

29
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,481
Don't drink at the office party.

30
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,950
But then
it just becomes a meeting.

31
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,187
I'm serious. I don't want you
embarrassing yourself at work.

32
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:35,789
All right. I'll just drink soda.

33
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,759
- Water is healthier.
- Not in this town.

34
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,330
Kids, get the hot dogs!

35
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,799
Homer, that's not safe.

36
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,369
Marge, it's natural gas.

37
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,150
Marge. Marge,
Marge, Marge, Marge.

38
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,986
- When will you ever settle down?
- What the...?

39
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:09,657
Hey, Marge,
want to rub shoulders?

40
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,593
Cover yourself up
and quit hitting on my wife.

41
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,828
Oh, so now she's your wife.

42
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,231
I've never been at a party
where I'm sober

43
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:19,733
and everyone else is drunk.
This is a nightmare.

44
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,101
I know how you feel, pal.

45
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,003
I haven't had a drink
in four years.

46
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,306
You're so boring.

47
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,841
He's right. I am boring.

48
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,946
We should give Homer
a little help

49
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,048
enjoying the party.

50
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:40,921
So, if you're all partying,
who's running the plant?

51
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:44,191
We got a dog that barks
when a light goes red.

52
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:05,679
Ah, it's nice to get close
to the workers once a year.

53
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:09,817
- Are you enjoying your holiday?
- I was just watching

54
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:12,286
this fantastic movie,
It's a Wonderful Life.

55
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,054
A tribute to
my favorite character,

56
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:17,157
the conniving, evil banker
who ruins Christmas Eve.

57
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:20,261
I presume it ends
with Jimmy Stewart's suicide.

58
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,996
Attention! Attention!

59
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:25,266
I've arranged for some of
the latest hip music to be sung.

60
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:29,103
<i>Hark, the herald angels sing</i>

61
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,973
<i>Good old Monty is our king</i>

62
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,443
<i>He's a mean old crocodile</i>

63
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,681
<i>Worse than jock itch
by a mile</i>

64
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:44,184
<i>I can't wait
till Burnsy dies</i>

65
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:48,522
<i>Watching vultures
eat his eyes</i>

66
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:51,325
Not so fast.
Release the hounds!

67
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:54,862
On, Slasher! On, Gasher!
On, Mangey and Nips 'Em!

68
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:58,499
On, Stalker! On, Vicious!
On, Rabid and Rips 'Em!

69
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,343
Good night, Mr. Burns.

70
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:16,583
Die! Die! Die!

71
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,119
And cool me whiskey.

72
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:24,058
<i>Good King Wenceslas
looked out</i>

73
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,295
Homer, we've got to go.

74
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:31,231
Come on, can't I finish
filling my pants with shrimp?

75
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:40,341
I don't know what happened.

76
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,609
What happened
is what happens every time.

77
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,746
You got drunk,
and you made a fool of yourself.

78
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,584
I don't want you coming home

79
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:53,087
until I know you've changed.

80
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,423
Good night.

81
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,859
Aren't you gonna get out?

82
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:02,029
No, just drive me around
in circles, please.

83
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:06,133
Oh, sorry. You have to order
an Uber Sad for that.

84
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,073
There, there. Prices
are always surging at Christmas.

85
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,143
Where do I go? Where do I go?

86
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,313
Hey.
You got to bowl or go home.

87
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,217
Skate or go home.

88
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,788
Go home or go home.

89
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,257
Isn't a church
supposed to offer sanctuary?

90
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:33,227
I'll tell you what.
Quote one Bible verse,

91
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,396
and I'll let you in.

92
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,931
There once was a man
from Judaea

93
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:40,667
who said to my wife,
if I pay ya...

94
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:41,902
And no.

95
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:44,271
Please.
I have nowhere to go.

96
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:47,074
Well, there is one person

97
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:49,410
that takes the homeless,
lost dogs,

98
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:52,713
even grocery bags
carried off by the wind.

99
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:56,283
I don't know
how to put this.

100
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,719
Come on in, my brother.

101
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,522
You too.

102
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:09,363
Look, Maude. God blessed us
with another mouth to feed.

103
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,974
More like a sinkhole
that likes french fries.

104
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,300
Oh, now, Maude, Jesus said,
love your neighbor

105
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:16,136
even though he never seemed
to live next to anyone.

106
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,939
Please, Ned. I'm due any day.

107
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:21,975
Maude, when I look
in that man's face, I see Jesus.

108
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,511
When you look at everything,
you see Jesus.

109
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,648
I bet you're seeing Jesus
right now.

110
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,316
I love you so much.

111
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:30,951
Put him in your man cave.

112
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,286
Man cave?

113
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,321
My Son of Man cave.

114
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:37,291
The Wi‐Fi password is
sinners burn in hell.

115
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,293
The second S is a dollar sign.

116
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:42,129
The first L is a one.
The E in sinners is a three,

117
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:44,298
but the E in hell
is an E for eternity.

118
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:47,835
I'll just use
my data plan like an animal.

119
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:54,408
You ate the Christmas ham.

120
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:56,443
And it wasn't even cooked.

121
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,078
Wait, wait.
You were saving that?

122
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,247
It was still in the plastic.

123
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,749
That was plastic?

124
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,085
I know it's tough, Marge,

125
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,520
but you're doing
the right thing.

126
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,088
Just like I raised him.

127
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,857
Punish, punish, punish.

128
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:12,259
And after it's much too late,
love.

129
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,228
It's not just this one thing.

130
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:17,130
It's a pattern
of constant disappointment.

131
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:20,601
You must see it.
You live with us temporarily.

132
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,803
What do you mean, temporarily?

133
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,771
Nothing. Nothing, nothing.

134
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,540
Have a good night.

135
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,649
Oh, I can't take this place.

136
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:43,223
Even my peripheral vision
is betraying me.

137
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:55,669
So, wife threw you out, eh?

138
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:59,473
- Yeah.
- We've got a nice, warm bed for you

139
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,009
in the lake of eternal flame!

140
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:05,212
A house by the lake?
I could get some writing done.

141
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,080
In the lake.

142
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,850
Oh, thank God.
Any excuse not to write.

143
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,286
Kill me.

144
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,622
Hey, hey, kids.

145
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:16,924
Especially the little ones.

146
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,959
Here's an all‐new
Itchy & Scratchy.

147
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,627
Parental discretion advised.

148
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:23,297
But if they were around,
you wouldn't be watching.

149
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,577
Where's Daddy?

150
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:40,780
He won't be back
for a while.

151
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,949
It's okay. I love Bart.

152
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:46,253
I love Bart.
I love Bart. I love Bart.

153
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,221
And I love Lisa.

154
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,457
I love you,
I love you, I love you.

155
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,058
Oh, that's wonderful.

156
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,761
We can still have
a nice Christmas,

157
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,863
- even without your...
- Daddy's back.

158
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,131
Daddy's back.

159
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,700
Look at that hat.
He must be a millionaire.

160
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,070
Okay, it's time to go to bed.

161
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,039
We'll have fun tomorrow.

162
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:14,881
See? Even without Daddy,
it's Christmas at the mall.

163
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:18,818
Please give something.

164
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,821
I'm about to be the first person
ever dishonorably discharged

165
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,957
by the Salvation Army.

166
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,230
That was a real beard.

167
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,601
Can I get these
for me and Daddy?

168
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:37,637
I'm not sure Daddy will be back
by Christmas.

169
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:41,274
Ooh, I smell marital problems.

170
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,976
A salesman's dream.

171
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,312
Little boy,
if she doesn't buy it,

172
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,180
she doesn't love you.

173
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:50,283
Really? And do you have
a happy homelife?

174
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,752
Why, ye... No.

175
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,691
Aw, poor fella.
I know what'll cheer him up.

176
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,826
Homer, would you like
to say grace?

177
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,795
I'd rather just eat.

178
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,296
No grace?

179
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,765
Then I'm gonna let
my hair grow natural.

180
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,134
Homer, please.

181
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,236
Honor the Lord
until we're all bored.

182
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,473
Dear God, how you doing?

183
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,642
I know your son's
birthday's coming up.

184
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,244
Oh, with his mother, you say?

185
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,280
Oh, that's too bad.

186
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,416
Now, Homer, in this house,
grace is personal, pious,

187
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,985
and at least 500 words.

188
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,419
Fine.

189
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,555
Thank You, O Lord,
for my wonderful home,

190
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:29,823
which I'm not in.

191
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,726
And my beautiful family,
which I can't see.

192
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,261
I mean,
Flanders is great and all,

193
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:38,431
but even you must think
he's kind of a jackass.

194
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,300
What's a jackass?

195
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,102
It's a silly person, Roddy.

196
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,104
Daddy, you're a jackass.

197
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,339
Sheesh.
The mouth on that kid.

198
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:49,309
Ned, that man has got to go.

199
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,678
Maude, you know we can't
turn away someone in need

200
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:53,279
right before Christmas.

201
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,448
You're right.
I forgot my Christian values.

202
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:58,418
Could you please get our guest
some Christmas candy?

203
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:00,520
Absotively.

204
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:03,623
Get the hell out.

205
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,028
Where'd he go?

206
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,963
Can't be a rapture, I know that.

207
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,032
- Yep.
- Scram!

208
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,702
I have no luck.

209
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,044
Just keep bringing me drinks

210
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,112
until I pass out
under this table.

211
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:29,115
Also, you have tables?

212
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,820
Why aren't you home with Midge?

213
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:37,323
I've been kicked out.
I have no place to go.

214
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,792
Oh, you poor guy.

215
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,293
Let's take a walk.

216
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,066
Finally.

217
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,813
If only I could get back
in there tonight.

218
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,714
Well, actually,
there is a way.

219
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,250
What are you talking about?

220
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:07,020
There's a tiny little room
above your garage

221
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,421
that you've never noticed.

222
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,257
Until Marge forgives you,
you can hide out in there.

223
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,726
Have you ever stayed up there?

224
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,530
I haven't, but I did rent
it out to a nice Irish family.

225
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:24,604
Oh, Ma, this is the best place
we've ever lived.

226
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:27,474
We only have to clean
Moe's bar for seven years,

227
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,509
and then we get
our passports back.

228
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:56,102
God bless Bart.
God bless Mommy.

229
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,638
God bless Santa.
Santa bless God.

230
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:01,908
And especially God bless Daddy.

231
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,043
God, I don't know
if you could do this,

232
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,446
but I want a different father.

233
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,982
I'm home.

234
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,145
So cozy. Ooh, cheese!

235
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,647
Rat trap!

236
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,148
Ooh, more cheese.

237
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,150
Rat trap!

238
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,652
Ooh, rat trap!

239
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,921
Cheese!

240
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,890
At least I haven't seen
any spiders.

241
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:55,395
Cool. Now that I'm a bachelor
again, my hair is coming back.

242
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,071
Hey, Lenny.

243
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,940
Yeah, I'm doing okay.

244
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,108
You're living the life
you always dreamed of,

245
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,877
not being able to stand.

246
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:14,080
I'm so lonely I made a Marge
from insulation.

247
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:15,215
Mommy?

248
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,083
Bart and I decided we'll give up

249
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,919
all our toys for Christmas
if Daddy can come back.

250
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,454
But I'll need double
on my birthday.

251
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,922
Take it or leave it.

252
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:24,958
What's happened to you?

253
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,360
I'm becoming a jerk
because I have no dad.

254
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,096
So you'll be better
if he comes back?

255
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,966
Maybe not, but you won't get
all the blame.

256
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,409
Well, I want him back too.

257
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,380
I want him back,
but I need your father

258
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,249
to do one great thing.

259
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,650
One thing to show

260
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:53,086
that all the nonsense
I put up with has a point.

261
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,921
Now, we're going to go
to midnight mass

262
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,756
without your father.

263
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:59,058
Aw, missing church.

264
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,828
This is the saddest
I've ever been happy.

265
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,907
One thing. One gesture.

266
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,442
I know!

267
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:20,246
I'll do the thing that Christmas
is really all about!

268
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,582
Make cookies.

269
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,585
Dad made cookies!

270
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:27,920
How many did you eat?

271
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,523
Most but not all.

272
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,126
Oh, that's wonderful!

273
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,303
No forgiveness, no cookies,

274
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,737
and I burned the good drapes

275
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:47,273
so we'll have to get
corncob curtains.

276
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,575
I need a miracle,

277
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,811
but those never happen
at Christmas.

278
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,281
Contraction!

279
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,484
Oh, if only that pregnant woman
would stop that racket

280
00:16:58,551 --> 00:16:59,819
so I could think.

281
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:01,521
You could deliver the baby.

282
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,522
Wait, who are you?

283
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:03,756
I'm your brain.

284
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,200
How come I haven't heard
from you before?

285
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,226
Your stomach gets all the blood.

286
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,561
You shut up about that!

287
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,029
I know where you live.

288
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,864
Oh, the baby's coming.

289
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,200
Oh, where's your father?

290
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:17,403
He's delivering
Christmas turkeys to the poor.

291
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,905
That selfish jerk.

292
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,841
Did somebody order
an unlikely hero?

293
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,344
Maude, let's get you
to the hospital.

294
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,878
No.

295
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,213
It's too late.

296
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,249
Then I'll deliver this baby
myself.

297
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:32,418
How are you gonna do that?

298
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:33,853
The same way I learned

299
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,656
what the top ten bass solos
through history are...

300
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,524
Through YouTube.

301
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:44,697
Oh, there's always a commercial.

302
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:47,400
There will be a time,
mark my words,

303
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:51,170
where the monkey attempts
to eat your face.

304
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,942
If you've done
everything correctly,

305
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,779
your mother‐to‐be
is calm and peaceful.

306
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,213
Shut up.

307
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,815
You know nothing.

308
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:05,151
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to get angry.

309
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,218
That's okay.

310
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,653
Of course it's okay!

311
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,056
Could you do me a favor?

312
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,058
Anything.

313
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,159
Pretend to be Ned.

314
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,162
Okay.

315
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,698
Oodily doodily.

316
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,133
No clownin',
that baby's crownin'.

317
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,402
You're almost out of labor,
neighbor.

318
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,905
No, no. The real Ned.

319
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,340
I'm a left‐handed weirdo

320
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,076
with a cop mustache.

321
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,844
No. No, no, no.

322
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:35,848
I mean the quiet,
wonderful man I married.

323
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:36,915
All right.

324
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,250
To help you deliver this baby,

325
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,186
I'll make
the ultimate sacrifice.

326
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,655
I'll act like a weenie.

327
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:45,424
Maude, I know I'll love heaven

328
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,526
because you've made one for me
on Earth.

329
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,930
Let's bring another angel
into this world.

330
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,867
Perfectly normal.

331
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:57,903
Eight fingers and eight toes.

332
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,539
How long have you been here?

333
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,175
Long enough to see
the man I married

334
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,511
is heroic and wise

335
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:08,147
and capable and brave.

336
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:09,682
- And...
- Give me my baby!

337
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,517
I guess it is mostly yours.

338
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:12,518
Here.

339
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:15,054
Homie, you did great.

340
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,492
Oh, Maude.

341
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,693
I'm so sorry.

342
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,794
It's okay, Neddy.

343
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,562
I was in good hands.

344
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,198
I redeemed myself at Christmas,

345
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,399
like the Grinch,

346
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,834
the Die Hard guy

347
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,469
and Scrooged.

348
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:32,838
In honor of today,

349
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,307
we're gonna name our son Homer.

350
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:37,910
Todd Homer Flanders.

351
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,246
Todd's middle name is Homer?

352
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,914
Yep. And for similar reasons,

353
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,550
Maggie's middle name is Lenny.

354
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:49,421
But that's a story
for the next Arbor Day.

355
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,090
Well, I want to see
your secret room.

356
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:52,992
Oh‐oh‐oh, not so fast, boy.

357
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,594
First you have to tell me
one of your secrets.

358
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,096
Okay. Not saying why,

359
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,431
but you might want to get
a new toothbrush.

360
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,568
You too, son.

361
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:04,669
You too.

362
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:11,277
And I found out something else
about the day you were born.

363
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,711
What?

364
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,880
You were born
with a full set of teeth.

365
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,382
And here they are!

366
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,119
Where are my dentures?!

367
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:21,453
I got a hot date tonight,

368
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,656
and I want to show off
by eatin' chicken.

369
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:27,193
What am I doin' up there?

370
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,907
You think the kids can hear?

371
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,543
No, no, everything up here
is totally soundproof.

372
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,545
Well, don't let me stop youse.

373
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,581
What?
What are you lookin' at?
