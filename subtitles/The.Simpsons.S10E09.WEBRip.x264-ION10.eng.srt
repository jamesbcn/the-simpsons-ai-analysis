D'oh! (screams)

00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,958
{\an8}ANNOUNCER: <i>And now, the conclusion</i>

10
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,885
{\an8}We're safe now, Clarice.

11
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,298
{\an8}We made it away from that cursed ship.

12
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:39,097
{\an8}Now I can relax and take off
this stifling bikini.

13
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,062

-Mmm.

ANNOUNCER: <i>We'll return for</i>

<i>after these messages.</i>

18
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,031
{\an8}Well, I'd rather get a message

19
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,283
{\an8}than see another lousy commercial.

20
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,735
{\an8}(electronic voice) People of Earth,

21
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,365
{\an8}we have traveled all the way from space

22
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,541
{\an8}to attend the most astro-tastic event

23
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,870
{\an8}in the entire universe.

24
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,365
{\an8}(deejay voice) You said it, Phil.

25
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:07,086
{\an8}It's the Bi-Monthly
Springfield Sci-Fi Convention.

26
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,298
ALIEN 1: <i>That's right.</i>
<i>It's BI-MON-SCI-FI-CON.</i>

27
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,880
<i>Come meet all your favorite stars.</i>

28
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,756
<i>Mark Hamill!</i>

00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,013
<i>And many more!</i>

{\an8}ALIEN 2: <i>Plus tag-team robot wrestling.</i>

32
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,983
{\an8}<i>It's the mighty robots</i>
<i>of </i>Battlestar Galactica

33
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,559
{\an8}<i>versus the gay robots of </i>Star Wars.

34
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,274
{\an8}(grunts) Ow, ow! Stop!

35
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,027
{\an8}Please, save me, R2!

36
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,149

37
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,195
{\an8}C-3PO: Oh, you stupid little tramp.

38
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,369
{\an8}-You're so boring. I hate you!
-Ow, ow, ow!

39
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,578
{\an8}Remember, it's BI-MON-SCI-FI-CON.

40
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,910
{\an8}Be there... and be square.

41
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,037
{\an8}Well, beats work.

42
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,173
{\an8}Yup. Beats school.

43
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,875
{\an8}Sorry, we're all full.

44
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,054
{\an8}(roaring)

45
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,643
{\an8}Are you sure this is a sci-fi convention?

46
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,799
{\an8}It's full of nerds.

47
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,257
{\an8}-Hi, Lisa.
-Hey, Lisa.

48
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,927
{\an8}<i>-Guten tag!</i>
-Hi. (chuckles sheepishly)

49
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:14,898
People, people!

50
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,656
{\an8}This man has actually been in outer space.

51
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,279
Ha! Nobody cares.

52
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,785
{\an8}This is one small step
towards firing your ass!

53
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,748
Hey, wait. I saw that <i>Lost In Space </i>movie.

54
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,210
You are not Dr. Smith.

55
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,000
{\an8}Oh, the pain, the pain...
The pain of it all!

56
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,054
{\an8}(laughing)

57
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,418
{\an8}You have still got it, Dr. Smith.

58
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,625
Silence, you nickel-plated nitwit.

59
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,506
My dear boy, I'd be happy
to show you my resume.

60
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,064
If you'd care to meet me later
in the food court...

61
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,388
Danger, danger, Bart Simpson!

62
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,056
Someone has mixed an <i>Amazing Spider-Man </i>in

63
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,773
with the <i>Peter Parker,</i>
<i>The Spectacular Spider-Man </i>series.

64
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,114
This will not stand.

65
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,939
Pardon me, but I wish to tender

66
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,864
a serious cash offer for this stack
of water-damaged <i>Little Lulus.</i>

67
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,704
(groans) "A," that is not water,

68
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,569
it is diet Mr. Pibb. And "B," I... Oh.

69
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,582
Uh...

70
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,584
Tell me, how do you feel
about 45-year-old virgins

71
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,957
who still live with their parents?

72
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,253
Comb the SweeTarts out of your beard
and you're on.

73
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,587
Don't try to change me, baby.

74
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,416
-(shrill feedback)
-Welcome, futurists,

75
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,758
cyberphiles, and the rest of you
dateless wonders.

76
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,894
(cheering)

77
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,102
And now to push this convention
into hyperspace,

78
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,522
the man who put the "star" in <i>Star Wars,</i>

79
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,731
a real burr under Darth Vader's saddle,

80
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,942
Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill.

81
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,283
(cheering)

82
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,082
(cheering)

83
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,488
Hey, thanks everybody.

84
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,866
You know, I'm here today
as Luke Skywalker,

85
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,124
but I'm also here to talk about Sprint.

86
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,337
As you can see, you stand to save
upto 17 cents a month

87
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,049
over the more dependable providers.

88
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,549
(exclaims) Talk about <i>Star Wars.</i>

89
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,301
ALL: Yeah, yeah!

90
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,593
You stupid nerds!

91
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,136
He's trying to save you money
on long distance!

92
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,970
<i>Star Wars, </i>huh? Well, let me ask you this.

93
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,676
How many of you have ever dreamed of
being in that movie?

94
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,307
(cheers and applause)

95
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,524
Well, you're in luck,

96
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,983
'cause we're going to act out a scene

97
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,773
and I'll need a volunteer to play Obi Wan.

98
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,528
-Kenobi?
-Right here, right here.

99
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,859
(crowd murmurs excitedly)

100
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,614
Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark, pick me!

101
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,606
My whole life has been
leading to this moment.

102
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,738
Ah, like hell it has.

103
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,454
If anybody's going to play Obi, it's me.

104
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,874
All right, step away, foolish amateurs.

105
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,662
Just keep back. Keep out of it.
The role is mine.

106
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,286
With the acting and the groupies
and the "Luke, Luke, save me",

107
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:36,463
with the light saber and the...
(imitating light saber)

108
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,174
That's not how you...
(imitates light saber)

109
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,464
(shouts)

110
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:42,507
(all shouting)

111
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,222
We're doomed! Doomed!

112
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,852
(screaming)

113
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,719
Oh, God, can't this town
go one day without a riot?

114
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,520
Ya! Gadzooks. Where are my bodyguards?

115
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,269
Is there anything fluffier than a cloud?

116
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,187
If there is,
I don't want to know about it.

117
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,532
MAN: Oh, dear! Oh, my!

118
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,951
We're screwed. Use your light saber.

119
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,910
What, and break it?

120
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,869
You know, George Lucas
makes me pay for these.

121
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,369
Take him! He's the one you want!

122
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,253
Not the hair! Back off,
you freaking dweebs.

123
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,421
Oh, poor Mark Hamill.

124
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,090
(gasps) That swarm of nerds
is going to kill him.

125
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,499
(grunting)

126
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,377
(shouting) Nerds!

127
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,050
Get out of there! (grunting)

128
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,885
Mr. Hamill, Mr. Mayor, come on!

129
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,100
-Who are you?
-Homer Simpson, nerd buster,

130
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,931
and I'm getting you out of here.

131
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,886
(groans) I can't, Homer.

132
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,847
I twisted my ankle.

133
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,558
You guys go on without me!

134
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,148
Never! (grunting)

135
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,364
Follow me.

136
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,570
(grunts)

137
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,527
(strains)

138
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,623
How was I supposed to know
it's not a real spaceship?

139
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,332
BART: Dad, over here!

140
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,116
(panting)

141
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,917
Oh, my God!
Someone has to go back in for Maggie.

142
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,381
Forget Maggie. She's gone.

143
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,751
I've got Maggie.

144
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,801
Wow, that was close.

145
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,841
Well, thanks a lot, Homer.

146
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,135
Well, it's all... Hey, I thought
you twisted your ankle.

147
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,470
Oh, yeah.

148
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,305
Well, see, the thing about that is...

149
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,561
(screaming)

150
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,402
-(fire alarm ringing)
-(people screaming)

151
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,194
(groaning)

152
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,322
Hey, boss, we were just talking about you.

153
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,109
You call yourselves bodyguards?
You're fired!

154
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,903
Fired, huh? (chuckles)

155
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,157
Who else you going to find
to take a bullet for you?

156
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,619
Or have his genitals
hooked up to a car battery?

157
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,580
-I'll tell you who, him!
-Whoo-hoo!

158
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,871
Homer, I don't think you were listening
to what he just--

159
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,955
I said, "Whoo-hoo."

160
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,997
(grumbles)

161
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,180
As a bodyguard,
your only loyalty is to your protectee.

162
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,931
Not to your family. Not to your country.

163
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,564
Not to Mu-hammad.

164
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,810
Even during Ramadan?

165
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,442
Shut your sass-hole, boy.

166
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:00,148
These melons represent your protectees.

167
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,229
Throughout this course,

168
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,734
you will protect your personal melon

169
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,025
as if it was paying your salary.

170
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,610
What?

171
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,074
Okay, listen up!

172
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,945
My goal is to assassinate that watermelon.

173
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,543
Your job is to take the bullet. Go!

174
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,369
-(gasps and panting)
-Go, go, go.

175
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,504
Pow.

176
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,170
No...

177
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,291
Well, your dive wasn't bad,

178
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,996
but I just didn't believe your "no."

179
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,087
You got to sell it.

180
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,802
Remember, your "no"
is what gets you your next job.

181
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,934
Now drop and give me 20.

182
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,180
No!

183
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,142
Better.

184
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,308
You ladies are without a doubt

185
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,523
the most sorrowful clique at the dance.

186
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,566
Not one of you fit to guard
a Russian rock band.

187
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,240
However, your checks have cleared,

188
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,698
so you all graduate. Congratulations.

189
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,659
(cheering)

190
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,949
And now, in honor of your achievement,

191
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,493
here is the theme song
from the hit motion picture,

192
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,537
<i>The Bodyguard.</i>

193
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,420
<i>♪ And I ♪</i>

194
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:06,839
<i>♪ Will always love you ♪</i>

195
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,381
Yee-haw!

196
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:14,298
-Clear!
-Oh, for Pete's sake.

197
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,347
The pig is in the poke.

198
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,230
You know, I really don't care
for that code name.

199
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,978
-(Snowball meows)
-Look out, Marge! Cat!

200
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,770
-(grunting)
-(Snowball meows)

201
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,193
I know you're excited
about starting a new job,

202
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,863
but could you just relax for now?

203
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,320
Hold it. What's your clearance?

204
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,743
We just want to get a snack.

205
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,571
Access denied.

206
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,826
-But Da...
-(both moaning)

207
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,950
Homer, I don't want you using
your new sleeper hold

208
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,076
on the children.

209
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,082
They'll be fine in half an hour.

210
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,995
That's not the point.

211
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,083
And another thing,

212
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,957
I asked you to take out
the garbage three days ago

213
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,415
and you still haven't... (moaning)

214
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,507
Hmm, still half an hour till dinner.

215
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,803
Oh, well... (moaning)

216
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:56,756
Ow!

217
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,601
It's a real honor
to be guarding your body, sir.

218
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,904
Just remember, you represent
the office of the Mayor.

219
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,859
So always comport yourself
in a manner befitting...

220
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,400
Quick, honk at that broad!

221
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,783
-(car horn blowing)
-(wolf whistle)

222
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,201
Good work, Simpson.

223
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,239
I couldn't be happier
with the way that went.

224
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,286
Hey, Homer, I told you
not to come around here no more

225
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,448
till you paid your tab

226
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,116
or at least cleaned up that mess you made

227
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,544
in the bathroom. (stammering)

228
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,173
Mayor Quimby? Uh...

229
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,709
Homer, why didn't you say
you was with the Mayor?

230
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,133
Shove off, puke-holes! Get out of there!

231
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,592
These stools are reserved
for the Mayor and his cronies.

232
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:36,183
Ha! Here's a couple of Duffenbraus,
on the house, of course.

233
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,100
Mmm! Semi-imported.

234
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,227
-Keep them coming.
-(sighs)

235
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,598
Your generosity is greatly appreciated.

236
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:50,647
Especially during this
health inspection season.

237
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,033
Oh, yeah, yeah, right. Health inspection.

238
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,570
That reminds me... (chuckles)

239
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,985
Your change, sir.

240
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,910
We're working on that roach situation,
I swear to God.

241
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,655
Ah, you should see the hospital.

242
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,827
(bottles clinking)

243
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,125
And after Moe's, we went to Krusty Burger,

244
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,633
and the Mayor got some more change,

245
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,335
and I ordered a double-double,

246
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,545
but they gave me
the double-double-double-double.

247
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,096
And then Apu gave the Mayor
lots of change for--

248
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,850
Dad, don't you see what's going on?

249
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,892
That "change" was a bribe.

250
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,845
Oh, honey, don't be so naive.

251
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,396
That's how the world works.

252
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,729
Sure, the Mayor takes a few bribes,

253
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,435
but he also makes the trains run on time.

254
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,896
No, he doesn't.

255
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:38,195
Trains are regulated by
the Federal Department of Transportation.

256
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,030
And recent studies
have shown that... (moaning)

257
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,487
Homer!

258
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,077
Thank you, Mayor Quimby

259
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,536
for honoring us
with the school milk concession.

260
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,297
Well, the good children of Springfield
need their milk.

261
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,170
And I need my...
(coughing and clears throat)

262
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,428
Please accept this kickback
as a token of our esteem.

263
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,971
Thank you, Fat Tony.

264
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,604
However, in the future,

265
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,891
I would prefer a nondescript briefcase

266
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,225
to the sack with a dollar sign on it.

267
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,902
So, how did you get the nickname "Legs"?

268
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,520
Well, that's an interesting story.
(chuckles)

269
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,857
It seems, President Kennedy's father was--

270
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,073
Ooh! Mini-cannolis!

271
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,116
Hey, I called that!

272
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,988
I saw it first. Come back here. (growling)

273
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,235
Hmm. "Milking Room."

274
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,407
-I hope you cows are decent.
-(squeaking)

275
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:31,246
(gasps) Oh! Crap on a crutch!

276
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,253
(screams)

277
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,169
(screams) They're milking rats!

278
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,047
Milking rats!

279
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,934
Rats? I'm outraged.

280
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,761
You promised me dog or higher.

281
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,604
(exclaims and gasps)

282
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,602
(gulping)

283
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,439
-Ugh!
-(gulping)

284
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,859
-(gagging)
-(gulping)

285
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,149
(retching sounds)

286
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,317
(sucking)

287
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,532
Bart, no!

288
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,113
Hey, my milk,

289
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,988
I traded my math book for that.

290
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,704
Dad! What a nice surprise.

291
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,004
(retching noise)

292
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,659
Oh, get that away from me!

293
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,288
Kids, I don't want you
drinking any more milk, ever!

294
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,375
Can I still drink it?

295
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,921
-Go nuts.
-All right!

296
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,125
(gulping)

297
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,795
(gagging)

298
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,926
You monster! How could you do that
to the children?

299
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,765
Those wacky gangsters.
What are you going to do?

300
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,151
And to think I respected you!

301
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,979
And defended you!

302
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,694
You wouldn't even be alive
if it wasn't for me!

303
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,985
-(shouts)
-(screaming)

304
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,242
(gasps) Okay, we'll call it even.

305
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,985
Oh, my God, I killed the Mayor.

306
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,157
All right, stay calm.

307
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,745
I'll just use the body
to stage an elaborate farce

308
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,501
<i>-a la Weekend at Bernie's.</i>
-Help! Help!

309
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,464
(gasps)
His corpse is climbing the building!

310
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,126
I'm alive, you idiot. Pull me in!

311
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,385
Wait a second.

312
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,348
I'm not saving you unless you promise

313
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,008
to get that rats' milk out of the schools.

314
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,888
But the gangsters will kill me.

315
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,015
You're forgetting,

316
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,351
you've got the best bodyguard
in the business.

317
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,396
Now promise, or I'll let you
fall to your death.

318
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,860
All right, all right. I promise.

319
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,110
Shake on it.

320
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,281
(screams)

321
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,990
Relax. You're in good hands.

322
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,491
Now, come on, I'll pull you up.

323
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,663
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Not so fast.

324
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,291
I can see into
the interns' restroom from here.

325
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:34,579
(groans) Did you know that
this is how F.D.R. met Eleanor? Ah!

326
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,785
All right, pull me up.

327
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,340
Six queens. Read 'em and weep.

328
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,379
Not so fast.

329
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,215
Seven queens.

330
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,223
Freeze, Goombahs!

331
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,387
We're shutting you down,
you filthy Italians!

332
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,893
-(whispering)
-Oh, right, right.

333
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,765
Filthy Italian-Americans!

334
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,904
Gentlemen, if you would simply consult

335
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,940
my dear friend Mayor Quimby,

336
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,694
I am confident this can be--

337
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,685
Not this time, Fat Tony.

338
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,567
The Mayor's office is not for sale!

339
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,405
(all laughing)

340
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,530
Can you, uh, edit out the laughs?

341
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:16,247
I am not so much disappointed
as I am blinded with rage.

342
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,132
Ooh! The mafia guy's all mad.

343
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,919
Oh, what are you going to do?
Call your <i>Godfather?</i>

344
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,424
Huh? "Oh, Godfather..."

345
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,085
(fake whimpering)

346
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,142
Break it down.

347
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,347
It's pure.

348
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,853
Pull the plug, boys.

349
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,689
Run free, little vermin.

350
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,316
The city is yours.

351
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:50,026
And so, as the rats' milk is returned
to the sewers,

352
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,905
the circle of life is complete.

353
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,042
Uh, Fat Tony, do you have any comment?

354
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,249
I don't get it.

355
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,789
Everyone loves rats.

356
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,082
But they don't want to drink
the rats' milk?

357
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,786
Hmm. Any words for the Mayor?

358
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,496
Hello, Mayor Quimby.

359
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:06,376
I would like to remind you
that accidents will happen.

360
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,835
Like the killing of you by us.

361
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,007
Aren't you scared, Dad?

362
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,765
I mean, if I were Fat Tony,
and, God willing, someday I will be,

363
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,808
I'd just be stewing in my jail cell
getting madder and madder.

364
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,813
Oh, don't worry about that, boy.

365
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,475
He's already out on bail.

366
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,653
Well, I'm off to work.

367
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,401
You're guarding the Mayor tonight?

368
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,533
After Fat Tony swore revenge?

369
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,070
It's my duty, Marge.

370
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,243
Besides, those mobsters don't scare me.

371
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,952
-Bart, would you go start Daddy's car?
-Homer!

372
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,493
What? There's nothing to worry about.

373
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,827
Well, then you start it.

374
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,122
All right, fine. I'll take a cab.

375
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:42,666
(doorbell ringing)

376
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,125
Homer, I'm not sure it's wise
to go out right now.

377
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,973
I was thinking of a quiet evening at home

378
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:51,298
with the, uh... (sighs) wife.

379
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,675
Oh, I get it. You're worried about
those mobsters, aren't you?

380
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,973
No, no. I truly do want to stay home

381
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,727
with the... (sighs) wife.

382
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,940
You got to snap out of this funk, Mayor.

383
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,151
I'm going to take you someplace
where you can relax

384
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,481
and forget all about gangsters.

385
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,992
-Uh, excuse me.
-Yes?

386
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,492
Do you have a table for the Mayor?

387
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,334
Yes!

388
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,789
Why do you talk that way?

389
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,369
I had a stroke.

390
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,547
Dear Lord,
please make tonight's production

391
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,011
better than <i>Othello </i>with Peter Marshall.

392
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,932
HOMER: Okay, Mr. Burns, Fat Tony,

393
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,472
what's-his-name... Fat Tony? (gasps)

394
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,766
(exclaims)

395
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,023
All right, Fat Tony.
If it's trouble with Quimby you're after--

396
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:46,902
Please, I am only here
as a devotee of the lively arts.

397
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,652
But I do have something for the Mayor

398
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,824
that perhaps you could deliver.

399
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,819
Mayor, Fat Tony asked me to give you this.

400
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,124
You moron! That's the kiss of death!

401
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,623
Oh, no! Wait.

402
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,214
Maybe I didn't do it right.

403
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,789
Never mind that.
Just go patrol the perimeter.

404
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,207
Ah! Au gratin potatoes.

405
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,836
That's a quality side.

406
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:19,811
Uh... No!

407
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,810
(gulps)

408
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,815
Potatoes are clean.
The poison must be in the steak.

409
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,947

00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,996
This is a conceptual nightmare.

414
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,540
I mean, Nathan Detroit
would never wear this.

415
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,634
And this song isn't even in the show.

416
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,631
I don't have time for this.

417
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,341
I got 75 shortcakes to strawberry.

418
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,092
Now get out there, Luke.

419
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,384

I want his wife dead.

425
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,478
I want his cat and his dog dead.

426
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,606
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

427
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,282
Who was before the cat?

428
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,610
(sighs)

429
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,605
Just kill the Mayor.

430
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,828

Hey, you're in this number.

438
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,726
Get out there and shake that moneymaker.

439
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,310
But I'm just here to kill... Ah!

440
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,318
That guy with the knife
sure can dance, huh?

441
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,905
He looks awfully familiar.

442
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,700
I think I saw him in <i>Rent, </i>or Stomp,

443
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,124
or <i>Clomp, </i>or some piece of crap.

444
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,381
(cheering and applause)

445
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,919
Hey, pal, that's my headshot up there

446
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,553
next to the pepper steak,
and don't you forget it.

447
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,921
You're all talk, Hamill.

448
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,797
You never even finished Jedi school.

449
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,764
-(grunts)
-(groans) Oh!

450
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,599
-Show's over, Mayor.
-Look out! (grunts)

451
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:28,061
-(groaning and grunting)
-Ah!

452
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,853
-Give... Give me that knife!
-No. It's mine.

453
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,397
(whimpering)

454
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,570
Homer... use... the for--

455
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,440
-The force?
-The forks.

456
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,696
-Use the forks!
-Oh.

457
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,409
(both grunting and straining)

458
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,910
-(screams)
-Ya!

459
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,241
-(grunts)
-(screams)

460
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,196
Yes!

461
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,617
Nobody messes with the Mayor
when Homer Simpson's on...

462
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:51,997
Oh, crap.

463
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,335
Oh, Fat Tony.

464
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,842
What? What did I do?

465
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,429
I checked with the doctor.

466
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,227
He said Mayor Quimby's going to be fine.

467
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,230
And I was electric as Nathan Detroit.

468
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,363
What did you think of me?

469
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:18,989
Well, I'd say you were luminous,
magnetic... (sighs)

470
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,489
incandescent.

471
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,610
Oh, cheer up, Homer.

472
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,568
I think you made a great bodyguard.

473
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,408
Really? Would you say I was magnetic?

474
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,624
-Absolutely.
-Aw.

475
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,876
-REPORTER: Mr. Skywalker!
-(groans)

476
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:37,174
Homer, I think you know what to do.

477
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:42,134
(grunting)

478
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:46,427
-Shoot! I forgot my light saber.
-(groans) all right.

479
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,933
(grunting)

480
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,599
-Oh, wait. Here it is.
