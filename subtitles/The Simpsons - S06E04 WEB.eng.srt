1
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:06,131
The Simpsons.

2
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,201
The Itchy & Scratchy Show.

3
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,240
Thanks, kids.

4
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,785
Now we'd like to speak to you
seriously for a moment.

5
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,536
Yup. This week is
the grand opening

6
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,497
of Itchy & Scratchy Land...

7
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,832
The violentest
place on Earth.

8
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,001
And to celebrate,
for this week only

9
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:29,130
we're cutting ticket
prices in half.

10
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,715
Yow!

11
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,011
Kids, you heard
the cartoon rat.

12
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,655
If you haven't already
run to your parents

13
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,181
begging to go, do it now.

14
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,308
You won't be missing
anything funny.

15
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,851
I'll just be sitting here

16
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,255
reading this
grown-ups' newspaper.

17
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,147
Go now!

18
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,399
Dad!

19
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,901
Remember how you said
that going to.

20
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,278
Itchy & Scratchy Land
would be too damned expensive?

21
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,365
Oh everything's too damn
expensive these days.

22
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,409
Look at this Bible
I just got... 15 bucks.

23
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,537
And talk about
a preachy book.

24
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,581
Everybody's a sinner,
except for this guy.

25
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,083
But now
Itchy & Scratchy Land

26
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,960
is cutting ticket
prices in half.

27
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,087
Can we go, Dad?
Can we, can we, can we?

28
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,463
- Take it, Lis.
- Can we?

29
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,882
No, no, no, no, no.
Ask your mother.

30
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,676
Yay!

31
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,719
Mom, guess what?

32
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,139
We're going to
Itchy & Scratchy Land.

33
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,682
No.

34
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,183
I've already planned
our vacation.

35
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,395
We're going to the
Highway 9 Bird Sanctuary.

36
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,356
I understand they've installed
a new bird feeder this year.

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,277
It's shaped like a diner

38
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,280
and it's on this
really tall pole.

39
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,579
Mom, Dad, Bart's dead!

40
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,373
That's right...

41
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,625
Dead serious about going
to Itchy & Scratchy Land.

42
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,336
You know,

43
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,939
Itchy & Scratchy Land
isn't just for kids.

44
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,382
They have a place
called Parents' Island.

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,594
"Yeah, dancing, bowling,
fashionable shops

46
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,762
"over 100 bars and saloons

47
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,807
and a world-class
chemical dependency center."

48
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,560
TV Town! Hammock Land!

49
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,354
Oh, recipe-related
bumper cars.

50
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,358
Yay!

51
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,735
Wait a minute.

52
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,653
I'm not sure
about this.

53
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,173
Every time
we've ever gone on vacation,

54
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,199
I end up being
horribly embarrassed.

55
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,658
We end up in a big fight,

56
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,077
and we come home more miserable
than when we left.

57
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,287
You have to promise me that

58
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,122
this isn't gonna happen
this time.

59
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,916
Embarrassed?
What are you talking about?

60
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,877
Well, there was our trip
to the Amish Country.

61
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,463
Oh, yes.

62
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,340
Hey look, Marge,

63
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,091
they're still
not fighting back.

64
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,137
I can be a jerk
and no one can stop me.

65
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,934
Even worse was
our trip to Sandy Beach.

66
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,607
Suckers.

67
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,569
Shark Boy!

68
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,658
This year I want us to do things
together as a family

69
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,660
and get a lot
of good exercise outdoors

70
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,495
so we'll have a lot
of wonderful memories

71
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,578
of our vacation.

72
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,789
Don't worry, Mom.

73
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,540
We'll make you
proud of us.

74
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,751
Lobster hat,
fishnet Speedo Junior,

75
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:16,005
wheelie shoes,
invisible dog leash.

76
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,424
Well, I'm packed.

77
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,134
And remember,
every morning,

78
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,512
give one bowl of kibble
to Santa's Little Helper.

79
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,222
Do you want me to write
any of this down?

80
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:27,183
No. I ain't senile,
dad-blasted!

81
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,685
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye.

82
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,103
Bye, Grandpa!

83
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,229
Wait a minute.

84
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,730
What was that last thing
you said?

85
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,774
Grandpa's little helper?

86
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,985
What's that?

87
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,529
Which one of you
is the mailman?

88
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,700
Okay, let's make a pact.

89
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,743
This is gonna be
the best vacation ever

90
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,955
or we'll all agree to disband
and join other families.

91
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,164
Agreed.

92
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,709
Ah, the interstate.

93
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,502
Fasten your seat belts, kids.

94
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,505
We're on our way
to Itchy & Scratchy Land!

95
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,009
Don't worry.

96
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,469
I've got an ace
up my sleeve.

97
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,154
Dad, can we stop
at Flickey's?

98
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,488
No.

99
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,580
Oh, my God, what'll I do?
What'll I do?!

100
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,165
What's the matter
with you, Homer?

101
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:35,543
We don't have any fruits
or vegetables in the car.

102
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,837
The whole trunk's
full of them, Marge.

103
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,800
You got any fruits
or vegetables?

104
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,265
Hey. Mr. Wimbley,
it happened again.

105
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,184
Now to absorb
some local color

106
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,853
through the magic
of A.M. radio.

107
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,813
The Book of Revelations

108
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,233
tells us to watch for
the seven signs of evil...

109
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,819
...sign of evil number four.

110
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,489
Continuing our
"sign of evil" countdown

111
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,240
here's Vanessa Williams.

112
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,914
Aw, haven't we stood in five
different states long enough?

113
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:13,997
No.

114
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,261
We better find a motel
and stop for the night.

115
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,930
We don't need
to do that, Marge.

116
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,307
I'm not tired.
I'm not tired at all.

117
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,563
Ooh, glad that wasn't us.

118
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:42,693
North... south...

119
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,986
Ah, nuts to this.

120
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,822
I'm going to take
a shortcut.

121
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,305
Homer, no.
You're going to get lost.

122
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,991
Trust me, Marge.

123
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,661
With today's modern cars,
you can't get lost...

124
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,038
What, with all
the silicon chips and such.

125
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,092
All right, we're here.

126
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,052
Let us never speak
of the shortcut again.

127
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,180
Now remember,
we're in the Itchy lot.

128
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,603
We're now approaching
our final destination.

129
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,355
Itchy & Scratchy Land...

130
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,679
The amusement park
of the future

131
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,358
where nothing
can possi-blye go wrong.

132
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,070
Possibly go wrong.

133
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,865
Huh. That's the first thing
that's ever gone wrong.

134
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,926
One adult
and four children.

135
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,970
Would you like to buy some
Itchy & Scratchy Money?

136
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,347
- What's that?
- It's money that's made just for the park.

137
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,974
It works just like
regular money,

138
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,642
but it's, uh... fun.

139
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,353
- Do it, Dad.
- Well, okay, if it's fun.

140
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,230
Let's see...

141
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,815
I'll take $1,100 worth.

142
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,411
- Ha, cool!
- Wow!

143
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,412
Neat-o!

144
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,748
Such a violent motif.

145
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,500
Yeah, but it's just
pretend violence

146
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,627
which is actually
beneficial for children.

147
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,925
There's no need
to murmur, ma'am.

148
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,635
Here at Itchy & Scratchy Land,

149
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,346
we're just as concerned
about violence as you are.

150
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,932
That's why we're always
careful to show the consequences

151
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,391
of deadly mayhem

152
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,685
so that we may educate
as well as horrify.

153
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,146
When do you show the
consequences?

154
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,832
On TV, that mouse pulled out
that cat's lungs

155
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,525
and played them
like a bagpipe.

156
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,194
But in the next scene, the cat
was breathing comfortably.

157
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,612
Just like in real life.

158
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,198
Hey, look over there!
Yoing!

159
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,745
I'll have a Brain Burger
with extra pus, please?

160
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,747
- Bart!
- Eyeball stew.

161
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,792
Homer, We just got here
and already I'm mortified

162
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,561
beyond belief by your
embarrassing behavior.

163
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,145
I was just ordering
a cheeseburger, Mom.

164
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,798
They have violent names
for everything here.

165
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,716
Oh, I see.

166
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,218
All right.

167
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:14,762
I'll have the Baby Guts.

168
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,389
Lady, you disgust me.

169
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,892
Mom, that's veal.

170
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,230
You're sure
she'll have fun here?

171
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,400
Oh, of course.
Babies love the ball room.

172
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,370
"Torture Land."

173
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,914
"Explosion Land."

174
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,917
"Searing Gas Pain Land."

175
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,795
"Unnecessary Surgery Land."

176
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,839
Oh look!

177
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,632
It's the 12 noon robot parade.

178
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,051
Hurry up or we'll have to wait
for the 12:05 parade.

179
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:18,868
Wow, this is so much
like my dreams it's scary.

180
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,625
Aw, look at that
cute little baby ax.

181
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,212
It's cute,
but I'm sure it's very sharp

182
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,382
and probably dirty.

183
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,593
Dirty, maybe.
Dangerous, hardly.

184
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,927
These are the latest

185
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,846
state-of-the-art
animatronic robots.

186
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,807
They have sensors that ensure
they only attack each other...

187
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,476
Never the guests.

188
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,034
See all that
stuff in there, Homer?

189
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,370
That's why your robot
never worked.

190
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,881
This is just what
I was hoping for...

191
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,634
Spending the day together
as a family.

192
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,151
Yay!

193
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,654
You know, part
of spending time

194
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,155
together as a family

195
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,616
is spending time apart
as individuals.

196
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,410
- Parents' Island?
- Yeah-huh.

197
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,413
I'm sure we'll appreciate
each other all the more

198
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,955
when we meet up at dinner.

199
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,707
Are you kids gonna
be all right?

200
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,833
Kids?

201
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,718
It is the '70s...

202
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,845
Right down to
the smallest detail.

203
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,346
Hey, the bartender

204
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,973
even looks like
John Travolta.

205
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,558
Yeah. Looks like.

206
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,645
Look at all this
great stuff, Lis.

207
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,564
Cool... personalized plates.

208
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,565
"Barclay."

209
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,733
"Barry."

210
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:14,734
"Bert."

211
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,735
"Bort"?

212
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,486
Aw, come on... Bort?

213
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,613
Mommy, Mommy!
Buy me a license plate!

214
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,282
No. Come along, Bort.

215
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,742
Are you talking to me?

216
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,910
No. My son is
also named Bort.

217
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,746
Who are all
these characters?

218
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,622
Well, you're probably
too young to remember

219
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,726
the short-lived
"Itchy & Scratchy and Friends Hour."

220
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,251
They had to come up
with some friends.

221
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,211
There's
Disgruntled Goat.

222
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,464
Uncle Ant,
Ku Klux Klam.

223
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,547
Oh, yeah.

224
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,175
They weren't very funny.

225
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,259
I don't know.

226
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,622
Disgruntled Goat
had his moments.

227
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,362
Welcome to T.G.I. McScratchy's

228
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,824
where it's constantly
New Year's Eve.

229
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,618
Here we go again!

230
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:09,371
Three, two, one...

231
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,041
Happy New Year!

232
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,422
It must be wonderful

233
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,342
to ring in the new year
over and over and over.

234
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,135
Please, kill me.

235
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,321
The babies look unhappy.

236
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,656
Add more balls.

237
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,954
Roger Meyers, Sr.,

238
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:53,374
the gentle genius
behind Itchy & Scratchy

239
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,710
loved and cared about almost
all the peoples of the world,

240
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,797
and he, in return,
was beloved by the world,

241
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,092
except in 1938
when he was criticized

242
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,552
for his
controversial cartoon.

243
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,555
"Nazi Supermen
Are Our Superiors."

244
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,931
Among his proudest
achievements

245
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,724
was the full-length musical.

246
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,017
"Scratchtasia."

247
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,698
Hey Ma, I'm gonna
get me a picture

248
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,241
of this crazy critter.

249
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,914
Uh, no flash photography,
please.

250
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,211
Roger Meyer's
next full-length feature

251
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,839
was the wildly successful
"Pinnitchy-o."

252
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,134
Now you be a good,
Pinnitchy-o

253
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,386
and don't you lie.

254
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,597
I promise I will
never hurt you.

255
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,683
I wonder if this
kind of violence

256
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,227
really does
desensitize us.

257
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,566
Want to get
a sno-cone?

258
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,650
Okay.

259
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,282
So, Mr. Itchy,

260
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,410
you think you're
God's gift to women, do ya?

261
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,662
Don't do it, Bart.

262
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,965
I just wanted to entertain.

263
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,299
Can you believe

264
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,677
I keep getting
away with this?

265
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,303
Uh, officer?

266
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,271
Mop-and-bucket man to
the exit of The Nauseator.

267
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,649
We have another jumper
on the roof of T.G.I. McScratchy's.

268
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,067
We need more
"Bort" license plates

269
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,694
in the gift shop.

270
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,863
I repeat, we are sold out
of Bort license plates.

271
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,432
I really wished
they wouldn't scream.

272
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:38,913
Dad?

273
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,457
I kicked one of those

274
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,251
stupid Itchy characters
in the butt.

275
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,129
Yeah. There's just no way
to resist it, is there?

276
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,718
I want all five T-shirts to say
"Best vacation ever."

277
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,761
Attention, Marge Simpson,

278
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,138
your son has been arrested.

279
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,473
I'd be
terribly embarrassed

280
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,267
if I were that
boy's mother.

281
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,822
Attention Marge Simpson.
We've also arrested

282
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,606
your older, balder,
fatter son.

283
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,154
I'm so embarrassed.

284
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,489
I wish there was a hole
I could just crawl into and die.

285
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,033
Okay, throw her
in the hole.

286
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,660
Oh please! It was just
a figure of speech.

287
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,373
You've got to listen to me.

288
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,876
Elementary chaos theory
tells us that all robots

289
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,628
will eventually turn
against their masters

290
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,673
and run amok in an orgy
of blood and kicking

291
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,383
and the biting
with the metal teeth

292
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,760
and the hurting and shoving.

293
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,970
How much time do we have,
Professor?

294
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,181
Well, according to
my calculations,

295
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,642
the robots won't go berserk
for at least 24 hours.

296
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,316
Oh, I forgot to carry the one.

297
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,817
I have nothing
to say to you.

298
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,236
But Marge, I was
a political prisoner.

299
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,072
How were you
a political prisoner?

300
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,365
I kicked a giant mouse
in the butt!

301
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,825
Do I have to draw you
a diagram?

302
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,497
Oh, for gosh sakes,
what now?

303
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,256
Hey, look.

304
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,634
This one's coming on to me.

305
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,094
Yoo-hoo!

306
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,096
Mr. Robot.

307
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,395
Dad, I think you're
wrong about that robot

308
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,480
trying to be your friend.

309
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,148
Lisa, don't...

310
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,525
contradict...
your... elders.

311
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,111
Ah! My hair!

312
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,029
You chopped off my hair.

313
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,739
Oh, God, I'm ugly.

314
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,283
I knew we should have gone
to the bird sanctuary.

315
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:48,043
I need the biggest seed bell
you have.

316
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,087
No, that's too big.

317
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,799
A chopper! We're saved.

318
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,177
Hey, you're the guys
who didn't like our capering.

319
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,139
When you get to hell,
tell them Itchy sent you.

320
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,937
Oh, my.
It looks like we're doomed.

321
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,773
Back, you robots!

322
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,901
Nobody ruins
my family vacation but me

323
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,486
and maybe the boy.

324
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,924
Dad! The flash must have
scrambled their circuits.

325
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,676
What are you,
the narrator?

326
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,387
Ahh! Just keep taking pictures.

327
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,890
I'll get more cameras.

328
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,895
Smashy-smashy.

329
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,189
I don't approve of that.

330
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,030
Hey, mouse...

331
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,865
say cheese.

332
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,284
With a dry, cool wit
like that

333
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,785
I could be an action hero.

334
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,216
Die, bad robots, die!

335
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,943
With a dry, cool wit
like that I could be...

336
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,219
Who would have thought

337
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,654
that our visit to
Itchy & Scratchy Land

338
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,181
would turn out to be
our best vacation ever?

339
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,807
Yeah, best ever.

340
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,186
Are you two bonkers?
We almost got killed.

341
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,521
Not to mention all
the embarrassment I suffered.

342
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,441
But, Mom, it's exactly what
you wanted in a vacation.

343
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,276
It brought us
together as a family.

344
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,570
We got a lot
of good exercise outdoors,

345
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,614
and we have so many memories.

346
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:41,990
You know you're right.

347
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,618
This truly was the best
vacation ever.

348
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,061
Now let us never
speak of it again.

349
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,748
As Roger Meyers, Jr.,
the owner of the park,

350
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,918
I'd like to thank you for
stopping the killer robots,

351
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,671
and to show my appreciation,
here are two free passes.

352
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,964
But there are five of us.

353
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,465
Here are two free passes.

354
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,800
That's better.

355
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,843
Man, if this is happening here,

356
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,845
I'd hate to think
what's happening

357
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,889
in Euro Itchy & Scratchy Land.

358
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,019
Hello!

359
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,605
Itchy & Scratchy Land
open for business.

360
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,733
Who are you to resist it, eh?

361
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,068
Come on.

362
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,611
My last paycheck bounced.

363
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,614
My children need wine.

364
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,249
I hope you realize now

365
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,167
that violence on TV
may be funny,

366
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,836
but it's not so funny

367
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,146
when that violence
is happening to you.

368
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,189
But it would
be funny to someone

369
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,548
who was watching us.

370
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,675
No, Mom, he's right.

371
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,427
Observe.

372
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,974
Oh, my.

373
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,600
Lisa, go to your room.
