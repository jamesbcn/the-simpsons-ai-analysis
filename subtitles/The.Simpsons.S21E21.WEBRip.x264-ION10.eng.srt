00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,775
This is sweet justice

171
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,400
for how you greybacks treated
our boys at Andersonville!

172
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,108
(grunting)

173
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,408
When there's cruelty involved,
Bart sure knows his history.

174
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,123
Well, if Moe were leaving
with one of our wives,

175
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,834
it wouldn't be my Helen.

176
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,294
We just started
a new jigsaw puzzle last week.

177
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,794
We're still on the edges.

178
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,626
Well, Marge and I don't have
any problems.

179
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,552
We never even fight anymore.

180
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,931
What?

181
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,888
When a woman is peaceful
and content,

182
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,388
that means all hell is about
to break loose.

183
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,061
Think back, Homer.

184
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,019
When did you first realize
Marge was checked out

185
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,769
like a <i>Harry Potter </i>book
at the public library?

186
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,102
Think back,

187
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,147
think back,
think back...

188
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,781
(rattling)

189
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,108
Not that far back.

190
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,240
Homer, my Mother's party's
starting any minute. Get busy.

191
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,076
Moe, my in-laws are coming.

192
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:01,082
I need something strong enough
that I forget I hate them,

193
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,915
but not so strong
that I tell them I love them.

194
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,461
Sorry, Homer, I ain't
serving no liquor.

195
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,706
Just O'Glums non-alcohol beer.

196
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,798
Marge, this is crazy!

197
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,973
This is my mother's
80th birthday party,

198
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,682
and you're not ruining it.

199
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,512
Oh, you'll have a good time.

200
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,927
I invited a friend for you.

201
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:21,435
-Knock-a-doodle-you!
-Flanders?!

202
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,939
Neighbor Marge
invited me over

203
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,560
to be the little angel
on your shoulder,

204
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,067
so you wouldn't listen
to the 400 devils on the other.

205
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,439
D'oh!

206
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,396
D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh!

207

208
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,243
Hey, Chunky
with the Pants of Meatballs.

209
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,747
Take our picture.

210
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,579
All right.

211
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,464
I wasn't smiling!

212
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,620
What the...

213
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,708
I had something
in my teeth.

214
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:45,712
Why you...

215
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:46,713
My eyes were shut.

216
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,344
Lousy...

on backwards!

He can't do
anything right.

219
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,755
Except setting off car alarms
with his big fat footsteps.

220
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,224
You take that back!

221
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,894

car alarms sound)

223
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,225
Go ugly up someone
else's house,

224
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,902
you penis-curling
she-devils!

225
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,321
Ah, you got it.

226
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,819
We're not staying
where we're not wanted.

227
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,320
Every time I
plan something

228
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:15,202
that means something to me,
you somehow mess it up.

231
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,037
I need some cash, man.

00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,632
"You will lose all your money."

233
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,051

We'll see about that.

235
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,271
One, please.

236
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,600
You had that scar
before you got on.

237
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,765
-What scar?
-Oh, you'll find out.

238
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,074
Oh, I like keeping, I like
keeping records of myself.

239
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,859
Oh. Ah, man, do I make the soup.

240
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,743
My goodness,
do I make the soup.

241
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,240
Oh, I'm doomed!

242
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,702
Now, we don't know
for sure it's your wife.

243
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,123
It could be yours.

244
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,661
Oh, no, sir.

245
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,084
My marriage is solid.

246
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,922
Manjula would never cheat on me
like I cheated on...

247
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,788
-Oh, boy.
-That's right.

248
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,875
Now, was there
ever a time

249
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,250
when your wife might
have found comfort

250
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,628
in Moe's hairy arms?

251
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,255
Think back, Apu.

252
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,802

255
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,176
May we use your restroom

256
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,227
to change our kids out
of their cricket uniforms?

257
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,771
We got caught in the rain

258
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,534
because someone wouldn't use
international short form rules.

259
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,858
All right, calm down there,
'Pu and She-Pu.

260
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,784
-You can use the
restroom.
-(sighs)

261
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,782
My one day off
and it is miserable.

262
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,084
This is my day
every day.

00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,448
You see this?

264
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,745
I'm playing the world's
smallest sitar for you.

We are missing
a tuplet!

We must have left it
at that godforsaken pub!

270
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,878
How could you forget
your own child?

271
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,587
How could you forget
your own child?!

272
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,757
Oh, I can't believe
I married you.

Well, one of us has to go
back to Moe's.

284
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,405
Maybe have a beer or two,
shoot a game of pool,

285
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,866
and if I win,
I have to play the challenger,

286
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,827
such are the customs
of billiards.

If only that mark on your
forehead was an off button!

290
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,053
Hours later,
she returned--

291
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,137
smelling of beer
and pickled eggs.

292
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,142

I'll take your eyeball

your wife is not the putty

in the bartender's hands?

00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,171
Yeah, Padre.

00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,803

The ferry will be back

It'll take us home to
find out the truth.

I'm still mad at you
from last night.

333
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,190
Today's the first,
which means it was last month,

334
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,738
which means you're
being ridiculous.

335
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,622
Hmm, I'm glad we never
argue like that.

336
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,950
Yes, to argue, you have to
actually talk to each other.

337
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,406
Way to bitch up the
conversation, Helen.

00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,385
before Eve munched us
all to hell.

345
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,049
Mm-mm-mmm.

346
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,848
I'm gonna let you in
on a little trick

347
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,601
they taught us in
Divinity School.

348
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,143
Now take a look at
Helen over there.

349
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,266
She seems happy as a
clam, am I right?

350
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,613
LOVEJOY:
Oh, happier.

351
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:01,528
Where a clam has only one
pearl, she has many.

352
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,859
Now, don't you
jive me, Tim.

353
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:07,704
Just take your thumb and
put it over her mouth.

354
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:11,953
(growling)

355
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,496
See?

356
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,329
Looks like that she-cano
is about to blow!

357
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,875

358
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,959

362
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,811
Is the preacher here?

363
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,943
'Cause there's somethin'
I gotta get off of my chest.

364
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,860
Somethin' more suited
for the town gossip

365
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,729
than the minister's wife.

366
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,025
Do tell.

367
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,568
Uh... well,
there's this married woman

368
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,614
that I have feelings for.

369
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,157
And her husband don't realize
how upset she is with him.

370
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,531
Do I know her?

371
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,248
I'm, uh...
I'm sure you do.

372
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,329
Oh.
(giggles)

373
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,754
What's so damn funny?

374
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,332
I mean... (chuckles)

375
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,707
Oh.

376
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,631
That's right.

377
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,634
She touched his knee.

378
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,216
-His knee.
-LISA: Dad,

379
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,062
I'm gonna need some help
getting this off.

380
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,218
(Lisa grunting,
metallic squeaking)

381
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,612
Otto, you got to get us
back to town.

382
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,652
Oh, nobody told me
I had to drive the bus back.

383
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,446
(grunts)
I've mistimed some substances!

384
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,701
(metallic snapping)

385
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,285
Here it comes,

386
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,753
the moment of truth.

387
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,419
(gasps):
She's packing her bag.

388
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,585
So it is you,
Mr. Homer.

389
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,844
But let's be honest.

390
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,635
A woman her age
married to a man of--

391
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,390
how old are you, 65?

392
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,061
Thirty-nine.

393
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,100
Dear God, this day gets
more and more disturbing.

394
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,154
(Homer moaning)

395
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,348
(gasping)

396
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,438
Marge! No!
Stop packing your...

397
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,483
painting supplies?!

398
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,936
BART AND LISA:
Grandma?!

399
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,066
What do you think?

400
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,113
You're not leaving me?

401
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,566
My mother explained

402
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,116
that what happened at the
party wasn't your fault.

403
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,830
It's that Patty and Selma.

404
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,700
There's something evil
about them.

405
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,327
Did you know they smoked
when I was pregnant?

406
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,165
Oh, Marge,
you're not leaving with Moe

407
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,300
is the best thing
that never happened to me.

408
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,589
(Marge moans)

409
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:29,632
OTTO:
Okay, Reverend,

410
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,915
your place is next.

411
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,508
Actually, Milhouse
and I are next.

412
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,514
Huh. There's no suspense
at your place.

413
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,886
Even I've hooked up
with your old lady.

414
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,062
Sorry, kid.

415
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,140
You were my favorite uncle,
Uncle Otto.

416
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,412
Two tickets to Istanbul?

417
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,870
That's right, Tim.

418
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,489
I'm taking these bags,
and I'm walking out that door.

419
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,537
Meanwhile, you'll be
setting the alarm,

420
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,251
and then you'll join me
in the cab.

421
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,581
You're leaving... with me?

422
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,586
Would you rather
I bring someone else

423
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:10,708
on the world's most
romantic train?

424
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,378
Oh, Helen.

425
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,006
(moans)

426
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,473
Is that a train in your pocket

427
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,012
or are you just happy
to see me?

428
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,556
Both.

429
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,387
And so it is me.

430
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,385
(sad melody plays)

431
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,866
I feel the pain of
a thousand Squishee headaches.

432
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,576
My worst fears
are confirmed.

433
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,536
Apu, this man has come here
to convince me

434
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,376
to do something I never
thought I would do...

435
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,881
stay with you.

436
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,133
(gasps):
You mean you are
not leaving me for him?

437
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,125
(laughs)
Don't be ridiculous.

438
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,007
What am I,
blind and noseless?

439
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,434
Hey, hey,
I'm right here.

440
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,472
Believe me, I know.

441
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,886
Apu, our marriage
will never be easy.

442
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,385
But nothing worth
doing is ever easy.

443
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,727
It is true.

444
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,572
The tastiest ice cream
is the hardest to scoop.

445
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,688
But if you wrap something
warm around it...

446
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,985
Oh.

447
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,358
Very nice.

448
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,744
Well all's well that
ends well, huh?

449
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,491
Yes, except for...

450
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,323
why did you write
that horrible letter?!

451
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:23,498
When I saw how much trouble
your marriages were in...

452
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,539
<i>...I knew I had to act fast.</i>

453
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,423
<i>I got Marge's mother</i>
<i>to go to Marge,</i>

454
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,040
<i>convinced Helen to ride</i>
<i>the rails of romance</i>

455
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,587
<i>with the padre,</i>

456
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,260
<i>then I bought some</i>
<i>roadside corn, ate it raw,</i>

457
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,219
<i>got a kernel in my teeth,</i>
<i>flossed with the corn silk,</i>

458
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,301
<i>and then I came over</i>
<i>to fix things with Manjula.</i>

459
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,466
And I wrote that letter so
you three chumps would realize

460
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,766
that you have not been treatin'
your wives the way they deserve.

461
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,691
Think of it as
a wake-up call

462
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,269
from a man who ain't got
nothin' but a blow-up doll.

463
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,645
And even she left me.

464
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,652
Should not have used helium.

465
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,824
Moe, I don't know whether
to punch you or kiss you.

466
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,244
So I'm gonna do both.

467
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,492

MOE:
<i>So all you mugs out there,</i>

470
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:06,043
<i>be sure you don't take</i>
<i>for granted the woman you love.</i>

471
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:09,041
<i>Oh, and it's Mother's Day,</i>
<i>so call your ma.</i>

472
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,544
<i>Take her down to the diner</i>
<i>at the department store there.</i>

473
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,297
<i>Get her a roast beef on rye.</i>

474
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,128
<i>Oh, and make sure she gets</i>
<i>a fruit cup on the side.</i>

475
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,625
<i>She's worth it.</i>
