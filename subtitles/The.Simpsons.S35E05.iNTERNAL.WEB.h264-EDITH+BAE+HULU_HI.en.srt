If we're going
to cure this virus,

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,468
we need his DNA.

367
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:18,308
You three are the only ones
impervious to the virus.

368

You have got to find him.

Have you seen our dad?

No, just these hundreds
of silly versions of him,

375
00:17:33,705 --> 00:17:36,377
which is the greatest thing
that has ever happened to me.

Real Dad wasn't at the
bowling alley, the candy store,

380

or mocking the hippos
at the zoo.

381

Wait.

382
00:17:49,337 --> 00:17:51,073
Dad ate a bucket
of this chicken last night.

383
00:17:51,074 --> 00:17:54,080
When that happens, where does he
always spend the next day?

for your father?

387
00:18:00,994 --> 00:18:03,263
It's the closest one
Mom will let him use.

388
00:18:03,264 --> 00:18:06,303
Dad, we need you
to save the world.

389

Yeah, yeah, yeah,

391
00:18:08,476 --> 00:18:11,414
left this perfectly good
back scratcher in there?

392

Look, it goes all...

393
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:16,056

Wait. Hold on.
Why would I want that?

403
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,169
Finally, everyone thinks
the way I do.

404
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:42,442
Nobody's making up stupid rules
about bicycle helmets

405
