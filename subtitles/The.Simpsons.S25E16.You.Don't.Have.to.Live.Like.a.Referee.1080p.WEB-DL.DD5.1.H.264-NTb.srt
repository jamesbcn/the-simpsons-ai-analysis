Children, you're
in for a treat.

12
00:00:51,127 --> 00:00:54,395
Today's assembly is devoted
to a special kind of history.

13
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:56,176
(kids booing)

14
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:57,412
Living history.

00:00:59,306 --> 00:01:01,222
End this madness!

17
00:01:01,237 --> 00:01:04,005
We have two guests who have
come from Springfield!

18
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:06,174
<i>We</i> come from Springfield!

19
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,755
Illinois! 1858.

20
00:01:08,776 --> 00:01:12,190
Please welcome, here to debate
the important issues of the day,

21
00:01:12,207 --> 00:01:15,447
Stephen Douglas
and Abraham Lincoln!

22
00:01:15,464 --> 00:01:17,845
I appear before you
today for the purpose

23
00:01:17,865 --> 00:01:20,315
of discussing the leading
political topics

24
00:01:20,343 --> 00:01:22,476
which now agitate
the public mind.

25
00:01:22,502 --> 00:01:23,918
(kids booing)

26
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:26,338
Hit the dirt, squirt!

27
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:29,124
Well, it seems the, uh...
the good landowners

28
00:01:29,151 --> 00:01:34,636
of Springfield Elementary are rejecting
Mr. Douglas's position on tariffs.

29
00:01:34,656 --> 00:01:36,010
Get a room!

30
00:01:36,038 --> 00:01:38,465
I shared beds with men
all the time.

31
00:01:38,485 --> 00:01:40,509
(chuckles):
It was a common practice.

32
00:01:40,528 --> 00:01:43,095
Ooh, common practice.

33
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,914
(kids laugh, Milhouse gasps)

34
00:01:44,934 --> 00:01:48,433
Please, good people! These are
times of powerful passion.

35
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:50,439
(grunting)

36
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,311
Why are you
concussing yourself?

37
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:54,369
Why are you concussing
yourself?

38
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:58,598
Now, fellow countrymen, a house
divided against itself...

39
00:01:58,627 --> 00:01:59,325
Ow!

40
00:01:59,338 --> 00:02:02,121
Guess what, I also
play Frankenstein!

41
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:03,451
(growls)

42
00:02:03,485 --> 00:02:05,820
(kids screaming)

43
00:02:05,838 --> 00:02:07,972
Douglas is getting away!

44
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,517
Skinner!

45
00:02:22,544 --> 00:02:27,141
I have seven other principals, and I've
never yelled their names, not even once.

46
00:02:27,154 --> 00:02:28,603
You know what
these kids lack?

47
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:31,549
Well, certainly not
a caring superintendent.

48
00:02:32,082 --> 00:02:33,789
(chuckles): Well, I, uh...
(clears throat)

49
00:02:33,809 --> 00:02:35,916
Respect. That's what
these kids lack.

50
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:39,523
So we will hold a contest to make
them tell us who they respect...

51
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:41,027
who their heroes are.

52
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:44,160
A contest? But, sir, we don't
have any money to pay for prizes.

53
00:02:44,178 --> 00:02:47,466
We had to rent out our multipurpose room
to a Japanese-American social club.

54
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,773
(pachinko machines ringing)

55
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:50,096
<i>Tanpatsu!</i>

56
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,810
The answer is simple, Seymour:
Get a corporate sponsor.

57
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:55,428
But don't worry, you won't
have to compromise yourself.

58
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,142
So, from now on, our
cafeteria will only serve

59
00:02:58,151 --> 00:03:02,266
delicious Stuffwich's heroes,
hoagies and torpedoes.

60
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:04,222
What about po' boys?

61
00:03:04,235 --> 00:03:06,992
Sorry, Nelson. Poor boys such
as yourself will go hungry.

62
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,353
Now please welcome the
star of Stuffwich's ads...

63
00:03:09,383 --> 00:03:12,682
who lost 400 pounds eating
only Stuffwich subs...

64
00:03:12,695 --> 00:03:13,789
Ezra!

65
00:03:13,813 --> 00:03:17,607
Tell us your hero, and you could win
a Stuffwich college scholarship.

66
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:18,767
(kids exclaim)

67
00:03:18,787 --> 00:03:20,780
Then you can be
a hero like me.

68
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:23,895
- What makes you a hero?
- I don't eat as much as I did!

69
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:30,451
NELSON: So the chained-up dude cuts off his
own foot to save his family from Jigsaw!

70
00:03:30,471 --> 00:03:33,331
(voice breaking):
My hero is my mom's boyfriend

71
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:36,687
who took me to that
movie when I was three.

72
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:39,400
I call him Uncle
Rob because...

73
00:03:39,413 --> 00:03:40,887
he robbed us!

74
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:42,342
(sobbing)

75
00:03:42,883 --> 00:03:43,714
(giggles)

76
00:03:43,741 --> 00:03:47,714
Madame Curie, we just might
have this one in the bag.

77
00:03:48,715 --> 00:03:50,183
(Ralph giggles)

78
00:03:50,203 --> 00:03:51,737
(laughs)

79
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:56,141
My hero... or should
I say heroine...

80
00:03:56,162 --> 00:04:01,071
dazzled the early 20th century
with her scientific discoveries...

81
00:04:01,094 --> 00:04:02,915
(gasps)
Okay, calm down.

82
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,429
Maybe he's talking
about Margaret Mead.

83
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:07,928
...in the field
of radioactivity!

84
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:08,540
(gasps)

85
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:14,347
I give you Madame Marie
Sklodowska-Curie!

86
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:16,181
("La Marseillaise" playing)

87
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:16,888
(gasps)

88
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:19,952
No! No, no, no, no!

89
00:04:19,987 --> 00:04:21,721
(sobbing)

90
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:29,273
Martin took my topic.

91
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:31,062
What do I do?

92
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:37,595
Oh, just make a
speech about Dad.

93
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:38,955
Everyone does that.

94
00:04:38,972 --> 00:04:40,976
Everyone does that
with <i>good</i> dads.

95
00:04:40,996 --> 00:04:43,696
But with our Dad, it's like
climbing Mount Everest.

96
00:04:43,723 --> 00:04:48,064
You either plant your flag at the top of
the world or get frozen in agony forever.

97
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,156
Either way,
hell of a show.

98
00:04:50,176 --> 00:04:52,441
(music plays, kids cheering)

99
00:04:53,178 --> 00:04:56,405
People, please! Martin
has left the building.

100
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:58,151
He had an orthodontist
appointment.

101
00:04:58,177 --> 00:04:59,424
(groans)

102
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:01,112
Okay, Dad's my hero.

103
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,807

SKINNER (over P.A.):

I'm allowed to eat these!

112
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:30,306
Our final contestant is Lisa Simpson,
who was last seen leaving in tears.

113
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:32,505
- Near tears.
- But not in them?

114
00:05:32,526 --> 00:05:35,373
No. My hero
isn't famous...

115

Loser.

116
00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:38,555
- ...isn't rich...
- Pathetic.

117
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,444
...and isn't in any
history books.

118
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:43,294
- He makes me sick.
- He's my dad.

119
00:05:43,322 --> 00:05:44,155
What?!

120
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:46,686
He worked two jobs
to get me a pony,

121
00:05:46,706 --> 00:05:49,548
he started me playing the
saxophone you all love...

122
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,747
(murmuring dubiously)

123
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:54,014
...and anyone can
put a Band-Aid on,

124
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:57,710
but my Dad knows how to take
it off so it doesn't hurt.

125
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,366
- Well, ah.
- Oh.

126
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:02,257
The trick is: Wait
several weeks.

127
00:06:02,281 --> 00:06:06,334
And when my Dad was a soccer referee,
he had the guts to red card me,

128
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:10,709
his only talking daughter,
because he knew I was diving.

129
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:12,058
In the history of soccer,

130
00:06:12,084 --> 00:06:16,255
he is the only parent to ever
take sides against his own kid,

131
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,414
and he was right.

132
00:06:17,434 --> 00:06:21,252
He made me a better person,
because that's what heroes do.

133
00:06:21,278 --> 00:06:23,883
<i>That's</i> what heroes do.

Yes, which means
that nobody wins.

140
00:06:37,176 --> 00:06:40,093
The money goes back in
the school general fund.

141
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:43,406
But we will put both
speeches online.

- Hey, Dad.

154
00:07:12,624 --> 00:07:18,030
Lisa, your speech was one of the nicest
things anyone's ever done for me.

155
00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:19,645
When did you come
up with the idea?

156
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:22,226
You must've worked
on it for days.

157
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,414
Oh, Dad, you don't
want the details.

158
00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:26,525
No one wants to see the
sausage being made.

159
00:07:26,544 --> 00:07:28,252
There's sausage being made?!
Where?!

160
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:30,228
Homie, there's someone
here to see you.

161
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:31,715
Coming!

162
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:33,942
I haven't forgotten
about the sausage.

163
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:38,727
Mr. Simpson, I am the executive vice
president of the World Football Federation.

164
00:07:38,756 --> 00:07:39,536
Ooh!

165
00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:41,489
What you Americans call
"soccer."

166
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:42,172
D'oh!

167
00:07:42,202 --> 00:07:44,441
I'm sure you are familiar
with the World Cup,

168
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:47,281
the quadrennial drama
unmatched on the planet!

169
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,308
Oh, yeah. That's the thing
the guys at the dry cleaners

170
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:52,388
get so excited about
every four years.

171
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:57,162
I'm afraid there has been an epidemic of
referees being bribed to throw games.

172
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:00,711
From the premier leagues to the
playgrounds, all has been tainted.

173
00:08:00,737 --> 00:08:03,625
We need a symbol of
integrity like yourself.

174
00:08:03,643 --> 00:08:06,219
Of course I am, but
how do you know?

175
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:08,132
Oh, your daughter's speech

Much better.

179
00:08:12,332 --> 00:08:14,063
Mr. Simpson,
please help us.

180
00:08:14,087 --> 00:08:18,303
The rot is everywhere.
In fact, I see that I myself

181
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:20,783
am about to be arrested
for corruption.

182
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,080
You will have to take
it from here, Peter.

183
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,862
Yes, I will take good
care of your wife.

184
00:08:25,868 --> 00:08:27,603
Wait, what-what
does that mean?

185
00:08:27,614 --> 00:08:32,521
Mr. Simpson, I am the new executive
vice president of the WFF.

186
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:36,498
We need outsiders like you
to come to the World Cup,

187
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:39,624
as our guest, and ref
our games properly.

188
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:42,993
Well, no one has ever
questioned my professionalism.

189
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,823
Except at my profession.

190
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:46,172

think, sweetie?

192
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:50,570
Dad, they're offering us
an all-expenses-paid trip

193
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,784

event on Earth!

194

Oh, I wish.

to David Tyree.

197
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,762
But about the World Cup,
I need your answer now.

198
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:05,315
Oh, sure, why not?

199
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,486
"Congratulations on your purchase
of a FootMaster-brand soccer ball."

200
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:16,466

201
00:09:16,493 --> 00:09:17,786
Look, you got us
a free trip.

202
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:20,207
Just slack off and cash your
check like you always do.

203
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,521
I believe the sweet little girl
in 21-D would disagree with you.

204
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:27,369
- What the...?!
- I switched with her, Dad.

205
00:09:27,376 --> 00:09:29,876
My TV didn't work!

206
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:33,112

Well, look at you, using
approved electronic devices.

210
00:09:40,776 --> 00:09:43,460
To try to avoid any
misunderstandings in Brazil

211
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,275

I'm learning the language.

fairly-called match it was.

In choosing Homer Simpson, the
World Cup has met its goal...!

247

that is incorrect usage.

I couldn't stay afraid
of you forever.

261

The only thing that keeps
me from living here

262
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:19,516
is that fish that swims
up your pee stream.

263
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:21,341
That is a deal breaker.

00:17:01,927 --> 00:17:04,354
If I bet it, I
could double it.

348
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:05,664
But on who?

349
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,231
You know that Brazil
is going to win.

350
00:17:08,253 --> 00:17:12,250
Oh, thanks for telling me!
I was gonna tape it.

351
00:17:13,046 --> 00:17:15,092
Remember, I'll
be watching.

352
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:17,653
Wave a Brazilian flag so you
stand out in the crowd.

353
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:19,802
Don't do it, Dad.
Don't cheat.

354
00:17:19,822 --> 00:17:22,695
You're a funny one to
tell me about deception.

355
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,342
I'm sorry you weren't
my first choice.

356
00:17:25,362 --> 00:17:27,195
In fact...
(sighs)

357
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:29,912
I had my doubts about
using you at all.

358
00:17:29,934 --> 00:17:31,908
Well, if we're gonna be
brutally honest,

359
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:36,176
that drawing you made of me when you were
three was far from a perfect likeness.

360
00:17:36,195 --> 00:17:39,816
- You put it on the fridge!
- It was pity-fridged!

361
00:17:39,832 --> 00:17:43,019
All right, you're hurt.
I understand.

362
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:46,889
But when I made you my hero,
you lived up to it and more.

363
00:17:46,915 --> 00:17:50,745
You became the hero I
thought you could be, Dad.

364
00:17:50,776 --> 00:17:53,652
Oh. Oh, come here.

365
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,416
Everything's right
with the world.

366
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,684
<i>Except that you're about to
double-cross some gangsters.</i>

367
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,231
That's all right, brain.

368
00:18:01,258 --> 00:18:05,076
If I die, I'll be doing the
thing I love the most:

369
00:18:05,104 --> 00:18:07,509
Trying not to get killed.

370
00:18:07,515 --> 00:18:10,562
ANNOUNCER 2: <i>This match is tighter
than two dogs on a summer morn.</i>

371
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:15,893
<i>There's no score at all. Even the
slightest pebble could start a landslide.</i>

372
00:18:15,906 --> 00:18:18,394
ANNOUNCER 1:
<i>And El Divo goes down!</i>

373
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:22,585
<i>In the box! Will Homer award
a penalty kick to Brazil?</i>

374
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:27,111
Do it. Do it!
Call the penalty!

375
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:30,235
No penalty!
He dove, Dad!

376
00:18:30,449 --> 00:18:31,336
(grunts)

377
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:32,279
No penalty!

378
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:34,732
(crowd booing)

379
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:38,953
I repeat, no penalty!

380
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,074
No penalty.

381
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:48,086
ANNOUNCER 1: <i>The game, plus two hours
of funeral time, is about to conclude.</i>

382
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,174
And with Germany
the victor, two-nil,

383
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,892
in an unprecedented
display of rectitude

384
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,752
and stubbornness by
one Homer Simpson.

385
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:58,490
I've never seen the
Brazilians so depressed.

386
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:00,112
(sadly):
♪ <i>Olé...</i> ♪

387
00:19:00,146 --> 00:19:03,382
♪ <i>Olé, olé, olé...</i> ♪

388
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:08,952
You broke a deal with us.
And we have lost a fortune!

389
00:19:08,975 --> 00:19:09,723
(gasps)

390
00:19:09,736 --> 00:19:12,217
Well, at least I'll
die the American way.

391
00:19:12,242 --> 00:19:14,956
In a foreign country
wearing short pants.

392
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:17,829
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I want to say something!

393
00:19:17,844 --> 00:19:21,678
You have one minute. Wait!
Let it get to the 12.

394
00:19:21,698 --> 00:19:23,711
N... now.

395
00:19:23,736 --> 00:19:24,829
Um...

396
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:27,005
(speaking Portuguese)

397
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,412
How's she doing that?

398
00:19:35,438 --> 00:19:37,952
I don't know, but
she's my new hero.

399
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:41,045
Yeah, I was a little surprised
I wasn't considered before.

400
00:19:48,094 --> 00:19:50,607
Ah, your fluency
is impressive.

401
00:19:50,635 --> 00:19:53,921
You can help my son learn
Hebrew for his bar mitzvah.

402
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,898
But I'm still killing
your husband.

403
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:59,042
First, mazel tov.
Second, don't!

404
00:19:59,075 --> 00:20:01,722
Please, please!
I'm a mother.

405
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,875
Surely you have
a mother, too.

406
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,870
I do have a mother.

407
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,885
- Oh, she's right there.
- I'm sorry, my son.

408
00:20:08,905 --> 00:20:12,953
We owe a debt to the Simpsons
that can never be repaid.

409
00:20:12,972 --> 00:20:15,585
All that she did was
switch seats on a plane.

410
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:17,760
On a 15-hour flight!

411
00:20:19,144 --> 00:20:19,991
You are free to go.

412
00:20:20,026 --> 00:20:21,994
(dirge playing)

413
00:20:22,701 --> 00:20:24,388
No penalty.

414
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,181
Fine.

415
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:34,583
(birds squawking)

416
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,467
Wow, the Amazon is
just like I pictured it

417
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,914
after seeing all those
pictures online.

418
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:44,562
I've never seen
anything so beautiful.

419
00:20:44,572 --> 00:20:47,307
(chainsaw buzzing)

420
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:50,984
The best thing is I can get
locally-sourced monkey meat.

421
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:52,438
(hooting)

422
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,538
(shrieks)

423
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:57,172
Okay, Teeny. Take
care of part two.

424
00:20:57,532 --> 00:20:58,565
(gun cocks)

425
00:20:59,812 --> 00:21:01,858
(hooting, grunting)
