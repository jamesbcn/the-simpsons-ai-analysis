1
00:00:25,293 --> 00:00:28,396
There's something very,
very weird about this place.

2
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,998
Even the seagulls
have a New England accent.

3
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,604
Why did we vacation here?

4
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:39,207
It was on a list
of top ten places to see

5
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,342
before you mysteriously
disappear.

6
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,610
Fool.

7
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:45,079
This whole contest was a ruse.

8
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:46,514
What the...?

9
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,216
You are here to be sacrificed

10
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:51,519
to an evil god
from the ocean depths.

11
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,421
- SpongeBob?
- No!

12
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:56,457
The eternal lord of horror,
Cthulhu.

13
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:10,904
What the...?!

14
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,284
Wait just a minute!

15
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,953
I was promised
an eating contest,

16
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:27,955
and by the ancient law
of the flyer,

17
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,923
you have to provide me with one.

18
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:31,959
Very well.

19
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:37,465
An eating contest
against the monstrous Cthulhu?

20
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:41,969
To him, the Great Barrier Reef
is just an average barrier reef.

21
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:45,606
Well, my dad
didn't eat breakfast.

22
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,578
How you doing, Cthu?

23
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,346
Shut up, okay?

24
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,581
Just shut up.

25
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,250
I need to take a walk,
that's all.

26
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:59,320
I'll be fine.

27
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:02,490
I win. And I get
to name the prize.

28
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:03,824
Fine.

29
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:07,928
I'll give you whatever you want.

30
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,365
Immortal life? Whale watching
where you actually see a whale?

31
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:14,602
I know exactly what I want.

32
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,538
Oh, man.

33
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,611
Ooh, ink sac.

34
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:49,403
Now for a word from our late,
beloved Mapple founder,

35
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:52,740
Steve Mobs.

36
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,041
Hello.

37
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,545
And stop.

38
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,580
Since my unfortunate passing,

39
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,249
if things have gone
as I've planned,

40
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:03,684
Mapple is now
a trillion-dollar company,

41
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:07,187
Roseanne has come and gone
like a summer storm

42
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:10,658
and a less exciting version
of me has taken my place.

43
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,526
I'm wearing your pants, Steve.

44
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,263
And now I'm here to introduce
the new Myphone Ultima,

45
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:17,097
which comes
in the colors black...

46
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:21,335
slate gray...

47
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:24,104
and that's it.

48
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:32,346
The time has come.
Commence operations.

49
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,414
Can't they see you?

50
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,600
They see nothing.

51
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,522
This is too easy.

52
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,458
For you. You just look
at the monitor.

53
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:01,375
Lenny? My phone says
that there's spores

54
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:04,077
from outer space
landing all around us.

55
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:06,079
Well, my phone says there are
divorced moms in my area

56
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,615
that want to meet me.

57
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,227
Oh, great, an homage
to Body Snatchers,

58
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,596
which in itself was a rip-off
of The Thing.

59
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,633
This will be the last word
I ever say, C minus!

60
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,738
I want to return
this comic book.

61
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,741
The dialogue sounded forced
when I read it aloud.

62
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:37,578
I will help you, but first,
you are in danger.

63
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,614
You can crash at my pod,
I mean pad.

64
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:44,718
No one says pad anymore.
Run!

65
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,157
Dad, I'm worried.

66
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,825
Everyone's turning
into a zombie.

67
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:55,763
Thank God you're okay.

68
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,798
Mom! Something's wrong.

69
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:00,834
There is no escape.
We are all-powerful.

70
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:04,905
Boy, Maggie, you're carrying
a lot of anger towards Mom.

71
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,311
Chief, Chief, space plants
are eating everyone.

72
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:13,113
You're telling me.

73
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,615
Don't feel bad.

74
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,216
He was a lousy chief.

75
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,619
You know, my feelings
haven't dissolved yet, Lou.

76
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,888
Now, kids,
that's just air escaping.

77
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:23,857
You cannot stop us.

78
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:26,059
It is really
just a matter of...

79
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,796
How comes aliens
never use contractions?

80
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,064
We think it is scary.

81
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:36,269
It is why we call Jerry's Deli
the Deli of Jerry.

82
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,440
Conifer down.

83
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,247
I'm not a plant!

84
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,918
Prove it. Name the roster
of the Glasgow soccer club.

85
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,887
I don't, I don't know.
Is there a Rooney?

86
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:56,590
There's always a Rooney.

87
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:06,166
Bart, dystopian movies have
taught me two things.

88
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,337
A, you can make a four-part
movie from a three-part book,

89
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,573
and B, there is no hope.

90
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:15,375
So I'm saying good-bye
to you now, Bart.

91
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:16,677
Good-bye, sister.

92
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,713
The last sound you hear
will be...

93
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,133
<i>You don't win friends
with salad</i>

94
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,536
<i>You don't win friends
with salad...</i>

95
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,649
Congratulations,
fortunate Earth-being.

96
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:58,385
Welcome to your new paradise.

97
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,490
- Where are we?
- We're on a planet

98
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:05,759
in what you incorrectly call
the Crab Nebula.

99
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:08,562
You live
in the Crab Nebula. You.

100
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:11,298
Why would you kill me
and then bring me here?

101
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,601
We didn't kill you.
We have saved you.

102
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:16,236
When you were absorbed on Earth,
your consciousness

103
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:20,340
was transferred here
to this utopia.

104
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,009
Well, my daughter will be
very happy

105
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,811
living with you green beans.

106
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,513
She's a vegetarian.

107
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:26,614
Murderer.

108
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,115
Just kidding.

109
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,417
Have a piece of my ass.

110
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,753
So wait, wait, wait.

111
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,622
We're all pod people?

112
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,757
I'm afraid you were
already pod people.

113
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,626
What are you talking about?

114
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:42,129
iPod people, phone checkers,
tablet gazers.

115
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:45,432
Never lifting your petals
to see the sun.

116
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,535
Yes. Yes. This is perfect.

117
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:50,470
A sci-fi story
with a happy ending.

118
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,839
Now let us brag some more.

119
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,942
We are many,
but we move as one.

120
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,611
Finding out the best
of each other.

121
00:07:57,645 --> 00:08:00,881
Giving the love
that lets us go on.

122
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,482
Where'd you get those?

123
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,284
We just found them
wrapped under that guy.

124
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,986
It's what I do, man.
How you doing?

125
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,220
Herb Tannenbaum.

126
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,462
- He's waking up.
- Yes.

127
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,198
Is there anything
punching can't do?

128
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,635
It can't set a clock.

129
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,470
What's going on?

130
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,639
Where are we?

131
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:30,578
Who did this to us?

132
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,512
The last thing I remember

133
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:35,048
is crashing a sleepover
at Milhouse's.

134
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,485
I got to work.
So spend the night here.

135
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,220
But I'm not invited.

136
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:44,224
You think I was invited
on the Toledo Mud Hens team bus?

137
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:48,495
When I was asked to leave, my
left boob suddenly popped out.

138
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,230
That was a game-changer.

139
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,234
Then somebody
mysteriously sent

140
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,837
a case of orange drink,
which we drank.

141
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,341
You guys passed out,
and my first thought

142
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,376
was call the police.

143
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,680
But even heroes fall.

144
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,622
Lisa?

145
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,590
I'm not Lisa.

146
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:18,025
I'm Penelope.

147
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,559
Whassup?

148
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,528
Seriously, I want to know.

149
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,196
I'm the one
who brought you here

150
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,533
after drugging
your SunnyD with Special K

151
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,301
as in ketamine.

152
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,771
You K'd our D? You're crazy.

153
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,307
Crazy, you say?

154
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:36,076
Crazy.

155
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,145
Crazy!

156
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:41,481
Who are you calling crazy?

157
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,651
I'm not that loud.

158
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:46,553
I'm gonna belt you.

159
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:49,589
With a brassy Broadway tune.

160
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,393
<i>You'll be trapped</i>

161
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,228
<i>Trapped like rats</i>

162
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,231
<i>No one knows
where you're ats</i>

163
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,601
<i>You'll eat my shorts
then you'll have a cow</i>

164
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:04,604
<i>I'm gonna kick you now</i>

165
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:09,542
Applaud or die.

166
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,648
- You die, boys.
- What? Why?

167
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:16,784
Not one of you said encore.

168
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:20,320
But I think encores are
a ridiculous tradition.

169
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,990
Just sing your songs and go.

170
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,363
More pancakes, Lisa?

171
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,032
Pancakes are meaningless.

172
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,767
Life is meaningless.

173
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:35,435
Marge, Lisa's being unusual.

174
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,737
And where's Bart?

175
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,974
Oh, yes, the Simpson boy.

176
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:45,713
He called. He's staying with
the Milhouse for an extra day.

177
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,848
And the great thing
about boys is

178
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:50,718
that nothing bad
can ever happen to them.

179
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:56,323
Come on, Milhouse,
put your brain into it.

180
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,325
The door isn't even scratched.

181
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,527
Oh, we were trying
to break the door?

182
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,895
Okay, I got a plan.

183
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:04,197
First, Milhouse,
gnaw through your ankle.

184
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:08,969
I will,
but I'm allergic to myself.

185
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,972
I swear, if you say
one more wimpy thing...

186
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,407
Not my Gloria Vanderbilt
glasses.

187
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:17,644
They were on the cover
of Women's Health.

188
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,718
Lisa's wearing a dress.

189
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:26,887
All right, ya little beasties.

190
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,824
Are ye ready for a trip
to the Scottish Die-lands?

191
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:33,226
Just let yourselves out,

192
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,896
but beware the Beast!

193
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,831
Ah, isn't that cute?
She learned an accent

194
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,532
from Groundskeeper Willie.

195
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,434
Not that cute.

196
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:42,602
Ay caramba!

197
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,545
Wish I could burn
the calories off that easily.

198
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,182
You've got body issues.

199
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:06,526
It's time to recycle,
you stupid boys.

200
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,295
Careful, Lisa.

201
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,463
If you keep yelling like that,
you'll get vocal polyps

202
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:12,132
like Adele.

203
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:20,307
Please wear one of my bones
around your neck...

204
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:27,280
You missed.

205
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,488
What happened to you?

206
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:38,491
You know what you did!

207
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:57,110
Well, well, Little Miss Perfect.

208
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:59,512
I'm sure somebody changed this,
but I don't care.

209
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:05,618
You know, I never feel more like
a trademark corporate spokesman

210
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:08,188
than when I wake up
in an empty bed.

211
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,623
You can never make me feel
as good as this.

212
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,659
Oh, no!

213
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:17,965
You ruined Lisa's life
and on that day,

214
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:21,334
the Beast was born!

215
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:32,679
One American creates
this much garbage in one day.

216
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:35,515
Oh, just kill me.
Don't teach me.

217
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,984
I'm your brother.

218
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:42,389
If you have a great speech
to save yourself,

219
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,991
now would be the time.

220
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,625
I'm rooting for ya.

221
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,527
Lis, please forgive me.

222
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,997
I'm your big brother.
I'll always be there for you.

223
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,531
When your boyfriend dumps you,

224
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,134
I'll take you drinking
and tell you what a jerk he was.

225
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,503
When he takes you back,
I'll tell you he's great

226
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:57,905
and go to games with him.

227
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,706
I'll humanize
your campaign biography.

228
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:00,908
Am I reaching you?

229
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,243
It worked.

230
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,511
I'm back.

231
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:05,845
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

232
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,580
Why'd you do it, sweetie?

233
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:12,485
Sometimes, Mom, a woman gets
pushed so far, she just snaps.

234
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,488
You know how that feels,
don't you? Don't you?

235
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,490
No, not at all.

236
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,758
Where's Dad?

237
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,493
Tied up in the trunk of the car.

238
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,930
How am I supposed to know
the day we got married

239
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:25,032
falls on our wedding
anniversary?

240
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:28,035
Always wanted to be a paper boy.

241
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,403
You know, you're cute this way.

242
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:33,540
Have a perfume sample.

243
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,217
So, Smithers, what do you think?

244
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:48,021
I'll rejuvenate the elderly
using untested dinosaur DNA.

245
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:51,624
It could make me a fortune or
fill the world with monsters.

246
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:54,294
It could make me a fortune.

247
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,484
Why do you need doors?

248
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,487
You could just
fly over the wall.

249
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,823
- Damn it.
- I hope Grandpa's happy

250
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,326
in this new retirement home.

251
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,728
I'm sure he's happier here

252
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,064
is what we'll always say
about old people

253
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,665
no matter where we put them.

254
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,642
There's something weird
about this place...

255
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,944
that doesn't show up
on any map.

256
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:47,480
Oh, Lisa, you're always
so suspicious.

257
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,682
Welcome to Geriatric Park

258
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:53,120
where our motto is,
no further questions.

259
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:56,323
Here at Geriatric Park,
we combine

260
00:15:56,356 --> 00:16:00,460
speculative theories
with untested technologies

261
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:04,431
to give our seniors
a better life.

262
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,799
Possible side effects include
back spikes, protective plates,

263
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,535
giant claws, fear of asteroids,

264
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,503
being a precursor
to our modern birds,

265
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:12,872
a second tail brain, loss
of ears and increased libido.

266
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,042
If you are currently egg-laying
or expect to be egg-laying,

267
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,177
consult your paleontologist.

268
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,413
Now, meet your Jurassic
perked-up loved ones.

269
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,553
<i>They were old</i>

270
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:29,622
<i>They were sad</i>

271
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:34,627
<i>And their joints all hurt</i>

272
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,497
<i>Now they're here</i>

273
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,367
<i>And they're glad</i>

274
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,472
<i>They've hit pay dirt</i>

275
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,641
<i>Geriatric Park</i>

276
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,211
<i>Geriatric Park</i>

277
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:56,015
<i>It's so, so safe</i>

278
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,885
<i>Nothing can go wrong</i>

279
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,354
<i>Can go wrong, can go wrong</i>

280
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,723
<i>Can go wrong...</i>

281
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:08,395
Abe, I've never seen you
so vibrant and alive.

282
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:10,363
Well, I don't like to complain.

283
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:11,864
Wow, you have changed.

284
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,601
But they keep it
a little cold here.

285
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:17,670
Anything for you, Dad.

286
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,073
Don't want to read.
I'm on vacation.

287
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:34,954
What's happening?

288
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,556
Someone has raised
the temperature.

289
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,358
Let's take a look
at the microscopic level

290
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,859
with the peephole
and the twisty thing

291
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,095
and the little slide of glass.

292
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,983
You even taste disappointing.

293
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,585
Half of that taste is you.

294
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,601
Dang it.

295
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,923
You can't kill me.

296
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,692
I'm your creator,
for flaving out loud.

297
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:51,598
Credit hog.

298
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,901
You were listed
in the footnotes. Oy.

299
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,539
Oh, we're saved.

300
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,716
It's my mom.

301
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,618
In the best mood
we've ever seen her.

302
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,553
It's raining.

303
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,021
The old people will head
to the TV room

304
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:16,556
and watch
The Weather Channel.

305
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:19,626
That's not rain.
It's Grampa.

306
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,032
Lisa, no!

307
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:31,304
Sorry, I just believe in the
ultimate, basic goodness of people.

308
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,573
Grampa, I don't think
you want to hurt me.

309
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:36,409
You just want me
to see you as a person,

310
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:41,013
not some strange, scary monster
we call a senior citizen.

311
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:44,584
Grampa, I want
to hear your opinion

312
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,986
about everything.

313
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,389
She's making
the ultimate sacrifice.

314
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,391
Getting him started.

315
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,429
Grampa.

316
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,867
I still love you.

317
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,404
All they wanted
was to be cherished.

318
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:07,674
They've even learned how to get
respect from the orderlies.

319
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,242
I don't care
if you haven't finished.

320
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:11,678
I'm off the clock.

321
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:15,014
And once again, the true
monster, the soulless CEO,

322
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,049
escapes unscathed.

323
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,853
Oy. Too rich for my blood.

324
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,624
That was a lovely visit.

325
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,058
Although, I could've done

326
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,060
without some
of the decapitations.

327
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:31,264
Mom, where's the pilot?

328
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:34,033
Virgin Air I'm not.
