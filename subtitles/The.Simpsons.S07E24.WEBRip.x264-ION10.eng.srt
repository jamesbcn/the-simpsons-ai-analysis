00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,418
Your teacher--
four dozen rock bands.

178
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,924
So get ready for some
well-supervised craziness

179
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,257
while you rock out
with your father.

180
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,342
Whoo-hoo!

181
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,768
Wow. It's like Woodstock

182
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,226
only with advertisements
everywhere

183
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,816
and tons of security guards.

184
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,741
People, have your tickets out.

185
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,319
Throw your cameras out.

186
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,954
Surrender all identification.

187
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,203
Oh, my homemade Kahlua.

188
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,535
Generation "X" may be shallow,

189
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,501
but at least they have
tolerance and respect

190
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,711
for all people.

191
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,500
Hey, a freak show.

192
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,920
(barking)

193
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,589
-Ow! Aah!
-(crowd cheering)

194
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,506
Thank you. Thank you very much.

195
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,465
And now the band
you've all been waiting for--

196
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,596
Cypress Hill!

197
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,353
-Yeah!
-Before we start,

198
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,936
we have a lost child here.

199
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,941
If she's not claimed
within the next hour,

200
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,613
she will become property
of Blockbuster Entertainment.

What is that smell?

205
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,331
It smells like Otto's jacket.

206
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,500
-Dude, karma.
-What?

207
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,915
Karma. Karma.

208
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,884
Oh, I get it.

209
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,386
Dad, you cannot wear that.

210
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,299
That's a Rastafarian hat.

211
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,638
Hey, I've been safari-ing
since before you were born.

212
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,194
Wearing a Jamaican hat
makes a bold statement

213
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,149
about your connection
to reggae music.

214
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,979
Well, excuse me!

215
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,824
You know what, Dad?

216
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,362
Maybe we'll go exploring

217
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,405
on our own for a while.

218
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,319
Well, Homer, this is it.

219
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,618
Time to get back
with the people--

220
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,082
the young people.

221
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,920
All right! Yeah!

222
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,579
Cool concert, am I right?

223
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,787
-Yeah, nice try, narc.
-Where's a narc?

224
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,957
-Who?
-That fat Jamaican guy.

225
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,626
What'd I say?
What's goin' on?

226
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,625
Hey, we're just trying
to have a good time, narc.

227
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,718
Why do you want
to destroy us?

228
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,853
Don't commit your
hate crimes here.

229
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,270
Hate crime!

230
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,228
Okay, I'm heading out now.

231
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,559
More butt support.

232
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,443
More butt support.

233
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,650
D'oh!

234
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,400

243
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,631
but this music is really
getting to the crowd.

244
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,974
Eh, making teenagers depressed

245
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,089
is like shooting fish

248
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,020
Makes no sense.

249
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,849
I haven't changed
since high school,

250
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,984
and suddenly I'm uncool.

251
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,443
I've been kicked
out of paradise.

252
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:52,863
-(snorts)
-I'll never be part of the scene again.

253
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,864
(powering up)

254
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,446
Uh-oh.

255
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,579
(grunts)

256
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,115
Aw, man. There goes
Peter Frampton's big finale.

257
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,998
He's going to be pissed off.

258
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,125
You're damn right,
I'm going to be pissed off.

259
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,462
I bought that pig
at Pink Floyd's yard sale.

260
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,297
Dad, are you okay?

261
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,633
I'm fine.

262
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,797
(murmuring)

263
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,846
Sir, I run
Hullabalooza's Pageant

264
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:22,851
of the Transmundane--

265
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,392
the freak show.

266
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,385
And I've been looking
for a big fatso

267
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,187
to shoot with a cannon.

268
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,820
I'd like very much
for you to be that fatso.

269
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,901
So, you want
to go on tour

270
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,526
with a traveling
freak show.

271
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,534
I don't think I have
a choice, Marge.

272
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,866
-Of course, you have a choice.
-How do you figure?

273
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,832
You don't have to join
a freak show

274
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,422
just because the opportunity
came along.

275
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:51,038
You know, Marge, in some ways
you and I are very different people.

276
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,167
(cheering)

277
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,467
MAN (over P.A.): <i>And now,</i>

281
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,307
Hi, everybody.

282
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,555
Is everybody--

283
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,317
(feedback)

284
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,399
...good?

285
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,276
(grunts)

286
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,619
(cheering)

287
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,075
Thank you.

288
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,285
Thank you very much.

289
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,716
"Stay in school.

290
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,678

00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,139
(thud)

292
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,548
Hey, Cannonball,
I like your statement.

293
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,887
When life takes a cheap shot at you,
you stand your ground.

294
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,733
Billy Corgan,
Smashing Pumpkins.

295
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,438
Homer Simpson,
smiling politely.

296
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,309
You know, my kids
think you're the greatest.

297
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,056
And thanks to
your gloomy music,

298
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,818
they've finally
stopped dreaming

299
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,070
of a future I can't
possibly provide.

300
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,862
Well, we try to make
a difference.

301
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,158
"Dear Bart and Lisa..."

302
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
HOMER:

00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,286
<i>Our first job is to entertain.</i>

00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,133
-(grunts)
-(cheering)

306
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,210
<i>And I like to think sometimes</i>

307
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,126

308
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,048
(cheering)

309
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,137
<i>But the main thing is,</i>

310
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,433
<i>I've finally tapped into that</i>
<i>spirit of self-destruction</i>

311
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:34,268
<i>that makes rock 'n' roll</i>
<i>the king of music.</i>

312
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,355
(cheering)

313
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,361
Whoo-hoo!

314
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,236
Hello, ticket holders!

315
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,118
Oh, here comes
that cannonball guy.

316
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,502
He's cool.

317
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,658
Are you being sarcastic, dude?

318
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,537
I don't even know anymore.

319
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,551

320
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:02,009
(cheering)

321
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,381
Thank you!

322
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,797
And remember!

323
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,555
Don't trust anyone over 30!

324
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,138
And now, Peter Frampton!

325
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,024
(cheering)

326
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,561
Thanks, Homer.

327
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,024
Homer Simpson, everyone!

328
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,435
(strikes chord)

329
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,324
Hey, Homer, looks
like our next stop

330
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,901
is your hometown,
Springfield.

331
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,736
Is it true that we have
to bring our own water?

332
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,322
We got a little
rule back home.

333
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,827
If it's brown,
drink it down.

334
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,828
If it's black,
send it back.

335
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,700
The hometown show's
the big one, Homer.

336
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,827
Yeah. People who called
you a weirdo in high school

337
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,334
get to see what a successful
freak you've become.

338
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,837
Hey, I wasn't a weirdo.

339
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,588
I was in the audio-visual club.

340
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,921
Really? Me too.

341
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,546
But I got kicked out

342
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,932
'cause of my views
on Vietnam.

343
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,760
Also, I was stealing
projectors.

344
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,256
Anyway...

345
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,717
get ready, beer belly.

346
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,427
We're going
to show Springfield

347
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,517
what we're made of.

348
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,063
All right, Homer!
Yeah!

349
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,056
(echoey belch)

350
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,818
That was odd.

351
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,820
Gee, I don't like
the sound of that.

352
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,152
(echo)

353
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,946
No biggie. I'm cool.

354
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,620
Homer, nothing's more
important to me

355
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,078
than the health and
well-being of my freaks.

356
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,079
I'm sending you to a vet.

357
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,871
My, God.
Those cannonballs

358
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,035
have practically demolished
your stomach.

359
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:20,424
From now on, no cannonballs,
no spicy foods.

360
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,052
And when you lie
in a hammock,

361
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,299
please, rest your
beer on your head

362
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,841
or your genitals.

363
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,635
(scoffs)
Rules. I'm a rocker.

364
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,258
I don't care for rules.

365
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,755
Mr. Simpson,
this is serious.

366
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,557
If you take one more
cannonball to the gut,

367
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,022
you will die.

368
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,649
Die?

369
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,689
Well, you don't scare me, Doc,

370
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:45,113
'cause dying would be
a stone groove.

371
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,784
Got any messages
for Jimi Hendrix?

372
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,373
Yes. Pick up your puppy.

373
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,668
BART: So, what's it like
being famous, Dad?

374
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,959
HOMER: People know your
name, but you don't know theirs.

375
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,463
It's great.

376
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,514
Dad, do you wear boxers
or briefs?

377
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,799
-Nope.
-What religion are you?

378
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,803
You know, the one with
all the well-meaning rules

379
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,096
that don't work out
in real life. Uh...

380
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,970
Christianity.

381
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,517
What's with all
the questions?

382
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,890
Just some report
I gotta do for school.

383
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,517
Hey, you want some pie?

384
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,903
Sure. We got a lot
of catching up to do.

385
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,818
Hmm...

386
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,779
(rumbling)

387
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,797
Clear the way,
clear the way.

388
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,170
Performer coming through.

389
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,677
This is so exciting.

390
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,638
Last time I got
to go backstage

391
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,639
was when Bart ripped his pants
at the Christmas play.

392
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,601
-Mom!
-Ha-ha!

393
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:05,231
Hello, bands. Who is playing with
the London Symphony Orchestra?

394
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:09,065
Come on, people. Somebody ordered
the London Symphony Orchestra--

395
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,573
possibly while high.

396
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:15,365
Cypress Hill,
I'm looking in your direction.

397
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,241
Hey, man, did we
order a orchestra?

398
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,657
(whispering)
What's up with this orchestra?

399
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,076
(whispering)
Where'd the orchestra come from?

400
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,584
I don't know, man.

401
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,705
They didn't tell me
about this, man.

402
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,501
We got to do something.

403
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,795
Uh, oh, yeah, yeah,
we think we did.

404
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,339
Uh, do you know
"Insane in the Brain"?

405
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,723
(British accent):
We mostly know classical,

406
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,550
but we could give it a shot.

407
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,595
(hip-hop beat playing)

408
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,808

00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,647

Hey, my shoes
are talking too.

416
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,459
Don't worry.

417
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,591
We won't hurt you.

418
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:10,458
We only want

419
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,757
(chuckling)

420
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,260
And to think, Smithers,

421
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,182
you laughed when I
bought Ticketmaster.

422
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,431
"Nobody's going to pay
a 100% service charge."

423
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,345
Well, it's a policy that
ensures a healthy mix

424
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,564
of the rich
and the ignorant, sir.

426
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,942

Do you feel!

432
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,287
God. Homer Simpson wrecks
my pig,

433
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,293
Cypress Hill steals
my orchestra,

434
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,705
and Sonic Youth's
in my cooler!

435
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,504
Get out of there,
you kids!

436
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,337
{\an8}Aw, come on, Mr. Frampton.

437
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,342
{\an8}You're not going to eat
all that watermelon.

438
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,474
Please.
I'm trying to perform.

439
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,013
Go ahead.

440
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,176
We'll stay here and
guard your cooler.

441
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,274
Oh, 25 years I've been in this.

442
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,430
I've never heard
anything like...

443
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,148
(crowd cheering)

444
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,808
And now, Springfield,

445
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,896
this is the moment
that you've been waiting for.

446
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:15,703
The man who embodies everything
about rock 'n roll, except the music--

447
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,869
Give it up for your
very own homegrown hero...

448
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:23,199
-Homer Simpson!
-(cheering)

449
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,077
I used to carpool
with that guy.

450
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,464
Oh, this is heavy.

451
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,713
Okay, Homer,
don't fear the reaper.

452
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,456
(stomach rumbling)

453
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,798
Oh, I'm going to die.

454
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,803
Cannons are designed
to hurt.

455
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,046
They're designed to hurt.

456
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,138
Shh! Mom, Dad needs our support.

457
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,653
You're the coolest Dad alive.

458
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,452
(drum roll)

459
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,368
(gasps)

460
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,293
(crowd gasping)

461
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,173
(crowd jeering)

462
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,973
Oh, Marge,
I thought I had

463
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,010
an appetite for destruction,

464
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,643
but all I wanted was
a club sandwich.

465
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,891
There might be one
in this cooler.

466
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,563
Oh, here we go.

467
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,642
Ohh!

468
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,846
Aw, man. Homer wussed out.

469
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,307
I'm so disillusioned.

470
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,106
Hey, Hullabalooza
isn't about freaks.

471
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,321
It's about music
and advertising

472
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,991
and youth-oriented
product positioning.

473
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,031
That and getting toasted--
nicely toasted.

474
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,775
Homer, I'm sorry.

475
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,827
There's nothing worse
than a yellow-bellied freak,

476
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,412
unless that's his act.

477
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,537
I expect your letter
of resignation on my desk.

478
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:54,214
-You have a desk?
-No, I mean, the hood of my car.

479
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:58,174
I'll miss you, Pumpkins, but I just
can't share your bleak world view.

480
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,127
I've got too much
to live for.

481
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,717
We envy you, Homer.
All we have is our music,

482
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,813
our legions of fans,
our millions of dollars,

483
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:05,808
and our youth.

484
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,676
Whoo-hoo!

485
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,227
Let's all go out
and buy fur coats!

486
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,771
I want a walk-in
humidor.

487
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,150
So, I realized that
being with my family

488
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,566
is more important
than being cool.

489
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,865
Dad, what you just said
was powerfully uncool.

490
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,580
You know what
the song says:

491
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,160
"It's hip to be square."

492
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,156
That song is so lame.

493
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,748
So lame that it's... cool?

494
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,754
-No.
-No.

495
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,995
Am I cool, kids?

496
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:36,996
-No.
-No.

497
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,587
Good. I'm glad.

498
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,012
And that's what makes me cool--
not caring, right?

499
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,301
-No.
-No.

500
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,264
Well, how the hell
do you be cool?

501
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,184
I feel like we've tried
everything here.

502
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,603
Wait, Marge.
Maybe if you're truly cool,

503
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,273
you don't need
to be told you're cool.

504
