Well, Seymour, it seems
we've put together a baseball team,

Yes, not the pronoun but rather a player

of "Who" is on first.

But, Mom, I read that sport
utility vehicles are more likely

178
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,155
to be involved in fatal accidents.

179
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,707
Fatal to the people in the other car.

180
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,630
Let's roll.

181
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,208
Hang on, the manual says

182
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,303
I need to log on to the onboard computer.

183
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,469
M-A-R-G-E.

184
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,928
FEMALE VOICE: <i>Hello, Marge. </i>

185
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,588
<i>Where would you like to go today?</i>

186
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,176
(gasps)

187
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,851
No one has ever asked me that
before in my life.

188
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,474
(tires screeching)

189
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,812
Well, that's a first.

190
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,733
I've never been able
to fit 32 grocery bags

191
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,022
into one car before.

192
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:47,236
Eww, why is Courtney Love
on the Wheaties box?

193
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,358
Hmm. I thought it was Sandy Duncan.

194
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,065
Uh-oh. Gridlock at 12 o'clock.

195
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:54,445
(horns honking)

196
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,076
Oh, crud.

197
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,213
And we're so close to the house.

198
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,040
Um, I don't want to alarm you,

199
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,285
but the ice cream's starting to go south.

200
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,088
(slurping)

201
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:11,052
Hmm. Mm-hmm. (gagging)

202
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,433
Hey, give me some of that.

203
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,390
(screams)

204
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,179
Mom, Bart sprayed whipped cream in my eye!

205
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,394
I did not.

206
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,313
(screams)

207
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,771
(both grunting)

208
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,980
(yelling)

209
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,190
Kids, cut it out!

210
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,901
(sighs) All right.

211
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:25,941
Hey!

212
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,443
Come on, Mom, just cut across the field.

213
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:32,066
Oh, I don't know. It doesn't seem right.

214
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,284
Huh! Do you want to spend
your whole life doing what's right?

215
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,025
Of course not.

216
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,914
Let's do it.

217
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,746
(man singing country music)

218
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,542
(tires screeching)

219
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,455
BART: Whoa!

220
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,133
You the man, Mom!

221
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,751
Out of my way, nature!

222
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,168
(panicked chittering)

223
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,300
MARGE: <i>♪ Canyonero! ♪ </i>

224
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,930
(gasps)

225
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,980
Look at me, Lis.
I'm Baron von Chickenpants.

226
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,402
(clucking)

227
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,531
Bart, that's tomorrow night's dinner.

228
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,359
You're tomorrow night's dinner.

229
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:15,364
Mom! Bart took what I said
and turned it into an insult!

230
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,118
That's nice, dear.

231
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,619
OK, Mr. Peanut,
you think you can keep...

232
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,294
(stammering)

233
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,423
A three-chambered peanut.

234
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,210
Marge, look what I did!

235
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,174
Come quick! Hurry!

236
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,264
Marge?

237
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,553
Marge?

238
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,887
Marge, you've been out there all morning.

239
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,929
-So?
-So lying on the couch and eating stuff

240
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,024
isn't the same
if you aren't around to see it.

241
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,439
I'll come watch you
do nothing after I try out

242
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:47,558
my new high-intensity halogen headlights.

243
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,441
(snickering)

244
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,066
Nobody will ever cut me off again.

245
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,374
Oh, please come in.

246
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,278
Maggie smells bad,
and the cat wants something

247
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,408
but I don't know what.

248
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,825
I'm almost done.

249
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,463
And tell Bart to get out of my purse.

250
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,253
(inaudible dialogue)

251
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,681
MARGE: SUV. Coming through.

252
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,760
Open up for Marge.

253
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:20,885
Thank you.

254
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,891
Thank... Whoa.

255
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,733
And daylight. Come on. Come on.

256
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,810
(horn honking)

257
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,274
Jeez, try the gas pedal, grandma.

258
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,475
It's right there next to the brake.

259
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,435
Oh, for god's sake. Go back to New Jersey.

260
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,952
(exasperated grunting)

261
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,575
-(horn honking)
-Come on! Come on!

262
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,163
Get that corpse off the road!

263
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,458
The streets are for the living.

264
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,882
-(tires screeching)
-(people screaming)

265
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,090
Slow down, you maniac!

266
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,420
Show some respect
for this coffin full of bricks

267
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,296
representing a young man lost at sea!

268
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,049
Hey!

269
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,467
(siren wails)

270
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,104
Oh, great. What'd I do?

271
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,191
This better be important.

272
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,571
Can the sweet talk, Thelma and Louise.

273
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,648
You have a serious mental illness.

274
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,654
The technical term is "road rage."

275
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,657
I'll see you tomorrow morning
at traffic school, speedy.

276
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,450
And you got exactly five seconds
to get out of my sight.

277
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,544
LISA: Oh.

278
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,328
(tires screeching)

279
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,422
Oh, why are the pretty ones always insane?

280
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,052
OK, I assume you all know
why you're here.

281
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,514
That's right.

282
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,302
-You're all angry sick people.
-(grumbling)

283
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,886
But over these next eight hours,

284
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,682
you will be broken down
to the level of infants,

285
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,847
then rebuilt as functional members of
society,

286
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,896
then broken down again, then lunch,

287
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,691
then, if there's time, rebuilt once more.

288
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,856
All right, roll it, Lou.

289
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,369
<i>Hello. I'm Sergeant Crew,</i>

290
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,080
<i>and I'm here to talk to you about...</i>

291
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,366
<i>road... rage.</i>

292
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,786
-Duh.
-Quiet, fatso. The sergeant's talking.

293
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,376
Go on, dear.

294
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,461
<i>In these modern hectic days of fast food,</i>

295
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,967
<i>answering machines, and one-night stands,</i>

296
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,050
<i>people are getting angrier.</i>

297
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,345
<i>Now, what you're about</i>
<i>to see is not pretty.</i>

298
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,429
<i>Cut me off, will ya?</i>

299
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,518
<i>Yah!</i>

300
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,732
(grunting)

301
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,022
(horn honking)

302
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,074
<i>Learn to drive, dimwit!</i>

303
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,820
<i>I sentence you to kiss my ass!</i>

304
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,452
(screaming)

305
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,740
<i>Look familiar? It should.</i>

306
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,914
<i>Anger is what makes America great,</i>

307
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,202
<i>but you must find</i>
<i>the proper outlet for your rage.</i>

308
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,457
<i>Fire a weapon at your television screen,</i>

309
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,750
<i>pick a fight with someone weaker than you,</i>

310
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,964
<i>or write a threatening letter</i>
<i>to a celebrity.</i>

311
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,205
<i>So, when you go out for a drive,</i>

312
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,757
<i>remember to leave your murderous anger</i>
<i>where it belongs...</i>

313
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,683
<i>at home.</i>

314
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,385
(applause)

315
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,432
And, as if that film wasn't enough,

316
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,016
we have a special guest.

317
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,481
Why, it's Curtis E. Bear--

318
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,402
The Courtesy Bear.

319
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,190
(hums)

320
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,824
For the next three hours,

321
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,700
this bear will take
your verbal and physical abuse

322
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,488
with good nature and aplomb.

323
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:28,032
So, if you'll all just grab
one of these two-by-fours...

324
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,117
Uh, Chief, can I
at least shield my crotch?

325
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,123
Bears can't talk, Kenny.

326
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,495
-(yelling) Oh, yeah!
-(Kenny groaning)

327
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,205
(indistinct chatter)

328
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,296
Well, Simpson, did you learn
something today?

329
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,551
Oh, did I ever.

330
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,223
And that herbal anger rinse

331
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,642
just washed the rage right out of me.

332
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,848
Uh, remember, Midge,
you feel the need to rage,

333
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,062
you call me, right?

334
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,392
I won't even get sexual or nothing

335
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,647
unless that's what you want.

336
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,016
But that's not what you want, right?

337
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,516
No, thanks.

338
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,527
But thanks.

339
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,413
(indistinct chatter)

340
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,991
After you, sweetheart.

341
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,044
Oh, no, you first, ma'am.

342
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,538
Well, somebody go first.

343
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,661
Well, not me.

344
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,327
I'm not going until she goes.

345
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,745
Oh, for crying out loud, I...

346
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,214
Oh, oh, oh, OK. Calm down.

347
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,545
Just think.

348
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,260
What would Curtis E. Bear do?

349
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,631
(honking)

350
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,837
Move it, I got to return this suit!

351
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,348
(tires squealing)

352
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,890
Hmm.

353
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,685
Get out of the way!

354
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,899
(tires squealing)

355
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,518
Oh, no! No!

356
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,186
(horn honking)

357
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,324
(screams)

358
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,532
-Yaaah!
-(alarm blaring)

359
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,203
We're free! We're free!

360
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,369
Whoa. Thanks, chick dude.

361
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,912
Well, I hope you're happy, Simpson.

362
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,785
Those prisoners were one day away

363
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,042
from being completely rehabilitated.

364
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,094
I'm tearing up your license.

365
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,457
Aw, jeez. Darned laminated...

366
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,048
Would you mind? I got stubby fingers.

367
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,893
(embarrassed chuckle)

368
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,639
(groans)

369
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:14,847
(frustrated grunt)

370
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,312
How could they take away my license?

371
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,273
It feels like I lost a limb.

372
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,733
Well, that's a turnoff.

373
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,483
Hey, why don't you come
to the wild animal park with us?

374
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,435
No. Your father drives like an old lady.

375
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,107
At least I've got a license.

376
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,735
(grunts)

377
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,572
(quietly): Come on, kids. I went too far.

378
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,827
-(door slams)
-(sighs)

379
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,331
(elephant trumpets)

380
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,956
Aw, what a gyp.
They're all just lying around.

381
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,174
Do something!

382
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,724
Bart, they're not here to entertain us.

383
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:51,008
I've seen plays that were
more exciting than this.

384
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,353
Honest to god. Plays!

385
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,350
I don't want to pay four bucks to watch
some monkey wannabe laying in the sun!

386
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,604
But, Dad, lemurs are nocturnal.

387
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,606
Don't worry, honey.
Daddy will fix that broken animal.

388
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,769
No!

389
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,567
I'm not going to hurt him.
I'm just going to wake him up.

390
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,111
(shrieking)

391
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,074
(shrieks)

392
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,366
(roars, growls)

393
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,041
(all growl)

394
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,044
Uh-oh. Here's your slingshot, Lisa!

395
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,171
I told them a chain-link fence
wouldn't hold rhinos.

396
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,966
Oh, wait. No, I didn't.

397
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,180
I meant to tell them.

398
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,437
(shrieks)

399
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,280
(screaming)

400
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,032
(all screaming)

401
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,584
Don't worry, kids. I know just what to do.

402
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,159
Jumanji!

403
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,504
(roaring)

404
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,832
Does anything from
the movies actually work?

405
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,955
(grunting)

406
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,840
Aw, nuts.

407
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,672
Isn't there anybody who can round up
these thunder lizards?

408
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,258
Well, they'd need a pretty rugged vehicle.

409
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,184
And a heart to match.

410
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,182
Hmm.

411
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,813
I'd like to help you, Chief,

412
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,520
but my license was revoked.

413
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,100
Seems I'm full of rage.

414
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,515
Then do it for this adorable little puppy.

415
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,606
Look at the puppy, Marge.

416
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,781
That's your hat.

417
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,150
She's good, Chief.

418
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,197
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got some dust

419
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,370
that needs busting.

420
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,663
(people screaming)

421
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,332
<i>This is Kent Brockman at the scene</i>

422
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,500
<i>of a level-three rhino alert.</i>

423
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,709
Authorities say there's
no immediate danger to anyone

424
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,711
except those three luckless people
whom we'll identify

425
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,214
once the rhinos spit out their wallets.

426
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,166
(gasps)

427
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,086
Back! Back, I say!

428
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,721
Oh, no. I'm out of popcorn.

429
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,264
Throw your peanuts!

430
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,847
You throw your peanuts.

431
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,312
(all yelling)

432
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,768
-(horn honking)
-BART: Look, it's Mom.

433
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,105
Out of the way!

434
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,439
-(horn honking)
-Move it or lose it!

435
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,694
Get going, you!

436
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,065
(horn honking)

437
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,241
This ought to hold them.

438
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,624
There's one missing, mate.

439
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,001
If we don't find him,
it'll be my ass on the barbie.

440
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,538
-(grunting snorts)
-(whimpering)

441
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,171
(horn honking)

442
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,460
Get in! Get in!

443
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,674
(grunting)

444
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,423
Come on, Homer, jump!

445
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,625
(grunts)

446
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:39,085
Ohh, when will Detroit build
a sunroof for the husky gentleman?

447
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,428
-(growling)
-(Lisa gasps)

448
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:41,808

00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,022
-(growling)
-(Homer grunting)

450
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,639
(screaming) Oh, no!

451
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:51,978
-(whimpering)
-(people screaming)

452
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,145
Hey, anybody seen Homer today?

453
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,944
-(screaming)
-There he goes.

454
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,028
Oh! Ow!

455
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,282
It's not my rhino!

456
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,832
(all scream)

457
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,832
(grunts)

458
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,906
(screams)

459
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,326
Ooh!

460
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,247
Oh, thank you, God!

461
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,634
And thank you, Port-A-John.
You really saved my...

462
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,672
(screams)

463
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,755
Who's out there?

464
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,756
(screams)

465
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,642
Oh, I'm going to die.

466
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,099
Jesus, Allah, Buddha, I love you all!

467
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:25,718
(growls)

468
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,177
HOMER: Nice rhino.

469
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,017
(tires squealing)

470
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,862
(gasps)

471
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,275
Oh, no! She's not going to make it!

472
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,861
Hmm. Looks like it's time for plan B.

473
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,778
One, two,

474
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,906
three... B!

475
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,535
(shrieks)

476
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,955
(growls)

477
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,839
It's OK, Homie. You can come out now.

478
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,842
HOMER: Uh, give me a minute.

479
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,009
(rhino grunting)

480
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,055
Oh, Marge, you saved me.

481
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:11,021
Wow. You are so much cooler
than Milhouse's mom.

482
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,113
Yeah, way to channel that rage, Simpson.

483
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,398
How did you know
your plan would work, Mom?

484
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,112
Thanks for asking.

485
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,862
Well, I was watching <i>Dateline, </i>

486
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,784
and Stone Phillips said
SUVs always roll over

487
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,123
when you turn sharply

488
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,698
and the gas tanks explode
at the drop of a hat.

489
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,794
And she also knew,
if a rhino sees a flame,

490
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,040
he'll instinctively try to put it out.

491
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,923
Stone Phillips again.

492
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,340
Is there anything that guy doesn't know?

493
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,259
Why, this Stone Phillips
sounds like quite a bloke.

494
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,378
What television network is he on?

495
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,425
Why, NBC, of course.

496
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,299
NBC has lots of great shows

497
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,716
and their news and sports coverage
can't be beat.

498
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,635
Do you think there's anything great
on NBC right now?

499
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,635
Oh, I'm sure of it.

500
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,057
But there's only one way to find out.

501
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,147
HOMER: <i>I'd like to read</i>
<i>the following statement,</i>

502
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,862
<i>-but I do so under...</i>
<i>-(gun </i>cocks)

503
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,402
<i>...my own free will.</i>

504
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,735
<i>''It has come to my attention</i>
<i>that NBC sucks.</i>

505
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,321
<i>I apologize for misleading you</i>

506
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,156
<i>and urge you to watch</i>
<i>as many Fox shows as possible."</i>

507
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,582
<i>So, in summary, NBC bad, Fox good.</i>

508
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,542
<i>CBS great.</i>

00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,291
