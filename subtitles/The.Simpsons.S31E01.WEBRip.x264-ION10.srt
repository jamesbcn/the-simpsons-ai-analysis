1
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:10,011
D'oh!

2
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:13,881
Fold down that...

3
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:15,215
and then up that...

4
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:16,617
and this and over there

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,318
and you have a beautiful swan!

6
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:19,353
What the...?!

7
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:30,197
This is Anger Watkins, and
you're watching basic cable's

8
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,032
angriest sports show.

9
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,201
Folks, this is difficult to say,

10
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:36,637
but, today, I'm angry!

11
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,938
I like how angry he is.

12
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:39,673
I want to broach a topic

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,443
that no one else has
the airtime to fill to discuss.

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,178
Greatest of All Time.

15
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,180
LeBron, Kobe or MJ?

16
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,750
I'll tell you
why you're all wrong!

17
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,485
Let's open the lines.

18
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:52,920
The producer says
I'm gonna go on.

19
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,821
Please, Sports Jesus,

20
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,390
guide my blather.

21
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,025
Welcome to Rage Nation.

22
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,459
What the hell is your problem?

23
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,062
First-time listener,

24
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,463
long-time caller.

25
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,965
So, I...

26
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:06,199
Give me a take!

27
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,501
Anger needs a take.

28
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,469
Who is number one?

29
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:10,938
John Stockton!

30
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,339
John Stockton?!

31
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,541
We're trying to have
our daily conversation

32
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:18,111
in which we rank
and re-rank three demigods,

33
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,915
and you bring John "Never Won a Title"
Stockton into the mix?!

34
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:23,951
Shame! For shame!

35
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,652
Die! Soon!

36
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,687
Goodbye.

37
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:32,225
Homer, you got flushed.

38
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,061
A man who don't know sports,

39
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,929
he ain't much of a man.

40
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:37,097
You're nothing to me now.

41
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:40,000
Just a husband and father.

42
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,034
Stupid Anger Watkins

43
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,203
flushing me
with an audio effect.

44
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,206
Why not eat your feelings
with a cheer-up kebab?

45
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,408
Let's see. Pizza slice,

46
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,611
summer sausage...

47
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,448
Here you go.

48
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,117
It was only a dumb call-in show.

49
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,652
Easy for you to say.

50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,054
If that jerk
didn't like your sports notions,

51
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,756
listen to someone else.

52
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:05,192
The internet's full
of homemade sports shows.

53
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,960
Anyone could put one on,

54
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:08,695
- I mean, even...
- Don't say you.

55
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:09,696
Don't say you.

56
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:10,797
Even you.

57
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,132
Damn it.

58
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,767
Oh, yes. Of course!

59
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:16,069
An internet sports talk show!

60
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,537
But where could I find a host

61
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,339
who thinks
all my opinions are great?

62
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:22,175
Me.

63
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:25,612
Marge, prepare
a congratulations kebab.

64
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,724
These are hard as rocks.

65
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,393
Food fight!

66
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,233
This calls
for massive retaliation.

67
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,568
Use your quadratic equations,
men.

68
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,850
Oh, my God.
I'm having a flashback.

69
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:08,255
Good Lord, I'm reliving
the Tot Offensive.

70
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,557
Skinner...

71
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,292
I'll Heimlich you, sir.

72
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,695
Just be still so I can embrace
you from behind.

73
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:18,699
Get... off... me.

74
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,636
Shh, you're safe now.

75
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,511
Now, which of you little
hoodlums tossed the first tot?

76
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:32,979
- The nerd did it.
- Could be Lisa.

77
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,815
Principal Skinner, it wasn't me.
It was physics.

78
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,550
Is this true, Fizix?

79
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,553
I would've thought better of a
Turkemenistani exchange student.

80
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,822
I had nothing to do with it.

81
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:45,258
I came to this country
to escape food-based violence.

82
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,028
Lisa, one week's detention.

83
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,852
Welcome to Walkoff Homer!

84
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,120
This is Homer Simpson,

85
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,122
the rudest dude
on the InnerTube.

86
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,924
They say Muhammad Ali
was the greatest of all time,

87
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,927
but he never fought
Cassius Clay.

88
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,696
What was he afraid of?

89
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,498
Boom! Hot take.

90
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,133
And how come, in basketball,

91
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,135
they use the basket all the time

92
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,505
but you could literally play
football without any feet?

93
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,839
This show sucks.

94
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:36,209
I can't believe he's wasting
Flanders' Wi-Fi on this.

95
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,811
Here's a few things that bug me.

96
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,113
How can they call traveling
on a home team?

97
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,015
Why is soccer so stupid?

98
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,151
How can they play hockey
in a garden?

99
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,386
Why can't golfers carry
their own clubs?

100
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,954
Lazy jerks.

101
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,559
Moose Poo?!

102
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,361
Why, you hilarious...

103
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,872
Eat Sunset Rose!

104
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,674
Semi-gloss.

105
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:22,122
Seed bell?

106
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,891
Like that's gonna stop me.

107
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,197
Oh, so cute!

108
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,199
Look at...

109
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,301
Oh, my face! My face!

110
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,310
<i>Let's give 'em
something to talk about</i>

111
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,712
<i>Something to talk about</i>

112
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,515
<i>Let's give 'em
something to talk about</i>

113
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,953
What the hell's so funny?

114
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,229
We must come together...

115
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,997
to lower our carbon...

116
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,366
- Stupid boy.
- Dumb dad.

117
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:07,767
First, he ruins my life.

118
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:08,969
- Then he ruins my livestream.
- Me ruining his show was

119
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,670
- the only good part of his show.
- I'm gonna change the NHL

120
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,672
- with my idea...
- Fat goalie was his only good take.

121
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,808
- for morbidly obese goalies.
- Should've led with it.

122
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,044
Hello. #FirstImpression.

123
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,479
Oh, my God, a hipster!

124
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,881
Marge, bring him a microbrew!

125
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,482
- Quick!
- I'm on it!

126
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:30,223
The alluvial hops really bring
out the riparian bitterness.

127
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,591
He likes it.

128
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:33,460
- I think.
- I did like it.

129
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,228
My name's Warburton Parker.

130
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,564
I'm a stranger to you.
Why should you listen to me?

131
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:38,965
You don't know my backstory.

132
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,934
Well, here it is, colon,

133
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,970
as a child,
my only friend was my computer.

134
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,205
I was teased every day.

135
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:46,640
Then I became a pro snowboarder,

136
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,708
married a supermodel,
went into tech,

137
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,443
made a fortune,
bought the factories

138
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,846
where the kids who teased me's
parents worked

139
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,314
and shut the factories down.

140
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,715
Do you have a backstory?

141
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,951
Once, when I was six,
I ate a radio.

142
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,419
I like you,

143
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:00,987
but that won't get in the way.

144
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,355
Let me cut to the chase.

145
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,990
I make money from viral videos.

146
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,493
And you two have gone viral.

147
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,829
Raccoon in a revolving door viral.

148
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,869
You're right
to dance in such a fashion.

149
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,470
Because I'll show you
how to make videos

150
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,572
that will make you rich.

151
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,874
And me richer.

152
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,509
And me richest.

153
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,010
What are you doing here?

154
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:26,579
I get an alert
whenever anyone's getting rich.

155
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:35,121
Wow, 5.7 million views.

156
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,123
Wow! Good, not great.

157
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,925
That's the population
of Colorado.

158
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,460
Is that the Broncos one?

159
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,262
It is...

160
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:45,332
The question is,
how much money have you made?

161
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,334
Let's see.
Third quarter take...

162
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,102
- Factor in overhead.
- Of course.

163
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,503
- Overhead.
- Projections.

164
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,638
Apples to apples.

165
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,873
Figure net profit.

166
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,775
Got it. Nothing.

167
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,344
The question was rhetorical,
you idiots.

168
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,045
Sorry about the idiots thing.

169
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:02,949
But what you need to do
is monetize.

170
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:06,219
- Monetize! Monetize!
- Monetize! Monetize!

171
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,054
Monorail. Monorail.

172
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,956
Wait, what are we talking about?

173
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,592
Perhaps you are familiar

174
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,794
with the greatest viral video
of all time.

175
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,364
Monkey smells finger
and falls out of tree.

176
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,966
No, I've never seen...

177
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,104
Oh, my...

178
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,405
Oh, that monkey!

179
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,648
And the... the monkey!

180
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,652
He smelled his finger.

181
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,490
Then boom!

182
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,995
Smell.

183
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,631
That monkey
and that monkey's estate

184
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,700
made zero dollars.

185
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,702
Even less in monkey dollars.

186
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,070
If he had signed with me,

187
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,505
I mean, just hypothetically,

188
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,340
there would be,
oh, I don't know...

189
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:01,908
Monkey Finger Sniff T-shirts,

190
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,910
Monkey Finger Sniff
Finger Wipes,

191
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:05,678
Monkey Finger Sniff sponsorships

192
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,448
and a spot
on Weekend Update on SNL.

193
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,750
Host, Rami Malek or better.

194
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,452
Musical guest, Pitbull.

195
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,922
What this monkey didn't sniff
was opportunity.

196
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,058
In the next five minutes,
you'll get more views

197
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,893
than the entire
rebooted Murphy Brown.

198
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,494
Such high hopes.

199
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,896
Not the same without Eldin.

200
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,932
Now, this fight, you're
gonna get kickback from...

201
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,134
- Duff Beer?
- Look at your shirt.

202
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,774
Label to camera.

203
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,042
Hey, label to camera.

204
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,283
They're gonna love
this publicity.

205
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,019
You guys just earned
your first quarter.

206
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,353
First quarter revenue?

207
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,123
No. First quarter,
like the coin.

208
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,791
Halt and Catch Fire, boy!

209
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,126
Silicon Valley!

210
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,794
How the Web Was Won.

211
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,263
I'll give you another quarter
to shut up.

212
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,299
Monetize.

213
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,904
Look at us,

214
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,106
the bully,

215
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,107
the princess,

216
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,341
more bullies,

217
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,576
the Ralph

218
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,045
and me,
the smart kid no one gets.

219
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,047
Yet, maybe,
by the end of the day,

220
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,616
I'll realize
this is just what I needed.

221
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,318
This is what I needed
to break through the...

222
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,719
Lisa, you don't belong here.

223
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,021
Oh, thank God.
So long, delinquents!

224
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,191
Your detention is being held in
our new facility, the R.O.C.C.

225
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:29,162
Welcome to the Remote On-site
Correctional Center.

226
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,698
How can something be both remote
and on-site?

227
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,366
All right, wisenheimer.

228
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,902
You just earned yourself
a day in the hole.

229
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,271
The Holistic Obstinance
Lessening Environment.

230
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,711
There's nothing in here
but old Goosebumps books.

231
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,146
Fine. Read those.

232
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:49,749
They aren't scary.
They aren't scary!

233
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,851
What happened
to regular detention?

234
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,219
Well, because we could
no longer afford

235
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:55,188
any after-school activity,

236
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,023
the school district has
outsourced detention.

237
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,425
Welcome
to Misbehavior Solutions,

238
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,694
a Torture 500 company.

239
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,130
You privatized detention?

240
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,332
Lisa, you have to understand.

241
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,001
Anyone who's done anything
remotely poor

242
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,769
is in private prison.

243
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,871
Oh, did I say poor?
I meant wrong.

244
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:13,173
No more questions.

245
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,475
So, how's the monetizing going?

246
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,010
Pick a hand.

247
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,278
Pick again.

248
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,779
Not the same hand.

249
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,314
I'm not a magician.
It's in the other hand.

250
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:22,982
Please pick the other hand.

251
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,450
All right, I'm just gonna
show you the check.

252
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,919
Oh, my God!

253
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,354
$5,000!

254
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,790
This will come in handy
when I buy a boat!

255
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,029
Now, for the really big money,
I sold the location rights

256
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,830
to your next fight.

257
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,667
No, no, no.
This needs to be a discussion.

258
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,235
It's here in this
fried chicken restaurant.

259
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,003
End of discussion.

260
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,939
You see,
this place has an image problem.

261
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,807
They've had nine
salmonella deaths

262
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,376
and one fried pinky
in the past week.

263
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,214
Salmon-ella.

264
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,716
So they want you two,
you and you...

265
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,418
to change the conversation.

266
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,987
If there's a regional,
casual dining chain

267
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,790
that needs my help, I'm there!

268
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,626
My heroes.

269
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,695
Okay, kind of, you know,
fake nibble.

270
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,663
- Pretend you're enjoying the thighs.
- I am.

271
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,998
They're made of wax.

272
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,600
Whatever.
I'm on my fourth bucket.

273
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,768
Sad. Okay, just action.

274
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,706
Why, you little...

275
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,543
And escalate and escalate.

276
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,478
Views, views, views.

277
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:27,714
Yes!

278
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,016
Feel the burn.
Literally sit in it.

279
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,218
Would you like some onion rings?

280
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:35,355
I don't see why not.

281
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,157
Beautiful.

282
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,727
Look at those view numbers fly.

283
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,128
I shouldn't say this.

284
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,596
No, I'm gonna say it.

285
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:45,064
Okay, I say it a lot.

286
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:49,402
You two are more beloved
than Marathon-Diarrhea Guy.

287
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:52,138
- I love that guy.
- Best guy.

288
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,674
We have so many sick
sponsored fights lined up.

289
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:56,876
We're gonna make
Marathon-Diarrhea Guy look

290
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,878
like Dog on Washing Machine.

291
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:02,115
- I love that dog!
- Best dog.

292
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,919
Violence is the best.

293
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,522
Dad, you're holding my hand.

294
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:10,923
Is that weird?

295
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,325
I've seen it in books.

296
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,927
Say, boy, can I buy you a...?

297
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:18,064
Nah, I'm good, but thanks.

298
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,766
Give me a Duff, Moe.

299
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:21,968
Your money's no good here.

300
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,370
You're a celebrity now,
Mr. YouTube.

301
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:26,306
The biggest one
this bar has seen

302
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,875
since the snake
that ate three pool balls.

303
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,110
Got a picture of that.
See it?

304
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,712
Anything I can do for you.

305
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,347
Anything. You just name it.

306
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,649
Well, little more
than I thought you'd ask for,

307
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,551
but, no,
I respect the greed.

308
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,520
Now I'm going back to my people.

309
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,255
Hey, how you doing?

310
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:49,028
It's that kid from YouTube!

311
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:52,965
You, my friend,
are getting an escort.

312
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,204
Aw, isn't that cute?

313
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:01,274
Let's give the biggest one a gun
and take the week off.

314
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,179
Milhouse, why are you
in detention?

315
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,748
For using the metric side
of my ruler.

316
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:11,150
That seems pretty arbitrary.

317
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,319
Why am I here?

318
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:16,823
All I did was wear swim trunks
in the shower.

319
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,424
They're packing detention

320
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,026
with minor infractors.

321
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,394
But why?

322
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,629
Why do corporations do anything?

323
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,231
To help society.

324
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,433
We need you
to make kiddie license plates.

325
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,169
I need 100 Caitlyns,
100 Kaitlyns

326
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,306
and a thousand Kate Lynns.

327
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,041
Oh, my mom's picking me up.

328
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,709
She'll be frantic!

329
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,978
Oh, they said
I could pick him up at midnight.

330
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,014
You want something stamped?

331
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,516
How about this?

332
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,651
Strike! Strike! Strike!

333
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,987
Strike! Strike! Strike!

334
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,490
Strike! Strike! Strike!

335
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,024
How do you know about unions?

336
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,761
'Cause our history books end
in the 1930s.

337
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,030
Thanks, guys.

338
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,565
Hey, Dad!

339
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,301
Hey, son!
I kind of missed you.

340
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,137
I kind of missed you too.

341
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,340
Okay, they're hugging.

342
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,342
Excuse me, but I thought
the hate was real.

343
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,110
I have not been so angry

344
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,279
since I saw every Star Wars
since the second.

345
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,681
They are no longer my heroes!

346
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,552
Kumiko, we are changing
the Comic-Con costumes.

347
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,587
We're going back
to our old costumes...

348
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,356
Sailor Moon and the Moon.

349
00:15:28,463 --> 00:15:31,931
Hey there, Chalmers.
Hey there, Skinner.

350
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:35,034
We will be here until dinner!

351
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,037
These Norma Rae-sinets
refuse to back down.

352
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,940
You can cut detention
with a knife.

353
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,076
In other news,
the Pope has died.

354
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,112
My corporation has a deal
with this school

355
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,949
to provide free kishly
happy workers.

356
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:52,151
You better fix this and fast.

357
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,686
I think I have an answer.

358
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:56,823
I know people who will do
anything for money

359
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:00,426
as long as it doesn't
involve kids...

360
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:03,531
the teachers.

361
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,933
<i>Well, I been workin'
in a coal mine</i>

362
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,201
<i>Goin' down, down, down</i>

363
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,569
<i>Workin' in a coal mine</i>

364
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,771
<i>Whew, about to slip down</i>

365
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,039
<i>Workin' in a coal mine</i>

366
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,174
<i>Goin' down, down, down</i>

367
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,876
<i>Workin' in a coal mine...</i>

368
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,144
Take it from the Moon.

369
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,646
Bart and Homer have cratered.

370
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,149
I hate them and I...

371
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:25,218
So, because people think
you like each other,

372
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,652
you're has-beens.

373
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,020
Yesterday's views.

374
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,589
Deader than MySpace.

375
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,024
15 minutes of lame.

376
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:35,361
Why are you still here
around me?

377
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,763
Please help us.
It hurts so much to know

378
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,233
that no one is clicking me
or liking me.

379
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,001
They might have no opinion.

380
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,603
I can't live with that!

381
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,839
May I make an original
and groundbreaking observation

382
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,207
that no one
has ever said before?

383
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,243
There is one thing
that show business loves.

384
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,111
- Betty White?
- A comeback.

385
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,613
We are going to put you
out in front

386
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,047
of some of the greatest
influencers

387
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,183
and tastemakers alive.

388
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,352
We will remake
Bart and Homer Brand.

389
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:02,455
What do you say to BHB2?

390
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,023
Is it a drug?
Lay it on me.

391
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,692
It stands for
Bart Homer Brand 2, you moron.

392
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,661
Of course it is.

393
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,429
Is it a pill?

394
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,198
Or the other end?

395
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,702
This is the largest gathering
of social media influencers

396
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:17,970
in the western hemisphere.

397
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,138
There's Detonator,

398
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,207
the internet's leading
walkthrough gamer.

399
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,808
What's your side quest, Demon?

400
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,677
- Well, I...
- Terminate dialogue tree.

401
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,045
Return to main quest.

402
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:29,882
Hey, there's Leslie Sky.

403
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:32,652
She does makeup tutorials
with veiled white nationalism.

404
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,922
For the foundation,
we can either go with brown,

405
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,189
or skin color.

406
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,559
Oh, my God, it's Jurgen,

407
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,494
Southern Norway's
leading unboxer.

408
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,630
First we take the burger box
from the bag, yeah.

409
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:48,534
Carefully open the box
so it can be reclasped.

410
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:51,103
Robust hinging.

411
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,144
I am tired now.

412
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,779
And winter comes.

413
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:06,085
And now, to tell you
what you're gonna do.

414
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:09,088
Mortal Kombat, Live Online.

415
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,990
Doesn't mortal mean dead?

416
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:14,126
It can, but it's just
a figure of speech.

417
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,095
So we don't kill each other?

418
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:18,264
Oh, if you did,
that would be great.

419
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:19,332
But let's play it by ear.

420
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:20,433
Okay, guys,

421
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,634
when you're in combat,

422
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,169
definitely killing each other,

423
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,471
it's important to feature
your sponsored weapons.

424
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:27,974
Bart, you're promoting Netflix.

425
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,077
Got it?
And Trident gum.

426
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,913
Homer, you're repping
Axe Body Spray

427
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,682
and Trident Spearmint gum.

428
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:37,950
Do you get it, Homer?

429
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,685
The product things
match the words.

430
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:41,587
I don't know,
this seems kind of lame.

431
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:42,788
You know what's not lame?

432
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,957
An audience of 200 livestreams

433
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,492
while you kill your own father.

434
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,361
Or whatever.
Feel it out.

435
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,097
I don't know, I'm gonna need
some more inspiration.

436
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:54,967
Oh, my God, is it really you?

437
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:59,572
It is.

438
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,575
Ladies and gentlemen,

439
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,811
YouTubers, Instagrammers,

440
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,948
and homeless former Viners,

441
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:12,084
you loved them in their
smackdown at Panda Express.

442
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,453
Then they hugged
and you were like, what?

443
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,123
Homer and Bart Simpson!

444
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,425
Do I smell fear?

445
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,060
I'm not afraid of you.

446
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:25,131
You're smelling the refreshing
scent of Axe Body Spray.

447
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,999
Dark Temptation.

448
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:40,246
I don't know, Dad.
This just doesn't feel right.

449
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,981
I don't want to fight you.

450
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,783
Me neither, son.

451
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:51,057
Who'd have thought that two guys
from such different worlds

452
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,825
could connect like us?

453
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,797
Quit using your words!

454
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,489
Hello. I'm Homer Simpson.

455
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:27,226
And this is episode two of
Walkoff Homer.

456
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,661
Today's question.

457
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,831
Are sports talk shows a complete
and utter waste of time?

458
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,499
We will get
to the bottom of this

459
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,468
within the next five hours.

460
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,536
Five hours?!

461
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,638
I can't get my point across
in five hours.

462
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,006
My whole career depends on me

463
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,308
never quite getting
to the finish.

464
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,909
Because I know...
