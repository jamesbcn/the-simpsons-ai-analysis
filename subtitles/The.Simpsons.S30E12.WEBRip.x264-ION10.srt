1
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:19,653
Scientists have determined
that the secret to a long life

2
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,822
is to drink lots of coffee...

3
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,557
or no coffee at all.

4
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:25,326
Now, it's time to kill time with

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,161
This Day in Springfield
History.

6
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:29,830
1906, we become the first
flyover state

7
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,599
when the Wright Brothers
ignore us

8
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:34,068
on a voyage from Ohio
to Kentucky.

9
00:00:34,102 --> 00:00:37,071
1945, peace breaks out

10
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:39,540
and Montgomery Burns fires
his female employees.

11
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:43,944
1961, as the rest of America
rockets into the new frontier,

12
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:47,381
Springfield unveils a fleet
of school busses.

13
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:51,619
These buses are bursting
with American technology.

14
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:54,888
Grooved rubber mats,
and an emergency door

15
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:57,958
that any child could
accidentally open

16
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,794
and fall 15 feet
to the street.

17
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:12,072
Lis, wish me luck.
I'm going for

18
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:14,142
the lunch-boxing
middleweight title.

19
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:15,743
What does it matter?

20
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,911
You'll never unify the belts.

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,049
Okay, champ,
remember your game plan.

22
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,120
Lead with your Krusty,
then jab-jab-jab with my Eeyore.

23
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,958
Work the vest
and the head will die.

24
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:45,673
<i>Each day this bus</i>

25
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:48,075
<i>Is home to chaos</i>

26
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,011
<i>That little boy
is mooning me</i>

27
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,013
<i>This ride's a living hell</i>

28
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,648
<i>Right to the morning bell</i>

29
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:58,152
<i>Please tell me that
that puddle isn't pee</i>

30
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:00,188
I'm taking care
of this goldfish.

31
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:01,989
<i>All I would ask</i>

32
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,124
<i>Is just one friend
to ride with</i>

33
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:07,127
<i>And please not Milhouse
or Kearney</i>

34
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:09,297
Don't drag me
into your lonely song.

35
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,165
<i>Another girl who's smart</i>

36
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,100
<i>With kindness in her heart</i>

37
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,136
<i>Someone who's just exactly
just like...</i>

38
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,138
She?

39
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:28,115
Do we always have to have
the TV on during dinner?

40
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,150
This is a special night,
sweetie.

41
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,186
We've all been waiting for...

42
00:02:34,222 --> 00:02:36,990
Beast Blaster!

43
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:40,127
Welcome back to the U.S. Ninja
Ultimate Beast Blaster,

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,897
where U.S. ninjas fight to
become the ultimate beast.

45
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:46,033
By defeating the ultimate beast,

46
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:50,204
an obstacle course we call
The Ultimate Monster.

47
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:53,707
Well, I saw a cool girl
from the bus today.

48
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,543
It's weird,
I don't know her,

49
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:57,578
but I feel like
we could be friends.

50
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,012
Yeah, you're right,
I think Marcus

51
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:01,181
is gonna take it all this year.

52
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:03,217
He's got the best narrative.

53
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:06,520
He's doing it for his buddies
at MacDill Air Force Base.

54
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:09,690
MacDill!

55
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:11,592
This is your fifth attempt
to slay the monster.

56
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,060
Can you give us the thoughts

57
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,662
that are going through
your mind?

58
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,932
Isn't the first rule
of ninja

59
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,868
to be silent and invisible?

60
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,404
Watching other people live
full lives

61
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,506
is our family activity.

62
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:29,377
That girl I saw out the bus
window was playing the clarinet.

63
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,944
The clarinet.

64
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:34,047
The saxophone's cool
black friend. Yeah...

65
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,616
Oh, my God, what a fail!

66
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,225
I never gave up,
and I taught my kids

67
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,628
to follow their dreams.

68
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,730
Oh, no. Daddy can't hug anymore.
No-no-no.

69
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:54,802
Don't look up.
This bus is too depressing.

70
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:58,005
Backpack attack!

71
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:05,112
It smells
like Milhouse's back.

72
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:08,115
Lisa knows what my back
smells like.

73
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,117
Hamster volleyball.

74
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,121
You lose.
Lisa counts as floor.

75
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:16,156
That's it.
There's gotta be a better place.

76
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,926
Otto. Stop the bus.
I wanna get off.

77
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,094
You're the boss.

78
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:23,130
Can we get some ice cream?

79
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,098
I'm not that crazy.
Yogurt.

80
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,103
Oh, my God. I'm in that
other girl's neighborhood.

81
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:33,674
Without the baggage
of being Lisa Simpson.

82
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,943
Yo. Sis-boom-blah.
Little help?

83
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,745
Go. Go live.

84
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,080
Go love. Multiply.

85
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:50,958
Look at all these boutiques.

86
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,793
I've never been
in a neighborhood

87
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:56,296
where the parking lots
were behind the stores.

88
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,132
This is her house.

89
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:10,177
Hello? Hello?

90
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:22,523
Hello? It's me,
the girl on the bus!

91
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:27,327
I'm moving past the tasteful
craftsman fixtures,

92
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:30,798
the eco-conscious lighting
that turns on when I enter

93
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,033
and turns off when I leave.

94
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,835
And now the jade tree,

95
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,137
which I'm watering
just a little.

96
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,007
Oh, no.

97
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:46,814
Hi, don't be afraid.
I'm Lisa.

98
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,416
I saw you from my school bus.

99
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:50,418
At least, I think it was you.

100
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,724
- Why were you crying?
- Because I just read

101
00:05:56,757 --> 00:06:01,529
the Pacific garbage patch grew
to 600,000 square miles.

102
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,831
So then I put on The Dolphin

103
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,433
by Stan Getz to cheer up.

104
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:09,069
But it was so beautiful
I cried even more.

105
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:12,039
You are just like the friend
I've described

106
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,041
to so many wishing wells.

107
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:17,077
By the way,
I play the saxophone.

108
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,080
Here. Take one.

109
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:28,689
Wait a minute, this is gonna
end badly, isn't it?

110
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,691
That's just what I was thinking.

111
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,693
We have so much in common.

112
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,034
So what do you do, Mrs. Monroe?

113
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,903
I'm a marine biologist.

114
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:45,038
I was in an improv group
and asked the audience

115
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,241
for an occupation, and I just
fell in love with the work.

116
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:51,445
I yes-and-ed myself
into a career.

117
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:52,980
More seitan gumbo, Lisa?

118
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,082
The rice is conflict-free.

119
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,217
Yes. It's not to die for.

120
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:02,556
Oh, your mother keeps a journal
of what you say?

121
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,125
She'll wear these pearls
forever.

122
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,094
Oh, that's good.

123
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:14,101
<i>Some others I've seen</i>

124
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:18,238
<i>Might never be mean</i>

125
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,474
<i>Might never be cross</i>

126
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:22,409
<i>Or try to be boss</i>

127
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,277
<i>But they wouldn't do</i>

128
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,949
<i>For nobody else</i>

129
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,151
<i>Gave me a thrill</i>

130
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,786
<i>With all your faults</i>

131
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,187
<i>I love you still</i>

132
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,590
<i>It had to be you</i>

133
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:38,592
<i>Wonderful you</i>

134
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,761
<i>It had to be you</i>

135
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:50,003
- I love you.
- I love you.

136
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:55,375
You do not say suck
at the dinner table!

137
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,444
But veggie loaf does suck.

138
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,713
It sucks a whole truck
full of butts.

139
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,615
You leave trucks out of this.

140
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:03,150
Just eat your loafs.

141
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,152
How was dinner
with your friend, honey?

142
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,954
Suck, suck, suckity, suck,
suckity, suck.

143
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,056
- It's a little different, I'd say.
- Suck, suck, suck, suck.

144
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,858
- Not better. Just different.
- Suck, suck, suck, suck...

145
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,225
Can I ask a question?

146
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,094
I wanna see this.

147
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,798
Dina and Lucas
have never met each other,

148
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,800
but by the time
this roller coaster

149
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,870
goes down this final hill,
they'll be married.

150
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:26,006
So, what do you do for fun?

151
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:29,810
I'm making a hammock
of human hair!

152
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,911
Boy, pass the salt.

153
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,145
Coming right up.

154
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,716
You did that on purpose.

155
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,651
Well, I'm not giving you
the satisfaction.

156
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,152
Excuse me,
I have a question.

157
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,253
Not now!

158
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,155
I like your hair!

159
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,124
Get me out of here.

160
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:50,931
Oh, this is so good.
Oh, just the way I like it.

161
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,433
Salty. So salty.

162
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,435
Aging rapidly.

163
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,204
Where's Charlie Rose?

164
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:03,543
Please, one simple question.

165
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:05,078
What is it?

166
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:08,081
Why do we have to eat dinner
together every night?

167
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:11,685
Because it's good
for the damn family.

168
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:14,688
Now, Lisa,
I know you're a vegetarian.

169
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:17,557
Do you mind if we eat this
in front of you?

170
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:20,127
Oh, no. No.
Not at all.

171
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,730
And the fact that you would even
ask how I felt...

172
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:25,232
I don't need dessert,
because you being considerate

173
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,234
is sweet enough.

174
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:31,038
- Well put.
- So well put.

175
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:35,042
Judging from you, I'm sure your
family is just as delightful

176
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:38,378
and rinfrescante come la brezza
del lago di Como.

177
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:42,282
Yes, my family.

178
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,052
I try not to brag about them.

179
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,954
More coconut water, please.

180
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:54,294
Such a shame that we'll never,
ever meet them.

181
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,164
- How come?
- We're going to be moving soon.

182
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,066
My research grant came through.

183
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,068
Sam's father studies
the harmful effects

184
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,136
of family relocation
on children.

185
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,272
Takes me all over the world.

186
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,574
So I guess you'll never meet
my parents.

187
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,477
So we'll only know them through
what you say right now.

188
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,145
Right. Now.

189
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:15,082
Well, my father...

190
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,951
works with his hands,
he's a sculptor.

191
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,086
And your mother?

192
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,022
Mother is a chemist.

193
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,658
And I have a sister too.

194
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:28,862
She's a professor of
non-linguistic communication.

195
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:31,665
Has a high chair.

196
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,901
Fascinating.
Do you have any brothers?

197
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:36,770
Nope.

198
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,105
My point is,

199
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,673
there are many scientists
who have questions

200
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:41,341
- about global warming.
- Well, that's

201
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,343
an interesting perspective,
Congressman.

202
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:47,147
You can tell Terry Gross
is really mad at this guy.

203
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,051
Oh-oh-oh-oh, you can
just let me off right here.

204
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,153
No, no, no.
We'll go right to your house.

205
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,988
Maybe I can meet your father.

206
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,123
Ah, you sure can.

207
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,958
Hey, there he is!

208
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,492
Hi-diddly-ho!

209
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,061
Daddy!

210
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,963
Just go with it.

211
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,832
God bless you and,
as I like to say,

212
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,133
a hearty woo-hoo!

213
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,702
Well, God bless you,
Mr. Simpson.

214
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,741
I hate stupid Flanders!

215
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,242
Annoyed grunt, annoyed grunt!

216
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,977
Thank you.

217
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,747
Mm, deception.

218
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:22,816
I got you a goodbye present.

219
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,018
I'm really good
at goodbye presents.

220
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:27,354
Ordered this the day I met you.

221
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:30,223
Well, I got you a Rubik's Cube.
Solve it.

222
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,594
What?!

223
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,163
My government grant
was rescinded

224
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,032
to pay for an exit latch
on a new fighter plane.

225
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,935
The good news is, now we
can meet your wonderful mother.

226
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:45,739
Oh, that is exactly
what you could do...

227
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,078
if I wasn't here to tell you

228
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:54,181
my parents are going
to Portugal.

229
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,017
Oh! We love Portugal!

230
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,187
Let me call them
with our top ten pastelaria!

231
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,056
I mean,
Portugal is their layover

232
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,258
when they connect to...

233
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:08,595
Lithuania!

234
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,130
Have you been to Lithuania?

235
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:13,033
No.
And it is quite a sore spot.

236
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,135
Lisa, I'll miss you.

237
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,937
Oh, no, I'm not going with them.

238
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,039
I'm staying with my
grandfather.

239
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,874
That sounds right.

240
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:23,743
- Why don't you stay with us?
- Stay with your family?

241
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,146
In this home full of art
and culture

242
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,148
and you got a miniature horse?

243
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,750
It's a rare breed
that gets cuter as it ages.

244
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,621
So, what do you say?

245
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:36,957
Okay, that's it.
I've been piling lie upon lie

246
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,225
like a bad French farce.

247
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,060
So what is one more?

248
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:49,837
Okay, I will come over here
every night at 7:30 after my...

249
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,472
swimming lessons.

250
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:56,109
But also, I have to leave
at 6:30 every morning for my...

251
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:58,979
morning swimming lessons.

252
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,113
You're a swimmer, Lisa.

253
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:03,116
We would never presume
to question your schedule.

254
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,608
How was your swimming lesson?

255
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,610
It went swimmingly!

256
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,725
Wake up, sleepyhead.

257
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,863
Dressed so fast.

258
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:53,100
Well, when you wear the same
thing every day, it's easy.

259
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,005
What?

260
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:00,240
You were sleeping like teacher.

261
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,677
Oh, Ralph. I'm deceiving
all the people I love,

262
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:07,814
and it's so exciting.

263
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,084
Lies are like stars,
they always come out.

264
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:13,853
Oh, my God,
that's really profound.

265
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:15,989
I have five face holes.

266
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,690
One, two,

267
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:21,294
three, four, fi...

268
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,363
Good night, Mom.

269
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,698
Good night, honey.

270
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:34,107
Hello, Lisa.

271
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:36,910
Sideshow Mom!

272
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:45,618
I can't believe you've
been seeing another family!

273
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,087
How did you know?

274
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,521
I found out from Ned.

275
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,723
He feels so guilty
about pretending

276
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,160
to be your father,
but he can't stop.

277
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,063
Look at me in sector 7-G!

278
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:58,531
D'oh diddly d'oh!

279
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,034
I'm sorry,
I didn't want to hurt you guys,

280
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,936
I really didn't,
but once I started lying,

281
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,571
I just couldn't stop.

282
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,806
It's like an addiction.

283
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,978
I have no idea what that's like.

284
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,652
Lisa, I understand
that this family isn't perfect.

285
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,454
Your mom has her flaws,

286
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:24,124
but there are a lot of people
who really like her.

287
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,959
Mom's not the problem.

288
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:27,961
So, it's Maggie.

289
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:29,796
I know she can't speak.

290
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:32,265
She's just a little S-L-O.

291
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:36,103
It's all of us, Homer.
She's embarrassed by all of us.

292
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:38,138
No! Not at all!

293
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:41,008
You said I was a chemist.
I'm not a chemist.

294
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,177
But you are a chemist
in the way that you deal

295
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,778
with the household spills
and the way...

296
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:46,946
Oh, spare me.

297
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,749
And just what did you say I was?

298
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,951
I said you never existed.

299
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,453
That's the life for me!

300
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,088
I'm not a chemist.

301
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:56,589
I never even finished college.

302
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,591
I'm just someone
who devotes every day

303
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,528
to making your life
a little better.

304
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,330
What are you gonna do to me?

305
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:04,998
- I'm gonna make you get up...
- Yeah.

306
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:06,833
- Go to the phone...
- Okay.

307
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:09,169
- Call up that family...
- Oh, God.

308
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,204
And ask them to dinner with us.

309
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,844
They said they're free Saturday.

310
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:19,646
They'll be here at 7:00.

311
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,517
And they asked
if they could bring dessert!

312
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,319
Whew, poor kid.

313
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:28,955
Man, you're really
teaching her a lesson.

314
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,790
We are teaching her a lesson.

315
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,061
And I appreciate your support.

316
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:35,528
Come back here!

317
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:38,465
Ask her
if we can have pizza tonight.

318
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,533
You can have pizza,
but your father

319
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,070
- gets vegetables.
- D'oh!

320
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,243
How could she be so embarrassed
of her own family?

321
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:52,912
We've got to help Lisa make
a good impression.

322
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,515
Stop drinking out of that hose!

323
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:58,218
Oh, so now drinking
out of a hose

324
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:01,488
in my own bedroom
is embarrassing!

325
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,392
Homer. Homer?

326
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:06,593
Homer.

327
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,661
Homer.
I'm giving you a list

328
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,098
of four things to say
at dinner tonight.

329
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:13,066
Four things. That's it.

330
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,168
One, two, three...

331
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,337
You're right.

332
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,540
At dinner tonight, I don't want
you to be somebody you aren't.

333
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,942
I also don't want you to be
who you are.

334
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,379
- So just stick to these.
- All right.

335
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:28,381
I completely angry!

336
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,016
That's agree.

337
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,451
Oh, much better.

338
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:32,885
And that's how

339
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,422
my family got
from Nigeria to London.

340
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,023
Tell me more about that.

341
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,925
I'm sorry, but I can't.

342
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,594
I've literally said everything
you could say on the topic.

343
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:43,763
You've made me recall
wonderful moments

344
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,765
I haven't thought of in years.

345
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,968
It's amazing
how Homer draws people out.

346
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,770
I completely angr...

347
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,038
agree.

348
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,541
You're a fascinating man,
Mr. Simpson.

349
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,943
I get my best ideas
in the shower.

350
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:59,379
Tell me one.
I've been doing all the talking.

351
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,648
That's really interesting.

352
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,985
No, please. I want to know
what's in your head.

353
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,000
You like beer?

354
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,636
I love beer!

355
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,305
Such a lovely family.

356
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,940
We're so glad
we got to know you.

357
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,842
Actually, you didn't.

358
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,744
I lied about my family.

359
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,314
Mom, I'm so sorry I was ashamed.

360
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:36,949
I feel worse than
I've ever felt in my life.

361
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:40,153
It will haunt
the person I become forever.

362
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:42,455
Aw, honey,
I'm just as bad as you.

363
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:45,158
I coached your father
and brother on how to act

364
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:46,959
to get through this dinner.

365
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,462
I've actually misled you myself.

366
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:51,464
I said I'm from Nigeria.

367
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:53,833
In truth, I moved there
when I was two.

368
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,535
I'm from Cameroon.

369
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:58,371
Didn't you wonder why the man
I told you was my father

370
00:18:58,405 --> 00:18:59,972
didn't look like him?

371
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,175
I assumed
he had lost all his hair

372
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:04,311
and put on
an obscene amount of weight.

373
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:07,146
Well, it's really hard
running your own business.

374
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,316
You don't run your own business.

375
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,751
I'm starting a new farce.

376
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:17,023
Wow, honesty
really kills a party.

377
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,459
What do you say we all
go kick it in my new room?

378
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,161
- When did you get a new room?
- While everyone was focused

379
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:24,063
on Lisa,
I did a little remodel.

380
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,233
I didn't pull permits,
but it's up to code.

381
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,171
Boy, why did you do this?

382
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,740
Where are you gonna sleep?

383
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,876
Sleep's for farmers.
I wanted a place to chill.

384
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,177
Oh, I get it.

385
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,579
Totally get it.

386
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,981
So, that's two more beers.

387
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,484
And what were you drinking
there, Cheryl?

388
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:49,021
Cranapple martini.

389
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,923
My first happy ending!

390
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,326
I completely agree.

391
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,528
I love you, Mom!

392
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,530
I love you, Sam.

393
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:59,332
I love you, Bart.

394
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:02,101
And I love you, room.

395
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:11,077
Disco Stu, always pitchin' woo.

396
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,745
Ferocious, Drederick.

397
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:14,414
You and the cheetah.

398
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,754
Let me in.
I need to talk to the boy!

399
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:24,757
- This has gotten out of hand!
- Not on the list.

400
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,727
Come on, man, I know him.
We hang out all the time.

401
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,928
Sure you do.

402
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,930
You can come in, sweetheart.

403
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,065
I'll take care of this, Homie.

404
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,306
Move along, sir.
You're blocking the fire escape.
