1
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:11,979
Hubert, great work
on the cafeteria gravy story.

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,882
Answered a lot of questions
but raised a lot more.

3
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:20,988
I come bearing the thing
you journalists hate most, news.

4
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,491
The Daily Fourth Gradian
is hemorrhaging money.

5
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,493
Last month the paper lost...

6
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,528
$32.

7
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:30,731
But you can't put a price
on the truth.

8
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,067
I finally got a source
to go on the record

9
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:35,002
about dodgeball concussions.

10
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,004
Bombardment, bombardment.

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,940
Bombardment.

12
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,776
I'm sorry, but I have no choice
but to bring in a new editor.

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,245
The fifth grader who somehow

14
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:46,114
turned the school
poetry magazine

15
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:49,950
into a cash-blasting
fire hose, Billy.

16
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,553
Preschool is over, news skanks.

17
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,388
Today is gonna be
like Carrie Underwood

18
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:56,290
hosting the
Country Music Awards...

19
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:58,359
we're in for a lot of changes.

20
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,794
You... I can tell
you're a real talent.

21
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:02,630
Get out. You're fired.

22
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,465
See? No one's safe.

23
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,934
Fidget spinner.

24
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,236
What are you doing?

25
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,037
Hubert's a good journalist.

26
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,706
Good journalism ain't paying
the pizza man, toots.

27
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,975
We are going online only.

28
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,645
Pop-culture quizzes,
sponsored lists,

29
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,880
headlines that grab you
by the book bag...

30
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,416
You Won't Believe
What Milhouse Looks Like Now.

31
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,084
You bet your book bag I won't.

32
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:26,220
But you can't just turn
the school paper

33
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:27,621
into online clickbait.

34
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:29,390
We have a responsibility to...

35
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,392
Oh, my God, it's still talking.

36
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,295
I hate you so much I'm giving
you the most important job

37
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:35,729
at this swipe rag.

38
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:38,132
- You're a what?
- I'm a recapper.

39
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:40,067
What?

40
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,969
A TV recapper.

41
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:45,139
I watch every episode of a show,
then write a summary,

42
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:48,142
followed by snarky comments
and a letter grade.

43
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:49,977
Well, sometimes I do worry

44
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,814
I have the wrong opinions
about what I've just seen.

45
00:01:59,051 --> 00:02:00,488
This isn't me.

46
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:03,457
What kind of person can just
spew out an endless stream

47
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,759
of knee-jerk reactions?

48
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,995
They should hand out candy
at Thanksgiving

49
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,631
and stuffing at Halloween.

50
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:14,302
Say, Dad, you sure have a lot
of strong opinions.

51
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:17,305
Why don't you watch this show
and tell me what you think?

52
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:20,874
<i>Fight, fight, fight,
The Itchy & Scratchy Show!</i>

53
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,550
Hey, yeah.

54
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,793
The mouse and the cat
hate each other.

55
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,362
That feels real to me.

56
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,464
It was quite a ride,
and I was on board

57
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,466
until the shawarma
screamed.

58
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,235
Very disappointing.

59
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:49,136
An instant classic.

60
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,306
Dad, you were born to describe
TV at a fourth-grade level.

61
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,342
Ooh, well.

62
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,977
Would you recap The Krusty Show
for my school paper?

63
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,348
All you have to do is watch TV
and say things about it.

64
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:03,851
Just say things about TV.

65
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:15,229
Krusty, a recapper is now
reviewing your show.

66
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:16,764
Let me see that.

67
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,332
Monologue seemed endless?

68
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:20,501
Pie clearly hits face
of stunt double?

69
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,936
Overuse of comedic rule
of three?!

70
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,938
Why would I possibly care

71
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:27,841
about the opinion of this
pathetic bottom feeder?

72
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,110
B-minus?!

73
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,116
C-plus?!

74
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,052
C-minus?

75
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:43,291
Today's Krusty Show pulled out
all the stops.

76
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,958
Which was a huge mistake,

77
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,995
as many of the stops should have
been left in. D-plus.

78
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,270
I'll teach you

79
00:03:56,304 --> 00:03:59,740
to insult a thin-skinned
Hollywood narcissist.

80
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,743
Oh, Tesla, your 900-pound feet

81
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:06,447
of silent, instant torque is
the perfect killing machine.

82
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,118
Where do I know that guy?

83
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,722
Vengeful clown!

84
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,593
Krusty is trying to murder me.

85
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:21,595
If he does,

86
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:24,732
it will be the first time
he's killed in years.

87
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,734
I'm not funny?

88
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,703
You want to see something
really humor?!

89
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:34,141
Running me off the road?

90
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,844
Clearly,
a murderer out of ideas.

91
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:41,849
Like my show!

92
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:45,185
Why?
Is it season four again?

93
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,654
Why, you.

94
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:12,880
Oh, please be okay.
Please be okay.

95
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:16,116
If anything happened to you,
I don't know what I'd do.

96
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,785
Oh, give me a sign.

97
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,520
Let me know my world isn't over.

98
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:20,988
Don't look in my trunk!

99
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,824
But if you do,
a Chinese doctor says I need it.

100
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,226
Oh, you're okay.

101
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,129
All right, tell me who assaulted
you, and we'll bring 'em in.

102
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,532
Unless it's gangs
or motorcycle guys.

103
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,467
A motorcycle guy will whip you

104
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:35,335
right in the face
with his chain.

105
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:36,970
He doesn't care.

106
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,006
Krusty tried
to run me off the road!

107
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,542
But I'm still alive. C-plus.

108
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,080
Don't worry, Krusty.

109
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:49,983
I know a place where the police
will never find you.

110
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:53,854
Yeah, good luck, kid,
but I'm a big-time TV celebrity.

111
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:56,824
The last thing
I could ever do is blend in.

112
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,763
The circus? Why?

113
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,432
You're a clown.

114
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:06,600
I won't stand here
and be insulted!

115
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,636
Y... Oh, right.

116
00:06:11,606 --> 00:06:13,775
Kid, I'm a TV clown,

117
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:16,510
not like these trapeze-sucking
tent-fluffers.

118
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18,345
Circus clowns don't talk,

119
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:22,115
while I perform to camera
with finely honed subtlety.

120
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:23,885
Hey-hey!

121
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,954
Easy on the hey-heys.

122
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,122
The cops are looking
everywhere for you.

123
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,591
I can't go to jail.

124
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:33,293
I just quit smoking.
What do I do?

125
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:37,097
So, what do you call
yourself?

126
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,733
Soggy. Soggy the Clown.

127
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,469
Thought we already had
a Soggy.

128
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,370
Nah, nah,
you're thinking of Moisty.

129
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,938
You're hired.

130
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:47,475
So, Soggy, what's your act?

131
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:49,643
Well, I can introduce cartoons,

132
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:52,746
pretend to enjoy
children's breakfast cereal.

133
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,882
Oh, and I completely
blow my stack

134
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,150
when someone takes
my parking space.

135
00:06:57,184 --> 00:07:00,454
You sound like a TV clown.

136
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:02,456
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

137
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,392
I hate TV clowns
from how you just said that.

138
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,227
TV clowns.

139
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,429
Riding four to a car
like royalty,

140
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:12,232
eating their stew from a bowl
instead of cupped hands.

141
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:16,670
And you know who's the worst is
that white-faced Judas, Krusty.

142
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:19,072
Wait.
Circus clowns hate Krusty?

143
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,440
Don't you?

144
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,843
In my way
I've hated him all my life.

145
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,646
Yeah, you get it, Soggy.
You're a good kid.

146
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,315
Anyway, this is where you eat,
this is where you sleep,

147
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:31,084
and this is where
you sweep up the elephant crap.

148
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:34,588
So, all three in this cage.

149
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:35,923
Efficient, right?

150
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,491
Now meet the finest clowns

151
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:40,460
from the greatest closed
circuses in the world.

152
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,129
Skitters, Bumpo, Wiggles,

153
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,598
Clabby, Dr. Pickles, Mr. Bindle,

154
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:46,634
Barrels, Drooly, Trembles,

155
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:47,801
Blitzy, Handsy,

156
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:49,302
Boobsy, Mr. Boobsy,

157
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,539
Baby Boobsy, the Boobsy Twins,

158
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53,373
Ding-a-ling, Bing-bong,
Ring-a-ling,

159
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,475
Flip-Flop, Fiddle-Faddle,
Flap-Jack,

160
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:56,510
and Scene Blow.

161
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:57,511
Nice to meet...

162
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,515
Yeah.

163
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:06,787
It's him. It's really him.

164
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,657
A regular dork and a girl one.

165
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,660
It is an honor to meet the man
whose recaps were so devastating

166
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:15,629
that the star of the show tried
to kill him.

167
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:17,965
The secret is,
say what happened.

168
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,500
Oh, it's like we're talking
to Hemingway.

169
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,736
Or Shep Goldfein
from TV Zorp.

170
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,305
How would you like
to come recap for us

171
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,407
full-time at Culture Smash?

172
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,810
You'll pay me to watch TV?

173
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,413
God bless you,
content-addicted clickbaiters.

174
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,315
We'll start you on 30 shows.

175
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,984
This month?

176
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,351
No, tonight.

177
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:41,021
Welcome to Peak TV.

178
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,224
This is us.

179
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,426
This is me.

180
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,828
C-plus.

181
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,036
Hey there, Soggy.

182
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,871
You excited for your first show?

183
00:08:57,905 --> 00:08:59,707
Nervous? I'm not nervous.

184
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,441
Get this kid. Nervous.

185
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,943
Nervous.

186
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,045
Well, you sure are saying
nervous a lot.

187
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,714
Shut up,
you nervous little punk.

188
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,782
I'm the king of 4:00 p.m. TV.

189
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:11,218
I can clown the pants off
these losers.

190
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:20,894
Whoa, what is that?

191
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:23,463
That's what the clowns here
drink before the tent opens.

192
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,133
- It's called Hippo Juice.
- Do you even know what's in it?

193
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,901
I need my Hippo Juice!

194
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:09,176
Okay, Walking Dead.

195
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,779
Too much walking,
not enough dead. C-plus.

196
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,113
Game of Thrones.

197
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,982
Who is everybody? A-plus.

198
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:18,819
Stranger Things.
Spielberg's back. C-minus.

199
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,755
Homie, you're watching
so many shows.

200
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,456
Why don't you take a break?

201
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,626
We can open the third drawer
of the nightstand.

202
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,195
The anniversary drawer.

203
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,803
Making out on the bed...
a familiar formula,

204
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,504
but still delivers the goods.

205
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,639
Ooh, a butt-squeeze.

206
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:42,375
Motivated by character
and moves the story forward.

207
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,211
Could an ear nibble
be the thing

208
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,513
to reinvigorate
this tired franchise?

209
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:49,182
Wait. Are you recapping
our snuggle?

210
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,618
No, no, just pillow talk, baby.

211
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,486
If you say so.

212
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,788
Savvy viewers will notice

213
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,724
the husband hasn't brushed
his teeth.

214
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:58,291
That is it.

215
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,962
You're watching so many TV shows
for your recapping job,

216
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,831
it's ruining our life.

217
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:06,199
And don't you dare give me
a letter grade.

218
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:09,803
Okay, I'll just let this be...
minus.

219
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:12,639
It's either me or the job.

220
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,810
Marge creates what feels
like false jeopardy.

221
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:19,679
No, the moment is well earned.

222
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:24,051
Oh, they just got rid
of their best character.

223
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:28,722
Soggy, a word of advice,
you suck.

224
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:30,590
Turn in your Hippo Juice bucket,

225
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,692
your hippo crystals,
and your hippo pipe.

226
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:34,227
You're fired.

227
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,064
Oh, come on, Tootso.

228
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,698
You don't really mean that,
do you?

229
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:40,533
Oh, it's true.

230
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:43,737
I'm a terrible clown.

231
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:45,172
Cheer up, Krusty.

232
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,175
There's got to be another circus
out there, a worse one.

233
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,277
Nah. I'm not a TV clown.

234
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,879
I'm not a circus clown.

235
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:54,214
I'm nothing.

236
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,850
Soggy,
the high wire bear got sick

237
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,718
after eating
the Guess-Your-Weight Guy,

238
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,520
so we need somebody
to do his act.

239
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,022
And none of the other clowns
will do it

240
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,456
because there's no net.

241
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,058
So, well, we thought of you.

242
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:07,795
You mean a last chance
to redeem myself?

243
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,897
No. No, no. If you live,
you're still fired.

244
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,398
Oh, who cares?

245
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:12,933
I'm in.

246
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,734
<i>I don't care</i>

247
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:15,969
<i>If I live or die</i>

248
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:18,972
<i>Wait, I do, I want to die</i>

249
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:20,473
<i>Who will claim my body?</i>

250
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:21,975
<i>Maybe the monkey</i>

251
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,801
They're applauding.

252
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:49,136
And there's no applause sign.

253
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,971
I didn't know that was possible.

254
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:54,307
Circus cheers are the greatest
cheers in the world!

255
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,977
There he is,
there's our new star.

256
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,979
That was the most daring act
I've ever seen.

257
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:02,415
And I saw a circus do a Beatles
tribute without permission.

258
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,985
I think I'm falling for you,
Soggy.

259
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,120
I don't think
you're really my type.

260
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,459
Mm, you.

261
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:19,132
My whole life up till now
was nothing.

262
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,469
From this day forward,
I am Soggy,

263
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,604
Soggy the Clown!

264
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,129
I'm flattered, Tootso,

265
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,230
but I'm already seeing someone.

266
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,401
I'll meet you behind
the seal tank in half an hour.

267
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:58,138
Good news.
Your agent just called.

268
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,340
A Japanese game show needs
an American celebrity

269
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:03,310
to pop out of toilets
to scare couples on dates.

270
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,078
The cops will never find you.

271
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:07,180
Two weeks ago,
I would've jumped at that.

272
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:09,649
But I'm a circus clown now.

273
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,818
But you're a big-time TV star.

274
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,686
Ain't the circus worse by far?

275
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,223
Oh, I used to love celebrity,

276
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,825
but I've got big top clarity.

277
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,860
Because...

278
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,266
<i>Circus clowning</i>

279
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,235
<i>Is the life for me</i>

280
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:31,071
<i>Gonna flip the bird
to lousy kids' TV</i>

281
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:34,574
<i>Circus folk have
real camaraderie</i>

282
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,277
<i>I can't be fired 'cause
they don't test my pee</i>

283
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,914
<i>He'd be positive
for every sedative</i>

284
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:44,351
<i>Circus laughter,
there's no greater high</i>

285
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,120
<i>Crowd is fired up 'cause
they might see you die</i>

286
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:48,588
<i>If he breaks his neck</i>

287
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,423
<i>What a thrill they'll get</i>

288
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:53,726
<i>All my problems have been
solved for free</i>

289
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,964
<i>Talking to the bear
sure beats therapy</i>

290
00:14:56,997 --> 00:15:00,300
<i>A hug can beat fear
of women's feet</i>

291
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,236
<i>Can I join the circus
if I'm only ten?</i>

292
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,805
<i>Here's a fake I.D.
now your name is Ben</i>

293
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:09,542
<i>Ain't no mom to keep me
safe and sound</i>

294
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,244
<i>I get to juggle swords</i>

295
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,046
<i>Eat corn dogs off the ground</i>

296
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,449
<i>So, good riddance to TV</i>

297
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,986
<i>I feel alive
instead of live-plus-three</i>

298
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,988
<i>Because circus clowning</i>

299
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,956
<i>Is the life for</i>

300
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,391
<i>Me</i>

301
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:28,628
Bad news...

302
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,130
we're shutting down
the circus.

303
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,931
Shutting it down?
But why?

304
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:34,667
- A terrible video got out.
- Which one?

305
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,270
The video we sell here
at the circus.

306
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:40,273
If they close this place down,
what do I run away to?

307
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:41,308
College?

308
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:42,909
It's all over.

309
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,145
I'm losing the only happiness
I didn't have to chug,

310
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,814
snort, shoot, bet on,
or get enlarged.

311
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,650
For the first time,
I was a real clown.

312
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,520
And now I've lost that.

313
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:57,157
To save my marriage,
effective immediately,

314
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,958
I'm resigning as recapper.

315
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:00,827
My apologies to Culture Smash

316
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,330
and the entire Garbage Blast
media family.

317
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,571
- Get in.
- Okay.

318
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,312
Homer, I'm the CEO of a major
media conglomerate.

319
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:20,813
We can't have you quit.

320
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,150
You're one of America's
top recappers.

321
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:26,153
I had to quit, recapping
was ruining my marriage.

322
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:28,488
There were so many shows,
I couldn't keep up.

323
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:32,159
It's true. Currently there are
over 500 scripted shows

324
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,327
on network, cable,
and streaming.

325
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,629
Why are you making
so many shows?

326
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,232
No one could watch
more than 300 of them.

327
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:40,967
Oh, we don't care
if people watch.

328
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,805
We just care if they subscribe
for $13 a month.

329
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,907
You see, if people subscribe
but don't watch,

330
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,310
then we don't actually
have to make the shows.

331
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,046
We just need viewers to believe
they can watch them.

332
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,481
Fake shows?

333
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:55,982
But what if people try
to see them?

334
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,351
They won't,
because recappers like you

335
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,387
will give those shows
a B-minus.

336
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,090
No one ever watches
a B-minus.

337
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,991
But, but that's crazy.

338
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,526
It could never work.

339
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,860
It already has.

340
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,430
Are you familiar
with the USA Network?

341
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:14,367
Sure. Royal Pains, Suits,
White Collar.

342
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:17,270
Have you ever seen any
of those shows?

343
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:19,772
No, but somebody must have...

344
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,274
Surely somebody...

345
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:23,543
There is no USA Network.

346
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,545
There hasn't been for 20 years.

347
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,614
It's just bus ads!

348
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,116
Oh, my God.

349
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,951
Peak TV is a lie.

350
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,786
Your plan is insane.

351
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,088
Perhaps.

352
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:37,023
But not as insane
as making...

353
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:41,027
that many shows.

354
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,630
I never had faith in God
or family,

355
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:46,266
but I had faith in television.

356
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,801
And I won't let you do this
to him.

357
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:53,373
I have everything you said
recapped right here.

358
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,974
And I'm gonna tell
the whole world

359
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,444
every detail
of your terrible plan.

360
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,314
Hey, there's half a birthday
cake in the break room.

361
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:02,715
Mind if I...?

362
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,651
All right, I get it, I get it.

363
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,962
No, no, you can't close
the circus.

364
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:18,131
There's got to be a way
to keep this place running.

365
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:20,467
If we only had 50 grand,
we could start over

366
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,302
with a new name
and a new act.

367
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,737
Yeah. We can get
the Flying Branzinos.

368
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,807
Nobody pickpockets a crowd
like those guys.

369
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,578
But we don't have
the 50 grand.

370
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,781
The circus is done.

371
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,251
No, no, listen.

372
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:40,753
I can get you your money.

373
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,955
With this.

374
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,691
You're gonna teach us to read?

375
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:47,026
No. I'm Krusty.

376
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,132
Hey-hey.

377
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,992
On the count of attempted murder
of Homer Simpson,

378
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,462
the jury finds
Herschel Krustofsky...

379
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,130
not guilty?

380
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,166
It was self-defense,
Your Honor.

381
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,238
That recapper gave Krusty's
show bad grades.

382
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:33,640
It was justifiable Homer-cide.

383
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,309
He gave Outlander a B-minus.

384
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:39,646
That show knows what it
wants to be. Come on.

385
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,483
Oh, I've heard that gets really
good about eight episodes in.

386
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,151
Krusty, you're free to go.

387
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,992
Is there room on that train
for one more clown?

388
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,894
Well, he did save the circus.

389
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,329
What do you say, Scuzzo?

390
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:59,332
Please, I'm not Krusty anymore.

391
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,601
I'm a circus clown.

392
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,737
I'm Soggy.

393
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:07,006
You're a, you're a TV clown.

394
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,577
The greatest TV clown
I've ever had the honor to know.

395
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,078
But you're a traitor
to our kind.

396
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:27,126
Goodbye, circus.

397
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,561
Goodbye.

398
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:38,271
Another terrible show.

399
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:41,274
Thanks a lot, Chris Pine.

400
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,611
And now the bad recap.

401
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:47,880
They always find some new chump
to tear me down.

402
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,749
A? I got an A?

403
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:51,818
Everything I've ever done
has been great!

404
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,820
I'll never be sad again.

405
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,490
A is for Ralph.

406
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:12,505
Dad, look, they posted our story
this morning.

407
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,477
Together we've exposed
the truth.

408
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:21,748
It will be the one legitimate piece
of journalism on the whole site.

409
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,651
What's with this boring
Peak TV article?

410
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:27,587
My patience is growing shorter
than Rachel Maddow's crew cut.

411
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,456
How many times do I have
to tell you...

412
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:30,990
No bait, no clicks.

413
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,625
Hey, you, yeah, gummy bear,

414
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:34,927
put up a slideshow
that'll get me some eyeballs.

415
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,363
Eyeballs!
