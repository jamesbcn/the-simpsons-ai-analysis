1
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,544
It's dark.

2
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,115
D'oh!

3
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:25,316
Hot dogs! Not so hot dogs!

4
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,953
Cold and droopy!

5
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:31,691
Fried dough! America's worst legal food!
Never leaves your body!

6
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:35,595
Wow. The Truth in Boardwalking Law
has really done a number on this place.

7
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:39,032
Shoot an oversized basketball
into an undersized hoop!

8
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:43,807
It's impossible!
The prizes have been here for 50 years!

9
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,870
HOMER: Ooh. Oh.

10
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:51,444
Maybe we should just check out
the street performers.

11
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:58,952
Big deal! I could juggle six pins
if they let me use a unicycle.

12
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:04,157
Well, if you think it's too easy,
why don't you throw me something else?

13
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,325
Are you insane?

14
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,194
You can't throw a little boy
into my cascade.

15
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,455
Stop tossing kids!

16
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,249
Oh, man. I love Saturdays.

17
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,603
Man, I love Saturdays.

18
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,814
Finally I can have fun
with something I bought for myself,

19
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,939
a new water heater.

20
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,286
Almost there...

21
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,880
Five more water heaters
and we get a free water heater.

22
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,535
Huh?

23
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,967
A mysterious door?

24
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,789
It's like a sauna in here.

25
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,040
It is a sauna in here!

26
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,786
It must've been put in
by a previous owner.

27
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:11,758
This house is full of surprises,
but this is the first good one.

28
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,043
I can't wait to tell everyone.

29
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,397
This is great, honey.

30
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:22,302
Thanks for telling me about it.
I hope you don't mind I invited Lenny.

31
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,305
And I hope you don't mind
I invited Carl and Moe.

32
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,308
Yeah, you know, my invitation
didn't say nothing about no towels.

33
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:32,378
So I guess we should all just go
Scandinavian, huh?

34
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,478
Huh?

35
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,551
Maybe I'll keep this
to myself for a while.

36
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,621
Ooh! Lamb kebob!

37
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:45,558
Ooh!

38
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,658
Chicken kebob.

39
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:48,761
Ooh!

40
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:49,863
Fire kebob!

41
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,963
Dad, no!
- Dad, yes!

42
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,033
Water! Thank you!

43
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:03,931
Why you little...

44
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,974
Burn, Barty, burn!

45
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,089
I'm afraid his tongue will be in that cast
for a few weeks.

46
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,625
It may put something of a cramp
in your lovemaking.

47
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:19,692
No, it won't.

48
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:24,552
If he wants me to do something,
he'll just write it down.

49
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,303
What does it say?
Is it complimentary?

50
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,505
Yeah, sure. It's complimentary.

51
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,515
It is? Hey, everybody!
Check out my compliment!

52
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,051
Now, Homer,
how would you like me to remove it?

53
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,151
Yanky or peely?

54
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,055
Got it.

55
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,395
I held up two for peely!
- I thought that was a Y for yanky!

56
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,298
I'll make a note in your chart
that you aren't always clear.

57
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,667
Well, at least I can eat again.

58
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,767
Cherry.

59
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,705
Too much cherry!

60
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,440
Lemon! That'll stop the cherry!

61
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,083
Doctor, why is this happening to me?
- Well, I do have an idea.

62
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,053
But just to be sure,
let's run some expensive tests.

63
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:28,419
The fire burned off your old taste buds,
exposing new ones.

64
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,167
That'll be our Christmas card this year.

65
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,736
Homer, you've become a supertaster.

66
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,405
The mildest spices
will overwhelm your tongue.

67
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,375
Even a taco could drive you insane.

68
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,578
I can't eat tacos?

69
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,637
Oh, my God. What day of mayo is it?
- Cinco.

70
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,488
Try these beets. I boiled all the red out.

71
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,376
I still taste overtones of pink.

72
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,924
Dad, I got the perfect thing.

73
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,897
Mmm. Hmm...

74
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:09,764
It feels like food,
but it has no flavor whatsoever.

75
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,472
It's mac and cheese
from the school cafeteria,

76
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,607
the blandest food known to man.

77
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,675
What else do they got?

78
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:20,235
Tofu cubes, tidy joes,
chili con cottage cheese,

79
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:23,683
pecan blandies, cream of steam,
you-guess-thems.

80
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,285
Man, who comes up with this stuff?

81
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,954
Old comedy writers
who now have to work at our kitchen.

82
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:32,892
The one rule we had on Charles in Charge
is, Charles must always be in charge.

83
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:36,362
Oh, yeah. That makes sense to me.
- That's a great rule.

84
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:39,329
Lunch card. Lunch card.

85
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:41,601
Lunch card.
- Don't have one.

86
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,236
Dad, what are you doing here?

87
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:47,807
Son, from now on, I'm eating all my meals
here at school with you!

88
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,676
What? No!

89
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,045
Come on. Relax. I won't embarrass you.

90
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,444
$3.85.
- Yeah.

91
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,185
Can I work it off? Don't worry.
I won't embarrass you!

92
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,410
I'll start you on Jell-O.

93
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,992
I'm big and yellow and I'm serving Jell-O

94
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,661
If you're a fellow
and you want some Jell-O

95
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,996
You better bellow

96
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,901
Hey, big guy! Give me some Jell-O

97
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:17,503
No Jell-O for you, Bart.
It'll keep you up at night,

98
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,840
like last week when you crawled into bed
with me and Mommy.

99
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,176
Sure is hot back here.

100
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,913
And there we go.

101
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,988
Don't worry. I won't embarrass you.

102
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,157
I used to date your daughter.

103
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,994
Buddy, I'm here to eat,
not make interesting conversation.

104
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:43,863
Dad, do you have to hang out
at my school?

105
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,332
It's bad enough
I have to be here three days a week.

106
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,237
Well! I know when I'm not wanted!

107
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,635
Am I wanted?
- No.

108
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,876
Hi. Homer Simpson.
Mind if I sit near your son? Mine sucks.

109
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,913
Well, we certainly are proud of Noah.
He's a straight-A student.

110
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:04,283
Noah! State capitals, alphabetical order,
on my clap.

111
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:09,480
Albany, Annapolis, Atlanta, Augusta,
Austin, Baton Rouge,

112
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:14,151
Bismarck, Boise, Boston,
Capital City, Carson City.

113
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,787
Wow. He's terrified of you.

114
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,533
That's why I'm here.
To make sure he gets good grades.

115
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,601
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

116
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:25,037
You come to school
to help him get good grades?

117
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:28,541
Isn't that why we pay public school
teachers those enormous salaries?

118
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,443
Well, call me over-involved,

119
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:33,813
but someday,
your son will be my son's chauffeur.

120
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:37,083
Well, I hope your son enjoys
being driven around...

121
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,886
...by the President of the United States.

122
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:43,322
Really? Let's see what the future
president's doing right now.

123
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:56,736
You don't see many presidents doing that.
Maybe LBJ, you know, at the end.

124
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,238
It's not your son's fault. It's yours.

125
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:02,442
You have to hover over your kid's shoulder
to force him to succeed.

126
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,277
It's called helicopter parenting.

127
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:08,881
I don't have to helicopter Bart.
I've got a backup plan called Lisa.

128
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:12,318
Oh, right. Your second grader.
Sure she's smart,

129
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:16,222
but how could she be successful
if she's not popular?

130
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,924
Do you mind if I join you?

131
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:22,195
Well, that depends. What are you eating?
- Baked potato, side salad, and a...

132
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,100
Well, we're having cold shoulder.

133
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:31,504
Is this seat taken?
- No. Go ahead. Take it.

134
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,172
Take it way over there.

135
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,444
Oh, my God.

136
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:44,142
My son's a loser
and my daughter's a Ioner.

137
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,250
Way to go, Marge!

138
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:52,124
Marge, where have you been?
- Well, I...

139
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:58,664
No time! I'll just deduce where you were
from a list of possibilities in my head.

140
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,733
That makes sense. Moving on.

141
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,896
If we don't get more
involved in their lives,

142
00:10:02,996 --> 00:10:04,637
Bart and Lisa are gonna be failures,

143
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:09,936
failures who work for Noah!
- Noah. I like that name.

144
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,376
Noah.

145
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,914
New-ah. Noah.

146
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,049
Aren't you the one
who usually worries about stuff?

147
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,684
Am I?

148
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:23,778
If Marge doesn't worry about the kids,
then that leaves me!

149
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,023
Help me, mayonnaise!

150
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:43,308
Look at all these helicopter parents.
I hope Bart's doing okay on his own.

151
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,682
There's no future in that!

152
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:50,783
Don't forget, children.

153
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,419
Monday is the balsa wood
model building competition.

154
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,922
The American Balsa Council
will award this year's winner...

155
00:10:56,022 --> 00:11:00,357
...a $1000 savings bond
for their college education.

156
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:04,085
$1000? That's what my house is worth.

157
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:07,066
Bart Simpson, what will you be making?

158
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,166
I don't know.

159
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:15,867
Time to take control of my son's life.
Let's see. What can he build?

160
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,044
Too obvious.

161
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,231
Gotta be something from earth.

162
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,784
You're no help!

163
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,853
Perfect.

164
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,837
'The Washington Monument?'

165
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:41,122
Washington Monument.
- I like Bart's idea.

166
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:44,203
You're not in this class.
- Willie swept me in here.

167
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,303
My mistake.

168
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,772
I did it. I helped my son.
Helicopter Homer, away!

169
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,316
Black Hawk down! Black Hawk down!

170
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,751
Lisa, I found this book...

171
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,320
...in the 'What's wrong with my daughter'
section of the bookstore.

172
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,522
It tells you how you can get popular.

173
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:06,659
Dad, if I join a clique,
I'll be the kind of person I hate.

174
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,128
Sweetie, our country was founded
by a clique,

175
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,565
the Continental Congress!
Dolphins swim in cliques.

176
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,700
Those are my two examples.

177
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,669
Well, they are good ones.

178
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:22,549
And to show you how this book works,
I will demonstrate on some rats.

179
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:28,981
Let's try
what chapter seven calls 'Unsults,'

180
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,684
insults disguised as compliments.

181
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,319
Hey, Lenny.

182
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:38,424
It takes a lot of courage to wear
suspenders when you're not in the circus.

183
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:42,695
Well, that's very nice of you... Hey!
Are you saying my clothes are clown-like?

184
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:46,298
Oh, God. I feel so insecure.
Please be my friend.

185
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,768
See? It works.
And unsults are just the beginning.

186
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:53,773
There's also 'Envytations,' 'Hate hugs,'
'Spamming with faint praise,' and...

187
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,609
Hey, everyone,
wanna go get frozen yogurt?

188
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,444
I do...
- Yeah!

189
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,947
I'm sorry, Moe.
I didn't mean 'everyone' everyone.

190
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:05,317
Hope you don't mind?
- No. That's all right.

191
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:15,774
If I didn't sell booze,
they probably wouldn't even come here!

192
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:21,200
And that, my dear girl,
is called the Toledo Take-back.

193
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,602
Dad, I don't want to
hurt people's feelings.

194
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:24,702
I see.

195
00:13:24,802 --> 00:13:27,406
Well, maybe you're not
ready for this book.

196
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:32,946
It is more of a big girl thing.
- I'm a big girl! I'm a big girl!

197
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,285
One of you said something bad
about the other.

198
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,087
He did?
- He did?

199
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,187
Son, you buy an awful
lot of airplane glue,

200
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,796
but you never buy any models.

201
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,126
Oh, right. Models.

202
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:57,760
One Messerschmitt 262, a '67 SS GTO,

203
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,780
an Alfred E. Neuman,
with interchangeable arms.

204
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:11,250
We'd like some balsa wood, please.
- Enough to build a Washington Monument.

205
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,752
What scale are you using?

206
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,121
What cologne are you wearing?
None of your business!

207
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,689
Now we'd like our Washington Monument...

208
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,658
...to be one-five hundredth
the size of the real one.

209
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,896
Washington Monument?
Aren't you gonna even try?

210
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,133
What do you mean? And who are you?
- I'm your son's principal.

211
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:30,336
And the Washington Monument is
the most uninspired model choice there is.

212
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,305
It's like saying,
'I don't care. My kid's a loser.'

213
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,007
But... You...

214
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,710
What's the hardest model there is?

215
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,146
That would be, Westminster Abbey.

216
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,849
Attention, parents, children
and childless weirdoes,

217
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:48,283
my son and I are going
to build Westminster Abbey!

218
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,857
You've gotta be crazy!
- Prepare to be frustrated.

219
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,527
You won't get past the north transept!

220
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,892
Hey, how hard can it be?

221
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:58,297
All we have to do is
follow the directions.

222
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,410
Marge, the boy and I
will be making Westminster Abbey.

223
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,071
Blabby's gonna build an abbey. Groovy.

224
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,716
But first, as part of
Operation Popularity,

225
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:21,453
Lisa and I are hosting a 'Decorate Your
Own Cell Phone' party in the backyard.

226
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:27,126
Britney and Caitlin are here!
Where's my spray-on tan?

227
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:33,692
Why do I always read the labels after?

228
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:38,437
Ladies, we've got it all.
Rhinestones, stickers, tassels,

229
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:42,274
everything to make those $100 phones
look like $5 toys!

230
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,778
Lisa, this party is twisted!
- You're fierce!

231
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,315
I've never been called fierce before.

232
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,518
Strident. Hectoring has been
tossed around.

233
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,486
Let me take a picture of you
for my cell phone.

234
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,055
I'll put you on my desktop.

235
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,023
I'm gonna make you my friend on Facebook.

236
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,825
Please confirm.
- Confirmed!

237
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,059
I am such a great parent to both my kids.

238
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:12,152
Hello, little girl. Who do you belong to?

239
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:19,178
Hey, boy. Why don't I do that for you?
- Isn't this supposed to be my project?

240
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,614
All the other parents
are doing it for their kids.

241
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:25,284
Now stand back and I'll take it from here.

242
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,517
A little further back.

243
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:33,548
Do you want me to watch and learn?
- No. That kind of creeps me out.

244
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:37,596
Must finish Poets' Corner
or Bart will work for Noah...

245
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,298
...with his hot mom.

246
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:51,238
That's not Henry VII! That's Henry VI!
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

247
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:55,593
Homer, don't give up
till you finish my dear abbey!

248
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,050
Geoffrey Chaucer?
What are you doing here?

249
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,518
Well, I'm buried here,

250
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,688
and I want to tell you you're right
to do all Bart's work for him.

251
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,857
It's the best thing for the boy.

252
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,659
That's terrible advice.

253
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,060
Anne of Cleves?

254
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,897
What you do for your son,
he'll never learn to do for himself.

255
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:14,667
And where is this delightful boy?

256
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:15,901
Oscar Wilde?

257
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:19,071
Homer, there are only
two tragedies in life.

258
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:22,908
One is not getting what one wants,
and the other is getting it.

259
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,510
But that makes no sense!

260
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,781
Experience is simply
the name we give to our mistakes.

261
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:29,882
Shut up!

262
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:34,353
These days, man knows the price
of everything and the value of nothing.

263
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,748
Whatever happened to 'boo'?

264
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:55,708
Now we could smash the real
Westminster Abbey so it looks like this.

265
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:59,505
There are no flights to London
till 5:00.

266
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:06,218
Welcome to Springfield Elementary's
Next Top Model Building Contest.

267
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:10,414
Kenny, he said your show.
- I watched it once!

268
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,442
Now, judges, start your nodding.

269
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,228
Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm.

270
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,930
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

271
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,799
Flawless. Stunning. Awe-inspiring.

272
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,899
Meticulous.

273
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,202
Mmm?

274
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,472
Hmm.

275
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,906
Skinner!

276
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:33,579
These models are clearly
the work of meddling parents.

277
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,549
The only entry that repels my eye enough...

278
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:39,518
...to be constructed by
a student is this one.

279
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:43,489
Congratulations, son.
At least you followed the rules.

280
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:48,788
Yes! Yes! In your face, losers!
This helicopter is taking off!

281
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,295
No! Stop the hovering!

282
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:00,406
I didn't make this terrible model.
My dad did.

283
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:04,009
Why can't you guys
let us do things for ourselves?

284
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,547
In the words of Oscar
Wilde, 'Experience is...

285
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:08,814
...simply the name we
give to our mistakes.'

286
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,416
I saw him, too, Dad.

287
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,417
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

288
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:18,057
From now on, the only thing I'll ever do
for you is cosign if you want a gun.

289
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,125
Well, at least I made Lisa popular.

290
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,819
'I H8 this'?

291
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,868
I'm sorry, Dad.
These girls are nice on the surface.

292
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:34,206
But it's hard work staying this shallow.
I hope you understand.

293
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,241
Yeah. It's clear to me now.

294
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:40,179
The best thing I can do as a parent
is simply check out.

295
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,947
No, there's a middle ground.

296
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:45,071
Lisa, a light bulb is
either on or it's off.

297
00:19:45,171 --> 00:19:47,286
Not if you use a dimmer switch.

298
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:52,231
That's what the dimmer switch companies
want you to think.

299
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:57,730
What's wrong, Homie?
- I tried to fix the kids' lives.

300
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:03,836
But instead, I led them to rich and
rewarding personal decisions of their own.

301
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:09,169
Well, I know a place in this house
where you can really relax.

302
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,643
The mattress the dog sleeps on
in the cellar?

303
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,847
No. I gave that to the homeless shelter.

304
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:20,486
That was stuffed with cash!
- Well, I'll make you forget all about it.

305
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,248
Feeling better, Super Dad?
- Oh, yeah.

306
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,215
I feel like I've died and gone to hell.

307
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,842
The Simpsons
