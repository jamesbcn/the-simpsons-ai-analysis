{\an8}Concrete in the sandbox?

16
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,681
{\an8}I don't get lost anymore!

00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,893
{\an8}Spreading the rumor that today's lunch
would be served by a naked lady.

18
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,354
{\an8}-Move it!
-Boobs! Boobs!

19
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,524
{\an8}I want to see boobs in the soup!

20
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,353
{\an8}There is no naked lunch lady!
Bart made it up!

21
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,608
{\an8}Yes, yes, I-I knew that.

22
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,360
{\an8}There's no hope for you, Simpson.

23
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,532
{\an8}You'll be locked in detention
until you graduate to the penal system.

24
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,202
{\an8}(laughs) Penal.

25
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,120
{\an8}Stop laughing!
I said "penal," not "penile."

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,910
{\an8}(laughs) Penile.

27
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,163

{\an8}-Stick your finger in that desk.
-Really, Bart?

34
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,780
{\an8}Hmm, looks like ancient Aramaic.

35
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,122

{\an8}Hey, pal, what are you in here for?

50

{\an8}Heresies, like Docetism.

51
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,280
{\an8}Docetism?

52
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,783
{\an8}The belief that Jesus' body
was just an illusion.

53
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,906
{\an8}-Is that still big?
-Haw haw!

54
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,543
{\an8}Your heresies were venialized
by the council of Palermo.

Oh, shut up, shut up, shut up!

59
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,668
...your bleeding eyes with finger-legs.

60
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,086
And all the girls are mean girls.

61
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,046
Red dress, how original.

62
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,346
Making fun of someone's clothes,
how original.

63
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,270
Huh. You want to walk with us?

64
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,774
It's true.

65
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,982
It would be a cold day in Hell
when I was popular.

66
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,231
Huh?

67
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,147
Young man, where's your Hell pass?

68
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,735
Skin him!

69
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,200
Whoa. (gasps)

70
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,871
-(grunts)
-Huh?

71
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,370
Hmm.

72
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,873
So, what would be
the appropriate eternal torture

73
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,126
for someone who robbed a bank?

74
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,706
-(flame whooshing)
-(groans)

75
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,337
Someone who robs a bank.

76
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,764
How would you punish them
for all time?

77
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,393
Mm... Jeffistopheles?

78
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,220
(in squeaky voice)
Uh... wh-whipping?

79
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,925
Okay. Good.

80
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,555
No one likes to be whipped,

81
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,812
but is there anything
more connected to the sin?

82
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,855
Torture?

83
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,939
What if you made the robber
eat bags of money

84
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,525
until his stomach exploded?

85
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,150
Good. Very good.

86
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,357
-(high-pitched whooshing)
-Mm.

87
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,027
Psychological torment.

88
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,575
Pain plus fear.

89
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,369
Oh, can you all feel
how much richer that is?

90
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,793
You get a pumpkin sticker.

91
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,371
Ow.

92
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,286
(gasps)
This has never happened before.

93
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,875
I have a crush on my teacher!

94
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,210
Down here,
we can make that happen.

95
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,632
(both giggle)

96
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,716
Every time the sinner screams in pain,

97
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,602
the scream blows this windmill,

98
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,639
which pumps even more piranhas
into his aquarium underwear,

99
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,683
-causing more screaming.
-Wow. Wow.

100
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,807
Oh, that is so evil.

101
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,404
And I know evil.
I'm head of the teachers' union.

102
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,820
(bell ringing)

103
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,278
(grunting and groaning)

104
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,859
Bart, I found a portal back to Earth.

105
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,120
Right here?

106
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,948
No, no, no, no!
That's Super Hell!

107
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,576
Hot Stuff?
I didn't realize you were that evil.

108
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:52,292
(à la Droopy) No, I'm being punished
for how lame my comics were.

109
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,535
(whooshing)

110
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,126
I melted it. Get it?

111
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,382
(bird caws)

112
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,804
Welcome to Earth.
Local time is 10:37.

113
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,506
We know you have
your choice of portals,

114
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,766
so thank you for choosing
the Burns Hellport,

115
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,729
a division of Gulf and Western.

116
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,019
-Mom, Dad, I want to change schools.
-HOMER: Hmm?!

117
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,355
I found a place
that really wants to teach me,

118
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,031
and I really want to learn.

119
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,649
Homie, our prayers have been answered.

120
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,407
Keep your pants on, Marge.

121
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,118
It's probably some private school

122
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,948
that costs a million dollars a year,

123
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,834
and then they squeeze you
for extra money

124
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,160
through book fairs and silent auctions.

125
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,956
And parents get 20 e-mails a day
from the school,

126
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,631
and everyone hits
"reply all" to everything.

127
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,250
Dad, it's not a private school.
It's free.

128
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,048
Oh, that's fine then.

129
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,721
(man screams)

130
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:45,049
I couldn't help noticing
this school is located in--

131
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,256
I'm not one to judge, but, um...

132
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,967
I'll say it, Marge. It's in Hell!

133
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,308
The Inferno! Perdition!

134
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,403
Arizona without the golf!

135
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,939
No. We do have golf,
but all the greens are tricky.

136
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,194
-No!
-Look, as educators,

137
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:04,156
our job is to gently nurture
your child's passion.

138
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:07,698
Hmm. That is the kind of nonsense
you're always falling for.

139
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,334
Mom, please tell me
I can go to Hell.

140
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:13,661
Well, I guess we could
try it for a semester.

141
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,248
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

142
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,634
You know, we have many opportunities
for parent involvement.

143
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,922
(scoffs) Yeah, I'll be sure
to take a look at that.

144
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,429

and none of you wants
to repeat the class

156
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,603
like a certain student
I don't want to embarrass.

157
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,969
-Torture?
-(groans)

158
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,846
Beelzebart, you're first.

159
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,903
And you're going to torment
a very special sinner

160
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,270
we've prepared just for you.

161
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,153
Homer?

162
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,654
That-That's my dad.

163
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,985
I can't hurt him.

164
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,070
No, boy. I want you to do it.

165
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,486
What? Why?

166
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,994
Bart, you went to Hell

167
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,905
and came back a winner,
like Jesus.

168
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:37,245
Now, come on, boy.
Pull me apart like string cheese.

169
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,382
D'oh! D'oh! (shrieks)

170
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,179
Webster defines success as the action
of achieving one's goals.

171
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,628
Don't you, Webster?

172
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:52,258
I don't care! Why am I here?

173
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,016
You changed the "R-E"
to "E-R" in "theater."

174
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,179
I hate that!

175
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,227
Well, I'll tell you

pull up your pants, dude.

348
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,615
I'll crack you!

349
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,793
-(grunting)
-(chuckling)

350
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,251
What kind of afterlife is this?

351
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,632
Can't even strangle my dead kid.

352
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,630
So, yeah, things aren't perfect
with the missus and me,

353
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,554
and, uh, by the way, nice melons.

354
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,893
Those are in the kitchen!

355
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:55,719
D'oh! I can't believe you wasted
our money on fruit!

356
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,556
-(purring)
-Homer Simpson!

357
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,482
-Can you be more specific?
-(growling)

358
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,101
(both chuckling)

359
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,687
-(giggles)
-Mmm!

360
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,569
(grumbles)

361
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,240
There's no reason to be jealous.

362
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,738
It's just younger you.

363
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,240
Oh! So, he likes ghosts better, eh?

364
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,783
Fine.

365
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,827
Hmm.

366
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,449
Might as well clean this
while I'm killing myself.

367
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,707
(grunting)

368
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,749
(thud)

369
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,332
(humming a tune) Hmm?

370
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,588
Well, hello-ho-ho.

371
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,005
-Aah! A ghost!
-I feel like a ghost,

372
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,050
the way you haven't been
paying attention to me.

373
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,264
Plus, I'm dead.

374
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,183
Don't yell at me--
I'm a double widower.

375
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,352
But I can handle all the ghosts
you can float at me.

376
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,602
Won't the other Homer be a problem?

377
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,854
Heh! I think he gets it.

378
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,686
-See? He...
-You stupid...

379
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,402
What the... Ooh!

380
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,732
Mmm, I smell toast.

381
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,147
(groans)

382
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,275
(whoosh)

383
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,989
Well, I guess you and I
are in charge now, Bart.

384
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,334
But if we split the chores,
I'm sure that we c...

385
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,199
-What are you doing?!
-Sayonara, sucker!

386
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,707
Oh, no, you're not leaving me
to clean this up!

387
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,290
(yells, grunts)

388
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,132
Whoo-hoo!
I'm the last of the Simpsons!

389
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,343
In I.Q. only!

390
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,763
Huh?

391
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,049
(grunts, coughs, groans)

392
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,559
GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE:
Thank you!

393
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,063
Willie's got stew for the winter.

394
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,562
Wait a minute-- who killed Maggie?

395
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:31,191
This is all your fault, Homer,
for wanting somebody new.

396
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,316
I just wanted the woman I married.

397
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:36,413
I never realized you had
so much work done.

398
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,410
-Simpsons, please!
-This fighting solves nothing!

399
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,623
Dr. Marvin Monroe?!

400
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,083
Are you alive or dead?

401
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,253
(groans)
I'm in some horrible limbo.

402
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,462
I can walk halfway through walls,
then I get stuck.

403
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,253
-(creaking)
-Uh-oh.

404
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,006
Now I'm gonna have to look
at that every morning.

405
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,419
Well, I think you're helping us
make progress.

406
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:57,258
-Thank you.
-Let's not fight anymore.

407
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,724
Let's just make him decide between us.

408
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,055
Choose me because I'm not bitter yet,

409
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,642
I can stay up later,

410
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,226
and you're on my mind all the time.

411
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,732
Hmm, Marge number two,
how would you win my whoopie?

412
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,106
Those are great reasons,

413
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,612
but there's one reason
you should choose me--

414
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,655
because I know everything you've done,

415
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,199
and yet I still want to be with you.

416
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,454
That is so beautiful.

417
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,036
(both sigh)

418
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,541
You're right, Marge,
I could never leave you,

419
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,753
not even for you.

420
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,383
If there was a dot
or a squiggle different,

421
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,170
that would be too much.

422
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,174
-Oh, Homie!
-Oh, Homie!

423
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,716
(all moaning)

424
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,139

I just had a worrisome thought.

If there can be two incarnations
of the Simpsons,

432
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,153
why couldn't
some evil marketing entity

433
