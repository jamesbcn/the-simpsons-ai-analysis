1
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,473
What, too soon?

2
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,908
D'oh!

3
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:46,680
Avast there.

4
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:48,982
It be too late
to alter course, matey.

5
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,019
And there be pirates
lurking in every cove.

6
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,020
Get to the ride.

7
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,625
Did they get a picture?

8
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:09,102
Welcome to our first-ever night
of dramatic scenes

9
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,071
written by our students.

10
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:14,341
Should we silence
our cell phones and pagers?

11
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,943
No, no, no, please,
I beg you, leave them on.

12
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,111
And here's some candy
to unwrap.

13
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:24,084
And now, a new scene
from the CW's Riverdale.

14
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,989
Jughead, there's been a murder
at Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe

15
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:31,391
and it's up to us kids
to solve it.

16
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,393
I can't deal with that
right now.

17
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,963
My dad's in jail
and the only way to get him out

18
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,965
is to try drugs.

19
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:41,068
We're both pregnant
with Big Moose's babies.

20
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,974
Wait. So this is a play
based on a YouTube

21
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,409
of kids playing a video game?

22
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,979
- That's right.
- It's about time.

23
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,915
Okay, to get their chug jugs,
I could snipe these guys out

24
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:58,085
one by one, but the smarter move
is to plant a charge

25
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,886
at the base of their
attack platform

26
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,688
and skull-splat 'em
when they land.

27
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,957
Hey, guys, if you want more
game hacks like this,

28
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:07,794
be sure to smash our like button
and subscribe to our channel.

29
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,364
Up next, night vision fails.

30
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,832
How is this a play?

31
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,333
Well, sir, video game
walk-throughs

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,136
are the only narrative most of
these kids have been exposed to.

33
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:18,905
- This is their Becket.
- Who?

34
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,874
Are you Terry Bradshaw?

35
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:24,011
No. It's Donny Osmond.

36
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,246
Boner. Boner from Growing Pains.

37
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,349
You're all wrong.
My real identity is...

38
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,884
Flavor Flav!

39
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,387
Flavor Flav? I've heard of you.

40
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,222
I've heard of you so much.

41
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:38,859
I am such a huge fan
of your movies, books, or music.

42
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,094
I can also pretend
to be impressed.

43
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,562
The end.

44
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,299
Wake up.
Lisa's next.

45
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,636
Oh, no, please.
I'm having the best dream.

46
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,439
I was in my warm, cozy grave.

47
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,776
Well, I'm gonna dream about me
in a soft, cuddly crypt.

48
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,379
Yeah...

49
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:02,315
Amazingly, this next piece
is not based on something

50
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,017
you watch on your phone
or a gas pump,

51
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:06,053
but is actually
an honest-to-goodness play,

52
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,955
by Lisa, Thank God
You're a Throwback, Simpson.

53
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,290
And so I give you

54
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,926
Long Day's Journey
Into Light Beer.

55
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,896
Where's my beer, Marjorie?

56
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:19,700
I spent all day making sure
this beer was cold.

57
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:23,236
I make bad choices.

58
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,205
Lisa's really nailed
the Hibberts.

59
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,909
Yo, dude, my catchphrases

60
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,978
are as outdated as my slingshot.

61
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,447
Ay, caramba!

62
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:36,783
Oh, Mom, it's so hard being
a straight-A student

63
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,953
with a social conscience
who writes amazing plays.

64
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,422
The only stable thing
in this house is you,

65
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,958
making every day
the same as the last.

66
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,860
Exactly the same.

67
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,862
Like the coffee maker says,

68
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,630
things will perk up.

69
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,866
I thought you were
the coffee maker.

70
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,268
You can learn a lot
from percolators.

71
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,971
Make the most
of the daily grind.

72
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:01,041
The mother character
is such a snooze.

73
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,076
Ralph has nothing
to play against.

74
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,078
They think I'm boring.

75
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,280
This play is about us!

76
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,417
Today I decided
to be a race car driver,

77
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,452
so I was, then I quit.

78
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,921
I also have exciting news.

79
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,923
I converted four soap slivers

80
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,326
into practically a new bar.

81
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,295
Is this how the world sees me,
as a...

82
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,498
How do the kids say lame-o
these days?

83
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,767
We say lame-o, you lame-o.

84
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,836
Suck, suck.
And I felt like the ghost

85
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,471
belonging to the fog.

86
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:34,040
And the fog was the ghost
of the sea.

87
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,642
Suck, suck.

88
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,550
You really think
I'm that boring?

89
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,052
Lisa, you made someone feel sad,

90
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,356
which is not what a drama about
a family is supposed to do.

91
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,091
Marge, could we get a picture?

92
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,893
Okay.

93
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,899
So all the generations...

94
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,034
Boring.
They think I'm boring.

95
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,869
I'll show them who's boring.

96
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:06,339
Now, this morning, Marge Simpson
has insistently volunteered

97
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,674
to read a passage.

98
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:10,477
She says she's gonna
bring her own spin to it.

99
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:14,881
Now, a reading from John, 18:38,

100
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,350
between Pontius Pilate
and Jesus.

101
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,019
Marge! Marge! Marge!

102
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,887
Hey-a Jesus,

103
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,088
what's a matter for you?

104
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,723
You saying youse a king?

105
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,160
He was Roman,
that's why I'm doing the accent.

106
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:32,933
Anyhoo, Jesus answered,
and I think it might have gone

107
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,601
something like this.

108
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,937
I'm not a king, I'm a carpenter.

109
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,338
A Jewish carpenter.

110
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:41,107
The only thing I nail
are my SATs.

111
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,343
So then, Pontius says
to the elders...

112
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,947
This-a Jesus,
he-a look like a nice-a guy.

113
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,748
Nobody talk-a like-a that.

114
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,183
I make a nice-a sentence.

115
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,552
Just like-a Mama
used to construct.

116
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:56,089
Can we just hear
Lovejoy's sermon, please?

117
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:57,591
Yeah, Marge, read the room.

118
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,829
You need this more
than we do, lady.

119
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:17,010
Boring. That's what this
straight-A Girl Scout

120
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,879
has become... boring.

121
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,919
You just had
a near-death experience.

122
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,120
That's exciting.

123
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:30,290
What a rich life
you lead, Mom.

124
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,159
I'm going to bed.

125
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,463
That will really turn around
your boring reputation.

126
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,022
Don't worry, Homer,
I'll chop the wood.

127
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,490
Like always.

128
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,725
I have to do everything.

129
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,093
Even chop the trees.

130
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,938
I know where she can put
that chopping to good use.

131
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,439
Homer's neck?

132
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,742
No. He doesn't have one.
Something better.

133
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,280
Lower your right hand.
Gives you more power.

134
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,284
Thanks...

135
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:32,953
Paula.
Friend of Patty's.

136
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,654
We met at Burning Woman.

137
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:35,922
Nice job on that wood.

138
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,624
I helped.

139
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,693
Yeah, you helped, all right.

140
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,828
You helped that hammock
kiss the ground.

141
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,296
D'oh.

142
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:44,998
Marge, I don't know
if you know this,

143
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,567
but I'm a top-level contender
at Timbersports.

144
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,135
That's so interesting.

145
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,705
How does it feel
to be magnificent?

146
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:52,939
I'll show you.

147
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,809
<i>The only card I need
is the ace of spades</i>

148
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,911
<i>The ace of spades</i>

149
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,949
That is a fascinating hobby.

150
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,585
Timbersports
is more than a hobby.

151
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,355
It's an unpaid passion
that you do in your spare time.

152
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,690
Now, we're going to the woods.

153
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,129
- What are you doing?
- Breathing.

154
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,698
Breathing for the first time
in my life.

155
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,337
Can I do one thing

156
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,039
for the knots in your shoulders?

157
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,007
Sure.

158
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:32,379
Not so...

159
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,914
Now, to motivate your chopping,

160
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,385
think of things
that make you mad.

161
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,021
Oh, nothing really makes me mad.

162
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:44,257
Mom, Lisa won't stay on her side
of the thought bubble.

163
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,562
You have five seconds to live.

164
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,399
So do you, idiot.
We're in the same bubble.

165
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,267
My final words are Lisa sucks!

166
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:59,139
She's a natural.

167
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,078
<i>I walked into the forest</i>

168
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,847
<i>So beautiful and green</i>

169
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,482
<i>And there I saw a woman</i>

170
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,685
<i>Who was chopping down a tree</i>

171
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,055
<i>The sawdust was flyin'</i>

172
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,624
<i>She was spinnin' on a log</i>

173
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,626
<i>On her waist was strapped
a tool belt</i>

174
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:23,263
<i>With a Black & Decker saw</i>

175
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,865
<i>Vroom, vroom, pull the cord</i>

176
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,601
<i>Buzz, buzz, just one more</i>

177
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,870
<i>Roar, roar, what a thrill</i>

178
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,473
<i>With Lumberjill</i>

179
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,109
<i>Vroom, vroom, pull the cord</i>

180
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,745
<i>Buzz, buzz, just one more</i>

181
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:41,214
<i>Roar, roar, what a thrill</i>

182
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:45,218
<i>With Lumberjill</i>

183
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,866
I'm Chip Bunyan
and welcome

184
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,502
to the Springfield
Timbersports Pro-Am.

185
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:05,972
I'm here with former
NBA analyst Anger Watkins.

186
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:09,476
Timbersports.
Timber sports?

187
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:13,146
I snap one P.A.'s bra strap,
and this is where I land?

188
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,982
Who is the Lebron of this thing?
No one will tell me.

189
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,684
His name is Matt Cogar.

190
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,486
Is his nickname The Cougar?

191
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,454
No, his nickname is Matt.

192
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:22,722
Matt isn't a nickname.

193
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,324
It's a name name.

194
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,559
I'd storm out of here right now

195
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,761
if I weren't so terrified
of squirrels.

196
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,530
Take my money!
Take it!

197
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:33,032
I'm glad Mom's found a passion,

198
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,268
but I wish she didn't
have to kill all those trees.

199
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:38,071
I read that trees are the cause
of global warming.

200
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,939
Where'd you read that?

201
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,942
My new fourth grade
science book.

202
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:52,085
And they're off, displaying
lots of forest gumption, eh?

203
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,586
First we have Nelson Muntz.

204
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,357
He's ten years old,
but, man, is it a hard ten.

205
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,897
Hey. That's my boy.

206
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,233
He gets his pole skills
from his mama.

207
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:15,241
Marge Simpson
takes the lead!

208
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:19,212
No one saw this coming,
because no one was watching.

209
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,016
What could
possibly be her motivation?

210
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,419
I'm not boring!

211
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:36,396
You magnificent she-beast.

212
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,332
All our sweaty passion
and grunting

213
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,967
paid off.

214
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,836
Now's the time
I should tell you. Paula is gay.

215
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,606
She made a friend.

216
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,108
You've made me a new woman.

217
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,110
Should I be concerned?

218
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:54,614
It's no weirder than that time
our knees touched under the bar.

219
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,149
You still think about that?

220
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,318
Every day.

221
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,956
I haven't been
this happy in a long time.

222
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:06,626
You were great,
but I have a question.

223
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,461
Do you want to take it
to the next level?

224
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:09,729
What do you mean?

225
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,931
Will you ride the blade with me?

226
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:14,801
You know, help me bow
the jagged-toothed fiddle?

227
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,069
I don't understand.

228
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,504
Draw and drag
the sequoia widow-maker.

229
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,007
You're gonna have to tell me
what you're talking about.

230
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,510
Will you be my partner
on the double-ended bucksaw?

231
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,113
You really think
that I have what it takes?

232
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,414
I know you do.

233
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,483
But if we do this,

234
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,319
you'll have to train with me
for a month, in Portland.

235
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:36,956
A month? Oh, no,
I can't leave Homer that long.

236
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,243
Fantasies can be good?

237
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,914
Good to have you back.

238
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,953
Boy, am I beat.

239
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,955
Homie, I feel like

240
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:11,491
I'm my very best self
in these competitions.

241
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,026
You are, honey.

242
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:16,963
In a way I could never
make you feel or comprehend.

243
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,498
Paula wants me
to train with her.

244
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,966
If I do,
I'll be gone for a month.

245
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,902
A month? We've never
been apart that long.

246
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,338
I miss you when we're separated
in a revolving door.

247
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,874
I miss you when I'm putting
a sweater over my head.

248
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,143
I miss you when I close my eyes
during a sneeze.

249
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,912
I miss you when the clock
springs ahead an hour.

250
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,014
We'll never get that time back.

251
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:37,317
Homer, do you really
want me to stay,

252
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,819
knowing how much I need this

253
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,921
to feel good about myself?

254
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,389
Yes, I do.

255
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,325
What? What?

256
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,127
Where you going? She might leave
and never come back.

257
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,129
Just like the McRib.

258
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,974
<i>You feel it all</i>

259
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,811
<i>Around yourself</i>

260
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,552
I forgot to unlock the door.

261
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,854
God, how insulting to people.

262
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,923
So nervous about
seeing your mother.

263
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,925
Let's just enjoy Portland.

264
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,194
I mean, I can't believe
we've never been here before.

265
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,863
Indigenous artworks,
craft breweries,

266
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,231
independent movie theaters...

267
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,700
and that's just
in one coffee shop.

268
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,872
Comic Book Guy?

269
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,874
Yes, I often come here
to recharge.

270
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,910
In Portland I'm quirky,
rather than objectionable.

271
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,145
Do you sell comic books here?

272
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,914
No. Marijuana.
And artisanal salami.

273
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,950
Laced with marijuana.

274
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,196
Stupid Flanders Street.

275
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,966
Okay, this is where your mom is.

276
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,234
Help me get her back.

277
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,404
Please help me get her back.

278
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,473
Hello, Nicolas Cage.

279
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,310
Dad, she's gonna know
that's not your real hair.

280
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,614
You've got to have a modicum
of faith in who you are.

281
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,115
It's a snap.

282
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,619
Cool.

283
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,888
Welcome, new friend,

284
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,256
whoever you are.

285
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,057
Homie!

286
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,893
You're here a day early.

287
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,895
Mom!

288
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,198
Oh, I've missed you all
so much.

289
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,033
How are you guys?

290
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,836
We were,
of course, unraveling.

291
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:40,106
Bart, Lisa, your grampa
is taking good care of you.

292
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:41,874
Now where's the baby?

293
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,878
Good girl.

294
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,347
I like what you're wearing.

295
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,783
Thank you. These are
locally-sourced dungarees

296
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,518
and Pendleton flannel.

297
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:55,555
It's what Jill Sobule wore when
she played the Crystal Ballroom.

298
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,557
Jill Sobule?

299
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,127
Like every other place we go,
I love Portland.

300
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,429
So much,
I want to leave Springfield

301
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,965
until I find out something bad
that makes me realize

302
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,100
that there's no place like home.

303
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,870
Now, now, your mother
has not settled in here.

304
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,371
Welcome.

305
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,341
These are our pugs,
Nike and Swoosh.

306
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:34,894
Marjorie, could you and I
have a word in the backyard?

307
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,829
Don't you see
what's happening here?

308
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:39,398
- You're married.
- Yes, I know.

309
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,835
- To you.
- No, to her. Look around.

310
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:45,371
You're married in the two
most important ways there are.

311
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,907
Emotionally and cooking.

312
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:50,409
That's ridiculous.

313
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,912
You're fostering pugs.

314
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:55,047
They remind me of you.

315
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,717
But I am upset.
I'm finally good at something

316
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,785
and you have to be jealous.

317
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,954
Marge, sweetie,
I'm really proud of you.

318
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,456
I'm not jealous or mad.

319
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,125
It's just...
when are you coming home?

320
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,995
Tomorrow, after the competition.

321
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,830
Woo-hoo! I win.

322
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:13,065
Not that I was nervous.

323
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,872
Unless we win, in which case,

324
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,375
I might stay
and prep for the finals.

325
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,177
Marge, I've backed you
in this from day one.

326
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,879
No, you haven't.
Not a bit.

327
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:29,448
Then it's too late to start now.

328
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,622
Oh, I'm sitting in a bar

329
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:39,425
and my wife's in love
with a female lumberjack.

330
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,360
Classic Portland.
Where are you from?

331
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,862
Springfield.

332
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,498
- Which one? Oregon?
- I don't know.

333
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,600
Welcome back
to the Grizzly Timbersports

334
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,602
Northwest Championship Finals,

335
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,604
brought to you by no one.

336
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:52,905
Still looking.

337
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,943
Marge and Paula are in control.

338
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,178
I am falling in love
with this sport.

339
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,681
And when I fall, I fall hard.

340
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,950
I'm taking you home with me.

341
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,753
Hold the Stella, fella.

342
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,890
Carol "Oak" Connor
and Rachel "The Pine" Cohen

343
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,925
have taken command.

344
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:17,530
I can't be silent anymore.
Let me through.

345
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,332
There's plenty of room.

346
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,634
Marge, I was a lumber-jerk.

347
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,502
I'm only happy if you're happy.

348
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,504
Our love is like an old tree.

349
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:29,241
If you cut it down,
it grows back stronger.

350
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,943
That's not how trees work.

351
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,347
Well, according to my book,
it is.

352
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:40,019
Yay! All right.

353
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,821
I love this sport!

354
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:45,858
And maybe now I can
love my lumberjack son.

355
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,862
Ladies and gentlemen,
our grand champion

356
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:53,399
and winner of a Bass Pro Shops
$50 gift card,

357
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,667
Marge Simpson.

358
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:58,037
All right, champ!

359
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,805
See you in the showers.

360
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,842
Congratulations, Paula.
You won.

361
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,478
Enjoy the hell out of her.

362
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,481
Homer, what is it
you think that I've won?

363
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,182
With me, Marge is a good woman.

364
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,919
With you, Marge is a great woman
with two awesome dogs.

365
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,688
I'm not interested in Marge.

366
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:18,524
- I have a wife and a kid.
- You have a wife?

367
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,793
She's in Tokyo,
training for the Olympics.

368
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,628
She dances...

369
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:23,929
with the ribbons?

370
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,431
I don't know what it's called.

371
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,733
So you're not breaking us up?

372
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,336
No. I mean, I'll miss her
on the other end of the bucksaw,

373
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:34,040
and I'll really miss
that $80 grand prize money,

374
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,976
but she's welcome to come up
here and train any time.

375
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,645
I am so grateful.
I want to do something for you.

376
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:40,980
If you'd like another kid,

377
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:43,849
I am more than happy
to offer up my sperm.

378
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,918
That's very kind, but...

379
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,920
No really, I've always
wanted to have a kid

380
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,889
with no responsibilities.

381
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,657
All right.
You're in the top three.

382
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:54,727
It's you, the track star
or the Harvard professor.

383
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:55,995
Oh, I get it.

384
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:57,830
Instead of sperm,
would you like semen?

385
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:00,933
- They're the same thing.
- They are?

386
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,935
Oh, it still feels weird.

387
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,904
I don't know what to say to her.

388
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:09,075
I never would've
thought of that.

389
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,077
Honey, would you like
to come home?

390
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,312
Okay.

391
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:19,652
Your daddy loves you, sweetie.
He wants to make sure

392
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,588
you're always a strong,
confident little lady.

393
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,990
So I went out and got you this.

394
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,833
Aw, her baby head fell out.

395
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,769
You'll be getting a visit
from the Head Fairy.

396
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,976
<i>I walked out of the forest</i>

397
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,345
<i>Before we said goodbye</i>

398
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,348
<i>The birds were all a-singing</i>

399
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,350
<i>As she pointed to the sky</i>

400
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,353
<i>She said,
can't you see the rainbow?</i>

401
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,289
<i>They made it just for you</i>

402
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,191
<i>She handed me her toolbox</i>

403
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,961
<i>Said, now you know
what to do</i>

404
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,830
<i>Vroom, vroom, pull the cord</i>

405
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:07,600
<i>Buzz, buzz, just one more</i>

406
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,269
<i>Roar, roar, what a thrill</i>

407
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:12,972
<i>With Lumberjill</i>

408
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,007
<i>Vroom, vroom, pull the cord</i>

409
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,676
<i>Buzz, buzz, just one more</i>

410
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,379
<i>Roar, roar, what a thrill</i>

411
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,983
<i>With Lumberjill</i>
