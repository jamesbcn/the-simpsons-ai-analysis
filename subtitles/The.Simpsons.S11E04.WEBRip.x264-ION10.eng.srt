00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:06,593
ANNOUNCER: <i>Live</i>
<i>from fabulous Centauri City.</i>

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,633
<i>It's the Simpsons Tenth Halloween Special.</i>

3
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,851
<i>Now, please welcome your hosts,</i>

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,465
<i>If you haven't been probed by these two,</i>

5
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,426
<i>you haven't been probed.</i>

6
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,476
<i>Kang and Kodos.</i>

7
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,561
(crowd cheering)

8
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,614
(smacking lips loudly)

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,781
Thank you. Thank you.

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,779
Yes, thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

11
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,201
Welcome to our tenth anniversary show.

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,240
Oh, we've got a great--

13
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,243
Kang, what are you doing?

14
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,998
Well, you said we were
going to warm up the audience.

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,079
(canned laughter)

16
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,498
(grunts) Ladies and gentlemen

17
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,955
I have to apologize for my partner.

18
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,376
He had to borrow a human brain.

19
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,465
(canned laughter and applause)

20
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,506
{\an8}What do aliens have to do with Halloween?

21
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,595
{\an8}(man's voice) Silence.

22
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,901
(tires screeching)

23
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,793
I still can't believe we escaped
from those horrible vampires.

24
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,948
But it was worth it to get back our

25
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,997
Super Sugar Crisp cereal.

26
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,921
<i>♪ Can't get enough</i>
<i>with that Sugar Crisp... ♪</i>

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
{\an8}I'm having a hard time seeing.

28
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:29,007
{\an8}Homer, did you remember
to put the fog lights in?

29
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,219
{\an8}<i>♪ Guess I forgot</i>
<i>to put the fog lights in ♪</i>

30
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,339
{\an8}I better pull over and play it safe.

31
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,596
{\an8}(loud thud)

32
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,058
{\an8}(gasps)

33
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,178
{\an8}Please be a dog.

{\an8}(gasping)

35
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,386
{\an8}Oh, no!

36
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,726
{\an8}Ned Flanders.

37
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,944
{\an8}-(squish)
-He's dead.

38
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,403
{\an8}(squishing)

39
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,904
{\an8}He's definitely dead.

40
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,491
{\an8}(squishing)

41
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,740
{\an8}Oh, my God.

42
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,822
{\an8}We killed Ned Flanders.

43
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,777
{\an8}You mean, <i>you </i>killed Ned Flanders.

44
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,287
{\an8}Oh, it was an accident. An accident!

45
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,120
{\an8}We got to go to the police.

46
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,035
{\an8}They'll never believe
a Simpson killed a Flanders

47
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,294
by accident.

48
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,915
{\an8}Even I have my doubts.

49
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,341
{\an8}Don't worry, I got a plan.

50
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,669
{\an8}OK, Ned, the first thing we have to do

51
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:14,045
{\an8}(whispering) is to make sure
that no one knows that you're dead.

52
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:18,974
{\an8}If anyone asks you,
just say that you're not dead.

53
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,346
Hey, Maude!

54
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:24,522
Look who's helping me clean the chimney.

55
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:27,979
Neddy?

56
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:28,984
Where have you been?

57
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,895
Hi, Maude... Diddily.

58
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,695
I've been having fun with my pal Homer.

59
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,494
Diddily.

60
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,529
Oh, I'm so relieved.

61
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:42,497
Whenever you go on one
of your late-night fog walks,

62
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,999
I get so worried.

63
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,540
Relax. I'm fine.

64
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:50,844
But when I do die,
I don't want any autopsies.

65
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,630
Well, come on down, you goofy roofy.

66
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,255
-Wow, it sure is slippery up here.
-(bell dings)

67
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,512
My pies are done.

68
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:58,931
(thuds)

69
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,306
Aw, she missed it.

70
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,477
Hey, Maude, I'm home!

71
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,186
Uh-oh, I think I'm having a heart attack!

72
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,686
(thuds)

73
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,609
(Maude screams)

74
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,531
And that's the end of that chapter.

75
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,493
(bell ringing)

76
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,539
Aw. (sobbing)

77
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,456
(whispering) Try not to look too sad.

78
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,788
It'll seem suspicious.

79
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:34,553
And now Ned's best friend
will say a few words.

80
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,971
Homer.

81
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,049
(clears throat)

82
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,053
When I think about Ned,

83
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,434
I can't help but remember

84
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,720
the look on his face

85
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,223
when Marge drove over...

86
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,505
Homer shut up, shut up, shut up.

87
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,928
Oh, wait.

88
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,730
What I'd like to say is

89
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,848
we're still looking for the real killers.

90
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,478
Anyway, in conclusion,

91
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,114
a man cannot be forced
to testify against his wife.

92
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,494
MARGE: Stop winking.

93
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,530
{\an8}We'll miss you, buddy.

94
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,950
Hey, we just got away with murder.

95
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,703
And it was so easy.

96
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,076
No, I've never liked the little wiener

97
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,373
Milhouse.

98
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,286
(tires screeching)

99
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,924
MARGE: No more murders.

100
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,586
But you got to kill--

101
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,669
No!

102
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,089
(gasps)

103
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,718
Someone saw us.

104
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,550
ALL: But who?

105
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,225
Homer, stop that.

106
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,977
(thunder rumbling)

107
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,563
(phone ringing)

108
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,528
Who could be calling at this hour?

109
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,112
(stammering)

110
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,454
Y'ello?

111
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,781
(creepy voice) <i>I know you're alone.</i>

112
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,834
{\an8}Oh... who is this?

113
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,408
<i>Is this Maude Flanders?</i>

114
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,454
No, it's... Homer.

115
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,290
(normal voice<i>) Oh, hey, Homer, it's Moe.</i>

116
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,923
<i>I must've dialed the wrong number.</i>

117
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,500
(thunder rumbling loudly)

118
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,127
(all screaming)

119
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,181
HOMER: Get in the car.

120
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,969
(starting engine)

121
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,347
(all screaming)

122
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,404
Dear God, it's Homer.

123
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,400
If you really love me,

124
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,901
you'll save my life now.

125
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,483
HOMER: D'oh.

126
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,608
(engine sputtering)

127
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,451
He's getting closer!

128
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,162
(all gasp)

129
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,452
(thunder rumbling)

130
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,826
OK, Marge, you hide
in the abandoned amusement park.

131
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,537
Lisa, the Pet Cemetery.

132
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,036
Bart, spooky roller disco.

133
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,714
And I'll go skinny-dipping in that lake

134
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,376
where the sexy teens were killed
a hundred years ago tonight.

135
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,014
Now, Flanders, I want you to...

136
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,724
(screaming)

137
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,854
It's impossible. I killed you.

138
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,981
(chuckles) You can't kill
the undead, silly.

139
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,140

140
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,057
He's undead, all right.

141
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,145
Are you a zombie?

142
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,726
Oh, I wish.

143
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,784
You see, that night
when you hit me with your car...

144
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,197
I'm making record time on this fog walk.

145
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,859

146
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,451
Better pick up the pace.

Hey, you know,
we got feelings, too, chief.

174

Just dump your candy
on the X- ray belt, Ralphie.

Ooh, white chocolate.

00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,968
He would on Halloween.

184
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,432
(grunting)

185
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,349
Get in there, you stupid pillowcase.

186
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,055
Stop it. You'll jam the machine.

187
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,475
(rumbling)

188
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,113
Uh-oh. Radiation! Duck and cover!

189
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,191
(screaming)

190
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,145
Cool!

191
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,436
Bart!

192
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,068
Oh, my god! Lisa!

193
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,740
She's been crushed

194
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,250
and so have the hopes
of our mathletics team.

195
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,000
Hold the funeral, poindexter.

196
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,169
"Poindexter?"

197
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,790
(grunting)

198
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,417
Whoa, Lise, those X-rays

199
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,264
must have given you super strength!

200
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,129
{\an8}I wonder if I got any powers.

201
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:30,972
{\an8}Nope, looks normal.

202
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,764
{\an8}Wait a minute.

203
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:33,885
{\an8}I can stretch.

204
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,425
{\an8}Look at me! Ow!

205
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,767
{\an8}Hot-hot-hot!

206
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,599
I must only use this power to annoy.

207
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,726
(knocking at door)

208
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,321
Now, who could that be at this hour?

209
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,947
Yes? Yes? Up? Down? Side to side?

210
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,030
What's your point?

211
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,124
Ow!

212
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,329

213
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,368
I Gotcha.

214
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,661
Bart, with these powers,

215
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,374

216
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,409

227
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,952
But I'm sure that once girls
get to know the real you

228
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,409
you'll get plenty of dates.

229
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,659
Next question.

230
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,030
Yes, over here.

231
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,157
(clearing throat)

232
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,163
In episode BF12,

233
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,955
you were battling Barbarians

234
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,118
while riding a winged appaloosa

235
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,747
yet in the very next scene, my dear,

236
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,424
you're clearly atop a winged Arabian.

237
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,633
Please to explain it.

238
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,303
Ah. Yeah. Well,

239
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,341
whenever you notice something like that,

240
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,255
a wizard did it.

241
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,552
I see. All right. Yes.

242
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,005
But in episode AG4...

243
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,965
{\an8}-Wizard.
-Ah. For glayvin out loud.

244
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,805
(glass shattering)

245
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,846
Behold! I am the Collector

246
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,765
and I'm here to add you to my collection.

247
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,108

248
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,445
(grunting)

249
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:16,028
Must remove... my breastplate!

250
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,115
(groaning)

251
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,329
Maybe later.

252
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,583
Care for a Rolo, sweet Xena?

253
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,714
All right, Collector,
stick this in your tweezers.

254
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,881
I'm not Xena!

255
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,339
I'm an actress, you lunatic!

256
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,339
Oh, please.

257
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,760
I'm not insane.

258
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,132
I simply wish to take you back to my lair

259
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,295
and make you my bride.

260
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,973
Oh, dear God!

261
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,639
Clobber Girl?

262
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,854
(grunting)

263
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:44,891
Thank you.

264
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,310
Help!

265
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,940
It's Xena!

266
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,527
She's been kidnapped.

267
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,570
-(gasps)
-Come on.

268
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,663
Remember, you're vulnerable to kryptonite.

269
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,791
Geez, Marge, tell the neighborhood!

270
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,464
Fear not, my syndicated sweetie.

271
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,382
You'll be preserved in this mylar pouch

272
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:14,221
forever remaining in...
near-mint condition

273
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,128
between Dr. Who and,
of course, Yasmine Bleeth.

274
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,298
I don't think so.

275
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,636
(grunting)

276
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,601
I don't think so either.

277
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,101
{\an8}(mocking in sing-song voice)

278
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,845
Your collecting days are over, Collector.

279
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,818
Stop right there!

280
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,778
I have here the only
working phaser ever built.

281
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,448
It was fired only once
to keep William Shatner

282
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,779
from making another album.

283
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,368
Stretch dude-- Help!

284
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,449
Just a sec.

285
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,788

286
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,288
(phaser humming)

287
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,125
-Whoa!
-Hey, phaser, phaser, phaser. Zing!

288
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,050
(phaser clicking)

289
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,512
-(groans)
-Ne ne!

290
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,603
Good night, "Retch" Dude
and "Slobber" Girl.

291
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,560
Sweet screams.

292
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,604

(grunting and groaning)

294
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,355
Soon, those bratty buttinskies

295
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,859
will be encased in lucite

296
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,400
for all eternity.

297
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,153
While we're waiting, here's some names

298
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,855
you may call me on our wedding night.

299
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:18,945
(clears throat)

300
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,569
"Obi-Wan," "Iron Man,"

301
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,196
"Mr. Mxyzptlk"

302
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,083
and, of course, "Big Papa Smurf."

303
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,620
What do you need me for?

304
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,083
You could have your choice of
any of the women in these bags.

305
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,714
You would think so, but no.

306
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,166
Really?

307
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,802
Well, I mean, maybe
we are meant for each other.

308
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,760
Growing up, I was always tall for my age

309
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,010
and the other kids made fun of me.

310
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,631
I... I always hoped

311
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,138
for another misunderstood soul

312
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,849
to share my pain and...

313
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,139
you could be that soul, Collector.

314
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,313
Oh...

315
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,891
Come here, you.

316
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,016
Xena needs xex.

317

Oh!

322
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,241
You tricked me

323
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,994
with a ruse so hackneyed

324
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,745
-it would make Stan Lee blush.
-Shut up.

Ow, that hurts!

329
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,300
Bart, just let me drop and save yourself.

330
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,352
What do you think I've been trying to do?

331
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,011
Aha!

332
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,017
Not even Xena is a match

You removed it
from its original packaging.

338
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,570
(gasping) No!

339
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,275
It's no longer a collectible.

00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,995

Wait a minute.

353
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:12,984
Xena can't fly.

354

00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,679
Blimp wrecks, teenagers...

367
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,223
Then again, we had two TV shows
with Andy Griffith.

368
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,928
And 11 with Robert Urich.

369
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,648
♪ Super freak Super freak ♪

370
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,150
♪ <i>I'm super freakin' ♪</i>

371
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,361
<i>♪ Yow ♪</i>

372
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,566
Oh, man, what'd I do now?

373
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,397
Wonderful. Now, that song is dedicated

374
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,486
to all you super geeks

375
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,821
who rocked around the clock

376
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,406
to exterminate America's Y2K bugs.
Slammin'!

377
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:14,542
Hey, Homer, weren't you the plant's
Y2K compliance officer?

378
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,872
Absolutely.

379
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,746
Must have been hard debugging
all those computers, huh, Homer?

380
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,884
{\an8}Doing what now?

381
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,800
{\an8}You did fix them, right, Dad?

382
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,469
Because even a single
faulty unit could corrupt

383
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,798
every other computer in the world.

384
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,644
That can't be true, Honey.

385
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,059
If it were, I'd be terrified.

386
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,597
{\an8}Eight, seven, six...

387
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,812
{\an8}We want to thank Dixie brand mayonnaise.

388
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,903
{\an8}Whoo lawdy, what a mayonnaise.

389
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,148
{\an8}Three, two...

390
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,774
{\an8}(buzzer)

391
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,816
That's Homer Simpsons's computer.

392
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,534
Oh, God. It's spreading!

393
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,914
Happy New... Wha...?

394
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,830
Oh, no. It's happening.

395
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,659
(screaming)

396
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:00,877
Uh-oh.

397
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,797
(screaming)

398
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,380
("Auld Lang Syne" playing)

399
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,814
Ha! Wha...?

400
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:16,771
(muffled) Ha.

401
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,984
(grunts)

402
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,239
Who's going to clean up all those jets?

403
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,704
(crashing continues)

404
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,411
There goes the clothesline.

405
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,659
Well, those ivory tower
eggheads have screwed us again.

406
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,702
(chuckles)

407
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,200
Let's just have some milk and go to bed.

408
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,207
(yells)

409
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,958
Hey, this milk's broken!

410
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,540
{\an8}It's got a computer chip in it.

411
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,875
Everything does.

412
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,040
-(alarm ringing)
-(both gasp)

413
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,131
-(doors slamming)
-(motors whirring)

414
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,344
D'oh! Ow!

415
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,514
(muttering)

416
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,257
(yowling)

417
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,295
{\an8}(groaning in fear)

418
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,218
(yelling)

419
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:00,017
Judgment Day is upon us.

420
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,436
I warned you the Lord wouldn't stand

421
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,521
for your minidresses and Beatle boots...

422
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,357
I resisted these for 35 years.

423
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,704
Why did I wear them today?

424
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,948
But it's not too late
to repent your sins

425
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,412
and be embraced by the almighty!

426
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,292
Hey, everybody, they're looting the mall.

427
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,829
Hurry! I got nine shoe buffers.

428
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,867
(all cheering)

429
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,541
I'm caught on something.

430
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,207
I don't want you looting.

431
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,336
But I was going to loot you a present.

432
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,473
Oh, all right.

433
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,759
Yay!

434
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,392
(sirens blaring)

435
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,599
(screaming and yelling)

436
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,137
Oh, thank you, Homey.

437
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,805
A lady Remington.

438
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,271
(whirring)

439
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,273
(yells)

440
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,111
{\an8}(yelling)

441
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:58,988
{\an8}Well, look at the wonders
of the Computer Age now.

442
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,998
Wonders, Lisa, or blunders?

443
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,961
{\an8}I think that was implied by what I said.

444
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,671
Implied, Lisa, or implode?

445
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,835
Mom, make him stop.

446
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,962
(man groaning)

447
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,722
Oh, no, Krusty.

448
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,300
{\an8}(groaning continues)

449
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,434
My pacemaker, it's stuck on hummingbird!

450
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,683
Nectar, nectar!

451
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,604
I need to drink my weight in nectar.

452
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,602
{\an8}(loud thud)

453
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,853
Krusty!

454
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:25,903
Hey, a note.

455
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,275
"You have been selected
for Operation Exodus."

456
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,485
They're evacuating the Earth.

457
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,490
Oh, we're saved!

458
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:39,372
(sobbing) Thank you, sweet clown.

459
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,331
In death, you saved us all.

460
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,119
KRUSTY: (weakly) I'm not dead.

461
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,461
I can still hear his voice on the wind.

462
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,593
BART: There it is.

463
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,420
Just like the dead clown promised.

464
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,795
(elevator bell dings)

465
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,009
BART: Wow. There's Bill Gates,

466
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,266
Stephen Hawking, Paul McCartney,

467
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,518
Michael Jordan, Michelle Kwan...

468
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,560
{\an8}They must be starting
a new civilization on Mars

469
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,234
{\an8}with our best and brightest.

470
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,562
That's us!

471
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,146
-Name, please.
-Certainly.

472
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:15,453
I am... the, uh, piano genius
from the movie <i>Shine.</i>

473
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,113
Uh-huh. And your name is?

474
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,703
Uh... Shiny McShine?

475
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,244
Actually, he's Homer Simpson.

476
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,697
That's Bart. I'm Lisa.

477
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,787
Lisa Simpson?

478
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,294
Oh, you're the ship's proofreader.

479
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,373
Welcome aboard.

480
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,997
Now, before you enter you're going

481
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,134
to have to make a very difficult choice.

482
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,588
You're only allowed
to take one parent with you.

483
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,512
Mom.

484
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,512
Love you lots.

485
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,973
Good-bye, Lisa.

486
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,512
Remember me as I am--

487
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,894
Filled with murderous rage.

488
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,308
Well, son, I guess this is the end.

489
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,435
{\an8}But we've both had long, full lives.

490
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,780
{\an8}Oh, right.

491
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,700
{\an8}Hey, look, another spaceship.

492
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,198
And there's nobody guarding it.

493
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,620
Let's go.

494
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,502
I can't believe I destroyed the Earth.

495
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,040
Are you still talking about the Earth?

496
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,584
Right, got to let it go.

497
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,463
{\an8}All that counts is we're alive

498
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,714
{\an8}and rubbing elbows with the greats.

499
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,376
{\an8}(gasps) Ooh.

500
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,715
{\an8}There's Ross Perot.

501
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,091
Dr. Laura.

502
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,386
Spike Lee.

503
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,469
Wait a minute.
They're not so great.

504
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,814
OK, but there's

505
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,019
Dan Quayle and Courtney Love,

506
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,731
Tanya Harding,

507
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,189
Al Sharpton?

508
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,189
(screams) Tom Arnold!

509
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,651
What the hell's going on?

510
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,440
Wait. Only that ship is going to Mars.

511
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,235
Ours is headed for the sun.

512
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,739
Yeah, ain't that a kick in the teeth?

513
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,410
I mean, my shows weren't great but I never

514
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,199
tied people up and forced them to watch,

515
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,702
and I could've, 'cause I'm a big guy

516
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,794
and I'm good with knots.

517
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,538
So, we're all going to die?

518
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,500
Afraid so, but, hey,
the grub's pretty good, huh?

519
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,960
(laughs)

520
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,875
The Sun?

521
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,590
That's the hottest place on Earth.

522
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,380
Gonna work on my tannage, buddy.

523
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,625
Pauly Shore? Wow!

524
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,927
Hey, we should do a show together, man.

525
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,640
That's a sure cure for the blues.

526
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,060
(blowing noisemaker)

527
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,718
Hey, turn those frowns around!

528
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,848
{\an8}Oh, no, Rosie O'Donnell!

529
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,396
Come on, everybody, sing along.

Don't worry, Dad.
We'll be dead in five minutes.

538
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,115
Not fast enough.

539
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,093
(singing continues)
