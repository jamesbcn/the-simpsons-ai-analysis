Mmm, so slivered.

145
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:31,105
Mmm.

146
00:08:34,076 --> 00:08:38,046

wished for creeping me out?

147
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,649
I don't know. 'Cause you're

150
00:08:44,653 --> 00:08:46,888
Dad, what's that
on your lap?

151
00:08:46,922 --> 00:08:48,056
A napkin.

153
00:08:51,594 --> 00:08:55,563

(grunting, panting)

155
00:09:04,306 --> 00:09:06,875
Can I just get a glass of water?

156
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:09,377
Water? That stuff killed
my grandmother.

157
00:09:09,411 --> 00:09:12,080
So sad.

158
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:21,256
I've been having snuggle dreams.

159
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,688
Marge, I changed in Boise.

160
00:09:24,727 --> 00:09:28,663
I'm not sure a man who eats right 
and doesn't drink can be good in bed.

161
00:09:28,697 --> 00:09:31,099
- Well, what made you...?
- You're so beautiful

162
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:34,269
when I cut you off in
the middle of a question.

163

Oh. Oh, my.

165
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:41,843
What's that thing
you're doing?

166
00:09:41,877 --> 00:09:44,279
HOMER (sultrily):
Moving my body.

167
00:09:44,313 --> 00:09:46,781
MARGE (chuckling):
Oh.

168
00:09:46,815 --> 00:09:50,351
(humming happily)

169
00:09:50,386 --> 00:09:54,422
Don't you think it's weird that Dad
stopped eating pork <i>and</i> drinking beer?

170
00:09:54,456 --> 00:09:57,458
Who cares what happened? Daddy's back.

171

Something happened to Dad
on that trip.

174
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:17,812
This is worse than when he went to New Orleans
and came back with a Southern accent.

175
00:10:17,846 --> 00:10:20,315
(deep Southern accent):
Uh, how y'all doin'?

176
00:10:20,349 --> 00:10:22,517
(crunch)

177
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,739
(dog barking in distance)

178
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:29,763
Chief Wiggum, how come every time there's a
terrorist chatter in this town, you come to me?

179
00:10:29,781 --> 00:10:32,827
Lay off, Apu. When I look at
people, I don't see colors.

180
00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:34,876
I just see crackpot religions.

181
00:10:34,915 --> 00:10:38,166
Chief, is there really a terrorist threat
to Springfield?

182
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,569
Yeah. I got
a very important phone call.

183
00:10:41,603 --> 00:10:43,371
(phone rings)
Yello?

184
00:10:43,405 --> 00:10:45,206
MAN:
Is this line secure?

185
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,875
Uh, it's a little jiggly
but it'll hold.

186
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,713
We got intel... uh, that's short
for a word I don't know...

187
00:10:51,747 --> 00:10:53,881
Intelligence?
I don't believe so, no.

188
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:57,986
Anyway, this intel says that
someone in town has been turned

189
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,588
and they're working for terrorists.
(gasps)

190
00:11:00,622 --> 00:11:03,491
Now, I got to go check
my other suspects.

191
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:05,326
Uh-huh.

192
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:07,462
But I may be back.

193
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:13,201
Huh?

194
00:11:13,235 --> 00:11:16,204
(gasps)
Dad's kneeling on a prayer mat.

195
00:11:16,238 --> 00:11:18,873
He doesn't believe in kneeling.

196
00:11:18,907 --> 00:11:22,543
(chanting indistinctly)

197
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:25,613
Huh? It looks like he's praying.

198
00:11:26,648 --> 00:11:29,217
To the east. The Middle East.

199
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:30,885
Mecca.

200
00:11:37,893 --> 00:11:39,994
(quietly): He's targeting
the nuclear plant.

201
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,768
Meow?

202
00:11:46,802 --> 00:11:49,037
If you are a cat, prove it.

203
00:11:49,071 --> 00:11:52,040
Do you hate Mondays,
like Garfield? (screeches)

204
00:11:52,074 --> 00:11:54,942
And do you love lasagna,
like me?

205
00:11:54,977 --> 00:11:56,377
Meow.

206
00:11:56,412 --> 00:11:58,446
Okay then.

207
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,814
(humming happily)

208
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:07,221
Mom, I have to tell you something
about Dad, something big!

209
00:12:07,256 --> 00:12:10,591
I know. He's changed.

210
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:11,659
Exactly.

211
00:12:11,693 --> 00:12:12,894
For the better.

212
00:12:12,928 --> 00:12:14,839
- And men don't change that way. 
- But-but...

213
00:12:14,863 --> 00:12:16,762
 Do you know what
we're doing on Sunday?

214
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,433
Brunch with the Hibberts.
Then the tile store.

215
00:12:19,501 --> 00:12:23,871
He's like a husband
in a widow's memory... perfect.

216
00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:26,507
(grunting)

217
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:28,509
Perfect.

218
00:12:28,544 --> 00:12:30,778
Perfect.

219
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:38,686
(beeping)

220
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,022
(phone rings)
FBI.

221
00:12:41,056 --> 00:12:43,257
I think someone I love
is a terrorist.

222
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:44,859
Does that make me crazy?

223
00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:46,861
No, no. Not at all.

224
00:12:46,895 --> 00:12:49,864
It took me two hours to get
home. Traffic was <i>crazy.</i>

225
00:12:49,898 --> 00:12:51,699
Are you people
talking about me?

226
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:53,868
No. We're not even
here right now.

227
00:13:04,913 --> 00:13:06,881
742 Evergreen Terrace.
I'll be right there.

228
00:13:06,915 --> 00:13:08,816
And don't believe what
you've heard about me.

229
00:13:08,851 --> 00:13:11,853
I haven't heard anything
about you except from you.

230
00:13:13,555 --> 00:13:16,724
Hanging up
the receiver, eh?

231
00:13:16,758 --> 00:13:18,626
(gasps)
How much did you hear?

232
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,961
How much did you say?

233
00:13:19,995 --> 00:13:21,028
Nothing, really.

234
00:13:21,063 --> 00:13:23,197
So I heard half of nothing.

235
00:13:23,232 --> 00:13:26,234
Dad, you're scary
when you're calm and focused.

236
00:13:26,268 --> 00:13:28,970
Lisa, I'll miss you
when this is all over.

237
00:13:29,004 --> 00:13:30,338
When what's all over?

238
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:32,340
This conversation.
(chuckles nervously)

239
00:13:32,374 --> 00:13:34,542
See you on the other side.

240
00:13:34,576 --> 00:13:35,877
What other side?

241
00:13:35,911 --> 00:13:37,812
Of the house.
Where the fireplace is.

242
00:13:37,846 --> 00:13:39,547
We're toasting marshmallows.

243
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:41,315
Marsh...

244
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,551
mallows.

245
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:56,013
I'm Bart Simpson.
Who the hell are you?

246
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:57,848
Agent Crawford, FBI.

247
00:13:57,882 --> 00:14:00,083
You guys know I don't talk
to field agents.

248
00:14:00,118 --> 00:14:01,919
Get your boss on the phone.

249
00:14:01,953 --> 00:14:04,554
I'm not here for you.
I'm here for your dad.

250
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:06,556
What do you want
with his dad?

251
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,191
Go back to
sleep, Milhouse.

252
00:14:08,226 --> 00:14:09,593
How do you know my name?

253
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:12,129
I didn't. But I do now.

254
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:15,299
- Don't talk.
- Okay.

255
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,392
I want you to know I'm the best there
is at finding out what you're up to.

256
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:20,026
- Ooh. 
- I can torture you.

257
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:23,373
I can give you incredible sex. Or you
can just tell me what I want to know.

258
00:14:23,408 --> 00:14:25,409
- What was the first one again? 
- I see.

259
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,210
- You're stupid.
- Hey.

260
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:29,212
I'm the one in bed
with two beautiful women.

261
00:14:29,247 --> 00:14:30,213
(gasps)

262
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:33,150
You think
I'm beautiful? Oh!

263
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:35,118
In a breaking-and-entering
kind of way.

264
00:14:35,153 --> 00:14:37,120
Well, give me something,
or I'm not leaving.

265
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:38,889
(snoring)

266
00:14:38,923 --> 00:14:42,326
Let's just say I've got
to get to work on time.

267
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,729
And if you knew me, you'd know
just how odd that sounds.

268
00:14:45,763 --> 00:14:49,166
- Who are you talking to? 
- No one.

269
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,302
You're in too deep, Annie.
Get out.

270
00:14:52,337 --> 00:14:54,073
Are you real, or my imagination?

271
00:14:54,112 --> 00:14:56,480
Either way,
my advice is sound.

272
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:00,944
I love my job.

00:16:10,548 --> 00:16:12,916
but it's not worth
blowing up everyone you love.

296
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,418
I'm not blowing up the plant.

297
00:16:14,452 --> 00:16:15,819

Oh.

298
00:16:15,853 --> 00:16:19,723
Just harmlessly stopping it from
doing more damage to Mother Earth.

299
00:16:19,757 --> 00:16:23,093
Is that something your terrorist
masters told you to tell me?

00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:24,761

Yes.

and it's only the end

LISA:
<i>But I saw you praying to Mecca.</i>

317
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,785
Lisa, I've never prayed
to a city in my life,

318
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:24,721
and if I did, it would be
Hershey, Pennsylvania.

319
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:27,824
I was kneeling on the
affirmation rug they gave me.

320
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:30,594
See?

321
00:17:30,628 --> 00:17:33,597
(rhythmically): Ow, this rug is hard on my knees.
Ow, this rug is hard on my knees.

322
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:34,965
Ow, this rug is hard
on my knees.

323
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:37,434
But wait, wait, wait.
What is this?

324
00:17:37,468 --> 00:17:39,736
Lisa, the most horrible truth
of all is,

325
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,440
the plant where I work poisons
our water and our air.

326
00:17:43,474 --> 00:17:45,742
I've told you that
a million times.

327
00:17:45,776 --> 00:17:49,446
Aw, sweetie, you told me a
thousand things a million times.

328
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,182
Even with a brain
the size of a dinosaur's,

329
00:17:52,216 --> 00:17:53,950
I couldn't take that in.

330
00:17:53,985 --> 00:17:58,822
Anyhoo, this canister is full of spoiled
milk and utility-grade chicken,

331
00:17:58,856 --> 00:18:01,458
both sold to me by Apu
this morning.

332
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:04,594
When I release it into the AC system,

333
00:18:04,629 --> 00:18:06,930
it'll stink up
the plant forever.

334
00:18:06,964 --> 00:18:10,100
No one can use it,
but no one gets hurt.

335
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:12,836
Just like
when I smell up the toilet.

336
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,837
(knocking)
(gasps) Huh?

337
00:18:13,871 --> 00:18:15,839

338
00:18:15,873 --> 00:18:16,840
(door opens)

339
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:17,841
There he is.

340
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,709
Use your fattest handcuffs.

341
00:18:19,744 --> 00:18:21,511
Hey. Uh, it's not
what you think, Lou.

342
00:18:21,546 --> 00:18:22,646
Lou, Lou, Lou.

343
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,647

Lou-Lou-Lou-Lou-Lou...!

344
00:18:23,681 --> 00:18:25,015
(groans)

345
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:29,719
I can complete my dad's mission
just like George W. Bush.

346
00:18:29,754 --> 00:18:32,522
I can't shoot a little girl.

347
00:18:32,557 --> 00:18:34,124
(gunshot)
Ah, damn it!

348
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:39,262
There's some things they just don't teach
you in the police academy... movies.

349
00:18:40,331 --> 00:18:42,632
(distorted grunting)

350
00:18:46,737 --> 00:18:47,704
(electronic trilling)

351
00:18:47,738 --> 00:18:49,172
(rhythmic chugging)

352
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,509
We did it, Dad. We did it.

353
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,877
We sure did.

354
00:18:53,911 --> 00:18:54,878
(grunts)

355
00:18:54,912 --> 00:18:57,180
You weren't shot.

356
00:18:57,215 --> 00:18:59,916
No, I was just up late
watching a movie.

357
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:02,719
Something with
William Holden and...

358
00:19:02,753 --> 00:19:04,054
(snoring)

359
00:19:08,926 --> 00:19:10,894
Your plan failed.

360
00:19:10,928 --> 00:19:13,663
Thank God this plant has never had
a functioning air conditioner.

361
00:19:13,698 --> 00:19:17,167
Wait a minute, Burns. You don't have a
functioning AC system at a nuclear plant?

362
00:19:17,201 --> 00:19:20,203
- That's against the law. 
- That's impossible.

363
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:22,005
Smithers, didn't we move
this plant to China?

364
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:24,908
Sir, that's two years from now, and
you're not supposed to tell anyone.

365
00:19:24,942 --> 00:19:25,976
Oopsie.

366
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:30,113
There isn't a prison made
that can hold me.

367
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:32,282
Prisons are still made
of mud and wattles, right?

368
00:19:32,316 --> 00:19:35,919
No. Concrete.
(gasps loudly)

369
00:19:35,953 --> 00:19:38,255
You know, Dad, just because
your mission's complete,

370
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:44,581
it doesn't mean you have to go back
to pork eating and beer... drinking.

371
00:19:44,596 --> 00:19:48,265
A beer from the sky! It's a sign!

372
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:49,699
(laughing)

373
00:19:51,068 --> 00:19:54,671
Yeah, this equipment will pay for
itself in one night of binging.

374
00:19:57,808 --> 00:20:01,611
I wish a mission could bring me
closer to someone, but it can't.

375
00:20:01,646 --> 00:20:04,748
Okay, it's time for me
to walk alone into the sunset.

376
00:20:05,983 --> 00:20:07,384
(gulps loudly)

377
00:20:07,418 --> 00:20:08,985
That's better.

378
00:20:14,158 --> 00:20:16,593
(groans)

379
00:20:30,232 --> 00:20:33,234
Amazingly, the hamster's
older than I am.
