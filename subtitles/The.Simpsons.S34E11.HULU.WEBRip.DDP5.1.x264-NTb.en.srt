00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,790
And I'm gonna make sure
that you learn from the best.

180
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,600
Welcome to Top Goon.

It's beautiful.

182
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,365
I'm gonna learn so hard, Moe.

183
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:52,209
- I won't let you down.
- I know you won't, kid.

184
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:56,617
- What was that?
- Oh, I just tousled your hair.

185
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,090
Ain't nobody
ever done that before?

186
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:00,331
Uh...

Yeah, my arm's getting
a little tired, here.

189

- (sighing): All right.

Welcome to Top Goon.

191
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,990
I'd like to introduce you
to your faculty,

00:08:14,989 --> 00:08:17,559
the most feared men

Dave "The Hammer" Schultz.

00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,665
That's just a nickname.

195
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:23,708
My given name is
David "The Hammer" Schultz.

Stu "The Grim Reaper" Grimson.

197

As a goon, you have
one job on the ice:

00:08:43,146 --> 00:08:45,376
protect your team's best scorer.

207
00:08:45,383 --> 00:08:48,193
We call that person
your "primary."

208
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:51,729
This is the most important
person in your life.

209
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,100
Who's the best scorer
on your team, Muntz?

210
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:57,441
- Bart Simpson.
- Then Bart Simpson
is your primary.

211
00:08:57,441 --> 00:08:59,341
Don't forget it.

212
00:08:59,344 --> 00:09:02,484
- Who do we protect?
- ALL: Our primary.

213
00:09:02,484 --> 00:09:04,664
And what do we do
for our primary?

214
00:09:04,656 --> 00:09:06,156
ALL:
Protect them.

215
00:09:06,158 --> 00:09:07,858
And who do we protect?

216
00:09:09,164 --> 00:09:10,504

Do you have any smaller letters?

353
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:19,468
I'm no goon.
I'm just a fist.

354
00:15:21,743 --> 00:15:24,383
And this last stop in hell

355
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,151
is where I belong.

356
00:15:26,953 --> 00:15:28,563
(inhales, exhales)

357
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:33,531
♪

358
00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:36,369
Afternoon there, ma'am.

359
00:15:36,371 --> 00:15:37,811
Uh, I'm Moe Szysl...

360
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:39,208
Yeah, can you hurry it up?

361
00:15:39,211 --> 00:15:42,381
I got to eat this when
it's fresh off the zapper.

362
00:15:42,383 --> 00:15:43,493
It's about your kid.

363
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:45,856
I was his hockey coach
and I yelled some stuff

364
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:47,958
that might have kicked
his heart in the plums.

365
00:15:47,962 --> 00:15:50,072
Oh, so you're
Coach Sizzle-slacks,

366
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:52,366
the guy he calls his primary.

367
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,140
What? Nelson thinks
I'm his primary?

368
00:15:55,143 --> 00:15:57,383
- You sure about this?
- Yup.

369
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,720
He yelled the whole story
at the window dog.

370
00:16:00,721 --> 00:16:02,391
(growling)

371
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,830
Nelson wasn't being a psycho
towards Bart.

372
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:07,169
He was being a goon for me.

373
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,497
Do you know where he went?

374
00:16:08,503 --> 00:16:10,973
He said something about
walking the streets.

375
00:16:10,974 --> 00:16:13,584
Coming to a fateful decision
or whatnot.

376
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,120
Eh. Kid stuff.

377
00:16:15,116 --> 00:16:17,486
I got to find him
before he does something crazy.

378
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:20,959
Nelson Muntz.

379
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:23,371
Your reputation precedes you.

380
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:26,065
I hear you're a dingus
to be respected.

381
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:28,111
I'm just a fist with no code.

382
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:30,878
Figure I'll be working
for you sooner or later,

383
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:33,451
so why not get it over with?

384
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:39,501
I have a gift for smelling out
good henchmen.

385
00:16:39,497 --> 00:16:40,567
(sniffing)

386
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,267
I'm getting hints
of barely-suppressed rage

387
00:16:43,272 --> 00:16:45,482
with top notes
of "nothing matters" and...

388
00:16:45,476 --> 00:16:46,746
(sniffing)

389
00:16:46,746 --> 00:16:50,286
...a deep finish of abandonment
by a male role model.

390
00:16:50,286 --> 00:16:53,026
Smell all you want.
It won't fix anything.

391
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:54,225
Just tell me who to hurt.

392
00:16:54,227 --> 00:16:56,327
Want me to get him a lead pipe?

393
00:16:56,331 --> 00:17:00,541
Let's start him out easy. PVC.

394
00:17:06,084 --> 00:17:08,564
How you doing, son?
Can you move?

395
00:17:08,557 --> 00:17:10,527
A little, but it hurts.

396
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:11,957
I meant can you
move off the couch.

397
00:17:11,963 --> 00:17:15,543
I'm about to enjoy my first
hockey-free weekend in months.

398
00:17:15,537 --> 00:17:17,637
Ooh, hockey!

399
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:19,781
(grunting)

400
00:17:20,714 --> 00:17:23,854
Homer, get up.
You and Bart are gonna be late.

401
00:17:23,853 --> 00:17:26,193
What? He's useless.
Doc said so.

402
00:17:26,191 --> 00:17:29,031
He can't play any sport
that I have to drive him to.

403
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,940
He has physical therapy,
and the only place

404
00:17:31,936 --> 00:17:35,306
that takes our insurance
is three hours away.

405
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:38,279
If they ask, Bart is a veteran.

406
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:39,652
Oh...

407
00:17:42,423 --> 00:17:44,733
Mr. Mayor, I believe
you know the founder

408
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:48,799
of this vaguely-purposed
yet tax-exempt charity,

409
00:17:48,803 --> 00:17:50,713
my <i>goomar.</i>

410
00:17:50,707 --> 00:17:54,077
Mistresses are the lifeblood
of our community.

411
00:17:58,255 --> 00:18:00,625
Private event.
No pictures.

412
00:18:01,428 --> 00:18:04,328
Well done, Nelly No-Sleeves.

413
00:18:05,938 --> 00:18:07,608
If you'll excuse me,

414
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:10,748
my men and I have some
perfectly innocent business

415
00:18:10,747 --> 00:18:14,047
to attend to in the back room.

416
00:18:14,054 --> 00:18:16,434
God bless back rooms.

417
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:18,825
You know why you're here.

418
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,740
You borrow money from me,
I expect to be repaid.

419
00:18:22,738 --> 00:18:25,678
Time to make your bones.

420
00:18:25,677 --> 00:18:27,547
NELSON:
Lead.

421
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,087
This is all I am.

422
00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:32,658
MOE:
Stop!

423
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,730
Nelson, listen to me
before you done did something

424
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:37,773
you can't done undid.

425
00:18:37,768 --> 00:18:40,108
Whoever's under that hood
don't deserve this.

426
00:18:40,106 --> 00:18:42,676
- They're a human being.
- Moe!

427
00:18:42,678 --> 00:18:45,748
Aw, thank you, old buddy.
(weak chuckle)

428
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,721
Oh, not youse!

429
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:49,121
You got to help me out.

430
00:18:49,124 --> 00:18:51,164
I only borrowed money
from the mafia

431
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:53,471
to buy fake birth certificates
for teenagers

432
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,665
so they could play
ten-and-under hockey.

433
00:18:55,671 --> 00:18:58,911
No one deserves a Kansas City
knee job more than this guy,

434
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,310
but that don't matter none.

435
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:03,393
You swing that pipe,
that's your soul on the line.

436
00:19:03,385 --> 00:19:05,385
You're wasting your time,
"Coach."

437
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:08,159
You said it yourself:
I'm just a fist.

438
00:19:08,162 --> 00:19:10,172
I know, and that's how
I saw youse at first.

439
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,536
As a weapon.

440
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:12,706
I was using you,

441
00:19:12,705 --> 00:19:15,505
because I was obsessed
with beating King Toot here.

442
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,350
I knew it.
I'm in your head, bro.

443
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:21,619
Feed him his own mustache!
No, wait. Don't, don't.

444
00:19:21,622 --> 00:19:23,532
Listen to me.
You're a great kid.

445
00:19:23,526 --> 00:19:27,196
You're determined, selfless,
a real teammate...

446
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,170
And you did for me
what I failed to do for you.

447
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:32,912
You had my back, scuzz to scuzz.

448
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,050
Aw. (chuckles)

449
00:19:37,053 --> 00:19:38,163
I don't know.

450
00:19:38,155 --> 00:19:41,285
Sometimes, boss, I think
you only see me as a knife.

451
00:19:41,294 --> 00:19:42,564
Did you know I got dreams?

452
00:19:42,564 --> 00:19:44,944
I want to open a gourmet
mac and cheese place

453
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:46,435
called Louie's Gooey.

454
00:19:46,438 --> 00:19:48,778
And I'm learning Swedish
on a phone app.

455
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:50,747
But I'm just a gun to you.

456
00:19:50,747 --> 00:19:53,947
Gentlemen, I don't
see you as weapons.

457
00:19:55,857 --> 00:19:57,757
(crying)

458
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:01,573
Freaking millennials.

459
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:05,179
Hockey's over, but maybe
we could still do stuff.

460
00:20:05,176 --> 00:20:08,116
You know, like
throw turtles at birds?

461
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:09,845
Any time you want, kid.

462
00:20:09,852 --> 00:20:11,722
But whatever we do, from now on,

463
00:20:11,723 --> 00:20:14,703
let's leave
the violence behind, uh?

464
00:20:14,695 --> 00:20:17,095
(grunts)
Aah!

465
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,637
Ah.
There you go, kid.

466
00:20:19,638 --> 00:20:22,038
- You earned that.
- No, I haven't.

467
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:24,653
And that's what makes it
all the sweeter.
