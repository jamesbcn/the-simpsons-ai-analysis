1
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:11,245
The bidding stands
at eight million dollars.

2
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:12,313
Nine million.

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,414
Ten million.

4
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:14,415
11 million!

5
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:17,085
$15 million.

6
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,587
Joan Miró's The Poetess,

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,556
going once, going twice, sold.

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,259
To billionaire tech mogul
Megan Matheson.

9
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:35,869
Don't take that painting,
I love it!

10
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:38,372
I won't let you take it!

11
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:05,399
There you have it,
Ms. Matheson,

12
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:09,303
Joan Miró's The Poetess.

13
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,473
My painting's been stolen.

14
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:14,275
That's impossible.

15
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:18,078
It's a mystery so baffling,
only one man can solve it.

16
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:20,781
Get me Manacek.

17
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,653
Thank goodness you're here,
Mr. Manacek.

18
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,855
You're the best freelance
insurance investigator

19
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,657
in the business.

20
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,158
Oh, well, isn't that
just what we need?

21
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:42,162
Some smug pretty boy
out to make us cops look stupid.

22
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:44,865
Ah, Clancy,
you're looking well...

23
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,867
- Fed.
- See?

24
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,037
He put that pause between
those two words deliberately.

25
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,341
Maybe I did, maybe I... didn't.

26
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:56,444
Well, two can play at that...

27
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:00,013
pause.

28
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:02,049
Three people bid
on the stolen painting.

29
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,717
Nuclear magnate Mr. Burns,

30
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:05,553
venture capitalist
Megan Matheson

31
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,755
and mini golf cheat
Homer Simpson.

32
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,189
They're all suspects.

33
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:10,758
I don't mind
telling you, Manacek...

34
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,093
I hope you fall flat
on your face.

35
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:15,563
I hope not.

36
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,231
My mother's rather fond of it.

37
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:18,866
Damn your wit.

38
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,887
Look, Manacek, I don't
know why you're talking to me.

39
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,590
It's my painting
that was stolen.

40
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:45,593
Yes, but you insured
a $15 million painting

41
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,595
for $30 million.

42
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:50,798
For a woman with a head
for numbers, it doesn't add up.

43
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,933
You smug son of a bitch.

44
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,270
I like you, Manacek.

45
00:03:56,304 --> 00:03:59,139
But you should be talking
to the real painting thief.

46
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,743
The man I outbid,
Montgomery Burns.

47
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:05,613
That's quite a workout
you're getting.

48
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,948
Although, I can think
of a better one.

49
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,484
Sorry, but I'm in
a committed relationship

50
00:04:10,518 --> 00:04:12,620
with the former Miss Denmark.

51
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:15,989
She's created a breed
of mosquito that cures malaria.

52
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:19,760
Well, if she invents a cure
for commitment, let me know.

53
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:28,936
Pull.

54
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,504
Shoot.

55
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:32,306
Nice shot, Mr. Burns.

56
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,309
You're a natural
in the ancient art of skeet.

57
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:37,611
Oh, spare me
your flattery, Manacek.

58
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,112
I know why you're here.

59
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:40,848
You think I stole
that ridiculous painting.

60
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,115
Absurd.

61
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:45,118
A little clay pigeon told me

62
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:49,022
that you couldn't stand
being outbid by a woman.

63
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:52,493
Pull, pull, pull!

64
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,997
Looks like the only thing being
hit around here...

65
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,666
is a nerve.

66
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,502
I'll blast that smile
right off your smug face.

67
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:04,672
I like you, Manacek.

68
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,840
But it's obvious
who took the painting.

69
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,876
That lunatic who said he'd do
anything to have it.

70
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,679
Homer Simpson.

71
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,814
I... Did you bring that
with you?

72
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,383
It's inflatable.

73
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,485
I got it at Brookstone.

74
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,031
I don't know what help I can be
with your case, Mr. Manacek.

75
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,701
As you can see,
I'm a very busy man.

76
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:40,508
According to my sources,
Lenny...

77
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,875
you were obsessed
with that painting.

78
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,411
I myself was once obsessed

79
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:45,713
with a suede sports jacket
with leather pockets.

80
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:47,548
I would have done anything
to get it.

81
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,249
Even steal a painting.

82
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:52,252
Me? Obsessed with
some stupid painting?

83
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,054
That's absurd.

84
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:57,357
- Is it?
- You're right.

85
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,059
I'd do anything
to have that painting.

86
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,194
Lie, kill, steal.
Well, not kill.

87
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,196
But I would steal it,
and then lie about it.

88
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,264
But I didn't steal it.

89
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,399
And I'm not lying.

90
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:06,767
Believe me, or I'll kill you.

91
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:09,903
I like you, Manacek.

92
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:11,038
I'll kill you!

93
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:13,674
I like you.

94
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,876
Mr. Simpson,
there's more to your story

95
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,545
than you're letting on.

96
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:19,513
And I'm gonna find out what.

97
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,415
Please don't.

98
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:32,760
The pizza delivery boys get
better looking all the time.

99
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:35,395
I'm Homer Simpson's wife.

100
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:38,098
I love wives. They never
pester you to marry them.

101
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,434
Geez, you've got a lot of lines.

102
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:44,438
You will too, after I show you
my corduroy sheets.

103
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:46,774
Mr. Manacek,
my husband is a wreck.

104
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:50,911
Please, just give me a chance
to convince you he's innocent.

105
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,446
Only if it's over dinner.

106
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,548
Okay.

107
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,917
More Frito pie, Mr. Manacek?

108
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,153
Sure, why not?

109
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:08,896
If he's not guilty
of stealing that painting,

110
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,731
why is Homer cowering
on the stairs,

111
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,366
eating cereal
straight from the box?

112
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,239
Well, Homer's so quick to panic.

113
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,774
It's his only flaw.

114
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:23,310
Marge, I need you
to be straight with me.

115
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,846
Okay, I admit it,
he has many flaws.

116
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,180
Thousands. Flaws.

117
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,982
Everywhere, flaws.

118
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:31,351
Your husband doesn't really seem
like a typical art lover,

119
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,453
but he shows exquisite taste

120
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:36,524
in the female form.

121
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,692
Hey, Front Pockets,
quit hitting on my mom.

122
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:42,863
She only loves one stocky man
in tight pants, our dad.

123
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,865
Sorry, I can only solve
impossible crimes

124
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,600
if I'm seducing
an amazing woman.

125
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,335
It's my process.

126
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,037
I'll tell you everything I know
about Homer

127
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,705
for one of those Tiparillos.

128
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,206
No Tiparillos.

129
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,875
- Women.
- Women.

130
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,444
I like you, Manacek.

131
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,112
So let me clue you in
on the real story

132
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,848
about my dad and that painting.

133
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:03,617
Homer was chaperoning my class
field trip to the art museum,

134
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:06,453
and he was not happy about it.

135
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,788
Come on, come on.
Hurry up in there.

136
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,356
Three to a urinal.

137
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,192
No hand washing,
or we'll be late for lunch.

138
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:17,197
Sheesh, look at
that stupid painting.

139
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,799
What is it even supposed to be?

140
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,467
Art should be of pretty ladies,

141
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,970
hunting dogs with dead rabbits,
Bible crap

142
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,538
and 3-D sidewalk drawings

143
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:26,239
where it looks like
you could fall in.

144
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,162
I get it.

145
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,431
I... get... it.

146
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,602
Mr. Simpson, some of the kids
went to the gift shop.

147
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,937
We were only supposed
to bring five dollars,

148
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,606
but some brought more.

149
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,273
Wha... Wha... What?

150
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,610
Oh, right. Chaperone.

151
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,955
This is warm beer.

152
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,957
That's an '07 Michelob.

153
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,426
Homer was saving it
for a special occasion.

154
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,131
Yes.

155
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:27,635
My husband just couldn't stop
thinking about that painting.

156
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:54,327
Wha...? Honey,

157
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,396
I love a painting.

158
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,632
Oh, what is it of? Grapes?

159
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,968
- No.
- Flowers?

160
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,335
- No.
- Peaches?

161
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,937
No.

162
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,472
You sure it's a painting?

163
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:08,241
I'm positive. I touched it
when no one was looking.

164
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,678
Well, there's nothing wrong
with being an art lover

165
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,846
as long
as it's representational.

166
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,650
It is representational,
isn't it?

167
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:19,920
Tell me it's representational.

168
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,923
What else about
our marriage is a lie?

169
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,192
Are you really
a licensed DJ?

170
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,227
I took the courses,
but I failed the test!

171
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:31,498
A blue-collar Joe
suddenly likes modern art?

172
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,701
That story and two bits
will get you a cup of coffee.

173
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,703
What year do you think it is?

174
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:37,437
Hey, who's the shamus here?

175
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,172
I'm telling you, deep down,

176
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,441
my dad is really sensitive.

177
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,847
Oh, good, you're awake.

178
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,783
You're the only one
I can talk to about... this.

179
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:51,284
I know that painting.

180
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,221
It's called The Poetess
by Joan Miró.

181
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,890
Why does it bring me such peace?

182
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:58,692
Why?!

183
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:01,028
See? Even though
the painting is abstract,

184
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,697
that yellow circle
can represent the sun.

185
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:06,333
Or Pac-Man at rest.

186
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:09,502
Dad, you think art sucks.
Snap out of it.

187
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:14,574
Wow. I mean, wow.

188
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,643
Every time I look at it
from a different angle,

189
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,179
I see something new.

190
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,182
I just want to take a moment

191
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,051
to acknowledge
that for the first time,

192
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:26,820
you're dragging me
into the museum.

193
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:29,256
Yeah, it's a topsy-turvy world.

194
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,125
Beach volleyball's bigger
than regular volleyball.

195
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,064
Sorry, pally. Sorry, gally.

196
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,266
But the museum's
closed down for good.

197
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,334
Can we go in and look

198
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,336
at our favorite painting
one last time?

199
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,038
It's called The Poetess.

200
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:47,007
Oh, it's right there,
inside the crate

201
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,508
that's going
to the auction house,

202
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,943
where a billionaire will buy it

203
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:51,611
and you'll never see it again.

204
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,814
Oh, and I'll have to
take that too.

205
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,586
Now museum, now you don't.

206
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,454
The Springfield Museum
of Fine Art

207
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,857
is the latest victim
of this city's budget woes.

208
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,626
The storied institution
has closed its doors forever.

209
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,096
Its legendary art collection
will be sold at auction

210
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,464
and its docents
released into the wild.

211
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:12,966
The closure is being protested

212
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,534
by a coalition
of local art lovers

213
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,469
and homeless bathroom users.

214
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,305
Picasso, Goya,

215
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,207
Cézanne, Dalí,

216
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,942
selling off artwork

217
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,543
would be folly.

218
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:28,448
We're here, Vermeer,
get used to it!

219
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,717
People, people.
Government is about

220
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,652
making tough choices.

221
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,487
This was not one of them.

222
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,623
Museum attendance was near zero.

223
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:39,126
We lost thousands
on stolen audio wands.

224
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,162
What do people want with wands?

225
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:44,664
These wands

226
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,499
are putting the hurt
on these walnuts.

227
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:49,402
Notice how Edward Hopper's
use of windows

228
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,571
invites the viewer
into the scene

229
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,306
but also keeps them at bay.

230
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,009
But Mayor Quimby,

231
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:57,677
the Springfield Museum
of Fine Art,

232
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,646
or SMOFA, was a jewel.

233
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,649
SMOFA was the one institution
of genuine culture

234
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,317
our town could be proud of.

235
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:05,853
Stop saying SMOFA.

236
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,320
It never caught on.

237
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:08,922
Excuse me, Mayor SMOFA.

238
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,991
I'm not like these brainy
tote bags over here.

239
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,827
I like my crusts stuffed,
my martial arts mixed,

240
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:16,196
and my movies fully Sandler-ed.

241
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,531
But there's this painting
from that museum,

242
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,167
and when I really look at it,

243
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,769
only one word
explains what I feel.

244
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,038
What is it again?

245
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:27,875
Transgender.

246
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:29,843
Transcendent.

247
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:31,879
Transcendence
doesn't fill potholes

248
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,280
or educate our children.

249
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,948
Did you know we had to lay off

250
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,783
a third of the police force?

251
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,685
That's right. Eddie.

252
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,354
I used to have a gun.

253
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,694
Fine, sell the artwork.

254
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:49,963
Let's move on
to the next protest.

255
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:53,700
Too many poke restaurants.

256
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,635
Poke is just okay.

257
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,338
Poke is just okay.

258
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:02,075
At Water's Edge
by Paul Cézanne,

259
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:05,078
sold for $65 million.

260
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:08,415
Yeah! I'm as happy
as Steve Martin.

261
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:11,952
It's... Oh, God, no.

262
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:16,756
Our last item is The Poetess
by Joan Miró.

263
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,659
The bidding starts
at five million dollars.

264
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,228
I bid that.

265
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:24,264
- What are you doing?
- I have a plan to get the painting.

266
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:25,933
Six million dollars.

267
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,301
I think we can do
better than that.

268
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,837
I need this painting

269
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,006
for my private monkey sanctuary
in Costa Rica.

270
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,443
The monkeys find the colors
quite arousing.

271
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,245
Seven million dollars.

272
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,180
- Eight million.
- Nine million.

273
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,682
Sir, we attempted
to verify your funds

274
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,284
at the First Bank of Moe's.

275
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:47,087
The man at the phone
threatened to boil our skulls

276
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,421
and make them into...

277
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,490
rat toilets.

278
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,127
It's okay, Dad.

279
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:56,296
You just really loved
that painting.

280
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,399
The bidding stands
at eight million dollars.

281
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,434
- Nine million.
- Ten million.

282
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:02,435
11 million.

283
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:05,138
$15 million.

284
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:07,640
Joan Miró's The Poetess,

285
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:10,477
going once, going twice, sold.

286
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,313
To billionaire tech mogul
Megan Matheson.

287
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:23,656
Don't take that painting,
I love it!

288
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,393
I won't let you take it!

289
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,995
Your story had everything.

290
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:30,830
A field trip, a dream sequence,
Sideshow Mel...

291
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,633
and it gave your father
the perfect motive

292
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,068
to steal that painting.

293
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,337
A deeper connection
to his daughter.

294
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,906
Well, maybe,
but I'm sure he's innocent.

295
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,409
Mom, Lisa, 1970s horndog,

296
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,743
Dad's run off.

297
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,445
He's on the lam!

298
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,914
You know, once I send
your husband to prison,

299
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,483
you'll be kind of single.

300
00:15:56,456 --> 00:16:00,360
It seems Homer escaped
out this window.

301
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:04,331
In all my years
as an investigator,

302
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,966
I've never seen a trellis
take such a pounding.

303
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,368
I know it looks bad,

304
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,170
but think
about what we told you.

305
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:13,540
My husband could never
have stolen that painting.

306
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,208
Thank you, Marge.

307
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,710
I now know exactly
how everything happened.

308
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:19,146
How do you know that?

309
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,680
I'll be happy to explain...

310
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,382
over breakfast?

311
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:25,285
You have
a real problem with women.

312
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,188
I know.
I'm seeing a therapist...

313
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,557
tonight at my place.

314
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,193
Oh, get out.
Go, go!

315
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,868
White chocolate...
the loneliest chocolate.

316
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,371
Homer, I know you're in there.

317
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,039
How did you find me?

318
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:48,075
I knew you'd return
to the scene of the crime

319
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,143
where your inner peace
was stolen.

320
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:52,079
You can't bring me in.
You're not a cop.

321
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,547
You're not even a regular
insurance investigator.

322
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,383
You're freelance.
You don't get paid

323
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,017
unless you submit an invoice.

324
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:01,421
Which lets me control
when my corporate year ends.

325
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,656
You're always one step ahead.

326
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,427
I don't like you, Manacek.

327
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,496
Your family's story
of how you fell in love

328
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,531
with that painting
did prove your innocence.

329
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,101
- How?
- By providing one crucial fact.

330
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,868
You're too dumb
to steal anything.

331
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,270
Maybe I did take it.

332
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:19,772
- Trust me, you didn't.
- I could have.

333
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:22,008
But I know you didn't.
That's what I'm saying.

334
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,211
- I'm smart.
- You're dumb.

335
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,880
After careful consideration
of facts and evidence

336
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,282
observed only by me,

337
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:31,718
I can reveal
who stole The Poetess.

338
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,220
Ms. Matheson.

339
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:36,289
Your last IPO was DOA,

340
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:38,291
and you needed the cash
to keep your girlfriend

341
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:39,926
in hybrid mosquito larva.

342
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,928
I've seen it a thousand times.

343
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,630
Impossible!
The armed guards

344
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,632
never let the painting
out of their sight.

345
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:49,469
But which armed guards?

346
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:52,572
It was a simple matter
of finding

347
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,107
the guards' identical twins,

348
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:56,909
then hiring them to rob
their own brothers.

349
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:00,313
That's the last
impossible mystery

350
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:03,283
you'll ever solve.

351
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,418
Well done, Mr. Manacek.

352
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:06,986
Who would have suspected

353
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,289
it was the person none of us
had ever met before?

354
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,824
Yes, it's a shame she went
through all that trouble

355
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:13,160
to steal a painting...

356
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:15,162
that had already been stolen...

357
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,297
by you.

358
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,266
Not yet, sir.

359
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:22,469
I mean, how dare you accuse me
of such a crime?

360
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:24,337
But the painting
was safely in our vault

361
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:26,506
until it left the auction house.

362
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,642
But which auction house?

363
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,444
It was a simple matter

364
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:33,846
of Burns building
an identical auction house

365
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,515
next door to the real one.

366
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,450
The actual painting
never left the vault,

367
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:40,853
so Burns could steal it
at his leisure.

368
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,156
- Now?
- Yes, sir.

369
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,465
My painting!

370
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:55,134
Oh, thank goodness
those thieves didn't get you.

371
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:58,538
It's a shame I punched out
a woman and an old man over...

372
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,640
a gift shop tote bag.

373
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:03,810
Lisa?

374
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:07,180
It wasn't my plan to steal it.

375
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,318
That painting
was the first thing

376
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,653
my dad and I
ever had in common.

377
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:16,356
I couldn't bear
to see him lose it.

378
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,991
It was a simple matter

379
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:21,528
of switching my canvas tote bag
for the painting

380
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:24,431
before it was
even auctioned off.

381
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,200
I knew it was wrong,

382
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:28,868
but isn't it a worse crime

383
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,337
to let some billionaire

384
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,071
hide art away

385
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,442
where guys like my dad
can never fall in love with it?

386
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:42,081
So, who gets The Poetess now?

387
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,750
Ten million dollars.

388
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,085
Ownership of the painting
reverts back to the city.

389
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,587
But where will we hang it?

390
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,589
We're knocking down
the art museum.

391
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,591
And what are you doing
with the money Springfield got

392
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,092
from selling
all the public's art?

393
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,262
Well, we're building

394
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:58,030
certain vitally needed
civic improvements.

395
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:03,703
Everything I love
in one place.

396
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,872
Beer. Hot dog.

397
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:09,208
Bathroom. Painting. Daughter.

398
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:10,777
Marge, you're a beautiful woman,

399
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,379
but you're loyal
to your husband.

400
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:13,946
And I respect that.

401
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,284
But if things were different,
would I have a shot?

402
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,952
You are the most conceited,

403
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:22,255
chauvinistic, son of a...

404
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:25,292
I like you, Manacek.
