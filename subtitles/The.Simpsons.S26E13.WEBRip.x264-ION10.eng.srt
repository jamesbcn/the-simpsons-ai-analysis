00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,920
Occupied.

178
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:26,875
Ah!

179
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,217
(crowd screaming)

180
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,762
Stop fearing me!

181
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,806
(sobbing)

182
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,984
Damn it!

183
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,824
Please keep spinning it.

184
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,439
I don't want to look at it.

185
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,396
Can't you say something
to make me feel better?

186
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,067
(sighs)

187
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,235
I'm sorry, but I can't.

188
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,294
I'm tired of you saying
planes have gotten smaller

189
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,579
and two presidents
were fatter than you, and...

190
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,544
(sighs)

191
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,043
Fine, I got it.

192
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,384
Starting right now,
a yearlong juice cleanse.

193
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,210
Every morning, I get a colonic,

194
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,795
and I sleep in a sauna every night.

195
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,131
Oh, that's not a healthy way
to lose weight.

196
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,968
It's not about health, Marge,
it's about going crazy.

197
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,515
You don't have to do this alone.

198
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,889
What the...?

199
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:20,846
Hmm.

200
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,952
(sighs)
This is it.

201
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:42,044
My name is Roy, and this week
I gained seven pounds.

202
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,381
Yes!

203
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,748
No shame there!

204
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,625
You go, girth!

205
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,592
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry.

206
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,382
I thought you were
Over-Feeders Anonymous.

207
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,386
No, no.
In fact, quite the opposite.

208
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,468
We are Big Is Beautiful.

209
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,224
So you guys are proud
of what you are?

210
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,807
We do not cower in the shadows,
we make the shadows.

211
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,063
Do you guys serve snacks?

212
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,605
We've got ice cream hoagies,

213
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,318
deep-fried sugar bags,
Dorsnickos, Snickeritos,

214
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,989
Milky Snicks, Porksicles,
and of course diet soda.

215
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,319
(murmurs of agreement)

216
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,324
Yes, mustn't forget the diet soda.

217
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,486
I have so many questions for you.

218
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,865
First of all,
is this floor reinforced?

219
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,251
You know,
maybe I shouldn't be here.

220
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,713
I promised my wife I'd lose weight.

221
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,673
Huh?

222
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,053
MAN:
If I may.

223
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,633
{\an8}HOMER: Ooh, labeled.

224
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:36,715
Our loved ones, though precious,
can often be a hurdle.

225
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,472
-Who are you?
-I'm the founder

226
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,474
of our little group, Albert.

227
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,176
Ooh, like Fat Albert!

228
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,636
We never use the word "fat" here.

229
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,807
-Sorry.
-My dear fat friend,

230
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,646
all your wife needs
is a little education.

231
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,862
Now repeat after me.

232
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,321
I am big.

233
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,651
I am big.

234
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,486
I am beautiful.

235
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,411
I have a beauty of a sort to some.

236
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,541
No one can make me feel bad
about who I am

237
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,579
because this is who I am!

238
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,584
Ditto!

239
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,375
You know, I've always wanted

240
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,128
to blindly follow somebody,

241
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,170
and I think
you just might be the guy.

242
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,594
Marge, kids,

243
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,683
tonight was a turning point
in my life.

244
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,049
Well, that's great, Homie.

245
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,255
Just let me finish
uploading this photo.

246
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,846
HOMER:
No, Marge, you have to listen!

247
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,982
That place you sent me to
changed my life.

248
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,690
Thank you, Lord!

249
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,690
And I'll give up
online scrapbooking,

250
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,982
like I promised.

251
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,443
They taught me that I don't
need to lose weight.

252
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,607
I should just be proud
of what I am.

253
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,856
What?

254
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,657
Restore, restore!

255
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,660
<i>(buzzer sounds)</i>

256
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,042
I met a guy...

257
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,699
a wonderful guy...

258
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,207
Oh, Lord.

259
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,578
It's not what you think.

260
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,825
His name is Albert,

261
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,286
and he taught me
not to buy into the lies

262
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,247
taught by Big Nutrition.

263
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,297
That's worse than what I thought.

264
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,801
Marge, you're my wife
of ten years and I love you,

265
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,934
but I must observe
the teachings of this man

266
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,642
I just met tonight.

267
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,563
Now, the first thing
I have to do is make amends.

268
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,522
With the bathroom scale.

269
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,152
I'm so sorry
I threw you across the room

270
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,770
and called you a liar.

271
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,607
When you told me
I was 260 pounds,

272
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,953
you were just encouraging me.

273
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:21,158
It was a poem you were writing
about my potential.

274
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,530
I'm gonna start celebrating
my size,

275
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,947
and I need you with me
as a partner.

276
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,326
Now, if you'll excuse me,

277
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,043
I need to talk
to the broken porch swing.

278
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,674
HOMER:
So, from now on,

279
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,421
you guys can no longer say
these hateful words:

280
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,713
"chubby, chunky, blobbo, slobbo,

281
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:40,257
fat bastard, Michelin Man,
Stay Puft, Chumbawumba,

282
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,642
'It is balloon!',

283
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,719
Papa Grande, Augustus Gloop,

284
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,224
beached whale, big-boned,
Wisconsin skinny,

285
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,597
butterball, dump truck,
Jelly Belly, pudgy-wudgy,

286
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,895
lard-ass, blubberino,
Buddha belly,

287
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,859
Hurry Eat Tubman,
one-ton soup,

288
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,399
Blob Saget, Chub Hub,
Calvin Cool Whip,

289
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,614
Manfred Mannboobs,
21 Lump Street,

290
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,534
walking 'before' picture, fatso,
Harvey Milk Chocolate,

291
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,704
Obese Want Cannoli,
Mahatma Gumbo,

292
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,994
Salvador Deli, Elmer Pantry,

293
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,867
KFC and the Sponge Cake Band,
Snackie Onassis,

294
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,916
The Foody Blues,
Hoagie Carmichael

295
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,170
and wide load."

296
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,921
What about Mr. Two Belts?

297
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,093
Good, good!

298
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,421
By which I mean,
"Bad, bad!"

299
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,127
You know, as long as
we're opening this up--

300
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,837
and I'm glad you are--

301
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,217
I want to tell you guys that
when you call me a gargoyle,

302
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:29,104
a troll, or a homunculus,
it kind of hurts my feelings.

303
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,483
What? You're kidding.

304
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,769
We never dreamed.

305
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,732
Who knew goblins had feelings?

306
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,483
You see?
That's what I'm talking about. Because...

307
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,574
CROWD (chanting):
We're big! We're proud!

308
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,570
Two of us can make a crowd!

309
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,992
Sorry, fellas.
There's a movement I have to join.

310
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,412
I've learned there's something
more important than drinking:

311
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,412
eating.

312
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:52,084
Thank you for the easy financing!

313
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,924
What the...?!

314
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,919
Your store is forcing
unattainable body images

315
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,422
on our young people.

316
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,514
I say, end the thinsanity!

317
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,340
You, my friend, are wrong.

318
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:07,425
Every girl should look like
a sexy praying mantis from Milan

319
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,933
whose hips are narrower

320
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,604
than an Italian
parliamentary majority.

321
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,024
Whew.

322
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,272
(siren whoops)

323
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,864
Okay, people, show's over.

324
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,609
Nothing to eat here.

325
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,031
Now move along.

326
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:20,939
If you can.

327
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,276
If not,
we're gonna have to take you in.

328
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,162
Clancy, what are you doing?

329
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,449
You're one of us!

330
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,912
You're right.

331
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,122
Take me in, Lou.

332
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,702
Ow, ah.

333
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:32,907
(grunting)

334
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,037
Hey! Why?

335
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,383
Ah, geez, Lou.

336
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,088
You seem to be enjoying this.

337
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,748
Just doing my job, Chief.

338
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:40,957
(Taser crackles)

339
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,336
Oh, that's some nice
Tase work, Lou.

340
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,593
(grunting)

341
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,046
Homer Simpson?

342
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,307
HOMER:
Right here!

343
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,848
Excuse me. Pardon me.

344
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,391
Coming through.

345
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,894
Coming back. Excuse me.

346
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,226
Pardon me. There we go.

347
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,561
Uh, coming up.

348
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,765
What can I do for you?

349
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,265
You're free on bail.

350
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,033
People, give thanks
to that woman,

351
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,490
standing up for all of us,
even though she's a lighty.

352
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,742
Thank you.

353
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,333
Although,
I think the worst thing

354
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,658
that ever happened to my husband
was joining your group.

355
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,745
(crowd gasps, murmurs)

356
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:14,709
(clears throat)

357
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,288
I'll handle this.

358
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,463
What is the point of a long life
if it's not enjoyed?

359
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,713
(drooling moan)

360
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,554
Homer, you have to choose.

361
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,130
And I think the choice is clear.

362
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,144
Guys, I'm coming back in!

363
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,556
Suck in your guts.

364
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,805
(all inhaling)

365
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,147
(sighs) Home.

366
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,652
(groans)

367
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,580
(laughing)

368
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,159
Whee! Whee!

369
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,584
Who's he giving a piggyback ride to?

370
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,874
We don't know.

371
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,877
Mom, what's wrong?

372
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,419
How come Dad's not with you?

373
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,842
Are they setting bail by the pound?
(laughs)

374
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,551
He chose to spend the night
in a jail with strangers

375
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,803
instead of me.

376
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,224
Mom, Lisa and I learned

377
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,182
that we can solve any problem
through song.

378
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,183
Lisa, let's go write something
that'll change Dad's mind.

379
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,426
Do you really think

380
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,478
that we can write a song
that does that?

381
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,191
I just wanted to get
out of the room.

382
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,021
She was really bumming me out.

383
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,028
Ah, geez.

384
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,701
I thought writing another hit song
would be easier.

385
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,990
Well, it would've helped if you
hadn't crumpled up all the paper

386
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,954
before we wrote anything on it.

387
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,285
No more judgment!

388
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,710
No more jokes!

389
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,328
We will not be made
to feel less than

390
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,456
because we are greater than!

391
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,344
I was distinctly promised no math!

392
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,802
Homer, I want to say something
extremely important

393
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,973
the way a woman does--
subtly, through someone else.

394
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,223
Kids...

395
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,814
<i>♪ ♪</i>

396
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,770
-Take it, Bart!
-You take it!

397
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,141
I gave it to you!

398
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,437
I refuse to accept it!

399
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,060
LENNY:
Just start the song!

400
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,397
We couldn't write a song.

401
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,941
We're one-hit wonders.

402
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,395
But is that such a crime?

403
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,034
Look at J.D. Salinger.

404
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,361
<i>Franny and Zooey.</i>

405
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,486
Rubik's Cube!

406
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,662
Rubik's Snake!

407
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,740
Charles M. Schulz.

408
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,905
You've got me there.

409
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,373
It's her fault.

410
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,043
She was sucking all the gangsta
out of everything.

411
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,791
Well, you're the only
"gangsta" I know

412
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,463
with a 9:00 bedtime.

413
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,041
9:30, starting in summer.
Mom said.

414
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,917
Ah, kids, stop arguing.

415
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,804
Or keep arguing.

416
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,421
I don't care.

417
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,467
Homer, I'm sorry I tried to help you
control your weight.

418
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,972
(sighs)
I'm not sure of anything anymore.

419
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,055
Sorry I ever opened my mouth.

420
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,850
Marge, it's not your fault

421
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:43,153
that you can't win against
a superior being like Albert.

422
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,478
(slurps)

423
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,571
Mmm.

424
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,938
But, Marge, I don't want you
to ever stop caring about me.

425
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,737
How can you follow a leader
who won't even get up out of his chair?

426
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,451
Marge,
I believe you're forgetting

427
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:58,241
America's greatest wartime
wheelchair-bound leader:

428
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,617
Professor X of the X-Men.

429
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,334
It's not that Professor X
wouldn't get up,

430
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,825
it's that he couldn't!

431
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,747
Well, I'll show you who can get up!

432
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,166
(triumphant music playing)

433
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,431
(footsteps thudding heavily)

434
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,516
(roars)

435
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,638
That's right!

436
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,314
I don't need this scooter!

437
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,602
All of you,

438
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,225
follow me to the future!

439
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,943
(groans)

440
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,899
Oh, dear God.

441
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,154
Stick a forklift in him, he's dead.

442
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,697
(laughs)

443
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,525
(organ playing solemn music)

444
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,843
I've never written a eulogy before,

445
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,803
but this time, I did.

446
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:58,473
Unfortunately, I left it at home.

447
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,184
Thanks, lady.

448
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,774
What Albert taught us
is that all people have pride

449
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,811
and no group should ever
be insulted.

450
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,225
He knew what was important

451
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,233
was how you lived your life every day.

452
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,856
Till he was taken from us too soon,

453
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,904
at the age of...

454
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,158
(whispering)

455
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,449
Twenty-three?!

456
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,082
People, for God's sake,
join a gym!

457
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,580
(crowd murmuring)

458
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,621
Kumiko, would you still love me
if I lost weight?

459
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,666
-Much more!
-(sighs)

460
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,999
Marge,
I'm sorry I was proud of myself.

461
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,665
That's not really what I was...

462
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,423
It will never happen again!

463
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,835
Now come on.
Let's <i>walk</i> home.

464
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,764
Absolutely.

465
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,263
Can I ask you something?

466
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,514
What is it that
keeps you with me?

467
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,347
It's because everything you love,

468
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,693
you love so much.

469
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,188
Because you love me,

470
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,610
I will not stop yo-yo dieting
till I get it right.

471
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,860
Oh...

472
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,882
At last.

473
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,250
Well done, Dad.

474
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,047
You finally reached emotional maturity.

475
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,551
Unlike Bart.

476
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,303
{\an8}Bart's very mature.

477
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,394
{\an8}Take it from the little boy
in his tummy.

478
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,100
{\an8}Now, when do I get
to be the head again?

479
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,141
{\an8}-Soon.
-It's always "soon."

480
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,636
{\an8}(Milhouse sighs)

481
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,364
Whoa!

482
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,993
(horse neighs)

483
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,660
Oh. I wish I had said that earlier.

484
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,161
Shh!

485
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,956
