00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,902
(reading)

177
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,357
-What's that extra "B" For?
-That's a typo.

178
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,867
Dad, can't you have
some other kind of party--

179
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,779
one where you
don't serve meat?

180
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,247
But all normal people
love meat.

181
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,368
If I went to a barbecue
and there was no meat

182
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,415
I would say, "Yo, goober,
where's the meat?"

183
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,460
I'm trying to impress
people here, Lisa.

184
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,384
You don't win friends
with salad.

185
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,132
(conga beat)
<i>♪ You don't win friends with salad ♪</i>

186
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,724
<i>♪ You don't win friends</i>

194
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,476
Mom!

195
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,773
I didn't mean to take sides.

196
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:25,975
I just got caught up
in the rhythm.

197
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,605
Good morning, class.

198
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,242
A certain agitator--

199
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:33,319
for privacy's sake,
let's call her Lisa S.

200
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,486
No, that's too obvious.

201
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,035
Let's say L. Simpson--

202
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,249
has raised questions

203
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,908
about certain school policies.

204
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,247
So in the interest of
creating an open dialogue,

205
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,922
sit silently
and watch this film.

206
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,131
<i>Nothing beats a stroll</i>
<i>in cattle country.</i>

207
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,846
<i>Hi. I'm Troy McClure.</i>

208
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,219
<i>You may remember me from</i>
<i>such educational films as</i>

209
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,017
<i>"Two Minus Three</i>
<i>Equals Negative Fun!"</i>

210
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,771
<i>And "Firecrackers:</i>
<i>The Silent Killer."</i>

211
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,064
<i>BOY: Mr. McClure?</i>

212
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,727
<i>-Oh, Hello, Bobby.</i>
<i>-Jimmy.</i>

213
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,605
<i>I'm curious as to how meat</i>

214
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,322
<i>gets from the ranch</i>
<i>to my stomach.</i>

215
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,402
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa,</i>
<i>slow down, Jimmy.</i>

216
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,157
<i>You just asked</i>
<i>a mouthful.</i>

217
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:18,369
<i>It all starts here in</i>
<i>the high-density feed lot.</i>

218
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,291
<i>Then when the cattle</i>
<i>are just right...</i>

219
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,459
<i>Mmm...</i>

220
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,458
<i>It's time for them</i>
<i>to graduate</i>

221
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,630
<i>from Bovine University.</i>

222
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,379
<i>(buzzer)</i>

223
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,261
<i>Come on, Jimmy.</i>

224
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,381
<i>Let's take a peek</i>
<i>at the killing floor.</i>

225
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,967
<i>(gasps)</i>

226
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,092
<i>Don't let the name</i>
<i>throw you, Jimmy.</i>

227
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,968
<i>It's not really a floor.</i>

228
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,715
<i>It's more of a steel grating</i>
<i>that allows material</i>

229
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,516
<i>to sluice through so it can</i>
<i>be collected and exported.</i>

230
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,482
<i>(cows screaming)</i>

231
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,660
<i>Getting hungry, Jimmy?</i>

232
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:03,451
<i>Uh, Mr. McClure,</i>
<i>I have a crazy friend</i>

233
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,667
<i>who says</i>
<i>it's wrong to eat meat.</i>

234
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,288
<i>Is he crazy?</i>

235
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,495
<i>No, just ignorant.</i>

236
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,955
<i>You see,</i>
<i>your crazy friend</i>

237
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,295
<i>never heard</i>
<i>of the "food chain".</i>

238
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,554
<i>Just ask this scientician.</i>

239
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,763
<i>Um...</i>

240
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,802
<i>He'll tell you that in nature</i>

241
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,256
<i>one creature invariably</i>
<i>eats another to survive.</i>

242
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,267
<i>(roaring)</i>

243
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,019
<i>(eagle screeches,</i>
<i>sheep bleats)</i>

244
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,021
<i>(growls)</i>

245
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,562
<i>Don't kid yourself, Jimmy.</i>

246
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,107
<i>If a cow ever got</i>
<i>the chance</i>

247
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,900
<i>he'd eat you and</i>
<i>everyone you care about.</i>

248
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,329
<i>Wow, Mr. McClure,</i>
<i>I was a grade-A moron</i>

249
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,079
<i>to ever question eating meat.</i>

250
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,040
<i>Yes, you were, Jimmy.</i>

251
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,752
<i>Yes, you were.</i>

252
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,832
<i>Ow. You're hurting me.</i>

253
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,457
<i>(mooing)</i>

254
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,665
They can't seriously expect us
to swallow that tripe.

255
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,546
Now, as a special treat courtesy
of our friends at the Meat Council,

256
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,224
please help yourselves
to this tripe.

257
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,052
(cheering)

258
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,016
Stop it!
Stop it!

259
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,100
Don't you realize
you've just been brainwashed

260
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,944
by corporate propaganda?

261
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:13,109
Apparently my crazy friend here
hasn't heard of the food chain.

262
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,530
Yeah, Lisa's
a grade-A moron.

263
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,070
When I grow up, I'm going
to Bovine University.

264
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,656
Hi, Homer.

265
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,495
Thanks for inviting me
to your barbecue.

266
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,460
Wow, Barney, you brought
a whole beer keg.

267
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,881
Yeah, where can
I fill it up?

268
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,288
Wait, Dad.

269
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,409
Good news, everyone.
You don't have to eat meat.

270
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,667
I made enough gazpacho for all.

271
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:12,959
(all murmuring)

272
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,342
What is that anyway?

273
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:17,508
It's tomato soup
served ice cold.

274
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,628
(laughing)

275
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:22,967
BARNEY: Go back to Russia.

276
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:37,484
Ah, diagnosis: Delicious.

277
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,686
I've got the prescription
for you, doctor.

278
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,107
Another hot beef
injection.

279
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,406
(laughing)

280
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,486
Hey, Homer, wing me another
one of them, uh...

281
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,657
burgers, would you?

282
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:54,376
Can't quite seem to... stand up
under my own power anymore.

283
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,248
One whopper for the copper.

284
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,092
Can I have a burger, Dad?

285
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,631
Here you go!

286
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,974
It's bad enough
they're all eating meat.

287
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,470
They don't have
to rub it in my face.

288
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,763
Ah!

289
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,517
Okay, everybody,

290
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,730
it's the moment
you've all been waiting for...

291
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,441
the pig de resistance.

292
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,772
ALL: Ooh!

293
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,227
Ah!

294
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,186
(laughing)

295
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,237
Look at his nose.

296
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,569
Congratulations, Homer.

297
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,744
Your Q's a huge success.

298
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:29,083
A toast to the host who
can boast the most roast.

299
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,159
(chuckles)
Thanks, Flanders.

300
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,785
I have to agree
that everything certainly--

301
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,924
Huh?

302
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,080
(gasping)

303
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,297
Bart, no!

304
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,298
What?

305
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,589
Sorry. Force of habit.

306
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,722
Lisa, no!

307
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,144
Ah! Oh!

308
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,769
(groaning)

309
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,355
It's just a little dirty.

310
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,520
It's still good.
It's still good.

311
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,648
(honking)

312
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,164
It's just a little slimy.

313
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,568
It's still good.
It's still good.

314
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,844
It's just
a little airborne.

315
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,169
It's still good.
It's still good.

316
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,673
-It's gone.
-I know.

317
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,915
You know, Smithers,
I think I'll donate

318
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,387
a million dollars
to the local orphanage...

319
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,599
when pigs fly.

320
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,388
(both laughing)

321
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,562
That's a good one.

322
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,767
Will you be donating that
million dollars now, sir?

323
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,982
No, I'd still prefer not.

324
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,525
Give it up, Dad--
Piggy ain't coming back.

325
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,576
Lisa, you ruined
my barbecue.

326
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,909
I demand you apologize
this second.

327
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,704
I'm never ever apologizing

328
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,538
because I was standing up
for a just cause

329
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,713
and you were wrong,
wrong, wrong!

330
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,672
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to my room.

331
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,923
That's it!
Go to your room!

332
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,837
Marge, since I'm not
talking to Lisa,

333
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,506
would you please ask her
to pass me the syrup?

334
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,215
Please pass your father
the syrup, Lisa.

335
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,886
Bart, tell Dad I'll
only pass the syrup

336
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,726
if it won't be used
on any meat product.

337
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,192
You dunking your sausages
in that syrup, homeboy?

338
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,521
Marge, tell Bart
I just want to drink

339
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,687
a nice glass of syrup
like I do every morning.

340
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:26,856
Tell him yourself.

341
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,744
You're ignoring Lisa,
not Bart.

342
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,741
Bart, thank your mother
for pointing that out.

343
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,533
Homer, you're not
not talking to me

344
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,326
and secondly, I heard
what you said.

345
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,450
Lisa, tell your mother
to get off my case.

346
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,327
Dad, Lisa's the one
you're not talking to.

347
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,674
Bart, go to your room.

348
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,288
Why don't you
just eat him, Dad?

349
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,335
I don't need any serving
suggestions from you

350
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,340
you barbecue-wrecking,
know-nothing know-it-all.

351
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,632
That's it!

352
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,545
I can't live in a house

353
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,263
with this
prehistoric carnivore!

354
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,143
I am out of here!

355
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,808
That's it!
Go to your room!

356
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,853
Look, it's Mrs. Potato head.

357
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,267
She has a head
made out of lettuce.

358
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,066
(both laughing)

359
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,530
I can't believe I used
to go out with you.

360
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,650
Are you gonna marry
a carrot, Lisa?

361
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,988
Yes, I'm gonna
marry a carrot.

362
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,414
She admitted it.

363
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,372
She admitted she's gonna
marry a carrot.

364
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,043
I can't believe it.

365
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,721
<i>...your windows.</i>

366
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,715
<i>Mmm! The next--</i>

367
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,017
The whole world wants me
to eat meat.

368
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,645
I can't fight it anymore.

369
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,196
(gasping)

370
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,249
(gulps)

371
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,829
There!
Is everybody happy now?!

372
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,665
I take it from you're yelling
that you like my tofu dogs.

373
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,671
-Tofu?
-Oh, yes.

374
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,003
No meat whatsoever,

375
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,008
and only thrice the fat
of a normal hot dog.

376
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,300
I made the switch
and nobody noticed.

377
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,513
But why, Apu?

378
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,053
Because I'm a vegetarian.

379
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,006
Haven't you ever seen
my T-shirt?

380
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,725
That's cute.

381
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,019
Here, let me show you
something, Lisa.

382
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,361
Wow. A secret staircase.

383
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,202
But what do you do if somebody
wants a non-alcoholic beer?

384
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,198
You know,
it's never come up.

385
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,294
LISA:
Oh, Apu, it's beautiful.

386
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,962
Yes, this is where I come

387
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,580
when I need some refuge
from the modern world

388
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:50,497
or when I want to see
drive-in movies for free.

389
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:53,377
I know it is not easy to be
a vegetarian, Lisa.

390
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,045
{\an8}That's why I ran away
from home.

391
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,724
What? She's leaving home?

392
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,600
Wow. Paul McCartney.

393
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,601
I read about you
in history class

394
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,933
but where's your wife,
Linda?

395
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,227
Right here, Lisa.

396
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,940
Whenever we're in Springfield,

397
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,980
we like to hang out in Apu's
garden in the shade.

398
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,904
We met him in India years ago,

399
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,363
during the Maharishi days.

400
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,032
Back then, I was
known as the fifth Beatle.

401
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,532
Sure you were, Apu.

402
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,663
You know what, Lisa?

403
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,909
Paul and Linda
are vegetarians too.

404
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,292
In fact, Linda has her own
line of vegetarian entrees.

405
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,120
{\an8}Apu, I'm sure the last thing
they want to talk about is--

406
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,416
We weren't satisfied
with the other

407
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,169
vegetarian meals
on the market.

408
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,631
You'd be surprised how often

409
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,631
you'd find a big hunk
of pork in them.

410
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,673
Ew.

411
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:34,795
Linda and I both
feel strongly

412
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,512
about animal rights.

413
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,722
In fact, if you play
"Maybe I'm Amazed" backwards,

414
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,803
you'll hear a recipe

415
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,718
for a really ripping
lentil soup.

416
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,466
When will
all those fools learn

417
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,188
that you can be
perfectly healthy

418
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,268
simply eating vegetables,
fruits, grains, and cheese?

419
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,984
Ooh! Cheese.

420
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,034
You don't eat cheese, Apu?

421
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,858
No, I don't eat any food
that comes from an animal.

422
00:19:56,945 --> 00:20:00,485
{\an8}Oh, then you must
think I'm a monster.

423
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,204
Yes, indeed,
I do think that.

424
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,454
But I learned long ago, Lisa,

425
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,746
to tolerate others

426
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,579
rather than forcing
my beliefs on them.

427
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,044
You know, you can
influence people

428
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,544
without badgering them
always.

429
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,376
It's like Paul's song,
"Live and Let Live."

430
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,052
Actually, it was
"Live and Let Die."

431
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,300
Whatever, whatever,
it had a good rhythm.

432
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,642
I guess I have been pretty hard
on a lot of people,

433
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,718
especially my dad.

434
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,763
Thanks, you guys.

435
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,386
Lisa, before you go,

436
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,813
would you
like to hear a song?

437
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,561
Wow! That'd be great!

438
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,563
Okay. Take it, Apu.

Lisa! Come back before
everyone finds out

444
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,960
what a horrible father I am.

445
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,173
Hi, Dad. Looking for me?

446
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,884
I don't know.
Are you looking for me?

447
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,474
I don't know.

448
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,428
Oh, Lisa...
I was looking for you.

449
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,430
I wanted to apologize.

450
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,312
I don't know exactly
what went wrong

451
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,889
but I know
it's always my fault.

452
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,434
Actually, Dad, this time,
I was wrong...

453

454
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,188
-Too.
-Oh.

455
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,600
{\an8}While I was gone, I got
some really good advice

456
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,108
{\an8}from Paul
and Linda McCartney.

457
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,439
Rock stars-- Is there
anything they don't know?

458
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,696
{\an8}I still stand
by my beliefs

459
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,238
{\an8}but I can't defend
what I did.

460
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,702
I'm sorry
I messed up your barbecue.

461
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,793
I understand, honey.

462
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,118
I used to believe in things
when I was a kid.

463
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,330
Come on, I'll give you
a piggyback ride--
