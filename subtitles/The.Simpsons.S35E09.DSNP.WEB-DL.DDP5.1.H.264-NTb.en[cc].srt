Well, don't you worry.

Okay, but this time I'm telling the truth.

00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,526
I did not destroy that doll.

170
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,445
Oh, my God. I believe you.

171
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,615
- [crowd chattering]
- [gasps]

172
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,702
The only way to clear Bart's name
is to figure out who really did it.

173
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,372
But I can't do it all
by myself. I need help.

174
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,208
I'll help you. No, hang on.
Let me try that again.

175
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,709
[louder] I'll help you.

176
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,794
Nailed it.

177
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,547
Taika Waititi? Seriously?

178
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,715
You'll help me exonerate my brother?

179
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,592
Of course. Why? I'll tell you.

180
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:16,388
Because I have a medical condition where
I have to be multitasking at all times.

181
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,892
Well, my brother can't be the only person
on this ship who hated Comic Book Guy.

182
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:24,854
So I guess we'll just have to question
every passenger on the manifest.

183
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,357
Why don't we start
with fans of the Taika-verse?

184
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,858
Whoops! That's everyone.

185
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,194
[laughing]

186
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,279
Let's go.

187
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,031
I hate Comic Book Guy,
and I hated that doll

188
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,617
because it originally belonged to me!

189
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,744
[gasps]

190
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,623
[gasps]

191
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,209
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

192
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,212
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh!

193
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:53,091
Hi. Excuse me,
but I will take this, uh, non-priceless,

194
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:59,306
completely valueless garbage
off of your hands for, uh, $11.

195
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:03,268
But, Dad, I think
it might be worth a lot more.

196
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,769
Who cares, Milhouse?

197
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,023
This is two $5 footlongs
and a weird cookie.

198
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,986
Hey, Luann. Anniversary dinner
is back on, baby.

199
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:17,449
I didn't destroy that action figure,
but I sure had a motive.

200
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,702
A clear motive.

201
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,079
I don't know why you're interrogating me.

202
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,083
I have no bone to grind
with that Comic Book chap.

203
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,168
Really?

204
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,379
Even after Comic Book Guy
led an online troll army

205
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,924
to demand you be fired
and replaced in this?

206
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,344
[narrator] <i>From the producers of</i> Mad Max

207
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:41,932
<i>comes a vision so dark,
so violent and so wacky.</i>

208
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,601
<i>Sideshow Mel...</i>

209
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:49,314
We'll kill them all,
or my name isn't Dick Dastardly.

210
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,693
<i>...and Timothée Chalamet as Muttley.</i>

211
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,698
Curse that funny-book fiend.

212
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,909
He mobilized both the Hanna-Barbarians

213
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,081
and the Wack-olytes against me
in a devastating online petition.

214
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,957
[Lisa gasps]

215
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,379
First of all, that looks so good,
I'm surprised I didn't direct it.

216
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,798
Did I? October was crazy.

217
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,842
But, Mel, would your bone-trembling
anger lead you

218
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:21,346
to destroy Comic Book Guy's
most prized possession?

219
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,472
It would!

220
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,640
But it didn't.

221
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,724
But it could!

222
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:28,353
And if I did,
I would lie about it to you now!

223
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,646
But I'm not.

224
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,273
But I would!

225
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,361
Why are you wasting your time with me?

226
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:41,449
I love my greasy snowman husband and
his tragic blooper of an action figure.

227
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,453
We have security footage
that says differently.

228
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:54,045
[gasps] It's true.
I hated that injection-molded monstrosity.

229
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:58,383
When I first met Comic Book Guy,
I was his priceless collectible.

230
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,135
But now when we make love,

231
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,263
my husband calls out
the doll's serial number.

232
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:07,435
I just want back
my sweet Comic Book Gaijin.

233
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,316
So many passengers
could have committed doll-icide.

234
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,901
Huh.

235
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,865
Poor Bart. Ah, but, geez,
look at the mess he left in our cabin.

236
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,909
[gasps]

237
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,329
Oh, dear God.

238
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,372
I didn't think Bart did it,

239
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:34,169
but then I found this Radioactive head
from the decapitated doll in Bart's stuff.

240
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,631
He looked me right in the eyes
and said he didn't do it.

241
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,342
I can never trust him again. [cries]

242
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,513
Oh, sweetie. You've just learned one
of life's hardest lessons.

243
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,391
Sometimes, no matter how much
you love someone,

244
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,769
they're just going to let you down.

245
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,562
For your mother, it's me.

246
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,689
Just try to get some sleep, honey.

247
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,652
Bart will still be horribly guilty
in the morning.

248
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,116
- [sighs] Hmm?
- [knocking on door]

249
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,203
Rainier Wolfcastle?

250
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,539
There is something I must tell you
about the night of the "fanquet"

251
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,458
and subsequent toy murder.

252
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,462
When everything went dark,
I was wearing my night-vision goggles

253
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,048
from my upcoming film,
<i>The Night-Vision Goggler</i>.

254
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,883
[gasps] Did you see who did it?

255
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,343
Patience, <i>Fräulein.</i>

256
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:29,098
I did see the culprit, and I'm about
to tell you who he or she is.

257
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:32,060
Watch as the words emerge from my mouth.

258
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,523
The doll murderer is "<i>nein</i>" other than...

259
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,023
Ouch.

260
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,610
I will be passing out now
and all of these things.

261
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,153
[groans]

262
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,239
[Lisa gasps] Oh!

263
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,207
[groans] Damn it.

264
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,920
Ugh.

265
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,634
Lisa, are you also up dusting for prints?

266
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,638
That's what I call eating leftover food
off people's room service trays.

267
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,517
I don't care!

268
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:17,313
If one more horrible thing happens,
I'm going to lose it.

269
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,481
[person screams]

270
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:23,028
My sweet Comic Book Guy is gone.

271
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,697
Of course he is.

272
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,909
[inhales] I mean... [screams]

273
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:35,498
Bart's in jail, our one credible witness
just got sucker-shielded,

274
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,958
Comic Book Guy is missing,

275
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,335
and we're still no closer
to solving the case.

276
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,962
So many twists and turns.

277
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,006
What kind of murder mystery is this?

278
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,384
Stop talking, Taika Waititi!

279
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:50,305
That's it. I know who murdered the toy,
but I just need one thing.

280
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,766
An audience
to watch me milk the big reveal.

281
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,644
The murder
of Comic Book Guy's action figure

282
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:00,023
was committed by Comic Book Guy himself.

283
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,358
Based on a hunch,
I wrote to Lloyd's of London,

284
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,778
and I got this response
from Lloyd himself. Good guy.

285
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:11,618
Comic Book Guy had the doll appraised
and insured for 935,000 British pounds.

286
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,202
[crowd gasps]

287
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,621
So he turned off the lights

288
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,625
and murdered the plastic action man
himself for the insurance money.

289
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,710
But then he knew that we were onto him.

290
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,837
Or, let's face it, I was onto him.

291
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,672
So, he took flight in the dead of night,

292
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,008
but not before planting the doll's head
in Bart's cabin

293
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,010
and knocking out the one witness
to the crime,

294
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,804
washed-up action star Rainier Wolfcastle.

295
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,891
That's fair. [groans, exhales]

296
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,894
Now Comic Book Guy's probably
on a tropical beach somewhere,

297
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:38,978
sipping mai tais.

298
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:43,816
Little does he know that his heinous crime
has been exposed by me,

299
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,901
master sleuth,

300
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:51,157
and star of the upcoming reboot
"Kiwi's Big Adventure," Taika Waititi.

301
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,575
[crowd cheers]

302
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,037
Wow. He really did it.

303
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,002
Oh, my God.
How could I have been so stupid?

304
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,755
Amazing work, Taika Waititi.

305
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:10,009
I know you just cracked the case,
but I have a little theory of my own.

306
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,761
Does anyone wanna hear it?

307
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,887
[crowd] No.

308
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,890
Oh, come on, people. What's the harm?

309
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,724
Thank you, Taika.

310
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:22,063
Now, as you recall, there were only two
of these irregular Radioactive Man dolls

311
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,190
made in the whole world.

312
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,567
Oh, I remember.

313
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:30,029
What if the owner of the other doll
received some bad news

314
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,699
<i>and broke their action figure
in a fit of rage?</i>

315
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,536
<i>And then what if that owner came
on this cruise specifically</i>

316
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,289
<i>to swap out their broken figure
for Comic Book Guy's intact one,</i>

317
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,126
<i>so that they could secretly
possess the only Radioactive Man</i>

318
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,545
<i>with Wolverine claws left in existence?</i>

319
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,923
And I just discovered something
quite interesting,

320
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:53,678
thanks to the ship's onboard Wi-Fi,
which is spotty at best.

321
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,138
[all] Mmm.

322
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,973
According to this website,

323
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,727
that second doll was sold in Wellington,
New Zealand,

324
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:04,063
{\an8}where they spell color with a U.

325
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:08,193
{\an8}Now, who on this boat do we know comes
from New Zealand?

326
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,486
{\an8}Well, that's a very clever theory.

327
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,405
{\an8}But if it's a crime
to be from New Zealand,

328
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,658
{\an8}you'd have to arrest both guys
from Flight of the Conchords.

329
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,994
{\an8}What are their names again?
Fred and Jimothy.

330
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,287
[crowd murmurs]

331
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,496
You might be right.

332
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,081
But consider that the shield,

333
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,084
that incapacitated the only witness
to the crime,

334
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,879
seems to be covered with goo.

335
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,174
What manner of goo?

336
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:35,845
Dad, I know this is a weird ask,
but would you mind licking this... Oh.

337
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,265
Ugh. Ew. Salty.

338
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,058
Yeasty.

339
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,770
Ugh, with hints of malty grossness.

340
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,521
Vegemite.

341
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:48,399
The favorite food of Taika Waititi.

342
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,737
Or should I say "fav-our-ite"?

343
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,947
[crowd murmuring]

344
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:58,493
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about
the scratch marks on Bart Simpson's face?

345
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,120
Those had to come
from the tiny claws on the doll he broke.

346
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:05,291
{\an8}Did they?
Or maybe they came from this seafood fork.

347
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:09,295
<i>My dad was selfishly shoveling pre-shucked
shellfish down his shrimp shaft...</i>

348
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,463
<i>one take...</i> [chuckles]

349
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,509
<i>...and he accidentally
scratched Bart on his cheek.</i>

350
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,970
That silver-haired,
multi-hyphenate is guilty as sin.

351
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:22,309
{\an8}[chuckles] Not without one more piece
of damning evidence, I'm not.

352
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,811
You can't just tear my cabin apart.

353
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,145
You need a warrant.

354
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,649
No, we don't.
We're in international waters.

355
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,651
We're in the middle of Lake Springfield.

356
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,070
I can see the Lard Lad statue from here.

357
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:38,074
Here it is.
Comic Book Guy's original doll, unbroken.

358
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,409
Damn it. Yes, it's true, Lenny.

359
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,494
I did it.

360
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,288
I threw my New Zealand Radioactive Man
across the room

361
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,917
when I found out the streamer was
shelving the second season of my series

362
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,001
without airing it!

363
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,837
For tax purposes?

364
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,338
Yes, for tax purposes!

365
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,133
So I hatched this plan,
because I needed the money

366
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,637
to throw into my already
enormous pile of money.

367
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,973
You haven't seen the last of me!

368
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,392
I've got powerful friends in New Zealand.

369
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:09,063
Hobbits, Orcs, Lorde,
Ents, Melanie Lynskey.

370
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,606
The "How Bizarre" guy.

371
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,483
We are a powerful nation.

372
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,902
[screams] Ow! Ow!

373
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:19,365
Lisa, your explanation was comprehensive
and utterly persuasive.

374
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:23,202
But as I was headed to get an orange soda
from the refrigerator,

375
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:26,622
one nagging problem did occur to me.
You see...

376
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,083
Oh, no.
Don't you dare start pulling threads.

377
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,210
That's not how mysteries work.

378
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,754
Once a smart character
like Sherlock Holmes or Lisa

379
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,632
does a super long explanation
of all the stuff you didn't notice

380
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:40,219
because you're dumb,
you just believe it and move on.

381
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,388
[crowd cheers]

382
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,807
There is one thing I can't figure out.

383
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,434
What happened to Comic Book Guy?

384
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,895
I mean, we looked everywhere.

385
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:52,107
[gasps] Except the one place
he would never go.

386
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,987
Oh, my sarcastic darling.

387
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,530
What happened to you?

388
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,073
Permit me to explain.

389
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,493
[Homer groans] More explaining?

390
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:07,705
[Comic Book Guy] <i>When Lisa and
Taika Waititi began questioning suspects,</i>

391
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,540
<i>I set up a surveillance device,</i>

392
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,461
<i>because I wanted to mock
their inept methods of interrogation.</i>

393
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,796
<i>I hate Comic Book Guy.</i>

394
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,798
<i>But then again, so does everyone.</i>

395
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,427
<i>He smells like baked beans
that have been left out in the sun.</i>

396
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,221
<i>I loathe his voice.</i>

397
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,557
<i>Who speaks
with such exaggerated affectation?</i>

398
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,560
[Comic Book Guy] <i>No one should ever hear
what people actually think of them.</i>

399
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,439
Apparently, I am not a beloved
quirky character like Kramer.

400
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,235
Instead, I am widely reviled
like the guy who played Kramer.

401
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:42,908
So I hid here surrounded only by shame
and whatever these metal things are.

402
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,160
- [Marge] Mmm.
- [Bart grunts]

403
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,955
I don't wanna get all sincere and emo,
but thanks, Lisa.

404
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,581
{\an8}You never lost faith in me.

405
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,669
Well, if I'm being totally honest...

406
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,421
I never did.

407
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:04,304
<i>I just want back
my sweet Comic Book Gaijin.</i>

408
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:10,059
Once again,
a critical lesson is learned via hologram.

409
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,688
I have been a fool.

410
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,170
Best husband ever.

411
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,342
[both moaning]

412
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,947
[car squeaking]

413
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,914
[groaning]

414
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,669
Get out of there and come to bed.

415
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,714
I'll never let go.

416
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,384
Shh!
