12
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,962
{\an8}I want a colossal donut

{\an8}Sorry, sir.
No refunds.

17
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,345
{\an8}I paid for a colossal donut,

18
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:00,561

00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,571

BART:
What are you waiting for?

68
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,464
Wreck the school.

00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,083
-Hmm.
-I agree.

71
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,126

uh, Flanders has it.

78
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,808
Just smash open his house.

79
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,681
He came to life.

80
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,388

Flanders has it.

86
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,164
Or Moe. Go kill Moe.

87
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,292
-(tires screeching)
-Homer, just give him the donut.

88
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,620
Once he has it, that'll be
the end of all this horror.

89
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,575
Well... okay.

90
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,076

all the time?

95
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,684
Sometimes.

(Godzilla-like roar)

97
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,821
These monsters
are destroying

98
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,986
everything and everyone
we hold dear...

99
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,195
and you kids should
have jackets on.

100
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,746
Hey, what's that
in his footprint?

101
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,084
{\an8}Hmm.

102
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,037
If your advertising agency

103
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,748
created all those
giant characters,

104
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,258
you must know
how to stop them.

105
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,879
Well, sir, advertising
is a funny thing.

106
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,467
If people stop
paying attention to it,

107
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,353
pretty soon,
it goes away.

108
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,220
Like that old woman
who couldn't find the beef?

109
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,557
Exactly.

110
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,311
If you stop paying attention
to the monsters,

111
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,983
they'll lose their powers.

112
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,191
But people can't help
looking at them.

113
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,401
They're wrecking
the town.

{\an8}We're newlyweds on our way

D'oh. Shazbot!

<i>Even as I speak,</i>

Bart! Is that you?

-Yes.
-Take out the garbage.

166
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,423
And then he raked me
across the chest.

167
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,217
And the weirdest thing was

168
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,221
it was that school janitor
who mysteriously disappeared,

169
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,564
Groundskeeper Willie.

170
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,268
Oh, my God, Bart,

171
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,308
Groundskeeper Willie
was in my nightmare, too,

172
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,732
but he got me
with hedge clippers.

173
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,192
He ran his floor buffer over me.

174
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,994
(chuckling) Children, I couldn't help
monitoring your conversation.

175
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,358
There's no mystery
about Willie.

176
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,236
Why, he simply disappeared.

177
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,373
Now, let's have
no more curiosity

178
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,080
about this bizarre cover-up.

179
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,541
Remember, class, the worse you do
on this standardized test,

180
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,922
the more funding
the school gets.

181
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,328
So don't knock yourselves out.

182
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,706
You have three hours to--

183
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,752
-Finished!
-Ugh.

184
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,376
Then put your head down
on your desk and sit quietly.

185
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,884
Ah... a duet of pleasures.

186
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,303
I am the wondrous wizard
of Latin!

187
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,767
I am a dervish of declension
and a conjuror of conjugation

188
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,809
with a million hit points
and maximum charisma!

189
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,694
Ha ha! Morire: to die.

190
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,862
Morit: he, she or it dies!

191
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,356
Moris: you die.

192
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,485
(screams)

193
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,281
(chortling)

194
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,985
You've mastered a dead tongue,
but can you handle a live one?

195
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,828
(choking)

196
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,036
(yelps)

197
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,625
(shrieks)

198
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,711
Ha ha!

199
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,588
Wheel him out quietly.

200
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,545
It's best the children
don't see him.

201
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,928
(all screaming)

202
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:17,602
Oh, just get it out of here.

203
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,062
Not into the kindergarten.

204
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,731
(high-pitched screams)

205
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,060
Mom, Dad!

206
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,194
Martin died
at school today.

207
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,772
Ooh.... I don't see
what that has to do

208
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,187
with Groundskeeper Willie.

209
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,066
Um...

210
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:33,072
We didn't mention
Groundskeeper Willie, Mom.

211
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,775
Mm...

212
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,985
Kids, it's time we told you
the true story

213
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,076
and put your fears to rest.

214
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,661
It's a story of murder
and revenge

215
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,997
from beyond the grave.

216
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,293

223
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,562
Good advice.

228
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,693
Our next budget item:

Please help me!

Willie, please.

239
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,299
Mr. Van Houten
has the floor.

240
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,919
I for one
would like to see

241
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,756
the cafeteria menus
in advance

242
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,391
so parents can adjust their
dinner menus accordingly.

243
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,599
I don't like the idea
of Milhouse having

244
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,849
two spaghetti meals
in one day.

245
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:46,311
-(fire roaring)
-(anguished screaming)

246
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:50,855
You'll pay for this,
with your children's blood!

247
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,941
Oh, right. How you going to
get them? "Skeleton power"?

248
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:58,118
I'll strike where you
cannot protect them:

249
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,949
in their dreams.

250
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,707
Bart, don't you realize
what this means?

251
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,501
The next time we fall asleep,
we could die.

252
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,125
Welcome to my world.

We can't
stay up forever.

261
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,813
You're right.

262
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,976
The only thing left to do
is go into my dream

263
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,435
and force Willie
into a final showdown.

264
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,896
You stay awake.

265
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,395
If it looks like I'm
in trouble, wake me up.

266
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,567
Okay.

267
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,155

grouchy.

Come on, Willie.

270
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,628
I know you're out there.

271
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:57,844

272
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,085

273
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,274
The sandbox.

(grunts)

275
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,027
Hey, lawn boy!

276
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,243
You missed a spot!

277
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,866
When I'm done with you,

278
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,251
they'll have to do
a compost-mortem.

279
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,344
Ach! Sinky sand!

280
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,304
Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh!

283
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,602
Willie's gone for good.

284
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,932
Now I can get back
to my normal dreams.

285
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,728
Me and Krusty
winning the Super Bowl.

286
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:52,732
Bart, there's
two seconds left.

287
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,193
Now, listen up.

288
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,523
It's your basic
Statue of Liberty play

289
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,568
with one twist:
you throw it to me.

290
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,741
Knute Rockne called it
the forward pass.

291
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,860
Now, the clock's still running,
so it's important

292
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,657
we start this play as
quickly as possible.

293
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,951
(screams)

294
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,704
Oh, boy.

295
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,656
Don't dream
about me no more, kid.

296
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,076
Help. Lisa, help!

297
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,075
Bart, you're in trouble!
Wake up!

298
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,826
Wait a minute.

299
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,208
If you're here,
then you've fallen asleep too.

300
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,335
I'm not asleep.

301
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,461
I'm just resting my eye...

302
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,047
Uh-oh.

303
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,796
Good-bye, Bart.

304
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,137
Good-bye, Lise.

305
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,932
Hope you get
reincarnated as someone

306
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,555
who can stay awake
for 15 minutes.

307
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,348
(gasps)

308
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,784
(screams)

309
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,289
You saved us, Maggie.

310
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,750
I don't know, Bart.

311
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,746
Something tells me
Willie's still out there

312
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,378
and that he could come back
any time in any form

313
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,625
and kill us in ways
we can't even imagine.

314
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,394
Boo!

315
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,522
Ohh! Aah! Eeh!

316
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,520

318
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,346
Oh!

319
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,357
Stop!

320
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,268
I left my gun on the seat!

321
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,277
Hey!

322
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,278
(panting and gasping)

323
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,859
Wait here, please.

324
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,533
Ah, jeez.

325
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,985

00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,115
MARGE:
Homer, get ready.

327
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,037
Patty and Selma
will be here any minute.

328
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,086
D'oh. Oh, no.

329
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,749
Better ride this one
out in the closet.

330
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,628
Sorry, Dad.
This is our spot.

331
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,966
Oh, yeah? Well, it's my house,
so it's my spot.

332
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,602
Na-aw. Cause we
called it.

333
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,179
-Did not.
-Well, we're calling it now.

334
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,564
-You are?
-'Fraid so.

335
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,520
They got me with
legal mumbo-jumbo.

336
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,185
-(growling)
-(doorbell rings)

337
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,065
MARGE:
Just a second!

338
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,782
Doo-ooh.

339
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,452
Huh?

340
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,200
I never looked behind this
what-cha-ma-call-it case before.

341
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,043
(laughing)

342
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,158
Huh? That's weird.

343
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:17,165
It's like something out of that
twilighty show about that zone.

344
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,004
How's it hanging, Marge?

345
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,455
Uck, I'm baking like a meat loaf
under this wet wool.

346
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,087
Uh, may I take
your coat, Aunt Selma?

347
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,257
Um, I would also like
to take your coat.

348
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,890
Have we got a family
activity for you.

349
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,806
A pillowcase full of seashells
from our trip to Sulfur Bay.

350
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,476
You're going to help us
clean and organize them.

351
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,274
And pry out all the
dead hermit crabs.

352
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,028
Get a screwdriver.

353
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,529
(squeals)

354
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,911
I'll take my chances
in the mystery wall.

355

00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,924
<i>Oh, heavenly testament</i>
<i>to the eternal majesty</i>

357
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,963
<i>of God's creation.</i>

358
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,087
Holy macaroni!

359
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,295
(hawking)

360
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,467
Hey. You can
just suck them out.

361
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,055
HOMER (reverberating voice):
<i>Hello?</i>

362
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,520
<i>Can anybody hear me?</i>

363
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,440
Homer, where are you?

364
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,479
<i>Uh, I'm somewhere,</i>
<i>where I don't know where I am.</i>

365
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,773
Do you see towels?

366
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,436
If you see towels,

367
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,985
you're probably
in the linen closet again.

368
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,198
<i>Just a second.</i>

369
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,408
<i>No. It's a place</i>
<i>I've never been before.</i>

370
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,490
Ah, the shower.

371
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,084
(laughing)

372
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,329
<i>Hey!</i>

373
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,671
I don't want to alarm you,
Marge,

374
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,514
<i>but I seem to be</i>
<i>trapped in here.</i>

375
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,970
We better call Ned.

376
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,300
He has a ladder.

377
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,295
What's going on here?

378
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:57,137
I'm so bulgy.

379
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,354
My stomach sticks way out
in front and my...

380
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,845
(screams)

381
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,936
Well, as the tree said
to the lumberjack,

382
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,903
I'm stumped.

383
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,533
It's like he just
disappeared into fat air.

384
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,110
(laughing)

385
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,985
Hey, shut up!

386
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,247
Mmm...

387
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,375
unprocessed fish sticks.

388
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,805
Man,

389
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,603
this place looks expensive.

390
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:46,266
I feel like I'm wasting
a fortune just standing here.

391
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,186
(humming)

392
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,736
Better make the most of it.

393
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,449
(burps)

394
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,992
Ow!

395
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,374
Watch it, coney!

396
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,661
(grunts)

397
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,365
(whistling sound)

398
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,535
Oops.

399
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,373
Do you see
a light, Homer?

400
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,998
<i>Yes.</i>

401
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,745
Move into the light,
my son.

402
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:08,746
(sizzling noise)

403
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:09,917
<i>Ow!</i>

404
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,465
Homer, this is
your physician

405
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,008
Dr. Julius Hibbert.

406
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,222
Can you tell us what
it's like in there?

407
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,312
Um... it's like, uh...

408
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,018
Did anyone see the
movie "Tron"?

409
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,020
-No.
-No.

410
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,271
-No.
-No.

411
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,602
-No.
-No.

412
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,766
-No.
-No.

413
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:26,774
Yes.

414
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,145
I mean, no. No.

415
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,855
Well, where's my Dad?

416
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,065
Well, it
should be obvious

417
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,284
to even the most
dimwitted individual

418
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,695
who holds an advanced degree
in hyperbolic topology

419
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,825
that Homer Simpson
has stumbled into...

420
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,373
the third dimension.

421
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,627
Sorry.

422
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,461
Here is an ordinary square.

423
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,047
Whoa, whoa,
slow down, egghead.

424
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,433
But suppose we
extend the square

425
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,640
beyond the two dimensions
of our universe

426
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,640
along the hypothetical
"z" axis there.

427
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,313
(all gasping)

428
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,312
This forms a three-dimensional
object known as a cube

429
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,265
or a frinkahedron in honor
of its discoverer.

430
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,646
Hoo-hey, hoo-hey.

431
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,362
<i>Help me!</i>

432
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,032
<i>Are you helping me</i>
<i>or are you going on and on?</i>

433
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,861
Oh, right.

434
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,486
And of course, within, we find
the doomed individual.

435
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,914
Enough of your borax,
Poindexter!

436
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,992
A man's life is at stake.

437
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,236
We need action.

438
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,173
Take that
you lousy dimension!

439
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,459
Huh? Huh?

440
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,459
Ah!

441
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,300
Oh, there's so much I don't know
about astrophysics.

442
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,175
I wish I read that book
by that wheelchair guy.

443
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,183
(screaming)

444
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,443
(whimpering)

445
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,025
I'll save Homer.

446
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,610
All I needs is four stout men
to work the bellows.

447
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,157
No, pops. It's too risky.

448
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,370
For all we know,
there could be cubes in there

449
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,161
the size of gorillas
and other large...

450
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:07,084
<i>Help! I don't have much time!</i>

451
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,674
That does it.
I'm going in.

452
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,630
Bart, no!

453
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,884
Cool, man.

454
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,144
Oh, my God, I'm going
to be sucked into a black hole.

455
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,023
I'm going to be sucked
into oblivion.

456
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,059
I'm going to be nothing.
And what's gonna be

457
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,442
coming out the other side,
I don't know.

458
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,849
I'll save you, Dad.

459
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,573
Oh, I can't get any closer.

460
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,361
You'll have to jump.

461
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,158
Piece of cake, son.

462
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,252
Crap, crap, crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap, crap

463
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,498
crap, crap, crap, crap...

464
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,170
(screaming)

465
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,841
Bart, what happened?

466
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,683
Well, we hit a little snag

467
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,338
when the universe sort
of collapsed on itself

468
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,596
but Dad seemed
cautiously optimistic.

469
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,809
<i>Craaaap!</i>

470
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,930
Homie.

471
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,137
Be strong, Marge.

472
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,477
I'm sure he's gone

473
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,901
to a better place.

474
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,770
(sizzling noise)

475
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,396
(Homer screaming)

476
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,153
D'oh!

477
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,606
Eww, this is
the worst place yet.

478
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,870
Oh.

479
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,621
Oh, my God, look at this.

480
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,583
(whimpering)

481
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,054
Ooh, erotic cakes.
