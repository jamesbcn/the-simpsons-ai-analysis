Now Sideshow Bob can't get in
without me knowing.

180
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,415
And once a man is
in your home,

181
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,379
anything you do to him
is nice and legal.

182
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,170
Is that so?
Oh, Flanders?

183
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,715
Won't you join me in my kitchen?

184
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,880
(sinister laughing)

185
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,217
(door opens)

186
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,552
Uh, doesn't work
if you invite 'em.

187
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,638
Hi-dily hey!

188
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,432
-Go home.
-Toodle-ly doo.

189
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,476
Now, don't you fret.
When I'm through,

190
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,310
he won't set foot
in this town again.

191
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,897
I can be very,
very persuasive.

192
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,402
(gun cocks)

193
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,284
(siren wails in distance)

194
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,661
-Come on. Leave town.
-No.

195
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,658
I'll be your friend.

196
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,580
-No.
-Oh, you're mean.

197
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,079
The following
neighborhood residents

198
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,751
will not be killed by me--

199
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:47,751
Ned Flanders,

200
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,502
<i>Maude Flanders.</i>

201
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,963
Oh, isn't that nice?

202
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,503
Homer Simpson,

203
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,956

<i>That is all.</i>

207
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,466
Woo-hoo!
Did you hear, Bart?

208
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:02,889
Oh.

209
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,602
Don't worry, Mrs. Simpson.

210
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,937
We've helped hundreds
of people in danger.

211
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,731
We'll give you
a new name,

212
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,895
a new job,
new identities.

213
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,693
Whoo! I want to be John Elway.

214
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,566
(crowd cheers)

215
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,613
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Elway takes the snap</i>

216
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,487

217
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,664

<i>Denver 7, San Francisco, 56.</i>

220
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,843
-Woo-hoo!
-I don't think this is such a good idea.

221
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,669
This isn't just
because of Sideshow Bob.

222
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,176
It's a chance to turn around
all our stinking lives.

223
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,008
I'll be Gus,
the loveable chimney sweep.

224
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,854
Clean as a whistle, sharp as a thistle.
Best in all Westminster. Yeah!

225
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,561
-Shut up, boy.
-We have places

226
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,771
your family can hide

227
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:54,152
Cape Fear, Terror Lake,
New Horror Field, Screamville.

228
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,321
Ooh! Ice Creamville.

229
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,649
-No. Screamville.
-(shrieks)

230
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,525
Tell you what, sir.

231
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,452
From now on, you'll be
Homer Thompson at Terror Lake.

232
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,491
Let's just practice
a bit, hmm?

233
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,945
When I say,
"Hello, Mr. Thompson,"

234
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,576
-you'll say, "Hi."
-Check.

235
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,462
Hello, Mr. Thompson.

236
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,880
Remember now,
your name is Homer Thompson.

237
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,050
-I got ya.
-Hello, Mr. Thompson.

238

(groaning)

239
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,717
Now, when I say,
"Hello, Mr. Thompson"

240
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,725
and press down on your foot,
you smile and nod.

241
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,519
-No problem.
-Hello, Mr. Thompson.

242
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,477
I think he's talking to you.

243
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,279
-Here you go.
-Oh, what a cute convertible.

244

-Nah.
-No, go on.

359
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,118
Well, you have such
a beautiful voice.

360
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,076
Guilty as charged.

361
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,127
Uh-huh. Anyway, I was wondering
if you could sing

362
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,011
the entire score
of the <i>H.M.S. Pinafore.</i>

363
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,799
Very well, Bart.

364
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:39,553
I shall send you to heaven
before I send you to hell.

365
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,141
And a-two and a-three and...

<i>♪ An Englishman ♪</i>

382
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,826
And now, the final curtain.

383
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,506
(guns cocking)

384
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,879
Hold it right there,
Sideshow Bob.

385
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:00,967
You're under arrest.

386
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,551
By Lucifer's beard!

387
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:07,557
Uh, yeah. It's a good thing
you drifted by this brothel.

388
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,560
I knew I had to buy some time.
So I asked him

389
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,066
to sing the score
from the <i>H.M.S. Pinafore.</i>

390
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:18,858
Ooh, a plan fiendishly clever
in its in-tric-acies.

391
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,454
Take him away, boys.

392
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,109
Hey, I'm the chief here.

393
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,817
Bake him away, toys.

394
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:24,987
What did you say, Chief?

395
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,485
Do what the kid says.

396
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:33,038
Hmm. It's so good
to be home again.

397
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,835
Look what happened
without my pills!

398
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,459
(gasping)

399
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,126
Bart, run upstairs,
get Grampa's medicine.

400
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:45,425
Not so fast. I want to court
this fair young maiden.

401
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,642
GRAMPA: <i>There's something</i>
<i>you should know about me.</i>

402
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,893
JASPER: <i>I've got Steve</i>
<i>and Eydie tickets.</i>

403
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,265
<i>I'm all yours!</i>

404
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,481
<i>(kissing sound)</i>
