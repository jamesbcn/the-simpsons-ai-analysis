1
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,611
Hey there, chief.

2
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,780
Look, your mailbox
hasn't been emptied in weeks.

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,383
Oh, no, not the mail.

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,086
What if I'm missing out
on coupon packs,

5
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:21,288
or perhaps a jury summons?

6
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:25,058
How will I live
without my paper e-mails?

7
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,060
I get it.

8
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,463
But be a pal, pally.
Empty it out.

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,600
It has been baking
in the sun for a while.

10
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,068
I think it's done.

11
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,245
Mail loaf!

12
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,252
Carve that mail.
Carve it good.

13
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,321
Who wants an end piece?

14
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:01,662
I'm invited to a birthday party
at Addy's.

15
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,531
Addy?
I don't know that friend.

16
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,066
What subject does she teach?

17
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:09,102
It's a kid! I know kids.

18
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,071
It's a sleepover
at Addy's house.

19
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:12,806
Addy.

20
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,641
I met her at the library.

21
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,644
Library, Marge.

22
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,113
We were the only ones
who loved this old series

23
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,783
of books, Gallop Girls.

24
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:28,555
Old book smell.

25
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,192
New friend smell.

26
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,667
What is the deal
with girls and horses?

27
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:43,170
Is it 'cause boys took
all the good animals,

28
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,805
like dogs and ninjas?

29
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,107
Horses are nature's triumph.

30
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:49,810
They have the perfect
combination of power,

31
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,112
grace and braidable hair.

32
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:55,649
Dumb, dumb, stupid.
Legs don't move.

33
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,317
Pink?!

34
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,553
Once cars were invented,
why didn't they just

35
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,123
kill all the horses...
with the cars?

36
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,025
Beat it, Summer School.

37
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,561
Horse-a-copter attack.
Its plops are bombs.

38
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:15,435
Let her go. She's a rescue
and uneasy around men.

39
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,073
My paddock!

40
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,177
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
No horseplay.

41
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,246
Horseplay!

42
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,149
Marge, guess what I said.
Fight on.

43
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:32,853
Why? Why do you always wreck
the stuff I care about?

44
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:36,723
Big brothers are supposed
to be helpful and a little nice.

45
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,992
I wish I could un-brother you.

46
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:41,528
Not if I un-sister you first.

47
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:44,665
Fine. By the power
of safety scissors,

48
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:47,868
I hereby sever the sibling bond.

49
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,037
Snip.

50
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,649
Look at that house.

51
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:05,152
I bet they use
their garage for cars.

52
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:09,890
Horsey birthday!

53
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,059
Your house is huge.

54
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,027
Yeah, it's kind of embarrassing.

55
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:16,063
My dad's the exclusive
ketchup distributor

56
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,998
for stadiums and megachurches.

57
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:22,135
She's obviously lying.
Ketchup is free.

58
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,170
Play along.

59
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,571
Hi, I'm Marge.

60
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,173
Lisa's really been
looking forward

61
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,841
to your daughter's party.

62
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,576
Oh, no, I'm the party planner.

63
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,678
The mother's
on a photoshopping retreat

64
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,914
to get her son into USC.

65
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,883
Have fun.
We'll see you tomorrow.

66
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,286
10:00 a.m. pickup.
Goodbyes and gift bags.

67
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,222
They're so rich,
they know the future.

68
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,458
Well, I just finished
the Gallop Girls book

69
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:47,828
where George Washington's horse
exposed Benedict Arnold's horse

70
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,329
as a traitor.

71
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,008
I kind of wanted it
to be a surprise.

72
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,411
We kind of own horses.

73
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:13,086
You know, Lisa has a sleepover,
Grampa's with the other ones,

74
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,088
and we are near the marina.

75
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,157
I'm not looking
for your lost sunglasses.

76
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,659
It's been six years.
They're gone.

77
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,462
You are always saying how
I never make plans for us.

78
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:26,099
Well, how about a sunset cruise?

79
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,268
I only ever read about those

80
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,470
in Sunset Cruise magazine.

81
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,472
There's even live music.

82
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,142
This is the band that was gonna
play Lenny's wedding reception

83
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,344
if he didn't get
pepper-sprayed at the altar.

84
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,513
I forgot how handsome you are

85
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,615
when you make
the slightest effort.

86
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,154
Don't worry.

87
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,023
If you get thrown, your vest
will automatically inflate

88
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,158
so it breaks your fall.

89
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,592
Now use the reins.

90
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,528
Sunflower wants you to lead her.

91
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,802
What's the matter, Addison?
You didn't like my post.

92
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,236
Is your thumb broken?

93
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,605
Thumb broken?

94
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,543
Tessa Rose, you are brills.
Completely brills.

95
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,446
Literally, that was
the funniest thing ever.

96
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,048
I can't stop laughing.

97
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,818
Addison, why is she
staring at us?

98
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,186
Addison?

99
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,355
Is that what you like
to be called?

100
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,725
This is my crew.

101
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,994
You probably know them all
from social.

102
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,397
This is Bella-Ella.
She's from old money.

103
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,832
Myspace.

104
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,266
Sloan. British.

105
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,404
And, of course,
beauty icon Tessa Rose.

106
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,206
Don't you just hate her?

107
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,643
Oh, right, guys,
this is Lisa.

108
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,478
She's... her.

109
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,013
Nice to meet you guys.

110
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,982
You need to calm down.

111
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:50,483
I am calm.

112
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,052
Stop yelling.

113
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,186
I'm not yelling.

114
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,422
Look, matchy-matchy...

115
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,891
I don't need drama
from someone whose shirt

116
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,093
is a spoiler for her pants.

117
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,163
You're hilarious.
I will never stop laughing.

118
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,139
Your friends seem
different than you.

119
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,609
That one keeps saying
things are funny,

120
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,510
but she's not laughing.

121
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,013
Oh, she can't.
Her mom got too much Botox

122
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,214
when she was pregnant.

123
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:22,949
Ugh, so lucky.

124
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:26,086
I know they seem cliquey
and stuck-up and...

125
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,854
- Awful?
- Yeah.

126
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:31,057
But once they accept you,
you'll see that, deep down,

127
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,093
they're... nice.

128
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,096
Oh, good, good.
So they're not mean.

129
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,131
Oh, I almost judged them.

130
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,933
That was close.

131
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:46,907
These will totally hide
my kombucha hangovers.

132
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,541
I got them in the city.

133
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,845
The city is New York.
New York City?

134
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:55,749
I'll make a note, in a book.
A notebook.

135
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:59,219
A phone case.

136
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,587
It's for the new MyPhone.

137
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:02,989
There's no buttons,
and the camera only faces you.

138
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,958
It's literally unusable.

139
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,160
What about my gift?

140
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,366
Look, it's got a little
straw hat

141
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,101
that fits right over his ears.

142
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,204
She got her a toy.

143
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,606
Does it come with a nappy?

144
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,474
Oh, my God,
I'm laughing so hard,

145
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,943
I can't even breathe.

146
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,111
Does it dispense bronzer?
Bronzer remover?

147
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,947
What does it dispense?
How is it makeup?

148
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,581
But you like it,

149
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,050
don't you, Addy?

150
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,585
Oh, it's adorable.

151
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,490
For a widdle baby.

152
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,438
You're breaking up, honey.

153
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,173
How's the party?

154
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,176
It's not fun.
I don't want to stay.

155
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,711
I want to go home.

156
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,446
It's fun.

157
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,581
I don't want to
go home.

158
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,817
Thanks for the uneventful
update.

159
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,085
How's Lisa?

160
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,787
Having fun and not wanting
to go home.

161
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,189
Sounds like fun.

162
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:18,231
You're right.
Daddy understands completely.

163
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,799
That's what daddies do.

164
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:24,604
I'm trapped. All night.

165
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,606
With them.

166
00:08:32,347 --> 00:08:35,782
What do you mean the
Taylor Swift lookalike canceled?

167
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,051
Now who are the girls gonna
throw cupcakes at?

168
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:41,054
Finally.
You're the only adult here.

169
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,056
I want to go home.
Can you help me?

170
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,025
Oh, no, this sleepover
has got to get

171
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,926
100% engagement.

172
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,162
I can't go back to working
at Bubba Gump Shrimp.

173
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,997
It's not shrimp.

174
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,832
Hey, lady bosses,

175
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,401
who wants to visit
the perfume lab

176
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,836
and start your own fempire?

177
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:01,875
What are you wearing,
Desperation by Thirsty Grandma?

178
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,880
I'm 26.

179
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,719
Let's binge the new season
of Thank God I'm Dead.

180
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:16,089
T.G. I'm D.
is literally massive.

181
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:19,125
Leandra's funeral is so
on my vision board.

182
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,094
I'm not allowed
to watch that show

183
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,496
'cause it glamorizes
inappropriateness.

184
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,966
It'll be okay.
Just close your eyes.

185
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:34,140
We get it, warnings,
this show is awesome.

186
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:41,081
Now that she's gone,
she's finally popular.

187
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,317
I'm gonna ask her ghost
to the prom.

188
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,226
Someone's about to go viral.

189
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,728
Baby videos are super popular.

190
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:08,575
<i>I think I could stay here
for the rest of my life</i>

191
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,644
<i>Please don't ever
make me go home</i>

192
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,636
What are you doing in here?
This is the caterers' bathroom.

193
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:39,239
This Japanese toilet
is the first kind voice

194
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,840
I've heard all night.

195
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,813
Addy, why did you invite me to
this party? Just to torture me?

196
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,816
Okay.
Full disclosure, I invited you

197
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:52,852
because those other girls
are always so mean to me.

198
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:56,556
But then they were mean to you
instead and let me join in.

199
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,392
Oh, thanks for making this
the best birthday ever.

200
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:04,164
Wait, no aw. That's horrible.

201
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,965
No, don't you see?

202
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,134
Next time, you bring a Lisa.

203
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,371
Someone from band camp
or science club or whatever,

204
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:16,509
and then we'll all turn on her
and you'll be part of the squad.

205
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:19,712
No, no. No, this can't
be who you really are.

206
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,182
Let me whiten your teeth, Lisa.
I've got strips.

207
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:27,587
Strips, Lisa! Lisa, come back!
I've got whitening strips!

208
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:32,258
And it's the Old-Man-apolis 500,

209
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,360
but he spun out
into Dead Man's Crack.

210
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,199
Grampa, it's Lisa.

211
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,134
- I need your help.
- What's the matter, loser?

212
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,169
Did a horse bite your head off,
and now you're crying

213
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,938
because you don't have a head?

214
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,574
Called it.

215
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,776
The girls at this party
are so mean,

216
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:53,213
there's no one else to help me,
and I just want to go home.

217
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,216
Oh, I would love to help,
but you un-brothered me.

218
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:59,619
Now all I am is a stranger
who magnetized your saxophone.

219
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,423
Please, somewhere inside you

220
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,792
there is an ember of connection
between us.

221
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:09,229
This is me asking you
to fan that ember.

222
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,297
Call me back and say it
in a normal way.

223
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,405
Get me out of here!

224
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,675
Look, the rando's talking
into a phone.

225
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,112
Phones are for
looking at, rando.

226
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,047
Bart, they're taking my phone.

227
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,149
They're even meaner than you.

228
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,627
Are you Juan Starnotip?

229
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,562
Just drive.

230
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,266
So, Juan, going somewhere
this evening?

231
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,768
The entered address.

232
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:51,471
I like you, Juan. You're clearly
comfortable in your own skin.

233
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,273
Can I interest you
in a room-temperature

234
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,207
sparkling water?

235
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,176
I requested no conversation.

236
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,847
Hey!

237
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,048
Give it back!

238
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,083
Ew, this phone
is made by Subway.

239
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:09,022
My dad had to eat
a thousand footlongs for that!

240
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,124
Hey.

241
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,728
Quit hitting on my wife,
you crooning sex pirate.

242
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,232
Whoa, that chick behind that
blue-haired lady's your wife?

243
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,402
Way to go, man.

244
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,170
Oh, right.

245
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:27,173
I'll just get out of your way.

246
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:35,181
This is for not
hitting on my wife.

247
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,153
The set list!

248
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,688
Our banter was on there.

249
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,790
What songs do we know?

250
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,902
Without the booze,
it's just a cruise!

251
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,904
Dude, you killed the music.

252
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,572
And the vibe.

253
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,607
Time of death, 10:13 p.m.

254
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,060
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

255
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,563
Now let's get out of here
before they realize I'm gone.

256
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,998
This sleepover isn't over.

257
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,968
No, yes, it is.
When we leave, it's over.

258
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,937
Look, I didn't come here
to rescue you.

259
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,339
If you run now,
you'll never stop running.

260
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:34,907
What do you mean?

261
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:38,144
There's one present you still
have to give those rich girls.

262
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,647
- Revenge.
- Revenge?

263
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,284
Revenge.

264
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:53,860
Okay, right. Revenge.
Right. I can do that.

265
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,895
- What do I do?
- I can't tell you.

266
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:58,698
True revenge can only come
from the hate in your own heart.

267
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:01,734
Hate.

268
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:07,006
If you do it tight enough,
it's just like a face-lift.

269
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,242
Oh, my God.
I could pass for six.

270
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,713
I know just what to do.

271
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,703
Hi, Mom.

272
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,073
I saw you called a bunch
of times. Is everything okay?

273
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,075
Yeah, everything is great.
I love you, good night.

274
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,479
At least she's having fun.

275
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,981
Your Mos Eisley fracas
has utterly harshed

276
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,850
my Arrakeen spice buzz.

277
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,653
That's right,
a two-reference complaint!

278
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,355
My wife and I have been looking
forward to this for months,

279
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,157
and you ruined our plans.

280
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:04,764
Plans? Yeah, we all
love to make plans, don't we?

281
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:07,967
Dinner and a movie,
couples' karaoke, game night

282
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:10,970
where the hosts are really just
trying to sell Amway.

283
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:15,141
We're all so eager
to get out of the house.

284
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,409
But why?

285
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,411
To stand in line
to have your picture taken

286
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,147
holding a mustache on a stick?

287
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:27,787
And all these magical plans are
supposed to lead up to romance.

288
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,956
But when you get home,
you feel tired and gross

289
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,624
and a thousand years old.

290
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:34,160
So you make plans
for another night and another,

291
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:37,129
and the cycle continues
until the only time

292
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,799
you touch your wife
is when you don't notice

293
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:44,270
she's on the toilet at 4:00 a.m.
and you sit on her.

294
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:47,907
I didn't ruin this cruise.

295
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:50,376
I saved your life.

296
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:54,947
Now return to your homes
and never make plans again.

297
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:12,231
That egghead rando
messed with our hair.

298
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,335
We look like her!

299
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,640
Don't worry.
I have a car waiting.

300
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,979
An airport pickup
during surge pricing?

301
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,182
So long, dot matrix printer,
hello, bubble jet.

302
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,617
This way.

303
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,929
You go ahead.

304
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,031
You don't hate horses.

305
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,333
You're afraid of them.

306
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,836
No, I'm not. I just hate
any animal that works with cops.

307
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,040
No creature
should be that jacked.

308
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,242
You didn't let me quit
when I was scared,

309
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,044
so I'm gonna help you see

310
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,848
that this majestic creature
has a gentle soul.

311
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,118
Not behind her!
She'll kick your face off!

312
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,747
We're gonna destroy you
on Insta, TikTok and Postmates.

313
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,048
You'll be a total outcast

314
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,484
and you'll have
to pick up your own sushi.

315
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,119
Ugh, no Wi-Fi?

316
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:42,989
Does your horse even have
a mobile hot spot, Addison?

317
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:46,292
Addison, can I talk to Addy,
my book buddy?

318
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,161
I have to be Addison.

319
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,497
Addy's just a little girl.

320
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,332
Don't you remember
when we were reading this?

321
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:56,902
We were just kids,
sharing something we loved.

322
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,138
Addison, she's trying
to influence you,

323
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,073
and she's not even
monetizing it.

324
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,343
I'm so going to swat her house
on Christmas morning.

325
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,746
Don't let that rando upset you.

326
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,981
Have a Klonopin gummy.

327
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:11,283
Be the girl I know you are.

328
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,323
Old book smell.

329
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,060
Stop holding a book, Addison.
You're acting like a rando.

330
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,131
My name is Addy.

331
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,236
Oh, my...

332
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,972
Go!

333
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,175
Come with us. There's nothing
left for you here.

334
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,977
It's my house.
All my stuff is in it.

335
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:41,013
Oh, right, right.
Well, all right.

336
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,549
Maybe I'll see you
at the library.

337
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,117
Lisa?

338
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,219
You were my best gift.

339
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,824
Addison, are you
out of your mind?

340
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:54,593
Netflix should make a series
about your social life,

341
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,829
because it just
committed suicide.

342
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:59,832
She is so mean.

343
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,234
I want to be her friend.

344
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,836
Literally.
