1
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,911
Welcome. Good to see you.

2
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,779
If you're here
to use the bathroom,

3
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:48,248
try the Burger King next door.

4
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,384
Actually,
we'd like to buy something.

5
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,953
Wunderbar.
I offer many things.

6
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,354
Astounding tricks,

7
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,557
confounding illusions.

8
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,892
I also fix iPhones.

9
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,128
You've heard of Steve Jobs?

10
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,830
This is my kid, No Jobs.

11
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,866
- Dad!
- He's been angry

12
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:08,101
since I made his mother
disappear

13
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:11,438
with my cold attitude
and the philandering.

14
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:12,673
Achtung, Gramps.

15
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,142
I want to buy a magic set
for my sister's birthday

16
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,053
'cause that's the kind
of lame‐o thing she'd like.

17
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,779
Magic is not lame‐o.

18
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:22,382
Let me show you a trick
that made Angela Merkel say,

19
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:25,385
you are the worst
Uber driver ever.

20
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,422
This underwear was once worn

21
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,425
by Babar, King of the Elephants.

22
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,760
Elephant underwear
is tighty‐whities on Homer.

23
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,563
Why, you little...!

24
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,766
What the...? The more I pull,

25
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,101
the tighter it gets.

26
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:43,737
The only solution? Pull more.

27
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:52,779
Will you two ever stop?

28
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:53,914
Ever?

29
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:56,249
Is it the future you seek?

30
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,685
Well, then,
move through this beaded curtain

31
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:03,256
and past the Keurig coffee maker
I bought but never use.

32
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:11,098
Let us see what the tarot cards
have to say.

33
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,166
Tarot cards don't work.

34
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,570
Don't they, Madam President?

35
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,209
Now let us see
what happens to Homer and Bart.

36
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,977
How does he know our names?

37
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:26,647
They are
on your Starbucks coffee cups.

38
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,685
Good news, Homer.

39
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:32,752
In the future,

40
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,755
you stop drinking.

41
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,758
And the boy
becomes a fine person.

42
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,992
What? No!

43
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,894
Reversum predictum!

44
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,030
It's licorice. Have some.

45
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,067
Now I turn more cards and...

46
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:49,803
Oh, dear.
This is rough. Very bad.

47
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,138
What? What?

48
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,873
There will be years of trouble

49
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,208
between Marge and Lisa.

50
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:02,983
The trouble begins
when you decide

51
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,185
where you will go to college.

52
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,788
What? Why are you saying that?
What's wrong?

53
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,923
Do I get wait‐listed?
Gap year?

54
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,925
Cornell?!

55
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,827
Let's just say
things have changed

56
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:15,729
when you are 17.

57
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,207
Rise and shine!

58
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,743
Mom, please.

59
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,478
I was asleep.

60
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,180
Today's the day
you're gonna find out

61
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,348
what colleges you get into.

62
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,751
Who cares?
They all lost their glitter

63
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,519
when Netflix bought Yale.

64
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,288
Well, you will be
the first Simpson

65
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:44,891
to ever finish college
now that Bart's given up.

66
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,860
Why should I go to college?

67
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,462
I've become a master

68
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,931
of Fruit Ninja.

69
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,870
Salad complete.

70
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,410
There she is.

71
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:06,646
Our family's last
and only remaining hope.

72
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,782
Putting on a little pressure
there, Grampa?

73
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,585
It's just that you're
the only worthwhile Simpson

74
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:12,853
since... ever.

75
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,387
I'm counting on you
to find the cure

76
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,856
for everything
that's gonna kill me.

77
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,524
No pressure.

78
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,694
Wait a minute.
This is on the wrong eye.

79
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,096
Ooh, much better.

80
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,102
Lisa, I have a question.

81
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,506
Please, don't mention
the word college.

82
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,141
College? No way.

83
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,376
This is a surprise promposal.

84
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,979
Guess who I hired to ask you
on my behalf.

85
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,247
My dad.

86
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,850
Imitating Seth MacFarlane
imitating Frank Sinatra.

87
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:46,219
<i>Take him to the prom</i>

88
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:50,657
<i>And let him dance
forevermore</i>

89
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:53,326
<i>If you turn him down</i>

90
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:57,130
<i>He will curl up on the floor</i>

91
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,032
<i>In other words</i>

92
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,568
<i>We're desperate</i>

93
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,069
We really are.

94
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,206
<i>A pity yes will do</i>

95
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:10,143
And you'll have to drive
'cause he can't.

96
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,611
I can see you're tempted, Lis.

97
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,247
There's nothing cooler
than a guy who's graduated

98
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,617
coming back for a younger kid's
prom.

99
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,556
Get out of here before
I accidentally say okay.

100
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,924
Did I hear an okay?

101
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,464
Aw, hey, kid.
What's the matter?

102
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,267
Your whole life, for reasons
I'll never understand,

103
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,469
you've been looking forward
to college.

104
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,571
Today, you get in.

105
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,673
Things have changed
since I was a kid.

106
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:43,143
College costs a fortune,
and does it really do any good?

107
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,979
All you get is a piece of paper
with your name on it.

108
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,280
And it's written in Latin,

109
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,549
so the only people
who can actually read it

110
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,785
are dead Romans
and Catholic priests.

111
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:55,555
And last I checked, none of them
are handing out jobs.

112
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:59,893
Then why did you study so hard
and miss all the fun?

113
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:04,164
<i>Old days</i>

114
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:08,902
<i>Good times I remember</i>

115
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,371
<i>Fun days</i>

116
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:15,442
<i>Filled with simple pleasure</i>

117
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,944
I don't know now.
I think of all those years

118
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,713
where instead of being
behind a book,

119
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,348
I could've played kickball.

120
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,683
So many jump ropes un‐jumped.

121
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,785
Do you ever feel regret, Bart?

122
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,255
I regret
starting this conversation.

123
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,291
Every one. I got into every one.

124
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:33,827
Why does this moment
feel so empty?

125
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,965
Come one, come all.
Don't miss it.

126
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,400
Lisa, I told everyone

127
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,102
you're going to make
your pick today.

128
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,871
This is the greatest moment
of my life.

129
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,173
Drumroll!

130
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,978
<i>A Simpson got into college</i>

131
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,980
<i>A Simpson got into college</i>

132
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:57,250
<i>A Simpson got into college</i>

133
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:00,253
<i>And I just never applied</i>

134
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,591
Everyone, shh!
It's the moment of truth.

135
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,695
Congratulations, Lisa.
Which one are you gonna choose?

136
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,264
Bob Jones. Bob Jones.
Bob Jones.

137
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,801
I...

138
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:17,370
I'm not going to college.

139
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,639
What?! Quit joking.

140
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:22,542
Marge, nobody knows comedy
like I don't.

141
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,144
She's not joking.

142
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,646
Lisa, you can't do this.
We're counting on you.

143
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,982
Well, you know, Marge,
I didn't go to college,

144
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,685
and I'm wealthy
in the most important way,

145
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,286
lack of student loans.

146
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,255
Do not encourage her.

147
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,524
Marge, her not going to college

148
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,894
is the most money
I'll ever earn.

149
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,862
Lisa, please. I'm giving you

150
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,765
one last chance
to salvage this day.

151
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,200
I've lived for this moment.

152
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,102
And all I've ever asked from you

153
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,571
is that everything
that never happened to me

154
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,539
happens to you.

155
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,541
And that justifies
my existence on Earth

156
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,645
for the hours I spent
holding you, cleaning you,

157
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,080
cooking your supper,
drying your tears,

158
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,382
catching your colds

159
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:05,385
and burying
every personal need I had

160
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,520
just so I could have
the brief joy

161
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,389
of setting up your dorm room

162
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,658
with the roommate
from the fancy family

163
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:15,628
who you'll spend the holidays
with on their ranch in Colorado

164
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,331
instead of coming home to me.

165
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,633
Once and for all,

166
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,202
which college are you going to?

167
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,771
None.

168
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,384
I just wanted to say one thing.

169
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,486
- What's that?
- Ingrate!

170
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,455
I'm sorry,
but could you have decided

171
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,991
you didn't want to go to college
before ten years

172
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:48,461
of me driving you
to saxophone lessons, SAT prep,

173
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,865
college tours of colleges
you were never gonna go to?!

174
00:08:56,602 --> 00:09:00,707
Could it be that I'm finally
the favorite parent?

175
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,809
Maggie, whose side are you on?

176
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,714
I don't like
how digital she's getting.

177
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,050
Aw, you know just what to say.

178
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,453
Honey,

179
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,821
I baked you brownies to eat

180
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,857
while you reconsider
stuff you've done or said.

181
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,625
Wait a minute.
Do you actually think

182
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,929
your brownies
will affect my life decisions?

183
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,530
They have walnuts in them.

184
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,966
Mom, I never really liked
your brownies,

185
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,268
and I'm not going to college.

186
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,471
Really? Who are you?

187
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,239
All my life,
I did what I thought

188
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,874
other people wanted me to do.

189
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,542
Now I'm doing what I want.

190
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,879
Someday, you're gonna have
a daughter of your own,

191
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,547
and you'll see how I feel.

192
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,416
Who says I'm gonna have kids?

193
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:44,751
No college? No kids?

194
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,420
How dare you lead the life
I wish I'd led.

195
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:50,089
I'm burned out.
I'm so burned out.

196
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,825
I just need some time to think.

197
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,227
Okay. Just promise me

198
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,462
that before you make
any final decisions,

199
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,966
- you'll talk to...
- I know, I know. My father.

200
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,234
I'm talking about the man

201
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,136
who's been there
for every birthday.

202
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:07,306
The one man who took pride
in your every achievement.

203
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,917
I'd love to talk with you,
Lisa, but first...

204
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,544
Boys, it's 6:00 p.m.
Time for bed.

205
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,682
College was my dream.
Then I thought,

206
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:20,019
is it really my dream
or just everyone else's?

207
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,854
Lisa, use the gifts God gave you

208
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,623
for whatever path
he puts you on.

209
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:27,293
Get a job. Learn the pride that comes
with getting your own paycheck.

210
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,430
Of course. The dignity of work.

211
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,098
Thank you, Mr. Flanders.

212
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,834
Daddy, can you come upstairs?

213
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,302
We're scared.

214
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,638
Daddy, bring the monster spray!

215
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:42,041
I may have over‐coddled them
just a little bit.

216
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,244
Now, I'm afraid
the next kilometer

217
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,247
on Lisa's autobahn of life
would not be,

218
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,917
as you say, easy peasy.

219
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,355
Ooh, could I double down
on those?

220
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,291
This is not blackjack.

221
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,159
I said hit me.

222
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,461
Not blackjack.

223
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,862
Come on, pal, hit me.

224
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:03,863
Fine.

225
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,931
You're busted.

226
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,000
D'oh! Should've held
on the hard Knave of Cups.

227
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,902
I have no regrets.

228
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,704
I have no regrets.

229
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,106
I have no regrets.

230
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:20,313
Simpson, the corn
isn't sticking to the dogs.

231
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,682
Why did I waste 30 minutes
training you?

232
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,218
Now the pulp is settling
in the lemonade!

233
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,819
Pump! Pump!

234
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,488
Pump...!

235
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,223
Why am I working here?

236
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,624
Even I can't answer that,

237
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,193
and I was a philosophy major
at Brown.

238
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,260
Brown!

239
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,930
Brown...!

240
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,499
God, that job sucks.

241
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,467
Here's a little secret, honey.

242
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,602
All jobs suck.

243
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,537
That's why you get paid
to do them.

244
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:45,905
So you had your gap week.

245
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,274
Now you're finally going
to college, right?

246
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:49,775
No. Not ever.

247
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,512
Okay, I can't change this,
and I can't accept this.

248
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:56,048
What do I do? Go downstairs
and yell into the dryer.

249
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,486
Why is she doing this?!

250
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,854
Why won't she go to college?!

251
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,056
We've been planning this
her whole life!

252
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,391
Why?!

253
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,560
I'll have that picture
and that picture

254
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:10,329
and a diet that picture,
if'n you please.

255
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,864
Can't you read the names?

256
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:12,999
No, ma'am.

257
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,734
You seem to read just fine,

258
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,769
and you're stuck in this dump.

259
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:17,904
Not anymore.

260
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,272
I know what I'm gonna do.

261
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:22,909
I hope it starts with pressin'
the button what brings my food.

262
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,044
Nope. I'm not gonna learn.

263
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,178
I'm gonna teach!

264
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,214
I'm gonna start
an after‐school program,

265
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,950
individualized and
accessible to children

266
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,418
who fall through the cracks.

267
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,453
What are you going to do
for money?

268
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,621
Workman's comp.

269
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,391
I'd like to see you try.

270
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,060
On my way!

271
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,731
Welcome to the Boundless
Horizons School,

272
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,600
where I'm gonna change
your lives

273
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,769
and you're gonna write letters
to me forever

274
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:53,773
and you'll say I was
your most influential person.

275
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,676
Just exactly how
are you gonna teach us?</i>

276
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,245
Well, I'm gonna use
every trick there is.

277
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,046
I'll put the desks in a circle.

278
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,582
I'll take
the toughest one of you

279
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:05,451
and put him or her in charge
of making everyone behave.

280
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:09,488
And I'll teach Shakespeare
using dances from TikTok.

281
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,123
<i>Out, out, damned spot</i>

282
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,993
<i>This is the way that
Shakespeare should be taught</i>

283
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:19,332
Her incredible lameness
has me riveted.

284
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:22,201
Finally, someone who gets me
as a stereotype.

285
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,203
Wait one minute, young lady.

286
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,339
You cannot just open
your own school

287
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,941
and start to better
random lives.

288
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:31,344
You have to sign this form

289
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,313
and pay a $25 city business tax.

290
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,615
Okay.

291
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,450
Just give me the change, please.

292
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,085
This is embarrassing.

293
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,153
I'm not great at math.

294
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,955
Leave that to me.

295
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,073
Lisa Simpson's
after‐school program

296
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,942
has been a tremendous success.

297
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,610
Unlike the news business.

298
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,114
Lisa now has over 100 franchises
here in the Illiteracy Belt.

299
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,450
And now, given her high profile
and 80% approval rating,

300
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,586
Lisa's running
for state school superintendent

301
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:16,122
against incumbent Gary Chalmers.

302
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,923
Under my opponent,

303
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,725
test scores have fallen.

304
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,728
Graduation rates have fallen.

305
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:26,799
I am not going to stand here and
listen to some nasty woman...

306
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,970
I'm just trying to make
a point, all right?

307
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:34,173
I'm not gonna let some stupid,
nasty, homely woman...

308
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,877
Simpson!

309
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:38,944
I concede.

310
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,813
Congratulations.

311
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,016
Beloved superintendent
of schools, Lisa Simpson,

312
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,618
is now running for governor!

313
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,386
Soon she'll move
beyond the scope

314
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,755
of a career‐stuck
local anchorman like me.

315
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,490
This is Kent Brockman
signing off...

316
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,392
Lisa Simpson, governor of...

317
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,593
is running for president.

318
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,495
Not even her
highly damaged relationship

319
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,230
with her mother
can stop her now.

320
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,665
Nate Silver analyzes.

321
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,300
Well, George,
Lisa is doing great

322
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,601
with disenchanted daughters.

323
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,903
Also tiger moms,
checked‐out dads

324
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,739
and grandparents
who like everything,

325
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,474
plus middle children,
nerds of all ages

326
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,209
and saxophonists
above second chair.

327
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,879
Now, it's a week
before the election but...

328
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,781
what the hell,
I'm calling it for Lisa.

329
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,349
My work here is done.

330
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,717
Good luck, America.

331
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,555
It's 5:38 somewhere.

332
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,759
This just in.
Lisa Simpson has been elected

333
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:29,094
the eighth president
who did not go to college,

334
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,630
joining George Washington,
Abraham Lincoln

335
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,032
and Harry S. Truman.

336
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,567
Think about that when you're
paying your student loans.

337
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,069
Stephanopoulos out.

338
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,905
My daughter
really becomes president?

339
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:43,409
Yes. But you have to learn it
on the streets.

340
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,347
Great news
about your daughter, Marge.

341
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,382
She's finally going to college?

342
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,917
No. She's president.

343
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,685
You knew that, didn't you?

344
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,789
Oh, crap.
I really am out of the loop.

345
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,693
Look, the heart of the story
is Lisa and me.

346
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,529
Do we finally get along?

347
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,997
Also, in the future,

348
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,132
how many more Ghostbusters
do they make?

349
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,736
Four. The gay Ghostbusters
is fantastic.

350
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,772
Can't we dwell on the fact
that I was president?

351
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,274
So concerned about your futures

352
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:18,477
but no one cares about mine.

353
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:19,711
I won't get into details,

354
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:23,582
but my body winds up in
the dumpster behind the store.

355
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:25,717
Do any of you give a damn?

356
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,453
Very well.

357
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,056
Now we have come
to the final two cards.

358
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,158
The future will be revealed.

359
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:36,294
But first, I want to plug
my gig this Saturday

360
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:39,297
at the Comedy & Magic Club.

361
00:16:40,565 --> 00:16:43,902
I conjure the spirit
of Rodney Dangerfield.

362
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,071
Ich bekomme keinen respekt.

363
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,773
I'm telling you.

364
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,741
Here we are.

365
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,376
It's Inauguration Day,

366
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:55,514
and Marge and Lisa
are barely speaking.

367
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:00,318
And I promise you that,
as your president,

368
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:02,621
I will obsess over your welfare,

369
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:04,923
because I don't have a life!

370
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,792
You're all I've got!

371
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:09,594
And I will serve you.

372
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,536
And we'll get right on that!

373
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:19,004
Madam President,

374
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,639
just after you were sworn in,

375
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:22,474
your predecessor
finally conceded.

376
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,077
These transitional tantrums
get longer and longer.

377
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,081
Okay, he promised
he'd leave after he did that.

378
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:32,284
But you're going to be
a great president.

379
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,152
Thank you.

380
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,921
But maybe not a happy one.

381
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:36,987
Bart!

382
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,057
Oh, I almost hugged you.

383
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,792
Well, I almost wish you had.

384
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,360
I think I will.

385
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:43,427
I hope you do.

386
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:45,764
I know what you need.

387
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,934
Some President's Choice
High Carumba.

388
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,869
Why did you bring that here?

389
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,070
A, it's legal.

390
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,805
B, somehow still cool.

391
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:56,374
And C,
you really need to chill out.

392
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:06,418
He's with me! He's with me!

393
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:09,754
Oh, I got to tell you something.

394
00:18:09,821 --> 00:18:12,357
Now that we're both grown
and successful...

395
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,492
you, president,

396
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:15,160
me, pot CEO

397
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,896
and owner of three NBA teams.

398
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,397
I feel different.

399
00:18:19,464 --> 00:18:22,534
I really, really,
really don't hate you.

400
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,637
Got anything to say to me?

401
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,772
Yes.

402
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,974
All right.

403
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,175
I'll admit it.

404
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,245
I've always been
kind of a pain in the butt.

405
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:35,714
If you had said that earlier,

406
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,049
even I would have voted for you.

407
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,455
Wow, that's pretty cool

408
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,791
for someone who was
always unpopular.

409
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:48,326
But, but wait!

410
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,194
Not my fault.

411
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,263
Because,
I don't know if you know,

412
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:55,267
but I did not come from a family
that made things easy.

413
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,537
Well, maybe you didn't make
things easier for them either.

414
00:18:58,603 --> 00:19:00,639
Maybe Mom was the one
who was helping you

415
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:02,674
in ways you don't even remember.

416
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,278
<i>Old days</i>

417
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:10,749
<i>Good times I remember</i>

418
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:12,350
<i>Fun days...</i>

419
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,561
Mom?

420
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:23,929
She's clean.
Checked her hair.

421
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:25,330
Took 45 minutes.

422
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,832
I'm here to see
if you'll finally admit

423
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:30,502
you'd be better off
if you'd gone to college.

424
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,503
Are you crazy?

425
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,638
You still can't admit
you were wrong.

426
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,307
Let me tell you something, lady.

427
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:37,976
Wait a minute.
Just... Just wait a minute.

428
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,511
I'm president now.

429
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,513
I have a lot of resources.

430
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,115
Where's my mom translator?

431
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,985
Maybe I started off
on the wrong foot.

432
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,120
You constantly let me down.

433
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:52,424
Of course, I appreciate
everything you're saying.

434
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,492
You were never really in
my corner.

435
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,629
I may have said
a lot of things in anger.

436
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,565
I meant what I said
and I will stick to it.

437
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:04,703
But no matter what,
I was always proud of you.

438
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:06,504
You made me mad too.

439
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:08,840
I was hurt
because I care so much.

440
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:12,677
All the respect and love I have
for people came from you.

441
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,179
That's nice to hear.

442
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:15,680
I love you so much.

443
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,683
I love you too.

444
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:23,822
Okay, you can go now.

445
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:25,991
This translator is fantastic.

446
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:27,559
Give her a raise.

447
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:45,176
Okay. I enjoyed that story,
but I got to know,

448
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:46,811
how much is really true?

449
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,648
Let me consult the oracle.

450
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:52,117
Okay, Lisa,
I'll give it to you straight.

451
00:20:52,183 --> 00:20:54,853
You've got a 98% chance
of going to college,

452
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:56,254
83% Ivy League,

453
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:57,822
47% chance of a boyfriend,

454
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,824
72% chance of a girlfriend.

455
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:03,161
I like those odds!

456
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,030
Hey, can I get the game on this?

457
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:07,065
It's not a TV.
