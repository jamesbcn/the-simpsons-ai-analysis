00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,064
you'll know how much we love you.

174
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:59,351
Like the one pair of blue pants
I bought Homer 20 years ago.

175
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,187
They're like a wedding ring;

176
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,072
I can't take them off anymore.

177
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,569
(sighs)

178
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,700
Oh, Moe, this suit really brings out

179
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,238
the herringbone in your eyes.

180
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,283
Hmm.

181
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:15,286
Nah, it's a 44 long. I wear a 38 hunched.

182
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,539
Got anything for a man my size?

183
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,332
Absolutely not.
Tent City is across the street.

184
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,786
Tent, eh?

185
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,836
(humming)

186
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:27,974
Hmm.

187
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,509
No husband of mine is wearing a tent.

188
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,603
No tents, no barrels, no kiddie pools.

189
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,968
Thank you, fashion police!

190
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,138
Hey, not bad, not bad.

191
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,346
And look over there, Moe.

192
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,806
That's me?

193
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,976
Hey, thank you, guys. Thanks.

194
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,065
It's a brand-new day! (chuckles)

195
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,072
Okay, final checklist.

196
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,494
Checklist ready? Check.

197
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,737
Mom and Dad still gone?

198
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,334
Uh, check.

199
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,329
What about that snoopy girl reporter
that's always hanging around?

200
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,662
You mean my sister?

201
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,497
She's your sister?

202
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,922
The plot thickens.

203
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,250
Clueless little Lisa
doesn't suspect a thing.

204
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,086
(upbeat jazz music playing)

205
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:10,471
Whatever Bart's doing,
it's got to be pretty bad

206
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,180
for him to get me tickets
to this amazing jam session.

207
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,774
All the greats are here:

208
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,140
Jellyroll Jones, Boston Cream Basie,

209
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,108
Birthmark Billy Jackson, Grabass Walker,

210
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,319
the Fatneck Sisters and... (gasps)

211
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,191
Bleeding Gums Murphy?

212
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:34,448
<i>♪ I got this bratty brother ♪</i>

213
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,952
<i>♪ He bugs me every day ♪</i>

214
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,454
No, that's impossible. He's dead.

215
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,537
I lay a saxophone reed
at his grave every year.

216
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,213
Lights and magic, Lisa.

217
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,752
You don't need anything else.

218
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,415
But I took a bunch of stuff anyway.

219
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,723
It's a hologram?

220
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,010
Well, maybe if it's in good taste.

221
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,021
Aw, come on.

222
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,600
Five seconds to slip-off.

223
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,095
And four, three...

224
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,266
Boy, what are you doing up here?!

225
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,685
Also, what am I doing up here?

226
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,694
Bart, you said your grandfather
wouldn't bother us.

227
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,357
I gave him a caramel.

228
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,106
He should have been chewing for hours.

229
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,567
I couldn't unwrap it!

230
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,617
-(yells)
-I got you, Grampa!

231
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,581
Hold, bolo, hold!

232
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,712
I don't want to die!
I want to still be a burden!

233
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,792
-(yelling)
-(all gasp)

234
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,297
Please be okay.

235
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:41,215
<i>♪ How deep is your love?</i>
<i>How deep is your love? ♪</i>

236
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,677
Boy?

237
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,767
Yes, Grampa?!

238
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,481
Kiss my forehead.

239
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,311
(groans)

240
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,398
Man, I must really love him.

241
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,112
(suctions)

242
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,909
(pops)

243
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,240
I'm not gonna die today.

244
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,196
Aw, that's so sweet.

245
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,746
Let's get all our grandfathers

246
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,999
and chuck them down this thing.

247
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,621
-All right!
-All right!

248
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,667
Why am I in the basement?

249
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,715
Shouldn't I see a medico?

250
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,429
If the Wilsons' calf is birthed,

251
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,179
Doc Miller should be available.

252
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,510
Thank God your mental powers
haven't deteriorated.

253
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,426
Well, why the hell am I down here?!

254
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,845
I was supposed to be in charge of you.

255
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,854
I can't let Mom and Dad
know what I did.

256
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,606
But I promise I'll take good care of you
until you're well again.

257
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,729
No deal! I'm getting out of here.

258
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,896
(groans) Ooh, wow.

259
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,824
My tailbone!

260
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,323
And it was my last good bone.

261
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,816
(groans)

262
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,737
There, there, you'll be fine.

263
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,486
I'll take care of everything you need.

264
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,247
I want a foot rub.

265
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,079
Yes, but do you need one?

266
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,584
Nobody needs one!

267
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,746
Now start rubbing!

268
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:50,884
(groans)

269
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,290
Rub harder!

270
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,380
(humming)

271
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,684
(grunts) Sorry, pal.

272
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,140
"Sorry, pal"?

273
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,680
Hey, that's common courtesy.

274
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,723
The kind I've only seen in movies.

275
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,597
This suit is amazing!

276
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,347
Eh, this dump is too filthy

277
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,568
for a man with a positive worldview.

278
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:15,228
I'm gonna start cleaning.

279
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,487
Dirt. Carpet.

280
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,990
Another layer of dirt.

281
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,821
Congoleum. (gasps)

282
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:21,986
Hardwood!

283
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,914
The perfect floor for doing a happy jig.

284
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,871
(upbeat music playing)

285
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,378
And now to light up the sign
and let the world know

286
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,875
that the new, improved Moe's
is open for business.

287
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,184
Hmm.

288
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,885
Wow, non-losers?

289
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,885
Huh, I never thought I'd see the day.

290
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,647
Gentlemen, what can I get you?

291
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,979
We'll take anything you've got
aged 15 years or more.

292
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,234
Hmm.

293
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,653
Hmm.

294
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,993
(squeaking)

295
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:04,871
Well, actually, I do have this
bourbon that I brewed myself.

296
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,950
It'll either be
the best thing you ever had

297
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,906
or the last thing you'll ever have.

298
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:09,826
-Mmm.
-Huh.

299
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,552
Wow! Hey, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

300
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,880
Moe, we're venture capitalists.

301
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,974
We turn dreams into money
that mostly goes to us,

302
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,180
-but you get a little.
-Tell me more!

303
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,930
How many bottles of this
Kentucky Kool-Aid do you have?

304
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:29,353
Just the one, but I could whip up
two or 300,000 more.

305
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,643
Moe, you got a great product,
a fantastic suit,

306
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,267
and we're gonna give you
everything you need.

307
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,524
Startup money, branding specialists.

308
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,726
Corporate jets, private drivers.

309
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,647
If your feet touch the ground,
we've failed.

310
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,695
This is all so sudden.

311
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,833
Now it's not. I'm in!

312
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,828
Only one more thing we need to do.

313
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,660
Check this out with our focus group.

314
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,745
{\an8}Mm!

315
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,631
{\an8}(murmurs happily)

316
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,633
-So, what do we think?
-Be honest, now.

317
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,875
{\an8}I love it!

318
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,507
{\an8}I've made a lot of mistakes,

319
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,143
{\an8}but liking this ain't one of them.

320
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,595
(groans)

321
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,142
Every time I call
Grampa's phone, I get no answer.

322
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,726
Uh, he told me he was gonna
nap most of the week.

323
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,403
Oh! Oh, good.

324
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,861
Well, he needs his sleep.

325
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,662
Time for your meds!

326
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,033
-Come on, blue!
-Come on, pink!

327
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,037
Take it, take it, there you go, yes!

328
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:34,249
After a pulse-pounding race,
hypertension pills win again.

329
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,841
Call me crazy, but I can't stop
betting on dementia.

330
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,708
Now, what say we turn
the hot water on and off

331
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,756
while your father's taking a shower?

332
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,550
HOMER: Oh! (gasping)

333
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,434
Hot, oh! Cold, oh!

334
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,641
(screams)

335
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,181
Thank God I'm not in the shower!

336
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,644
(both laughing)

337
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,773
Hmm.

338
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,435
Grampa, we've been spending
so much time together,

339
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,034
I almost feel like you're
part of the family.

340
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,530
Aw.

341
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,532
And I've been wondering.
Not like I miss having my afternoons free

342
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:11,365
or anything, but...
are you starting to feel better?

343
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,872
Absolutely not!

344
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,793
My crotch is crotchety,
sitting down makes me uppity,

345
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,213
and you call these cups pleated?!

346
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,882
Okay, okay, just checking.
(sighs)

347
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,341
"Dear She-Done-Left-Me Records,

348
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:27,722
Once again, I write protesting
your holographic exploitation

349
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,051
of blues icon Bleeding Gums Murphy.

350
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,927
I call for a boycott and girl-cott

351
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,475
of your entire catalogue until you..."

352
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,809
-(jazz music playing)
-Sonny Rollins?

353
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,185
That's right, Lisa.

354
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:43,071
And I'm here to beg you
to stop writing those letters.

355
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,610
You're siding with record companies?

356
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,324
This isn't about money, Lisa.

357
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,534
From Tupac Shakur to Dwight Eisenhower,

358
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,786
holograms have introduced some
of our leading dead people

359
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,709
to a new audience
of people with money.

360
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,829
Resetting, resetting.

361
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,166
From Tupac Shakur to Dwight Eisenhower...

362
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,592
You're a hologram, aren't you?

363
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,421
No. Resetting, resetting.

364
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,757
(groans)

365
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,342
Have you no shame?!

366
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,847
Does this answer your question?

367
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,929
-(man beatboxing)
<i>- ♪ My name is Princess Di ♪</i>

368
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,524
<i>♪ And I'm here to say ♪</i>

369
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,019
<i>♪ When I watch a DVD,</i>
<i>it's got to be Blu-ray. ♪</i>

370
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,522
Take it, Gandhi!

371
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,193
First Bank of Springfield--

372
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,611
say "Mumbai" to high checking fees!

373
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,442
(hisses)

374
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,119
MOE: Hey, thanks, guys.

375
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,328
I ain't never been
to no fancy rooftop party before.

376
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,540
No beer?

377
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,619
That's a pretty big screwup.

378
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,205
Moe, we got a special surprise.

379
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,749
You like chicks with nose clips?

380
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,003
-Then you're really gonna be happy.
-Bring it, girls.

381
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,839
Hey, that is the most accurate
picture of my face

382
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,675
made of girl-parts that I have ever seen.

383
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,850
And it's not decadent 'cause you
can ask interns to do anything.

384
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,809
Thanks.
Thank you so much, Ken and Glen.

385
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:56,969
Ah, you're welcome.

386
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,977
Anything to celebrate
your I.P.O. tomorrow.

387
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,269
You know what that is, right?

388
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,522
Um...

389
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,813
Moe, we love your whiskey,
we love your backstory,

390
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,767
and we love that suit
that hangs off you

391
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,938
like silk on a skeleton.

392
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,816
So, starting tomorrow,
we're gonna sell shares

393
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,492
in your company to the public.

394
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,911
All you do is show up
at the stock exchange,

395
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,370
ring the bell,
and you'll leave a rich man.

396
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,371
-(elevator bell dings)
-We'll see you tomorrow.

397
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,753
Enjoy your last night as a Democrat.

398
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,041
Dang it, my suit's stuck in the door.

399
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,377
No, no, no!

400
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,552
This building's got 98 floors!

401
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,470
And I'm going down to P-6!

402
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,839
P-6!

403
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,470
(knocking)

404
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,439
Moe?

405
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,860
What are you doing?

406
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,438
Midge, uh, the suit
got a little mussed up.

407
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,284
I-I got to ask you, is it noticeable?

408
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,030
Thank God the kids aren't here.

409
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,452
LISA: I was.

410
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,527
Aw, without my magic suit, I'm nothing.

411
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,658
The suit wasn't magic, Moe.

412
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,035
Don't you know the story
of Dumbo the elephant?

413
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,252
I didn't go to movies as a kid.

414
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,633
Spent all my time
at the pierogi factory.

415
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,840
Dab the potato, fold the dough.

416
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,761
That was my <i>Star Wars.</i>

417
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,759
Well, Dumbo had a magic feather.

418
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,892
He thought he needed it to fly,

419
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,889
but it turned out the magic was

420
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,931
in him the whole time.

421
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,225
So you're saying Moe is Dumbo,

422
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,019
his bourbon is the giant ears,

423
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,153
and we're that flock of racist crows?

424
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,531
The crows weren't racist,
the people who drew them were.

425
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,069
Okay, I get it, I get it.

426
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,702
It wasn't the suit that made
the bourbon, it was me.

427
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,240
-And I can do anything.
-Don't stand up!

428
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,374
Except stand up.

429
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,620
BART: Grampa,

430
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,121
I made your favorite dinner:

431
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,163
teething biscuits soaked in buttermilk.

432
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,878
(singing "The Blue Danube" waltz)

433
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,509
Oh! Oh! The pain!

434
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,918
(grunting)

435
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,757
You're completely fine!
I've been taking care of you,

436
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,104
giving you love and attention
for nothing!

437
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,009
All right, boy, I admit it.

438
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,728
I've been faking being hurt,
just like I fake

439
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,270
liking those terrible homemade
Christmas gifts you give.

440
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,435
But Mom said it was a gift
made with love.

441
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,694
Did she?

442
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,185
No. Even she thought it was crap.

443
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,358
But what you did wasn't for nothing.

444
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,776
It was the best two weeks

445
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,536
of this final horrible part of my life.

446
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:25,078
Well, you are the first thing
I took care of that didn't die.

447
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,044
(chuckles)
Oh, I hear that a lot.

448
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,336
Hey-ya, guys.

449
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,380
Security, there's
a homeless monster up here!

450
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,303
Hey-hey-hey,
I'm your partner, Moe.

451
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,590
N-Now,
let's go make us a fortune, huh?

452
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,467
-(bell tolling)
-(all gasp)

453
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:45,064
Look!
It's Quasimodo without the pathos!

454
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,692
People, please, please.
My name is Moe Szyslak

455
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:51,319
of Makers Moe Bourbon,
ticker symbol: M-O-E.

456
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,278
I'm the CEO, and I promise
that I will hand-brew

457
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,279
every bottle
with these very hands, huh?

458
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,742
I-I'll supervise production,
I'll manage marketing.

459
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,283
My face is gonna be on every bottle!

460
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:06,407
And we will only use the finest
ingredients made in America.

461
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,826
(booing, clamoring)

462
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,337
Glad you're back, Moe.

463
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,169
At least I don't have
to train a new bartender

464
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:18,585
to make what I like--
beer to the top.

465
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,345
(humming)

466
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,718
(sighs)

467
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,700
Not today, old friend.

468
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:45,452
But don't worry, holidays
are just around the corner.

469
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,174
-(crowd murmuring)
-Shh!

470
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,965
