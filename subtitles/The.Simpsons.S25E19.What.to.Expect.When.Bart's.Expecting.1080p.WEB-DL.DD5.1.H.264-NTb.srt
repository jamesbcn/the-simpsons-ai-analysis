Thanks, Cap. Now what I'm proposing

Our clientele dress up in costume

Yeah, you got it, Moe.

48

Why do they call

you're passed out in your yard.

Oh! Art.

80
00:05:14,117 --> 00:05:15,704
Simpson! Smock up!

81
00:05:15,726 --> 00:05:19,956
Every time I do art, some do-gooder
teacher sends it straight to a therapist.

82
00:05:19,976 --> 00:05:22,378
Your stuff is
pretty disturbing.

83
00:05:22,396 --> 00:05:24,330
I've never acted
on any of it.

84
00:05:24,342 --> 00:05:26,669
You will take art,
you will enjoy art,

85
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:30,156
and you will make something
in a kiln your mother can use.

86
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:32,506

take out the trash!

00:05:45,155 --> 00:05:47,778
And you shall
leave immortal!

91
00:05:47,802 --> 00:05:49,670
Also, take out the trash.

92
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:51,578

93
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:53,333

94
00:05:53,347 --> 00:05:56,007

Oh, Milhouse-ian!

96
00:05:58,578 --> 00:06:01,525
Oh, Bart, it's wonderful!

97
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:04,401
Really? Wonderful? I just
drowned a grasshopper in paint

98
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:06,200
and let him crawl on the
paper till he died.

99
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,964
You know what that's called?
Mixed-media conceptual art.

100
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,100
No, it's not,
because I hate art.

101
00:06:12,113 --> 00:06:14,148
Oh, then it's protest art!

102
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:15,935
Stop encouraging me!

103
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:18,875
I will admire you
from afar...!

104
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,133

you doing here?

107

108
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,565
I gotta find a way to get
rid of my art teacher.

109
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:34,325
Easy. Voodoo.

110
00:06:34,348 --> 00:06:36,214
Is there a voodoo queen
you can direct me to?

111
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,022
Oh, yeah. She lives in a
trailer down by Yogurtland.

112
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,215
Now kiss me. I wanna
make somebody mad.

113
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:42,849

115
00:06:44,172 --> 00:06:46,784
What's my no-good
daughter up to now?

116
00:06:50,057 --> 00:06:53,577
Now u have everyt'ing
you need for the voodoo.

117
00:06:53,594 --> 00:06:55,654
- Would you like a bag?
- Yes, ma'am.

118
00:06:55,686 --> 00:06:58,452
Paper or plastic?

119
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,158
Uh, plastic.

120
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:02,946
Just like the chicken
foot say you would!

121
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,150
Okay, did you get
Trunch's DNA?

122
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:14,697
Yeah, got it out
of her purse.

123
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:15,950
(chuckles)

124
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,063
How'd you do that?

125
00:07:17,078 --> 00:07:19,134
Art teachers don't
have a desk.

126
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,756
They just throw their
purse anywhere.

127
00:07:22,957 --> 00:07:28,158
Voodoo spell, voodoo spell,
seagull beak and bone of Mel,

128
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:30,367
purple heart and tear of chum...

129
00:07:30,391 --> 00:07:31,391
(grunts)

130
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:35,757
Just had to be
tear of chum.

131
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:39,089
Send her home
with aching tum!

132
00:07:41,048 --> 00:07:44,250
Oh, right, we need one more
thing from her purse.

133
00:07:44,272 --> 00:07:45,679
I've got these.

134
00:07:45,685 --> 00:07:49,569
BART: Hmm, she's got tickets 
to the play <i>God of Carnage.</i>

135
00:07:49,576 --> 00:07:50,909
Orchestra?!

136
00:07:50,935 --> 00:07:53,077
On an art teacher's salary?

137
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,115
That's black magic!

138
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:57,162
Where's Mrs. Trunch?

139
00:07:57,171 --> 00:08:01,049
I need to know the correct density
of "points" in my pointillism.

140
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:06,751
Mm, sorry, but I don't think we'll
be seeing much of Trunch today.

141
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,581
Yep, I cast a voodoo
spell on her.

142
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:10,076
I won't bore you with
the dark details,

143
00:08:10,102 --> 00:08:13,617
but let's just say she's in
no condition for teaching.

144
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,433
(gasps)

145
00:08:14,468 --> 00:08:15,261
(disappointed):
Oh...

146
00:08:15,282 --> 00:08:17,464
Class, I have an
announcement.

147
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:21,481
I'm afraid I can't teach today.
I have a tummy ache.

148
00:08:21,495 --> 00:08:24,751
- Mm...
- A very special tummy ache.

149
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,792
I'm going to have a baby!

150
00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:28,799
(gasps)

151
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:32,025
Aah! Bart Simpson got
a teacher pregnant!

152
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:32,791
(scoffing)

153
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:35,473
- Typical Ralph nonsense.
- (Milhouse panting)

154
00:08:35,489 --> 00:08:38,093
Bart Simpson got
a teacher pregnant!

155
00:08:38,113 --> 00:08:41,843
You happy with your
two-timing boyfriend now?

156
00:08:48,497 --> 00:08:51,203
I admit, I did make a
voodoo doll of Mrs. Trunch.

157
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:53,845
But I just asked for a
stomachache, not a baby!

158
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:56,774
Classic wish-maker's
mistake: Vague language.

159
00:08:56,794 --> 00:08:58,454
So I <i>did</i> make
her pregnant?

160
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,587
Of course not. Doesn't
work that way.

161
00:09:00,609 --> 00:09:02,515
Just how <i>do</i> women
get babies?

162
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,957
I'm not allowed to discuss
that with fourth-graders.

163
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,360
Fifth grade, you get
every dirty detail.

164
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:11,443
Do you know how embarrassed I was
to get a call at my arraignment

165
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:14,778
for my behavior during the pub
crawl because of a voodoo curse

166
00:09:14,796 --> 00:09:16,862
my son placed on
his art teacher?

167
00:09:16,884 --> 00:09:20,493
I didn't mean to make her pregnant.
I just hate art so much.

168
00:09:20,522 --> 00:09:22,267
Oh, everyone does, son.

169
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,666
That's why they lock it up in museums
where no one will ever visit.

170
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:30,303
So, uh, your boy's got magic
knock-up powers, huh?

171
00:09:30,385 --> 00:09:34,394
Hey, I created three kids, and no
one's making a big deal of that.

172
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:37,660
Not true! Whenever I compliment
your virility, you act all weird.

173
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:39,987
And you are <i>very</i> virile.

174
00:09:40,015 --> 00:09:43,502
- Uh, yeah. Just talk about sports!
- No problem.

175
00:09:43,522 --> 00:09:45,806
Wish I had that Tom
Brady's libido.

176
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:47,306
(shudders)

177
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:52,223
Oh, it's amazing how many Cheerios
Maggie drops in the back seat.

178
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:56,615
Here you go. Put those in the trash, then
you can help me unload the dishwasher.

179
00:09:56,635 --> 00:09:59,861
Oh! A minute of fun,
a lifetime of work.

180
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:02,121
I've never heard of a
pregnancy like this.

181
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:04,489
- There he is.
- Jenny, this is crazy.

182
00:10:04,506 --> 00:10:06,419
Nothing's crazy
at this point.

183
00:10:06,441 --> 00:10:08,768
Are you the boy
that makes babies?

184
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:11,736
I like to think I'm the
boy that makes families.

185
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,853
You see, Jenny?
He's just a jerk kid.

186
00:10:13,872 --> 00:10:15,613
It's just... (sobs)

187
00:10:15,643 --> 00:10:18,236
we've been trying so
hard to start a family.

188
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:20,619
With all the money
we've spent on IVF...

189
00:10:20,642 --> 00:10:21,326
(sobs)

190
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:23,024
You have no idea!

191
00:10:23,045 --> 00:10:26,005
Hmm, maybe I can help.
But it'll cost you.

192
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:27,801
- How much?
- Five dollars.

193
00:10:27,822 --> 00:10:29,935
Plus one dollar
haw-haw insurance.

194
00:10:29,955 --> 00:10:32,313
Trust me, the insurance
is worth it.

195
00:10:34,942 --> 00:10:39,463
By the power of this place,
make a baby with a face.

196
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:42,849
That's great, really. Really glad we're
getting a baby with a face. Thank you.

197
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:44,990
(tires screech)

198
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,423
- Haw...!
- No haw-haw! It worked!

199
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:48,316
(groans)

200
00:10:48,336 --> 00:10:49,676
I'm pregnant!

201
00:10:49,689 --> 00:10:52,369
Look, Bart, I really, I can't
believe there's a connection here.

202
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:55,956
But, uh, we have some friends who are
in the same dark place that we were.

203
00:10:55,982 --> 00:10:59,056
- Can we give them your name?
- Only if they have five dollars.

204
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:01,800
Yes, right. I'll make sure
that they have five dollars.

205
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:02,963
<i>With</i> them.

206
00:11:02,983 --> 00:11:05,931
Look, I'm sorry our check bounced, man.
I can have the bank teller call you.

207
00:11:05,953 --> 00:11:09,056
Just give me the cash and you'll
get your driver's license back.

208
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:14,335
Please keep the chatter down while the
Womb Wizard is casting his spells.

209
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:16,656
Ones are
appreciated, people.

210
00:11:18,353 --> 00:11:20,996
Barbeque sauce and
teddy bear's eye.

211
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:23,899
They want a baby,
God knows why.

212
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:28,161
Homie, I can't
find my spatula.

213
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:29,368
Can you get another one?

214
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,848
Flanders, can we
borrow your spatula?

215
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:33,553
That was my spatula.

216
00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:35,481
And you never bought
a replacement?

217
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:38,724
Ah, too much aggravation.
We just forego flipped food.

218
00:11:38,746 --> 00:11:39,746
D'oh!

219
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:41,681
(grunts)

220
00:11:41,756 --> 00:11:43,056
- Hmm.
- (humming a tune)

221
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:44,684
- Bart?
- Huh?

222
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,546
Why, you little...!

223
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:48,776
I'll teach you to answer
peoples' prayers!

224
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,811
(both grunting)

225
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:57,798
Yeah, you know, I just don't think we're
going to get in to see him today.

226
00:11:59,748 --> 00:12:02,115
What is your problem, boy?

227
00:12:02,135 --> 00:12:04,468
Maybe when I've got a dad
who shows up in the morning

228
00:12:04,488 --> 00:12:06,768
with no shirt on and
rocks on his face,

229
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:09,294
it sets, I don't
know, a low bar?

230
00:12:09,307 --> 00:12:11,207
Wow, I got to take that in.

231
00:12:11,225 --> 00:12:12,865
While I do, have
some bar nuts.

232
00:12:12,878 --> 00:12:14,285
Aren't those
full of germs?

233
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:15,889
Eat the nuts!
They're your dinner!

234
00:12:15,904 --> 00:12:17,905
(guns click)

235
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:20,557
You guys are
coming with us.

236
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,917
Not so fast!

237
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:27,765
Nobody comes into my bar and
kidnaps two paying customers.

238
00:12:27,794 --> 00:12:30,860
Aw, thanks, Moe, I...
Huh?

239
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,884
I must've left my
wallet at home.

240
00:12:32,906 --> 00:12:33,946
All right, take them, take them!

241
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:36,399
Fill their pockets with corn
and toss them to the pigs.

242
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,170
Don't tell us
our business!

243
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:41,206
(sobs)

244
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:49,048
Huh? Fat Tony?

245
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:50,181
That's right...

246
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:52,435
- Fat Homer.
- Hey!

247
00:12:52,465 --> 00:12:55,364
I need your boy
to make a baby.

248
00:12:56,515 --> 00:12:58,408
Do you really need the
boy's help to make a baby?

249
00:12:58,425 --> 00:13:02,068
Just do a little of the
bunga-bunga, and the hotsie-totsie,

250
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:03,836
and the bop-bada-
bop-bada-bop.

251
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:07,155
You sound like every
doctor I've ever been to.

252
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:08,674
But it's not for me.

253
00:13:08,693 --> 00:13:10,707
It's for her.

254
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,917
Meet my filly, Cheesesteak.

255
00:13:12,932 --> 00:13:14,445
The love of my life.

256
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:16,021
(baby-talking, kissing)

257
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,188
Who has apple breath?
You has apple breath.

258
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,299
(kissing, baby-talking)

259
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:25,916
And this horse, who I
have briefly "borrowed,"

260
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:28,919
is the winner of last
year's Springfield Stakes...

261
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:30,199
Rear Admiral.

262
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:33,692
So work your magic, and
breed me a champion.

263
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:36,774
Look, Fat Tony, I don't know
what you know about voodoo,

264
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,547
but it only works on people.

265
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:40,734
Horses? That's crazy talk!

266
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:46,849
You will breed me a champion by morning or
it will be the last sunrise you ever see.

267
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:49,682
Don't over-promise, boss.
It might be overcast.

268
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,641
How'd you like a
cast over your face?

269
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:55,208
Well, as long as there
re breath holes.

270
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:57,966
You know, I'm just saying.

271
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:02,247
Okay, boy, if there ever was
a good time for you to find out

272
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:05,204
where babies come from in
the grossest way possible,

273
00:14:05,223 --> 00:14:07,630
with your life on the
line, this is it.

274
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:09,063
One more thing:

275
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,151
It better be a boy.

276
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:11,905
(scoffs)

277
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,337
Anything else?

278
00:14:13,357 --> 00:14:15,414
It would be helpful if
he could go undercover

279
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:18,259
with police horses and
find out what they know.

280
00:14:23,223 --> 00:14:25,524
(crickets trilling)

281
00:14:26,475 --> 00:14:29,491
- Hey, this is all your fault.
- How is it my fault?

282
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:32,179
I wouldn't be here if you
were more of a role model.

283
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:34,923
Pub crawls, naked
Frisbee golf...

284
00:14:34,938 --> 00:14:38,985
I just did that because it was
a series of funny words.

285
00:14:38,998 --> 00:14:42,912
Well, it's your mediocre fathering
that put me on the path to hell!

286
00:14:42,931 --> 00:14:43,784
Wha...?

287
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:46,922
Maybe you're right, boy. It's
time I was a better father.

288
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,937
And I'll start
by saving us.

289
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:52,809
I just need to facilitate
some horse intercourse.

290
00:14:52,828 --> 00:14:54,348
Come on, buddy.

291
00:14:54,374 --> 00:14:57,568
Just make a champion thoroughbred,
and we're out of here.

292
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:58,980
(neighs)

293
00:15:00,222 --> 00:15:01,669
