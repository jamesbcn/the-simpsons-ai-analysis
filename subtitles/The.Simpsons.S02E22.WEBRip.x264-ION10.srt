{\an8}distinguished guests,
I am pleased to dedicate

14
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,050
{\an8}this emergency warning system.

15
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,470
{\an8}In the off-chance

16
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,390
{\an8}this sign will tell you,

00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,100
{\an8}what to do.

00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,191
{\an8}HOMER:
The joke's on them.

00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,646
{\an8}If the core explodes,

20
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:56,657
{\an8}there won't be any power

00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:00,621
And now, I would like to present
the man who made this sign possible

22
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:04,583
by dropping the last of his
obstructionist legal challenges,

23

Montgomery Burns.

24
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,255
Mr. Burns is never late.

25
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,418
Something must be
terribly wrong.

26
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:16,387
{\an8}There better be. Nobody leaves
Diamond Joe Quimby holding the bag.

00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,679
(gasping)
Must turn over.

28
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:23,644
Got to greet dignitaries.

29
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,306
Oh, no! Mr. Burns!
We've got to get a doctor.

30
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,106
Absolutely not.
No quack Sawbone's is

31
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,400
going to apply
his leeches to me.

32
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,395
As long as there's
an ounce of strength

33
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,407
-left in me, I--
-(body thuds)

34
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,160
Mmm.

35
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,412
Mr. Burns is suffering

36
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,164
from what we medical men
call hypohemia.

37
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,667
In laymen's terms, it's quite
simply a lack of blood.

38
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,459
Damn it, doctor, I'm no idiot.
I know what hypohemia is.

39
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,253
What I want to know is
what can we do about it?

40
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,416
Well, at this point,
our only hope is a transfusion.

41
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,046
How long does it take
to sterilize a needle?

42
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,633
-A few seconds.
-Oh, skip it!

43
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,428
Just leave me enough
to get home.

44
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,471
(chuckling)
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

45
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,346
His blood type
is double-o-negative.

46
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,644
-It's quite rare.
-But I'm b-positive.

47
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,688
Damn my common gutter-blood
in my veins.

48
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,821
Smithers, don't feel so bad.

49
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,439
After all, the kidney
you donated to me

50
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,107
really hit the spot.

51
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,776
SMITHERS:
<i>Attention all employees!</i>

52
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,286
<i>Our boss and inspiration,</i>
<i>Mr. Burns,</i>

53
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,998
<i>is at death's... death's door.</i>

00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,169
-(scoffs)
<i>-If you have type double-o-negative blood</i>

55
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,709
<i>I implore you to report</i>
<i>to the Bloodmobile outside.</i>

56
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,423
<i>That is all.</i>

57
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,263
I'd give him my blood
except for one thing.

58
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,919
-What's that?
-I don't want to.

59
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,297
-(laughing)
-I can't believe you guys.

60
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,595
There's a human being
out there

61
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,019
with millions of dollars
who needs our help,

62
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,098
and you don't want
to cash in?

63
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,564
That's why you losers are stuck
in this crummy dead-end job.

64
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,186
-You know, Homer, I am your supervisor.
-Sorry, sir.

65
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,233
Maggie, look.
What's that?

66
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,647
Lee-mur.

67
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,315
Lee-mur. Zebu.

68
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,994
-Zeee-booo.
-What are you doing, honey?

69
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,615
I'm trying to teach Maggie that nature
doesn't end with the barnyard.

70
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,412
I want her to have all the
advantages that I didn't have.

71
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:11,247
Lisa, we did the best we could.
What's a zebu?

72
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,964
It's like an ox, only it has
a hump and a dewlap.

73
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,625
Hump and dewlap.
Hump and dewlap.

74
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,255
-Marge! What's my blood type?
-A-positive.

75
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,223
Aw, nuts! Extremely rare blood,
and I don't have it.

76
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:26,644
You know his blood type?
How romantic.

77
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,394
A mother knows everything
about her family.

78
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,396
-Oh, yeah? What's my shoe size?
-4-B.

79
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,608
-How many teeth do I have?
-16 permanent, eight baby.

80
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,069
-Earmuffs?
-XL.

81
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,318
-Ring?
-I don't want you wearing rings.

82
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,440
It looks cheap. But three.

83
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,066
-Allergies?
-Butterscotch

84
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,902
-and imitation butterscotch.
-And?

85
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,238
-Glow-in-the-dark monster makeup.
-Ooh, impressive.

86
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,583
How many hairs on my head?
Without looking.

87
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,489
Oh, Homey, you have
lots of hair.

88
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,497
Why did you want to know
your blood type?

89
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,539
Old man Burns is gonna
kick off if he doesn't get some

90
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,834
double-o-negative blood,

91
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,377
but nobody at the plant has it.

92
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,210
-Bart does.
-Whoa! Yes! All right! Whoo!

93
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,127
Congratulations, boy!

94
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,255
You've got a date
with a needle.

95
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,392
Hey, wait a minute.
I don't have to give blood.

96
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,759
I have rights, you know.

97
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,636
Yeah, you have the right
to remain silent.

98
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,773
Bart, you have to help
someone in need.

99
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,810
-It's the only decent thing to do.
-D'oh!

100
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:15,694
Bart, it's not like I'm asking you
to give blood for free.

101
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:19,283
That would be crazy. You're a little
young to understand this,

102
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,570
but when you save
a rich man's life,

103
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,324
he showers you with riches!

104
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,906
Don't you know the story
of Hercules and the lion?

105
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,622
-Is it a Bible story?
-Yeah probably.

106
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,662
Anyway, once upon a time,

107
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:34,286
there was a big, mean lion
who got a thorn in his paw,

108
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,785
and all the village people
tried to pull it out,

109
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,458
but nobody was strong enough.

110
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,087
So, they got Hercules.

111
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,974
And Hercules used
his mighty strength

112
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,801
and bingo!

113
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:48,136
Anyway, the moral is
the lion was so happy

114
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:51,642
he gave Hercules
this big thing of riches.

115
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,436
How did a lion get rich?

116
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,399
-It was the olden days.
-Oh.

117
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,190
Hey! Let's go!

118
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,645
Emergency!
Life or death here!

119
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,106
-Just a sec, man.
-Whoa, Otto, man.

120
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,737
-You work here?
-Oh, yeah.

121
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,783
During the day,
all my friends are in school,

122
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,237
so I got a job as a certified
bloodletting tech dude.

123
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,908
Now, let's get this
show on the road.

124
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,326
Okay. Let me wash up.

125
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,625

126
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,880
Homer, brave young Bart...

127
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,762
I don't know
which one to hug first.

128
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,589
Uh, the boy.

129
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,684
-Eww.
-(tires screeching)

130
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,176

00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,146
-Oop!
-(bell dings)

132
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,729
We're ready with
the transfusion.

133
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,487
Smithers,
I'm not going to make it.

134
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,449
I want to dictate my epitaph.

135
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:50,121
-Go ahead.
-Charles Montgomery Burns...

136
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,331
-Mm-hmm.
-American...

137
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,712
-Mm-hmm.
-And a patriot American...

138
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,080
Patriot...

139
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,003
Master of the atom...

140
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,467
Scourge of the despot.

141
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,599
Oh, tyrant,
hear his mighty name and quake!

142
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,640
Smithers! I'm back!

143
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,643
BURNS:
Top of the morning to you.

144
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,635
Why, look who's here.

145
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,937
It's... good old... you.

146
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,691
Hi, Mr. Burns.

147
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,363
Oh! Hey, there, Mister...

148
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,783
Brownshoes.

149
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,901
How about that local
sports team?

150
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,488
Mr. Burns-- he's okay.

151
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,204
-Jackpot!
-(glass breaking)

152
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,000
Ay caramba!

153
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,290
(laughing)
Well, that's game.

154
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,634
Hasta mañana, Oswaldo.

155
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,590
Smithers, I'm back in the pink--

156
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,670
full of pith and vinegar.

157
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,335
Just remarkable, sir.

158
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,264
You know, it's funny, Smithers.

159
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:51,642
I tried every tincture
and poultice and tonic

160
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,721
and patent medicine there is,

161
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:57,686
and all I really needed was
the blood of a young boy.

162
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,858
-By the way, what was the lad's name?
-Bart Simpson, sir.

163
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,608
-Who?
-He's the son of Homer Simpson,

164
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,280
one of your stiffs
in sector 7-G.

165
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,818
Well, the Simpsons
will be getting

166
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,283
a very nice surprise
in the mail.

167
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,283
Very nice, indeed.
(fiendish laugh)

168
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,156
Bill, bill...

169
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,623
summons, bill...

170
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,663
(gasps)

171
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,956
Wait a minute.

172
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,119
From C.M. Burns.
This is it.

173
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,788
Yes, this is it!

174
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:22,876
Woo-hoo! Whoo!

175
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,000
Bart, Lisa, Maggie!

176
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,627
Let's do this out in the yard
where the neighbors can see.

177
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,045
Lisa, dim the lights.

178
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,893
No! turn on more lights.
Do something.

179
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,388
Yes, Dad.

180
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,308
It's a little thin,
but that's okay.

181
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,730
It could be a check.

182
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,768
Alright, there's no check.

183
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,352
Just a card,
but don't panic.

184
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,017
I'm sure it tells us
what we're getting

185
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,896
and where we can pick it up.

186
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:49,033
"Dear Bart,
Thank you kindly for the blood.

187
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,071
Yours truly, Montgomery Burns."

188
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,866
D'oh! It's just a card!

189
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,745
Is that some way
to show your gratitude?

190
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,211
No gold, no diamonds,
no jewelry...

191
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,962
not even a lousy card.

192
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,964
Wait a minute.
There was a card.

193
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,706
That's what got me so mad
in the first place!

194
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,298
You don't do things like that
to be rewarded.

195
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,014
You do them because a fellow
human being needs a helping hand.

196
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,715
Marge, you're my wife
and I love you very much,

197
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:20,136
but you're living
in a world of make-believe

198
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,306
with flowers and bells
and leprechauns

199
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,265
and magic frogs
with funny little hats.

200
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,145
-Yeah, Mom, we got hosed.
-Bart!

201
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,732
We got exactly what we wanted
out of this!

202
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,698
We gave an old man
a second chance.

203
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,569
I promised my boy
one simple thing:

204
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,237
lots of riches

205
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,195
and that man broke my promise.

206
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,246
Well I've had it!

207
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,658
Bart, take a letter!

208
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,786
Dear Mr. Burns

209
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:47,423
I'm so glad
you enjoyed my son's blood

210
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,723
and your card was just great.

211
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:54,298
In case you can't tell,
I'm being sarcastic.

212
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,505
You stink!

213
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,506
Could you read that
last part back to me?

214
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,058
-"You stink!"
-(chuckles) Good.

215
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,692
You are a senile,
buck-toothed old mummy

216
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,440
with bony girl arms,
and you smell like...

217
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,034
An elephant's butt?

218
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,859
(laughs)
An elephant's butt.

219
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,025
But he's your boss. Do you have to
mail it right this minute?

220
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,025
Yup.

221
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,366
You're still angry, Homer.
Why don't you sleep on it?

222
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:23,002
-Forget it, Marge.
-Please, Homey?

223
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,670
For me?

224
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,339
Oh, all right.

225
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,170
You always do
that hand thing,

226
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,506
and it usually works.

227
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,392
Cheap son of a...

228
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,049
(snoring)

229
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,396
Ooh, pancakes.

230
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,981
Ooh.

231
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,737
Homer, breakfast is ready.

232
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,609
Hmm?
(gags)

233
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,446
Marge, you saved me

234
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,031
from making a big mistake.

235
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,986
You know, I finally understand
the meaning of...

236
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,158
-(unintelligible)
-Meaning of what?

237
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,616
Better half, Marge.
Better half.

238
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,786
-Oh, thank you.
-Where's the letter?

239
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,585
(whistling)

240
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,299
-Where is it?
-(cans clattering)

241
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,256
Oh...

242
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,426
Homer, I don't think it's
in the cornstarch canister.

243
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,846
Well, it's somewhere.

244
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,944
It didn't just get up
and walk away.

245
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,519
-(whistling)
-Bart, have you seen the letter?

246
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,355
-Yep.
-All right, think very carefully.

247
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,531
Where did you see it last?

248
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,531
-The last place I saw it--
-Uh-huh?

249
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,164
-...was in my hand.
-Yeah?

250
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,952
As I was shoving it

251
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,115
into the mailbox.

252
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,374
HOMER:
D'oh!

253
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,665
Why did you do that?

254
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:52,459
Dad, there were things in the letter
that had to be said.

255
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,545
And I know you.
You're an emotional guy.

256
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,471
Just because you were mad
last night

257
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,180
is no guarantee
you'd be mad in the morning.

258
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,100
I'll show you mad
in the morning!

259
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,219
Homer, you encouraged him.

260
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,306
You should be strangling
yourself.

261
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,482
She's right.

262
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,522
Okay, think, Homer.
Don't panic.

263
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,015
They don't pick up the mail
till noon.

264
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,687
-There's still time!
-(gasps)

265
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,275
Ow, ow.

266
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,950
Ow, ow.
Ow, ow.

267
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,699
Give it up, Homer.
It's locked up tight.

268
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,661
Locked, eh?

269
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,122
Well, I just might
have a little surprise

270
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:28,082
up my sleeve
for old Mr. Lock.

271
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,584
Step aside, boy.

272
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,709
Hey!

273
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,086
I'm with you, Homer.

274
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,343
Fight the power!

275
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,764
-Why the hose, Homer?
-What does it look like?

276
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,677
I'll get our letter so wet,

277
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,266
the ink will run, and no one
will be able to read it.

278
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,021
Yeah, but don't other people
have mail in there?

279
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,233
So a few people won't get
a few letters. Boo-hoo.

280
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,105
You know the kind of letters
people write:

281
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,192
"Dear somebody
you never heard of--

282
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,607
"How is so and so?

283
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,945
"Blah, blah, blah.

284
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,700
Yours truly, some bozo."
Big loss.

285
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,703
Now, Bart, you keep an eye out
for the mailman.

286
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,036
Just give me some kinda signal.

287
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,921
-Dad, the mailman's here.
-That's a good one. We'll use that.

288
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,458
-No, I mean the mailman's here!
-(screams)

289
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,802
Dear God! Are you planning
to water the mail?

290
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,338
I guess it wouldn't do
any good to run,

291
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,512
'cause you're a mail lady and you know
my name and address and everything, huh?

292
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:25,602
-That's right.
-Well, I'm still going to run!

293
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,309
I want the whole world
to hear the story

294
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,980
of my harrowing struggle
with hypohemia.

295
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,190
Sir, Mr. Roman is one of the finest
ghostwriters in the business.

296
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,231
He's written
<i>Like Hell I Can't,</i>

297
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,775
<i>Up From the Muck,</i>

298
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,318
<i>The Unsinkable</i>
<i>Sadruodin Mahbaradad.</i>

299
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,661
-Excellent.
-All right, first question.

300
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,198
Have you slept
with anyone famous?

301
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,332
Well, Countess Von Zeppelin
and I...

302
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,949
What in blaze!

303
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:52,206
Now you listen to me,
you bargain-basement Baudelaire.

304
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,079
I'm not some dizzy starlet

305
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,036
who can't string
two words together.

306
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,796
I can write this thing myself!

307
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,508
You're fired!

308
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,808
(imitating Mr. Burns)
Hello. My name is Mr. Burns.

309
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,308
I believe you have
a letter for me.

310
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,021
Okay, Mr. Burns,
what's your first name?

311
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,062
I don't know.

312
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,225
Great plan, Bart.

313
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,895
Ooh, look, Maggie.

314
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,194
What is that?

315
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:25,237
Dodecahedron. Dodecahedron.

316
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,742
Lisa, I don't know
what you're doing

317
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,285
but it's very strange, and your father's
trying to worry.

318
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,869
BURNS:
<i>Chapter the fifth--</i>

319
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:36,785
<i>the trip to the infirmary</i>
<i>with most unexpected results.</i>

320
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,839
HOMER: Oops. 28 minutes
till Burns comes in.

321
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,264
Time for operation
"Mail Take."

322
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,137
-Can I help you?
-(shrieks)

323
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,725
Oh, don't be frightened
of this.

324
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,440
It's nothing but a letter opener.
Who are you?

325
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,151
<i>Don't tell him. </i>
<i>Give him a fake name.</i>

326
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,771
-Homer Simpson.
<i>-D'oh!</i>

327
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,438
Simpson, huh?

328
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,986
Simpson, why there's
a letter here from you.

329
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,240
I'll just read it right now.

330
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,783
"Dear Mr. Burns, I'm so glad
you enjoyed my son's blood,

331
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,118
and your card was just great."

332
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:17,833
Why, Simpson,
you've made my day.

333
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,997
You're a true gentleman.

334
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,255
-Well, I'll be on my--
-Hello, there's more.

335
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,089
"In case you can't tell,
I'm being sarcastic.

336
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,966
"You stink.

337
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,643
"You are a senile

338
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,601
"buck-toothed old mummy
with bony girl arms,

339
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:37,482
-and you smell like an elephant's butt."
-(nervous chuckle)

340
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,401
Hey! Come on, Joey,
you have to twist my arm?

341
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,151
Homer, I don't tell you how
to do your job, okay?

342
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:47,533
I could crush him like an ant,
but it would be too easy.

343
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,993
No, revenge is a dish
best served cold.

344
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,535
I'll bide my time until...

345
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,579
Oh, what the hell.

346
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,413
I'll just crush him like an ant.

347
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,881
Senile, eh?
Buck-toothed, am I?

348
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,634
Bony arms, are they?
Liver spots, did I?

349
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,347
-Shameless, will you?
-His pink slip awaits your signature, sir.

350
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,098
Hmm-hmm-hmm.

351
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,930
Now that's odd.

352
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,305
I've just robbed a man
of his livelihood,

353
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,983
and yet I feel
strangely empty.

354
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,152
Tell you what, Smithers,
have him beaten to a pulp.

355
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,482
-But, sir--
-But what?

356
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,106
Nothing, sir.

357
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,203
I've never seen
Mr. Burns this mad,

358
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,948
and he's always
kind of mad.

359
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:34,080
-(groans)
-Me and my big letter-writing pen.

360
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,039
Honey, what's done is done.

361
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,210
No matter what happens,
we'll pull through.

362
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,288
-We always do.
-Okay, here's the plan.

363
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,714
You can move in with your sisters
and raise the kids,

364
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,133
and I'll die in a gutter.

365
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,212
It's practical
and within our means.

366
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,427
(sobs)

367
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,968
They always told me I was
going to destroy the family,

368
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,682
but I never believed it.

369
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:54,762
That's okay, Bart.

370
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,137
Nobody really believed it.

371
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,773
We were just trying
to scare you.

372
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,687
-You know Homer Simpson?
-Yeah, nice guy.

373
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,191
Play poker with him
once in awhile.

374
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,153
Mm-hmm.
We, um, need him beaten up.

375
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,694
-You got it.
-Wait.

376
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,817
- What is it?
- Uh... nothing.

377
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,365
-Wait.
-What?

378
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,779
Beat, but don't kick.

379
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,868
-Hold the kicks. Got it.
-Wait.

380
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:21,213
-What?
-Um...

381
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,040
What did Homey do, anyway?

382
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:27,875
(sobbing)
He saved Mr. Burns's life.

383
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,803
(thunder rumbling)

384
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,972
<i>In closing, gentle reader,</i>
<i>I'd like to thank you.</i>

385
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,932
<i>What's that you say?</i>

386
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,262
<i>Me thanking you?</i>

387
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,346
<i>No, it's not a misprint.</i>

388
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,522
<i>For you see,</i>
<i>I enjoyed writing this book</i>

389
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,902
<i>as much as you</i>
<i>enjoyed reading it.</i>

390
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,399
<i>The End.</i>

391
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,152
Ah, Smithers,
how did the beating go?

392
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,784
Sir, there was no beating.

393
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,071
What? Well that's a hell
of a thing. Why?

394
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,275
-Because I-- I called it off.
-Judas!

395
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,576
I'm sorry, sir, but I just
couldn't hurt Homer Simpson.

396
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,461
-He saved your life.
-I see.

397
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,118
I know you're mad at me,

398
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,957
but I think it's only fair
to warn you,

399
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,922
I'm going to stand outside
the gate until you forgive me.

400
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,882
No need, Smithers.

401
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,092
As usual,
you've been the sober ying

402
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:14,053
to my raging yang.

403
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:18,064
-Put her there, old pal.
-(sniffles)

404
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:22,388
(sniffling) Sir, while I wish
this handshake would never end,

405
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,976
I'm afraid we still have
the Simpson matter to attend to.

406
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,523
We do indeed, old friend.

407
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,436
We do, indeed.

408
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,606
MOE: Moe's Tavern,
where the elite meet to drink.

409
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,204
BART: <i>Uh, yeah.</i>
<i>Hello, is Mike there?</i>

410
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,779
<i>Last name Rotch.</i>

411
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,164
Hold on, I'll check.

412
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,831
Mike Rotch! Mike Rotch?

413
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,830
Hey, has anybody seen
Mike Rotch lately?

414
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,252
(laughing)

415
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,540
Listen to me, you little puke.

416
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,754
One of these days
I'm going to catch you,

417
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,045
and I'm gonna carve my name
on your back with an ice pick!

418
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,049
(laughing)

419
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,470
What's the matter, Homer?

420
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,340
You're not your normal
effervescent self.

421
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,846
I've got my problems, Moe.
Give me another one.

422
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,809
Homer, hey, you should not drink
to forget your problems.

423
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,100
Yeah, you should always drink to
enhance your social skills. (burping)

424
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,226
BURNS: We'll get the Simpsons
a present--

425
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,113
an extravagant present.

426
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,570
A mad, unthinkable,
utterly impossible present.

427
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,202
A frabulous, grabulous,
zip-zoop zabulous present.

428
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,241
Too practical.

429
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,704
Too cutesie-poo.

430
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,748
-♪♪
-Too cornball.

431
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,843
A pool table?
Are you mad?

432
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,959
I'm not going to turn
his home into a saloon.

433
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,506
Eureka! We've found it.

434
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,551
But, sir, it's $32,000.

435
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:41,854
Don't you dare sully this moment
with your price taggery.

436
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,140
It's perfect.

437
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,853
Oh, woe is me.

438
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,774
Oh, my, it's Mr. Burns.

439
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,234
(yelps)

440
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,274
Heave-ho, heave-ho.

441
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,817
-Heave-ho.
-Wait, Dad, he's smiling.

442
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:59,283
Mr. Burns,
you brought us a present.

443
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,334
What did you think
I was going to do,

444
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:05,118
-have you beaten to a bloody pulp?
-(chuckles)

445
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,874
To show there's
no hard feelings,

446
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,705
please take an advance copy
of my book.

447
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,745
And now young fellow,
I haven't forgotten you.

448
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,167
-Here.
-Wow! A crowbar.

449
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,126
It's to open the crate, stupid.

450
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,888
What did I tell you?

451
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,060
I'll bet it's filled with diamonds,
rubies, sapphires, pearls.

452
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,232
BART:
Wow!

453
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,190
-A big, ugly head.
-D'oh!

454
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,690
Actually, son, it's a big,
ugly, Olmec Indian head.

455
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:37,034
It was carved by Mesoamerican
Indians over 3,000 years ago.

456
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,950
This gruesome customer

457
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,319
is Ixtapolapoquetl--
the god of war.

458
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,236
Awesome!

459
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,905
No, Maggie, not Aztec.

460
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,583
Olmec. Olmec.

461
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,713
Marge, what does it do?

462
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,919
It doesn't do anything.

463
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,078
Marge, really,
what does it do?

464
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,377
Whatever it does,
it's doing it now.

465
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,381
Well, I'll let you
get acquainted

466
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,173
with Señor Ixtapolapoquetl.

467
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,507
Ta!

468
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,931
Did you see their faces,
Smithers?

469
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,719
Sir, you're my god
of generosity.

470
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,394
HOMER: Save a guy's life
and what do you get?

471
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,643
Nothing. Worse than nothing--

472
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,136
Just a big, scary rock.

473
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,268
Hey, man,
don't badmouth the head.

474
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,145
Homer, it's the thought
that counts.

475
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,822
The moral of this story is,

476
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,070
a good deed is
its own reward.

477
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:22,242
Hey, we got a reward.
The head is cool.

478
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:25,832
Well, then I guess the moral is:
no good deed goes unrewarded.

479
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:29,159
Wait a minute!
If I hadn't written that nasty letter

480
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,746
we wouldn't have
gotten anything.

481
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,172
Well, then I guess
the moral is:

482
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,841
the squeaky wheel
gets the grease.

483
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,130
Perhaps there is
no moral to this story.

484
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,804
Exactly.

485
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,842
It's just a bunch of stuff
that happened.

486
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,346
But it certainly was
a memorable few days.

487
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,929
HOMER:
Amen to that.

488
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,724
