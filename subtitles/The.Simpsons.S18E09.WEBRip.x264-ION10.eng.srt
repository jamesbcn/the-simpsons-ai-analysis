Now Smithers,
I need your advice

picking out a gift
for a very dear friend of mine.

91
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,071
A single fellow,
a bit quiet,

92
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,413
but one with a warm,
loyal heart.

93
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,239
Well, sir,
a fellow like that

94
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,244
might have had his eye
on this silver frame.

95
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,617
It would go great with his
collection of Art Deco...

96
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,825
Shut up, shut up!
There he is.

97
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,035
Hello, Phillip.

98
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,575

doing here?

100
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,171
Oh-ho. Never you
mind, Mr. Nosey.

00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,256
(both laughing)

102
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,260
Are you going
to that string quartet thing?

103
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,102
-’Cause I’m not.
-(both laughing)

104
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,178
(sotto voce)
Are you still here?

105
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,103
Go pay for that.

106
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,268
Well, uh...

107
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:14,272
what can ol’ Santa bring you
for Christmas, son?

108
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,475
I want a dirt bike,

109
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,145
one of those video game
chairs that vibrate...

110
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,864
Dad, he’s not
the real Santa.

111
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,855
We can’t afford
that stuff.

112
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,077
Shut up.
Shut up. Shut up!

(sobbing)

114
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,910
I better go
after him.

115
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,325
What can I do for you,
young lady?

116
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,996
What I want
can’t be bought at any store.

117
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,546
Oh, what is it, sweetie?

118
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,919
Peace on earth?

119
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,296
What? No!

120
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,302
I-I mean,
that’s a given.

121
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,514
But also, the Malibu Stacy
Pony Beach Party Set

122
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,306
with Sparkle Sand.

123
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,269
It’s sold out
everywhere.

124
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,732
You know,

125
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,685
Santa thinks he saw an
extra Beach Party Set

126
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,487
sitting back
in the stockroom there.

127
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,110

128
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,277

Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

132
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,048
You really made my
daughter’s Christmas.

133
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,799
Well, her smile
made mine.

134
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,343
Gil!

135
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,386
March your fake boot
fronts over here!

136
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,351
Mr. Costington!

137
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,351
Sir, I’m glad I have
this chance to talk to you.

138
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,353
I’ve been on the payroll
here since May,

139
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,555
and I’d really like
to start working
in Ladies Shoes.

140
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,976
Not literally,
of course.

141
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,574
I... I couldn’t walk
very fast,

142
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,939
though I’d learn
if that’s what it takes.

143
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,315
Never mind that now!

144
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,902
Did you sell
the Malibu Stacy set
I put aside?

145
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,737
That was for you?

146
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,034
It was
for my daughter!

147
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,748
You nitwit!

148
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,040
I want my dolly!

149
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,464
(jowly)
You nitwit!

150
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,213
Now get back
that toy.

151
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,666
Gee, I’m sorry, sir.

152
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,677
Taking back that
doll would break

153
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,299
a little girl’s heart
on Christmas Eve.

154
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:13,887
I made a lot
of mistakes in my life,
but I would never do that.

155
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:17,395
Well, then, you’re...
fired!

156
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,308
But I...

157
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,976

Aw.

158
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,573
Oh, you poor man.

Why don’t you have dinner
with us tonight?

162
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,792
Please, Santa?

163
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,660
Well, let me check
the bus schedule here.

164
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,917
If I get it...
make a transfer there.

165
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,960
Well, I could be there

166
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:40,962
by 2:00 a.m.

167
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,383
We’ll give you a ride.

168
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,382
That’s swell.

169
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,633
Could you swing
by my ex-wife’s place?

170
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,295
I want her to see me

00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,609
You can’t go
home tonight.

179
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,487
It’s cold.
It’s late.

180
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,244
Yeah, maybe I should
spend the night here, too.

181
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,827
You’re getting
a cab, old man.

182
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,832
In fact, I believe
I see it now.

183
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,124
But I haven’t given you
a present.

184
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,668
Your present
is leaving.

185
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,382
Oh, I don’t see
a cab.

186
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,883
Well, since I’m staying,
how about another song?

187
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:32,006
♪ Jazzin’ around
the Christmas tree ♪

188
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,314
♪ It’s a skit skat holiday. ♪

189
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,599
LISA & BART:
It’s Christmas!

190
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,562
-It’s Christmas!
-It’s Christmas!

191
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,733
I didn’t think it would
ever come, but it did!

192
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,271
(both laughing)

193
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,280
What is all this?

194
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,439
Well, I figured since
you invited me to stay,

195
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,448
I might as well go down
to the bus locker

196
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,860
and get my stuff.

197
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,068
Oh.

198
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:56,077
Marge, we have
a problem here.

199
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,080
You have a bigger
problem out there.

200
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:03,883
Grumply, grumply groo,
your blood will make my stew.

201
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,300
(whispering loudly)
Do you think that’s
the same Grumple

202
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,209
from the ice show?

203
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,587
Because I do.

204
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,046
(grunts)

205
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,222
Hey, who wants some eggs
a la Harold Stassen?

206
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,516
Huh?

207
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,350
They’re always running!

208
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,726
(Gil laughs)

209
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,943
(Lisa laughs)

210
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,483
(whispering)
Do you really understand
what that means?

211
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,068
(chuckles)
Kinda.

212
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,906
Why did you let that loser
into our home?

213
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,489
I’ll tell you why:
Christian Charity.

214
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,905
Christian Charity?

215
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,953
What does a porn star have
to do with this?

216
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,116
He’s gotta go.

217
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,754
I promise you
he’ll leave after today.

218
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:43,922
Really?
Who’s gonna make him?

219
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I will.

220
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,094
He sure has a lot of markers
that don’t work.

221
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,757
Well, I got something.

222
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,386
Gah! A spider bite,

223
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,642
or as I like to call it,
a "Christmas kiss."

224
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,725
Listen, uh, Gil...

225
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,191
I sort of
thought that...

226
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,572
you know, you’d be
on your way by now.

227
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,729
Really?

228
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,647
You’re gonna put me out
on Christmas Day, huh?

229
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,027
(chuckles)

230
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,164
Well, that’s all right.

231
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,950
I can go down
to the men’s shelter.

232
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,044
I just hope that weird priest
with the runny eye

233
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,619
ain’t serving soup,
’cause they...

234
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,785
Wait, you don’t have
a place to live?

235
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,634
(whispering loudly)
Lower the boom.

236
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,749
(sighs)

237
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,745
I guess you don’t
have to leave

238
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,377
till the holiday’s over.

239
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,007
(grunts worriedly)

240
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,301
(whispering loudly)
Has the boom
been lowered?

241
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,345
No!

242
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,679
(whispering loudly)
D’oh...

243
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,232
<i>TV ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i>Appearing in their</i>

244
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,020

245
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,824

<i>from </i>Batman Begins.

246
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,569
Hey-ya, Marge,
Happy New Year.

247
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,401
You make
any resolutions?

248
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,396
Yes. One...
involving you.

249
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,818
What a coincidence!

250
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,156
I made one, too.

251
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,200
I’m gonna move
my fanny off this sofa.

252
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,584
(gasps)
Oh.

253
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,001
And move it over to that
recliner by the phone

254
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,000
’cause I’m expecting
a call any minute now

255
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,002
from my old boss
at Jackpot Realty,

256
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,594
asking me to take over
the Scottsdale office.

257
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,800
Really?

258
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,629
Oh, yeah. That desert air’s
gonna give the ol’ one-two

259
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:15,965
to my bronchitis.

260
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,140
(chuckles)
(coughing)

261
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,272
Oh... boy.

262
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,139
(sighs)

263
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,845
I guess you can stay
a little longer.

264
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,516
Ah, thank you, Marge.

265
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,067
You know, those floats
should really slow down

266
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,609
and savor it, ’cause your life
can go to Hell pretty quick.

267
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,525
(grunts)

268
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,617
We’re not keeping
that moocher

269
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,794
in this house
another minute.

270
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:47,622
(coughs)

271
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,667
He’s still in need.

272
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,539
We have to let him stay.

273
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,836
It’s what Dr. King
would want us to do.

274
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,090
Oh, that’s it.
We’re changing doctors.

275
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,512
Please,
just a few more days.

276
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,761
Marge, admit it.

277
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,303
You just can’t say
"no" to anyone.

278
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,307
That’s why you have three kids.

279
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,679
It’s true.

280
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,845
I do have trouble saying "no."

281
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,564
It all started when I was seven.

282
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,524
Marjorie,
we need you to hide our
cigarettes in your dollhouse.

283
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,687
No!

284
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:15,815
(both growling)

285
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,281
Mom?
Gramma?

286
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,664
Aunt Larina?

287
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,621
Anybody?

288
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,291
Whoa-whoa-whoa-wha--

289
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,750
Ugh.

290
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,960
And that’s why I have trouble
saying "no" to people.

291
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,542
Even Gil.

292
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,087
Marge,
I have no idea

293
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,512
what you were just
thinking about.

294
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,181
Why would you
think I did?

295
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,639
Uh... hmm.

296
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,100
(dog barks)

297
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,930
(grumbling)

298
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,346
What’sa matter,
Homer?

299
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,144
You still miss
the UPN?

300
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,647
Yeah, but there’s
something else.

301
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,059
There’s this loser staying
in our house.

302
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,518
Marge says she’s gonna
kick him out,

303
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,648
but then she never does.

304
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,244
Well, you can’t kick him out,

305
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,489
’cause then Marge will never
learn to assert herself.

306
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,121
Well, I guess I’ll have
to wait for Marge

307
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,619
to show
some backbone and--

308
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,290
You again?!

309
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,118
(growling)

310
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,035
(grunts)
Aah!

311
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,421

00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,429

Yes.

334
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,678
Yes.

335
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,227
Oh, dear.

336
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,690
I can’t tell him that!

337
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,441

I’m so sick of Gil.

376
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,316
He ruins Thanksgiving,

377
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,322
uses my leg razor
to peel his carrots...

378
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,695
Marge, I hate to
interrupt the ol’
solilo-diddly-iloquy,

379
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,282
but I just want to
thank you for your
early Christmas card.

380
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,328
Christmas card?

381
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,331
I haven’t even taken
the photo yet.

382
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,333
Isn’t this your posse
on this glossy?

383
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,037
(gasps)

384
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,340
That Photoshopping freak!

385
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,971
Oh, I don’t mean to cause
Gil ill will, but still...

386
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,178
Don’t you defend him!

387
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,719
I want that mooch out
of my house right now!

388
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,103
Marge, I’ve never seen
you like this before.

389
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:55,970
That’s right!

390
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:59,176
I just found my gumption,
and I like it!

391
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,978
Marge Simpson is gonna say no!

392
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,573
Gil! Gil?

393
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,398
Gil!

394
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,362
Gil’s gone.

395
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,572
Back to Scottsdale.

396
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,151
-Problem solved.
-End of story.

397
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,696
Can we have pancakes
for dinner?

398
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,109
Gil’s gone?

399
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,327
But I have a "no" inside me
that has to come out.

400
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,159
Hey, Marge,
you want a thousand dollars?

401
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,164
No!

402
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,325
I mean, yes!

403
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,503
Too late.

404
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,961
(groaning)

405
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,341
Don’t worry. I make
six of those a year.

406
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,427
Even though Gil left,

407
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,218
I still have
to kick him out.

408
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,562
I need this, or I’ll never
be able to say "no."

409
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,428
Mom, I understand
your psychological need,

410
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,225
but I’m not sure
what you can do.

411
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,439
I’ll tell you what.

412
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,518
We’re going
to Scottsdale!

413
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,354
Scottsdale?

414
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,148
Will we stay
at a Tripletree Resort?

415
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,151
-Sure.
-Then forget it!

416
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,001
I’ll ask these active
seniors if they know Gil.

417
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,999
I’ll have you
know I’m 32.

418
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,251
Oh!

419
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,293
(gasping)
There he is!

420
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,338
Gunderson?!

421
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,267
Whoa, Gil’s a big shot!

422
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,679
And to think he and I once
shared a shower.

423
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,268
I don’t care
how successful Gil is.

424
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,734
He’s still a mooch,
and I need to tell him off!

425
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,943
(screeching)

426
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,242
117 degrees?

427
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,744
Ooh, that reminds me.

428
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:39,866
(heavy panting)

429
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:44,462
There’s water
under the seat!

430
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,960
(whimpering)

431
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,459
Now remember, Marge,

432
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,924
we’re not buying anything
for more than 1.2,

433
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,505
but if I scratch my nose,

434
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,091
that means
we can go to 1.5.

435
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,717
People, remember,
you’re selling dreams!

436
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,098
When a family owns a home,

437
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,604
it means they own
a piece of America.

438
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,727
And what matters most
isn’t the commission you make,

439
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,685
it’s the smiles on their faces

440
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:15,065
when they know they own
that land free and clear.

441
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,494
He’s the best
I’ve ever seen.

442
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,282
He’s talking
at a Century 22 level.

443
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,826
(groans)

444
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,699
Gil, remember me?

445
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,076
Marge Simpson?
What are you doing here?

446
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,294
Lookin’ for a home
on a quiet cul-de-sac,

447
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,634
where your neighbor
could be Tanya Tucker?

448
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,093
Listen, bub.

449
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,711
I have something
to say to you,

450
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,507
and it can’t wait.

451
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,971
Oh, well, looks
like we got

452
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,970
a Backout Betty
on our hands.

453
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,972
But watch ol’ Gil take her
from furious to curious.

454
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,135
Now, ma’am, you say
you can’t wait,
and you’re right.

455
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,354
With interest rates climbing
and choice properties

456
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:50,145
in the Kingsbridge School
District drying up...

457
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,570
The only house I’m
interested in is my own,

458
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:56,109
which you defiled
for 11 hellish months.

459
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,525
But now I’ve
learned to say "no!"

460
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,994
No to your mooching!

461
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,533
No to your manipulation!

462
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:05,657
And a big fat no to the
Kingsbridge School District!

463
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,996
Aw, come on, you can’t
say no to ol’ Gil.

464
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,752
No!

465
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,131
Why, he’s as pathetic
as we are.

466
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,013
(laughing)

467
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,588
Gunderson!

468
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,175
I put you in charge
of this office

469
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,010
because I thought
you could tame this town.

470
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,176
You’re fired!

471
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,815
