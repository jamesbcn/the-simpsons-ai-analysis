{\an8}but I was too embarrassed
to admit it,

80
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,810
{\an8}so I set the house
on fire.

81
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,517
{\an8}Feels good

It’s so hard
to choose

93
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,665
just one item worthy
of the safe.

94
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,336
So I made this elaborate
decision tree,

95
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,336

of preservation.

00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,193
Bring me more
snaps like this,

182
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,856
and I’ll make you
a moderately wealthy man.

183
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,815
Moderately wealthy?

184
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:51,815
(gasps)

185
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,946
Whee! I’m sort of rich!

186
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,663
I can rent anything I want!

187
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,164
That’s quite
an offer.

188
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,536
Can I discuss it
with my wife?

189
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,462
Sure, why not?

190
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,540
Then I’ll do it!

191
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,091
Oh, boy!

192
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,382
I can’t wait
to see Krusty.

193
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,466
Look, there’s his
chauffeur-driven Town Car.

194
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:14,803
(tires screeching)

195
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:15,757
(screams)

196
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,426
Your head dinged
my door panel!

197
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,726
Jerks like you
ought to be shot!

198
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,189
Krusty!

199
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,769
How about a nice shot of you
with the boy you injured?

200
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,234
Paparazzi?!

201
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,944
Get lost,
ya parasite.

202
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,855
How about you, Gabbo?

203
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,074
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!

204
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,744
Okay, how about
an autograph for my kids?

205
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,454
Well, when you
put it that way...

206
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,374
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi

207
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,871
yi-yi-yi-yi!

208
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,254
Okay, boy, this is
that snooty supermarket

209
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,673
all the celebrities
shop at.

210
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,801
You’re gonna help
me ambush them.

211
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,918
Look at this place.

212
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,666
Imported beer?

213
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,467
Seedless grapes?

214
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,221
Chewing gum?

215
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,223
(gasps)

216
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,894
The clown on this cereal box

217
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,642
is just a person.

218
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,984
(gasps)
There’s the Rich Texan

219
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,848
and his daughter,
Paris Texan.

220
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,265
Come on, baby,
barf for mama.

221
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,364
Okay, boy,
do something annoying,

222
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,480
but leave yourself
room to build.

223
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,448
Hey, Paris,
I saw a disgusting

224
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,028
part of your body
on the Internet--

225
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,243
your face!

226
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,703
I’m still breaking
in this nose!

227
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,583
(grunting, shutter clicking)

228
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,415
(shutter clicking)

229
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,467
Look at those
celebrities.

230
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,590
I’ve met them all,

231
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,006
and yet they don’t even
acknowledge my existence.

232
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,305
Hello, Homer.

233
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,768
Have you
lost weight?

234
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,978
Oh, like you care,
Betty White.

235
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,389
Tell me,
how’s Maggie?

236
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,437
Her name is Marge!

237
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,020
I was talking
about your baby.

238
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,895
Oh. Uh, she’s
looking very... snappy!

239
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,863
Thanks for taking my picture.

240
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,323
If you want me
to sign it,

241
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,783
here’s a stamped,
self-addressed envelope.

242
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,624
And give Santa’s Little
Helper a big hug for me.

243
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,451
Yeah, that’s right,
just walk away.

244
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,544
(lisping): Beautiful day,
isn’t it, Freddie?

245
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,996
God bless you
and yours.

246
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,666
Dad, it’s
Drederick Tatum.

247
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,014
Try to get him
to punch you.

248
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,129
No problem.

249
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,925
Hey, Drederick!

250
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,298
Yes, how can I help you,
my handsome friend?

251
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:22,136
Your hip-hop CD was
boastful and unnecessary.

252
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,223
Okay, here we go.

253
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,141
-(camera shutter)
-(grunting)

254
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,979
(grunting)

255
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,863
(screams)

256
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,856
That’s what I think
of the fourth estate!

257
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,868
What are
the first three?

258
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,160
Nobility, clergy
and commoners.

259
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,254
Learn your
French history.

260
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,078
Okay.

261
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,962
Terrific! Outstanding!

262
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,461
This has page one
written all over it.

263
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,003
What the hell
did you do that for?

264
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,956
I wanted to remember my place
in the book I was reading.

265
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,513
(sneaky music)

266
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,466
Boy, I never thought
I’d have my own darkroom.

267
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,764
LISA: Yes,
but why does it

268
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,717
have to be
in my bedroom?

269
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,887
Lis, you can’t stay here
if you’re gonna keep talking.

270
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,556
It’s 11:00 at night,
and I can’t get to sleep!

271
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,265
Well, then you could
come over here

272
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,605
and help Daddy
pour chemicals.

273
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,730
(sighs)

274
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,606
Okay.

275
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,153
(sizzling)

276
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,816
(groaning)

277
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,405
Kids-- they always say
they’re not tired

278
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,451
when they’re the most
tired of all.

279
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,615
(chuckles)

280
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,168
That photo’s mine.

281
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,458
That photo’s mine.
That photo’s mine.

282
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,462
Well, I do like
the extra money.

283
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,054
But I think maybe
you should stop

284
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,589
exploiting human beings’
private misfortunes.

285
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,894
See, Marge-- everyone says
they hate these magazines,

286
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,469
but it’s impossible
to set them down.

287
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,514
Oh, it is not.

288
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,807
Watch me.

289
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,560
(groaning, grunting)

290
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,313
Ooh...

291
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,766
(stammers)

292
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,146
(screaming)

293
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,572
Sideshow Mel is
in a custody battle?!

294
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,321
(gasps)
And it’s turning bitter?

295
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,494
If you read one more thing,
it is a purchase.

296
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,743
Experts disagree on
location of Heaven?

297
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,735
Purchase!

298
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,736
(register beeps)

299
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,077
(triumphant brass music)

300
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,747
Okay, this is the place.

301
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,705
(wind rushing)

302
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,797
Did I attach
the harness?!

303
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:21,803
No!

304
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,009
Should attach it
for you?!

305
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,476
If you don’t
mind...!

306
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,560
Thank you!

307
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,232
Now to make a young woman’s
wedding day all about me.

308
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,649
Do you, Rainier

309
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,656
Luftwaffe
Wolfcastle,

310
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,818
take Maria Shriver-
Kennedy-Quimby

311
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,657
to be your
lawful wedded...

312
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,332
HOMER: Up, up,
and annoy!

313
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,330
Yes!

314
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,211
(crowd gasping)

315
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,538
I also wreck bar mitzvahs!

316
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,130
Is that horrible man
gone yet?

317
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,921
Yes, Mother, barring some sort
of pendulum effect.

318
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,836
(groaning)

319
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,965
First Amendment rules,
privacy drools!

320
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,102
(camera shutter clicking)

321
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,348
(groaning)

322
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,679
(German accent):
Time to squash that shutterbug.

323
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,135
You promised me
one day

324
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,306
where you wouldn’t
swear revenge on someone.

325
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,395
Promise revoked.

326
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,531
<i>RAINIER WOLFCASTLE:</i>
<i>Greetings, famous faces</i>

327
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,821
and sizzling stars.

328
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,074
(murmuring in agreement)

329
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,696
Thank you for responding
to my e-vite.

330
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,834
Krusty, your response
was the least funny.

331
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,502
I’m a visual comedian.

332
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,121
Did you get the j-peg?

333
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,127
Wouldn’t open.

334
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,128
Oh!

335
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,589
I wish to discuss
our mutual enemy,

336
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:39,799
Homer Simpson.

337
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,459
(overlapping chatter)

338
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,007
Now, do not worry.

339
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,680
In my film <i>A Future Droid</i>
<i>in King Arthur’s Court,</i>

340
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,049
I learned
that it takes a Robo Knight

341
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,467
to defeat a Robo Knight.

342
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,465
(murmuring in agreement )

343
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,346
And to defeat a paparazzo,

344
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,933
it takes this man!

345
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,808
(foreboding music)

346
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,856
Let me introduce the world’s
greatest celebrity shutterbug--

347
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,031
Enrico Irritazio.

348
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,990
<i>Buono giorno!</i>

349
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,620
How are you gonna
help us, Beefaroni?

350
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,448
Allow me
to explain.

351
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:13,083
I take embarrassing
pictures of Homer,

352
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,712
harass him day and night.

353
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,788
Justice will be served,

354
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,214
and I will be a god
in your eyes!

355
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,843
(agreeable murmurs)

356
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,760
See? It is good.

357
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,468
I declare this meeting
<i>achourned.</i>

358
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,838
Now please,
take some sushi,

359
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,885
’cause if I give it to the dogs,
they will think,

360
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,008
"Oh, now I get sushi
all the time."

361
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,715
And I am not made of sushi.

362
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,233
Now, Maggie, I had
to use your car seat

363
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,941
to hold the
new <i>TV Guide...</i>

364
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:43,652
so I’m gonna hang
you from the mirror.

365
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,284
(giggling)

366
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,952
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

367
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,199
Smile!

368
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,785
(camera shutter clicking)

369
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,460
He’s trying to make me
look like a bad father.

370
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,829
Maggie, take the wheel!

371
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,326
(grunting)

372
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,337
Ten and two,
Einstein!

373
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,959
(camera shutter clicking)

374
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,013
(camera shutter clicking)

375
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,971
Can’t I even have
privacy here?!

376
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,135
(camera shutter clicking)

377
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,221
(suspenseful music)

378
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,273
Scandalous!

379
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,274
Repugnant!

380
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,435
<i>Ausgezeichnet!</i>

381
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:26,573
I shall make this photo
into my screensaver!

382
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,072
Somehow.

383
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,163
How could you
publish this?

384
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,489
I thought we
were friends!

385
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,913
I have no friends.
Friends take time.

386
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,622
And time is money,
and money pays for things,

387
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,872
like a manicure
and a boiled egg.

388
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,453
Get me one of each,
but not boiled, poached.

389
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,658
Ah, what the hell--
it’s Friday-- scrambled!

390
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,167
Sometimes I wish
I had a twin.

391
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,329
Not that much, though.
We’d just fight.

392
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,628
HOMER: And then he said
he didn’t want a twin

393
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,302
because they’d
just fight.

394
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,050
Sweetie, maybe it’s time
you retired from paparazzying.

395
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:54,014
It’s never fun to get a taste
of your own medicine.

396
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,216
You’re right.

397
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,425
I’m giving up photography...
and my own medicine!

398
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,226
So long, anti-clotting agent!

399
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,810
Clot, clot, clot, clot
clot, clot, clot, clot!

400
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:06,686
(Kylie Minogue’s "Can’t Get You
Out of My Head" playing)

401
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,025
(chuckles)

402
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,860
With Homer Simpson
out of the way,

403
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:13,115
we can go back to our lives
of sybaritic excess.

404
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,578
Stem cell fajita?

405
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,788
Leave the tray.

406
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,459
(loud laughter)

407
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:26,089
(thunder rumbling)

408
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,340
Listen to ’em.

409
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,711
They’re on top of the world

410
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,627
while I’m sittin’ here
pretending I have a stool.

411
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,337
All because of a bunch
of stuff that happened.

412
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,508
Ah, Homer, don’t
be so quick

413
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,427
to abandon this
paparazzo thing.

414
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,225
Yeah, it’s an American tradition
to cut people down to size

415
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,350
because they’ve brought
so much joy into our lives.

416
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,517
You know who
I can’t stand?

417
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,265
That Robin Williams.

418
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,976
You know, one time I saw him
eating dinner with his children.

419
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,358
He wouldn’t take
the time out

420
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,704
to do all the funny bits
from his movies.

421
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,820
And my sister once saw
Burt Reynolds at an airport,

422
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,987
and he wouldn’t even
cosign her mortgage.

423
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,536
You guys are right--
I should get back in the game.

424
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,620
Oh! But I threw away my camera.

425
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:02,865
Oh, here,
use this one.

426
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,786
I was gonna use it
to take secret photos

427
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,335
in the ladies’
toilet, but, uh,

428
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,918
no dames ever come
in this joint.

429
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,633
Thanks, Moe!

430
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:10,763
Sure.

431
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,724
Excuse me, do you have
a ladies’ room?

432
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,353
We need to trade bras
and panties.

433
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,890
Oh, you got
to be kidding me!

434
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:21,854
(glass shatters)

435
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,604
(song continues)

436
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:24,685
(thunder rumbling)

437
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,702
Oh!

438
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,609
You call this
a drink?

439
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,947
No, I never called it
a drink.

440
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,622
(thunder rumbling,
music stops abruptly)

441
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,040
How do you want
your comeuppance--

442
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,290
eight by ten
or wallet size?

443
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,173
Celebrities,
hide your shame!

444
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,460
(loud shotgun-like pops
of shutter clicking)

445
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,851
(all groaning and whimpering)

446
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:11,731
What are you going to
do with those photos?

447
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,147
-Nothing.
-ALL: Huh?

448
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,565
Providing you celebrities

449
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,323
do something for me.

450
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,865
I want you all
to show some respect

451
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,579
for the people
who made you what you are.

452
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,409
Sign an autograph or two.

453
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,294
Support a charity
for something

454
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,331
that hasn’t happened
to a member of your family.

455
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:31,125
Let one of us regular guys write
a terrible children’s book!

456
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,751
We will take
the deal.

457
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,758
As a sign of good faith,
I invite you and your family

458
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,891
to a barbecue on
my offshore party platform.

459
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,481
{\an8}(sighs)
It is good doing real things
with real people.

460
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,443
Say, Rainier,
you’re in show business.

461
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,944
Would you mind taking a look
at this screenplay I wrote?

462
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,448
Oh, sorry.

463
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,529
I do not read
unsolicited manuscripts.

464
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,038
(lights buzzing)

465
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,539
(grunts)

466
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,794
Well, at least
it got made.

467
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,505
Captioned by VISUAL DATA

468
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,724
Shh!
