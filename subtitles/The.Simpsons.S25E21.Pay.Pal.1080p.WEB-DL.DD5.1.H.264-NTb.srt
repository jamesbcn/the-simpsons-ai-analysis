You know? Adult games.

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,305
Well, not "adult games,"
fun games, like Charades...

70
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:26,370
or as you call
it, Pictionary.

71
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:30,164
It sounds like fun.
I'll just tell Homer and...

72
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:35,176
Homer, for the last time, do
not drink the Yahtzee dice.

73
00:04:35,185 --> 00:04:36,092
Fine.

Oh, we're going

78
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:48,485

80
00:04:49,946 --> 00:04:52,514
Well, if you change your
mind, please let us know.

81
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:54,468
We could become
"couples friends."

82
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:57,963
Now, let me try some of Ned
Flanders' No Alarm Chili.

83
00:04:57,975 --> 00:04:59,960

the spoon.

84
00:04:59,984 --> 00:05:00,919

85
00:05:03,414 --> 00:05:05,731

any couples friends?

(groans)

87
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:10,033
Because... couples
friends are a myth,

88
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:12,630
started by restaurants
with tables for four.

89
00:05:12,643 --> 00:05:15,710
I want friends!
Any friends.

90
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:18,149
Okay, sweetie. I'll
call the Van Houtens.

91
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:19,716
- Not the Van Houtens.
- But...

92
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:22,026
They're always bragging
about their trip to Rome.

93
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:24,860
It was 12 years ago,
and it was a layover.

94
00:05:24,886 --> 00:05:26,678
I want new friends.

95
00:05:26,698 --> 00:05:28,391
LISA: Can I make
an observation?

96
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:32,042
I'm okay with no friends.
It's easier to focus,

97
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:35,591
and it'll give me great material
for whatever art form I choose.

98
00:05:35,604 --> 00:05:38,385
Right now, I'm
thinking long novella.

99
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:39,288
Good night.

100
00:05:39,301 --> 00:05:42,570
Okay with no friends?

101
00:05:42,587 --> 00:05:46,104
That's the saddest thing I can
imagine my daughter saying to me.

102
00:05:46,123 --> 00:05:47,331
BART:
I can think of worse.

103
00:05:47,357 --> 00:05:51,070
The saddest thing would be if you
were driving and texting Lisa

104
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:54,873
and you hit her. And the last thing
she texted before she died was,

105
00:05:54,885 --> 00:05:56,673
"I got your message."

106
00:05:57,228 --> 00:05:58,361
Good night.

107
00:06:00,618 --> 00:06:02,425
Well, they all
make good points.

108
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,314
ANNOUNCER: <i>And now, the moment
of truth on Topiary Wars.</i>

109
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:21,044
This Taj Mahal should be
floated down the Ganges.

110
00:06:21,064 --> 00:06:23,451
I'm sorry, Cathy. Turn in
your shears and ladders.

111
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:26,336
Come and get 'em!
(laughs maniacally)

112
00:06:26,464 --> 00:06:27,664
(grunting)

113
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:29,492
Oh! Thank you.

114
00:06:29,513 --> 00:06:31,948
Why was that on the
Military History Channel?

115
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:36,151
We're going to that game party, and
we're going to be charming and witty.

116
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,251
You're not going to
eat too much,

117
00:06:38,263 --> 00:06:40,536
and we're not going
to stay too late.

118
00:06:40,544 --> 00:06:43,579
MARGE: You will not sing
unless there's a sing-along,

119
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:46,952
and never take the tray
out of the caterer's hand.

120
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:49,951
Don't be too loud,
and don't be too quiet.

121
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:52,581
When you're too quiet,
you get that psycho look.

122
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:53,960
(jittering)

123
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,327
And stay in the living room.

124
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:58,346
Don't go to their kids' room
and watch a basketball game.

125
00:06:58,365 --> 00:07:00,742
- Can I check out what
toys they have? - No.

126
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:01,935
(groans)

127
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,465
Dinner party
at the neighbors'.

128
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:07,149
- At least I can drink.
- One drink.

129
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:10,105
Wha...?! Walking
distance, Marge!

130
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:12,858
I've been looking forward
to this all week.

131
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:16,893
DUFFMAN: Don't show
your wife this app!

132
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:18,166
Powering down!

133
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:22,398
You were charming
enough to win me,

134
00:07:22,418 --> 00:07:25,243
and that day you didn't
have a drink in you.

135
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:33,329
Marge! Homer!

136
00:07:33,357 --> 00:07:35,858
Mwah! Mwah!

137
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:37,881
(quietly):
Homer.

138
00:07:37,902 --> 00:07:40,227
You know, I have
more cheeks.

139
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,352
(chuckles)

140
00:07:41,372 --> 00:07:43,765
I'd like you to meet
my wife Wallis.

141
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:44,758
(deep voice):
How ya doin'?

142
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:47,945
Wallis has unearthed the most
delightful entertainment

143
00:07:47,957 --> 00:07:49,750
to thrill us for
hours on end.

144
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:53,306
It's a murder mystery,
and we're all suspects.

145
00:07:53,346 --> 00:07:54,719
(crowd gasps)

146
00:07:54,745 --> 00:07:58,150
Great! I've always wanted
to try and solve a crime.

147
00:07:58,775 --> 00:07:59,835
(crowd gasps)

148
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,383
Please, everyone,
read your bio.

149
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,150
(gasps)

150
00:08:03,162 --> 00:08:06,695
I am a humble farmer
from Yorkshire.

151
00:08:06,714 --> 00:08:09,225
Humble I can be!

152
00:08:09,244 --> 00:08:10,605
That's the spirit!

153
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:12,691
Wallis and I have found
this game to provide

154
00:08:12,704 --> 00:08:15,471
a full evening of
<i>divertissement,</i>

155
00:08:15,497 --> 00:08:18,589
building in suspense
to a masterful climax.

156
00:08:18,616 --> 00:08:23,116
We've rented costumes you'll find accurate
to period <i>and</i> conducive to character.

157
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:27,236
We will serve food and wine
appropriate to period and palette.

158
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:28,724
(excited murmuring)

159
00:08:28,737 --> 00:08:32,483
We've programmed music to
cover every dramatic event.

160
00:08:32,497 --> 00:08:34,241
Hired a Foley artist.

161
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:35,956
(steady galloping)

162
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,773
I believe the mare
has a slight limp.

163
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,660
(erratic galloping)

164
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,347
Yes. Yes!

165
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:47,773
So, for the next three hours, I
welcome you to the moors of...

166
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:51,744
Question. Uh, it says here the
murderer is Admiral Wainsworth.

167
00:08:51,762 --> 00:08:52,502
Who's that?

168
00:08:52,522 --> 00:08:53,767
(crowd groaning, murmuring)

169
00:08:53,787 --> 00:08:56,493
You've... you-you've
given away the game!

170
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,220
Well, you know...

171
00:08:58,255 --> 00:08:59,421
Why you...!

172
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,017
(both grunting)

173
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,627
Thank you so much!

174
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,384
Now Wallis will once again
withdraw into melancholia!

175
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:11,055
(monotonous):
Birth, school, work, death.

176
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:13,681
Worth, drool, shirk, breath.

177
00:09:13,694 --> 00:09:16,516
Mirth, cruel, quirk, meth.

178
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:17,972
Just so you know, Homer,

179
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:22,199
you were going to be a dashing
Russian count with multiple lovers!

180
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:24,904
Well, as we say in Russia,

181
00:09:24,922 --> 00:09:28,377
- "Good-bye in Russian!"
- <i>Do svidaniya!</i>

182
00:09:35,395 --> 00:09:37,904
Uh, nice night for a walk.

183
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:38,677
(sighs)

184
00:09:38,697 --> 00:09:41,019
I'd like to be alone
for a while.

185
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:45,557
- You want to be more alone?
- Yes.

186
00:09:50,151 --> 00:09:52,281
- More?
- Mm-hmm.

187
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:56,569
What the...?! D'oh!

188
00:09:56,577 --> 00:09:57,922
(groaning)

189
00:09:57,955 --> 00:09:59,666
That's good.

190
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,879
Okay, I slept on the couch and I
flipped the sweaty cushions over.

191
00:10:06,892 --> 00:10:09,070
- What else can I do?
- It's okay.

192
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:12,873
I mean, those people didn't even want
us at that party in the first place.

193
00:10:12,886 --> 00:10:17,100
I think it's time we learn to
live with being ostracized.

194
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,400
Mmm...

195
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:21,627
Don't you dare say
"ostrich eyes"!

196
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:23,905
Because... uh...

197
00:10:23,918 --> 00:10:26,573
Oh! Oh, okay, okay!
What should we do?

198
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,280
Nothing. I give up.

199
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,042
No more dinner parties.

200
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:35,287
Our whole social life will be us
watching TV and you going to Moe's.

201
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:37,167
I see.

202
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:39,747
(quietly):
Woo-hoo!

203
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,404
(rattles)

204
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,430
Well, if that's how you
think it has to be.

205
00:10:45,456 --> 00:10:46,990
Yes, for us.

206
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,430
But not for Lisa.
Never for Lisa.

207
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:52,431
We're going to help
her make friends.

208
00:10:52,457 --> 00:10:54,198
It might be easier
with Maggie.

209
00:10:54,222 --> 00:10:56,663
She's always getting letters
from the day care center.

210
00:10:56,683 --> 00:11:00,850
- Those are past-due bills.
- They'll get their blood money.

211
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:03,782
And Lisa will
get a friend.

212
00:11:04,484 --> 00:11:06,517
After this, we'll
do makeovers.

213
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,785
(groans)

214
00:11:11,852 --> 00:11:13,599
So where are
all the friends?

215
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:14,886
I don't know.

216
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:17,887
I invited everyone
that Lisa's ever met.

217
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,206
- Who are you?
- Gus Huebner.

218
00:11:20,225 --> 00:11:23,591
I was on Lisa's coed
soccer team two years ago.

219
00:11:24,157 --> 00:11:26,270
Well, Lisa's gonna be
here in five minutes,

220
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,980
and the only kid who showed up
is Gus freakin' Huebner.

221
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:30,823
- Watch your mouth.
- (groans)

222
00:11:30,851 --> 00:11:33,018
Oh, no, you're
right, Homer. Abort!

223
00:11:33,038 --> 00:11:35,100
- Abort!
 Oh, no.

224
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,551
I was the only chump who
showed up at this train wreck.

225
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:39,631
Well, I'm not leaving
till I get a party.

226
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:42,508
Fine, fine. Homer,
give him a party.

Gus Huebner?
Is that you?

230
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,364
(chuckles):
I wish.

231
00:12:18,383 --> 00:12:20,316
That kid can play
youth soccer.

232
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:27,164
Are you guys okay?

233
00:12:27,177 --> 00:12:28,783
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
I'm fine.

234
00:12:28,802 --> 00:12:30,782
Yeah. That's...
Nothing's going on.

235
00:12:30,808 --> 00:12:32,129
Right, right. Nothing.

236
00:12:32,146 --> 00:12:34,919
- What's for dinner?
- Pizza. Mmm.

237
00:12:34,939 --> 00:12:36,631
Lots of pizza.

238
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:49,323
So, as her teacher, I was
wondering if you could tell me

239
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:52,535
why Lisa has such
trouble making friends.

240
00:12:52,552 --> 00:12:55,679
Marge, this is when I
normally eat lunch.

241
00:12:55,702 --> 00:12:59,338
So I'll just tell you
Lisa is... unique.

242
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:01,407
And we're done.

243
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:10,458
All right. For some reason, square
dancing is a part of the gym curriculum.

244
00:13:10,471 --> 00:13:13,021
Now, I'm gonna open the
divider to the girls' gym,

245
00:13:13,048 --> 00:13:17,368
and if you don't find a dance
partner within ten seconds,

246
00:13:17,384 --> 00:13:20,254

251
00:13:39,492 --> 00:13:40,759
That's tough luck, Lisa.

252
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,912
Looks like you're dancing
with Groundskeeper Willie.

00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:46,314

00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,689
Marge, don't feel bad.

349
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:16,193
You did what any
parent would do.

350
00:18:16,215 --> 00:18:18,267
No, I think I
went too far.

351
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:24,223
Let me tell you a little story about
a chubby unpopular boy named Homer.

352
00:18:24,242 --> 00:18:26,602
Is that the boy you
named me after?

353
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:28,233
It is you, you idiot!

354
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,653
- Whoa. - Little Homer had a
devil of a time making friends.

355
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:33,660
No one wanted to
come visit him.

356
00:18:33,672 --> 00:18:37,094
<i>So I decided to take
matters into my own hands.</i>

357
00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:39,257
<i>I paid a couple of boys,</i>

358
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:43,567
<i>Lenny and Carl, to make
my Homer feel loved.</i>

359
00:18:43,593 --> 00:18:47,169
<i>A relationship I
continued to this day.</i>

360
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:50,006
You pay Lenny and Carl
to be my friends?!

361
00:18:50,032 --> 00:18:52,625
Yes, but Barney's
yours for nothing.

362
00:18:52,651 --> 00:18:54,311
- Aw.
- Hmm.

363
00:18:54,318 --> 00:18:56,708
Well, that makes
me feel better.

364
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:57,479
(lock clicks)

365
00:18:57,505 --> 00:18:59,730
Lisa's door is unlocked!

366
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:03,338
Dad, is that story
really true?

367
00:19:03,371 --> 00:19:04,191
(laughs)

368
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:08,045
I wouldn't pay ten cents to a
lion to stop him from eating you!

369
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,060
(groans)

370
00:19:12,043 --> 00:19:14,705
Lisa, just say
something to me.

371
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:18,358
I'm gonna tell every psychiatrist
I ever go to what you did.

372
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:21,554
(voice breaking):
A mother's greatest fear.

373
00:19:21,574 --> 00:19:23,775
(crying)

374
00:19:24,535 --> 00:19:26,462
LISA:
<i>Wow, I made Mom cry.</i>

375
00:19:26,477 --> 00:19:28,488
<i>What unimaginable power.</i>

376
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:31,048
<i>I can use this to get
anything I want.</i>

377
00:19:31,063 --> 00:19:35,984
<i>But right now, all I want
is for Mom to stop crying.</i>

378
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:38,688
Mom, stop! Stop!

379
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,190
Stop. I'm sorry.

380
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:44,279
- Oh...
- Please stop!

381
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,143
(cries, snorts)

382
00:19:46,712 --> 00:19:47,645
(sighs)

383
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:49,627
You're not mad anymore?

384
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,667
I'm fine. Fine.
It's funny, but...

385
00:19:52,684 --> 00:19:55,279
hurting your feelings
made me feel better.

386
00:19:55,306 --> 00:19:57,270
Mm, try to forget that.

387
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:59,772
But when I grow up,
I'll find other weird kids,

388
00:19:59,785 --> 00:20:03,128
and we will have the most
intense relationships ever.

389
00:20:03,147 --> 00:20:05,216
And I'll always love you.

390
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,792
Aw.

391
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:08,812
Happy Mother's Day.

392
00:20:08,826 --> 00:20:11,461
- Mother's Day?!
- Mother's Day?! Crap!

393
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:20,308
Okay, initially I was just gonna be your
friend till I could afford a nice belt.

394
00:20:20,331 --> 00:20:23,897
But I like you, Lisa, and I want
to keep being friends with you.

395
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:28,133
Great. But from now on, we have to
be totally honest with each other.

396
00:20:28,153 --> 00:20:30,127
You're absolutely right.

397
00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:32,169
I'm not really a vegetarian.

398
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,696
Have you ever
tried horse meat?

399
00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:35,751
They eat it raw
in Japan, and...

Shh!
