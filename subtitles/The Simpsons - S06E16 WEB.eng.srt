1
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:06,131
The Simpsons.

2
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,679
Go, toothpaste, go!

3
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,306
Move your pasty
white butt.

4
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,017
Come on, shampoo!
You can do it!

5
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,103
Yay! I won your stupid
bathroom products race.

6
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,480
No fair, you only won

7
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,939
'cause you had
the inside track.

8
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,417
If the water was spinning
the other way...

9
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,234
It never spins
the other way.

10
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,611
In the northern hemisphere

11
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,613
water always drains
counterclockwise.

12
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,073
It's called
the Coriolis effect.

13
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,449
No way.

14
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,785
Water doesn't
obey your rules.

15
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,119
It goes where it wants.

16
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,579
Like me, babe.

17
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,164
Yes, Bart.

18
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,624
Why don't you
try it and see?

19
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,089
I know I've seen it
go the other way.

20
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,716
Faithful toilet.

21
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
You'll prove me right.

22
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,978
I'm a-singin' in
the show... Ow! Ow-ooh!

23
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,106
Hot! Yah! Cold!

24
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,149
No! Hot! Cold! Hot!

25
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,944
Oh! Who's! Doing! That?!

26
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:57,659
Oh, for Pete's sake, Bart,
use the plunger!

27
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,619
Bart, water will
only go the other way

28
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,579
in the southern
hemisphere.

29
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,624
What the hell is
the southern hemisphere?

30
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,187
Haven't you ever
looked at your globe?

31
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,839
See, the southern hemisphere
is made up of

32
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,006
everything
below the equa...

33
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,844
This line.

34
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:20,056
So down there in,
say... Argentina,

35
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,475
or Rand McNally,

36
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,102
all their water
runs backwards?

37
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:27,480
Uh-huh. In fact,
in Rand McNally

38
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,898
they wear hats
on their feet

39
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,608
and hamburgers
eat people.

40
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,818
Cool.

41
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,589
Hello,
southern hemisphere?

42
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,591
Which way does the water
go in your toilet?

43
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,634
Just a minute, I'll check.

44
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,434
Ah, nuts.

45
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,065
Please to repeat again
and I will translating

46
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,109
for the El Presidente.

47
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,654
Which way does
the water turn in your toilet?

48
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,406
Dice que el curso
esta cambiando.

49
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,991
Ay, caramba!

50
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,327
Los insurgentes ya van
a capturar la capital.

51
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,410
Necesito huir.

52
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,453
Ay!

53
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,250
I can't get a straight answer
out of this crazy hemisphere.

54
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,048
Eine minuten,
eine minuten.

55
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:39,510
Ach! Das wagenfone
est eine nuisancefone.

56
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,304
Buenas noches,
mein fuhrer.

57
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,680
Ja, ja.

58
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,437
Bart, you can't actually
call these places.

59
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,272
Don't you know
how expensive

60
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,565
international calls are?

61
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,485
Hello, operator.

62
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,196
I'd like to make
a collect call to...

63
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,530
Australia.

64
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,915
This is the
international operator.

65
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,625
Will you accept
a collect call from...

66
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,336
Uh, yes, this is
Dr. Bart Simpson

67
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,688
of the International
Drainage Commission.

68
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:15,712
It's an emergency.

69
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,340
If it's an emergency, then.

70
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,525
We understand some
drains in your area

71
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,676
have been malfunctioning,

72
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,344
sucking in people
and whatnot.

73
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,096
Willikers. That's awful.

74
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,555
Indeed.

75
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,766
We need you to check
your sinks and toilets

76
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,518
and tell us which way
the water is going.

77
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,228
And please...
Stand clear.

78
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,987
The fixtures...

79
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,780
they're all draining
clockwise, sir.

80
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,198
Oh. She was right.

81
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,284
Stupid Lisa,
science queen.

82
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,053
Well, why don't you just check
your neighbor's drains.

83
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,245
I'll hold.

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,377
Hey, Bart.
The bakery caught fire

85
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,212
and all of downtown
smells like cookies.

86
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,006
Want to go smell?

87
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,300
Yes. Yes, I do.

88
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,436
Hello. Sir? Sir?

89
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,188
I've returned from
the Koolamugery's place.

90
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,732
They're draining
clockwise too.

91
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,066
Draining?

92
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,484
I don't care
about that anymore.

93
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,568
Are we in any dange...

94
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,619
Burkina Faso?
Disputed zone?

95
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,246
Who called
all these weird places?

96
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,247
Quiet. It might be you.

97
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,248
I can't remember.

98
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,541
No, I'm gonna ask Marge.

99
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,835
No, no.
Why embarrass us both?

100
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,796
Just write a check and I'll release
some more endorphins.

101
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,010
900 dollar-adoos!?

102
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,219
Tobias!

103
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,763
Did you accept

104
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,015
a six-hour collect
call from the states?

105
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,975
It was an emergency call

106
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,062
from the International Drainage
Commission in Springfield.

107
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,813
Oh, my God!

108
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,737
There's nothing wrong
with the bidet, is there?

109
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,109
Hello?

110
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,486
Right,
I'm calling all the way

111
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,363
from Squatters Crag,
Australia.

112
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,574
And I want to speak to, uh,
Dr. Bart Simpson right now.

113
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,659
Uh... hold, please.

114
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,286
All right, but I don't...

115
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,746
Payroll,
Burt Stanton speaking.

116
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,123
Oi. I said Bart Simpson.

117
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,666
What kind of a company
is this?

118
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,126
Bart Simpson's office.

119
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,545
Thank the great good Lord.
Look, I was just say...

120
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,671
One moment please.

121
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,175
Who do they think I am?

122
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,511
Some stupid Aussie drongo?

123
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,471
Bleedin' yanks.
I ought to...

124
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,472
This is Bart Simpson.

125
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,848
Can I help you, ma'am?

126
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,893
Yeah... Hey! My name is
Bruno Drundridge, right?

127
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,270
You owe me $900, mate.

128
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,231
No, you owe me $900.

129
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,899
I... You... Ohh...

130
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,735
You're... You're just
some punk kid aren't you?

131
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,322
You picked the wrong guy
to tangle with here, mate.

132
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,825
I don't think so.

133
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,910
You're all the way
in Australia.

134
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,078
Hey, I think I hear

135
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,704
a dingo eating
your baby.

136
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,164
Yeah, well... Ooh!

137
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,542
Oh. Ah. That's it.

138
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,503
I'm going to report this
to me member of parliament.

139
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,004
Hey! Gus!

140
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,215
I got something
to report to you.

141
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,926
That's a bloody
outrage, it is.

142
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,761
I'm gonna take this
all the way

143
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,430
to the prime minister.

144
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:17,311
Hey! Mr. Prime Minister!

145
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,396
Andy!

146
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,566
Hi, mates!
What's the good word?

147
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,611
"Mr. Simpson, blah blah.

148
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,905
Misrepresentation
over a telephone, yadda yadda.

149
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,074
Sincerely,
some Australian Jerk."

150
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,627
Hey! I need that.

151
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,754
Office of the
Solicitor General?

152
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,007
Office
of the Prime Minister?

153
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,259
Hopping Mad Collection Agency?

154
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,969
What is all this stuff?

155
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,305
Nothing. Some stupid country

156
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,890
thinks I owe them money.

157
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,850
Uh-oh. Bart,
you better talk

158
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,560
to Mom and Dad about this.

159
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:01,063
Hey, guys. Just so you don't
hear any wild rumors...

160
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,149
I'm being indicted
for fraud in Australia.

161
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,568
That's no reason
to block the TV.

162
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,944
Oh, my.

163
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,116
Bart, did you trick
an Australian boy

164
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,827
into accepting a
$900 collect call?

165
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:15,953
Yes'm.

166
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,165
Hmm... There it is,
"Aus-tral-ia."

167
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,791
I'll be damned.

168
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,171
Look at this country...
"U-ar-gay."

169
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,094
Oh, my. Hello.

170
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,348
I'm Evan Conniver with
the U.S. State department.

171
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,142
"Undersecretary for
International Protocol...

172
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,603
Brat and Punk division"?

173
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,688
Unfortunately, Bart,
your little escapade

174
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,398
could not have come
at a worse time.

175
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:48,236
Americo-Australian-ian relations
are at an all-time low.

176
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,836
As I'm sure you remember
in the late 1980s

177
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,032
the U.S. Experienced

178
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,492
a short-lived infatuation

179
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,577
with Australian culture.

180
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,955
For some bizarre reason
the Aussies thought

181
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,265
this would be
a permanent thing.

182
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,289
Of course it wasn't.

183
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,833
I know those words

184
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,460
but that sign makes no sense.

185
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,629
Anyway, the down-under
fad fizzled

186
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,966
and the diplomatic climate
turned absolutely frosty.

187
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,831
Let's pretend we
didn't see that.

188
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,307
And Bart's childish taunting
agitated the Aussies further.

189
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,809
Oh, he'll agitate you.

190
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,019
Ho, ho, he sure will.

191
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,484
What can we do for you?

192
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,488
Well, it's too late
to merely pay back the money.

193
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,031
But as a sign of good faith
to our Australian "friends"

194
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,659
we'd like to imprison Bart
for five years.

195
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,494
That's tough but fair.

196
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,787
Boy, go with the man.

197
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,623
No, no, no! No.

198
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,292
I'm not gonna have my
son go to jail

199
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,253
over some silly tiff
with Australia.

200
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,088
You'll just have
to find some other

201
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,424
country to have
relations with.

202
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,267
You're sure now?
The prison train is sailing.

203
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,638
Okay. I'm not hearing
a lot of support for prison.

204
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,724
There is one other option.

205
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,809
They'll drop the charges if.

206
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,437
Bart makes a public apology
in Australia.

207
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,771
All Bart has to do
is apologize

208
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,773
and we get a free trip
to Australia?

209
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,942
I can handle that.

210
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,253
I'm an expert
at phony apologies.

211
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,903
- Bart!
- I'm sorry.

212
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,155
That's better.

213
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,523
Uh, we left at
1:30 p.m. Monday.

214
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,442
What time is it now?

215
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,986
It's 6:45 a.m. next Wednesday.

216
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,404
You may also be
interested to know

217
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,281
that's it's summer
here, not winter.

218
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,409
What does that sign say?

219
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,745
I thought they spoke
English in this country.

220
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,871
It says you
can't bring in

221
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,998
outside plants
or animals.

222
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,541
Any foreign creature
you bring in

223
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,127
could upset the
environmental balance.

224
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,757
Sorry, girl.

225
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,777
I don't want to get
in any more trouble down here.

226
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,386
I'll pick you up
on the way home.

227
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,739
Hey! Are you like one
of those English guards

228
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,075
who can't laugh
or smile or anything?

229
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,455
No, sir!

230
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,749
U.S. Marine Corps, sir!

231
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:55,089
Oh, yeah.
This is the life.

232
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,882
Boy, next summer,
can you commit

233
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,884
some fraud in
Orlando, Florida?

234
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,428
I'm way ahead of you, Dad.

235
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,012
Kno-ock.

236
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,181
Simpsons, I'd like you
to meet our ambassador,

237
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,975
the honorable Avril Ward.

238
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,687
Hello. Now, everything is
all set for Bart's apology.

239
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,398
Mr. Conniver will meet you at
the parliament house at 3:00 p.m.

240
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,691
Any questions?

241
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,735
Yeah. Do the toilets go
backwards in here?

242
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,112
No. To combat homesickness
we've installed

243
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,157
a device that makes them swirl
the correct American way.

244
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:33,753
Sweet land of liberty,
of thee I sing.

245
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,301
Hey, G.I. Joe,
your sign's broken.

246
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,136
We're already in Australia.

247
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,889
Actually, sir! The embassy is
considered American soil, sir!

248
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,265
Really?

249
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,517
Look, boy. Now
I'm in Australia.

250
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,103
Now I'm in America.
Australia. America.

251
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,438
- I get it, Dad.
- Australia.

252
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,647
America, Australia.

253
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,774
Homer, that's enough.

254
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,901
America, Australia...

255
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,612
Here in America, we don't
tolerate that kind of crap, sir!

256
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,991
"Australia was
originally founded

257
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,452
as a settlement
for British convicts."

258
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,913
Hmm, Lisa,
watch your camera.

259
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,588
You call that a knife?

260
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,799
This is a knife.

261
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,134
That's not a knife.
That's a spoon.

262
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,136
All right, all right.
You win.

263
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,014
I see you've played
knifey-spoony before.

264
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,685
Hey, give me one of those
famous giant beers

265
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,646
I heard so much about.

266
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,689
Something wrong, Yank?

267
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,360
No. It's pretty big,
I guess.

268
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,237
I'll just have
a cup of coffee.

269
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,321
Beer it is.

270
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,031
No. I said coffee.

271
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,032
Beer?

272
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,243
Cof-fee.

273
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,994
Be-er?

274
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,205
C-o...

275
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,290
B-e...

276
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,631
We'll meet you boys
back here for dinner.

277
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:01,799
Good luck, honey.

278
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,760
Bart, I'm sorry
I'm gonna miss

279
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,053
your public humiliation.

280
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,930
But the Woolumbaloo
Dirt Monument

281
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,432
is just too exciting
to pass up.

282
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,233
Hear ye, hear ye.

283
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,527
This session
will now come to order.

284
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,488
With the cooperation of
the U.S. Department of State

285
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,824
we have present today
one Bart Simpson.

286
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,204
I believe he has
something to say.

287
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,288
Bart?

288
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,592
I'm sorry.

289
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,927
I'm sorry for what
I did to your country.

290
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,554
- Bravo.
- Very good.

291
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:52,141
Well, you're
free to go, Bart...

292
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,476
right after your
additional punishment.

293
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,811
Punishment?

294
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,564
Well, a mere apology
would be bit empty, eh?

295
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:01,609
- Let the booting begin.
- Booting?

296
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,861
Aw, it's just a little
kick in the bum.

297
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,047
What kind of a sick country
would kick someone

298
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,381
with a giant boot?

299
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,674
Mr. Simpson, shush.

300
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,885
Disparaging the boot
is a bootable offense.

301
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,720
It's one of
their proudest traditions.

302
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,311
You sold us out, Conniver!

303
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,281
Stay back or I'll boot
your prime minister.

304
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,407
I'll do it!

305
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,784
So help me God,
I'll boot him!

306
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,661
He means it.

307
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,205
When will you
Australians learn?

308
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,874
In America, we stopped
using corporal punishment

309
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,278
and things have
never been better.

310
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,961
The streets are safe.

311
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,214
Old people strut confidently
through the darkest alleys

312
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,424
and the weak and nerdy
are admired

313
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,677
for their computer
programming abilities.

314
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,931
So, like us, let your children
run wild and free.

315
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:17,142
Because as the old
saying goes:

316
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,354
"Let your children
run wild and free."

317
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,773
Now, boy, run back
to the embassy.

318
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,316
Back to American soil.

319
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,364
I'll stop them.

320
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,328
Oh, no.
It's coming back this way.

321
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,288
That throwing stick
stunt of yours

322
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,372
has boomeranged on us.

323
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,213
Hey. We can get away
in their pouches.

324
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:51,051
Eew! It's not like
in cartoons.

325
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,429
Yeah, there's
a lot more mucus.

326
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,269
Mom, you said I could have
one souvenir, right?

327
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,021
Well, I want a didgeridoo.

328
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,404
That seems very noisy and
expensive for a souvenir.

329
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,490
Why don't you get
this nice cap?

330
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,868
It's clever,
just like you.

331
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,873
Get out. Get out.

332
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,332
Shoo, shoo.

333
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,168
Get out of here. Ugh!

334
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,170
These bloody things
are everywhere.

335
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,573
They're in the lift,
in the lorry,

336
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,881
in the bond wizard,

337
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,674
and all over the
malanga gildachuck.

338
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,551
They're like kangaroos

339
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,928
but they're reptiles,
they is.

340
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,598
We have them in America.
They're called bullfrogs.

341
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,850
What?! That's an odd name.

342
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,102
I'd have called them
chaswassers.

343
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,440
L-isa!

344
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,941
M-arge!

345
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,286
Oh, the Simpsons.

346
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,413
Well, they're not
getting back in here.

347
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,554
I can't believe
our government

348
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,014
would set up Bart
like that.

349
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,349
I must say,
I'm very angry

350
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,576
at the State department
right now.

351
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,102
Yes, but shh.

352
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,187
Mrs. Simpson, please.
We're about to reach

353
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,289
a breakthrough
with the Aussies.

354
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,313
Then it's agreed.

355
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,565
During the bargaining session

356
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,942
we each get two candy apples.

357
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,319
All right.
One candy and one caramel.

358
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,821
Oh, for the love of criminy.

359
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,322
Give me that.

360
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,533
I know Bart did something wrong,
but he's my son

361
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,160
and I'm going to
punish him myself.

362
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,412
Our countries may have
their differences

363
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,164
but as human beings

364
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,584
I think we can all agree
there's no substitute

365
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,420
for the discipline
of a loving parent.

366
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,632
He wants to talk to you.

367
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,050
Y-ello.

368
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,594
So we're in agreement.

369
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,318
She won't be allowed
near the phone again.

370
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,224
We did it.

371
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,600
We've worked out
a compromise

372
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,103
that will allow both nations
to save face.

373
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,313
We've argued them
down to a booting.

374
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,523
What?!

375
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,774
The prime minister
just wants

376
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,943
to kick you once
through the gate

377
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,028
with a regular shoe.

378
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,131
I believe it's a wing-tip.

379
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,322
No deal.

380
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,408
This is my son
we're talking about.

381
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,742
Sure, he's not perfect

382
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,578
but who is in this
work-a-day world?

383
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,829
No, Mom. Wait.

384
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,882
It's time for me
to bend over

385
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,508
and receive my destiny.

386
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,598
Thank you, Bart.

387
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,849
I promise I won't

388
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,101
make fun of you
later for this.

389
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,853
Show them what
American butts

390
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,146
are made of, son.

391
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,360
That's it, lad.

392
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,739
This is for the commonwealth
of Australia.

393
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:09,625
And this is for
the United States of America.

394
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,975
I'm glad you're okay, honey,

395
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,620
but I wish you'd chosen
a more tasteful way

396
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,020
to be patriotic.

397
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,272
I'm impressed you were
able to write so legibly

398
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,523
on your own butt.

399
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,955
All right, mates.
Let him have it!

400
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,211
Hey, do we get to land on
an aircraft carrier?

401
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:57,631
No, sir. The closest vessel is
the U.S.S. Walter Mondale.

402
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,091
It's a laundry ship.

403
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,759
They'll take you
the rest of the way.

404
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,232
Hey, look.

405
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,359
Those frogs are eating
all their crops.

406
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,408
Well, that's what happens

407
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,993
when you introduce
foreign species

408
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,370
into an ecosystem
that can't handle them.
