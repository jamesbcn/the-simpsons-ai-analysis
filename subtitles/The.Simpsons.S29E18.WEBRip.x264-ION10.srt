1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,872
Can't let you do it.

2
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:06,607
Can't let you break my record.

3
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:18,018
27... 28...

4
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:20,588
Okay, Homer, this is
the last pickled egg.

5
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,523
Keep it down
and you win 50 bucks.

6
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:25,759
Okay. If I win,
we're going out for omelets.

7
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:32,833
Yeah! I am the champion
of this very bad idea!

8
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,936
He's gonna blow!

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,276
Hey, Moe, you're not gonna serve
those eggs, are you?

10
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,946
No, no. I... I find
another use for 'em.

11
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:58,326
I was 50 bucks up until I blew
every egg out of my belly.

12
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,131
Whoa! Hey there, pal.

13
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:07,034
I'm afraid that was
the mayor's favorite light pole.

14
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,036
You give me the car,

15
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,940
I give you 500 bucks
and I make all of this go away.

16
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:16,144
This is awkward.

17
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:18,146
You don't have to thank me.

18
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,116
Marge.

19
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,951
When you start a sentence
with Marge,

20
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:25,253
it's really bad.

21
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:27,921
Marge, Marge, Marge.

22
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:30,891
I sold our car!

23
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,427
- What are you gonna drive?
- Your car.

24
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:36,230
Well, then I guess
I'll be riding the bus.

25
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:39,833
That's right. Like rock stars
and Rosa Parks.

26
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:43,171
Now just wait till you see
what's become of our car.

27
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:46,106
Feast your eyes on this!

28
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,776
<i>Four-legged angel</i>

29
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:51,078
<i>Who will speak for you?</i>

30
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,747
<i>Raised in the rain</i>

31
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:57,017
<i>With no bone to chew</i>

32
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,154
<i>Well, maybe</i>

33
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:02,356
<i>Someone will love you</i>

34
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,924
Why are you showing me this?

35
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,092
I don't get it.

36
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,495
And I'm crying.

37
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,297
Lousy wrong channel.

38
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,301
The Legends of Demolition
Derby-Derby-Derby

39
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:16,136
are coming to Springfield
Springfield-Springfield!

40
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,705
So shut up!

41
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,139
And get your ass-ass-ass

42
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:22,042
over-over-over here-here-here!

43
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,377
Proceeds go

44
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:25,012
to stuttering
stuttering-stuttering.

45
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,581
Wait for it. Wait for it.

46
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:34,288
We've got all
the Demolition Derby greats!

47
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:36,190
Vince Dead Tooth McGee!

48
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:38,226
James Psychiatric Disorder
Porter.

49
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,460
Meth MacFarland.

50
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,495
Mysterious Fandango

51
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:44,131
and a very drunk Billy Joel.

52
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,034
I'm sorry, but most of
these names mean nothing to me.

53
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,702
Here it comes!

54
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:50,971
And making
his triumphant return

55
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,342
to the Crash Zone
after a full skull transplant,

56
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,710
Gene No Helmet Dupree!

57
00:02:56,744 --> 00:03:00,348
Eh? My car
in a demolition derby!

58
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:02,883
And we got primo tickets
for Saturday night.

59
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,685
Look at 'em fan.

60
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:05,986
Wait, wait, wait.

61
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,222
This is the point
where Lisa always ruins it.

62
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:09,357
No, I'm good with it.

63
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,524
People get out their aggression

64
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:12,826
and destroy carbon-burning cars.

65
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,161
See? Ruined it.

66
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,696
And then I noticed

67
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:19,166
there wasn't any more cinnamon
on top of my rice pudding.

68
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,369
And I said,
where's the cinnamon?

69
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:24,438
And they said, there never
was any cinnamon, Abe.

70
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:26,240
Fine, Dad, we'll get you
some cinnamon!

71
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:28,041
I can't tolerate cinnamon!

72
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,544
So, I started asking everyone
in the TV room

73
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:32,112
if they remembered the cinnamon,

74
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,181
and the answer
will surprise you.

75
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,916
The results were incon...

76
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,951
When did you get that put in?

77
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:39,953
Worth every penny.

78
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:42,723
But how many pennies is that?

79
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,758
Homer Simpson, you can't just...

80
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,206
All right, young'uns.

81
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,875
You know that movie Cars
that you likes?

82
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,212
Well,
all your favorite characters

83
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,915
is gonna commit suicide
here today.

84
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,149
What?

85
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,588
Ladies and gentlemen,

86
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:17,591
please silence all cell phones

87
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,994
and holster all truck nuts.

88
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:24,432
And now, in conformance with the
latest paleontological theories

89
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,667
about dinosaurs, please welcome

90
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,903
the all-new Truckasaurus Two.

91
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,675
I love you,
Steven Spielberg.

92
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,577
Now, a brief moment in memory

93
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,247
of those we lost
in the past week.

94
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,194
And now...

95
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,296
let the bash-'em-ups begin!

96
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,201
If I get hit by a brain,
can I keep it?

97
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,270
Be sure to get it signed
afterwards.

98
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,472
There's our car!

99
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,677
Without Dad's weight in it,
it really moves.

100
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:18,118
Oh, my God, this is it.

101
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,721
Only one car stands in our way.

102
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,623
It's down to Homer's Boner

103
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,224
and Car-rak Obama,

104
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:27,327
the Affordable Health Care
Mobile,

105
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:30,163
which you can't kill
no matter how hard you try.

106
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,739
My whole life has been leading
to this one moment.

107
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,210
My chest hurts!

108
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:44,378
That's called pride.

109
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:46,814
My arm is numb!

110
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:47,915
Numb with pride.

111
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:51,652
Son, I need to go
to the hospital.

112
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,623
Sure, Dad.

113
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,908
I missed it.

114
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:17,010
Can you see the pain
you're causing him?

115
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,346
Go on, git!

116
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,683
I'm sorry to say
it doesn't look good.

117
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:27,354
Homer, your father would like
to see you one last time.

118
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,290
I hope you've got a return
receipt on that balloon.

119
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,527
I always do.

120
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:37,364
Homer, there's something
I need to tell you.

121
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:41,368
I'll give you two a moment
in this semiprivate room.

122
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,537
Where is the nurse with my...

123
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:47,941
Son, I did a terrible thing
many years ago,

124
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:51,712
and I need you to forgive me
before...

125
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,214
before it's too late.

126
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,017
Anything, Dad.

127
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,660
You already said that part.

128
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:09,229
Remember, you can't tell anyone.

129
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,430
It's awful!

130
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,600
I swear. Now get to the point.

131
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,437
You didn't!

132
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,440
Okay.

133
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,009
I forgive you.

134
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:25,579
Your conscience is the one
clean thing in this room.

135
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:31,685
Well, we tried everything
we could...

136
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:33,153
and the last thing worked.

137
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,489
How did you save him?

138
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:37,290
When a body is
in too much pain,

139
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:40,460
the brain releases a hormone
to bring a merciful death.

140
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:43,664
But an expensive new drug
blocks that and keeps him alive.

141
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,533
What a glorious day!

142
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,334
I'm gonna live!

143
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:51,438
And my son has forgiven me
for the worst thing I ever did.

144
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,007
Yes. Forgiven.

145
00:07:55,809 --> 00:08:00,013
Sir, you just destroyed
a box of hospital cotton balls.

146
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:02,683
- That's $75,000.
- D'oh!

147
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,055
Now I want to watch
my favorite new show,

148
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:10,858
currently in its 17th season.

149
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:34,882
It looks like another murder
at Jackson Island Naval Base.

150
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:36,817
That's what makes America great.

151
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,553
Prompt investigation
of in-house naval crimes.

152
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:41,589
Homie, look who's here.

153
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:42,990
Yeah, I see.

154
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,058
Oh, Homer,
are you a Sunday puzzle?

155
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:47,728
'Cause you sure seem down
and a'cross.

156
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:50,564
My dad did something to me
I can never forgive.

157
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:52,532
No worse than what
God did to his son,

158
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,001
and they wrote a book together.

159
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,535
Bye.

160
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:58,872
He tricked me with his code blue
and his flatlining.

161
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,741
And I fell for it like a sap.

162
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,009
What did he do?

163
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,377
I promised him
not to say what he told me,

164
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,581
but I will never look at him
the same way again.

165
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:10,784
Yeah, but you forgave me, so
that means you have to love me.

166
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,087
Marjorie, I'm sorry,

167
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:17,024
but I do not want to be in
the same room with this man.

168
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,258
I'm going to Moe's.

169
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,760
Then I'm going to Moe's!

170
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,596
Then I'm staying here!

171
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,933
A gun and a sailor hat.

172
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,201
Nothing screams naval crime
more than that.

173
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,806
I'm going to Moe's.

174
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,776
I hate seeing a father and a son

175
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,577
sit at opposite ends of the bar.

176
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,446
'Cause it means
I got to walk more.

177
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:42,149
Now come on, youse guys.
Bury the old hatchet.

178
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,252
Hey, life is short.

179
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,154
You could be killed
by a drunk driver,

180
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,990
die of cirrhosis,
stabbed in a bar fight.

181
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,960
All kinds of random bad things
happen to my customers.

182
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,728
All right, look,
here's 50 cents, huh?

183
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,930
Play the jukebox
and the love tester.

184
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,934
<i>Hit the road, Jack</i>

185
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:02,435
<i>And don't you come back</i>

186
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:04,938
<i>No more, no more,
no more, no more</i>

187
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,907
<i>Hit the road...</i>

188
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,109
You heard Ray Charles.

189
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:12,112
Actually, in my jukebox,
we can't afford no Ray Charles.

190
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,247
It's a white guy named,
Charles Ray.

191
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,583
Excellent vision,
excellent vision.

192
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,787
Dad, Grampa, the place
we're going is the perfect way

193
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,789
to make you guys friends again.

194
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,857
I went there
for Janey's last birthday party.

195
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:25,659
You think
you can solve our problems

196
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,627
at a kids' birthday party place?

197
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:30,597
It's cheaper than therapy,
and it comes with cake.

198
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,467
If cake solved problems, Homer
would have a Nobel Peace Prize.

199
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,303
That's a bullcrap prize.

200
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,838
They gave it to Kissinger.

201
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,442
Welcome to the Escape Zone,

202
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,113
the latest attempt to get people
to save a dying mall.

203
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,648
Now, would you like
to be buried alive?

204
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:49,850
Done it for real.

205
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,952
How about Medieval Dungeon?

206
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,988
Got to be less torture
than listening to him. Hey.

207
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,189
Thank you.

208
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,859
Okay, you two are trapped
in a dungeon.

209
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:02,329
The only way out is to solve
ten puzzles by working together.

210
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,396
Yeah, whatever.

211
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,398
Super!

212
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,167
They're just sitting there.

213
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,469
I bet they'd hurry
if they knew we had balloons.

214
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,971
They're moving.

215
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:15,175
Son, if you take this sword and
stick it in that magic portal,

216
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,411
I think it might open
a bookcase somewhere.

217
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:21,581
Yes, that makes
perfect sense. I'll just...

218
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:30,223
Homer? You're not getting out
to say good-bye to your dad?

219
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,325
He's probably afraid
we'll see how much

220
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,327
the car lifts when he gets out.

221
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,064
No, I'm not.

222
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,699
There's only one way
to make you guys understand.

223
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,335
I'll tell you
what Grampa told me.

224
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,571
That was in confidence.

225
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:48,241
And in this family, we keep
our promises. Starting now.

226
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,277
I am telling!

227
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,546
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I hate conflict.

228
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:58,451
- Then just leave your body.
- Okay.

229
00:11:58,485 --> 00:11:59,719
Hey!

230
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:05,092
When I was growing up,
my dad loved to make

231
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,194
model World War II airplanes.

232
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,263
Watch it, son.
You're gonna break the wing.

233
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:12,732
Oh, now you got glue
up your nose.

234
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:15,668
Don't eat the decal.
How many have you had?

235
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,006
Just leave me be.

236
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:26,413
I work hard all week
at the model plane factory,

237
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,448
and this hobby is my one escape.

238
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,151
Can you please watch
this little monster?

239
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,786
When he gave me to her,

240
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,788
it was the best thing
he could've done.

241
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:36,790
- This is the dough.
- Dough.

242
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:41,494
Yes, dough. Now, I need someone
very strong to roll this out.

243
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,596
<i>Recipes</i>

244
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:48,802
<i>For the oven in my mind</i>

245
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,941
<i>3x5 cards with the recipes</i>

246
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,179
<i>Of my mother's pies</i>

247
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:03,183
<i>Apple cobbler</i>

248
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:06,053
<i>Peach pie, key lime,
and meringue</i>

249
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:13,493
<i>Pies made for me
by my mother</i>

250
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:17,697
<i>While my father
would harangue</i>

251
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,333
<i>Can it be that</i>

252
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:23,937
<i>It was all so tasty then?</i>

253
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,873
<i>Was her rhubarb</i>

254
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:29,176
<i>So sublime?</i>

255
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:31,111
<i>If we had the chance</i>

256
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,214
<i>To bake it all again</i>

257
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,916
<i>Tell me, would we?</i>

258
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,887
<i>Could we?</i>

259
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,056
Love you.

260
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,892
She loved me.

261
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:47,861
And for each pie she made,
she wrote down the recipe

262
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:50,563
and put a special note to me
on the back.

263
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:52,900
We don't know
what life will bring,

264
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:56,136
so on your birthday
or any day you need it,

265
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,638
you'll know
that your mother loved you

266
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,408
and have reasons
to love yourself.

267
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:05,178
You just taught me food is love.

268
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:08,148
I like myself.

269
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,849
That lunch box

270
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,784
was the most valuable
possession I ever had.

271
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,755
When she left,

272
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,258
those recipes
were all I had left of her.

273
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,227
And that's the end.
What a sweet story.

274
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,329
And there's some things
that shouldn't be gone into

275
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,098
until a man is dead
and can't be kicked.

276
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:27,034
After she ran away,
my father was furious

277
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,069
and did something terrible.

278
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,906
He threw my recipes
off a cliff.

279
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,909
Everything
that reminded him of her.

280
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,716
He lied to me.

281
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,287
He told me she took the recipes
with her when she left.

282
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,922
Are you sure, Daddy?

283
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:51,624
Yes. And don't ask me again
till I'm on my deathbed.

284
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,863
Wait.
Why are you looking like that?

285
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,099
If this man had had those notes,

286
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,234
his life
would've been different.

287
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:02,735
He would've had confidence.

288
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,804
He would've had
his mother with him!

289
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,606
I would've had hair!

290
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,808
Homie, that's not
very realistic.

291
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,278
And I would've been
more realistic.

292
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,648
Grampa, so thoughtless.

293
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:18,885
- Mean old man.
- His slippers don't even have bottoms anymore.

294
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,889
I never thought I'd say this
word, but here it comes, coot.

295
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,292
Homer, why are you smiling?

296
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:29,362
We're finally hating together
as a family.

297
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:33,733
What do you say we all go
to that home and yell at Grampa?

298
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,835
Oh, that would be lovely.

299
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,405
Now enjoy
this sweet song of hate.

300
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:42,509
<i>If I could save hate
in a bottle</i>

301
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:45,912
<i>The first thing
that I'd like to do</i>

302
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,481
<i>Is to hate every day</i>

303
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:51,451
<i>Till eternity passes away</i>

304
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:55,755
<i>Then end
with a giant screw you</i>

305
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,659
<i>But there never seems
to be enough time</i>

306
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,129
<i>To hate the things
you want to hate</i>

307
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:04,531
<i>Once you hate them</i>

308
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:11,471
- Lousy Grampa.
- So heartless.

309
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,806
Always calls me
buddy or fella.

310
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,176
Don't forget
he's hard of hearing.

311
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,011
Lousy Grampa!

312
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:19,779
So heartless!

313
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,149
What you did was crap, Grampa!

314
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:25,485
- I want to yell at him first.
- I want to yell at him first.

315
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:28,288
Hey, has anyone considered
the silent treatment?

316
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,157
The silent treatment
doesn't work.

317
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,193
It doesn't work.

318
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,795
It does not work.

319
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,997
Okay, fine, it works.

320
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,567
It works so well.

321
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,570
Please say something.

322
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,507
How long has it been?
Three months?

323
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,009
I don't even remember
a time before this.

324
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:54,347
Where's Grampa?

325
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:58,251
- He hasn't touched his lunch.
- Or his lunch meds.

326
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,687
My beloved family...

327
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,689
Oh, boy.

328
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,024
I've learned
an important lesson,

329
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:07,594
never get things
off your chest.

330
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:10,163
Which reminds me of a gal
named Chesty Lazar.

331
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:14,334
She ran a speakeasy on Hawaii
right before Pearl Harbor.

332
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,069
Pearl Harbor
was the name of the lady

333
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:17,737
who bought the joint...

334
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,540
Digression, digression...

335
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,243
Crazy talk...
Ah, here's the end.

336
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:24,577
The point is,

337
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:27,414
confessing don't really
make you feel better,

338
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:30,283
'cause it don't redo
the bad thing you did.

339
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:33,886
So I'm gonna undo what I done
if it's the last thing I do.

340
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:41,294
Oh, no. He's heading for that
cliff to look for those recipes.

341
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:42,895
I'm gonna find him, save him,

342
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:46,599
and tell him I can't wait
till he dies.

343
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,769
Leave me alone!
I'm gonna find it!

344
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,772
Don't do it, Dad!
Most is forgiven!

345
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,311
Wait, what's your rope tied to?

346
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:06,319
Oh, my God.

347
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,291
Please be okay. Please be okay.

348
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,505
Don't worry, son.

349
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:28,007
This will give you
all the rope you need.

350
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:33,112
Dad, no! I love you!
Mom left, but you were there.

351
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:35,482
Cranky, a little drunk,
sometimes not there,

352
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:37,317
but you were always there.

353
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,952
Oh, you love me.

354
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,854
That's all I need to hear.

355
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,430
Good thing I also threw out
your mother's bed when she left.

356
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:54,867
I can still smell her perfume.

357
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,869
And I've got the recipes back.

358
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:04,110
They're gone, just like Mom.

359
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,146
- I'm sorry, son.
- It's okay, Dad.

360
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,282
Life doesn't always give you
neat endings

361
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,150
that tie everything up in a bow.

362
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:17,524
This pie is fantastic.

363
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:20,960
It's what I imagine eating
great jazz would be like.

364
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,795
Always with the jazz.

365
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:26,399
It tastes exactly like
my mom used to make.

366
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,635
Exactly!

367
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,704
Excuse me, how the hell
did you get this recipe?

368
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,706
It was a miracle, actually.

369
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,076
33 years ago,
this place wasn't doing well,

370
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:40,046
possibly due to our location
under a cliff.

371
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,515
I went out to contemplate
my fate...

372
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:46,253
when, suddenly, like a gift
from God, the recipes came.

373
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,861
I'd never seen such recipes,

374
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:56,929
such brilliant
fruit combinations

375
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:59,266
and such beautiful messages
on the back.

376
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,738
Those messages were for me.

377
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:09,008
Well, then you should have them.

378
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,579
Everything tied up in a bow.

379
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:20,219
What's it say?

380
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,189
It says...

381
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,125
Your father is an okay guy.

382
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,896
- Thanks for telling me.
- Thanks for buying it.

383
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,436
Mr. Simpson,
based on your budget,

384
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:39,539
I am afraid there's only one car
on this lot you can afford.

385
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,541
You know this car?

386
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,410
Do I!

387
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:46,379
I thought
that's where you were.

388
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:49,616
Geez, what's wrong with her?
