What am I going to do?

146

Your infatuation is based

Talk to the woman, and you'll realize
you have nothing in common.

Barney, that is so insightful.
How did you come up with that?

152
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,359
Uh, I think we'll find we
have very little in common.

153
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:53,115
-Can't talk. Eating.
-Hey, my favorite--

154
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,449

Not me.

Well, gotta go.

going down together.

-I mean, getting off toge-- I mean--
-That's okay.

171
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,249
I'll just push the button
for the stimulator--

172
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,044
I mean, elevator.

Ah, home to my loving family.

185
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,041

Hi, Homer. Don't kiss me.
I'm all stuffed up.

-(groans)
-Hi, Dad.

189
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,418
Hi, son!
How are you-- Ew!

190
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,755
Dad, look.
I made fish sticks.

191
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,381
They're burned on the outside,
but they're frozen on the inside,

192
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,298
so it balances out.

193
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,056
Yeah, good.

00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,018

just you and me.

-Oh, that's sweet. (sniffling)

198
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,897
Guess what. There's
a new place at the mall

that puts your picture
on a t-shirt.

200
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,818
I got two dollars off
because mine got smeared.

201
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,448
Ew. Hey, we haven't
watched TV in a while.

I'm very tempted by another woman.

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,240
Homer Simpson,
that's a dilly of a pickle.

215
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,826
Hey, let's conference you
with Marge, huh?

216
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,501
No!

217
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,919
(groans, grunts)

218
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,343
-Who are you?
-Homer, I'm your guardian angel.

219
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:59,343
I've assumed the form of someone you would
recognize and revere, Sir Isaac Newton.

220
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,097
-Sir Isa-who?
-Oh, very well.

Colonel Klink!
Did you ever get my letters?

223
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,476
I'm not actually Colonel Klink.

224
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,481
-I'm just assuming his form.
-(chuckles)

225
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,444
Did you know Hogan had tunnels
all over your camp?

226
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,355
Homer! That's not
why I'm here.

227
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,525
My job is to show you
how miserable life would be

228
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,076
if you married Mindy
instead of Marge.

229
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,745
Ooh, I would live
in a big mansion?

-I as well.

00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,376
-Are you happy, Jeeves?
-Yes, sir. Quite.

233
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,715
-Then we're all happy.
-Let's get out of here.

Sure, life is good for you,
but what about Marge?

MARGE: Mmm.

-What is this place?
-The refuge of the damned.

249
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,400
A place where we can work
on our extra-credit assignments

250
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,321
without fear of reprisal.

251
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,938

Judging from your song,
you're infatuated

267
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,856

or a man named Andy.

-Dad, I'm not gonna fall for that.

Wow. If it weren't for this wall,
we'd be sleeping in the same bed.

Yeah. Uh, walls are a necessity

our temptation.

335
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,529
Good news, honey.
Two weeks are up.

336
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,986
You don't have to wear
your glasses anymore.

337
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,327
And your scalp
and posture seem fine.

338
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,502
Yes!
(grunts)

339
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,382
Kids, did anyone pray
for giant shoes?

340
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,420
-I did!
-Okilly-dokilly.

341
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,554
We've been doing a lot
of upper-body work on Bart.

342
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,972
-Today, let's pound his kidneys.
-Yeah.

343
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,471
-♪♪ (humming)
-Let's get-- Huh?

344
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,349
What gives?

345
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,143
Gentlemen, the nerd
you knew is dead.

346
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,518
Beat me, and you will be
beating one of your own.

347
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,356
-Whatever.
-(blows landing)

348
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,572
(electricity buzzing)

349
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,663
(chattering)

350
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,577
-So this stuff really works?
-Certainly does.

351
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,623
-Oh, well, lots of luck!
-Oh!

352
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,496
(snaps fingers)

353
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,383
(men muttering)

354
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,421
(rustling)

355
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,181
Thanks for poisoning
the planet, bastard!

356
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,183
-Get bent!
-No more Chernobyls!

357
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,265
Go to hell!

358
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,309
-(grunts)
-(man shouts)

359
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,523
You know, I was a little worried about
coming to this convention with you.

360
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,984
But I think as long as
we're not alone together--

361
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,975
MAN (on TV): <i>And now the moment</i>
<i>you've been waiting for.</i>

362
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,857
<i>This year's king and queen</i>
<i>of energy are...</i>

363
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:18,065
<i>Homer Simpson </i>
<i>and Mindy Simmons.</i>

364
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,737
-Huh?
-♪♪ (fanfare)

365
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,616
Homer, Mindy, you've just won a romantic
dinner alone at Madame Chao's,

366
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,285
the sexiest Chinese restaurant
in Capital City!

367
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,794
-Is there any way to get out of this?
-No.

368
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,427
(sighs)

369
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,312
What a perfect evening.

370
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,929
It was sure nice of them
to make us cheeseburgers.

371
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,187
Uh, yeah.

372
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,436
<i>(reading silently) "You will</i>
<i>find happiness with a new love."</i>

373
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,153
Oh, even the Chinese are against me.
(groans)

374
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,565
What's the point?
I can't fight fate.

375
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,704
(slurping)

376
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:03,491
{\an8}Hey, we're out of
these "new love" cookies.

377
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,117
{\an8}Well, open up the
"Stick with your wife" barrel.

378
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,875
Well, I guess
you'll wanna come in.

379
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,880
-Okay.
-"Okay."

380
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,472
This was a really
nice night, Homer.

381
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,468
Yeah, yeah.

382
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,340
(sobbing)

383
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:24,557
-What's wrong?
-Oh, yeah. Like you don't know.

384
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,180
-We're gonna have sex.
-Oh.

385
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:30,227
Well, we don't have to.

386
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,612
Yes, we do.
The cookie told me so.

387
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,860
Well, desserts
aren't always right.

388
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,574
But they're so sweet.

389
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,744
Homer,

390
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:44,453
you don't have to do anything
you don't want to.

391
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,407
Well, maybe I want to.

392
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,378
But then I think about
Marge and the kids.

393
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,379
Well, not the boy.
He drives me nuts.

394
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:58,261
-Sometimes I'd just like to--
-Homer,

395
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,890
you know how I feel,
so it's up to you.

396
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,810
