Nice to see you. Nice to meet you.

-Oh!

77

-Okay. Thanks for coming.

The fly was funny,

84
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,662
and the booger
was the icing on the cake.

85
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,583
Friends, we love you all,

86
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,412
but I also have
a sinister motive

87
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,868
for asking you all here--

88
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,998
sinister being Latin
for left-handed.

89
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,875

But enough joking.

90
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,342
-That was a joke?
-Shh!

91
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,131

92
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,175

to the pharmaceutical game.

-Leaving? I can't believe it.
-What's he talkin' about?

94
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:25,601

I had to wear for ten years.

97
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,807
Well, sir, like one out
of every nine Americans,

98
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,186
I'm left-handed,
and let me tell you

99
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,074
it ain't all peaches
and cream.

100
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,740
Your writing gets smeared,

101
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,989
Lord help you if you want to
drive a standard transmission.

102
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,451
-Amen to that.
-Well, sir,

103
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,781
I'm opening up
a one-stop store for southpaws.

104
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,786
Everything from
left-handed apple peelers

105
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,409
to left-handed zithers.

106
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,536
Going to call it
"The Leftorium."

107
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,583
-(oohs and ahhs)
-(applause)

108
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,342
So, Homer,
I'm dying to know.

109
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,842
What do you think
of The Leftorium?

110
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,383
It sounds like
a pretty dumb idea to me.

111
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,217
Well, I know it's
a little risky,

112
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,813
and it's going to be
a lot of hard work,

113
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,138
but, gosh darn it, it's going
to be a lot of fun too.

114
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,774
Fun? Where is this store,
Flanders?

115
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,482
The merry old Land of Oz?

116
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,522
Oh, no. The Springfield Mall.

117
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,855
-Oh, here, you two, make a wish.
-Nah!

118
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,651
-It's fun.
-No, it isn't.

119
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,645
Hey, you must have something
you want to wish for, Homer.

120
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,028
Hmm, let's see...

121
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,775
Nah.

122
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,037
Hmm...

123
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,329
-Hey!
-Come on, Homer.

124
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,423
I've got an ambition
to do some wishin'.

125
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,668
Keep your pants on,
Flanders!

126
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,791
I'm wishing as fast as I can!

127
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,628
Ooh!

128
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:43,054

129
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,264

130
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,255
Hmm...

131
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,256
Okay, ready.

132
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,814
Yes! Oh, yes!

133
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,153
Read it and weep!
In your face!

134
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,318
-I've got more chicken bone!
-What did you wish for, Homer?

135
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,028
No! No, no, no.
Don't say.

136
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,278
Otherwise,
it won't come true.

137
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,030
Ooh, that would be a shame.

138
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,077

Six-- seven if there's

Don't you think you should get a little
fresh air and maybe some exercise?

Yeah, but what are
you going to do?

160
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,258
Marge, TV gives so much
and asks so little.

some much-needed exercise.

181
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,385
Hey, Mom, how about
if I learn karate?

182
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,024
Will that make you happy?

183
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,730
That sounds fine, Bart.

184
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,610
See, Marge, you knock TV,
and then it helps you out.

185
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,608
I think you owe somebody
a little apology.

186
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,731
(grumbles)

187
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,400
(cries out)

188
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,488
Well, if it isn't
The Leftorium.

189
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,696
Hey, Flanders,
how's business?

190
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:17,957
Oh, a little pokey

191
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,289
but things are going
to pick up.

192
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,543

193
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,075
I am so sorry.

194
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,838
How much do I owe you?

195
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,170
Now, you put that money away.
That was an accident.

196
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,505
Really?

197
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,550
Well, thanks.

198
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,893
Could you validate my parking?

199
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,928
Absitively posolutely.
(chuckles)

200
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,313
So, Flanders,
have you sold anything?

201
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,730
Not yet, but one
of the mall security guards

202
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,439
took a good long look

203
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,690
-at a left-handed ice cream scoop.
-(scoffs)

204
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,652
Greetings, I am Akira,

205
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,282
your guide on the path
to true karate.

206
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,240
And this is our map,
<i>The Art of War</i> by Sun-Tzu.

207
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,121
It will teach us
our most important lesson.

208
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,949
We learn karate
so that we need never use it.

209
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,325
Um, excuse me sir.

210
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,291
I already know
how not to hit a guy.

211
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,252
Can we break out
the nunchukas?

212
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,832
Yes, the impetuousness
of youth.

213
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,628
-For now, let us read.
-Akira, my good man,

214
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,302
when do we break blocks
of ice with our heads?

215
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,841
First you must fill your head
with wisdom.

216
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,255
Then, you can hit ice with it.

217
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,643
Yo, Sensei,
can I go to the bathroom?

218
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,849
You can
if you believe you can.

219
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,600
Pay money to read books.

220
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,352
(scoffs)
The hell with this.

I'm telling you,

228
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,533
Flanders' store was dee-serted.

229
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:39,367
So, what do you think of your
bestest buddy now, Marge?

230
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,423
-(Marge grumbles)
-Dad, do you know what <i>schadenfreude</i> is?

231
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,288
No, I do not know
what <i>schadenfreude</i> is.

232
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,046
Please tell me,
because I'm dying to know.

233
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,629
It's a German term
for "shameful joy."

234
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,545
Taking pleasure
in the suffering of others.

235
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:57,473
Oh, come on, Lisa. I'm just
glad to see him fall flat on his butt.

236
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,675
He's usually all happy
and comfortable

237
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,015
and surrounded by loved ones,
and it makes me feel--

238
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,812
What's the opposite of that
"shameful joy" thing of yours?

239
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:05,935
{\an8}Sour grapes.

240
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,652
{\an8}Boy, those Germans have
a word for everything.

241
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,943
So Bart, what did you learn
in karate school today?

242
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,607
Yeah, come on, boy, this better
be worth my ten bucks.

243
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,526
Uh... I learned
the touch of death.

244
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,156
-Ooh, the touch of death.
-Permit me to demonstrate.

245
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,793
Lisa, shut your eyes.
Soon you will be at peace.

246
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,292
-Hey, quit it, Bart. Quit it. Hey!
-(Bart vocalizing)

247
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,464
Quit it! Quit it!
Quit it! Quit it! Mom!

248
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,053

of death on your sister.

How was class?

260

Today, we learned how
to rip a man's heart out

261
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,821
and show it to him
before he dies.

262

Hey, Flanders,
when are your busy hours?

Oh, I expect things to start
picking up soon.

270

"left as rain." (chuckles)

Lousy.
He just sits there all day.

for this just last year.

342

Twenty bucks. Take it or leave it.

00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,775
No cash for Neddy.
Homer keep all money.

345
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,985
Bye-bye, Neddy. Bye-bye.

346
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,985
(sighs)
All right, Homer.

347
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,577
-$20?
-$20.

348
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,042
-Now I don't want it.
-What?

349
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,172
I changed my mind.
It was a passing fancy.

350
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,499
Although, perhaps if you
threw in a few lawn chairs,

351
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:41,455
maybe that tool bench,
it might rekindle my interest.

352
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,144
Hey, Bartely-boobely.
Care for a steakarooni?

353
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,298
Sounds scrum-diddley-umptious,
dear old duddely-doodely.

354
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:52,557
-(laughing) Duddely-doodely.
-(both laugh)

355
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,061
Homer, this is the Flanders'
entire living room set.

356
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,564
How much did you pay
for this?

357
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,395
Only 75 beans.

358
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,280
$75? Ned must be desperate.

359
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,818
I'm sure you did nothing
to discourage this,

360
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,953
you scavenger of human misery.

361
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,370
Hey! Keep your hands off
my china hutch.

Good afternoon, sir.
I'm Chuck Ellis

365
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,166
from the Springfield
Collection Agency,

366
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,541
and I'm here to ask you
why you don't think

367
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,378
you need to pay your bills.

368
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,843
Oh, I know I need to pay them,
but there's just so many.

369
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,215
Does it make you feel good about
yourself to owe people money?

370
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,852
We've been very patient
with you, Mr. Flanders.

371
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,850
I know, but--
Wait a minute.

372
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,182
I'm Homer Simpson.

373
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,976
Ned Flanders lives over there.

374
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,400
-Oh.
-Flanders is in debt? Are you sure?

375
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,770
We don't make mistakes.

376
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,067
Damned right-handed ledgers.

377
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,781
-I can't write in these things.
-Why, there's a store where you--

378
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,662
-Hey, you said you're Homer Simpson?
-Yeah.

379
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,739
-See you on Thursday.
-D'oh!

380
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,954

going to give it to you.

Not anymore!

403
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,457
You punks are about to get

00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:51,466

C'mon Bart. Start them off
with the touch of death

413
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,528
and go from there.

414
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,741
I think they've learned
their lesson already, Lise.

415
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,872
No, we want to see

It's funny how two wrongs
sometimes make a right.

419
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,973
Homer! Over here.

420
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,967
Flanders, I want to give you
your stuff back.

421
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,308
Well, there's no house
to put it in, Homer.

422
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,864
Not since that nice fellow
from the bank--

423
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:48,318
who was only doing his job--
came and locked it up.

424
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,900
You're gonna live in your car?

425
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:53,065
Oh, no. It's just
a little camp-out tonight,

426
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,445
then off to my sister's
apartment in Capital City.

427
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,032

At times like these

442
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,856
I used to turn to the Bible
and find solace,

443
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,282
but even the good book

444
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,031
-can't help me now.
-Why not?

445
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,624
-I sold it to you for seven cents.
-Oh.

nothing's gone right.

a curse on me.

(sobbing)

450
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,165
It's all my fault.

451
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,094
-No, it's not.
-Yes, it is.

452
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,012
No! You tried to warn me

453
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,931
about gambling
my family's future

454
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,049
on some pig in a poke.

455
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,597
I didn't listen.

456
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,350
Homer, you were a true friend.

457
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,431
-No, I was a swine.
-(both sobbing)

458
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,807
-Listen, Flanders.
-What?

459
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,444
Do you still have that store?

460
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,941
For two more days.

461
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,232
Then it becomes
Libertarian Party headquarters.

462
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,187
I hope they have better luck
than I did.

463
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,448
Flanders, you open
that store tomorrow.

464
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,200
Oh, Homer, there's no point.

465
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,372
I said do it!

466
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,911
Hello, Jerry? Homer Simpson.

467
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,497
Remember last month
when I paid back that loan?

468
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,173
Well, now I need you
to do a favor for me.

469
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,923
A left-handed corkscrew?

470
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,126
Oh, baby!

471
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,675

-Tell him I went out.

475

He needs you

476
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,145
Ned Flanders is in trouble?

477
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,316
Smithers, I'm licked.

478
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,938
You open this can.

479
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,855
Okay, but you softened
it up for me, sir.

480
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,358
Hold it, Smithers.

481
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,156
-I'll open the can.
-But, sir, how?

482
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,619
To the mall!
I'll explain on the way.

483
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,039
Hurry, Neddy, hurry.
Oh, golly, it's a miracle.

484
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,131
HOMER:
Come on, ya' lefties.

485
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,303
Oh! What did I tell you?

486
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,010
-(chuckles)
-Homer?

487
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,470
It's all here,
and it's all backwards.

488
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,682
That's right.

490
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:32,398
Well, the worm has turned,
has it not, my tin-plated friend?

491
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,321
Look at you--
you who were once so proud.

492
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,150
Feel the wrath
of the left hand of Burns.

493
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,198
My life begins today.

494
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,332
Wow! What an icebreaker.

495

Wow!

499

The boys at the Diners Club
will think I've gone quite mad.

500
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,179

Homer, affordable tract housing
made us neighbors,
