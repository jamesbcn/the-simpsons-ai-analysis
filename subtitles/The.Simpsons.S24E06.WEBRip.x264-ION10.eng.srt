<i>Let me text Carl.</i>

173
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,917
So, uh, what are you
pullin' the ripcord with?

174
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,591
<i>Uh-oh. Maybe there's a ripcord app</i>
<i>I can use.</i>

175
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,172
(Homer hums happily)

176
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,470
MARGE: Homer, pay attention!

177
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,552
Huh? What?

178
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,597
Put that down! We're being audited.

179
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,142
The old stupid moustache'll win him over.

180
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,937
I'm really stupid.

181
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,610
Is that the myPad you're
claiming as a business expense?

182
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,109
-I'm standing by that.
-(groans)

183
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,534
Simpson!

184
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,330
Unhand your Edison slate

185
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,409

your gold-brickery to a caesura!

00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,915

-Hey, Dad!
-Dad, check this out!

194
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,770
-Dad, over here!
-Dad, a mother giraffe is giving birth!

195
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,939
Dad, look, I'm walking on
the wall around the lion pit.

196
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,268
Dad, the baby giraffe is
taking its first steps.

197
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,864
Dad, I'm walking on my hands,
and the lions think they're gonna eat me!

198
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,440
Will you kids pipe down?

199
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,275
I'm trying to get
"Churro-Chaser" to tell me

200
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,650
where the freshest churros are.

201
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,356
What country is Mexico in?

202
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,446
Dad, pay attention to your children.

203
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,123
Ugh, okay.

204
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,789
Aww. That'll be my screensaver.

205
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,963
-(yells)
-Just my arm.

206
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,303
-(yells)
-(chuckles) Gotcha!

207
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,379
-Why, you little...

208
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,434

(Tchaikovsky's <i>Pathétique</i> plays)

210
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,926
Homie, you want to read to Maggie
before she goes to sleep?

211
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,306
(scoffs)
A paper-based read-a-majig?

212
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,356
What are we, cavemen?

213
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,780
(imitates caveman grunting)

214
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,486
Sweetie, in the future
all you'll need is this.

215
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,994
Homie... it looks like you're putting

216
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,195
all your eggs in one basket.

217
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,786
What would you have me do?
One basket for each egg?

218
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,332
Hmm, I guess you're right.

219
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,785
I guess I'll have to scratch that off
the list of things I say.

220
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,127
Now, Maggie, let's find
a good game for us.

221
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,512
Hmm, "Krusty's Kosher Karnival..."

222
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,430
"Words with Enemies..."

223
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,548
"Don't Burn the Toast,"

224
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,045
"Lenny Dykstra's Prison Break..."

ooh, "Pizza Clock!"

226
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,224
Dough, sauce, cheese, topping.

227
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,597
Dough, sauce, cheese, topping.

228
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,393
Dough, sauce, cheese, topping.

229
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,147
Having fun, Maggie?

230
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,058
How long have I been playing?

231
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,477
Dough, sauce, cheese, topping.

232
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,436
So that's how you make a pizza?

233
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,986
Ooh, we really have been off-a the mark.

234
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,911
Mmm...

235
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,699
(raspy)
Dough, sauce, cheese, topping.

236
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:03,164
Dough, sauce, cheese, topping.

-Sauce, cheese, topping.

240
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,710
Flushy, go get help.

241
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:20,348
Homer, you're gonna be fine,
but there's no hope for the myPad.

242
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:24,769
(sobbing)
It still had 88% of its charge.

243
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,770
This is the part of the job I hate most.

244
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:30,442
Talking to crazy people.
(laughs)

245

Which of you is the YouTube

of the kid high on dentist's gas?

249
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,781
Is it you?

250
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,985
Is it... you? Is it you?

<i>(moaning)</i>

252
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,705
Oh, Lord, when things looked
darkest, you gave me light,

253
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,421
then you switched it off,
knowing full well

254
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,211
I had declined thy infernal Mapple Care.

255
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,585
Please grant me the wisdom to understand

256
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,973
your capricious nasty mind.

257
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,890
And please, please make the next
swing of the yo-yo an up. Amen.

258
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,392
ALL: Amen.

Everybody hear that?

261
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,192
Homer, Homer, it's a miracle.

262
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,525
Keep your pants on, Flanders.

263
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,900
(laughs) Oh, I will.

264
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,527
Till I go to bed and take
them off under the covers.

265
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,533
But come outside and see the miracle.

266
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,075
Has the myPad risen?

267
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,949
No, it's still where you buried it.

268
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,115
(Flanders humming)

269
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,624
Here it is, the Holy Ooze.

270
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,957
This is your miracle-- a tree?

271
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,502
Ooh, look at me, I turn sunlight
into complex sugars.

272
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,008
Big whoop.

273
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,259
Look a little closer.

274
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,130
Huh? "Hope."

275
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:43,507
Is this one of those coincidences
like Jesus on a tortilla,

276
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,506
or George Washington on a dollar bill?

277
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:49,188
Well, I like that its message
is in sap and not in blood.

278
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,938
Like some miracles I could mention.

279
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,440
(clears throat) Passover.

280
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,861
Well, this is how God would send
me a message: in my backyard,

281
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,901
hammock-adjacent,
one short word in large print.

282
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,356
What do you think he's trying
to tell me, Flanders?

283
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,447
Well, sir, if you ask me,
somebody up there is trying to tell you

284
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,043
that whatever flat tires
you've got in your life,

285
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,119
God's there with his little spare

286
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,825
and it enables you to drive real slow

287
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,365
till you get to the next station.

288
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,498
Don't eat the miracle.

289
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,745
Fine, I'll just go eat the body of God.

290
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,957
That's not crazy.

291
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,547
Ah, looks like you're really

292
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,886
turning something over
in your mind there, Homer.

293
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,351
Moe, I could believe
this was a random occurrence

294
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,732
or I could believe some
higher power reached down

295
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,060
and squeezed the sap out of that tree.

296
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,645
I'm choosing hope.

297
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,150
Moe, a bottle of your finest beer.

298
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,323
Here you go. Duff Adequate.

299
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,321
To hope!

300
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,913
Wow, no one's ever been happy
in this place before.

301
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,409
And when I started it was Moe's
Ice Cream Carnival-- not good.

302
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,163
(organ playing)

303
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,535
Of all the gifts the Lord gives us,

304
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,582
perhaps the greatest is hope.

305
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,627
Uh, excuse me, Reverend,
but I'm here to talk

306
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:02,222
about something a little
more important: hope.

307
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,589
But I was just... (sighs)

308
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,676
Oh, fine-- I can get an early start
on mountain biking.

309
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,722
Hope is here, people, and it's real.

310
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,726
It's not just inside the house of God,

311
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:15,019
it's outside the house of me.

312
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,574
So come and see the sticky brown truth.

313
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,028

Hmm. As promised, the miracle.

00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,423
Really? "Other"?

320
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,376
Cletus, what does that tree say?

321
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,086
Now, now, let's spell it out

322
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,676
like that social worker taught us to do.

Oh, it says hope!

326
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,357
Just like in <i>Hope Floats,</i> that
Sandra Bullock movie I wrote.

327

this so-called miracle.

329

{\an8}The idiotic things people believe in.

(crowd chattering)

333
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,672
A hundred dollar bill
for anyone who will give me

334
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,888
the truth behind this
so-called miracle tree.

335
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:32,099
I'll take your money.
The tree's a fraud.

336
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,231
I just got a hundred.
The tree is real!

337
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,019
What you got against hope anyway?

338
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,442
I bet something
disillusioned you as a child.

339
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,822

340
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,815

I'm on a break, kid,
and when I'm on a break,

346
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:05,884
the mouse is dead.

347
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,255
The mouse was a man.
His teeth were yellow.

348
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,394
His breath was rancid. My innocence
was lost in a plywood castle.

349
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,222
The castle is plywood?!

350
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,557
(groans)

351
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,903
<i>TV ANNOUNCER: Bumblebee Man</i>
<i>is moving to Channel 6.</i>

352
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,730
<i>Adios, ocho. </i>You no pay.

353
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,686
Uh-oh, he's got his own chimp.

354
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,066
-(chimp yelling)
-Señor Chango!

355
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,863
Teeny's a girl?

356
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,237
Oh, wait, he's just a bottom.

357
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,952
This is Kent Brockman at the site

358
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,995
of the so-called "Springfield Miracle."

359
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,423
The question is...

360
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,918
Is the hope tree a miracle?

361
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,500
Most decidedly not.

362
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,044
<i>Flying the Channel 6 traffic copter</i>

363
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,258
<i>without official clearance</i>
<i>and below legal levels,</i>

364
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,378
<i>we obtained the following footage.</i>

365
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,045
<i>As you can see here,</i>
<i>a shadowy figure emerges</i>

366
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,095
<i>from the darkness, walks up to the tree</i>

367
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,268
<i>in the Simpsons' backyard, and if</i>
<i>we freeze and zoom in on the image,</i>

368
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,638
We clearly see the figure
holding a syrup bottle

369
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,937
with which he writes the word "hope."

370
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,726
Supermarket maple syrup.

371
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,686
It was no miraculous tree of God,

372
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,066
and there is no hope
on Evergreen Terrace.

373
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:13,744
Just a run-of-the-mill,
syrup-spraying mystery man.

374
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,294
We can add this to the list of...

375
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,868
Kent's Closed Cases.

376
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,075
Would you please
get the segment straight?

377
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,626
Just lose the graphic. (groans)

378
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,880
<i>(groaning)</i>

379
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,501
It was all a hoax.

380
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,628
Let's burn our hats!

381
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,925
(chanting) Hope is dead! Burn the lies!

382
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,089
Thank God there's no alcohol in this bar,

383
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,508
or this place would really go up.

384
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,176
(groans)

385
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,104
-(groaning)
-Homie?

386
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,853
Aren't you going to come in?

387
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,944
I don't know what to believe anymore.

388
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,940
Maybe it's time to call Satan.
Is that a 212?

389
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,783
Don't call Satan.

390
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,988
So what if the message
wasn't the miracle.

391
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,280
The answer isn't in syrup
from God or a computer tablet.

392
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:59,035
The answer is that you hope
you felt was real.

393
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,959
Marge, up till now, I thought your hair
was just blue cotton candy,

394
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,670
but now I know
it's a solid loaf of brain.

395
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,592
Homie, you have such a way with foods.

396
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,551
Let's go inside.

397
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,682
Who do you think painted
the word on the tree?

398
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,139
No idea-- the important
thing is that they did.

399
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,601
Guess it must've been the person

400
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,850
