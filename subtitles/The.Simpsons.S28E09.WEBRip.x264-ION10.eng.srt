The old trapdoor was perfectly legal.

165

under the Reagan-era code.

166

But once you start renovating it,

167

168
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,697
Mm. And it has to be handicap accessible.

169
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,780

00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,287
But for now, we have left ourselves open

173
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,463
to a lawsuit by Homer Simpson.

174
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,212
Fine. Smithers,
go see this Simpson character

175
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,545
and trick him into signing
a waiver of liability.

176
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,720
I'll discuss things with the foreman.

177
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,263
(yelling) <i>Enrique, mas grande la puerta!</i>

178
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,595
(Homer moans)

179
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,520
{\an8}Look, Homie! We got three pieces together.

180
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,060
{\an8}That's a good day's work!

181
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,903
Why don't we do one of Maggie's puzzles?

182
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,308
Cow goes in the cow-shaped hole, boom.

183
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,437
Next case.

184
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,443
Hmm, I thought the one good thing
about you hurting yourself

185
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,066
was that we could spend
more time together.

186
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,824
-You did?
-Didn't you?

187
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,326
Oh, yeah, sure, of course.

188
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,328
Only a fool would admit otherwise.

189
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,081
-Mm....
-(doorbell rings)

190
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,174
-(sighs)
-(sighs)

191
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,880
Mr. Smithers! Come in, come in.

192
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,882
(chuckling)
Oh! Well, there's our tangle-foot!

193
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,634
-Already on the mend.
-Yeah, right.

194
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,847
They say it'll be three months
before I can scratch my ass.

195
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,719
Six before I can really go at it.

196
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,845
Listen, I-I don't want
to take up your time.

197
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,063
I just need Homer's signature
on a couple of things.

198
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,943
-First, a get-well card to himself.
-(Homer moans)

199
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,771
And what else does he need to sign?

200
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,276
Oh, a... (coughing)
...waiver of liability.

201
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,815
I know, I know.
There are solid reasons to sue.

202
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,195
But do you really want to fill your life
with parasitic attorneys

203
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,243
with get-rich-quick schemes?

204
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,287
Schemes? Rich? Quick?

205
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,211
Parasitic? Whoo-hoo!

206
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,959
How could I have forgotten
to sue Mr. Burns?

207
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,752
That's how you get rich in America.

208
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,165
Sue S. A! Sue S. A!

209
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,835
Oh, Lord.

210
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,433
Finally, a chance to use this.

211
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,799
It was designed ironically,
but I would die for it.

212
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,192
{\an8}<i>Are you home during the day</i>
<i>because you were injured at work,</i>

213
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,690
{\an8}<i>school, museum, church,</i>
<i>Iraq, elevator plummet,</i>

214
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,653

216
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,106
The first one! The first one you said!

217
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,906
{\an8}Call me, Maxwell Flinch,

218
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,540
{\an8}at 555-555-5555.

219
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,328
Five, five, five...

220
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,462
Wait, what was the number
after the first three fives,

221
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,169
but before the last six fives?

222
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,829
Uh, Simpson, before you do anything rash,

223
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,667
Mr. Burns wanted you to enjoy
this get-well cake.

224
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,213
-What's that writing on top?
-Oh!

225
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,838
It's just, uh, strawberry boilerplate
absolving us of liability.

226
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,176
Now just bite here, here, here,

227
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,852
nibble here, lick here.

228
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,270
Uh, your wife needs to eat this cupcake.

229
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,059
Sir, you cannot bribe me with cake.

230
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,654
Because I just ate several pies.

231
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,861
Hello, Mr. Smithers.
I see you haven't given up.

232
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,282
(sighs) Just enjoy the cake.

233
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,072
As long as you don't eat it
in front of a notary public, you're fine.

234
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,487
I'm a notary public.

235
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,195
You gave your ink pad to Maggie.

236
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,748
(moans)

237
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,331
-I'll, um, I'll walk out with you.
-Don't go yet.

238
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,377
You guys can help me brainstorm
a pattern for my new quilt.

239
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,882
Marge, I mean this in the nicest way--

240
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,054
your idea of fun makes me
want to blow my brains out.

241
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,224
(murmurs disappointedly)

242
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,468
Oh, Razzmatazz is perfect, Marge.

243
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,346
It's-it's uh-- it's red,

244
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,313
-but not, uh, too red.
-You're right!

245
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:49,194
Why don't you stick around and we'll
discuss stitching patterns over tea?

246
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,363
I'd like that.

247
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,611
And I'll take the cake back to the home
and share it with the seniors.

248
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,864
-Typical.
-I'll keep Dad company.

249
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:59,236
-Thank you, Bart.
-GRAMPA: (moaning) Oh, I dropped it.

250
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,946
Hey, wha-what did you put down my back?

251
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,247
Could be a tarantula,
could just be some yarn.

252
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,791
-I'll be at Milhouse's.
-(whining fearfully)

253
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,460
(sighs)

254
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,183
What the hell?

255
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,798
Oh, it's such a pleasure
to pour tea for someone

256
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,136
and not have to help him chew it.

257
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,682
We've made our choices.

258
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,685
And the world doesn't understand them,
but we do.

259
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,560
-Oh!
-Ew...

260
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,517
-Oh...
-Aw...

261
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,532
You know, Marge,
somehow I feel that more than anyone,

262
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:39,121
you understand those horrible words,
"What do you see in him?"

263
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,828
I never said this, but did you ever think

264
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,449
we cling to these guys

265
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,496
because we're afraid to admit
we were wrong?

266
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,330
Do you really think that?

267
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,956
Well, I've tried to use it constructively.

268
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,963
(Marge groans)

269
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,455
I try to have the serenity
to accept the things

270
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,588
I cannot change and the courage
to change the things I can.

271
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:02,136
HOMER: That's what they said to me
at that Alcoholics Unanimous meeting!

272
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,431

00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,774
LISA: Attention, bus riders!

274
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,349
My new seating plan avoids conflict

275
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,185
through the use of
complex social algorithms.

276
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,611
It teams up compatible seatmates

277
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,900
and places Milhouse with no one.

278
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,824
Yet somehow, I'm still a little scared.

279
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,993
Otto, why are you sitting in back?

280
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,992
Waiting for my assignment, chief.

281
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,244
-The driver's seat. You're the driver.
-Still me?

282
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,867
(scoffs) New management, same mistakes.

283
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,459
It's so quiet. I've never been
able to hear my music before.

284
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,634
<i>(rock music plays over headphones)</i>

285
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,553
Ooh, it sucks.

{\an8}My first PG-13 fantasy.

Since we haven't been able
to get a settlement,

00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,957
we'll have to start preparing you
for your deposition.

300
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,750
Caroline here will stand in
for the opposing attorney.

301
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,464
Good afternoon, Mr. Burns.

302
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,804
Release the hounds.

303
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,130
Uh, sir, you should try to project
a friendlier demeanor.

304
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,177
Release the hounds.

305
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,470
Please.

306
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:28,063
Seriously, sir, it would really be wise
not to mention the hounds.

307
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,930
Oh, that's like telling Three-Finger Brown

308
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,977
he can't play for the Brooklyn Tip-Tops.

309
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,101

310
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,438
Waylon, now I can see

311
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,533
why so many women in movies
have gay friends.

312
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,649
Like Princess Leia and C-3PO.

313
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,817
Listen, I made this for you.

314
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,776
(gasps) Oh, my God.

315
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,076
No one ever gives me a gift. Thank you.

316
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,040
No one ever tells me "thank you."

317
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,331
I think you see my true self.

318
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,585
The one I never pay attention to at all.

319
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,999
<i>(thinking) Oh, my God. I want to kiss him.</i>

-Come here, you.
-Okay, but... (exclaims)

You haven't gotten that
stupid signature yet?

333
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,652
No. And I'm not sure I want to.

334
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,441
You defy me?

335
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,534
Smithers, pour me a glass of water.

336
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,163
Now squeeze my chest.

337
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,330
(coughs)

338
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,328
Now, either get that signature

339
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,160
or you're in charge of restarting
our plant at Chernobyl.

340
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,996
