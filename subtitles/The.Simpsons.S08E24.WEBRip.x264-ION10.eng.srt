Hi. I'm Troy McClure.

You may remember me
from such TV spin-offs

{\an8}the producers of "The Simpsons"
with a simple request:

12
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:48,133
{\an8}35 new shows

{\an8}and the producers
weren't up to it.

16
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,765
{\an8}Instead, they churned out
three Simpsons spin-offs,

already popular characters

I've always been
a small-time hustler.

44
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,347

why I hired you

Hmm? Looks like you've already
got an enemy, Chief.

50
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:42,078
You know, folks around here don't
much care for law-and-order types.

51
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,172
Is that right? Well, maybe they'll
change their minds

a criminal by the name
of "Big Daddy" runs this town.

Big Daddy, eh?

00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,802
Well, he won't feel so big

if he messes
with Chief Wiggum, P.I. again,

73
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,770

he will.

Lucky for you,
this was just a warning gator.

She told me she was washing
her hair tonight.

178
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,347
Oh, I'm so desperately lonely.

00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,694

180
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,980
GRAMPA: <i>Aw, quit your bellyaching,</i>
<i>you big loser.</i>

181
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,355
Who...? Who said that?

182
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,071
<i>I did. It's me, Abe Simpson.</i>

183
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,072
But you're d-d-dead.

184
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:35,284
<i>I was, but I've come back...</i>

185
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,366

Dad, is that really you?

217
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,377
<i>Darn tootin',</i>
<i>you lousy fink.</i>

218
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,841
<i>You buried me naked</i>

219
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,511
<i>and sold my suit to buy</i>
<i>a ping-pong table.</i>

<i>-What kind of a son--</i>
-(electricity zaps)

Call me when you get
a karaoke machine.

00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:24,675
<i>That's the second time</i>

00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,347
(footsteps approaching)

225
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,555
I was just in a car accident.
Can I use your phone?

226
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,226
Using the phone's
a four-drink minimum.

227
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,074
(buzzing)

228
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,899
What's the matter?
I'm making as nice as I can.

229
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:37,284
<i>Test-lady. Test-lady.</i>

230
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,783
Go ahead, give it a try.

231
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,664
It goes by how clammy
your hands are.

232
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:44,041
Well, I suppose I could use
a laugh after that accident.

233
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,575
(bell dinging)

234
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,667
<i>Lovelorn. You need man.</i>

235
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,462
<i>Moe near now.</i>

236
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,666
<i>Go near Moe.</i>

237
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,625
-What?
-Go near Moe.

238
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,176
I'd say that's
a pretty strong endorsement.

239
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,850
So how about you and me
go out sometime?

240
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,258
You know, out back.

241
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,636
-(buzzing)
-I mean, out to dinner...

242
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,095
at a fancy
French restaurant?

243
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,314
<i>-Bing!</i>
-Sounds great.

244
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,105
And if this love tester
is as accurate as it looks,

245
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,439
maybe we'll be having
breakfast, too.

246
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,525
AUDIENCE: Wooo!

247
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,280
You did it, Grampa.

248
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,572
You really are a love expert.

249
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,065
<i>Dang right.</i>

250
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,277
<i>Fact is, I invented kissing.</i>

251
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,077
<i>It was during World War I,</i>

252
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,501
<i>and they were looking</i>

253
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,749
<i>for a new way</i>
<i>to spread germs.</i>

254
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,344
(canned laughter)

255
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,433
Sorry, Grampa, but I got
to stash you in the bathroom,

256
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,509
so Betty won't get wise to us.

257
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,934
<i>This is not the evening</i>
<i>I envisioned.</i>

258
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,477
Oh, jeez, she just got here.

259
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,650
Give me some advice, quick!

260
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,149
<i>You know, just be sweet,</i>
<i>pour on the honey, you know...</i>

261
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,281
Yeah, yeah, yeah, romantic.

262
00:12:56,358 --> 00:13:00,648
Ain't sunshine pretty,
ain't flowers stupid, I got you.

263
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,488
<i>(sighs)</i>

264
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,533
<i>I've suffered so long,</i>
<i>why can't I die?</i>

265
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,328
You know what's great
about you, Betty

266
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,951
is you're letting
your looks go gracefully.

267
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,498
You're not all hung-up

268
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,291
on looking attractive
and desirable.

269
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,875
It's just so rare
and refreshing.

270
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,170
So, Moe, tell me
a little about yourself.

271
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,625
Myself... uh... uh, jeez.

272
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,047
Um, I got to go
to the can again.

273
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,556
-Huh?
-I got the runs.

274
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,479
(grunting)

275
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,439
Hey! Get away from that!
Leave him alone!

276
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,940
-It said I was gay.
-(canned laughter)

277
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,772
You all right, Grampa?

278
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:41,697
<i>Oh... Daisy, Daisy...</i>

279
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:45,489
<i>give me your answer true...</i>

280
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,664
will you quit your clowning?
I need help here.

281
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:51,543
<i>Whoa, tell her her rump's</i>

282
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,962
<i>as big as the queen's</i>

283
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,801
<i>and twice as fragrant.</i>

284
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:58,878
Okay.

285
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:05,682
You are absolutely,
positively the dumbest

286
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,721
haunted love tester
that I have ever met.

287
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,015
(gasps)

288
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,769
What is going on in here?

289
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,311
Um, uh... Oh, gah...

290
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,976
I might as well
come clean with you.

291
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,815
I ain't too good
at talking to women,

292
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,900
and I really wanted
to do you,

293
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,606
so I brought along
the love tester to help me.

294
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,117
As you may have guessed,

295
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,448
it's inhabited by the ghost

296
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,243
of my friend's dead father.

297
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:35,286
Why, you conniving, devious,
monstrous, despicable...

298
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,254
sweet, little angel.

299
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,924
Look, Betty, if you just
give me a chance-- What?

300
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,594
I can't believe you went
to all that trouble for me.

301
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,684

-Mmm!

Mr. John Winslow.

00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,854
In our final spin-off tonight

315

the Simpson family
finally gets the chance

316
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,558
to show off
the full range of their talents.

317
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,436
Unfortunately, one family member
didn't want that chance

318
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,193
and refused to participate

319
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,145
but thanks
to some creative casting,

320
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,815
you won't even notice.

321
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,624

00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,736
Mr. Tim Conway.

350
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,035
(applause)

351
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,659
What's a Tim Conway?

352
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,866
Uh, 'bout 120 pounds.

353
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,075
(audience laughing)

354
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,047
<i>♪ It's the Simpson Family ♪</i>

355
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:31,258
<i>♪ Smile-Time Variety Hour! ♪</i>

356
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,944
You know, Homer,
we've all been busy as beavers

357
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,112
preparing for
our very own show.

358
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,111
Marge, have you ever imagined

359
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,113
what it would be like
if we really were beavers?

360
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:56,986
Yes, and it might look
something like this.

361
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,622
Honey I'm home.

362
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,076
(audience applauding
and cheering)

363
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,747
Hello, dear.
How was work at the plant?

364
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,796
It's not a plant, Marge.

365
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,130
It's a tree, and I've
nearly chewed through it.

366
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,256
Now, remember, my new boss

367
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,053
is coming home
for dinner tonight.

368
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,926
I know,
and I made your favorite:

369
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,104
-Stakes!
-(audience groaning)

370
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,353
-(applause)
-Hey, would you two close the dam door?

371
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,186
Bart!

372
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,361
-But that's where we live-- a dam!
-(laughter)

373
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:33,361
Look, everybody!
Maggie got her first tooth!

374
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,695
(laughter)

375
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,121
ALL:
Aw!

376
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,159
Okay, now,
before my boss comes,

377
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,954
there's something important
you should know.

378
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,367
(doorbell ringing)

379
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,365
In a minute, Homie.
I have to get the door.

380
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,997
-But, Marge!
-(gasping)

381
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,340
Uh, was it something I said?

382
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,594
Yarr! Someone should be
keelhauled for that one.

383
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,808
(boat whistle blowing)

384
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:03,428
I move that the last sketch
be stricken from the record.

385
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,937
Now, bring in the next offender.

386
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,150
Inflation, trade deficit,

387
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,111
horrible war atrocities--

388
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,361
How are we supposed to do
our big musical number

389
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,203
with so many problems
in the world?

390
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,199
Well, I know
one thing in this world

391
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,571
that's still pure and good.

392
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,617
Christian love?

393
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,990
No. Candy!

394
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,117
Sweet, sweet candy!

395
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,955
(Bo Diddley-style riff)

396
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,588
<i>♪ I want candy ♪</i>

397
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,050

to end world famine?

398

<i>♪ I want candy ♪</i>

399
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,720
Or save the endangered
Alaskan salmon.

<i>♪ I want candy ♪</i>

401
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,388
Well, if you won't think
of society's ills...

402
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,563
<i>♪ I want candy ♪</i>

403
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,232
At least think
of our dentist bills.

404
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:52,732
(twist-style riff)

405
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,646
<i>♪ Got a new dance,</i>

406

411
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,455

-Ow.

00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,932

413
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:21,928

421
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,078
(applause and cheering)

422
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:54,039
A poem, by Hans Moleman.

423
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:57,047
I think that
I shall never see,

424
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,550
my cataracts
are blinding me.

425
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,005
And they thought I stunk.

426
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,965
(steam whistles)

427
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,225
MARGE: Well, it's time
to say good night.

428
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,978
I wish our special guest
Tim Conway

429
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,520
didn't have
to leave so soon.

430
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,023
I'm still here.

431
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,685
Fox wouldn't spring
for a decent hotel room.

432
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,323
(audience
and performers laughing)

433
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,821
He's just kidding.

434
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,282
We'd like to thank Fox

435
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,992
and the good people
at Budget Lodge.

436
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,203
Well, that's all
the time we have

437
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,164
so, this is the Simpson family

438
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,124
saying, "As you walk down
that road of life..."

439
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,455
Hitchhike!
It's faster.

440
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,630
-ALL: Bart!
-(laughs)

441
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,499
We're like this all the time.

442
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,456
ALL:
Good night, everybody!

443
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:43,008
(cheering and applause)

444
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,893
That's it
for our spin-off showcase.

445
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,431
But what about the show
that started it all?

446
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,515
How do you keep "The Simpsons"
fresh and funny

447
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,020
after eight long years?

448
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,613
Well, here's what's on tap
for season nine:

449
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,979
Magic powers!

450
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,776
Wedding after wedding
after wedding.

451
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:04,201
And did someone say
long-lost triplets?

452
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,531
So, join America's favorite
TV family

453
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:11,157
and a tiny, green space alien
named Ozmodiar

454
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,166
that only homer can see

455
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,168
on Fox this fall.

456
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,170
It'll be out of this world,

457
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,002
right, Ozmodiar?

458
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,007
Damn straight,
Troy, my man.

459
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,469
TROY, OZMODIAR:
Good night, America!
