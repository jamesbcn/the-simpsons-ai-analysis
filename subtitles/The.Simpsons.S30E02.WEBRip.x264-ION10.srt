1
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:08,976
One month ago,

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,046
12 couples arrived
on this tropical island.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,182
After an emergency
balloon landing,

4
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:16,984
a jellyfish explosion
and the most-viewed

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,988
cantaloupe catapult accident
of all time,

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,023
just four couples remain.

7
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:26,160
I'm Tag Tuckerbag, and this
is the greatest adventure

8
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:28,429
to take place in just one place.

9
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:29,997
- The Amazing Place!
- The Amazing Place!

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,865
The Place Show.

11
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,236
The final challenge
is the Lily Pad Leap.

12
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:38,406
They haven't done the LP Leap
since season 22...

13
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,108
Beauty versus Sexy.

14
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:46,514
Kayla, don't step on the stem.
You'll flip the pad.

15
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,417
You should know that.
You're a life coach.

16
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:53,454
- They flipped the pad!
- They flipped the pad.

17
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,323
What a noob.

18
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:01,962
Hector and Audrey Chang,
you have won

19
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,398
The Amazing Place!

20
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:06,700
- Called it.
- Mom, you always call the winner.

21
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,202
How do you know?

22
00:01:08,236 --> 00:01:10,871
Well, your father may have
Moe's and football,

23
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,874
but I have being by myself
and this show.

24
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,643
Do you like adventure,
bandanas

25
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,945
and having your friends
see you melt down on TV?

26
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:23,083
We want you for season 48
of The Amazing Place.

27
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:25,653
Why don't you guys try out
for that show?

28
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:26,954
You would dominate.

29
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:29,123
Oh, no, I couldn't.

30
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:30,924
You know what they say,
you don't fail

31
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,894
at 100% of the shots
you don't take.

32
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,130
But you've watched
every episode of the show

33
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:38,299
and listened to
the director commentaries.

34
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:41,602
You even made us play
the terrible home game.

35
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:45,173
- Come on, Mom.
- Just try out.

36
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:47,074
- Come on, try out.
- Come on.

37
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,842
- Come on, try out.
- Try out.

38
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:50,311
- Try out.
- Try out, Mom.

39
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:53,113
- Try out!
- Try out!

40
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:55,115
- Come on, just do it, Mom!
- Come on!

41
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:57,251
Just try out!

42
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:58,752
- Come on.
- Mom.

43
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,521
- Just try out.
- Why don't you try out?

44
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,656
- Just try out.
- Come on, do it.

45
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,859
I'm not trying out,
so just can it.

46
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,431
I said can it
to my own children.

47
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,166
What have I become?

48
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,867
Baby, you've got
to tell them sometime.

49
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:15,169
Tell us what?

50
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:16,604
We know all the family secrets.

51
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,038
Like that Dad lost
our college funds

52
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:21,041
investing in a chain
of chewing tobacco cafes.

53
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,043
Dippin' Dens was a great idea.

54
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,479
We just weren't prepared
for all the spitting.

55
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:27,848
Well, I might as well
come clean.

56
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,521
The real tragedy
is now Chaw House owns

57
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:37,057
the entire
casual chewing market.

58
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,729
The truth is, we have tried out.

59
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,497
Dozens of times.

60
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,068
Why should you pick us
to be on The Amazing Place?

61
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,372
Because we're best friends
who never bicker.

62
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:55,008
We're constantly
at each other's throats.

63
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,579
We're motorcycle bikers.

64
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,180
That's our persona.

65
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:03,484
We have no idea what you want.

66
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,186
Just please pick us.

67
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,321
Why are you still doing this?

68
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:08,922
We were already on that show

69
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:11,058
where we had to crawl
into a drainage ditch.

70
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,361
That was just you,
and it wasn't a show.

71
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:15,062
It was a police bodycam.

72
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,064
That was a good show.

73
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:21,869
After 46 rejections,
I can take a hint.

74
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,904
They don't want us.

75
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,010
You know, reality shows
love a sob story,

76
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,547
and we've got a storage bin
full of tears.

77
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,716
And I've got a sister
who will edit them together

78
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,050
while I feed the dog
marshmallows

79
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,586
and see what happens.

80
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,069
Oh, we're not here
to make friends.

81
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:59,072
Unless I meet some awesome guy
who wants to be my friend.

82
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,942
Yeah, I met this really cool guy
at the boba place,

83
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,945
but he said he was moving
to Hong Kong and...

84
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,547
he didn't know his number yet.

85
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,050
Every reality show needs
that crazy, no-limits guy

86
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,820
that just shatters
society's taboos, right?

87
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,756
Well, break out
your pixelation machine,

88
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:19,993
because I am
your bug-eating nude fatso.

89
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:22,029
Oh, also, I'm not here
to make friends.

90
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh, my God, married kids?

91
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,302
You're in the show.

92
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:30,604
- No...
- We're here on behalf

93
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:32,172
of some different weirdos.

94
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,308
Our parents have tried out
for every season

95
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:35,976
of The Amazing Place.

96
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,411
My dad would even record
my mom

97
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:40,247
opening your letters
in case they got picked.

98
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,127
So think what a magical
TV moment it would be

99
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,930
for our mom to find out
she made it on the show.

100
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,532
After losing all hope.

101
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:01,168
When she didn't even know
she applied.

102
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:04,104
The ultimate superfan
gets one last chance

103
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,374
to make her dreams come true.

104
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:09,009
I don't know,
it sounds a little manipulative.

105
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,378
You're fired.

106
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:12,946
I think we just found
our Boston Rob.

107
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,016
Or your Springfield Clancy.

108
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,989
Electric bill, past due,

109
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,825
Website renewal
DippinDens.com.

110
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,026
What's this?

111
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:29,563
Congratulations,
Marge and Homer Simpson.

112
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:31,565
You have been selected
to compete on...

113
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:33,033
The Amazing Place!

114
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,869
Tag Tuckerbag?

115
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:37,070
Tag Buggernut?

116
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:39,039
This is it.
After years of rejection,

117
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,575
you two will finally compete
for a million dollars

118
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:43,577
on The Amazing Place.

119
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:45,646
But we didn't even try out.

120
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,815
I edited together
your old auditions.

121
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,083
And I gave notes
which were ignored.

122
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:55,088
My crazy dream is coming true.

123
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:57,825
After you sign
the amazing waivers.

124
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,993
So many ways to die.

125
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:04,097
Falling off rocks,
rocks falling on me.

126
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:05,933
Toxoplasmosis?

127
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,536
That's what ate
Handsome Tom's face.

128
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,004
Just call me Handsome Homer.

129
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,408
- Bye, Mom!
- Don't get toxoplasmosis!

130
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,714
Welcome to The Amazing Place.

131
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:23,250
You're about to embark
on a test of mental toughness,

132
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:25,085
physical strength and interviews
where you have to pretend

133
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,887
that you're in the middle
of a challenge

134
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,756
when it's already over.

135
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:32,693
But first, let's kick things off
with a romantic beachside luau

136
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,895
at Lover's Lagoon.

137
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:38,265
Right after
your first challenge.

138
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,367
We took one item
from every person's bag

139
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,870
and hid it in another
contestant's luggage.

140
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,974
Everyone, find their
Suitcase Stowaway now.

141
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,643
It's the ultimate
Tarmac Unpack Attack.

142
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:51,712
Okay, Suitcase Stowaway.

143
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,747
They've done this
three times before.

144
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:56,283
Here's the secret,
dump and dig.

145
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:58,285
I found my stowaway.

146
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:03,090
Great. Go through my other bag.

147
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:09,997
Okay, Homie, don't panic.

148
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,566
The secret is to just take
your time, and...

149
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,772
I'm sorry, Homer and Marge,
you've been...

150
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:21,174
- Don't say it.
- Shell-iminated.

151
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,510
No, no. No, no, no.

152
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,478
We can't be
the first couple kicked off.

153
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:26,980
That's the ultimate humiliation.

154
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,655
I never even put on a swimsuit.

155
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:37,157
I never got to see the lagoon.

156
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,494
I'm crying, and no one's
even filming me.

157
00:07:43,498 --> 00:07:46,100
We didn't even make it
off the tarmac.

158
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:48,636
All because of my screwup.

159
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,103
I guess we're going home.

160
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,672
No, you're going there.

161
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,043
A hotel? But we lost.

162
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,145
If we let you go home now,
fans would know

163
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,814
you've been kicked off
before the season airs.

164
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:03,851
So ejected contestants
must stay at this hotel

165
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,219
until every episode
is finished taping.

166
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,956
So we can't go home
for a month?

167
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,858
Six weeks, counting post.

168
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,160
I don't know what post is.

169
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,729
Hey, save some of those tears
for the reunion show.

170
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:19,633
You'll just put us in the back
row and won't ask any questions.

171
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,735
We won't even get
to hug the winner.

172
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:23,904
Yeah, but the runner-up's
always wandering around

173
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,505
looking for someone to hug.

174
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,807
That's your play.

175
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:30,678
How could I be such a noob?

176
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,681
I could learn
to love a noob, given time.

177
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:36,049
I already miss the kids.

178
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,351
Well, there's got to be
a way we can call home

179
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,153
without getting in trouble.

180
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,155
If you say anything
that reveals or implies

181
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,091
that you have been ejected
from The Amazing Place,

182
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,560
you are subject to a fine
of up to a million dollars

183
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:49,096
and, for residents of Georgia,
the death penalty.

184
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,400
Kids, kids, how are you?

185
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,102
Lisa said I can't use
the bubble bath,

186
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,670
but you said you bought it
for everybody.

187
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,005
Forget the bubble bath.

188
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,072
How's the show?

189
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,207
Are you winning?

190
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,043
I'm not supposed to say.

191
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,077
That means you're dominating.

192
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,713
I knew it!

193
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:06,947
No, no, we're not dominating.

194
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,516
I didn't reveal or imply that.

195
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,518
Well, you can't have gotten
kicked off yet.

196
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,986
You just got there.

197
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,426
Your mother and I are excited

198
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,729
to be part of the
Amazing Place family.

199
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,964
All further inquiries
should be submitted in writing

200
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,934
to Don DiBusco Productions,
Burbank, California.

201
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,736
What the hell
are you talking about?

202
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,470
This conversation
is hereby terminated.

203
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,106
You are each entitled
to one capful of bubble bath.

204
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:38,712
Now, that's parenting.

205
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:40,580
Come on, baby, it's not so bad.

206
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:42,382
Really?

207
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:47,955
Six weeks away from the kids,
Grampa, my sisters, your job.

208
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:51,558
With nothing to do but eat
free room service

209
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,062
and watch dopey movies on demand
while they keep us quiet

210
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,731
with an endless supply
of free booze.

211
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,232
It's a nightmare.

212
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,970
It is. It truly is.

213
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,806
<i>I was up late night ballin'</i>

214
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,075
<i>Countin' up hundreds
by the thousand</i>

215
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,343
<i>I was up late night ballin'</i>

216
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:11,979
<i>Countin' up hundreds
by the thousand</i>

217
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,947
You see, Curtis,
you never really

218
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:16,316
get an episode of SportsCenter

219
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,952
until you've seen it
for the third time.

220
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:21,088
Can I freshen up
that appetizer platter for you?

221
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,124
Nah, I better go
check in on my wife.

222
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:27,160
She's having a hard time
adjusting to hotel living.

223
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,001
Just let me clean.

224
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,973
Sweetie, I'm worried about you.

225
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,809
You just sit around
all day changing

226
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,711
the combination
on the room safe.

227
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:46,146
Do you want to put something
in the room safe?

228
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,948
I don't deserve valuables.

229
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,017
It's my fault we're stuck here.

230
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,819
All I deserve is to sit alone

231
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:54,955
and watch the TV channel
that's about the hotel.

232
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,990
Forgot your toothbrush?
No problem.

233
00:10:57,024 --> 00:11:00,961
Sundries gift shop has all the
toiletries every traveler needs.

234
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,097
Sundries is awesome.
I got this shirt there.

235
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,834
Look, I know you're miserable,

236
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:09,803
but let me show you how great
this place can be.

237
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:12,305
It's just a stupid chain hotel.

238
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:16,476
Darling, take my hand, and
you'll see it's so much more.

239
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,812
<i>Well, since you blew
the challenge</i>

240
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:21,081
<i>And we're not allowed
to tell</i>

241
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:24,084
<i>We're getting
all expenses paid at</i>

242
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,419
<i>Airport Hotel</i>

243
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,989
<i>The pillow's so foamy, baby</i>

244
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,024
<i>Order food on the phone-y</i>

245
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:35,595
<i>We'll eat Toblerone-y,
so don't cry</i>

246
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:38,165
<i>For breakfast
they have bagels</i>

247
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,333
<i>Cream cheese but no lox</i>

248
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:45,205
<i>A mini pack of cereal,
make a bowl out of the box</i>

249
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,574
<i>The pool's
so chlorine-y, baby</i>

250
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,376
<i>The towel's so teeny</i>

251
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:53,781
<i>No lifeguard to be seen-y,
we could die</i>

252
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:56,616
<i>No job, no kids, no Flanders</i>

253
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,718
<i>Choice of bar soap
or bath gel</i>

254
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,253
<i>Small ketchup's friends</i>

255
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,955
<i>With tiny mustard</i>

256
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:04,057
<i>Airport Hotel</i>

257
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:07,961
<i>Now that I've shown you, baby,
they'll leave us alone</i>

258
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:10,898
<i>Yeah, baby,
toilet's got a phone, yeah</i>

259
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,732
<i>Don't know why</i>

260
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:18,105
Might the lady enjoy a movie

261
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:21,942
whose title doesn't appear
on the bill?

262
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:32,786
Maybe being trapped here
isn't so bad.

263
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,555
I'm not even worried
about what the kids are up to.

264
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,893
- Come on, dig. Dig.
- We're hot.

265
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:42,229
You can go for a nice, cool swim

266
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,131
after you finish
digging my pool.

267
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:46,900
I'm telling Patty and Selma
what you're doing.

268
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,735
What? We want a pool.

269
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,804
I just got my first wax
in years.

270
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:53,373
Hurt so much they had to
give me an epidural.

271
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:03,116
The fitness center only had
an old NordicTrack,

272
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,985
but it felt good to work out.

273
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,988
I sat on a yoga ball
and drank cucumber water.

274
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,257
It's nice to know
I can still do that.

275
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,325
Maybe we should peek in.

276
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:15,595
I am kind of curious to see
what's going on in the show.

277
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,597
Really? You sure
you can handle it?

278
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,166
Oh, yeah.

279
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:24,037
I'm still in a great mood after
reading that free USA Today.

280
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:28,008
Look, they're
editing our episode.

281
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,978
There I am, looking
for that Suitcase Stowaway.

282
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:33,380
I never found it, did I?

283
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:36,149
Great.
Go through my other bag.

284
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:39,786
Hey, that's me
looking for that thing.

285
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,455
Okay. Marge's vitamins,
Marge's pajamas,

286
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,991
Marge's giant chocolate bar.

287
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:46,860
I didn't pack
a giant chocolate bar.

288
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,397
What Marge doesn't know

289
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,800
is that her husband just ate
her Suitcase Stowaway.

290
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,070
This ultimate didgeri-don't
will send them packing.

291
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:01,674
I'm not the one who screwed up.
You are.

292
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,176
I'm so sorry.

293
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,511
I know you're gonna
need some space,

294
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,046
so I'll sleep on the couch.

295
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:48,888
What a dump.

296
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,623
What's that from?

297
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,926
- What?
- What a dump.

298
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,361
How would I know?

299
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,897
We wouldn't be in this dump
if you weren't such a flop.

300
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,933
I'm tired, dear. It's late.

301
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,969
A chocolate flop.

302
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,371
Yes, a chocolate flop.

303
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,539
That's what you keep braying
at everybody.

304
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,108
I don't bray!

305
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,210
All right, you don't bray.

306
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,779
I do not bray!

307
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:14,247
I said you didn't bray.

308
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:15,548
Make me a drink.

309
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,784
- Haven't you had enough?
- Make me a drink.

310
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,753
Yes, dear.

311
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:23,556
And lay out some mixed nuts.
We've got guests.

312
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,759
- We've got what?
- Guests. Guests!

313
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,328
You know, what's-their-names.

314
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:29,596
I don't know their names.

315
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,564
They just got eliminated
from the show.

316
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:35,168
It took them five weeks,
not five minutes.

317
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,138
Go answer the door.

318
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,607
All right, love,
whatever love wants.

319
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,343
Get the door. The door!

320
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:44,777
I'm getting the door.

321
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,314
You don't have to bray
like some subhuman monster.

322
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:49,016
Oh, go to hell!

323
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:55,155
Hi! Hi, there. Come on in.

324
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,757
- This is...
- Honey.

325
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,826
And this is Nick.

326
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:02,162
Oh, I thought his name
was what's-his-name.

327
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:06,699
Just ignore Homer,
old sourpuss.

328
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,001
That's me.

329
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:10,970
Hey, sourpuss, why don't you
mix them a drink?

330
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,472
Yes, dear.

331
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,010
I love your room.

332
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:19,012
We have the exact same
paintings.

333
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:26,886
You were this close to winning
The Three-Legged Chase.

334
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:31,624
You were right in there, Nick,
right at the meat of things.

335
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,626
There's no limit to you,
is there?

336
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,363
And how would you have played
the Three-Legged Chase?

337
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,498
Why don't I show you?

338
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:42,135
- Don't encourage her.
- Encourage me.

339
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,211
Inside, outside,
inside, outside,

340
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:55,215
in, out, in, out,
in, out, in, out.

341
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,186
You can sit around
with the minibar gin

342
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,820
running out of your mouth.

343
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,091
You can tear me apart like
the box the shower cap came in.

344
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,659
That's perfectly okay,
that's all right.

345
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,361
You can stand it.

346
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,097
I cannot stand it!

347
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,864
You can stand it.

348
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,033
You married me for it.

349
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:17,337
- Our son is dead.
- No, he isn't.

350
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,140
- We have no son!
- Yes, we do!

351
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,709
Oh, yeah, Bart.

352
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,913
Man, last night sure was
a searing portrait

353
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,715
of a marriage in turmoil.

354
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:33,120
It's still in turmoil, you
chocolate-gobbling dream killer.

355
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:37,190
Attention, everyone, gather
by the bowl of mini yogurts.

356
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,559
For the first time ever
on The Amazing Place,

357
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,129
two eliminated contestants
will be brought back

358
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,863
to compete in the finale.

359
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:47,134
But here's the catch,
to get back in,

360
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:50,036
you have to dump your loved one
for another partner.

361
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,105
So, if your spouse screwed up,

362
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:54,040
this is your chance
to cut them loose.

363
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,309
It's the Dead Weight Drop.

364
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:01,148
I choose Nick.

365
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,949
That's got to sting, Homer.

366
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:04,984
I'm just glad
my friends and family

367
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,121
are never going to see me
humiliated like this.

368
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,427
This is it,
the final challenge.

369
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,763
Mango Tango.

370
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:19,065
First, pick and peel
enough fresh mango

371
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,168
to make six mango-ritas,

372
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:24,137
which you must then carry
across a log bridge.

373
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:28,107
But under the bridge is a pack
of mango-loving monkeys,

374
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,609
which can only be soothed

375
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:32,111
with music played
on a pennywhistle.

376
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:34,781
Also, there will be a
Kia Sportage in the background

377
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:37,116
that we couldn't figure out
how to fit into the challenge.

378
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,253
Your Mango Tango starts now.

379
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,955
And Marge draws first fruit.

380
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,925
I'll make the mango-ritas.

381
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,327
Great teamwork.

382
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,996
Could this be
a million-dollar puree?

383
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,665
I'll handle those monkeys.

384
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,808
It's the ultimate groovy
chill-out flute jam.

385
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,611
Look, the monkeys are mellowing.

386
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,914
This is our Kia Sportage Moment.

387
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,618
I did it.

388
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,953
We won. Without Homer.

389
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:17,490
Marge and Nick,

390
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:20,827
I want to congratulate you
on winning The Amazing Place.

391
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,995
I want to, but I can't.

392
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,635
Because you failed to salt
the rims of your mango-ritas,

393
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:32,138
rendering them mango-nothings.

394
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,174
I screwed up a recipe?

395
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,578
So get out of the way of the
actual winners, Shawn and Barry.

396
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:39,746
Hey!

397
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,949
Our rims are super salty.

398
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,588
Hey! Hey, hey, come on.

399
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:52,058
I am such a noob.

400
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:56,195
I am such a noob.

401
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,698
What a noob.

402
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,100
- Total noob.
- Classic noob.

403
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:05,037
Homie, I was such a jerk.
How can I make it up to you?

404
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:07,507
Sweetheart, you already have.

405
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,109
I am such a noob.

406
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:14,414
I've screwed up so many times
in our marriage,

407
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:17,350
and people always feel
so sorry for you.

408
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:21,220
But with this epic noob blunder,
I'm the one they pity.

409
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:25,358
Oh... pity.

410
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,594
Is this how you feel
all the time?

411
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:31,063
Kind of. I just never
let myself enjoy it.

412
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:34,567
Oh, pity feels good.

413
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:46,047
What should we watch next?

414
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,316
Ooh, I just heard about
a great new reality show.

415
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:52,785
PBS is showing a performance
of an Edward Albee play.

416
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:54,821
Sports talk it is.

417
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,825
How can you say that Phoenix
has any chance

418
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,493
to win the Western Conference?

419
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:02,061
What are you talking about?

420
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,597
We both picked the Phoenix Suns
to win it all.

421
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:06,466
Our Suns are dead.

422
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,501
No!
