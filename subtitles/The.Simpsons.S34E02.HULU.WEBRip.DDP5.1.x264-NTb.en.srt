on that thing all day.

184

185
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:10,245

"Marge in Charge"?

186
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:12,146
What happened to
Mrs. Marge Simpson?

187
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,060
I'm just getting tired of
the same old things.

188
00:08:15,056 --> 00:08:16,686
Like my last name?

189
00:08:16,693 --> 00:08:18,833
That was my gift to you
at our wedding.

190
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,371
It's just a user name.
You're overreacting.

191
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:23,511
- Oh, am I?
-(Marge grunting)

192
00:08:23,507 --> 00:08:25,577
Am I overreacting to my wife

193
00:08:25,578 --> 00:08:27,878
being taken in by a cult?

194
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,492
It's not a cult.
It's just a group of people

195
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:32,457
improving their lives,
paying money,

196
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:35,557
and slavishly following
a charismatic leader.

197
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:40,243

drinking that Kool-Aid.

198

Yeah, that's what
they all say.

201
00:08:57,441 --> 00:09:00,781
No, really.
I should not be on a jury.

202
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:02,991
Well, no one wants
to be on a jury.

203
00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:05,115
But I have a valid excuse.
I'm...

204
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:06,663
Ugh, I'm so sick of this.

205
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,760
People say their work
is too important,

206
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:10,504
or they have a vacation planned,

207
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,810
or they hate cops,
or they love cops,

208
00:09:12,805 --> 00:09:15,205
or they're secretly
eight years old.

209
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,410
But I am only eight years old.

210
00:09:17,414 --> 00:09:18,954
Just ignore that magazine,

211
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:21,061
and please take a good look
at me.

212
00:09:21,055 --> 00:09:24,025
What eight-year-old
wears pearls?

213
00:09:24,027 --> 00:09:27,637
You're being non-responsive
and borderline fascist.

214
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:30,035
So you claim
you're eight years old,

215
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,509
and you're using language
like that?

216

226

Oh, sweetie, don't worry.

227
00:10:01,636 --> 00:10:03,706
Yes, I may dream about him,

228
00:10:03,707 --> 00:10:05,577
spend most of my day
with him,

229
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:09,248
use up half our
disposable income on him.

230
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:11,821
But I'm married to you, Jesse.

231
00:10:11,823 --> 00:10:14,463
Homer! Homer, Homer.
I'm married to Homer.

232
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:17,131
Now, let's get to Jesse.
Sleep. Sleep.

233
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:20,274
Homer. Oh... Mmm.

234
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:21,583
Okay.

235
00:10:21,576 --> 00:10:23,406
What is that?

236
00:10:23,412 --> 00:10:27,292
Uh, it's a Pedalon
pillow scent.

237
00:10:27,287 --> 00:10:29,257
What's it called?

238
00:10:29,258 --> 00:10:33,328
Um, "Sweat Dreams, by Jesse."

239
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:39,043
Fine. I'm going to Moe's.

240
00:10:39,044 --> 00:10:41,584
Where the only exercise you get
is lifting a mug.

241
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,853
Sometimes Moe helps
with that, too.

242
00:10:43,854 --> 00:10:47,394
That's my big boy.
Only five more to go.

243
00:10:47,394 --> 00:10:49,364

244
00:10:49,364 --> 00:10:50,434
Aww.

245
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:52,743
Homer, what gives?
It's only Tuesday,

246
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:54,608
and you're drinking
like it's a Thursday.

247
00:10:54,609 --> 00:10:56,379
I got nothing
to go home to except

248
00:10:56,378 --> 00:10:58,648
except my incredibly fit wife.

249
00:10:59,853 --> 00:11:02,423

for her ride instructor.

250
00:11:02,424 --> 00:11:03,564
Eh, don't worry.

251
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,430
Those guys are losers
in real life.

252
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,000
Let me check out what they make.

253
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,710
$500,000?

254
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:11,776
I wish I was a ride instructor.

255
00:11:11,776 --> 00:11:14,046
Yeah, me, too.
Except for the bike riding,

256
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,777
and saying encouraging things.

257
00:11:15,784 --> 00:11:18,124
And I'm not allowed
to appear on the Internet

258
00:11:18,122 --> 00:11:20,592
without a big dot
in front of my face.

259
00:11:20,594 --> 00:11:22,334
Wow, that is an improvement.

260
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,770
Sure is gonna be hard
to go back to "No-Dot" Moe.

261
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:27,041
Just for that, I'll turn on

262
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,980
- the really harsh lighting.
- Turn it off.

263
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:32,819
Why can't she be happy
with the other instructors?

264
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:36,658
Like Vivica, or Jen S.
Or even Jen R.?

265
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,360
Why always Jesse?

266
00:11:38,362 --> 00:11:40,232
Oh, did you say Jesse?

267
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:43,343
- Jesse of Pedalon?
- You guys know him?

268
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:45,139
He is a damnation.

269
00:11:45,143 --> 00:11:47,653
Hey, you kiss your cross
with that mouth?

270
00:11:47,648 --> 00:11:49,278

found a healthy hobby.

to losing these... jurors?

357
00:15:18,302 --> 00:15:20,312
<i>That means thank you
for joining me.</i>

358
00:15:20,306 --> 00:15:22,776
<i>Today our pedal odyssey will
take us on</i>

359
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:24,618
<i>the Great Wall of China.</i>

360
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:28,185
So sit back, enjoy, and...
(speaks Mandarin)

361
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:30,689
<i>That means
remember to hydrate.</i>

362
00:15:30,694 --> 00:15:32,434
(exotic music continues)

363
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:36,872
<i>Behold the wonders of China.</i>

<i>Bitcoin mines,</i>

365

<i>forced labor camps where

366
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,393
<i>and romance.</i>

367
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:47,559
Marge, I know we've had
a tough few weeks,

368
00:15:47,561 --> 00:15:49,931
but I'm really gonna make
an effort to be good

369
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:51,142
till you're not mad.

370
00:15:51,135 --> 00:15:53,065
Then I'll go back
to the way I was.

371
00:15:53,072 --> 00:15:54,782
<i>JESSE:
That's it, feel the burn.</i>

372
00:15:54,775 --> 00:15:57,175
<i>Feel you, feel me.</i>

373
00:15:58,984 --> 00:16:01,864
Let's take him down.

374
00:16:01,856 --> 00:16:03,386
You got to be more specific, Homer.

375
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:05,602
We hate lots of guys
in this bar.

376
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:08,037
I know who he means. Jesse.

377
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:09,335
If we did have sex,

378
00:16:09,337 --> 00:16:11,477
my wife would be
thinking of him.

379
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:14,375
And hypothetically,
I'd be furious.

380
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:16,851
When that guy tried
to steal Marge,

381
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:19,863
he woke the wrong
sleeping fatso.

382
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:22,159
I just have to find him.

383
00:16:22,163 --> 00:16:24,003
I can tell you where he is.

384
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,140
What? How?

385
00:16:25,136 --> 00:16:26,366
You know how the Church says

386
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:28,911
we don't share
any information?

387
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,850
It's a lie. Google bought us
six years ago,

388
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,250
so here you are.

389
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:38,864
I'm gonna put a foot-shaped dent
in his beautiful ass.

390
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,934
Defense, closing statement.

391
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:42,914
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

392
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:44,835
consider everything you've seen,

393
00:16:44,842 --> 00:16:46,882
and beyond a shadow of a doubt,

394
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,050
you will vote guilty.

395
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,920
You're the not guilty guy.

396
00:16:50,921 --> 00:16:52,861
Uh, wha-what?

397
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:54,158
Gol-dang it.

398
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,060
Now, if there are
no further statements...

399
00:16:56,064 --> 00:16:57,604
I have a statement.

400
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:59,101
This is highly irregular,

401
00:16:59,104 --> 00:17:01,174
but I'm very bored,
so I'll allow it.

402
00:17:01,174 --> 00:17:03,884
Thank you. I didn't want
to be on this jury.

403
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,320
I didn't think
I was mature enough

404
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,986
to decide a criminal case.

405
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:10,186
But after seeing the nonsense
that goes on in this courtroom,

406
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:12,462
well, you should be ashamed.

407
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:15,273
And, Your Honor,
I find you guilty

408
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:18,379
of criminal indifference
and playing <i>Wordle</i>

409
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,805
on the bench.

410
00:17:19,812 --> 00:17:22,452
"Bench."
That's what it is.

411
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,960
Ah, juror number six.
Lisa Simpson.

412
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:26,256
Yes, Judge?

413
00:17:26,258 --> 00:17:28,898
I find you in contempt
of court.

414
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:30,697
Bailiff, take her away.

415
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:33,511
Now the forewoman is gonna be
the Crazy Cat Lady.

416
00:17:33,506 --> 00:17:34,876
(gibbering):
I want to take a vote.

417
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,275
No, too soon!
Take a vote...

418
00:17:36,278 --> 00:17:37,508
(spouting gibberish)

419
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:40,424
Kitty's going to...
What was it? Guilty, guilty.

420
00:17:42,524 --> 00:17:45,134
And that leaves 11 jurors.
It's a mistrial.

421
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:46,829
The defendant can go free.

422
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,643
