Wow.

181
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,562
How much? How much?

182
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,897
Well, here's what
they're asking.

183
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,901
I can't afford that.

184
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,195
Dad, I have a problem.

185
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,568
Why did you come to me?

186
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,776
I don't know nothing.

187
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,985
I used to get by on my looks.

188
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,576
Now they're gone,

189
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,161
withered away
like an old piece of fruit.

190
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,287
(sobbing)

191
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,004
-Are you done?
-No, not yet.

192
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:08,415
I was voted the handsomest boy
in Albany, New York.

193
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,836
Dad, I don't need advice.

194
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,184
I need $15,000 to buy a home.

195
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,180
Oh, well,
all I own is this house

196
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,973
that I built
with my own two hands.

197
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,677
You didn't build this house.

198
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,597
You won it in
a crooked '50s game show.

199
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:25,016
I ratted on everybody
and got off scot-free.

200
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,066
Ha ha!

201
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,858
All right, son.

202
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,202
I'll sell this dump
and write you a check.

203
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,659
Dad, first you gave me life.

204
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,239
Now you've given me
a home for my family.

205
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,735
I'd be honored
if you came to live with us.

206
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,118
Thank you.

207
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,415
How long before you ship Grampa
off to the old folks home?

208
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,422
About three weeks.

209
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,053
(laughing)

210
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,596
Maggie, I'll give you
this cookie if you talk.

211
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,853

212
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,515
D'oh!

213
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,984
All right, you win round seven.

214
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,023
When are we gonna get
to my first word?

215
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,857
-Your what what?
-My first word!

216
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,493
You don't want
to hear that story.

217
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,700
I know. I'll tell you
about the time

218
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,700
I got locked in the bank vault
with Mr. Mooney.

219
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,702
It was another one
of my harebrained schemes.

220
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,704
-Dad!
-Wait a minute.

221
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,576
That was a <i>Lucy Show.</i>
Okay, where were we?

222
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,134
Mom was preggers, and Dad just
threw our money down this sinkhole.

223
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,298
Ah, yes,
I remember the day

224

Oh, Bart, you met
Grandma Flanders.

354
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,323
Hope she didn't scare you.

355
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,029
Hello, Joe.

00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,899
Little Lisa...

358
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,908
I've already started you
a college fund

359
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,700
at Lincoln Savings and Loan.

360
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:36,413
{\an8}According to this magazine,
Bart might be jealous of her.

361
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,665
Yeah, well, Bart can kiss
my hairy, yellow butt.

362
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:43,288
From now on,
the baby sleeps in the crib.

363
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,047

370
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,891
Bart, there's someone in here
who wants to meet you.

371
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,359
Well, Bart, what do you
think of little Lisa?

372
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,948
I hate you.

373
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:21,368
I saved this newspaper
from the day Lisa was born.

374
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,747
"Mondale to Hart:
'Where's the beef?'"

375
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,205
"Where's the beef?"

376
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,245
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

377
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,087

378
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,933

No wonder he won Minnesota.

Everyone agreed that Lisa
was a beautiful baby.

380
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,140
