Or my 13-week option
is not picked up.

177
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:24,054
I shall take no wife,
hold no lands, and father no children,

178
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,708
except for the wife and house
and kids I'm already stuck with.

179
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,927
I shall wear
no other beer's crowns.

180
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,599
I am the six-pack hidden
in Daddy's secret cabinet.

181
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,969
I put the "fest" in Oktoberfest

182
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,637
and sell for eight bucks
at ballparks,

183
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:42,646
though I have nothing to offer
but my suds, head and beers,

184
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,440
and promotional cozies,

185
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:48,284
for this night
and all the nights to come.

186
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:59,083

And here's a painting
of my ancestor, Ichabod Duff,

194
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,109
crossing the Duffaware River.

195
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,113
Ah, hell, this is all BS.

196
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,655
Duffman was a fascist icon
my grandfather repurposed

197
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,369
'cause he couldn't get the damn rights
to Woody Woodpecker.

198
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,700
Mr. Duff,
can I ask what's in this safe?

199
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:42,246
Little lady, inside that safe
is the formula for Duff itself,

200
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,041
known only to three people--

201
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:48,165
me, Condoleezza Rice,
and my brother-in-law Terry.

202
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,974
And the combination
is not known to any human...

203
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,468
Uh, what the...?

204
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,260
"Schlitz plus water."

205
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,183
Why don't you kids run off
and play in the bottle cap pit?

206
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,973
Don't cut yourselves!

207
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,556
Mr. Duff,
I want to say something.

208
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,232
I'm proud of my husband,

209
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,651
but I'm not sure if this is something
Homie should be doing.

210
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,481
Just what do you mean?

211
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,066
Well,
aren't you making him a superhero

212
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,282
so that beer looks cool to kids?

213
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,782
(laughs)

214
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,065
Uh, Marge,

215
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,408
let me tell you a little
something about beer.

216
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,913
Do you know why man stopped
running around,

217
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,576
lassoing mastodons,
and became civilized?

218
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,825
No.

219
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,336
So he could grow hops
and make beer.

220
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,169
-It's true.
-Oh.

221
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,844
Our beer has helped people
celebrate weddings.

222
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,133
Enjoy a good game.

223
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,426
Ease the pain
of a lost loved one.

224
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,140
That's the tradition
your husband will inherit.

225
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,851
Geez, now you make me
want to drink it.

226
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,272
Attagirl, have a designer bag.

227
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,692
Now, Homer, there is one thing
we needed to do in private.

228
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:48,652
Okay, what...?

229
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,651
Ow!

230
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,032
Hey, that's not my butt!

231
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,688
We've injected a chip in you

232
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,237
that detects the slightest presence

233
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,780
of alcohol in your blood.

234
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,123
You see, Duffman cannot drink.

235
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,199
(laughing)
What? That's funny.

236
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,655
I thought you just said
that Duffman can't drink.

237
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,956
(laughs)

238
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,669
But that would be crazy.

239
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,419
They all fight it at first.

240
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,251
(laughs)

241
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,506
You wouldn't tell Batman
he couldn't eat bats.

242
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,839
When you're Duffman,
you're at work, Homer.

243
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,835
You wouldn't go to the nuclear plant
drunk, would you?

244
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,848
Uh...

245
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,520
Well, uh...

246
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,598
My husband won't have
any problem not drinking.

247
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,055
Yeah...

248
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,064
The only reason he wanted
to become Duffman

249
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,106
was to be respected and beloved.

250
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,570
Uh...

251
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,650
And what better way to do that
than to be stone-cold sober?

252
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:37,947
(moans)

253
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,950
When my husband
put on that costume,

254
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,952
he didn't just
put on a sleeveless shirt

255
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,714
that says "Duff" on it
and a cape for some reason,

256
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,498
he put on responsibility.

257
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:51,041
And boots that I don't think
will hold up in the rain.

258
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,877
But the point is--
it's not about being drunk,

259
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,553
it's about being someone.

260
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,552
You're right, Marge.

261
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:03,104
I will do something no one has
ever done-- be fun sober.

262
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,890
What a crisp
and refreshing attitude.

263
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,897
Hey, this stuff is pretty good.

264
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,694
Mmm, foamy Marge.

265
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,987
(babbling)

266
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,405
Uh, that's the chip.

267
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,580
No drinking.

268
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,408
I was licking my wife.

269
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,414
Can you believe they
put a chip in my arm,

270
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,707
and I can't drink beer?

271
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,920
-Ah.
-Ah, gee, tough break.

272
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,131
Maybe Moe could dig it out
with a corkscrew.

273
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,211
Yeah.

274
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,126
Oh, I would love that,
Homer, I really would.

275
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,684
But then Duff might take away
my neon sign,

276
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,139
and, uh, it's the only thing
lighting the bar.

277
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,929
BARNEY:
Whoa, creepy.

278
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,354
(Bart and Lisa laugh
mischievously)

279
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,023
Stop shooting those at each other.

280
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,482
Relax, honey, no one's ever
been killed by a T-shirt cannon.

281
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,534
Oh, no, it's the 5:00 blahs.

282
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,538
CLOCKS:
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

283
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,961
Help us, Duffman!

284
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,120

285
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,128

286
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,169
Drink Duff!

288
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,879
Care to team up with Fruit Batman?

289
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,134
I'm thinking of dumping
Kid Sourpuss here.

290
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:26,138
I'm a hero.
Oh, I can see my obituary now.

Turns out, men like men

308

selling them beer.

309
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,284
Why did it take us 142 years
to discover this?

310
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,954
Because executives are
incompetent, sir?

311
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,873
Well, then why do I have so many?

312
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,622

Oh, uh, no,
that was a, uh, "whoa!"

00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,429
(chuckling)
Oh.

321
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,984
Give the whole
lower bowl a raise.

322
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,516
Uh, welcome aboard, Duffman.

323
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,484
Fair warning now-- at the end,

324
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,574
I just might ask
for an autograph for my son.

325
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,240
Here you go-- they're all pre-signed.
With nicknames.

326
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,570
Buddy, Sport, Tiger, Red.

327
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,315
Uh, give me a "Red."

328
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,617
I'll start calling him that now,

329
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,830
and then give it to him
on his birthday.

330
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,831
Now, where to, sir?

331
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,373
Oh, this is a romantic night.

332
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,076
How about everywhere?

333
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,246
All right.

334
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,924
Navigator,
set a course for everywhere.

335
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,093
Where the hell is that?

336
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,671
I said everywhere!

337
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,380
Now, Homer,
look through the beeriscope,

338
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,388
and gaze upon the wonderful world

339
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,010
that you and Duff have created.

340
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,031
Captain, it never dawned on me

341
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,405
beer could have such a dark side.

342
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,833
You must be talking about
new Duff Stout.

343
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,872
Take us down.

344
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,365
I have to think.

345
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,166
To be honest, you said
you wanted to go everywhere.

346
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,540
So we ran out of fuel
an hour ago,

347
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,798
but I didn't want
to disappoint you,

348
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,340
so I will toss down a tow rope.

349
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,755
Hey, come here. Man...

350
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,595
Uh... this is not good.

351
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,361
(sighs)
Marge, do you ever worry

352
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,190
that you made
a giant mistake in your life?

353
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,236
Oh, um...

354
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,950
I need a little context.

355
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,120
Not drinking beer has given me
the clearness of mind

356
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,120
to realize drinking beer is bad.

357
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,043
I've got to undo what I've done.

358
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,212
Hey, how you doing?

359
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,382
(dance music playing)

360
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:48,171
Is this the most outrageous party
you've ever been to?

361
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,047
(cheering, affirming)

362
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,554
Well, guess what.

363
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:55,425
You've all been served nothing
but nonalcoholic Duff.

364
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,894
(spectators gasping)

365
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,734
BARNEY:
Then why am I throwing up right now?

366
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,400
As Duffman, I had the power

367
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:04,398
<i>to switch the beer trucks</i>
<i>working this race.</i>

368
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,241
(screams)

369
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,831
So you see, you don't need beer
to have a good time.

370
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,488
Join Duffman today in saying,

371
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,668
"I've had enough
of that life-ruining Duff!"

372
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,669
Why the hell did you do this?

373
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,171
Because Duffman is a hero.

374
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,052
And with great taste
comes great responsibility.

375
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,010
Well, "hero," here come your fans.

376
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,511
(shouting indistinctly)

377
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,973
(yelps)

378
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,183
-(engine starts)
-So long, suckers!

379
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,513
(laughing maniacally)

380
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,649
What the...?!

381
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,059
So long, suckers!

382
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,897
(Homer laughing maniacally)

383
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,113
What the...?!

384
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,283
It's a circle.

385
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,700
So the answer is--
go in reverse.

386
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,070
So long, suckers.

387
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,526
(Homer laughing maniacally)

388
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,656
What the...?!

389
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,412
I'm not sure
how many more times

390
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,504
we can watch Dad chased down
by an angry crowd

391
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,290
before it affects us psychologically.

392
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,293
As a family therapist,
I can assure you

393
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,835
that you have
all the coping skills you need.

394
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Why is Lisa talking to an empty seat?

395
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,915
See you next Tuesday, Dr. Schulman.

396
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,837
Oh, right.
You're in Maui.

397
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,927
(whimpers)

398
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,431
Hey, my beer.

399
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,433
(screams)

400
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,484
(panting frantically)

401
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,848
(gargling)

402
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,646
Get him back in uniform.

403
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,112
Hmm.

404
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,321
Homer, now, listen to me.

405
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,860
You're in a stadium
surrounded by people

406
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,355
who want to kill you.

407
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,696
They don't have the guts.

408
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,872
Ow.

409
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,160
Now, there's one way
out of your hell.

410
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,704
Prove you still love beer.

411
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,788
Drink this with gusto.

412
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,293
B-But the chip.

413
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,705
There never was a chip.

414
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,883
It was all the power of suggestion.

415
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,172
You tricked me!

416
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,505
And I trusted you
after you snuck up

417
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,220
and injected me
without my consent.

418
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,551
Just drink the beer, pretty boy.

419
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,637
Whatever you do,
you'll be my hero.

420
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,936
Now you're pushing it.

421
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:08,768
Homie, it's time to go.

422
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,106
Come on, come on.

423
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,990
Give me the beer inside you!

424
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,398
Oi.

425
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,491
This place seems
even sadder than before.

426
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,704
Uh, yeah, well,
I kind of gloomed it up a little

427
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,794
while you were gone.

428
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,163
Nothing to see here, sunshine.

429
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,327
(sighs)

430
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,325
(slurring)
H-Hey, y-you used to be Duffman.

431
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,248
Can I get a picture with you?

432
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,586
(gasps)
I finally made it.

433
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,592
I'm a has-been.

434
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,344
Yeah, I guess you're right.

435
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,636
Ah, let's make it official, eh?

436
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,268
Aw...

437
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,611
Oh, yeah.

438
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,229
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

439
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,777
Sir, may I interest you
in a French hazelnut latte

440
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,281
and an Iggy Azalea CD?

441
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,782
I'm not here for three-buck coffee.

442
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,775
I'm here to ask you
to be Duffman again.

443
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,448
And to use the bathroom.

444
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,156
I don't know what you're
talking about, sir.

445
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:09,036
Fine, can you tell me
where your travel mugs are?

446
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,134
Yeah, over there.

447
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,089
Come on, Barry, I know it's you.

448
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,420
Sorry, H.K.,
I traded in my beer goggles

449
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,505
for coffee-grinding pince-nez.

450
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,141
Are you telling me
you don't miss the big time?

451
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,849
The girls on the side,
the corporate jet?

452
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,520
There's talk of an animated series.

453
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,099
Duffman would like a job
where he could phone it in.

454
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,436
You just called yourself Duffman.

455
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,361
Duffman never took off his tights!

456
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,321
Let's go, girls!

457
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,111
But we're managers here.

458
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,655
They learned the register
better than me! Oh, yeah!

459
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,159
Oh, yeah!

460
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,960
