so I bought 400 cans.

181
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,411
Marge, your penny-pinching
rampage has gone too far.

182
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,166
Oh, honey,
I know it's not easy,

183
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,248
but we've got
to put money away.

184
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,289
You can't enjoy money
when you're dead,

185
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,249
so why not
have fun now?

186
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,607
Don't you think
you've had enough "fun"?

187
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,402
Last year
you spent $5,000
on donuts,

188
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,842
$2,000 on
scalp massages,

189
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,048
$500 on
body glitter...

190
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,650
Hey, I earned
that money.

191
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,006
While you lounge
around here,

192
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,923
Doing laundry and
putting up drywall,

193
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,843
I'm at work
busting my hump.

194
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,565
Oh, please!

195
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,644
From what I hear,
you waltz in there at 10:30,

196
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,165
take a nap
on the toilet,

197
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,641
then sit around
googling your own
name until lunch.

198
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,960
(GASPS) Who told you that?

199
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,248
You shouted it
while we were
making love!

200
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,481
Now, look here,
mister.

201
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,847
I pay the bills,
I do the budget,

202
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,968
and I'm in charge
of the money.

203
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,121
Hmm!
Hmm!

204
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,885
Are you going to let her
push you around?

205
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,531
Yeah, show that skirt
who's boss, see?

206
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,489
Give us
our independence, Homer.

207
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,046
Yes, President Franklin.

208
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,327
I was never president.

209
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,727
I invented some kind of stove.

210
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,485
Well, I invented a Popsicle
made of Mountain Dew.

211
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,841
Sweet.

212
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,365
Yeah, yeah,
that's swell.

You banged?

217
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,970
Did you spend
our savings
on a motor home?

218
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,324
No. I spent our savings
on the down payment
for a motor home.

219
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,164
I need a castle
where I can be king!

220
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,761
VVell, I hope
you enjoy it,
Your Majesty,

221
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,002

speaking to you.

Damn it!

224
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,129
Kids, your mother
and I have decided

225
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,964
to take
a little break
from each other.

226
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,645
While we deal
with our issues,

227
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,451
I plan to go on
<i>Motor Home Makeover</i>

228
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,522
and trick this thing
out like a palace,

229
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,450
not like that dump
you live in.

230
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,126
All I need is for
someone to start
a show called

231
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,406
<i>Motor Home Makeover!</i>

232
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,006
I see. You were mad enough
to leave our house,

233
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,242
but not mad enough
to leave our property.

234
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,771
That's my
half-assed dad.

235
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,689
Hey, I couldn't leave
you kids.

236
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,165
You're like
my own family.

237
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,044
Now check
this place out.

238
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,171
Neat! When I sleep
at Dad's, I call this bed.

239
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,890
You can have it.
This one's way better.

240
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,121
That's a bread compartment.

241

You're a bread

00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,167
