00:07:49,606 --> 00:07:51,336
Aw!

177
00:07:51,342 --> 00:07:53,482
(gasps) You love me.

178
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:55,649
Oh, Maggie!

179
00:07:55,785 --> 00:07:58,685
Uh, Marge, you're in this
game world all the time now,

180
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,831
so I'm trying to dry my pants
in the microwave.

181
00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:03,668
Should I set it on "potato"
or "popcorn"?

182
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:07,677
Homie, Maggie just said
"I love you" to me.

183
00:08:07,675 --> 00:08:09,975
I never thought I'd hear it
for the first time

184
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,020
in a massively multiplayer
online roleplaying game,

185
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:16,661
but I'll never forget it.

186
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,800
Wait, in this game
Maggie can talk?

187
00:08:18,797 --> 00:08:21,397
There's so many things
I've wanted to ask a baby.

188
00:08:21,402 --> 00:08:23,112
Why do you make eye contact
when you poop?

189
00:08:23,206 --> 00:08:24,906
Do you remember
when I lost you at Home Depot?

190
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,650
Where do faces go
during peekaboo?

191
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:29,988
Maggie heart doughnut man?

192
00:08:29,986 --> 00:08:31,656
But I'm doughnut man!

193
00:08:31,656 --> 00:08:33,426
She loves me.
She loves me!

194
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:35,426
One of my three kids loves me!

195
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,900
Whee...!

196
00:08:38,002 --> 00:08:39,442
(laughs)

197
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,739
Stupid art school.

198
00:08:41,743 --> 00:08:42,553
(grunts)

199
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:44,445
We're gonna have
gum-proof floors,

200
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:45,748
acoustics that
make second graders

201
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:47,321
sound like sixth graders.

202
00:08:47,421 --> 00:08:48,961
And the ceiling's
gonna be so high,

203
00:08:48,957 --> 00:08:52,057
our resident opera ghoul won't
bump his head on the rafters.

204
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,896
Ouch!

205
00:08:55,003 --> 00:08:58,313
Seymour, where on earth
did you find the money for this?

206
00:08:58,443 --> 00:09:01,083
Um, look at
the parent donation thermometer.

207
00:09:01,182 --> 00:09:02,522
(chuckles)

208
00:09:02,618 --> 00:09:05,688
Ah, well, the thermometer
doesn't lie.

209
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:09,597
You wanted to see me, sir?

210
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:12,539
- We both wanted to see you.
- Martin,

211
00:09:12,538 --> 00:09:14,708
when you run a business,
as we are,

212
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:16,749
you need a product and a market

213
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,620
and a workforce
that isn't full of...

214
00:09:18,717 --> 00:09:21,687
- Jive-ass snitches.
- I'm sorry?

215
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:25,460
We've heard you're gonna sing
to your parents about this...

216
00:09:25,463 --> 00:09:27,233
victimless thing of ours.

217
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:31,344
I-I have signed a mutual
honesty compact with them.

218
00:09:31,442 --> 00:09:33,412
Oh, look, your report card.

219
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:35,324
Beautiful little A
you've got here.

220
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:36,786
(whimpers)

221
00:09:36,787 --> 00:09:39,427
Would be a shame
if something happened to it.

222
00:09:39,526 --> 00:09:41,226
God, no!

223
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:43,632
You sick bastard.

224
00:09:43,634 --> 00:09:47,544
Okay, okay. I'll keep
your dirty video game secret.

225
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:50,412
Oh, man is wolf to man.

226
00:09:50,514 --> 00:09:52,424
(cries)

227
00:09:52,518 --> 00:09:54,488
Skinner, are you feeling this?

228
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:58,958
I know it's insane,
but we're like a team.

229
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:01,374
Working together,
shared interests,

230
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,968
we're more than a team.

231
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:04,512
We're colleagues.

232
00:10:04,609 --> 00:10:06,249
Would you like to
put your feet up on my desk

233
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:08,175
as we daydream about our goals?

234
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:14,262
(helicopter blades whirring)

235
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:16,031
(chuckles)

236
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:18,071
(both sigh)

237
00:10:21,776 --> 00:10:24,716
And top salesperson of the day
goes to...

238
00:10:24,716 --> 00:10:27,786
Sherri, who unloaded
150 rainbow mohawks

239
00:10:27,788 --> 00:10:30,158
at ten Bobux a pop.

240
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:31,903
(cheering)

241
00:10:31,997 --> 00:10:33,467
Couple more days like that,

242
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,367
and you're getting
the trip to Honolulu.

243
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,340
(gasps)

244
00:10:36,438 --> 00:10:37,438
This is new.

245
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,850
An ice cream truck.

246
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:42,546
Wait, they're shooting
ice cream at us.

247
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:45,122
(grunting)

248
00:10:45,223 --> 00:10:47,733
BART:
It's an ice cream drive-by. Run!

249
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:49,428
(Milhouse panting)

250
00:10:49,532 --> 00:10:52,402
Oh, no. It's a trap.

251
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,650
(Bart yells)

252
00:10:56,746 --> 00:10:58,846
Not unicorns.

253
00:10:58,851 --> 00:11:02,021
They're my second-favorite
magical horse.

254
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,938
JIMBO:
"Boblox belongs to us."

255
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:11,635
People, looks like
we've got ourselves a turf war.

256
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:13,953
(grunting)

257
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:22,196
- Bad news,
we've got competition.
- Who?

258
00:11:22,197 --> 00:11:27,237
The Sunflower gang's IP address
belongs to some place called...

259
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,610
Limitless Frontier Horizons.

260
00:11:29,746 --> 00:11:30,846
Hmm, what do you know?

261
00:11:30,848 --> 00:11:33,348
The Montessori School.

262
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:43,436
Check out
the fancy groundskeepers.

263
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:46,749
Those aren't groundskeepers.
They're parent volunteers.

264
00:11:46,846 --> 00:11:49,546
Pay for tuition,
then work for free.

265
00:11:49,652 --> 00:11:51,522
What a racket.

266
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:53,393
(grumbles)

267
00:11:53,492 --> 00:11:55,432
Good morning,
Principal Skinner.

268
00:11:55,531 --> 00:11:57,331
Hello, "kids-call-you-Sandra."

269
00:11:57,334 --> 00:11:59,474
Um... (clears throat)
maybe you're not aware of this,

270
00:11:59,572 --> 00:12:01,812
but, uh, some of your students
have been interfering

271
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:05,453
with some of my kids', um,
independent study project.

272
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,320
Ooh, I'd love to help, but
our curriculum is student-led.

273
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:12,204
So if their passion is the
monetization of coding errors,

274
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:15,197
it's part of our core belief
system that I support them.

275
00:12:15,303 --> 00:12:19,043
That's, uh, progressive school
mumbo jumbo for "screw you."

276
00:12:19,144 --> 00:12:22,184
You can't tell me
you want war with us.

277
00:12:22,317 --> 00:12:25,617
Um, well, "can't"
is a word we don't use here.

278
00:12:25,624 --> 00:12:28,434
We also don't say "don't."
We just can't.

279
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,270
Are you even in charge?

280
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:32,196
No! I just send out emails

281
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:34,813
trying to convince parents
there's a plan to all this.

282
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:37,519
Oh, please come to
our silent auction next week.

283
00:12:37,515 --> 00:12:39,545
One of our dads is Drake.

284
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:41,862
He'll emcee but not perform.

285
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,990
(sighs) That'll be all, Sandra.

286
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:47,404
Oh, that is a really nice tower,
Truth-Anne.

287
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
Yeah, yeah, they're all nice.

288
00:12:49,505 --> 00:12:50,975
Let's take a walk.

289
00:12:51,075 --> 00:12:53,705
Let me show you
what I've built here.

290
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,194
From day one, these curiosity
seekers have been told

291
00:12:56,185 --> 00:12:58,955
they can succeed at
anything they set their mind to.

292
00:12:59,057 --> 00:13:01,427
Do you think you can win
against that unbreakable,

293
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:03,303
unearned self-confidence?

294
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:07,107
Look, there's room in
the Boblox scam for both of us.

295
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,880
You take the gumdrop fields
and teddy bear bouncy rooms.

296
00:13:09,979 --> 00:13:12,379
We keep the penguin fun land
and the mushroom castles.

297
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:16,364
Well, sharing is one of
the habits of the heart.

298
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,798
We accept.

299
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:20,825
(chuckles) Can you excuse us
for a moment?

300
00:13:22,972 --> 00:13:25,012
What the hell are you doing?

301
00:13:25,109 --> 00:13:27,009
What? We had to make a deal.

302
00:13:27,113 --> 00:13:29,953
With only half the money,
there's no revolving stage,

303
00:13:29,952 --> 00:13:31,892
no flying wire harness system.

304
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,890
Good luck doing
<i>Angels in America.</i>

305
00:13:33,894 --> 00:13:35,904
We can't go to war
with these psychos.

306
00:13:35,998 --> 00:13:37,768
Their self-esteem
is off the charts.

307
00:13:37,868 --> 00:13:39,098
Take the deal.

308
00:13:39,204 --> 00:13:41,344
(groans)

309
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,920
So, fellow lifelong learners,
do we have an understanding?

310
00:13:46,018 --> 00:13:48,658
Yes, uh, we have
an understanding.

311
00:13:48,757 --> 00:13:50,327
Understand this:

312
00:13:50,326 --> 00:13:53,466
"When you come at the king,
you best not miss."

313
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:56,267
(chuckles): You're going
to quote The Wire to me?

314
00:13:56,271 --> 00:14:00,181
My dad directed three episodes
in the dockyards season.

315
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:03,089
That season was slow, and also:

316
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:05,759
This. Is. War.

317
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:07,058
(groans)

318
00:14:14,307 --> 00:14:16,547
Look, we can still get
a deal with these guys.

319
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:18,246
- Let's just go
back in there and...
- You're out.

320
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:19,719
- What?
- You don't have the stones

321
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:21,589
for the mohawk trade.

322
00:14:21,723 --> 00:14:23,263
You can't fire me.

323
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:25,759
You're right, people
who are fired get a severance.

324
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:27,644
You get nothing.

325
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:29,835
This is my grift.
I brought you in.

326
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:31,679
It's all in the game, son.

327
00:14:31,676 --> 00:14:35,276
All in the video game game.

328
00:14:35,283 --> 00:14:37,823
Those self-esteem punks
are gunning for us.

329
00:14:37,822 --> 00:14:39,992
I need a ruthless,
bloodthirsty general.

330
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:43,596
- Milhouse, you're up.
- (spits, coughs)

331
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,510
Me? But what about Bart?

332
00:14:46,506 --> 00:14:48,136
(scoffs) He's history,

333
00:14:48,142 --> 00:14:49,952
and this school
doesn't teach history.

334
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:52,416
Do it and you'll never
have to play dodgeball again.

335
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:55,917
And I get the pretty teacher
for fifth grade.

336
00:14:56,024 --> 00:14:59,834
- Mrs. McCarthy?
- You know who I'm talking about.

337
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,242
Mm. Ms. Tanaka.

338
00:15:03,874 --> 00:15:05,944
Let's hit these sunflowers
where it hurts.

339
00:15:05,944 --> 00:15:09,384
They steal our princess tiaras,
we kill their unicorns.

340
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,849
They strangle our gnomes,

341
00:15:10,854 --> 00:15:12,694
we glitter-bomb
their pumpkin patch.

342
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:14,662
So get out there
and paint the streets

343
00:15:14,662 --> 00:15:16,902
with the blood
of tomorrow's leaders.

344
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,040
ASTRID AND FRENCH FRY:
Let's talk Boblox!

345
00:15:19,171 --> 00:15:21,541
Hey, everybody!
It's me, Astrid.

346
00:15:21,643 --> 00:15:23,553
And it's me, French Fry!

347
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,317
- Hi, Astrid.
- Hi, French Fry.

348
00:15:25,316 --> 00:15:27,786
Have you been seeing
all this craziness in <i>Boblox?</i>

349
00:15:27,888 --> 00:15:29,418
It's so crazy.

350
00:15:29,424 --> 00:15:30,964
The Springfield kids
were selling mohawks,

351
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:32,971
but so were
the Montessori Sunflower kids,

352
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,535
so they got in a gang war.

353
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:37,435
Everyone is being so grouchy,
makes me sad.

354
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,810
Check out what happened
to the Springfield kids

355
00:15:39,912 --> 00:15:41,282
at the Candyland.

356
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,323
I like bears,
but this one looks mean.

357
00:15:44,321 --> 00:15:46,131
(growling)

358
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,195
- Aah!
- Ew. He was mean.

359
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:50,225
You are always right
about bears.

360
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,196
Don't ever rip me in half,
French Fry.

361
00:15:52,303 --> 00:15:54,843
(gasps) I would never, Astrid.

362
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:56,752
<i>BOTH: Online friends forever!</i>

363
00:15:56,746 --> 00:15:59,416
Oh, look, it's a fashion show.

364
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,257
I love fashion shows.

365
00:16:01,355 --> 00:16:03,825
This Nelson guy looks
so cute in a vest.

366
00:16:03,827 --> 00:16:05,227
Cutie alert!

367
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,440
Ouch. That Sunflower kid
is stabbing him.

368
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:11,511
Stabbing's for jerks.

369
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:13,349
The Springfield gang
is getting wiped out.

370
00:16:13,445 --> 00:16:16,415
Astrid, why are candy canes
only for Christmas?

371
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,859
Great question.

372
00:16:17,955 --> 00:16:19,685
Subscribers, post your theories.

373
00:16:19,826 --> 00:16:21,556
No racist stuff, you guys.

374
00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:23,433
BOTH: Bye!

375
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:28,739
HOMER: We did it.
We made our house in <i>Boblox.</i>

376
00:16:29,745 --> 00:16:32,745
Aw, I wish Lisa were here, too.

377
00:16:32,852 --> 00:16:34,962
Guys, you've been
in this game so long

378
00:16:34,956 --> 00:16:36,286
that, out in the real world,

379
00:16:36,391 --> 00:16:38,661
the lawn is overgrown,
Bart bought a Lexus,

380
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:41,573
and I had to go to my own
parent-teacher conference.

381
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:45,409
Turns out I'm a joy to have in
class and I might need glasses.

382
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:48,619
Guess what, honey.
Maggie talks in here.

383
00:16:49,484 --> 00:16:53,634
Whoa, Maggie, you're
communicating using only emojis,

384
00:16:53,627 --> 00:16:56,197
like an old person trying
to act like a teenager.

385
00:16:56,198 --> 00:16:59,608
Ha! And, Dad,
you're not at Moe's?

386
00:16:59,705 --> 00:17:01,135
Why would I be at Moe's

387
00:17:01,141 --> 00:17:03,251
when we can play volleyball
with my head?

388
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:04,345
(grunts)

389
00:17:05,116 --> 00:17:07,416
- Whee!
- (laughter)

390
00:17:07,555 --> 00:17:10,655
Who would have thought that
our family would be happiest

391
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:12,461
inside a video game?

392
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:15,195
HOMER:
It's heaven, and it's all
from the comfort

393
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:18,313

Good God. What about
our revenue stream?

400
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,830
They've taken it all.

401
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:51,137
Hmm. I'm gonna show these kids

402
00:17:51,141 --> 00:17:54,081
something
they have no idea exists:

403
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,450
the real world!

405
00:17:58,823 --> 00:18:00,233
Ah, stupid Skinner.

406
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,929
I'm done trying to make money
out of nothing.

407
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,930
I'm going all in on NFTs.

408
00:18:04,034 --> 00:18:05,774
(phone chimes)

409
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:10,814
(groans)

410
00:18:10,914 --> 00:18:13,524
(gasps) Apathetic face emoji?

411
00:18:17,795 --> 00:18:20,365
Arts school!

412
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,206
He's destroyed
the community wasabi garden.

413
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:25,175
He's heading
for the computer lab.

414
00:18:25,176 --> 00:18:27,576
What kind of nurturing is this?

415
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:30,985
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

416
00:18:30,988 --> 00:18:33,288
Out of my way.

417
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:35,102
Don't do this, Seymour.

418
00:18:35,196 --> 00:18:36,526
Oh, I'm doing it.

419
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:39,673
If I crush their computer lab,
we beat these psychos.

420
00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:42,852
Look at yourself. You're
about to bulldoze a school.

421
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:45,615
They took Daddy's money...

422
00:18:45,717 --> 00:18:47,717
(engine revving)

423
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:49,361
...and I'm the daddy!

424
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:52,727
What's happening? We're in
unchartered school territory.

425
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,431
(clucks)

426
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,274
I've spent
the best years of your life

427
00:18:56,271 --> 00:18:58,281
trying to drive you insane,

428
00:18:58,275 --> 00:19:00,105
and now I don't want that.

429
00:19:00,112 --> 00:19:02,282
This isn't you.
You're not a psycho.

430
00:19:02,283 --> 00:19:05,263
You're lame,
like unfrosted cornflakes.

431
00:19:05,356 --> 00:19:07,386
But I want to be Lucky Charms.

432
00:19:07,393 --> 00:19:10,573
It's okay. Corn Flakes
is a surprisingly good cereal.

433
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:13,167
But crushing
this kombucha academy,

434
00:19:13,272 --> 00:19:15,142
that'll ruin your life.

435
00:19:15,242 --> 00:19:17,582
And being partners with you
has made me realize

436
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:19,921
you're... a human being.

437
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,149
No, I'm not.

438
00:19:21,254 --> 00:19:23,634
You are. Walk away.

439
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:26,366
But I already rented
the costumes for <i>Seussical.</i>

440
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,003
It was never meant to be.

441
00:19:29,104 --> 00:19:31,174
But... Josh Gad.

442
00:19:31,274 --> 00:19:32,854
Josh Gad is not real.

443
00:19:32,845 --> 00:19:34,445
He never was.

444
00:19:34,447 --> 00:19:37,647
(sighs)
Right, of course he's not.

445
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:42,427
(backup alarm beeping)

446
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,740
Maybe there's
a teachable moment here.

447
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:48,775
In a sense, the bulldozer
is Anglo-Saxon privilege.

448
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,280
You're fired, Sandra.

449
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:52,319
Oh, thank you!

450
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:54,757
Come on, let's head
to Krusty Burger.

451
00:19:54,755 --> 00:19:56,255
I'll buy you a shake

452
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:58,198
and you can tell me about
your other stupid dreams

453
00:19:58,295 --> 00:19:59,595
that will never happen.

454
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:02,498
No, Bart, I'm done
living in a fantasy world,

455
00:20:02,604 --> 00:20:06,184
<i>because a fantasy world
is no place to live.</i>

456
00:20:06,311 --> 00:20:08,181
Sorry to bother you,
neighborinos, but, uh,

457
00:20:08,315 --> 00:20:10,715
the newspapers have been
stacking up on your porch.

458
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:13,791
I just thought I'd peek in
and give you a lookie-loo.

459
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:17,526
Hello?

460
00:20:22,076 --> 00:20:23,806
Mm...

461
