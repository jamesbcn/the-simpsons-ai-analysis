-Here's a knife.
-Oh, thank you.

So just ask him,
and he'll say no.

252
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,376
Then it'll be his fault.

253
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,058
I don't wanna go. So if he asks
me to go, I'll just say yes.

King me.

337
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,606
(growls)
Still no help.

338
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,818
You know,
it is cougar season,

339
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,689
and those things
don't mess around.

340
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,436
(worried murmur)

341
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,199
A rescue plane!
Get the flare gun!

342
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,043
(grunts) This ain't
one of your church picnic

343
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,869
flare gun firings, Flanders.

344
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,294
This is the real thing.

345
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,302
D'oh! All right.
Well, that's okay.

346
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,048
When they come to rescue him,
they'll rescue us.

347
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,509
D'oh!

348
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,637
Here's our chance.

349
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,435
Dolphins always help
humans lost at sea.

350
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,020
{\an8}(dolphins vocalizing)

351
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,741
Come back!
Come back!

352
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,239
(gasps)
Oh, we're done for.

353
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,871
We're done for.
We're done-didilly done for!

354
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,659
We're done-didilly-dodilly

355
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,662
done-didilly-dodilly
done-didilly-dodilly done--

356
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,865
Flanders!
Snap out of it!

357
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,956
Thank you, Homer.
I don't know what got--

358
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,421
-(Ned grunting)
-Dad! I think he's okay.

359
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,172
-(grunting)
-It's better...

360
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,715
-to be safe than sorry.
-Dodilly--

361
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,340
-Sorry.
-Didilly--

362
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,756
-You see anything yet?
-Nothin', Captain.

363
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,176
Somebody took all the beer
and cold cuts.

364
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,305
That's it. I'm not even castin' off
until we go to the store.

365
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,727
You know, Homer,
this cheese doodle

366
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,145
is our last morsel of food.

367
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:17,494
You'll thank me when we're
fryin' up a big, juicy fish.

368
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:21,333
{\an8}-(strained grunt)
-Godspeed, little doodle.

369
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,155
He'll be back.

370
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,882
Here, fishy, fishy, fishy.

371
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,130
We're waiting.

372
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:39,177
Son, there's something I was gonna
give you at the end of this trip,

373
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,601
but, since we
may not survive,

374
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,601
I want you to have it now.

375
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,563
(gasps)
A real Swiss Army knife. Cool!

376
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,355
I stole it
from that Borgnine guy.

377
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,650
(roaring)

378
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,654
Don't worry, kids. I'll take care
of him with my trusty--

379
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,115
Uh, uh--

380
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:04,949
Um, uh-- Hmm.

381
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,077
Dad, I know I've been
a little hard on you

382
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,174
the last couple of days.

383
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:13,049
If I had the strength to lift my arms,
I'd give you a hug.

384
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,048
Thanks, boy.

385
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,420
Now, be careful
when you-- Oops.

386
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,217
(all gasping)

387
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,012
(relieved sighs)

388
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,603
(sizzling)

389
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,682
Dad, don't take this wrong,

390
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,228
but your expression doesn't
fill me with confidence.

391
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,982
The foul stench of death
is upon us!

392
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,975
(sniffing)
Mmm! Hamburger.

393
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,198
(sniffs) Hey, wait!
I smell hamburgers, too.

394
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,159
(sniffing)

395
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,160
According to this map,

396
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,292
there's a Krusty Burger
on an off-shore oil rig.

397
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,620
That's what you're
smelling, Homer.

398
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:51,495
Oh, if it weren't for this
blasted fog, we'd be saved.

399
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,173
Never mind the fog!
(sniffing) That way!

400
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,463
Steer.
There isn't much time!

401
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,836
(sniffing)

402
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,094
(sign buzzing)

403
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,216
Oh! We're takin' a bath
on this.

404
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:07,474
We tried to tell ya
these are unmanned oil rigs.

405
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,387
Aw, close the damn thing down.
No one's ever gonna come.

406
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,515
-Huh?
-Give me 700 Krusty Burgers!

407
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,897
You want fries with that?

408
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,445
-(gulping)
-You did it, Dad! You saved us!

409
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,319
I'm proud you're my father.

410
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,276
Go away. Eating.

411
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,542
BORGNINE:
Well, it sure is lucky...

412
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,909
we stumbled upon this old,
abandoned summer camp.

413
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,918
CAMPERS:
Yeah.

414
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,420
-Hey, how about a song?
-CAMPERS: Okay. Yeah.
