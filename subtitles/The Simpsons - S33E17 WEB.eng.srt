1
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:19,405
You know, you play pretty well

2
00:00:19,472 --> 00:00:21,442
for someone
with no real problems.

3
00:00:21,544 --> 00:00:24,917
That's 'cause I had
the best teacher.

4
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,756
If you love sports

5
00:00:27,856 --> 00:00:29,993
and house flipping shows,
telenovelas mexicanas

6
00:00:30,027 --> 00:00:32,031
and Holocaust documentaries,

7
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:33,133
get Everything+.

8
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,903
We'll stream anything,

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,574
even shows
that Peacock rejected.

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,652
We've got vintage cartoons

11
00:00:37,676 --> 00:00:39,680
with the racism
and violence edited out,

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,049
so they're four seconds long.

13
00:00:43,186 --> 00:00:46,927
Gurr, why, look,
it's Mr. Crow Jangles.

14
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:59,252
Hey, that's a Bleeding Gums Murphy song.

15
00:00:59,318 --> 00:01:01,322
But they changed the lyrics.

16
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:03,861
He never would've sung
this garbage.

17
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:12,044
This is sacrilegious.
Listen to the original.

18
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:44,008
I can't believe
they're using a jazz legend

19
00:01:44,108 --> 00:01:46,212
to sell lottery tickets.

20
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:47,782
Why do you hate the lottery?

21
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:49,352
It's my retirement plan.

22
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:51,557
The lottery is a tax on people

23
00:01:51,657 --> 00:01:54,261
who can't calculate
the insanely low odds of winning

24
00:01:54,362 --> 00:01:56,299
because they went to schools
that are underfunded

25
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,606
because of... guess what...
Scams like the lottery.

26
00:01:59,673 --> 00:02:02,144
And they trick poor dopes

27
00:02:02,244 --> 00:02:04,616
into buying tickets
they can't afford.

28
00:02:10,528 --> 00:02:12,498
Bleeding Gums
would've been furious.

29
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,235
He hated gambling.

30
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:16,139
Really? How do you know?

31
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,143
Because I'm Bleeding Gums's
biggest expert.

32
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:19,780
I edit his web page.

33
00:02:19,846 --> 00:02:22,318
All right, all right,
working on that title.

34
00:02:22,384 --> 00:02:26,292
And I made a bust
of his embouchure.

35
00:02:27,494 --> 00:02:29,131
So that's what an embouchure is.

36
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:30,935
I learned something today.

37
00:02:31,002 --> 00:02:33,373
And now to forget it.

38
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,743
Gone.

39
00:02:48,738 --> 00:02:50,975
Oh, lighten up, Lisa.

40
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:54,081
As Jesus said,
"You've got to play to win."

41
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:55,518
He didn't say that.

42
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:58,323
After he turned water into wine,
he said a lot of stuff

43
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,661
that he didn't remember
in the morning.

44
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:05,303
Hey, Sticks, Soaky,
Count Four Count,

45
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:07,041
Hi Hat Pat, The Three Bottoms,

46
00:03:07,107 --> 00:03:10,213
Salty Joe and the Irregular Heartbeats...

47
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,788
...No Nickname Henderson,
Daly Night, Nighty Day,

48
00:03:13,888 --> 00:03:16,225
and the Backup Boys.

49
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:22,739
I am sure
you're all as upset as me.

50
00:03:22,806 --> 00:03:24,141
Hell yeah!

51
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:26,613
- About what?
- About Bleeding Gums's music

52
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,051
being misappropriated
by the lottery.

53
00:03:29,151 --> 00:03:30,755
It happens all the time.

54
00:03:30,822 --> 00:03:35,263
America's only original art form
is stealing Black music.

55
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,736
Well, there's only one way
to stop them:

56
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:40,073
Boycott the lottery.

57
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:42,277
Shh. They're announcing
the lotto numbers.

58
00:03:44,248 --> 00:03:46,018
Six, 27,

59
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:48,223
32, 14...

60
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:50,995
Oh, man. Come on.

61
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:53,366
Let me tell you something,
people. One more number,

62
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,936
and I'm a winner.

63
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:57,274
If it happens, that's the last
you'll see of me.

64
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:59,011
I despise this town,

65
00:03:59,078 --> 00:04:00,948
especially
the death-stalking ghouls

66
00:04:00,982 --> 00:04:01,984
who watch local news.

67
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,453
And the last number is...

68
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:05,925
62. I lost.

69
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:10,300
In other news, Kent Brockman's
"Hooray for Springfield!"

70
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:11,503
Airs tomorrow at 8:00.

71
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,741
Oh, I love this town.

72
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:15,678
Just once,
I want to be one of those guys

73
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:18,249
who wins the lottery
and blows it on a single binge

74
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:19,953
that haunts him to his grave.

75
00:04:21,222 --> 00:04:23,193
Aw, what's wrong?

76
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:25,798
A jazz god's work
has been misappropriated.

77
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,301
But I'm gonna fix it.

78
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,804
Come here, kid.
This is important.

79
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:32,612
Lisa, if you ever listen
to one thing I say, it's this:

80
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:35,383
Don't try to save anyone
or anything.

81
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,089
Please, please,
do not waste your time

82
00:04:38,123 --> 00:04:39,325
chasing lost causes.

83
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:41,028
The environment? It's over.

84
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:42,999
Democracy? Hanging by a thread.

85
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:46,573
Broadcast television?
Only losers still watch that.

86
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:51,817
So promise me
you won't waste time

87
00:04:51,884 --> 00:04:53,687
on this jazz dealy.

88
00:04:53,754 --> 00:04:54,856
You have my word.

89
00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:58,263
I won't waste any more time
on lost causes.

90
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:02,505
Because time spent
on lost causes is never wasted.

91
00:05:02,572 --> 00:05:03,707
What did you just mutter?

92
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:05,778
Something that undercut
what I said.

93
00:05:05,845 --> 00:05:07,816
That's my girl.

94
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,361
The Springfield Lottery
has been accused

95
00:05:09,385 --> 00:05:11,957
of misappropriating
a revered musician's work.

96
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:13,928
Tonight, because...

97
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:16,165
...this crap station
is still stuck with me,

98
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:19,238
I'm hosting a debate between the
state lottery and Lisa Simpson,

99
00:05:19,305 --> 00:05:20,975
who has anointed herself

100
00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:24,883
the world's foremost
Bleeding Gums Murphy expert.

101
00:05:26,018 --> 00:05:27,956
I'm still working on that name.

102
00:05:28,022 --> 00:05:29,191
But I can tell you

103
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,864
he would not want
his incredible music

104
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:35,872
used for this carnival of greed
known as the lottery.

105
00:05:35,938 --> 00:05:40,413
- Little girl, you claim to know everything about Mr. Murphy.
- I do.

106
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,621
- Do you even know his first name?
- Oscar.

107
00:05:43,687 --> 00:05:46,693
- Do you know his favorite key?
- B-flat.

108
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:49,699
Mm, that's right.
Favorite brand of reed?

109
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,768
Légère.

110
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:52,271
Favorite type of jazz?

111
00:05:52,304 --> 00:05:53,674
- Straight-ahead.
- Huh.

112
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:55,711
Do you know the name
of his first recording?

113
00:05:55,778 --> 00:05:59,318
Well, his first album
was Broken Elevator Blues.

114
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:02,424
- Yes...
- But his first recording

115
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:04,094
was at Minton's Playhouse

116
00:06:04,194 --> 00:06:06,399
playing
alongside Thelonious Monk

117
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,938
when Bleeding Gums was 16.

118
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:10,207
Hmm, right again.

119
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,346
She'll know this.
She'll know this.

120
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:16,285
Aha. How old is his son?

121
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:17,354
He has a son?

122
00:06:18,924 --> 00:06:20,528
I did not know that.

123
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:22,497
No further questions,
Your Honor.

124
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:24,669
But this isn't a courtroom.

125
00:06:24,703 --> 00:06:26,405
Overruled.

126
00:06:26,472 --> 00:06:28,611
We'll be right back.

127
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:35,390
I feel like a fool.

128
00:06:35,457 --> 00:06:36,893
How could I love someone so much

129
00:06:36,994 --> 00:06:39,833
and not know something
so important about him?

130
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,402
Don't worry, Lisa.

131
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:44,308
- To me, you're perfect.
- I am?

132
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:47,047
Yes. But I'm just an image
created by your mind,

133
00:06:47,147 --> 00:06:49,018
so I say what you want.

134
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:50,821
Oh, that's pleasant.

135
00:06:50,922 --> 00:06:53,527
Come on, Lis.
Let's play Target Lisa.

136
00:06:53,594 --> 00:06:55,631
Sorry, I'm too sad.

137
00:06:55,698 --> 00:06:58,637
I can barely play
the soulless sounds of Kenny G.

138
00:06:58,704 --> 00:07:00,340
No one likes Kenny G.

139
00:07:00,407 --> 00:07:02,845
That's why they killed
Kenny A through F.

140
00:07:02,912 --> 00:07:05,718
I didn't even know
my hero had a son.

141
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:09,058
Watching you cry
makes me feel the need to act.

142
00:07:11,462 --> 00:07:14,001
Ah, much better.

143
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,871
I'm gonna find your son.

144
00:07:15,972 --> 00:07:17,542
And I'm gonna find out
what he thinks

145
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:19,879
about the way
your songs are being used.

146
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,188
Well, here's a clue. I named him
after my favorite piano player.

147
00:07:24,254 --> 00:07:26,860
Monk. M-Monk Murphy.

148
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,762
That's right.

149
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:29,231
Now that you've got the name,

150
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:30,433
just check the phone book.

151
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:32,170
What's a phone book?

152
00:07:32,237 --> 00:07:34,909
I have been dead a long time.

153
00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:39,151
Hi. I'm Lisa Simpson.

154
00:07:39,218 --> 00:07:40,688
And you're Monk Murphy.

155
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:43,126
Oh, my God.
You look just like your father.

156
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:44,161
Let me guess.

157
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:46,667
You're one of the musicians
my dad mentored.

158
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:49,271
Do you want to come in
and see pictures of him?

159
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:51,011
Well, I don't want to impose
on your time.

160
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:53,781
- Okay.
- Oh, yes! Please, please, please.

161
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:56,553
Let me just tell you,
I loved your dad.

162
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,193
For a blues musician,
he could really cheer people up.

163
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:03,499
Just thinking about him
makes me smile.

164
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,873
And I found out
he recorded a song just for you.

165
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,744
"Monk's New Tune."

166
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:19,699
Please, I'm sorry.

167
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,570
That's not something
I can enjoy.

168
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:23,574
I understand. You miss your dad.

169
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,245
I do. But I can't enjoy music

170
00:08:26,312 --> 00:08:28,483
because I can't hear it.
Never could.

171
00:08:28,517 --> 00:08:30,521
I was born profoundly deaf.

172
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:32,658
Oh. But this whole time
we were talking,

173
00:08:32,725 --> 00:08:35,397
- you seemed to hear everything.
- I read lips.

174
00:08:35,463 --> 00:08:36,533
Then read this:

175
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:37,969
I'm your dad's biggest fan.

176
00:08:38,036 --> 00:08:40,708
Did you love him
as much as I do?

177
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:42,444
Yes. He was a great dad.

178
00:08:42,545 --> 00:08:45,250
He even refereed
my soccer games.

179
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,895
You know,

180
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:53,199
his whole world
was music and me.

181
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,003
So he took it kind of hard

182
00:08:55,103 --> 00:08:57,842
when he found out
that I couldn't hear.

183
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:23,126
This boy's hearing loss
is so profound,

184
00:09:23,226 --> 00:09:25,664
you could fire a gun
right next to his head,

185
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:26,900
and he wouldn't hear it.

186
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,537
That's not how you tested him,
is it?

187
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:30,173
Of course not.

188
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,112
There have been
great advancements, though.

189
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:34,481
With a cochlear implant

190
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:36,520
combined with auditory
and language therapy,

191
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,423
he could potentially
hear quite well.

192
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:41,596
But I have to warn you, like
any important medical miracle,

193
00:09:41,663 --> 00:09:42,932
it's only for rich people

194
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,504
and doctors
who get a huge discount.

195
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:49,946
Son,
I'm gonna work night and day

196
00:09:50,046 --> 00:09:51,883
to get you
that cochlear implant.

197
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:55,490
Uh, do you have any other skills
besides playing jazz?

198
00:09:55,558 --> 00:09:57,762
I also teach jazz.

199
00:09:57,895 --> 00:10:00,500
Uh, how are you paying
for this appointment?

200
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,137
With this.

201
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:06,680
Looks like about $16.

202
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,552
Yeah. I had a good month.

203
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:11,723
Wow. That must be
when your father wrote.

204
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,994
"Sixteen Bucks
Just Ain't Enough."

205
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:16,533
Do you still want to get
the cochlear implant?

206
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:18,402
I do. Very much.

207
00:10:18,537 --> 00:10:20,306
But I take after my dad.

208
00:10:20,373 --> 00:10:23,847
He played jazz for a living.
I run a nonprofit.

209
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:27,220
I make a lot more than he did
but not enough.

210
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,293
Wait. Did you know
they're using your dad's song

211
00:10:30,393 --> 00:10:31,930
for the Springfield Lottery?

212
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,502
Oh, my God. What?
But he hated gambling.

213
00:10:34,536 --> 00:10:36,640
I know. Did he tell you that?

214
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,344
Uh, no.
I learned it on the website,

215
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:41,081
Bleeding Gummy Bears.

216
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,656
Yes! Finally nailed the title.

217
00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:46,893
But the lottery
must be giving you money.

218
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,031
Enough for the implant. Right?

219
00:10:49,064 --> 00:10:51,770
Nope. I'm afraid
I haven't gotten any money.

220
00:10:51,837 --> 00:10:54,742
I'm sorry, what?
I was destined to find you.

221
00:10:54,843 --> 00:10:57,314
My new mission in life
is to make you happy.

222
00:10:57,414 --> 00:10:58,884
You're my new cause.

223
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,855
Hold up.
I'm not anybody's cause.

224
00:11:00,955 --> 00:11:03,961
I enjoy who I am.
I love my community.

225
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:07,568
And, you know, sometimes I like
turning off annoying sounds

226
00:11:07,635 --> 00:11:09,171
by just closing my eyes.

227
00:11:09,304 --> 00:11:11,175
Oh, yes. I hate annoying noises.

228
00:11:11,242 --> 00:11:13,981
Now just listen.
Here's what we're gonna do.

229
00:11:14,081 --> 00:11:17,688
We're gonna bring
those publishers to their knees.

230
00:11:17,755 --> 00:11:18,991
You and I are g...

231
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:22,063
...gonna lawyer up, and I...

232
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,272
Then, eventually,
the Supreme Court will hear...

233
00:11:27,842 --> 00:11:29,913
...going to restore
your dad's legacy.

234
00:11:30,013 --> 00:11:32,852
Now? I have to eat.
I have a blood sugar thing.

235
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:36,726
It's so much easier if you
don't work against me here.

236
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:39,666
It's cool. They know me here.

237
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:42,204
Mind if I open this window?

238
00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:44,709
This place has windows?

239
00:11:44,776 --> 00:11:46,846
I'm home.

240
00:11:46,913 --> 00:11:49,852
Ooh, they put up
a memorial wall.

241
00:11:49,953 --> 00:11:52,224
That's McCoy Tyner.
He played with Coltrane.

242
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,129
Gerald Wilson,
the west coast Duke Ellington.

243
00:11:55,196 --> 00:11:57,902
And look, Sarah Vaughan.

244
00:11:58,035 --> 00:12:00,674
Oh, no. Etta Pryor passed?

245
00:12:00,741 --> 00:12:02,310
No, baby, I didn't.

246
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,651
I am not gonna lean
against this wall anymore.

247
00:12:05,751 --> 00:12:08,489
Now scat.
No, no, no. Baby, please.

248
00:12:08,557 --> 00:12:10,393
Not that kind of scatting.

249
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:16,773
We just wanted some information
about my dad.

250
00:12:16,873 --> 00:12:18,442
Monk Murphy?

251
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:21,850
Your dad used to bring you here
when you was just a baby.

252
00:12:21,883 --> 00:12:24,321
You know,
I wrote so many songs about you.

253
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:27,093
Like, uh, um, um, "Please Change
the Baby's Diaper."

254
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:29,498
"That Baby Spit Up
on My Good Dress."

255
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:31,503
And "Who Brings a Baby
to a Jazz Club?"

256
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:32,838
Now, that was a smash hit.

257
00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:34,909
Oh, it's so good
to see you again.

258
00:12:34,976 --> 00:12:37,480
No one
knew your dad better than me.

259
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,619
I knew him better than his mama,

260
00:12:39,686 --> 00:12:42,223
his preacher and his supplier

261
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,094
at the Sunglass Hut.

262
00:12:44,161 --> 00:12:46,031
Great. Who owns the rights
to his music?

263
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,804
I don't know.
But I do know this.

264
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,610
Let me tell you
about Bleeding Gums.

265
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,222
Oh, look,
don't you listen to him,

266
00:12:58,322 --> 00:13:01,362
'cause nobody
knew Bleeding Gums like me.

267
00:13:30,386 --> 00:13:32,257
Oh, what's that?

268
00:13:32,357 --> 00:13:35,296
"Treasured Artist Records."
His publisher.

269
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,500
That's where we go.

270
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:49,592
Now we'll find out
who's selling your dad's music.

271
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:51,696
"Check Is in the Mail Publishing."

272
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:53,567
"Fair Shake Records,
a Subsidiary

273
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,537
of Exploitainment Partners."

274
00:13:55,604 --> 00:13:58,744
"Rhythm and Soul Records,
Harvey Whitebread, Owner."

275
00:13:58,844 --> 00:14:01,649
Ugh. Oh! Here we are.

276
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,358
Look, before I can even talk
to you, sign this. Please.

277
00:14:07,895 --> 00:14:09,464
Why'd you do that?

278
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:11,268
All I got was "please."

279
00:14:11,335 --> 00:14:14,174
That mustache
makes his lips hard to read.

280
00:14:14,274 --> 00:14:16,478
Ah, thanks. I work hard
on not having readable lips.

281
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:18,416
Or handwriting. Or fingerprints.

282
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,821
Yeah.

283
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:22,925
How could you sell
Bleeding Gums's song

284
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:26,198
to the lottery? It belongs
to him and his family.

285
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,670
No, you're right.
Uh, Bleeding Gums wrote it.

286
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,115
Then he came to us
to distribute it.

287
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:32,310
He should've read
the contract boilerplate,

288
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,323
which we never showed him
nor told him actually existed.

289
00:14:34,347 --> 00:14:36,986
And, boy,
is there a lot of boilerplate.

290
00:14:37,053 --> 00:14:39,659
But, uh, he got his share.

291
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:43,099
"Worldwide royalties, 92 cents"?

292
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,771
This is half
of what they promised.

293
00:14:45,838 --> 00:14:48,008
This is the 21st century, bub,

294
00:14:48,075 --> 00:14:49,912
where artists own their work.

295
00:14:49,979 --> 00:14:51,819
Although they often have
to release it for free

296
00:14:51,883 --> 00:14:55,256
on the Internet.
But we are gonna sue you.

297
00:14:55,323 --> 00:14:56,826
We don't own the rights anymore.

298
00:14:56,893 --> 00:14:58,964
We sold them
to a powerful consortium

299
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,968
including Nike,
Lay's potato chips,

300
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,905
Turkish oligarchs and Evil Corp.

301
00:15:02,972 --> 00:15:05,611
His hologram's been on tour
in Europe.

302
00:15:19,572 --> 00:15:21,208
Well, you tell your consortium

303
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:23,814
that there's
46 pounds of trouble

304
00:15:23,914 --> 00:15:25,349
standing right here.

305
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,688
It could take years and years
to beat them,

306
00:15:27,788 --> 00:15:29,057
but you're into that, right?

307
00:15:29,124 --> 00:15:31,696
- Not really.
- What?

308
00:15:31,796 --> 00:15:33,800
I'm happy. Let me rephrase that.

309
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,369
I was happy

310
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:38,142
until a little girl came
and told me I wasn't.

311
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:41,749
Please, stop helping me.

312
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,287
No, no, no, no, no.
Give me one more chance.

313
00:15:44,354 --> 00:15:46,358
Read my lips.

314
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:48,162
Nope.

315
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:53,038
I guess you were right, Dad.

316
00:15:53,105 --> 00:15:54,509
I'm ready to quit.

317
00:15:54,609 --> 00:15:56,846
I'm proud of you, sweetie.

318
00:15:56,946 --> 00:15:58,282
I've never even tried.

319
00:15:58,382 --> 00:16:00,086
I'm very proud of you, boy.

320
00:16:00,186 --> 00:16:01,823
I'm going to my room.

321
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,927
Nothing beats
a lonely, dark room

322
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:05,597
after a giant mistake.

323
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,868
Love you.

324
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,208
Mm. I think something's wrong
with Lisa.

325
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:13,212
Something was wrong with Lisa.

326
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,218
Good news, Marge.
I got it all handled.

327
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:17,721
Oh, boy.

328
00:16:17,855 --> 00:16:19,625
Maybe I should talk to her.

329
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:22,263
She just told me she agreed
with everything I said.

330
00:16:22,363 --> 00:16:24,401
If you interfere,
it'll ruin all my hard work

331
00:16:24,535 --> 00:16:26,606
and send this home
into a tailspin

332
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:28,710
that it may never recover from.

333
00:16:28,777 --> 00:16:30,948
Are you sure she's okay?

334
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,595
She's in her happy place,
sad music.

335
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:38,897
All right, then.

336
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:40,534
Good night, sweetie.

337
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,507
Uh, sweetie?
Could you close your eyes?

338
00:16:43,607 --> 00:16:45,376
They're really bright.

339
00:16:51,054 --> 00:16:53,058
This is so sad.

340
00:16:53,158 --> 00:16:54,862
What's on the B side?

341
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:02,243
I'm taking a walk.

342
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,251
I just wish you were here.

343
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,523
You always knew what to say.

344
00:17:10,026 --> 00:17:11,228
Little Lisa,

345
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:14,067
I'm always magically here
for you,

346
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,739
like Will Smith
in The Legend of Bagger Vance

347
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,114
or, better yet, Morgan Freeman
in Driving Miss Daisy.

348
00:17:26,726 --> 00:17:30,166
- May I drive you.
- To the Kwik... E-Mart, Miss Lisa?

349
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:31,168
Yes, Hoke.

350
00:17:31,235 --> 00:17:34,307
And teach me about equality
and civil rights

351
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:37,013
in a way that doesn't
make me feel too guilty.

352
00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:38,984
In return, in 30 years,

353
00:17:39,084 --> 00:17:42,123
I will ask you your last name.

354
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,263
Hey, whoa. What are you doing?

355
00:17:45,363 --> 00:17:47,534
I was forming
an unlikely friendship.

356
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:50,206
Hey, me, too.
Against how many odds?

357
00:17:50,273 --> 00:17:51,676
All.

358
00:17:51,776 --> 00:17:53,813
But I see you
as so much more than that.

359
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,617
It's your legacy
I'm fighting for.

360
00:17:55,684 --> 00:17:59,357
And evil corporations can't win
against someone like me

361
00:17:59,424 --> 00:18:01,896
who has a big heart,
gumption and...

362
00:18:01,963 --> 00:18:03,566
Oh, crap.

363
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:06,104
I'm just a kid,
this is real life,

364
00:18:06,204 --> 00:18:08,510
and there's only so much
I can do.

365
00:18:08,576 --> 00:18:11,114
All right.
I surrender to reality.

366
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:12,618
Little Lisa,

367
00:18:12,685 --> 00:18:14,822
you're finally starting
to understand

368
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:17,026
what the blues is all about.

369
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:23,673
Is this where Monk Murphy works?

370
00:18:23,773 --> 00:18:26,244
Yes. He's directing a production
of Richard III.

371
00:18:26,345 --> 00:18:29,117
I believe it's the first time
an eight-year-old deaf girl

372
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,821
has played that role.

373
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:33,125
Wow. I am so there.

374
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:36,031
Now is the winter
of our discontent

375
00:18:36,131 --> 00:18:39,639
made glorious summer
by this son of York.

376
00:18:39,705 --> 00:18:43,178
Son of York!

377
00:18:43,312 --> 00:18:45,651
Son
of York!

378
00:18:48,055 --> 00:18:50,627
A mentor. Just like your dad.

379
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:52,631
Uh, I came to apologize.

380
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:55,604
Hey, you really don't need
to apologize to me.

381
00:18:55,704 --> 00:18:57,373
Oh, really?
But I worked so hard on it.

382
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,177
Four drafts. Single-spaced.

383
00:18:59,244 --> 00:19:00,413
It's really good.

384
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,751
How about you
just give me the gist?

385
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:06,158
Sure. You'll love the gist.
It's such a great gist.

386
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:08,162
Okay, here we go.

387
00:19:08,228 --> 00:19:11,068
"Your dad saved me once
when I was really sad.

388
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:12,705
"So when I found out
you existed,

389
00:19:12,805 --> 00:19:13,907
"even before I met you,

390
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,113
"I thought saving you somehow
was what I was meant to do.

391
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,284
"Now I know
the right thing to do

392
00:19:19,384 --> 00:19:21,288
"would have been
to just listen to you

393
00:19:21,388 --> 00:19:24,628
when you said you didn't need
or want saving."

394
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:27,935
Awesome. And guess what?
I'm getting the implant.

395
00:19:28,002 --> 00:19:29,270
That's wonderful.

396
00:19:29,337 --> 00:19:31,208
How did you get the money?

397
00:19:31,274 --> 00:19:33,345
I finished ninth in the lottery.

398
00:19:33,412 --> 00:19:36,919
"Get in it to win it,
it just takes a minute."

399
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:39,090
Ugh. Forget I asked.

400
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:41,662
Okay, I'm about to activate
the device.

401
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,600
This is gonna be so great.

402
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,704
I've picked
something very special

403
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:49,411
for the first sounds
you'll ever hear.

404
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,091
Screw you, Bart!

405
00:19:56,191 --> 00:19:58,262
"Screw you, Bart"? I heard that.

406
00:19:58,362 --> 00:20:00,466
Wow. Beautiful.

407
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:04,207
Woo-hoo! A forgotten prank
made me the center of attention.

408
00:20:04,307 --> 00:20:07,013
Oh, no, no, that's not it.

409
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,019
This is what I wanted you
to hear.

410
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,570
Oh, my God.

411
00:20:35,637 --> 00:20:37,875
I can hear his voice
for the first time.

412
00:20:37,941 --> 00:20:39,010
Thank you, Lisa.

413
00:20:39,077 --> 00:20:41,481
This is totally going
on the website.

414
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:45,957
Oh, you made an old jazz man
happy, little Lisa.

415
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:49,497
Also, uh... what's a website?

421

Much better.
