{\an8}Well, Homer, maybe you
can take some consolation

188

you created

352
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,914
D'oh!

353
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,292
Hmm, lawyers,
lawyers, lawyers...

354
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,336
Ooh, Lionel Hutz!

355
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,920
"Cases won in 30 minutes
or your pizza's free."

356
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,638
I'd sell my soul
for a Formula 1 racing car.

357
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,060
(chuckling)
That can be arranged.

358
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,889
Changed my mind. Sorry.

359
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,265
Cool.

360
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,981
Bart, stop
pestering Satan.

361
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,901
Your Honor, we find
that Homer Simpson's soul

362
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,531
is legally the property
of Marge Simpson

363
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,488
-and not of the devil.
-Oh...

364
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,989
(cheering)

365
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,160
Woo-hoo! Oh!

366
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,659
Well, I didn't win.
Here's your pizza.

367
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,833
But we did win.

368
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,410
That's okay. The box is empty.

369
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,713
If that's what they cut out,

370
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,171
what they leave in
must be pure gold!

371
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,632
Let's watch some more

372
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,052
of those fabulous
Simpsons outtakes.

373
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:33,551
<i>Apu living with the Simpsons?</i>

{\an8}I'm hoping you

376
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,806

{\an8}This movie you rented sucks.

381
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,081
No, it doesn't.
It's funny.

382
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,832
Their clothes are different
from my clothes.

383
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,424
(laughs)

384
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,879

390
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,601
{\an8}Bart, you're coming home.

391
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,392
I want to stay here
with Mr. Burns.

392
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,386
I suggest you leave
immediately.

393
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,938
Or what? You'll release
the dogs or the bees

394
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,112
or the dogs with bees
in their mouth

395
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,571
and when they bark,
they shoot bees at you?

396
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,992
Well, go ahead!

397
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,490
Do your worst!

398
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,121
My worst, eh?

399
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,408
Smithers, release
the robotic Richard Simmons.

400
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,332
Come on, big boy!

401
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,333
Shake the butter
off those buns!

402
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,997

(all screaming)

416
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,945
This past summer,
all of America

417
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:24,543
was trying to solve the mystery
of who shot Mr. Burns.

418
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,751
Then they found out
it was the baby.

419
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,212
(coughs)

420
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,002
To keep this bombshell secret,

421
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,415
the producers animated
several solutions

422
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,724
that were never intended
to air.

423
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:40,013
{\an8}(groaning)

424
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:45,015
(groaning)

425
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,980
And to keep the show's
animators, editors, staff,

426
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,651
and hangers-on
from leaking the solution,

427
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,151
two completely different
endings were produced--

428
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,323
one real, one phony.

429
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,362
Here's the ending
you were never meant to see.

430
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,317
The one who shot me was...

431
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,159
(screaming)

432
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,914
Wayland Smithers.

433
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,996
No!

434
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,001
Wait a minute.

435
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,712
Yes.

436
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,882
With the sun blocker
in place and the town aghast,

437
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,382
I was on top of the world.

438
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,594
So I wanted to kick up
my heels and indulge

439
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,635
my sweet tooth.

440
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,548
I feel like celebrating.

441
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,521
Oh, it's you.

442
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,849
What are you
so happy about?

443
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,104
(Burns gasps)

444
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,095
I see.

445
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,726
Smithers had thwarted

446
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,862
my earlier attempt
to take candy from a baby,

447
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,110
but with him out
of the picture,

448
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,572
I was free to wallow
in my own crapulence...

449
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,453
or so I thought.

450
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,699
At the last moment,

451
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,332
Smithers, drunk as a lemur,
lurched out

452
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,699
of the darkness and fired.

453
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,906
(groaning)

454
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,285
That's right.

455
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,962
Right before I shot Jasper.

456
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,541
Hmm. I was busy that night.

457
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,667
BURNS:
<i>Stricken, I lurched forth</i>

458
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,424
<i>in search of aid.</i>

459
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,216
<i>But, finding only slack-jawed</i>
<i>gawkers,</i>

460
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,469
<i>I gave up and collapsed</i>
<i>on the sundial.</i>

461
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,221
Then, with your
last ounce of strength,

462
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,774
you pointed
to "w" and "S."

463
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,228
Wayland Smithers.

464
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,139
Well, I'm just relieved
that Homer's safe,

465
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,808
and that you've recovered
and we can get back to normal.

466
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,477
Not exactly.

467
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,645
Smithers,
for attempting to kill me,

468
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:22,025
I'm giving you
a five percent pay cut.

469
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,954
Ohh!

470
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,333
But, of course,
for that ending to work,

471
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,501
you would have to ignore
all the Simpson DNA evidence.

472
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,460
(laughing) And that would be
downright nutty.

473
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:38,383
Yes, the Simpsons have come a long way
since an old drunk made humans

474
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,433
out of his rabbit characters
to pay off his gambling debts.

475
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,258
Who knows what adventures
they'll have

476
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:47,393
between now and the time
the show becomes unprofitable?

477
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,732
I'm Troy McClure,
and I'll leave you

478
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,728
