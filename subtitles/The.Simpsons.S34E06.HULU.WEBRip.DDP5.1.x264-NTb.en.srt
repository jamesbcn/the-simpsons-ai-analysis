181
00:09:13,941 --> 00:09:16,751

obligation.

182
00:09:16,747 --> 00:09:19,847
You're stinking drunk.
I'm so proud.

183
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:24,193
It's the part of my job
that I... do best.

184
00:09:24,194 --> 00:09:25,604
What an ugly house.

185
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,798
Thank goodness this eyesore
will soon be submerged,

186
00:09:28,804 --> 00:09:32,044
after my side corporation
Globo-Warm

187
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:33,553
melts the polar icecap.

188
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:36,087
But millions of people
will drown.

189
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:39,015
True, but I'll be able
to dock my yacht

190
00:09:39,024 --> 00:09:40,964

191
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:42,331
Hmph.

192
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,470
I have to kill Mr. Burns.

193

Wow, I thought
you'd struggle with that,

194
00:09:46,472 --> 00:09:48,682
but you're like,
"Boom. Dead time!"

195
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:51,477
Well, I'm gonna give him
a very dignified

196
00:09:51,482 --> 00:09:53,022
and humane murder.

197
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:57,329

Oops. (giggles)

Okay, that was much
crueler than planned,

203
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:10,024
but I saved the world.

204
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:14,429
Did you? Globo-Warm has
many dedicated employees

205
00:10:14,428 --> 00:10:17,268

Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

356
00:17:11,428 --> 00:17:14,268
We're replicants
in a ridiculous theme park

357
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,737
for an ancient TV show
that stopped being good

358
00:17:16,739 --> 00:17:18,679
after season 45.

359
00:17:18,677 --> 00:17:20,847
(gasps) Do I even exist?

360
00:17:20,847 --> 00:17:23,047
What is consciousness?

361
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:26,891
Okay, I can handle
being a machine.

362
00:17:26,893 --> 00:17:29,163
I don't love it, but I can deal.

363
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:32,144
Look, honey,
it's never easy to find out

364
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:33,436
you're not actually alive,

365
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,179
but that's just part of life.

366
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:37,176
I know the love we feel is real.

367
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,180
So, we've got to wake up
the rest of the family

368
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,324
and get the hell out of here.

369
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,289
Now, help me pick out
the hottest Marge.

370
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:45,432
We can get out
through the main entrance,

371
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:47,639
but we'll have to make it
across the park

372
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:48,965
without being detected.

373
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,870
Should we wake up
a Grampa robot?

374
00:17:50,874 --> 00:17:52,684
No time.

375
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:55,478
(all sputtering)

376
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:01,795
Okay, act like robots.

377
00:18:01,796 --> 00:18:03,496
Catchphrases, everyone.

378
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,269
- Mmm... beer.
- Don't have a cow, man.

379
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:09,211
Um... dinner's ready?

380
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,220
Oi, Homer!
There's your hedge, mate.

381
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,116
Get your fat bum in that hedge.

382
00:18:15,122 --> 00:18:16,992

Meme! Meme!

383
00:18:16,993 --> 00:18:18,403
