{\an8}Uh, well, Tim,
just thought you should know,

00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,650
{\an8}a very special fan club
is waiting to talk to you.

23

{\an8}Mm!

00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,913

{\an8}That's right, your boss.

28
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,713
{\an8}And I'd like to introduce you
to my boss, the Patriarch.

29
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:27,052
{\an8}Actually, Parson,
we all have the same boss.

{\an8}The Metropolitan.

31
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:32,432
{\an8}And it is his will
that we come together here for...

32
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,349
{\an8}a divine intervention.

33
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,178
{\an8}Look, since when is it a crime

34
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,473
{\an8}to mix Pinot Noir and Vicodin?

35
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:43,647
{\an8}Oh, we don't care if you wreck your liver
with Sancerre and acetaminophen.

36
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:47,858
{\an8}You can pop pain pills

00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,878
to, uh, non-religious areas.

46
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,644
Timothy, admit it. You're in a slump.

47
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,469
How many souls have you personally
converted to our faith this year?

48
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,887
Negative six.

49
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,305
You have some converting to do.

And what do you have to say?

53
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,700
Nothing! Just pointing it out.

54
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,948
Okay, I can do this.

00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,410

it's environmentally conscious.

how's your act coming along?

I'm not in show business.

What kind of a screwed-up kid are you?

108
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,542
I'm not screwed up. I get good grades.

109

-I play the French horn.
-Good, good.

110
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,827

it's funny when someone's playing it

Well, don't feel bad.

Tzimmes? Megillah?

117
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,425
It's Yiddish.

118

Dad, you don't have to be
sort of funny with me.

127
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,792
The thing is,
I want to celebrate this time with you.

128
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,794
Sweetie, I know you're reaching out.

129
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,046
But to me, Christmas is just another day.

130
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,669
I usually curl up
with a good bookmaker, and...

131
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,972
Well...

132
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,473
Why don't the two of you
spend Christmas with us?

133
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,016
Our home isn't fancy,

134
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:53,269
but we'd love to set a place
for two more.

135
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,523
Marge, we accept.

136
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,105
-Can we bring anything?
-Just yourself.

137
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,481
That'll cost you.

138
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,612
(singsongy) Oh, Maggie.

139
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,485
Guess who just came down the chimney?

140
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,452
A magical holiday friend,

141
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,162
straight from the North Pole.

142
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,253
He's called the Gnome In Your Home,
and he works for Santa,

143
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,790
by watching you all the time.

144
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,963
According to a book sold separately,

145
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,764
the Gnome In Your Home
doesn't need food or sleep.

146
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,588
He lives for just one thing--

147
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,554
to tell Santa if you're bad or good.

148
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,756
(sucking pacifier rapidly)

149
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:31,845
He's gonna live here on your shelf,
and he never shuts his eyes.

150
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,143
Isn't that cute?

151
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:37,476
You'd better be good,
or he'll nibble your wittle fingers!

00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,327
from the bottom of my heart.

157
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,287
(calling) Did you get the shot?

158
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,337
How did it play? Was I too sincere?

159
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,471

176
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,385
{\an8}dial 1-900-OLD-POEM.

177
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,061
{\an8}$9.95 per call.

178
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,559
{\an8}All I wanted was to spend
the holidays with you

179
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,731
{\an8}so we could learn more about each other.

180
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,600
{\an8}Well, I learned!

181
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:00,937
{\an8}Get out!

182
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,902
{\an8}-(crying)
-What? Seriously?

183
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,443
{\an8}You really want me to go?

184
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,277
{\an8}Yes.

185
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,992
{\an8}Right now.

186
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,575
(doorbell rings)

187
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,080
Uh, can we get some room tone?

188
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,293
Just 20 seconds.

189
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,684
Oh, Sophie! Please, forgive me.

190
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,274
I canceled the show.

191
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,599
I'm pulling up duct tape myself,

192
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,274
like a caveman!

193
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,944
SOPHIE:
(crying) Just leave me alone.

194
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,653
(groaning)

195
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,068
{\an8}If the Word of God isn't enough,

196
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,994
{\an8}I also have some rubber jar openers.

197
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,164
(groans) I've been directing
Christmas pageants for 30 years.

198
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,664
There's no way there's a God.

199
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:02,286
Forget it. Our nonsense is
so much better than your nonsense.

200
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,625
Look at this guy!
He can be a Pixar hero.

201
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,750
Look at him!

202
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:09,916
No, maybe I'm just not cut out
for the God game.

203
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,297
Maybe I could teach S.A.T. Prep.

204
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,845
At least there are answers
in the back of that book.

205

206
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:23,814

do you serve to a guy

207
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,186
whose daughter hates his guts?

208
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,194
Yeah. Try a Duff Numb.
No flavor, just alcohol.

209
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,697
(gulps)

210
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,988
I need something that makes me
feel better in my heart.

211
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,663
Like firing a writer.

212
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,871
Especially one who just bought a house.

213
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,162

215
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,963
My son, I'm here to guide you
to the most powerful man

216
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,501
in this world, or any other.

217
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,336
J.J. Abrams?

218
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,171
No. Jesus.

219
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,506
He is reaching his arms out to you.

220
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,514
Oh, my God. I can see him.

221
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,427
I am a Christian!

222
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,265

00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,185
Uh, Chief, I think you got him.

225
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,822
Yeah, it's Christmas. (chuckles)

226
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,858
Just bang his head on the car door
and we'll call it a day.

227
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,363
Merry Christmas.

228
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,445
Good night, sweet Maggie. Mwah.

229
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:18,199
Why are you huddling over there?
The gnome can't see you.

230

Oh, sorry, I forgot your nightlight.

The gnome can't nibble your fingers

236

I've got a tummy ache.

245
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,667
Maybe I ate too much before bedtime.

246
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,894
Have you been a bad baby?

247
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,770
Oh. Don't lie to me...

248
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,888

He's got a gun.

Merry Christmas, Maggie!

259
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,533
Was Maggie a good little girl?

260
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,367
She was?!

261
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:29,003
Well, you did such a good job, Mr. Gnome,

262
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,501

00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,484
{\an8}-(laughing)
-(grunting)

347
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,270
{\an8}You're sure you want to do this, Dad?
Seems kind of meshugana.

348
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,614
{\an8}I want to be a total Christian
for you, babe,

349
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,320
{\an8}so I'm gonna shpritz my tuchis...

350
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,941
{\an8}Be careful of the current.

351
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,528
{\an8}Don't worry,
I haven't been current in years.

352
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,493
{\an8}-(laughs boisterously, groans)
-(laughter)

353
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,080
(laughter continues)

354
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,289
Huh? Huh? Oh.

355
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:28,506
Oh, great, my death is
a hacky parody of <i>Frozen.</i>

356
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,295
Dad? But who's the moose?

357
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,974
I'm your first agent.

358
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,643
Oh, this is the most we've ever spoken.

359
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,182
-(cell phone rings)
-(groans)

360
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,596
I must be dead.

361
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:41,984
You're not dead yet.

362
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,981
Listen, I should know, because I am.

363
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,323
And life was no picnic,
but let me tell you,

364
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,978
death is no picnic, either.

365
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,687
Your biggest mistake
is expecting picnics.

366
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,858
Dad!

367
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:55,025
Oh, I suppose you're not happy
that I'm converting.

368
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:58,365
Herschel, your heart just stopped,
so I'll make this very quick.

369
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,332
There's no one religion
that makes you a good father.

370
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,503
All you got to do
is think of your children

371
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,332
before yourself, that's all...

372
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,167
except with those oxygen masks
that you get on the planes.

373
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,843
There it's vice-a-versa.

374
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,592
Well, I guess you would know.

375
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,683
You're a rabbi
who's seen the face of God.

376
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,010
Actually, I'm a hallucination
caused by cell death

377
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,506
in your suffocating brain.

378
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,847
Also, I saw you texting
during my funeral.

379
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,444
-For shame!
-(cries out)

380
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,021
Oh, reel him in.
You've caught a drowning man!

381
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,477
Slow down.

382
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,316
First I'm gonna play him a little.

383
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,778
"I shall be a fisher of men."

384
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,211
(ice breaking)

385
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,040
I'm alive! Oh, ho!

386
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,997
Don't tell my ex-wife.

387
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,046
(whooping and cheering)

388
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,552
Lovejoy is a hero!

389
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,724
Finally, something I can explain!
