Do you think my drink has
something to do with it?

Who can say? It's probably
a combination of things.

182
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,341
Another pitcher of those
amazing Flaming Moes.

183
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,760
I hate this joint,
but I love that drink.

184
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,339
Ohhh.

185
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,684
Barkeep, I couldn't
help noticing your sign.

186
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,100
The one that says
"Bartenders do it 'til you barf"?

187
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,349
No. Above that
store-bought drollery.

188
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,771
Oh, great. Why don't we
fill out an application.

189
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,900
I'll need your name,
measurements, and turn-ons.

190
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,148
You really expect me
to tell you my measurements?

191
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,771
You could,
but I find this way

192
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,317
is much more accurate,
and fun.

193
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,821
Ugh! What do you offer
in the way of salary?

194
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,284
Minimum wage and tips.

195
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,414
Of course,
there are fringe benefits.

196

197

Oh, yeah? Hey, what's
Mr. McStagger really like?

210
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,522
Actually, there is no
Tipsy McStagger.

211
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,024
He's just a composite
of other successful logos.

212
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,527
Well, you tell him for me

213
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,818
that he makes
one great mozzarella stick.

Yes, fine, I will.

215

Keep talking.

is perfect for our
restaurant chain.

219

We want to buy the recipe.

220
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,998
No dice. The Flaming Moe
is not for sale.

221

Do you know how much

355
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,355
He may have come up
with the recipe

356
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,898
but I came up
with the idea

357
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,192
of charging $6.95 for it.

358
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,936
-(phone rings)
-Uh-- telephone.

359
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,647
Flaming Moe's.

360
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,107
Yes, I'm looking for
a friend of mine.

361
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,577
<i>Last name: Jazz.</i>
<i>First name: Hugh.</i>

362
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,828
Hold on. I'll check.

363
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,449
Hugh Jazz?

364
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,286
Somebody check the men's room
for a Hugh Jazz.

365
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,582
I'm Hugh Jazz.

366
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,665
Telephone.

367
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,249
Hello, this is Hugh Jazz.

368
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,504
Uh... hi.

369
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,666
<i>-Who's this?</i>
<i>-Bart Simpson.</i>

370
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,423
What can I do for you, Bart?

371
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,125
Look,
I'll level with you mister.

372
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,335
This is a crank call
that sorta backfired

373
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,505
and I'd like to bail out
right now.

374
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,894
Alright.
Better luck next time.

375
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,970
What a nice young man.

376
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,925
Homer, I'm sorry you're mad
at me, but this isn't personal.

377
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:53,977
This is business.

378
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,229
Business, eh?

379
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,521
Well, let me tell you something.

380
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,024
You just lost
yourself a customer.

381
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,185
What? I'm sorry.
Homer, I couldn't hear you.

382
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,864
I said, you just lost
yourself a customer!

383
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,283
-What?
-You just lost yourself a customer!

384
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,822
Homer, you're gonna
have to speak up.

385
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,196
You just lost yourself
a customer, Moe!

386
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,993
I forced myself to what?

387
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,576
You just lost
yourself a customer!

388
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,872
Homer, I'll talk
to ya' tomorrow.

389
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,365
You just lost yourself
a customer!

390
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,788
Yeah, you can use it.

What can I do

411
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,068
Well, sir, Tipsy McStagger
would like to buy your drink.

412
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,074
(gasps)
He's here?

413
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,485
No, no, no.

414
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,283
I mean my company is
willing to do what it takes

415
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,198
to get that recipe.

416
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,536
We're prepared
to offer you $1 million.

417
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,672
(all gasping)

418
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,169
Sorry, Harv,
but like I told you before

419
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,592
it ain't for sale.

420
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,920
Don't be stupid!

421
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,585
We have a laboratory for
this kind of thing.

422
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,133
We've got it all figured out,
except for one ingredient.

423
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,927
Brace yourselves, gentlemen.

424
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,851
According to
the gas chromatograph,

425
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,180
the secret ingredient is...

426
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,596
Love?!

427
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,774
Who's been screwing
with this thing?

428
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,563
I'm sorry, but the secret
ingredient dies with me.

429
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,977
30 cases of cough syrup.

430
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,646
-Sign here.
-(nervous laugh)

431
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,605

00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,043
Yeah, what do you want?!

435
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,290
-A beer.
-Okay, then.

436
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,133
Can I have a clean glass?

437
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,630

I'm sorry,

Ohh!

This all goes back to the
Frank Wallbanger case of '78.

448
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,817
How about that?
I looked something up.

449

These books behind me don't
just make the office look good.

450
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,826
They're filled with useful

Non-inventing,
recipe-stealing, pug-nosed--

453
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,615
Well, Homer, maybe you
can take some consolation

454
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,457
in the fact that
something you created

455
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,882
is making so many
people happy.

456
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,381
Ooh! Look at me.

457
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,473
I'm making people happy.

458
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,378
I'm the magical man

460
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,018
Oh, by the way,
I was being sarcastic.

461
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,641
Well, duh!

462
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,647
Now, that's what I call
a happy hour.

463
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,770
(deep sigh)

464
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,026
Morris, something troubles me.

465
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,689
Don't worry baby.

466
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,237
My mother won't be home
for another 20 minutes.

467
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,490
No. I was just thinking
about Homer Simpson.

468
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,743
That's okay.

469
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,235
I was just thinking
about Sybil Danning.

470
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,866
I meant, I think you
should sell your drink

471
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,874
and give half the money
to Homer.

472
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:44,916
But, honey--

473
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,788
He's your friend, Morris,

474
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,915
and you took advantage
of him.

475
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,213
All right.
All right.

476
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,626
I'll split the million

to mow the lawn today?

482
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,394
Okay, but you promised me
Moe money.

There's a Moetinee.

487
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,069

I really need
my drumsticks.

510

Come and get 'em!

511
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,293
You're going to be
a rich man, Moe.

512
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,791
I gotta tell you.
The way we usually work

513
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,254
in these situations is
to steal the recipe

514
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,415
and run the inventor
out of business.

515
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,883
Ah, <i>c'est la vie.</i>

516
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,013

00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,130

"How does he do it?"

524
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,603
Well, I'm going to tell you.

526
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,685

529
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,657
Nothing but plain, ordinary,
over-the-counter

530
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,698
children's cough syrup.

531
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,372
(laughs maniacally)

532
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,371
Shoot.

533
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,122
Thank you, Mr. Nutball.

534
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,794
Got to go, Moe.
Tough luck.

535
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,995
Aaaaaaaahhh!

536
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,044
Holy cow,
you just fell

537
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,377
on Aerosmith!

538
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,218
MOE: Hey, Homer.

539
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,517
Come in here.

540
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,890
Hi, Moe.

541
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,137
Where's that waitress
of yours?

542
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,308
She left to pursue
a movie career.

543
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,357
Frankly, I think she
was better off here.

544
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:20,532
Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

545
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,282
Oh, hey, hey.

546
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,704
Maybe some things are too good
to be kept a secret.

547
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,783
I guess so.

548
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,287
Compliments of the house--

549
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,119
one Flaming... Homer.

550
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:33,165
HOMER: Aw, thanks, Moe.

551
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,300
You're the greatest friend
a guy could ever have.

552
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,298
Hey, do you think Aerosmith
will be in tonight?

553
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,421
MOE: I doubt it.
