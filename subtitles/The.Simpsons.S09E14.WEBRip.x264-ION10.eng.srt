00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,450
Except that we're all moving
to the Movementarian agricultural compound

169
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,278
-to be near the Leader and serve him.
-I'm not leaving my home.

170
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,374
(door opens)

171
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,909
(chuckles) Oh, yes, you are.
I'm afraid it's our home now.

172
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,253
This house will become the new
local welcome center for this district.

173
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,540
And it didn't cost us a dime.

174
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:23,424
<i>Springfield has been overrun by a strange</i>
<i>and almost certainly evil sect</i>

175
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,593
<i>calling themselves "the Movementarians."</i>

176
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,841
<i>In exchange for your home</i>
<i>and all your money,</i>

177
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,514
<i>the leader of this way-out</i>
<i>and wrong religion</i>

178
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:34,223
<i>claims he'll take believers away</i>
<i>on his spaceship to the planet Blisstonia.</i>

179
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,515
<i>Excuse my editorial laugh. </i>(laughs) <i>but--</i>

180
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,727
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I've just learned</i>
<i>of a change in this stations management.</i>

181
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:46,983
<i>Welcome, Movementarians.</i>
<i>Continue to improve our lives.</i>

182
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:51,858
<i>I love you, perfect Leader, and new CEO</i>
<i>of KBBL Broadcasting.</i>

183
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,036
Homer Simpson, your family will be
housed here

184
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,158
for the first 100,000 years.

185
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,666
-Then something might open up in a double.
-(chuckles) Why even unpack?

186
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,879
-(groans)
-Dad and all these other people

187
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,710
are obviously the products
of mental conditioning.

188
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,716
Yeah. Maybe it'll wear off,
like his interest in CB radio.

189
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,429
That's a negatory, good buddy!

190
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,599
I kind of think it's cool. Just pretend
you're in a zombie movie.

191
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,719
Besides, this is just another place

192
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,516
{\an8}for me to wreak my special brand
of hysterical havoc.

193
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,440
{\an8}These rubes in robes haven't met the likes
of Bart Simpson before.

194
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,321
(cackles)

195
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,161
{\an8}I love the Leader.

196
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,449
{\an8}Of course you do.

197
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,697
This so-called "new religion"

198
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:42,366
is nothing but a pack
of weird rituals and chants

199
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,456
designed to take away the money of fools.

200
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:49,883
Let us say the Lord's Prayer 40 times,
but first let's pass the collection plate.

201
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,012
{\an8}(chuckles nervously) Looks like
slim pickings today, Reverend.

202
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:58,352
Oh, Lord. Uh, try
the emergency plate, Ned.

203
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,311
{\an8}-I don't think that's gonna do it.
-Um...

204
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:05,314
See, Marge? Our lives
are so much better now.

205
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,110
(over P.A.) <i>You two, stop talking</i>
<i>and resume the lima bean harvest.</i>

206
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:12,191
When we got married, you promised me
my harvesting days were over.

207
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,858
{\an8}-(all murmuring)
-MAN: What's going on?

208
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,407
-Whoa.
-What's going on?

209
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,290
Look! The forbidden barn opens.

210
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,408
-(all gasping)
-WOMAN: He's coming!

211
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,416
(all chattering)

212
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,633
Oh, boy. We get to see the Leader pass by.

213
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,972
{\an8}We toil in the fields, and he rides around
in a Rolls-Royce?

214
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,129
Yes, it would be nice
if he'd buy American,

215
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,297
but what are you gonna do?

216
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,768
I'm covered in the dust
of the Leader. He favors me!

217
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:45,059
I am even dustier. Dustier than thou!

218
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,437
Oh, look who the new pet is.

219
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,685
I've never been so happy.

220
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,574
{\an8}Smithers, why haven't I heard
of this "the Leader"?

221
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,537
{\an8}He's as rich and wicked as I,
but he seems to enjoy tax-exempt status.

222
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,079
(chuckles) Actually, sir,
with our creative bookkeeping

223
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,373
and corporate loopholes, we only pay
three dollars a year.

224
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,537
{\an8}(gasps) You're right.
We're getting screwed.

225
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,877
{\an8}There must be
something I can do about this.

226
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,800
{\an8}Wait. Yes.

227
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,092
{\an8}I think I know just the thing.

228
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,796
(cackling)

229
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,598
{\an8}Uh, sir?

230
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,848
{\an8}You have to tell me what your plan is,
or-or nothing will happen.

231
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,898
{\an8}Oh, yes. Of course. The plan.

232
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,071
{\an8}-You see me as a god, right, Smithers?
-Absolutely, sir.

233
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,991
-You'd kneel before me.
-Boy, would I!

234
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:41,531
Yes. Uh, then I'll form my own religion
with its own symbol.

235
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,737
{\an8}We'll use this special "K."

236
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,118
I believe that's already
a breakfast cereal, sir.

237
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,245
{\an8}-And people worship it?
-In a way.

238
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,502
{\an8}All right then. Uh, how about this?

239
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,415
Uh, why don't you leave
the symbol to me, sir?

240
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,895
{\an8}Ladies and gentlemen, behold your new god,

241
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,572
Mr. Burns.

242
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,530
{\an8}-(all gasp)
-Ahoy-hoy, lowly mortals.

243
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:25,294
In addition to working for me,
you may now praise me as your Almighty.

244
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,039
{\an8}Amen, sir. Mmm!

245
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,167
(groaning)

246
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,302
{\an8}(screams)

247
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:40,591
Uh, we'll try this again tomorrow.

248
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,966
{\an8}Ah, he's all right. But he's no bowl
of Special "K."

249
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,306
This is ridiculous. We're already married.

250
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,891
But, Marge, we're not mass married.

251
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,606
At least you got to choose your mate.

252
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,980
We got matched up on the printout.

253
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:00,947
-Hey. Remember our agreement. I'm the man.
-You're the man!

254
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,490
{\an8}-I could have done a lot worse, Mother.
-Speak for yourself.

255
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,410
So, do you enjoy comic books?

256
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,583
{\an8}And who can tell me where thunder
and lightning come from?

257
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,246
Yes, Bart?

258
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,745
The Leader, ma'am.

259
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:19,546
{\an8}Very good, Bart.
And who invented Morse code?

260
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,092
Oh. I should know this one.

261
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,136
The--The Leader?

262
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,890
{\an8}Ah. Correct again.

263
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,811
He's wrong! You're wrong!

264
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,690
the whole damn system is wrong! (screams)

265
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,149
What's the matter, Lisa?

266
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,227
You used to be such a good student.

267
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:41,146
{\an8}Don't you want to please your teachers
and get good grades?

268
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,947
{\an8}(sighs) Grades?

269
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:47,241
(to the tune of "This Old Man")
<i>♪ We love him, he loves we ♪</i>

270
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,496
<i>♪ We're the leader's family ♪</i>

271
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:55,043
These lima beans are even better than
the ones we had for breakfast and lunch.

272
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,545
Oh! A lima bean that looks
just like the Leader!

273
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,969
{\an8}-I'll put it with the others.
-Homer.

274
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,968
You know I always try to put
the best face on everything,

275
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,641
but there's no face on that damn bean!

276
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,470
We hate it here!
And your family wants to leave.

277
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,517
BART AND LISA: No, we don't, Mother.

278
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,100
We love the Leader.

279
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,105
No!

280
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,356
All righty. Time for bed.

281
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,283
{\an8}I'm leaving this place,
and you'd better step aside.

282
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,036
Lady, people are free to go
whenever they wish.

283
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:31,945
(people groaning)

284
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,328
-(growling)
-(barking)

285
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,092
Hi-yah!

286
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,684
(barking)

287
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,729
(screaming)

288
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:12,115
{\an8}Oh. I never thought
I'd have to do this again.

289
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,582
{\an8}(panting) Reverend Lovejoy!

290
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,123
(coughs) You've gotta help me.

291
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:21,047
My entire family has been taken in
by the evil Movementarians.

292
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:24,918
{\an8}Oh, I feel for you, my child,
and I'd like to help you.

293
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,046
(clears throat)

294
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,345
(groans)

295
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,850
(clinks)

296
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,720
Now, how are we going to
get my Homie back?

297
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,886
-(screeching sound)
-I'll kidnap him for 50,

298
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:39,936
deprogram him for 100,
and I'll kill him for 500.

299
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,942
No, no, no. Just the first two.

300
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,114
All right. I'll throw in
the killing for free.

301
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:48,323
-(vehicle approaching)
-TOGETHER: Yay! Here comes the leader!

302
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,409
What an honor. We've been called
into the presence of--

303
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,537
(all grunting)

304
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,917
Marge? You're the Leader?

305
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,801
You don't look anything like the beans.

306
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:06,418
-Knock him out, Reverend!
-Ow! Ooh!

307
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,417
Ow!

308
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,298
Oh, the devil has given him
superhuman strength.

309
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,506
Give me that, you noodle-armed choir boy!

310
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,267
-Ow!
-Well, that didn't do it, Mr. Kilt.

311
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,520
Look. Let's the three of us
try it together.

312
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,902
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

313
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,690
Oh! Ooh! Why?

314
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:29,697
Oh, you're gonna break like matchsticks
I promise you that!

315
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,740
Hey. I made some Rice Krispie squares

316
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,534
for our hungry deprogrammerinos.

317
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:37,957
Aw, man! You ruined
the atmosphere, ya daft pansy!

318
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,118
Well, this is my rumpus room.

319
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,577
Ach! Don't call it that!

320
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,461
Outsiders have kidnapped
some of our property.

321
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,428
We must respond with our deadliest weapon.

322
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,008
The lawyers.

323
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,143
-(bell ringing)
-Go! Go! Go!

324
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,430
(chattering)

325
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,893
(siren wailing)

326
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,555
<i>Attention, all citizens.</i>

327
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,563
<i>Even though the leader himself</i>
<i>is completely nonviolent...</i>

328
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,555
(sirens wailing)

329
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:06,476
<i>...he urges you to be as violent</i>
<i>as you like in capturing the Simpsons.</i>

330
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,067
-(sirens stop)
-(tires screech)

331
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,952
(indistinct chattering)

332
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,280
What are you doing?
They're not here, you idiots!

333
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,986
Idiots? That's slander, sir,
and we have it on tape.

334
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,367
All right. I'll get out
my checkbook. (grumbles)

335
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,495
-What was that?
-Ah, I said-- (grumbles)

336
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,842
So, you kids really love the Leader, huh?

337
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,498
Even more than your parents?

338
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,587
-Yeah. No contest.
-Of course. Absolutely.

339
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,802
All right already.
But do you love the Leader

340
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,724
more than having your very own
brand-new hover bikes?

341
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,144
(spacial humming)

342
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,722
(both gasp)

343
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,390
What do you have to say
about the Leader now, huh? Huh?

344
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,598
-The hell with him.
-What Leader?

345
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,057
He can take a flying leap
as long as I am concerned.

346
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,777
-And who do you love now?
-BOTH: Hover bikes!

347
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,358
(groans) Close enough.

348
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,859
BOTH: Yay!

349
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,283
-(all groan)
-(laughs)

350
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,866
Sorry, kids. There's no
such thing as hover bikes.

351
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,162
They're just a couple of
Huffys on a fishing line.

352
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,866
But we heard them hovering.

353
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,496
Oh, I'm afraid I played a dirty part
in this little charade.

354
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,254
(spacial humming)

355
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,416
-Well, can we at least keep the bikes?
-Oh, no. No, no. No, no, no.

356
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,926
They're due back at the store by 6:00.
Get off 'em. Get off. Off. Get off.

357
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,931
All right.

358
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:20,521
Now, what's so all-fire great
about your fancy-pants Leader?

359
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,229
The Leader knows all and sees all.

360
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,651
Ooh. Well, that is impressive.

361
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,900
And he's going to take us
to a wonderful new planet.

362
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:33,743
Oh, this Leader,
he sounds like a grand fella.

363
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,121
Willie, I'm not sure
we're making any headway here.

364
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,578
Would you shut up, woman.
He's talking about my leader.

365
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,369
{\an8}Uh, maybe we should take
a little break-a-rooney, huh?

366
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,503
{\an8}Anyone like a draft beer?

367
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,380
Beer? (salivating)

368
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,748
Would you like a tall, frosty one, Homer?

369
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,168
(grunting)

370
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,595
{\an8}HOMER: <i>No. Must resist temptation.</i>

371
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:03,349
<i>Go ahead. Give in. Beer! Beer!</i>

372
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,191
<i>Ooh. These cotton-poly blends</i>
<i>are so comfortable.</i>

373
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:11,441
Go on, Homer. Our commandments clearly
state that beer is all right.

374
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,645
Try some.

375
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,953
(chattering)

376
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,496
-This man is coming with us.
-Homer, you don't have to go with them.

377
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,369
But I want to go.

378
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,875
Well, I would say the matter is settled.

379
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,538
You know, I pride myself
on being a good host,

380
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,456
so I'm obliged to offer you a beer,

381
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:35,255
but I'm so darn mad
it's gonna be mostly head.

382
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,394
Homer, come back!

383
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:45,642
{\an8}-That's my husband!
-He's our husband now.

384
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,096
ALL: Yay!

385
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,187
I'm glad I'm back.

386
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,611
Because the moment that sweet, sweet beer
hit my tongue,

387
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,532
I was born again!

388
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,951
-(both gasp)
-Hallelujah!

389
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,740
Now I can show all of you
what I've come to realize.

390
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,624
The reason we're not allowed
in the forbidden barn

391
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,412
is because there is no
intergalactic spaceship.

392
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:09,366
He's taken our money just so he can...

393
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,421
build one hell of a spaceship!

394
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:16,763
-(all gasping)
-LEADER (on speaker): <i>Homer Simpson,</i>

395
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,299
<i>because of your lack of faith,</i>

396
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,724
<i>you've ruined mankind's chance</i>
<i>for salvation.</i>

397
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,604
{\an8}-Whoops.
-Nice going there, Homer.

398
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,731
{\an8}Oh, my gosh. Maybe he was telling
the truth about everything.

399
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,439
Oh, mercy. He's the real deal!

400
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,771
(vehicle humming)

401
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,031
{\an8}(humming)

402
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,075
(all groan)

403
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,332
Come back. Come back!

404
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,712
Willie still loves ya, O Great One!

405
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,080
(gasping and groaning)

406
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:00,722
Stranger, you're a-trespassing
on my dirt farm.

407
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,681
Uh, do you happen to need a messiah?

408
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,772
No, but I'll take
them sacks of money from ye.

409
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,178
(groans)

410
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,980
I should have stayed
with the Promise Keepers.

411
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:12,982
Damn it!

412
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,523
It fell apart like everything else
I've ever believed in.

413
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,357
Oh, I guess it's back to
good old-fashioned voodoo.

414
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,913
{\an8}Wow! I need a drink!

415
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,657
Come with me.

416
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,408
Uh, is that your collar, Reverend?

417
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:30,253
Uh, yes. (chuckles)
How did that get down there?

418
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,750
{\an8}Come back to papa, baby.

419
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:38,012
To think, I turned to a cult
for mindless happiness...

420
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,128
-when I had beer all along.
-(clears throat)

421
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:44,256
And you, Marge, the bringer of beer.

422
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,557
It's wonderful
to think for ourselves again.

423
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,099
You said it, Sister.

424
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,812
MAN: <i>You are watching Fox.</i>

425
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,442
TOGETHER: We are watching Fox.

426
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,363
(theme music plays)

427
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,359
Shh!

428
