Whoopie.

20
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,924
Move over Los Angeles and Philadelphia.

21
00:01:07,926 --> 00:01:11,611
It's Springfield's turn to
have its drunken sports fans

22
00:01:11,763 --> 00:01:14,931
climb streetlights and
burn down the town.

23
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:17,767
That's right, finally,
after years of phantom fouls

24
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:19,119
and butt fumbles,

25
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:23,030
one of our beloved local sports teams,
the "Pin Pals,"

26
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:24,958
have made it to the state championship.

27
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:28,220
With Springfield's years of
failure at sports, the arts,

28
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,797
and our disastrous
toddler boxing tournament,

29
00:01:30,874 --> 00:01:34,726
it's no exaggeration to say
that our "Super Bowlers" are

30
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,680
garnering tremendous pin-terest.

31
00:01:42,385 --> 00:01:43,385
_

32
00:01:44,463 --> 00:01:47,147
Finally, strikes I can support.

33
00:01:47,223 --> 00:01:48,148
_

34
00:01:48,224 --> 00:01:50,057
Mayor, you've been accused of being

35
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:52,152
a fair-weather fan for this team.

36
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:53,319
Not true.

37
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:56,063
I am a dyed-in-the-wool fan of these...

38
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:57,157
Bowlers.

39
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,066
Bowlers?! Really?

40
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,660
People still do that?

41
00:02:00,737 --> 00:02:03,830
So you don't mind that they say
you're jumping on the bandwagon?

42
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:07,759
Let me just say,
no one jumps later or harder than I.

43
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,430
To the Pin Heads, eh... Pin Pals.

44
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:20,680
<i>And now, your heroes, the Pin Pals.</i>

45
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:23,775
How you doing?

46
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,185
Marry me!

47
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:26,686
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.

48
00:02:26,763 --> 00:02:28,930
Anyhoo, I could never have made it

49
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:32,934
without my very good friends,
Homer, Carl, Flanders,

50
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:36,938
and that new guy from Portugal
whose, uh, name I forget.

51
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:40,305
_

52
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,480
_

53
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,689
Yi-yo-yu!

54
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:49,325
He don't speak the good
English or nothing,

55
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:51,327
but he sure as hell can roll strikes.

56
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:55,331
And he's got a very hot sister,
or girlfriend, or mother...

57
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,858
It's really hard to tell.

58
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,594
<i>Eu te amo.</i>

59
00:03:00,672 --> 00:03:02,021
All right. Based on my experience,

60
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,523
that is<i> not</i> his mother.

61
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,268
Uh, I just want to say,
we aren't just doing this for us.

62
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:11,197
It is going to mean the
world to this entire town.

63
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,940
Excuse me, but I don't see

64
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,535
how the town possibly
benefits from this.

65
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:16,795
We'd be helped a lot more

66
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,205
by a traffic light on Elm Street.

67
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:23,617
Smack him with his bone! Smack him good!

68
00:03:23,695 --> 00:03:25,619
Uh, my friends and neighbors...

69
00:03:25,697 --> 00:03:26,971
Reluctant neighbors.

70
00:03:28,514 --> 00:03:31,309
I'd just like us to, uh, bow our heads,

71
00:03:31,386 --> 00:03:33,052
- and thank...
- Stupid Flanders.

72
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,038
Turns everything good into church.

73
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,557
Just once, can you not mention God?

74
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:40,376
All righty, then,
let me just s-say way to go,

75
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:41,986
Big Guy in the Sky.

76
00:03:42,063 --> 00:03:45,565
And his son, Jesus Christ. Amen.

77
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:47,641
Jesus is God's rod.

78
00:03:48,776 --> 00:03:50,887
Jesus is God's rod.

79
00:03:51,468 --> 00:03:52,488
Blasphemy.

80
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:58,077
And now, O captain,
my captain, Homer Simpson.

81
00:03:59,898 --> 00:04:02,507
There's one word that defines this team.

82
00:04:02,584 --> 00:04:05,326
And that word isn't "can" or "might."

83
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:09,255
That word is, uh, wait a minute.

84
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,090
Cards out of order...

85
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,167
Can't read my own writing here.

86
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,428
Oh, okay, it's "will."

87
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,814
Yes, we will!

88
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:21,526
Let's go Pin Pals.

89
00:04:21,603 --> 00:04:23,528
Win that title.

90
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:26,089
Win that title!

91
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:30,660
- Let's get pickles.
- Let's get pickles.

92
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:32,853
All right folks, break it up.

93
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:35,039
Unless you're jerkin' a gherkin,
go on home.

94
00:04:39,437 --> 00:04:42,772
Oh, Homie. Today was magnificent.

95
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,032
I always thought bowling
was just an excuse

96
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,277
to get away from the kids
and drink a lot of beer.

97
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:51,055
What? No. Never. What?

98
00:04:51,132 --> 00:04:54,283
But now it's made the
whole town proud of you.

99
00:04:54,285 --> 00:04:56,377
And I'm part of the town,

100
00:04:56,454 --> 00:04:58,045
so this comes from the heart.

101
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:00,806
Ugh, I can't say it.
I don't want to say it.

102
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,792
You can't make me say it,
and I won't say it.

103
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:04,293
Or even think it!

104
00:05:04,295 --> 00:05:05,695
Aw, thank you, son.

105
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,889
I love you all. Water my plants.

106
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:10,724
You don't have any plants.

107
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:12,660
Then we're good. Bye.

108
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:27,817
Ain't this the life?

109
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:29,168
Whirly birding,

110
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,821
full can of soda, two bags of peanuts.

111
00:05:31,823 --> 00:05:33,322
I've never known such luxury.

112
00:05:33,324 --> 00:05:35,491
I could die right now a happy man.

113
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,435
This is your captain speaking.

114
00:05:37,512 --> 00:05:39,662
Please buckle up as we attempt to clear

115
00:05:39,664 --> 00:05:41,272
the treacherous mountain peak.

116
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:42,431
Wha...?!

117
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,195
No worries.
Every chopper in town takes this route.

118
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:57,697
Overweight? How is that possible?

119
00:05:57,773 --> 00:06:01,701
Pilot, five passengers,
five 14-pound balls...

120
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:03,628
Uh, I wanted a little extra oomph,

121
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:06,372
so I actually brought a 16-pound ball.

122
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,301
Me, too. By which I mean I
brought two 16-pound balls.

123
00:06:10,378 --> 00:06:12,712
Anyone else want to
brag about their balls?

124
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:14,138
I mean, seriously?

125
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:17,124
Fausto bring this. For good luck.

126
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,310
Yi-yo-yu!

127
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:23,815
I'm gonna have to put
her down on the mountain.

128
00:06:23,891 --> 00:06:26,109
Of all the times to be sober.

129
00:06:29,397 --> 00:06:31,614
This could be it.

130
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:33,115
_

131
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:35,326
At least I can say goodbye.

132
00:06:35,403 --> 00:06:37,220
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Marge...

133
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:40,389
<i>We're not home now,
so please don't rob us.</i>

134
00:06:40,391 --> 00:06:41,648
<i>Leave a message.</i>

135
00:06:42,392 --> 00:06:44,727
Listen, Marge, we've had our arguments,

136
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:47,413
we've had our things,
but thank God I have the time

137
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,156
to tell you how I really feel...

138
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:51,325
- <i>Mailbox full.</i>
- D'oh!

139
00:06:53,905 --> 00:06:54,905
_

140
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:56,764
_

141
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,688
Whee! Ah!

142
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,845
As your captain, one thing is clear:

143
00:07:11,923 --> 00:07:13,589
we must get off this mountain.

144
00:07:13,591 --> 00:07:15,258
And I'm no expert on mountains,

145
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,869
but I say down is this way.

146
00:07:18,194 --> 00:07:19,361
_

147
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:21,622
D'oh!

148
00:07:21,623 --> 00:07:22,623
_

149
00:07:24,952 --> 00:07:26,169
D'oh!

150
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:28,235
_

151
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,365
What the...?

152
00:07:31,442 --> 00:07:32,884
I wouldn't leave just yet, Homer.

153
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,386
Our new friend there
still hasn't woken up.

154
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,871
Oh, God! Spanish-what's-his-name.

155
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:40,808
It's Portuguese-what's-his-name,
you idiot.

156
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,468
<i>Chief?</i>

157
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,787
- Is there any word?
- 'Fraid not.

158
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:47,473
Apparently they knocked
out a cell phone tower

159
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,715
on the way down.

160
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:51,627
Wait, wait!
Uh, now we're getting somewhere.

161
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:52,904
- _
- Yeah.

162
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:56,816
Oh, thank God, man.
I was starting to lose all hope.

163
00:07:56,892 --> 00:07:58,651
Oh, you hungry cops

164
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:00,303
put-a my kids through college.

165
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:03,414
Seven-a sisters.
Not the women's colleges.

166
00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:05,083
I have-a seven daughters:

167
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:08,235
Gia, Mia, Pia, Tia, Zia,

168
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:10,996
Iphigenia, and then Emily,
for some reason.

169
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,131
I don't know.

170
00:08:13,668 --> 00:08:16,076
Hmm, still barely breathing.

171
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,763
If the Lord could carry His cross,

172
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,990
I can carry this poor soul.

173
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:22,992
<i>Huh? Well, look at that.</i>

174
00:08:22,994 --> 00:08:26,604
<i>Flanders risking his own
life to save another.</i>

175
00:08:26,681 --> 00:08:27,685
<i>Wow.</i>

176
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:30,015
Homer, could you get my water bottle?

177
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,567
No.

178
00:08:35,831 --> 00:08:37,782
A phone! Someone's got cell service.

179
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,525
Hello, Moe speaking.

180
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,527
Hi, I'm looking for a Mr. Simpson.

181
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,012
First name, Homer.

182
00:08:43,014 --> 00:08:44,680
Oh, I recognize that voice.

183
00:08:44,682 --> 00:08:46,198
You ever call me again, you little puke,

184
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,794
I'm gonna cut you up,
use your intestines as violin strings,

185
00:08:49,871 --> 00:08:51,537
and play "Flight of the Bumblebee!"

186
00:08:51,689 --> 00:08:54,281
I'm gonna go Rimsky-Korsakov on yas.

187
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,617
I'm just trying to find my dad.

188
00:08:56,694 --> 00:08:58,878
Yeah, right.
Try looking in hell, hell boy!

189
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:00,696
<i>Ay caramba!</i>

190
00:09:00,698 --> 00:09:02,214
Moe, you idiot!

191
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,642
You were the only one
with cellular service.

192
00:09:05,574 --> 00:09:07,961
What have I done?
Me and my anger issues.

193
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:11,056
Dr. Rubenstein's gonna
be so disappointed.

194
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,302
Stupid avalanche.

195
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:23,386
No connection.

196
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:24,887
And it's almost night.

197
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,890
I feel so much regret.

198
00:09:27,892 --> 00:09:31,744
I never got the chance to
tell my son I loved him.

199
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,655
Never? You're 87 years old.

200
00:09:34,732 --> 00:09:37,066
Uh, it was on my "to do" list.

201
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:38,083
Take a look.

202
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,193
See?

203
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:43,535
_

204
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,725
Still no sign of the missing bowlers.

205
00:09:46,802 --> 00:09:48,227
And one thing I must say now,

206
00:09:48,303 --> 00:09:50,470
there is nothing a
newscaster loves better

207
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,897
than missing people,

208
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,824
be they on a mountain, in a submarine,

209
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:56,142
or, preferably, deep under rubble.

210
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,736
Even if we know they're dead,

211
00:09:57,813 --> 00:09:59,813
we'll keep it quiet for a few days,

212
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,557
just to keep the ratings up.

213
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,818
And now, tonight's lotto,
which no one ever wins.

214
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,462
_

215
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,488
No...!

216
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,416
Why am I talking like this?

217
00:10:11,493 --> 00:10:14,920
I'm not falling,
just clinging to the edge!

218
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:19,517
Oh, man, that was close.
How deep is that thing, anyway?

219
00:10:19,593 --> 00:10:22,520
Only one way to find out.

220
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:30,419
Gentlemen,
I fear we're starting to hallucinate.

221
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,862
That's crazy talk.

222
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:34,031
Barney, pick up the spare.

223
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:42,522
Listen to me. Time to get your
cuckoos back in your clocks.

224
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,933
We're approaching the
point of no return.

225
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,319
Flanders, h-how do I put this?

226
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,029
I was thinking I might want to...

227
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,215
oh, this is so embarrassing...

228
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,341
pray.

229
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:56,036
There are no atheists in foxholes.

230
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,113
Oh, yes. Foxes are very religious.

231
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,783
I'd be praying if a bunch of
guys in red vests on horses

232
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,134
were trying to kill me.

233
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,286
Now, make with the Our Father.

234
00:11:06,473 --> 00:11:09,124
<i>Still no word on the Springfield team.</i>

235
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:13,153
<i>Please observe an anticipatory
60-second moment of silence.</i>

236
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:17,908
Wasn't me.

237
00:11:19,394 --> 00:11:20,494
Strike.

238
00:11:22,156 --> 00:11:25,249
My friends, if we just
have faith in the good Lord

239
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:27,418
who blew us to bits on
the side of the mountain,

240
00:11:27,494 --> 00:11:28,586
we'll be okay.

241
00:11:28,662 --> 00:11:31,738
Hey, Churchy Joe,
tell that to my piggies!

242
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,424
The word "frostbite" sounds so cutesy

243
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,984
when people get it at
Buffalo Bills games,

244
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,244
but when it happens to you, ugh!

245
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:41,824
Well, I think things will be just fine.

246
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,676
Really? And who made you Optimist Prime?

247
00:11:44,753 --> 00:11:48,013
I broke open my first aid kit.

248
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:50,924
Anybody else holding out on anything?

249
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,592
Like me with these two bags of peanuts,

250
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,655
which I'm going to eat right
now despite my peanut allergy.

251
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:04,121
See this?
This is the face of a survivor.

252
00:12:05,774 --> 00:12:08,367
Uh, Christmas decorations?

253
00:12:08,443 --> 00:12:10,443
Uh, in October?

254
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,297
We've done everything we can
to help your father, so...

255
00:12:13,374 --> 00:12:16,024
I thought this would
help us feel better.

256
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,621
Bart, they say a kid is only as happy

257
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,623
as their saddest parent.

258
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:31,464
Zoom in on the heartbroken family.

259
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,816
Zoom, I say!

260
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,318
No. I can't.

261
00:12:34,395 --> 00:12:36,728
I didn't go to journalism
school to be a ghoul.

262
00:12:36,805 --> 00:12:38,822
I went because it was an easy major.

263
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:42,718
Take your soul and get the
hell out of local news.

264
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,287
Fausto... not good.

265
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:48,390
My friend, we will get you back

266
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:51,651
and then you and I will
have a grand old time.

267
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,486
I hear you silently agreeing.

268
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,248
We'll go fishing and make s'mores

269
00:12:56,324 --> 00:12:58,233
and we'll be best friends.

270
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,843
You're a Catholic and I'm a Christian,

271
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,586
but we'll work through that.

272
00:13:01,663 --> 00:13:03,847
Ooh, more silent agreement.

273
00:13:03,924 --> 00:13:05,424
Here, my friend, let me...
let me set you down

274
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,559
so we can talk about our great future.

275
00:13:08,762 --> 00:13:11,430
Save your breath, pal. He's dead.

276
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,266
No! No, he's not dead.
H-He's just resting.

277
00:13:14,342 --> 00:13:16,585
Oh, Lord, you can't be this cruel.

278
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,755
Sorry, man.
I knew he was a goner a while ago,

279
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,940
but I liked watching you carry him.

280
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:23,592
We were gonna make s'mores.

281
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,278
Now there'll just be s'nothing.

282
00:13:26,354 --> 00:13:28,855
Poor Fausto. Poor Flanders.

283
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,690
You really tried, man.

284
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,267
Oh, I mean it.

285
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,119
I'm not just hugging
you because you're warm,

286
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:35,954
although that's a big part of it.

287
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:37,214
You're a good man.

288
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,216
Homer, I knew you had a heart.

289
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:41,534
Just like the Cowardly Lion.

290
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:45,055
He always had a heart.
What he lacked was courage.

291
00:13:45,132 --> 00:13:47,707
And the Scarecrow lacked straw, right?

292
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,284
No, he was nothing but straw.

293
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,879
Wow. I'm looking at
everything with new eyes.

294
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:54,790
Just like the Tin Man.

295
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,808
That's not what the Tin Man...

296
00:13:56,885 --> 00:13:58,310
Look, just give me another hug.

297
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:02,722
All right, gentlemen,
there's a subject we need to discuss.

298
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,892
Now we've waited long enough,
I'm just going to say it:

299
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,412
It is time that we
resorted to cannibalism.

300
00:14:08,489 --> 00:14:09,580
Mmm.

301
00:14:09,656 --> 00:14:11,823
What? No. Absolutely not.

302
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,492
I'm not saying we eat him.

303
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:16,119
I'm saying we prepare him to be eaten.

304
00:14:16,196 --> 00:14:18,738
If he gets frozen,
we'll just end up with junk food,

305
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,649
like his hair or his toenails.

306
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,651
What?

307
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,926
Stop! Stop! Stop!

308
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:25,337
Bawk! Bawk! Bawk!

309
00:14:25,413 --> 00:14:27,931
Just gimme a wing. Come on.
You got two, come on!

310
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:30,184
No eating people.

311
00:14:32,587 --> 00:14:34,396
_

312
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,128
_

313
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,325
<i>If I eat these,
and don't share them...</i>

314
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:41,085
<i>it breaks every value I have.</i>

315
00:14:41,162 --> 00:14:44,739
<i>But just thinking about it
also means I've sinned. Hmm.</i>

316
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:46,741
<i>I must say,
it's a lot easier to have this debate</i>

317
00:14:46,743 --> 00:14:48,518
<i>with my mouth full of matzah.</i>

318
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:50,353
Flanders?

319
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,672
- Yes?
- It's so clear to me now.

320
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,357
You're the better man, Ned.

321
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:55,600
Well, that's not true.

322
00:14:55,602 --> 00:14:57,477
You've got the highest
average on the team.

323
00:14:57,512 --> 00:14:58,862
I'm nothing compared to you.

324
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,272
Have you noticed I haven't called you
"stupid Flanders"

325
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:02,682
once on this mountain?

326
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:05,184
What do you want, a Nobel Peace Prize?

327
00:15:05,262 --> 00:15:08,187
Sorry, sorry, I really do appreciate it.

328
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:09,522
It's just that I've come to realize

329
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:11,766
I'm not a natural leader, like you.

330
00:15:11,768 --> 00:15:14,544
The Lord has a time and a
place for everyone, my friend.

331
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:16,271
Homer, if the high altitude

332
00:15:16,273 --> 00:15:17,789
hasn't turned your brain to mulch,

333
00:15:17,865 --> 00:15:19,699
would you like to lead us in prayer?

334
00:15:19,776 --> 00:15:22,552
Heavenly father, who art in truck stop.

335
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:25,722
Ping-pong. Rock. Zipper. Jambalaya.

336
00:15:28,317 --> 00:15:29,317
Now, don't worry.

337
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:31,453
Just 'cause one of us has
a tickle in his whistle

338
00:15:31,455 --> 00:15:33,230
doesn't mean...

339
00:15:37,402 --> 00:15:40,645
We're in the tenth frame, people.

340
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:43,889
If you want me to eat youse later,
just say nothing.

341
00:15:57,814 --> 00:15:59,572
Chief, any news?

342
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:01,316
About what? Oh, right.

343
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:03,409
Um, Marge, with conditions

344
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:05,745
as bad as they are on that mountain,

345
00:16:05,822 --> 00:16:09,507
even if they somehow did
survive the crash, uh,

346
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:11,676
oh, how can I put this gently?

347
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:13,419
What do you mean, "gently"?

348
00:16:13,497 --> 00:16:15,272
You basically told me they're dead!

349
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:17,941
Will you please leave my family be?

350
00:16:18,756 --> 00:16:20,518
Never easy being a cop.

351
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,003
Then why did you become one?

352
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:24,856
'Cause I look great in blue.
It goes with my eyes.

353
00:16:24,932 --> 00:16:26,357
Your eyes are black.

354
00:16:26,434 --> 00:16:28,359
Well, I've wasted my life.

355
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,696
Patty and Selma?

356
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:34,124
Oh, this day couldn't get any worse.

357
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,442
Is what my dad would
say if he were alive.

358
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,020
Marge, dear, at a time like this,

359
00:16:39,022 --> 00:16:41,798
all we want to do is
sit and hold your hand.

360
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,259
No talk. Just love.

361
00:16:45,362 --> 00:16:47,620
I did want to say one thing:

362
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:49,639
"Better get your booty
shorts to the cleaners

363
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:52,124
"because you're gonna be
the most popular widow

364
00:16:52,202 --> 00:16:54,035
on the pickleball circuit."

365
00:16:54,037 --> 00:16:55,478
He's not dead!

366
00:16:55,555 --> 00:16:57,388
Well, we can't be sure...

367
00:16:57,465 --> 00:16:59,799
But we did use generative AI

368
00:16:59,876 --> 00:17:02,301
to make an image of Homer as a corpse.

369
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:04,487
To get you used to the idea, dear.

370
00:17:08,051 --> 00:17:10,327
Some of these we had
even before the crash.

371
00:17:10,403 --> 00:17:12,554
He's not dead. He's not dead!

372
00:17:12,556 --> 00:17:15,498
In fact,
I bet he's even going to save the day.

373
00:17:16,606 --> 00:17:18,560
Can you excuse us?

374
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:21,004
We need to go outside and laugh.

375
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:25,249
<i>Oh, is this it?</i>

376
00:17:25,326 --> 00:17:27,068
<i>My story ends now?</i>

377
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:31,806
<i>Buried in the snow, frozen alone
like broccoli in my freezer?</i>

378
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,579
My dear son, are you ready to join me?

379
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:40,523
I am, Mommy. Take me to the good place.

380
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,677
Um... That's not exactly where I am.

381
00:17:44,754 --> 00:17:47,589
They are very hard on
former left-wing radicals

382
00:17:47,591 --> 00:17:48,773
in the afterlife.

383
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,108
What are you saying?

384
00:17:50,184 --> 00:17:53,428
I'm in a place with a
lot of incredible people.

385
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,706
Machiavelli, Che Guevara,

386
00:17:56,858 --> 00:17:58,858
Casanova.

387
00:17:58,935 --> 00:18:01,861
Casanova. Oh, Casanova.

388
00:18:01,938 --> 00:18:06,958
I thought dying in 1798 would
keep me from being MeToo'd.

389
00:18:07,034 --> 00:18:08,802
Um... Um...

390
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:14,391
Mom? What are you making?

391
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:17,543
All of your father's favorites.
For when he comes back.

392
00:18:17,621 --> 00:18:19,712
Pork chops, glazed ham,

393
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:23,233
fried hooves, snout surprise.

394
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:25,977
Oh, I can't be in the
same room with that smell.

395
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:28,813
Yeah, it's pretty disgusting.

396
00:18:34,061 --> 00:18:35,394
<i>Hey, someone's cooking.</i>

397
00:18:35,472 --> 00:18:37,288
<i>Marge is cooking!</i>

398
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,083
I can't die here.

399
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,643
My family needs me.

400
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:43,311
My story is still being written.

401
00:18:43,313 --> 00:18:47,239
And the next word in it is<i> yeeargh!</i>

402
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,837
You're coming too, friends.

403
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,000
Hidilly doodily, Saviorino!

404
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:10,488
For once, Flanders, you owe me.

405
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,195
_

406
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:20,531
Homer Simpson. Hmm, what can I say?

407
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:24,127
He slept through Mass.
He'd floss with a Bible ribbon.

408
00:19:24,278 --> 00:19:28,113
I'm afraid he leaves behind no
good deed to remember him by.

409
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:32,952
Just another fat pinball
slipping past God's flippers.

410
00:19:33,884 --> 00:19:36,030
Here's something the
church never heard of:

411
00:19:36,032 --> 00:19:38,716
A guy coming back from the dead!

412
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:41,311
God bless him.

413
00:19:41,387 --> 00:19:44,147
My bald, beautiful boy.

414
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,798
No good deeds, Reverend?

415
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,209
I've got a new end for your eulogy:

416
00:19:48,211 --> 00:19:50,561
Thank God for Homer Simpson!

417
00:19:50,638 --> 00:19:53,990
That's my dad. Suck it, other dads.

418
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:58,052
You miss two birthdays and a school play

419
00:19:58,054 --> 00:20:00,747
and suddenly you're the bad guy.

420
00:20:03,484 --> 00:20:05,335
I knew you'd make it back.

421
00:20:05,486 --> 00:20:08,988
I knew it. I knew it.

422
00:20:09,065 --> 00:20:12,324
You were wrong. You were wrong!

423
00:20:12,402 --> 00:20:14,677
And you were wrong, preacher man.

424
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:16,513
Just premature.

425
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:20,499
I knew he'd make it.
Since five seconds ago.
