{\an8}Hey, I thought your mother
told you to take a bath.

11
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,052
{\an8}Yeah, Mom says a lot of things.

12

{\an8}Aw, I understand kids.

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,890
{\an8}I'm not a bath man myself--
more of a cologne man.

14
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,680
{\an8}Actually, we can't take a bath anyway.

HOMER: To Marge...

26
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,338
and all the blissful years

27
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,800
{\an8}I've spent hiding from her in this bar.

28
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,382
{\an8}ALL: Hear, hear.

29
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,927
{\an8}Yeah, big deal-- you got a wife.

30
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,470
I got a rash. Who cares?

00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,931
Uh, I'm sorry, Homer.

32
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,686
It's just-- it's been
four years since my last date

33
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,599
with a whatcha-call-it, uh, woman.

34
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,937
Whatever happened
to your mail-order bride?

35
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,323
Oh, she got homesick for her old life--

36
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,490
Diving for tourist pennies
in a Micronesian swamp.

37
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,110
So, her career got in the way.

38
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,697
Yeah. I don't blame her.

39
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,912
No girl wants to end up
with a Joe Puke-Pail like me.

40
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,003
Now, now, I won't hear of it, Moe.

41
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,659
You're a fabulous catch.

42
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:03,707
Oh, yeah?

43
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,080
Well, uh, how come I ain't
fending off movie starlets

44
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,587
with a pointy stick?

45
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,259
Oh, it's probably due to your ugliness,

46
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,628
but that doesn't mean we
can't find you a woman.

95
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,732
Yeah, well, the part that's showing.

104

105
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,905

106
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,956

Oh, well, thanks.

109
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,171
Yeah, it kind of draws the eye
away from the old mug.

110
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,125
I like a face with character.

111
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,675
Let's get out of here, Moe.

112
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,928
This is going nowhere.

113
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,339
Yeah, I...

114
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:25,557

you'd ever want to, uh--

115
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,680
I don't know-- get together sometime?

116
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,517
You mean, like a date?

117
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,693
Well, I don't know.

118
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,941
Oh, what was I thinking?

119
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,942
A-a beautiful girl like you
and a gargoyle like me.

120
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,935
-I-I'm sorry.
-Hold on, hold on.

121
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,277
-I didn't say "no" exactly.
-Really?

124
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,615

I didn't mean any disrespect.

I just can't figure it out.

153
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,949
Well, to be honest,
at first, it was just pity...

154
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,200
Ah.

155
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,781
Yeah, it's like out
of a storybook, ain't it?

156
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,947
But he's really grown on me.

157
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,366
He's got this insecure, sweaty charm...

158
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,786
Oh, yeah, I got that.

159
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,544
And he's so thoughtful.

160
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,536
Last night, he bought

161
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,957
all the seats in a movie theater

162
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,375

a romantic evening together.

163
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,514

167
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,926
and slashing guts and kicking throats.

168
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,354
-It's OK, Moe.
-I'm sorry.

169
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,352

174
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,776

00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,451

179
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,985

something nice on the card

180
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,657
like, um... uh, "Renee, my treasure..."

181
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,827
(Barney laughing)

182
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,956
Hey, shut up

183
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,752
or I'll ram a stool down your throat!

184
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,706
Uh, no, no-no,
I don't want that on the card.

185
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,717
Well, let me hear how it sounds.

186
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,675
Nah, nah, take it out. Take it out...

187
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,510
And charge it to my Players Club card.

188
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,846
Maxed out?

189
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,061
(sighs) Look, I really need
these flowers, OK?

190
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,652
I got a real tenuous hold
on my girlfriend here...

191
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,648
(dial tone)

192
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,649
Hello?

193
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,690
Hello?

194
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,943
(grunts)

195
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,029
Well, that's it. It's all over.

196
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,361
Renee ain't going to want to hang around

197
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,106
with no Joe Pinchpenny.

198
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,737
Aw, come on, Moe.

199
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,334
Think of all you have
to offer besides money.

200
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,700
Hmm.

201
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,912
I need cash and lots of it.

202
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,747
Um, all right, everybody,
I'm calling in your bar tabs.

203
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,503
(clamoring)

204
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,956
You bunch of ungrateful ingrates!

205
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,416
You... Aw, Homer, what am I going to do?

206
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,047
Renee's my last chance for true love.

207
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,295
If you really need money,

208
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,346
you could sell a kidney
or maybe even your car.

209
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,807
Nah, my car ain't worth nothing...

210
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,898
But it is insured for five grand.

211
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,190
Homer, I need your help.

212
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,533
You got to steal this car
and wreck it for me.

213
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,529
Steal?

214
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,570
Oh, no, you got the wrong guy.

215
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,704
You dropped something.

216
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,070
Come on, Homer, I'm one
of your dearest friends.

217
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,198
When everybody said

218
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,834
you were too drunk to drive that time,

219
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,951
who gave you your keys?

220
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,418
Oh... You did, but I still don't know.

221
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,051
I can just imagine what Marge would say.

222
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:27,048
Homer, I insist you steal that car.

223
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,471
I'll do it!

224
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,144
OK, here's the plan.

225
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,561
This model car represents my car, huh?

226
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,141
And this olive is you. Now...

227
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,647
Mmm... Me.

228
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,058
Hey, hey! Aw, that's great.

229
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,976
Now the car's going
to have to represent you

230
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:48,485
and this little toy man
will represent the car...

231
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,109
All right, forget it,
forget it. Listen up here.

232
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,196
Tomorrow night at 8:00,

233
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,490
you go down to the waterfront
and you "steal" my car.

234
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,535
What about the cops?

235
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,738
That's the beauty part.

236
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,037
Every cop in town's going to be

237
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,080
on the police department's
moonlight charity cruise

238
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,535
And I'm gonna be right there with them.

239
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,625
So, as soon as you get back

240
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,341
we steal the car, right?

241
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,971
Ri... No, no, wrong.

242
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,008
Listen, while I'm on the boat
with the perfect alibi,

243
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,013
you steal my car and park
it on the railroad tracks.

244
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,846
Then when the 10:15 train
comes along-- wham!

245
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,063
Insurance company pays off 5,000 clams,

246
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,023
I keep showing Renee the sweet life.

247
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,484
You're a genius, Moe.

248
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,654
All your troubles will soon be over

249
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,112
for a couple of months.

250
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:34,527
(all gulping and smacking lips)

251
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,865
Why all the black?

252
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,910
Why all the pearls?

253
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,743
Why all the hair? Why anything?

254
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,498
You look a little nervous, Dad.

255
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,170
No, you look a little nervous, Lisa.

256
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,539
You're up to something, aren't you?

257
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,915
No. I'm just going out
to commit certain deeds.

258
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:50,974
(under breath) Suckers...

259
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,222
Thank you. Welcome, folks.

260
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,684
Have fun. Drink responsibly...

261
00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,894
Till we're a mile out.

262
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:00,984
(chuckles)

263
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,558
Uh, excuse me there, Officer.

264
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,063
You see my car there?

265
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,895
With the rubber hippie daisy,

266
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,650
space 7-a?

267
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,112
Uh, yeah, what about it?

268
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,191
I was just thinking

269
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,736
what a good parking job I did with it.

270
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,900
Yeah, hey, that is nice.

271
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:17,368
Hey, Lou! Lou, check out
that park job in 7-a.

272
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,450
Whoo-hoo-hoo! That's sweet.

273
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:24,285
(muted Dixieland playing)

274
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,423
(giggles)

275
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,919
I'm going to be the best car thief ever.

276
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,253
Hey!

277
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,958
Oh, no you don't!

(Big Band music playing)

297
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,545
Moe, you seem awfully distracted tonight.

298
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,848
And you're sweating a lot, even for you.

299
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,852
Am I?

300
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,273
Huh, hadn't noticed.

Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

305
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,856
I'll look up with you in one minute.

306
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:34,863
(train whistle blows)

307
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:35,954
(gasps) The train.

308
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,858
Do you hear that?
That's the train. (sighs)

309
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,947
Isn't that the most beautiful
sound you ever heard?

310
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,412
It's almost as sweet as your voice.

311
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,833
Aw...

312
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,658
Muah.

The train!

(tires screeching)

317
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,059
D'oh! I got to find
another way to wreck Moe's car.

318
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,694
(train whistle blows)

319
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,856
Oh, honey, this whole
evening was so wonderful.

320
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,401
Except when that drunken cop

321
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,404
started firing at those seagulls.

322
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,856
-(seagull squawking)
-(man screams) Get him off!

323
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,867
Yeah, yeah, the plan went off
without a hitch.

324
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:22,909
What plan?

WIGGUM: Hey, Moe.
Isn't that your car up there

327
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,918
with the rubber hippie daisy?

328
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,919
The one that was parked in 7-a?

329
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,001
Hey! Hey, what's it doing there?

330
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,207
It was supposed to be
on the railroad tracks.

331
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,678
No, I mean, the parking lot.

332
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,300
Homer, you moron.

333
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,426
Homer, you genius.

334
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,393
(chuckles)

335
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,934

338
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,266
Huh?

348
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,298
Huh.

349
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,641
Huh. Well, that car thief
can't hold his breath forever.

350
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,971
And if he can, chief?

351
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,056
Then God help us all.

352
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,941
(guns cocking)

353
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,821
Isn't that your friend Homer?

354
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:39,188
Oh, oh! Homer!

355
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,986
Oh, how... could you?

356
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,701
You're under arrest,
Simpson, for grand theft auto.

357
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:45,912
Now put up your hands.

358
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,624
(whimpers)

359
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:49,998
{\an8}(camera clicking)

360
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,159
Brilliant! Brilliant!

361
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,997
OK, let's do another, but this time,

362
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,712
try to look scarier.

363
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,712
Kind of like... (growls)

364
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,004
-Grr.
-Gorgeous! Gorgeous, baby.

365
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,088
That's it. That's it.

366
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,927
Your fingerprints
are just like snowflakes.

367
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,510
They're both very pretty.

368
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,135
LOU: Simpson! You have visitors.

369
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,515
Homer, did you really steal a car?

370
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,902
Whoa! Hang on a minute.

371
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,609
The guard said I had visitors coming.

372
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,819
Dad, we're the visitors.

373
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,649
Oh. Oh! Oh, great.

374
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,855
Listen, I know it looks bad,
but all I can tell you

375
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:28,197
is I destroyed that car
for all the right reasons.

376
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,794
I'd like to believe you...

377
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,080
That's my girl.

378
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,372
You just go home

379
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,165
and don't worry your
pretty blue head about it.

380
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,590
Moe will take care of everything.

381
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,669
Well, Dad, in the meantime,
here's a carton of smokes

382
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:41,924
you can use to buy stuff.

383
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,966
Aw, thanks, boy.

384
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,929
I'll give you two packs
for that candy bar.

385
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,930
-Three. Why, you little--
-(choking)

386
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,852
Guard! Guard!

387
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,930
(snoring)

388
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,186
MOE: Psst! Homer. Homer, wake up.

389
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,899
Moe! Oh, Moe, thank God you're here.

390
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,900
Yeah, congratulations, Homer.

391
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,782
The plan worked perfectly.

392
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,149
But I'm in jail.

393
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,565
Yeah, yeah, that's a...

394
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,203
That's a kick in the pants.

395
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,910
Moe, you got to get me out of here.

396
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,911
Tell the cops I didn't steal the car.

397
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,203
Say you lent it to me.

398
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,746
Yeah, I wish I could, Homer.

399
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,159
But if I change my story,

400
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,667
they're gonna throw me in here.

401
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,999
But, Moe, we're best friends.

402
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,917
Oh, cripes, the puppy dog look.

403
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:25,927
(sighs)

404
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,258
All right, all right.

405
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,393
I'll use the money to bail you out.

406
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,390
Hurry, Moe.

407
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,561
At 3:00, they're going to
put us in the exercise yard.

408
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,136
The exercise yard!

409
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,564
Is everything OK, honey?

410
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,896
Your shirt is so dry.

411
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,730
Yeah, yeah, I'm OK.

412
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,315
There's just something I got to do.

413
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,690
Oh, look at that-- Hawaii.

414
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,028
Oh, that looks so romantic.

415
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,789
Well, if Hawaii's what my baby wants,

416
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,328
Hawaii's what my baby gets.

417
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,672
Oh, no, that's too expensive.

418
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,958
Let's just get a can of poi

419
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,131
and eat it in the tub.

420
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,419
Nah, nah, nah, we're going
for the real thing.

421
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,713
First class all the way.

422
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,456
Come on, we can leave tonight.

423
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,050
(Hawaiian music playing)

424
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,306
Mmm.

425
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,231
Ten minutes till fresh air and exercise.

426
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,900
(gasps) Hurry up, Moe.
For the love of God, hurry up!

427
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,902
Hawaii, here we come.

428
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:28,863
(singing in Hawaiian)

429
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:29,906
(chuckles)

430
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,029
(in English) Hawaii?

431
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,905
What about Hawaii?

432
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,412
Moe? Who's going to Hawaii?

433
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,914
Am I going to Hawaii?

434
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,996
(clanging)

435
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,170
Stop saying "Hawaii" in there.

436
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,589
Let me out! I'm innocent!

437
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,171
I changed my mind!

438
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,836
I don't want to be in here anymore!

439
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:50,835
Forget it, Simpson.

440
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,086
You're going to the chair.

441
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,097
(gasps)

442
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,638
The interrogation chair.

443
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,642
(relieved sigh)

444
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,893
-Plug it in, boys.
-(gasps)

445
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,386
Ukelele...

446
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,727
Pineapples...

447
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,482
Beach pistol...

448
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,824
Scandalously revealing thong.

449
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,239
(eerie voice): Going somewhere?

450
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,568
Wha...?

451
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,741
(gasps)

452
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:12,912
Homer!

453
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,370
Moe...

454
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,871
You killed me.

455
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,004
Hey, no. No, y-you ain't dead.

456
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,791
Y-y-you're just in jail.

457
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,745
Oh, right.

458
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,295
Wait a second.

459
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,378
I'm in jail because of you.

460
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:32,724
You were my friend, and you betrayed me.

461
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,641
Oh, my God, he's right.

462
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,100
Oh, how could I treat a friend that way?
(grunts)

463
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,982
HOMER: Exactly.

464
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,349
Exactly!

465
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,808
(gulping)

466
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,228
Hey, get your mouth off of that.

467
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,687
RENEE: Were you yelling at me, Moe-Moe?

468
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,897
Huh? No. No, no, no.

469
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,567
It's just that, um...

470
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,275
(sighs)

471
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,156
Renee, there's something
I got to tell you.

472
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,203
Oh, no.

473
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,576
You're gay, aren't you?

474
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,372
Oh, boy, Renee, you sure can pick them.

475
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,787
Nah, it ain't that.

476
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:05,955
What, so you're married?

477
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,383
No, no.

478
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,131
I-- Hey, why did you say "gay" first?

479
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,224
Mm-hmm.

480
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,719
Would you care for some reading material?

481
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,966
Hmm... This could be useful.

482
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,058
(grunts)

483
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,651
So, like a coward,

484
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,071
I let Homer take the rap
for the whole scam.

485
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,440
And now, the only way to clear him

486
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,147
is to turn myself in.

487
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,607
I-I don't know what to say.

488
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,657
I'm shocked.

489
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,830
I mean, you broke the law
and betrayed a friend.

490
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,620
Yeah, you're right.

491
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,913
You shouldn't be wasting your time

492
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,826
with a lowlife like me.

493
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,075
Oh, Moe, don't say that.

494
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,706
You made a mistake,

495
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,843
but at least you're trying
to set things straight.

496
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,050
Yeah, that's true.

497
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,170
That's true, baby. Hmm.

498
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,837
It'll be hell being locked away from you,

499
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,465
but I guess I got to take my medicine.

500
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,559
Unless...

501
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,599
Unless I send a letter
to the police clearing Homer.

502
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,604
Yeah?

503
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,095
Then we go to the graveyard
and steal two corpses.

504
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,107
Oh, my God.

505
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,768
We switch clothes with them
and leave them in the bar.

506
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,728
Then we pour some brandy around

507
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,488
like so...

508
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,860
Yeah, would you hand me my keys?

509
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,696
Uh, yeah. Here you go.

510
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,951
Then, we light a match.

511
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,872
And fwoof! We start a new life in Hawaii.

512
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,872
Good-bye, Moe.

513
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:23,873
Where you going, baby?

514
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,414
You going to find the corpses?

515
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,827
Yes, Moe, I'm going to find corpses.

516
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,585
Uh, well, you want me to come with?

517
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,631
Renee?

518
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,924
Dearest?

519
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:35,967
Ahh...

520
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,929
She ain't coming back.

521
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,010
Ow! Ow! Ow!

522
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,255
Uh-oh.

523
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,979
Must kill Moe.

524
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,888
Whee!

525
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,767
Must kill Moe.

526
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,145
Whee!

527
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,403
You!

528
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,695
Homer, thank God.

529
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,738
You gotta help me here.

530
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,491
Oh, I'll help you.

531
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,783
Help you die!

532
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,986
(yells)

533
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,655
All right, that's it.

534
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,414
You're going down, pal.

535
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,955
(both grunting)

536
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,498
(both coughing)

537
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,253
Oh, boy.

538
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,917
(coughing)

539
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,545
I really want to sleep.

540
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,932
{\an8}I... also sleep.

541
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,139
{\an8}Good night, Mommy.

542
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,475
{\an8}Moe! Homer!

543
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,768
{\an8}(screams)

544
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,101
{\an8}The booze!

545
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,704
{\an8}(wheezing and coughing)

546
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,906
{\an8}(groans)

547
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:50,955
Oh, Homer, I've been
the world's biggest rat.

548
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,291
Can you ever forgive me?

549
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:56,376
Oh, I could never stay mad at you, Moe.

550
00:20:56,463 --> 00:21:00,183
After all, you get me drunk.

551
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,933
Aw!

552
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,511
Ah, my poor bar.

553
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,015
It's all gone.

554
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,980
-(sobbing)
-Aw, Moe, Moe.

555
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,980
Moe, dry those beady little eyes.

556
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:18,114
Your buddy Homer'll get
you back on your feet.
