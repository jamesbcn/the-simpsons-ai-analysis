1
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,108
Thanks for hosting.

2
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,877
How was the sleepover?

3
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:13,046
They each had a 5-Hour Energy
drink and a jar of Nutella

4
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:16,250
and then watched Russian
dashcam videos all night.

5
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,552
Vodit znachit ubivat!

6
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,053
Listen, Marge.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,090
Every year, Kirk and I rent
a luxury villa in Costa Rica

8
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:26,727
and invite a few select families
to join us.

9
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,762
Maybe you've heard about it?

10
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:31,965
I've always dreamed
of being invited on this trip,

11
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,967
and now it's about to happen.

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,571
Play it cool, Marge,
like only you can.

13
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:38,939
Let me see.

14
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,943
Costa Rica...

15
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:43,977
Nope, nope.

16
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,515
Sorry, it's news to me.

17
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,450
We were wondering,
would your family

18
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,019
be interested in joining us?

19
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,954
When would you need
an answer by?

20
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:55,722
Oh, the sooner the better.

21
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,526
Costa Rica!

22
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,395
Costa Rica!

23
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:03,764
Time to rock and...

24
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,798
Costa Rica!

25
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,001
Costa Rica! Costa Rica!

26
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,002
Costa Rica...!

27
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,671
Costa Rica.

28
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,172
Family meeting!

29
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,041
Right now!

30
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:19,980
The Van Houtens invited us

31
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,983
on their super-exclusive
multi-family vacation

32
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,818
to Costa Rica!

33
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:27,854
We'll stay in a luxury villa
right on the beach...

34
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,058
near pristine rain forests,

35
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:34,127
home to five percent
of the species on earth.

36
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:35,963
Biodiversity!

37
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,866
In a land where it's normal
for kids to carry machetes.

38
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,168
Legalize it!

39
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,071
And you can chew
on the guidebook.

40
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,907
I've always dreamed
of being the kind of family

41
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:50,010
that other families would be
willing to do things with.

42
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:52,079
Costa Rica!

43
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,214
- Costa Rica!
- Airport food court!

44
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,750
- Airport food court!
- Costa Rica!

45
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:05,125
Now, that's a tympanic membrane
that just won't quit.

46
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,129
This trip's gonna cost how much?

47
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:10,697
I know it's expensive,

48
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:13,467
but we spend our whole lives
worrying about money.

49
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,869
That's because we
don't have that much.

50
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,038
We have a mortgage,
a reverse mortgage.

51
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,407
I think the house is owned
by the car.

52
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,909
Life is about experiences.

53
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,146
Look at this photo the Hibberts
posted from last year's trip.

54
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:28,148
Now look at my feed.

55
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:29,916
Yeah.

56
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:30,951
Oh, boy.

57
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:34,688
I want a photo of you and me
by that waterfall.

58
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,924
The hope of going on this trip
is the only reason

59
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,094
I've allowed Bart
to stay friends with Milhouse.

60
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,097
Now I understand everything.

61
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,099
Homie, I know it's a stretch,

62
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,602
but if Kirk and Luann
can afford it...

63
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,771
Yeah. He can't earn that much.

64
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,140
His job is moving
the Topless Maids van

65
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,941
so they don't get
parking tickets.

66
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,945
Let's have one damn fling and
hope everything will be okay.

67
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,981
You know what?
You are right.

68
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:03,016
I am sick of being
the responsible one

69
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,518
in this marriage.

70
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,053
Let's live life.

71
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,921
Remember, we can never be poor

72
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:10,457
as long as we have each other.

73
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,194
Oh, yes, we can.

74
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,766
You know, what if we stayed home

75
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,802
and just did puzzles
of Costa Rica?

76
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,405
I mean, this trip sounds
really expensive.

77
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,774
- No, not really.
- What? No!

78
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:32,045
You just let the grown-ups worry
about grown-up things, okay?

79
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,980
Your mom and dad

80
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,651
have our financial future
all under control.

81
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,354
Free ticket!

82
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,156
The rich get richer!

83
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,528
Ah, the multi-family vacation.

84
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:49,996
Let's see who we've got.

85
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,032
The Van Houtens, of course.
The Hibberts.

86
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,868
Superintendent Chalmers
and his daughter.

87
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,003
I can't believe
my father is tearing us apart

88
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,872
for a whole week.

89
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,540
Sweetie,
it's a very long flight.

90
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,442
Why don't you save
your phone battery.

91
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,611
All you care about is batteries!

92
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,613
You've never been in love.

93
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,648
Your mother and I had a very...

94
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,650
Never mind.

95
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,185
Yep, not one person here

96
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,255
I'd mind spending
an extended period of time with.

97
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:18,925
I didn't have time to wax,
so I'll do it on the plane.

98
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,863
What the hell
is that doing here?

99
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,432
Well, Lou the cop and his sister
were gonna go,

100
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,033
but a billboard fell on him

101
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,603
and her wind chime store
burned down.

102
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,639
So I suggested Patty
and her new girlfriend.

103
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,441
You deliberately hid this
from me

104
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,476
until it was too late
to back out.

105
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,612
- Yes.
- Don't try to deny it.

106
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:43,416
Patty's new relationship
really has to work out,

107
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,219
because the dating apps
won't take her anymore.

108
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,222
All I ask is that
you're nice to them.

109
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,525
Evelyn, this is
my husband Homer.

110
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,860
A very polite hello
to you, madam.

111
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,929
Well, well, Homer Simpson.

112
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,931
I've heard so much about you.

113
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,933
Surely you have,
but in my defense,

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,036
urinating on a privately owned
merry-go-round

115
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,006
is not public urination.

116
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:24,925
Okay, who wants Miguelitos?

117
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,560
Now, I should warn the newbies.

118
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,196
These will seem
very authentic to you.

119
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,999
This stuff is pura vida
in a glass.

120
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,334
What's pura vida?

121
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,706
It means pure life.

122
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,942
Kind of a state of mind
down here.

123
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,043
Very chill.

124
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,911
Like what you think of as chill

125
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,614
but, like,
a million times chiller.

126
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,950
Homie, I think
I'm having an experience.

127
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:54,855
Every time a fruit meets a
booze, a magic vacation is born.

128
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,838
Well, you can try.

129
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,909
Oh, boy, I didn't know that.

130
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,081
So true.

131
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,785
Rodrigo, Rodrigo, mi hermano,

132
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,988
put the bill on this.

133
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,424
Nothing is less pura vida
than check-splitting.

134
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,427
On this trip
I pay for everything up front.

135
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,396
Food, the villa rental,

136
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,632
cloud forest murder mystery...

137
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,934
and I keep track of 'em
right here.

138
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,403
Then we settle up at the end.

139
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,438
Smokey Blandings is putting on

140
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,841
a cornhole clinic tonight.

141
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,977
And this is where fatigue
really sets in, Jim.

142
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:53,013
When you're tossing
that fourth beanbag,

143
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,148
your muscles
are screaming, son.

144
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,884
- Booyah!
- Good heavenly days!

145
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,489
You also follow
the pro cornhole tour?

146
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:05,258
Sure do. I used to play
on my daddy's farm.

147
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,060
We'd toss bags all day,

148
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,996
even when it was hotter
than a two-dollar pistol.

149
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,066
That is hot.

150
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:16,169
Do you always speak
in such colorful Southern-isms?

151
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:20,507
Does a mama possum
skip church on Sundays?

152
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,511
I bet she does.

153
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,847
Homer, put your phone away.

154
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,716
Evelyn, please.

155
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,122
Evelyn, you don't want
to go shopping with us?

156
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,058
It's a vacation, sugar bear.

157
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,661
We should be lying on the beach
like a lost flip-flop.

158
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:46,666
But, darling, there's nothing
to do at the beach except drink.

159
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,903
You know what? Why don't
you two take in the sights

160
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,073
while I chaperone your
Southern señorita to the beach?

161
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,077
Well, my, my,
what an elegant solution.

162
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,379
Well, I guess this way
everyone's happy.

163
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,989
Tonight's dinner
is amazing, folks.

164
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,324
Line-caught mahi mahi.

165
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:14,694
The local fishermen pass the
lines down from father to son,

166
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,030
so, boy,
you can taste the heritage.

167
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,399
Dios mío!

168
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,001
Eh, what?

169
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,535
Hey, guys.

170
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,005
We met these awesome monkeys
on the beach,

171
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,906
and we said
they could crash here

172
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,609
in exchange
for them being hilarious.

173
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,882
Sweetie, you did not tell me

174
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,418
your brother-in-law was
such a fun guy.

175
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:41,287
You two should be so happy.

176
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,923
Your husband and your girlfriend

177
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,292
are amigos!

178
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,863
Who's that with you, Jimbo?

179
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,631
Is that Stacy?

180
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,099
Oh, my God.

181
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,568
Jimbo is cheating on me!

182
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,410
Okay, makeup kit, selfie stick.

183
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,012
Oh, God, where's
the selfie stick charger?

184
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,213
Honey, relax.

185
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,083
The waterfall picture's
going to be fine.

186
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,385
Fine? If this photo
is just fine,

187
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,087
we're getting a divorce.

188
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,589
Okay, okay,
that crossed the line,

189
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,958
but this is
a once-in-a-lifetime trip

190
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:22,562
and our only shot
at a perfect moment.

191
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:26,466
I get it, you're mad
about my awesome monkey party.

192
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,701
But you wanted me to be nice
to Patty's girlfriend,

193
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:29,869
and guess what.

194
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,137
She's cool.

195
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,907
Just what you need,
another drinking buddy.

196
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,976
Just promise me you'll behave
for the rest of the trip.

197
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,079
Okay, okay.
I will stay far away

198
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,314
from Patty's
fun Southern girlfriend.

199
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,116
Or as she would say,

200
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,251
further away
than a fat-cheeked boy

201
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,921
from a porch full of grannies.

202
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,691
Run, fat boy, run!

203
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,332
Why are you freaking out?

204
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,667
Shouldn't you be in the jungle

205
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,702
kissing a boa constrictor
or something?

206
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,371
This trip is so expensive,
and Mom and Dad don't care,

207
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,807
so I'm practicing sleeping
in a car

208
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:10,877
for when we lose the house
and have to sleep in our car!

209
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,012
Well, Milhouse's dad writes down
how much money everyone owes

210
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,982
in that book,
so all we have to do is snag it,

211
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,717
then show Mom and Dad
the numbers.

212
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:21,287
Yes! That'll snap 'em
out of their financial insanity.

213
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,724
You up for a little
breaking and entering?

214
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,993
Break into a grown-up's bedroom?

215
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,895
Whoa, big move.

216
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,364
Okay, we'll do it
when everyone's on the hike.

217
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,700
But how do we get rid
of Milhouse?

218
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,935
Not a problem.
Milhouse already ditched me

219
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,237
for Dr. Hibbert's kid.

220
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,939
His vacation friend.

221
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,243
Hey, JJ, do you still
like Legos?

222
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,879
- Not really.
- Me neither.

223
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,648
Lego sucks!

224
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:52,585
Hey, JJ, why don't we put on a
play for the grown-ups tonight?

225
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,156
Ooh, sweetie, look,
a Flowers of Costa Rica

226
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,759
scavenger hunt. I wonder
how many we can find together?

227
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,828
Just braid, Daddy!

228
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:04,931
I need to look super hot
to win back Jimbo's heart.

229
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,900
Darling, you're experiencing

230
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,335
so many emotions
for the first time.

231
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,271
And that's very healthy, but...

232
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,140
He strayed because of you!

233
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,978
Hey, JJ, one time my friend got
a temporary tattoo

234
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,981
but told his dad it was real.

235
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,317
Okay, let's steal that ledger.

236
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:25,652
What's that thing?

237
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,820
Grappling hook made
of Patty's underwire bra

238
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,622
and Dad's
bathing suit drawstring.

239
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,057
Will it reach?

240
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:44,237
This is so weird, being in
another grown-up's bedroom.

241
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:48,641
Boy, you're telling me.
He doesn't even work out.

242
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,478
I don't want to learn
anything else about this family.

243
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,980
It's too late.

244
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,452
All right, bottled water break.

245
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,087
I can drink from the stream.

246
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:05,225
After all these years,
my gut biome is simpatico

247
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,026
with the local bacteria.

248
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:13,333
Oh, God, there's something
moving inside me!

249
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,602
Oh, look out!
Oh, look out!

250
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,937
Look out, I said look out!
Look out!

251
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:22,475
Oh, God, no simpatico!
No simpatico!

252
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:25,712
Hey, Homer.
You want a hit off this?

253
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:29,649
Oh, Evelyn. You and I both love
secret day drinking,

254
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,951
but I promised Marge
I'd have a bad time

255
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,453
the rest of this vacation.

256
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,523
I hear exactly
what you're saying.

257
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,398
Did you find the ledger?

258
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,635
No, but take a look at this.

259
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,703
These are stone spheres

260
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,240
made by the extinct
Diquis people of Costa Rica.

261
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:58,111
No one knows what they were for,
but they're priceless artifacts.

262
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,547
So what is Milhouse's
loser dad doing with them?

263
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,887
Oh, I'm sorry, Kirk's tum-tum.

264
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,690
Daddy drank some ick-ick.

265
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,060
Oh, the rumblies are coming.

266
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,062
The rumblies are coming!

267
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,364
They're here!

268
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,468
If we get this photo right,

269
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,872
this multi-family vacation
will be worth every penny.

270
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,909
You're so cute
when you're super controlling.

271
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,179
You've been drinking.

272
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,181
Well, maybe Evelyn added

273
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,917
a little Southern charm
to my water.

274
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,953
That woman!
She brings out the worst in you!

275
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,922
Look!

276
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,190
Oh, my God.

277
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:45,725
It's perfect.

278
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,593
You look good,
and I look better.

279
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,362
Post it. Post it.

280
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,197
Homer!

281
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:55,134
Buddy, hi. Watch me do
a Savannah Polecat Flip.

282
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,106
No!

283
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,875
Come back, camera fish!

284
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:17,090
All I wanted was for my friends
to be jealous of me.

285
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,025
I hope you're happy

286
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,861
now that that bald gorilla
has dragged my girlfriend down

287
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:24,564
to his pathetic level.

288
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,569
Patricia Maleficent Bouvier,

289
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,238
I've put up with you criticizing
my husband for years,

290
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:33,806
and I've had it.

291
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,375
Evelyn got Homer drunk.

292
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,443
Evelyn ruined my dream photo.

293
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,278
She's the bad influence.

294
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,080
That's ridiculous.

295
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:44,016
She may be Southern,
she may be a woman,

296
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,619
but you're dating a Homer.

297
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,024
Oh, no.

298
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,361
Mom, look what I found
in the Van Houtens' room!

299
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:59,332
They are smuggling
these artifacts home to sell!

300
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,435
That's how they can afford
this vacation.

301
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,070
But we can't.

302
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,072
And we're gonna have
to live in our car,

303
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,074
and the seats
in our car are sticky,

304
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,109
even though they're cloth!

305
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:13,246
You're... You're so gross.

306
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,248
It's so gross.

307
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,984
Salt and pepper.

308
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,086
These souvenirs
were supposed to be

309
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:23,256
our end-of-multi-family-vacation
gift to you all.

310
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,391
Way to spoil the surprise.

311
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,761
Not very pura vida.

312
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,130
Not very pura vida at all.

313
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,700
Stacy and I are finished.

314
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,869
Shauna Chalmers,
will you marry me?

315
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,838
Oh, my God!

316
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,306
Jimbo proposed!

317
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,743
We are getting freaking married!

318
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,151
Oh, you guys
are slinking off early.

319
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:55,755
Don't you want to come ziplining
and ruin the trip some more?

320
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,490
Well, I would...

321
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:00,660
like to agree with my wife
that it's better we leave.

322
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,362
I'll give you the final bill now
so we can settle up.

323
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,865
No discount for leaving early
either.

324
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:10,403
I may be mucho pura vida,
but I'm not a sucker.

325
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,673
Lisa was right.

326
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,842
We really couldn't afford
this trip.

327
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,682
Ooh, that's a big number.

328
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,261
How's Patty?
I haven't seen her.

329
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,029
I don't know what happened.

330
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,165
She broke up with me.

331
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,402
I know you feel bad, Mom,

332
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,671
but the lady is a Homer.

333
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,112
Oh, all that money,

334
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,114
and we didn't even get
the picture.

335
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,149
Look at this.

336
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,318
Mr. Van Houten even charged us

337
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,988
for those salt
and pepper shakers.

338
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,656
He said those were a gift.

339
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,658
And he didn't even
give them to us.

340
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,160
Then we're not leaving
without them.

341
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:21,474
Oh, so that explains it.

342
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:26,979
Gotcha.

343
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,916
Can't you let us even zipline
in peace?

344
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:33,119
Look what we found hidden
in your bedroom.

345
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:37,089
This is a portrait of explorer
Kirkedemious Van Houten,

346
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:40,593
who settled this area for
a Dutch cracker-trading company,

347
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,231
and he built this house,
which your family still owns.

348
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,900
You're charging us thousands
of dollars in rent

349
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,802
for a house you get for free.

350
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,004
The Van Houtens
are cheating all of us,

351
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,007
so we pay for their vacation.

352
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,510
- I'm stunned.
- I'm shocked.

353
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,011
I'm Shauna.

354
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,981
I'm just as surprised
as any of you.

355
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,083
Oh, what?!
Come on!

356
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,118
This scam was her idea.

357
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:09,055
And this year
she even charged you more

358
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,457
so we could pay
for our intimacy coach.

359
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:14,327
I mean, how many things
can you do with a feather?

360
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,430
Oh, easy, guys, easy.

361
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:21,067
Everyone try
to remain pura vida. Huh?

362
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,002
I'm gonna pura vida
my foot in your ass

363
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,971
if you don't
give me back my money.

364
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,873
He's zipping away!

365
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,010
Stop him
before he endorses those checks!

366
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,880
So, you and Evelyn broke up?

367
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,716
I thought you really liked her.

368
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,353
I did, but now all I see
is Homer, thanks to you.

369
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,055
Patty! Come back!

370
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,959
I can't!
Because I'm on a zipline...

371
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:53,065
Patty, I'm sorry I upset you,
but Evelyn is your Homer,

372
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,068
and no one else will ever
understand why you love her,

373
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,536
except for you.

374
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,272
But there's one huge difference
between them.

375
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:06,879
I'm listening.

376
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,881
Evelyn loves you,

377
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:12,618
and Homer hates you
more than anything in the world.

378
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,320
Even more than he hates Selma?

379
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:15,988
He feels sorry for Selma,

380
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:18,324
because she has to live
with you.

381
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:19,992
Hold on, Evelyn!

382
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,595
I'm coming!

383
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:25,498
Go ahead, take your money.

384
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,800
Take away a man's
only source of income.

385
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,902
No, it's real classy.

386
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,304
We just got a free vacation.

387
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,376
Now let's charter a helicopter
back to the waterfall

388
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:40,179
to get your mom's
precious picture.

389
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,550
No, no, no. It's okay.

390
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:47,086
Vacations aren't
about the perfect photo.

391
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:50,923
It's about being in the moment
and living your vida.

392
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,363
They're as cute
as two bugs in a rug.

393
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,811
Honey, I just want you to know

394
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,913
that Jimbo Jones is
a fine young man,

395
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,348
and I'm very happy
for you two to be married.

396
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,584
- Truly.
- Yeah...

397
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:21,353
Jimbo's parents freaked out
and canceled the wedding.

398
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,089
Whatever.

399
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,824
I'm glad
somebody's setting limits.

400
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,325
You know, pumpkin,
I'm doing my best.

401
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,827
Do you understand that?

402
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,596
That as a single father,
it's not always so easy

403
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:33,432
to balance guidance
with respect for your...

404
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:37,103
Yeah...

405
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:41,907
Yeah, now
we're connecting, huh?

406
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:52,000
Why can't we just leave?

407
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,420
'Cause we have to clean up
before Uncle Pete gets here,

408
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,722
or we'll lose our week
next year.

409
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:05,131
Hey, hey,
this stuff is expensive!

410
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,166
¿Comprende?

411
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:14,373
No, amigos, no, no.

412
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,474
No, pura vida!

413
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,475
Pura vida!

414
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:19,478
Oh, no! No bueno!
