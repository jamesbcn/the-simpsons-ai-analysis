1
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:10,777
D'oh!

2
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,026
NARRA TOR: For centuries,

3
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:29,062
man has been ruled
by science and industry.

4
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:32,137
But that era is drawing to a close.

5
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,240
We stand on the cusp of a new epoch,

6
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,175
one of prophecy, puzzles...

7
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,315
...and signs in the sky.

8
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,911
And that epoch begins today.

9
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,420
Our top story,
today Springfield will experience...

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,588
...a rare total eclipse of the sun.

11
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:58,692
A solar eclipse is like a woman
breastfeeding in a restaurant.

12
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:02,262
It's free, it's beautiful, but under
no circumstances should you look at it.

13
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,198
We recommend using
a homemade camera obscura...

14
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:08,401
...fashioned from an ordinary shoebox
and paper towel tube.

15
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:12,939
This was supposed to be pre-made.
Fine, I'll do it myself!

16
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,941
Where's the end of the frigging tape?

17
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,376
Forget it! We'll do it next week!

18
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:17,477
PRODUCER: The eclipse is today.

19
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:21,657
There's an eclipse
when I say there's an eclipse!

20
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,515
Okay, people, we've hit penumbra.

21
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,684
Brace yourselves for umbra.

22
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,420
I'm gonna see it first.
- No! I'm gonna see it first.

23
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,555
Hit the road, you big load!

24
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,624
My space toy!

25
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,430
It's okay, Homie. You can have my viewer.

26
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,298
But, Mom, you'll miss the eclipse.

27
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:16,308
There'll be another one
in North Yemen in 2027.

28
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,833
We have totality, people.

29
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,341
BART, HOMER AND LISA: Wow!

30
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,944
We'll be talking about this
together for years.

31
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,546
BART: For years!
LISA: For years!

32
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,282
HOMER: I finally feel
like part of a family.

33
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:32,419
Oh! I can't miss out.
Just one little peek.

34
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,853
It's beautiful.

35
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:44,731
Now, Marge, your eyes must stay
completely covered for two full weeks.

36
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,734
Don't worry, honey.
I'll be your seeing-eye Homer.

37
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,770
We're in some kind of doctor room.
Bunch of stuff on the walls.

38
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,941
It's kind of hard to describe.
I'm gonna take my break now.

39
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,278
Now, Simpsons, I must warn you,
any stress could increase...

40
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,614
...the blood pressure in Marge's eyeballs,
leading to what we call

41
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,714
Tex Avery Syndrome.

42
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,362
Wolves are taking all our women.

43
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,102
You guys have treated me like a princess.

44
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,338
Every day's been like
the first 10 minutes of Mother's Day.

45
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,675
You just rest those rods
and coddle those cones.

46
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,311
Everything's taken care of.
- Aw...

47
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,079
Dad, come in the kitchen, quick!

48
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,648
Is there any other way to enter a kitchen?

49
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,362
Aw... Rats in the kitchen,

50
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,624
just like that delightful movie
I taped in the theater.

51
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,727
Ooh!

52
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,597
He's controlling me with my hair,

53
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:54,801
using me to cook a delicious
sole meuniére with a celery root purée...

54
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,901
...and carrots Vichy.

55
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,241
Mmm. This is good.

56
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,714
Good but not great.
I'll go get some rat poison.

57
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,815
There you go. This'll
kill those dirty rats...

58
00:04:16,915 --> 00:04:18,158
...and the clean ones, too.

59
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,261
That's not candy, sweetheart.

60
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:24,397
What is it with kids
and candy-colored poison, huh?

61
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,571
No, you stupid dog!
That's Maggie's bunny!

62
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,540
Not in front of the poison man!

63
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,775
Whoever is biting me, stop it!

64
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:44,606
Why did I bring the baby
and the dog to the poison store?

65
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:51,348
Oh, how am I gonna get us all
across this river?

66
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,791
A boat!

67
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,597
We're too heavy.

68
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,572
Let's see. I need to
get the baby, the dog,

69
00:05:02,672 --> 00:05:04,103
and the poison across the river,

70
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:06,372
but I can only take one thing at a time.

71
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,675
I can't leave the baby
alone with the poison.

72
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,945
And I can't leave the dog
alone with the baby.

73
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,881
Can't someone help me with this puzzle?

74
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,600
Professor Frink, help me figure this out!

75
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,086
Yo! Over here!

76
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,058
What?

77
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,808
Great time to nap, Einstein!

78
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:40,073
Okay. Maggie, dog, poison,
you're all involved, so listen up.

79
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,842
First, I row Maggie over,
leaving the dog and the poison.

80
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,078
Then I row back alone,
take the poison over...

81
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,914
...and bring Maggie back.
Then I take the dog over, come back,

82
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:53,284
get Maggie, row across,
and before I know it, I'm back at home.

83
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,125
Were you listening at all?

84
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,997
CLETUS: Sir?

85
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,833
I'd be obliged to you
if you'd help me puzzle out...

86
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,435
...my fox, duck and corn situation.

87
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,522
Well, the puzzle done puzzled itself out.

88
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,612
Now I need to leave you
where you'll be safe,

89
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,881
under the watchful eyes of God.

90
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,984
And I'll be watching you, too,
in case God's busy making tornadoes...

91
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,219
...or not existing.

92
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,987
I see you!

93
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,087
I see you!

94
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:35,449
Look at that.
One of God's discarded miracles.

95
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,763
Catholics!

96
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,358
Give me my baby back!

97
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,937
Sir, our mission is quite clear.

98
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,345
Why would you leave
such a beautiful baby on our doorstep?

99
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,648
Because she was fighting my dog
and stealing my poison.

100
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:59,085
Now give her back so I can
take her home to my rat-infested house.

101
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:02,055
No.
The poor dear is right where she belongs.

102
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,090
Come on, lady. Have a heart!

103
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,427
I'm sure your husband
does stupid things sometimes.

104
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,263
I'm married to Jesus!
- Yeah, right.

105
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,498
And I'm married to Wonder Woman.

106
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,136
Kids, I have to tell
your mom I lost Maggie.

107
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,405
But Dr. Hibbert said
not to stress her out.

108
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,074
Wait! I have an idea.

109
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:25,378
One of us can go undercover as a nun
and infiltrate the convent.

110
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,811
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no!

111
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:34,787
There is no way Homer Simpson's gonna
put on a dress and act like a nun.

112
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,522
Told you there was no way I would do it.

113
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,425
Are you sure you don't want me to do it?
Because I can do it!

114
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,160
I got the outfit right here. Huh?

115
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,963
Dad, leave, so I can get into character.

116
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,635
Mmm-hmm.

117
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,605
Hello.

118
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:55,508
I'm a poor little sinner
who's lost her way.

119
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,009
May I join your order?

120
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,312
How do you feel about kneeling?
- Can't get enough.

121
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,412
You're in.

122
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:04,751
Finally, you must wear your habit
modestly at all times,

123
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,386
not like Sister Marilyn.

124
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,287
Ooh!

125
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,387
The nursery!

126
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,127
If you're happy and you know it
That's a sin

127
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,029
If you're happy and you know it
That's a sin

128
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,698
Where's Maggie?

129
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:22,301
Mother Superior, are those
all the babies in our orphanage?

130
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,303
Looking for more unwanted babies,
are you?

131
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,539
Well, next week's nine months
after the prom.

132
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,274
They'll be stacked up to the ceiling.

133
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,710
No. I was just thinking you might
have some in the back...

134
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,878
...you haven't put out yet.

135
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,746
Oh, a doubting Thomas, are you?

136
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,715
Well, more of a Curious George.

137
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:36,816
Well, little monkey,

138
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:41,053
it's time for you to spend some time
with the Man in the Yellow Hat.

139
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:44,857
Why would Mother Superior lie to me
about not having Maggie?

140
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,957
What is going on?

141
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,659
A jewel. Why would nuns want a jewel?

142
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:56,290
Find the jewel, find what you desire.

143
00:08:56,736 --> 00:09:00,239
The jewel will lead me to my baby sister?
Why are you telling me this?

144
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,708
Because I'm sick of that Mother Superior.

145
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:07,228
Whenever we play football,
she has to be quarterback.

146
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:16,286
Now you must solve a series of clues.

147
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,859
You mean an increasingly difficult
series of challenges to my intellect?

148
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,360
That's so cool.

149
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,062
Plus, you find your sister.
- Oh, sure.

150
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,162
Your first clue.

151
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,470
And before you decide to become a nun,
consider this.

152
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,205
I am only 23.

153
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,977
Hmm.

154
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:44,750
That's Latin.''Deum ''is God.
And of course ''quaerite''means seek.

155
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,785
'Seek God with heart and soul.'

156
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,290
Heart and Soul!

157
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:59,526
I fell in love with you Heart and soul

158
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:44,310
Homie, I haven't held Maggie all day.
Can you hand her to me?

159
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,410
No problem, sweetie.

160
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:52,364
Ooh! Mommy's little baby is getting
big and chubby.

161
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,618
Who's a chubby baby?

162
00:10:55,388 --> 00:11:00,233
But that doesn't mean
that you can't have a little dinner.

163
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:03,352
Hmm. You're not usually this greedy.

164
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,899
Cool it.
She's getting suspicious.

165
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,999
You cool it!
I'm hungry!

166
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:20,179
Cryptic message.
Maybe this will lead me to the gem.

167
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,316
Hmm. What if I read every other word?

168
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:33,426
That's not very nice. I will try again
but not because the wall told me to.

169
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,234
Big ring.

170
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,334
Big ring.

171
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,578
So many rings.

172
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:56,333
But which one is the key
to finding the gem?

173
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,823
Well, did you get it?

174
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:07,833
No. I'm not a smart nerd.
I'm just a weak nerd.

175
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,997
The biggest ring in Springfield...

176
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:14,667
...comes from the bell
in the Springfield bell tower!

177
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,767
Oh.

178
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,303
Oh!

179
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,277
Good night, Bart.

180
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,377
I'll be right in, Lisa!

181
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,357
Good night, Lisa.

182
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,026
Good night.

183
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,864
Ooh! Jazz.

184
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,836
Keep going and I'll scat.

185
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,085
Principal Skinner? Comic Book Guy?

186
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,453
What are you doing here?

187
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,289
Following you.
We seek the gem of St. Teresa.

188
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,315
Oh. Well, I seek it so
I can find my sister.

189
00:13:13,415 --> 00:13:15,394
How do you know about the gem?

190
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,997
We are an ancient order
of mystery buffs...

191
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:22,635
...who hide in shadow and call ourselves
The Brethren of the Quest.

192
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,404
Because we do our sleuthing
in Mother's Nissan Quest minivan.

193
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,940
Tell me all you know about the gem.
- Never!

194
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,543
Does your mother know
you're using her minivan?

195
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,779
You see, legend has it that
on her deathbed, St. Teresa of Avila...

196
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:38,484
...had a vision of a jewel that would
usher in an era of peace and harmony.

197
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,087
She dispatched a team of nuns
to the New World...

198
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,652
...to seek this fabulous gem.

199
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,103
They landed at what is now Philadelphia,

200
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:03,315
And used the timbers of their ship
to construct a convent.

201
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:11,117
The order flourished,
never forgetting its sacred mission.

202
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,852
But word about the gem got out,

203
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:17,790
and a group of high-ranking Freemasons
led by Benjamin Franklin,

204
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,361
George Washington, and King George III
staged a phony war of independence...

205
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,606
...to cover their search for the gem.

206
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:36,741
Fleeing the violence,

207
00:14:36,841 --> 00:14:39,011
the nuns of St. Teresa
's left the colonies...

208
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,947
...and settled here in Springfield.

209
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,883
Legend and Wikipedia have it...

210
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:48,420
...that the gem will be revealed during
the first full moon after a solar eclipse.

211
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,522
That's tonight!

212
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,625
One question remains.

213
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,725
Why did you come here?

214
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:59,331
Because I cleverly deduced the answer
to Springfield's biggest ring.

215
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:06,003
Well, it gives me no pleasure to say
your deduction was faulty!

216
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,076
This is a fake, papier-mâché bell.

217
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,546
The real bell was melted down
in World War II...

218
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,381
...to make Civil War chess sets,

219
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,481
four of which I own.

220
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,951
Oh, my God!

221
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,987
I know what the biggest ring
in Springfield is!

222
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,723
It's been right in front of us
the whole time.

223
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:29,838
Ah. Ah, yes. I see it.
- I see it, too. Let's head that way.

224
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:33,635
We'll walk or drive to
the obvious solution.

225
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,372
Oh, the word 'ring'!

226
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:51,917
Well, well, if it isn't the Tardy Boys
and Nancy Clueless.

227
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,720
Mr. Burns? What are you doing here?

228
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,755
I've known about the gem for years.

229
00:15:56,855 --> 00:16:00,593
You see, my dear girl, I joined
the Freemasons before it was trendy.

230
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:04,163
That's my eyeball on the dollar bill.
That's also my pyramid.

231
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:08,234
Hence, I trailed you on your quest,
accompanied by my faithful albino.

232
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:13,005
I keep telling you, I'm not an albino!
I just use a lot of sun block.

233
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:16,542
Then why do I give you
all the albino holidays off? Hmm? Hmm?

234
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,711
Look! There's writing on the 'R.'

235
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,813
Everything is writing to you young people.

236
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,215
From this angle they're words.

237
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,590
Great crimes kill holy sage?

238
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,827
The puzzle is solved.
We must warn the holy sage at once!

239
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,328
No! That's not it.

240
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:40,366
A secret message this awkwardly
worded is always an anagram.

241
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:44,970
Fine. Then you unscramble those letters
to spell out the location of the gem...

242
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,215
...while you two dig your own graves.

243
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:55,047
Superman, I have believed in you
for years.

244
00:16:55,147 --> 00:17:00,587
If you can hear me now,
please come help me dig this giant grave.

245
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,260
So the anagram spells...

246
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,995
So the gem is inside you?

247
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,172
Sir, stop. She is the gem.

248
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:23,842
Of course. St. Teresa wouldn't
be interested in a mere bauble.

249
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,412
Her greatest treasure would be
a pure young girl.

250
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,247
You are pure, aren't you?

251
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,715
Does kissing Milhouse count?
- No.

252
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,283
No.
- No.

253
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:35,387
It all adds up.
I am the gem that will bring world peace.

254
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:40,192
How brilliant of God to remove my
skepticism by making me his chosen one!

255
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:44,496
According to legend, the gem must be
brought to the convent by sunrise.

256
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:47,566
We could make it if we took
Mr. Burns' helicopter.

257
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,687
Hmm. I don't really
want you people inside.

258
00:17:49,787 --> 00:17:51,470
But you could dangle from the skids.

259
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,238
Deal.

260
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,307
It feels good to help someone,
doesn't it, sir?

261
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,739
No. It feels weird.

262
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,185
Look who's here!

263
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,830
Fine, fine. Finish your song.
I can be patient.

264
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,900
After all, I am the Gem Child.
- Hush, you foolish girl!

265
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The gem is over there.

266
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,607
Maggie? No, no, no. The solution was,

267
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,076
'Regally, the rock gem is Lisa.'

268
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:35,814
Oh, please. How many sentences start
with the word 'regally'?

269
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:36,949
This one.

270
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,049
Oh, give me that!

271
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:45,466
LISA: 'It's really Maggie, Sherlock.'

272
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,626
You know, I have to point out that this
only makes sense,

273
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,695
if I get the wrong answer first.

274
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,795
I said hush!

275
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:59,499
Now begins a new era
of peace and prosperity for Springfield.

276
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,656
Come on, man!
That's the fifth call you've missed today!

277
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,051
That's it! You're out of...

278
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,196
Just set it to massage.

279
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:34,907
Something tells me the Gem of St. Teresa
has been returned to its throne.

280
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:40,306
Maggie, it's true! You are the Gem Child!

281
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:44,516
Four centuries of patient sacrifice
has finally paid off.

282
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,846
All is peace and harmony.

283
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,952
Give me my baby back!

284
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,457
Mom, how did you know Maggie was here?

285
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,225
A mother knows!

286
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,697
Maggie, you're coming home with me.

287
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:03,302
Mom, wait! Maggie is the Gem Child!
She's brought peace to our town...

288
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,938
...and reports of less road rage
in Shelbyville.

289
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,840
She has to stay here.

290
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:13,720
Well, it would be nice if the first thing
I saw was a world at peace.

291
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:23,188
You're even more beautiful
than I remembered.

292
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,289
I'm sorry.

293
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:28,694
But I know God would never ask
a mother to sacrifice her child...

294
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,230
...for the good of the world...

295
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,330
...again.

296
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,337
Maybe I'm just being
selfish. I don't know.

297
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:41,507
No, Marge.
You're the most giving person I know.

298
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:46,912
Besides, I gave them another Gem Child
to sit on their precious throne.

299
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,667
Step aside, ladies.
I'm bringing the peace.

300
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,604
I am so staying up past my bedtime.

301
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,384
