00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,582
Everything here
is made out of garbage.

3
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:15,118
Upcycling is at the very core
of the modern maker movement.

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,945
It's very responsible.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,420
Like these doggie chew toys
made out of...

6
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,089
used retainers?

7
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:23,058
Ugh! Too responsible!

00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,191
Hey, guys.
You're craft fair fans, too?

10
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:30,004
Ew, no. We're doing
a photo scavenger hunt

11
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:31,797
for Francine's birthday party.

12
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,828
We need a picture
of something sad.

13
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,774
I wonder why I wasn't invited.

14
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:39,869
'Cause you're a party narc
who ruins everybody's fun.

15
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,543
What?
When have I ever done that?

16
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,313
You once deflated a bouncy house
'cause you smelled mildew.

17
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,452
You shut down a pool party

18
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,246
'cause the diving board
wasn't code.

19
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,478
You stopped a barbecue

20
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,893
because the fire extinguishers
were expired.

21
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,745
Okay, okay, I get it.

22
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,624
Basically, you're a wet blanket.

23
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,762
That's not true,
she's more like a blanket

24
00:00:57,758 --> 00:01:00,628
that tattles and kills all joy.

25
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,327
Ooh, that's sad.

26
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,459
(laughs)

27
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,203

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,099
Oh, what a beautiful little box.

29
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,541
I'll take this.

30
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,096
You'll need this polish.

31
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:13,274
It's my blend
of secret ingredients,

32
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:16,983
including carnauba wax.
That-that one's not a secret.

33
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,707
Okay, I'll take both.

34
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,052
I have to explain to the box

35
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:21,817
that it's going
to live with you now.

36
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,745
Okay, baby, you're gonna go...

37
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,020
Are you
seeing this?

38
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,019
Are you seeing that?

39
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,691
(chuckles) Man bun.

40
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,331
Pathetic old dude
thinks death won't find him

41
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,497
if he has a freaky hair lump.

42
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,395
(chuckles) Stupid bun.

00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,037
Homer, Marge!

45
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,905
You finally get
to meet my special lady.

46
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,735
This is Blythe.

47
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,380
Special lady? Since when?

48
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:53,146
Oh. Oh, it's been
almost six months.

49
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,046
And we're just
hearing about it now?

50
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,318
What do you mean?
I left you tons of messages.

51
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,488
I thought those were
all butt-dials.

52

58
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,743
I was hired by

<i>to cleanse auras with

00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,946
We're not wasting
any more time.

74
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,906
I'm moving in with her.

75
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:04,054
I finally found true love.

76
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,391
And I finally won't have to pay

77
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,916
for your retirement home.
(cries happily)

78
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,493
(chimes ringing)

79
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,862
You have so many chimes.

80
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,062
You're not going
to miss any wind.

81
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,334
Ooh, this is my son Calvin.

82
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,503
Felicitous greetings
on this day to you.

83
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,442
That's how this one guy talked
in <i>Star Trek</i>

84
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,007
when they went
to a Shakespeare planet.

85
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,705
It's how I'm saying hello
these days.

86
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,377
Oh, uh, hello-eth to you.

87
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,106
What a charmer.

88
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,451
- How old is Calvin?
- 11.

89
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,717
Hmm, so you had him
when you were...

90
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,086
Oh, he's adopted.

91
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:42,385
Cute kid, but, man,
my dad's gonna eat him alive.

92
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,931
Hey, there's my guy.

93
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,227
Wha?

94
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,228
Uppies!

95
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,602
(gasps)

96
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,840
He never gave me uppies.

97
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,966
(groaning)

98
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,883
Abe and Calvin
love to cook for company.

99
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,607
Final looks on
the plating, chef.

100
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,782
That one needs a sweep
of balsamic, chef.

101
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:11,222
Nobody's refilled
my water glass.

102
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:13,988
This restaurant
would get zero Michelin tires.

103
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,657
Tonight we've made for you
a roasted chicken

104
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,187
with apricot and fennel.

105
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:20,732
- MARGE: Mmm.
- How are we enjoying
the first bites?

106
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,197
Hmm...

107
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:25,166
Well, I'm not
getting fennel at all.

108
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:26,725
So that's a fail.

109
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,043
(whispering):
Don't be rude.

110
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,565
(shrieks) Shelf rat!

111
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,010
Well, they're both rodents,
but this little dude

112
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,376
is a Sciuridae, or squirrel,
if you prefer.

113
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:39,006
I'd prefer that it not
stare into my soul

114
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,452
like it knows my sins.

115
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:44,277
Calvin does taxidermy.
That's one of his pieces.

116
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,764
He's a rising star in the field.
He takes classes with adults.

117
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,385
You can't even see
the tire tracks

118
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,290
- on this guy anymore.
- (alarm beeps)

119
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,432
Uhp, time for your
glocky-drops, Abe.

120
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:58,668
Aw, that stuff makes me blinder
than an umpire in a mineshaft.

121
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:02,795
You know the drill, commodore.
Head back, eyes open.

122
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,073
BOTH:
Rain, rain.

123
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,043
Windshield wipers!

124
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,281
(Calvin hums happily)

125
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,678
Here you go, sweetie.

126
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,050
We made that chestnut stuffing
I know you love.

127
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,661
BLYTHE:
Abe, you're feeding
the thermostat again.

128
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,355
D'oh! Damn glocky-drops!

129
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,962
Yo, our grandfather
Abe Simpson moved out,

130
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,332
but left his...
(shudders) denture cup.

131
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,631
Do you have a lost and found?

132
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,473
Please say you don't have
a lost and found.

133
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:35,738
Oh, Abe's moved out?

134
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:38,206
Well, his room is paid up
for the next two weeks.

135
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,535
Uh, actually, I misspoke.

136
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:44,911
Um, Abe is still using the room.
Using it like crazy.

137
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:46,012
(Lisa exclaims)

138
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,953
We own this place
for two whole weeks.

139
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:51,049
- Hmm.
- We can take a shower
in a chair,

140
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,291
- flush the toilet
a million times...
- Interesting.

141
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:56,657
Oh, you're gonna tell Mom and
Dad about this, aren't you?

142
00:05:56,657 --> 00:06:00,787
Nope, this is one whistle
I'm not gonna blow.

143
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:05,204
Instead,
what if we used this room

144
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,499
to throw the greatest
slumber party ever?

145
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:10,402
No rules, no limits,

146
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:14,214
and, dare I say it,
no slumbering.

147
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,208
(straining):
Tell me more.

148
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:21,282
Also, that kid
is not that good of a cook.

149
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,051
There's such a thing
as chicken being

150
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,020
too tender and juicy, you know?

151
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:28,558
Our wood is really loving
this carnauba stuff.

152
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,785
And what kind of kid
does taxidermy?

153
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,292
Dead animals are meant to be

154
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,433
poked with a stick,
end of story.

155
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:38,829
Homer, you've been complaining
about Calvin for three days.

156
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:41,242
Why are you
so obsessed with him?

157
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,535
What? I don't
think about him at all.

158
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:46,967
But did you notice
how he asked to be excused?

159
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:49,414
That speaks to
a guilty conscience.

160
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,379
And another thing.

161
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:52,277
(lisping):
Why is my tongue swelling up?

162
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,519
- (gasps)
- What is this rash?

163
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:56,375
Oh, my gosh.

164
00:06:56,383 --> 00:07:00,123
You must be having an allergic
reaction to the carnauba wax.

165
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,390
Well, stop using it!

166
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:05,759
I-I've rubbed it
into the floors, the windows.

167
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,029
Every wood surface in the house
has been carnauba'd!

168
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,129
It'll take weeks to dissipate!

169
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,471
But where do I go to breathe?

170
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:15,797
(groans)

171
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,012
Yay, you're here.

172
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,265
I was putting up
glow-in-the-dark stars.

173
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,984
I'll let you
distribute the other half,

174
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,275
since you're
kind of like my brother now.

175
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:27,178
Brother? (scoffs)

This is barely a third. No fair!

Dad!

178
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:39,333
Okay, Harry Potter
chapter read, pillow fluffed...

179
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:42,456
Scary German puppet

Psst. Homer.
Want to play 20 questions?

187
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,719
Okay.
Question number one: Shut up.

188
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,416
(laughs) You're funny.

189
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:05,948
We should go out
on our bikes tomorrow.

190
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:09,263
I know this place by the nuclear
plant that has the best jumps.

191
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,986
Oh, wait.
Did you bring your bike?

192
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,291
I don't have a bike,
I have a car.

193
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,403
And I don't play
at the nuclear plant,

194
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:19,995
I work there
because I am a grown-up.

195
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Abe says I'm mature for my age.

196
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,702
When we check in
at a restaurant,

197
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:24,974
he gives the host my name,

198
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:27,242
so I'm practically
a grown-up, too.

199
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:29,341
No, you're not.
You're a pants-wetting baby.

200
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:32,113
(sputters)
That is patently untrue.

201
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,012
I have
excellent bladder control.

202
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,884
If anything,
I hold it in too long.

203

00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,245
(Grampa chuckles)

352
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:30,133
Homer, you villain!
Do not harm that birdhouse.

353
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,470
The nuthatches
did nothing to you!

354
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:33,996
(sighs heavily)

355
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:35,471
What's wrong with you?

356
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:38,969
My dad kisses the butt
you walk on.

357
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:41,142
I'd get it
if you were great at sports,

358
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:44,211
or fixing cars,
or demolishing buildings,

359
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:46,751
but you're just
a weird little kid.

360
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:49,117
And my dad
hates weird little kids.

361
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:52,016
At least... he sure hated me.

362
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:55,219
Homer, Abe doesn't hate you.

363
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:56,622
Oh, yeah? I'll show you.

364
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,493
We got ten minutes
until his eyedrops wear off.

365
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:01,633
(grunts)
You be me.

366
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:05,474
Dad, do you have a second?

367
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,795
Dang it, Homer. Do you think
I'm made of seconds?

368
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,669
I was in the middle of a very
important word find puzzle.

369
00:16:12,673 --> 00:16:16,143
I was about to find the longest
diagonal of my career.

370
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,413
Now what do you want?!

371
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:18,981
Um, I-I...

372
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,579
You, you, you nothing!

373
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,990
Wow, that was harsh.

374
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:28,516
Do you ever tell him
how he makes you feel?

375
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:31,762
Kinda. I stuck him in the worst
nursing home I could find.

376
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,528
Figured he'd
read between the lines.

377
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:37,027
I think you need to find a new
way to express your feelings.

378
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,670
It might need to be more
than just words.

379
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:44,396
But my way with words be my
best moutha-ma-callits. Aw.

380
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:47,214
You'll figure out a way
to get through to your dad.

381
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,977
You just need to put on
your thinking cap.

382
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:53,481
(muffled music playing)

383
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,750
(clamoring)

384
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:56,949
(Bart grunts)

385
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,190
Where have you been?

386
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,585
I had to get Band-Aids.

387
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:01,716
Lewis got stabbed
with a juice box straw.

388
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:05,192
Somebody fed the pony Pop Rocks
and he kicked out the TV.

389
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,032
His poop is popping!

390
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,727
(crashing, creaking)

391
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,130
The climbing wall collapsed
onto the Reptile Rodeo.

392
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,443
There's loose tails everywhere.

393
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:19,735
I tried to throw a party,
but the party threw me.

394
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,640
I'm putting a stop to this.

395
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:22,942
Are you sure?

396
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,653
You know
what that will make you.

397
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:28,246
Hello? Yes,
I'd like to blow the whistle

398
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:31,988
on an out-of-control party
at The Retirement Castle.

399
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:36,755
Oh, my name?
It's Lisa Simpson, party narc.

400
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,988
Well, the party's shut down,
kids are packing up their stuff.

401
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:43,564
Great.
I'm sure they all hate me.

402
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:45,304
- Yeah, probably.
- (sighs)

403
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:48,899
I gotta dump the churro sugar
out of my shoes.

404
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,272
(laughter)

405
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:52,771
- (gasps)
- They've arrested Lisa!

406
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:56,883
She's paying the ultimate price
for throwing the ultimate party.

407
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:58,707
You're our hero, Lisa!

408
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,710
(gasps)

409
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:03,475
If you drive me home
with the siren on,

410
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:06,623
we've got a freezer
full of Snickers.

411
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,460
- (siren wailing)
- Go, Lisa!

412
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:11,485
- Lisa, you're the best!
- You got this, Lisa!

413
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,291
Call your lawyer!

414
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,700
(indistinct chatter)

415
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:21,939
There's some really
inspiring work here tonight.

416
00:18:22,803 --> 00:18:26,743
Yours is a blistering indictment
of American consumerism.

417
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,540
I love how the middle joey

418
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,282
is looking in
the opposite direction,

419
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:33,107
as if imagining
a different future.

420
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,953
Glad you got that.
I worried it was too subtle.

421
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,519
Oh, it hit me
like a ton of bricks.

422
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:41,559
♪

423
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:45,255
Now, let's announce
tonight's winners.

424
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:48,629
Hold on, there's one more entry!

425
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:52,429
A strange man with an object
hidden under a pillowcase?

426
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:55,802
Come on up!
I want to see this.

427
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,510
I was told to find
a new way to communicate.

428
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:03,406
My stepbrother Calvin expresses
his feelings through taxidermy,

429
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,350
so I decided
I would do the same.

430
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:10,147
That's not taxidermy, you idjit!

431
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,750
But it's very deep. And... sad.

432
00:19:13,754 --> 00:19:17,624
The small shell pleading with
its eyes to the larger one.

433
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:22,034
It is clearly about a son's need
for his father's approval.

434
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:25,729
What? It's just two smelly
shells glued on a board.

435
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:30,542
Abe, look at it.
Really look at it.

436
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:31,807
Hmm.

437
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,805

(gasps)

440
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:44,853
(sniffles) What these shells are
saying, is that how you feel?

441
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:47,892
You seem to love
being a dad to Calvin,

442
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:52,458
but you hated
being a dad to me. (sobs)

443
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:57,129
No, son, no.
See, when you were a kid,

444
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,900
being a dad felt like
the end of my youth.

445
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:02,971
But now with Calvin,

446
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,240
it's my last chance
to feel young.

447
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,910
Oh, so what you're saying is
no matter how old you are,

448
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:14,981
it's only ever been about
what you need.

449
00:20:14,982 --> 00:20:17,752
You finally get me.

450
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:20,291
It wasn't because
I was a bad kid.

451
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:23,817
You're just horribly flawed.

452
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:25,964
I am!

453
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:28,259
(cheering)

454
00:20:28,262 --> 00:20:31,032
Another family
saved by taxidermy.

455
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:32,701
All right, let's wrap things up.

456
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:35,099
We have 20 minutes
before this room is taken over

457

So, Blythe dumped me for a guy

463
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:53,545
she says is a better
spiritual match for her.

464
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:56,494
Also, he's super rich
and can eat corn.

465
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,030
He's taking Calvin to Africa
to study animals

I'm glad you and I
are finally communicating.

469

Anyway, call me back.

just a butt-dial.
