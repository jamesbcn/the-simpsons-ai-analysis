347
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:31,825
MR. BURNS: Ooh.

348
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,706
The sheep was
no danger at all.

349
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,583
I sacflficed my gorgeous
body for nothing.

350
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,539
This must be what it's
like to have a baby.

351
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:42,628
I want a photo of the hero who
risked his life to save me.

352
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,517
(GASPING)

353
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,096
A picture of me
with a smiling child.

354
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,147
I can get my plant back!

100 Industrial Way!

357
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,064
Mr. Burns got
his plant back,

358
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:07,072
and I like to think I found a shred
of humanity in his withered soul.

359
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,743
(SNIFFLING) Oh, Dad. Did
my story make you cry'?

360
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:14,497
(SOBBING)
Well, it was very moving.

361
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,455
But the thing is,
bats are chewing my legs!

00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:35,393
Homer, you brought us to this
horrible place on purpose?

367
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,314
Oh, you didn't think
it was so horrible

368
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,233
when you were
falling down the hole.

369
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,606
That was the most
horrible part of all!

370
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,484
Well, I guess
I should explain.

371
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,612
Not long ago, it was my day
to take care of the baby.

372
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,160
So I was out in
the forest hiding.

HOMER: <i>I deduced
from his parody lyrics</i>

377
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,922
<i>that he was hiding
gold in the cave.</i>

378

miss two or three pieces,</i>

(GUN COCKING) I'll take
that gold if'n you please.

385

How can you take it?
We haven't found it.

386
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,865
It's right there

No, to your left.

you know what's good for you.

Um, is it okay that
I brought my son?

This is my day
with him.

(GRUNTING) If you all don't drop your
guns and behave, no one gets the gold!

407

And why do you really
want it anyway?

00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:48,522
Moe, will the gold
bring back Edna's love?

409
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,981
It could, definitely.

410
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,408
Mr. Burns,
isn't it more important

411
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,236
that you got a child
to smile at you?

412
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,822
Honestly, no.
I'd rather have the gold.

413
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:58,906
Oh, absolutely.

414
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,161
I couldn't agree more.

That gold was turning us
into monsters.

Well, I know a place where we
can atone for our misdeeds.

422

Shelbyville and totally need volunteers.

to study for
my geography test.

Bart, do you expect
me to believe that?

Making out with Moe?

But I thought you didn't
want to date a tavern owner.

At this point, all I want is
a man with a healthy libido.

it gets awkward again.
