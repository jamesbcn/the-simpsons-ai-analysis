I can develop this for you.

{\an8}Yeah, this bar is so poorly lit,

54

Well, it's quite a story.

91
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:29,515
A story of a special bond
between a brother and a sister.

92
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,442
I'd say our story is a tragedy.

93

they can never stop making them.

104
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,090

they were "polar opposites."

114

I want you to get out.

00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,872
(whispers) Thank you.

117
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:33,043
So that's why we started going
to story time at the Kwik-E-Mart.

118
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:36,924
Remember when Apu let Dad
have the expired hot dogs?

119

(groans) Just once,
and I'm still taking medication for it.

120

(groans)
So many photos of you kids fighting.

121
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,885
That's why we never developed that roll.

122
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,891
What? Back to that story?

123
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,596
Why can't you just relax
and be nice to your sister?

124
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,476
My bed scares me.

125
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,773
That's ridiculous.

126
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,776
Now, just close your eyes

127
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,858
and nuzzle in
under the big clown fangs.

128
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,703

Lisa, there are plenty of
mini golf pencils in the kitchen drawer.

and he stole it!

Homer, I just had the worst dream.

I lost one of the kids
at the World's Fair.

That's your answer for everything.

My findings are that one of
your children is smart and good,

160
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,270
and the other is dim and evil.

161

Professionally, I'm not permitted
to say which is which.

-Hey, neighboreeno.
-(groans)

178
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,534
Maude and I know how hard it is
to be dealt a pair of little jokers.

179
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,240
Daddy, may we please go
tuck ourselves in for naps now?

180
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,822
Now, you know you can't tuck
yourselves in till you're 18.

181
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,948
-Go get Mommy.
-(humming happily)

182
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,956
-I'm sorry you had to witness that.
-Me, too.

183
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,629
Anyway, Maude and I thought
you'd like to hang out with adults

184
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,958
and have some mature conversatiaroonies,
so we'd like to take you to brunch.

185
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,505
Brunch? I wish.

186
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,798
Can't get a sitter
'cause our kids are nuts,

187
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,972
and no kennel will take them.

188
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,564
Now, sir,
don't you waffle on that brunch.

189
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,429
Grandma Flanders can watch the kids.

190
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,636
Hello, Joe.

191
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,305
Doesn't know who I am...
has trouble moving...

192
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,355
I'd say we have ourselves babysitter.

193
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,398
I just turned 100.

194
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,362
-Eight bucks an hour.
-I can't hear you.

195
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,073
I said seven bucks!

196
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,243
<i>(over speaker): "Woe to you,</i>
<i>scribes, Pharisees, hypocrites.</i>

197
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,707
<i>For you tithe mint and dill and cumin."</i>

198
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,668
Todd, I like how gentle
you are with that toy.

199
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,249
Enough nonsense.

200
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,094
It's time for prayers.

201
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,379
I don't know any prayers.

202
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,923
Is "hell's bells" a prayer?

203
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,677
'Cause Daddy says it all the time.

204
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,598
(screams)

205
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,178
(Homer humming)

206
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,853
Woop...

207
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,141
and woop... and...

208
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,726
-ziperoo.
-(moans)

209
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:08,192
I never said this before,
but the food can wait.

210
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,734
(gasps)
What do you mean?

211
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,737
Let's role-play.

212
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,279
Okay, but fast.

213
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,862
Um, um, got it.

214
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,617
Uh, me-- seagull.

215
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,659
You-- boardwalk trash can.

216
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,793
-Ooh!
-(caws)

217
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,121
(horn honks)

218
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,455
Well, isn't this a great chance
to drink more water?

219
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,295
My bladder's going to burst.

220
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,170
I know you've had a few too many waters,

221
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,967
but that is no reason for the sailor talk.

222
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,560
She's awfully quiet.

223
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,849
Her body usually whistles.

224
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,352
Well, this always wakes my grandpa up.

225
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,860
(both scream)

226
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,400
(continue screaming)

They're never that happy

Mmm, that was wonderful.

238
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,509
My favorite kind of weekend morning.

239
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,727
A sexy snuggle while our rotten kids
are someone else's problem.

240
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,980
(laughs)

241
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,318

243
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,832
Bart, those are strangers.

244
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,409
You're right, let's go where it's safe.

245
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,825
-(horn honks)

246
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,173

Faster, faster.

248
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,335
Your brother is stupid.

249
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,336

254
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,203
Thank you for a wonderful brunch.

255
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,203
I don't know what I liked more--

256
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,155
the personalized omelets
or the light jazz combo.

257
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,706
I liked when the trumpet player's
cheeks got really big.

258
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,961
-That's good music.
-(Ned gasps)

259
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,553
(screams)

260
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,878
Grandma Flanders has passed.

261
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,514
-Where are our kids?
-Gone.

262
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,262
Looks like once Grandma turned
to dust, they took a powder.

263
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,014
Sorry if that seems a little flip.

264
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,766
(hyperventilating)
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

265
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,268
Don't worry, sweetie.

266
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,229
We'll call the local police,
and they'll find our kids.

267
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,810
We never used them till now,

268
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,935
but I'm sure they're highly competent.

269
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,982
Gunderson, before we hire you,
one final test.

270
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,987
Can you get these handcuffs off of me?

271
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,489
Uh, might seem like
a one-time situation, but it's not.

272
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,533
(telephone ringing)

273
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,791
Hey, you know, I used to represent
Silver Star Police Supplies.

274
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,333
Then they gave my territory
to the owner's nephew.

275
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,707
And they wonder why
they lost Jackson City.

276
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,085
I was Jackson City!

277
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,592
Yeah, focus on the cuffs, please.

278
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,347
Well, well, look who's burning plastic.

279
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,845
It's mine. Give it back.

280
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,144
Looks like someone hasn't learned--

281
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,148
you don't argue with bullies.

282
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,190
Thank goodness I have a teaching fist.

283
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,784
(laughing)

284
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,070
(Lisa crying)

285
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,697
What's her problem?

286
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,327
Please, don't hurt my brother.

287
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,043
Aw, come on. Don't cry.

288
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,384
This is why I'm so nervous
about becoming a dad.

289
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,341
(snorts, cries)

290
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,421
I'm crying out my nose.

291
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,717
(snorts, cries)

292
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,295
Fine, you babies can go.

293
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,518
Let's go over to Mommy & Me
and cut holes in the parachute

294
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,979
so it doesn't billow properly.

295
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,231
(Kearney laughs) Baby!

296
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,902
-All right, let's move.
-Why aren't you crying?

297
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,982
I was pretending, and it worked.

298
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,437
Hmm.

299
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,947
You know, kid,
with your smarts and my Barts,

300
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,659
we make a good team.

301
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:26,869
What are "Barts"?

302
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,579
You're the smart one.
You figure it out.

303
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,830
(nervous groan)
I sure hope this book is right.

304
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,371
(door opens)

305
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,917
HOMER: Marge, I'm back.

306
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,671
Sorry, nothing.

307
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,422
But if we have a third kid,
we should call her Maggie.

308
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,835
Why Maggie?

309
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,343
It's a good name if we lose her.

310
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,505
Maggie? Maggie?

311
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,434
Going back out.

312
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,097
Maggie?

313
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,600
All right, I'm turning
to a desperate mother's last resort.

314
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,733
(sighs)

315
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,483
I hope it works.

316
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,028
Psychic hotline.

317
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,361
Selma? You're a psychic now?

318
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,867
I'm filling in for a friend.

319
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,328
She got hit by a car.

320
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,908
Never saw it coming.

321
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,123
(groans)

322
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,122
I'll never see my kids again.

323
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,964
I'm sensing...

324
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,500
it's all your husband's fault.

325
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,173
That'll be $20.

326
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,841
(groans)

327
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,005
I know this place.

328
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,509
It's where Grampa
and his friends the monsters live.

329
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,552
(creepy moaning)

330
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,006
(moans)

331
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,715
I want to pinch 'em.

332
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,845
Teach me how to use my phone.

333
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,404
Stay away from my grandchildren,
you love-sucking ghouls.

334
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,229
(moaning like zombies)

335
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,074
(muttering)

336
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,189
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

337
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,486
I made it out of clay.

338
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,110
(moans)

339
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,817
Where did you go?

340
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,447
Now, you have some candy,

341
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,914
while I tell the nurses station
to go get your folks.

342
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,631
(snoring)

343
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,920
I guess you should be in charge, Lisa.

344
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:07,264
You'll always be half my age,
but you'll always be smarter than me.

345
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,971
Don't worry, Bart,
you'll always think you're in charge,

346
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,802
even though I secretly will be.

347
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,217
Thank you.

348
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,524
Okay. Listen up, you childless losers.

349
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
I need you to help me find my kids.

350
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,936
Any of these them? Hmm?

351
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,978
-Uh... no.
-Sorry, kids.

352
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,107
I'll place you with your parents,

-Yeah.
