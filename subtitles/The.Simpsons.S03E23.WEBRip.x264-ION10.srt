00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,063
Webster's Dictionary
defines excellence

178
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,816
as "The quality or condition
of being excellent."

179
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,230
And now the winner

180
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,648
of the First Annual
Montgomery Burns Award

181
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:12,408
for Outstanding Achievement
in the Field of Excellence.

182
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,452
Please, please,
please, please...

183
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,834
Dad, you know you won.

184
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:15,871
Don't jinx it.

185
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,873
The winner: Homer Simpson.

186
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,746
Oh, my God!

187
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,043
Woo-hoo! I win!

188
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,536
(laughing)

189
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,633
Hey!

190
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,424
MWah, mwah, mwah--

191
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,678
(screaming)

192
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,639
(loud thump)

193
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,306
Keep those
pickled eggs coming, Moe.

194
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,601
You cleaned me out,
Smokin' Joe.

195
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,935
What's the matter,
Homer?

196
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,940
Cummerbund too tight?

197
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,941
I miss my couch.

198
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,113
I know how you feel.
You lost the couch.

199
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,112
I lost the heavyweight
championship.

200
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,284
(scoffs)
Heavyweight championship.

201
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,493
There's like three of those.

202
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,532
That couch was one of a kind.

203
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,406
Homer, I know things
are tough now,

204
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,993
but one day,
you'll be walking along

205
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,828
and you'll see
a piece of furniture

206
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,083
you can love
just as much.

207
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,745
Hey, Frazier,
shut up!

208
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,463
Barney, you been riding
my back all night.

209
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,005
Oh, yeah?
Care to step outside?

210
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:08,969
Let's do it.

211
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:14,797
(punching and
Barney screaming)

212
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,887
I think I'm going
to take a walk.

213
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:21,273
All right!
A peanut. (crunching)

214
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,482
I'm telling you,
all a man needs is an idea,

215
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,324
and I've got an idea.

216
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,109
Then how come
you're still a bum?

217
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,242
All right.
A man needs two things:

218
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:33,609
An idea and money
to get it off the ground.

219
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,078
Hello, what's this?

220
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:39,078
(reading headline aloud)

221
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,371
Hmm.

222
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,747
Any of you guys know

223
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,344
which freight
goes to Springfield?

224
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,299
(train approaching)

225
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,625
Uh-uh.

226
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,007
No.

227
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,262
No.

228
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,553
That's the one!

229
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:03,637
I feel so empty,
so alone, so couchless.

230
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,268
(gasping)

231
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:09,614
Wow! The Spinemelter 2000.

232
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,242
(loud vibrating)

233
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Give me full power.

234
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,494
-But, sir...
-Damn it!

235
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,412
I said full power.

236
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:21,575
(vibrations getting louder)

237
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,922
(eerie, out-of-body music
playing)

238
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,136
LISA:
Dad? Dad?

239
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,483
(voice quavering)
I'll take it.

240
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,061
This chair is $2,000.

241
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,897
We can buy a whole
living room set for that.

242
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,402
Marge, there's an empty spot
I've always had inside me.

243
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,396
I tried to fill it
with family, religion

244
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,028
community service,
but those were dead ends.

245
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,655
I think this chair
is the answer.

246
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,123
This money was a blessing.

247
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,753
We can't just spend it on
some creature comfort.

248
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,290
All right,
we won't get the chair.

249
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,424
Now excuse me
while I kiss the sky.

250
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,252
(loud vibrating)

251
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,087
Ahh...

252
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,391
Hmm...

253
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,971
(chimes ringing melodically)

254
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,478
Yes?

255
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,809
Oh, sorry,
I must have the wrong house.

256
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,725
Oh-ho, that's where
you're wrong, friend.

257
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,324
Aren't we in luck?
Today's our tithe day,

258
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,980
and we've got ourselves
a transient.

259
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:37,358
Come in, my friend.
Let us feed and bathe you.

260
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,656
Hey, wait a minute.

261
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,869
Dad, can I anoint
the sores on his feet?

262
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,410
I think
it's Mom's turn, son.

263
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,993
Oh, no fair.

264
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,748
Thanks for the suit.

265
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,500
Well, if you ever want
to spend the night,

266
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,711
Maude and I
can sleep on card tables.

267
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,802
<i>♪ Onward,</i>
<i>Christian soldiers ♪</i>

268
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,168
ALL:

269
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,127
(moans)
They're singing again.

270
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,507
Lousy neighbors.
Wish I was deaf.

271
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,854
(doorbell ringing)

272
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,310
What am I gonna say?

273
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,680
This is the guy who ruined me.

274
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,187
But on the other hand,
he's family.

275
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,860
So many conflicting emotions.
How to express them?

276
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,320
Herb?

277
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,779
BOTH:
Uncky herb!

278
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:21,865
Bart! Lisa!

279
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,949
I'm so glad to see you.

280
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,704
You weren't
so glad to see me.

281
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,456
I'm sorry, Homer,
but I'm still mad at you.

282
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,789
Every word you say just makes me
want to punch you in the face.

283
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,126
Well, while you're
a guest in my home,

284
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,840
could you just
kick me in the butt?

285
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,420
I'll try, but I'm not
making any promises.

286
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,046
(gasps) Herb!
How have you been?

287
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,804
I've been living
in a cardboard box,

288
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,176
sleeping on grates,
eating out of dumpsters. You?

289
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,644
Mmm, can't complain.

290
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,484
Herb, let me give you
the grand tour.

291
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,599
This is one
of our many light switches.

292
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,356
It functions in both
the on and off mode.

293
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,649
On, off. On, off.

294
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,363
Homer, he knows how
to work a light switch.

295
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,243
Oh, yeah, right.

296
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,820
I don't know what's
this switch does.

297
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,695
(playing "Deck the Halls")

298
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,453
Mmm. This is really
good, Marge.

299
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,544
I got the recipe from
the Utility Grade Beef Council.

300
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,161
They do good work.

301
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,827
Uncky Herb, what advice
would you give to a boy

302
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,297
who will most likely become
a bum like yourself?

303
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,878
Discarded pizza boxes

304
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,303
are an inexpensive
source of cheese.

305
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,802
Lisa, aren't you happy
to see me?

306
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,635
Why didn't you write,
Unky Herb?

307
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,390
Hey, if I wrote to you
what was I supposed to say?

308
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,062
"Dear Lisa, last night

309
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,060
I used a rat for a pillow
thanks to your pop"?

310
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,982
I see your point.

311
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,521

313
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,778
(chuckles)

314
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,740
Maggie, I'm going to let you
in on a little secret.

315
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,333
You're gonna
make me rich again.

316
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:50,038
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

317
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,504
One, two, three...
Ventnor Avenue.

318
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,132
And while on
Ventnor Avenue

319
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,919
you'll be staying
at the fabulous Hotel Lisa.

320
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:58,963
A valet
will be around shortly

321
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,876
to park
your thimble.

322
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,715
Of course, there is
the unpleasant matter of the bill.

323
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,051
Get to the point.

324
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,045
1150 bones.

325
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,307
(groaning)
That's all I got.

326
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,350
Broke again, eh, Herb?
Just like in real life.

327
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,895
I guess you're just not
much of a businessman.

328
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,063
Oh...

329
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,767
Maybe we should play
another game.

330
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,278
{\an8}Why are we playing games when we
got two grand in the bank?

331
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,820
{\an8}Remember when Dad won the First
Annual Montgomery Burns Award

332
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,704
{\an8}For Outstanding Achievement
in the Field of Excellence?

333
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,412
Well, I think
we should invest

334
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,042
in a set of the "Great Books
of Western Civilization."

335
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,040
Look at this ad
from New Republic for Kids.

336
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,832
"Each month, a new classic
will be delivered to our door."

337
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,837
"'Paradise Regained,'
Martin Chuzzlewit

338
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,009
or Herman Melville's twin
classics, 'Omoo" and 'Typee.'"

339
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,969
Wait, Marge, didn't you want to
spend that money on a vibrating chair?

340
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,760
That was your idea.

341
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,764
I think we should
get a machine gun.

342
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,966
We could use it to hunt game,
spell out things,

343
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,266
or ring in the new year.

344
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,559
Well, I really think

345
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,692
we need to replace
the washer and dryer.

346
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,809
(loud rumbling)

347
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,266
(screeching meow)

348
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,896
How would you like
to spend $2,000

349
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,244
to give a broken man
a second chance?

350
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,030
-Nah.
-Hmm, wait, Herb,

351
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,283
what are you talking about?

352
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,374
Buh, buh, buh, buh--
Not here.

353
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,029
Come into
the dining room.

354
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,447
I wanna give you
a 20-minute presentation

355
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,116
that will change
the world.

356
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,624
20 minutes? Oh...

357
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,667
Okay, now before I tell you
about my idea,

358
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,502
I'd like to show you this.

359
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,392
It's drinking the water!

360
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,510
Take it easy, Homer.

361
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,926
Now, this is an example

362
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,144
of how one little idea,
carefully marketed--

363
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,975
This is the greatest
invention in the world.

364
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,982
You'll make a million dollars.

365
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,694
No, Homer, that invention
is out already.

366
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,685
I'm just using it as an example.

367
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,107
(chuckles)
It's going back for more.

368
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,657
Oh...

369
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,450
Homer, this is my invention.

370
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,204
Now of course,
with these blueprints,

371
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,786
you'll have to use
your imagination.

372
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:59,081
HOMER:
Hmm? What the...

373
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,000
Hmm...

374
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,587
(laughing)

375
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,223
It's a baby translator.

376
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,799
It measures the pitch,

377
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:12,144
the frequency, and the urgency
of a baby's cries.

378
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,971
Then it tells whoever's
around, in plain English,

379
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,887
exactly what the baby
is trying to say.

380
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,687
Everything from "change me"

381
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,060
to "turn off
that damn Raffi record."

382
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,647
Ooh! That's a very
clever idea.

383
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,863
All I need is a couple
of thousand dollars

384
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,154
to build a prototype.

385
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,857
You'll have
your money back

386
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,317
in 30 days, I swear.

387
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,987
I think we owe a debt
to Uncky Herb.

388
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,655
He took us in to his home
and Dad destroyed him.

389
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,664
Dad, you know some shyster's
gonna bilk you out of your money.

390
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,367
It may as well
be your brother.

391
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,087
All right, Herb,
I'll lend you the 2,000 bucks,

392
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,088
but you have to forgive me
and treat me like a brother.

393
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,461
-No.
-Okay, then

394
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,838
just give me the drinking bird.

395
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,010
(Maggie babbling)

396
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,845
Let's see, what could you
be trying to say?

397
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,060
-(baby talk)
-Nothing downstairs.

398
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,982
You just
took a nap.

399
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,230
(sucking)

400
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,021
"I want to suck
your nose."

401
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,694
Hooga-booga,
hooga-booga, hooga-booga.

402
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,944
(baby talk)

403
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,237
"I'm scared."

404
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,319
Hmm...

405
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,074
the amplitude
of the sine wave

406
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,866
is insufficient
for "burp me,"

407
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,699
{\an8}and this sawtooth formation
is something I've nev--

408
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:17,695
{\an8}Blah!

409
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,286
{\an8}Eureka.

410
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,831
Now, I bet
you're all wondering

411
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,584
what lies under
this sheet.

412
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,336
Not really. We peeked inside
while you were in the john.

413
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,379
Oh.

414
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,632
Well, here it is again...

415
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,514
my baby translator.

416
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,683
Ooh!

417
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,102
Marge, you don't
have to humor me.

418
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,510
Well, it's
pretty ingrained.

419
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,138
What do you think,
Homer?

420
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,894
Herb, this is the stupidest
thing I've ever seen.

421
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,767
I can't believe
we blew 2,000 bucks on it,

422
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,895
when right now rollers
could be kneading my buttocks.

423
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,993
Homer, could you stop
thinking about your ass?

424
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,199
I try,
but I can't.

425
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,819
(baby talk)

426
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,656
<i>Lavish attention on me</i>
<i>and entertain me.</i>

427
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,832
Oh, Maggie,
you talked!

428
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,661
You see?
It tells you exactly

429
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,326
what's on the baby's mind.

430
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,254
Maggie.
Maggie.

431
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,463
(baby talk)

432
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,542
<i>Where did you go?</i>

433
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,537
Peek-a-boo!

434
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,708
(baby talk)

435
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,336
<i>Oh, there you are.</i>
<i>Very amusing.</i>

436
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,053
Well, Homer,
now what do you think?

437
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,383
I don't know, Herb.

438
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,218
People are afraid
of new things.

439
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,893
You should have taken
an existing product

440
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,721
and put a clock in it
or something.

441
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,227
Homer, every mother
in the country

442
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,018
is going to
want one of these.

443
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,102
(baby talk)

444
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,317
<i>I have soiled myself.</i>
<i>How embarrassing.</i>

445
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,358
I gave Herb all the money
I had in the world,

446
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,914
and he still treats me like
something he dug out of his ear.

447
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,579
Don't worry, he can't stay
mad at you forever.

448
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,739
He is your brother.

449
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,997
But when is he going
to act like it?

450
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,470
This radio-controlled plane

451
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,430
gives your baby
the chance to fly,

452
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,350
just like my son here.

453
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:02,428
He can execute the barrel roll,
the loop-de-loop,

454
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:06,016
then bring it in for
the perfect landing. Uh!

455
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,023
(crowd gasping)

456
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,024
Oh, dear.

457
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,725
My wife is going to kill me.

458
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,362
(baby talk)

459
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,284
<i>I only want to eat candy.</i>

460
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,163
Then that's all you'll get.

461
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,830
(baby talk)

462
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,288
<i>This leash demeans us both.</i>

463
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,368
-I'll take two!
-I'll take a dozen!

464
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,623
I represent the Precious Baby
discount stores.

465
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,326
I'll take 50,000!

466
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,916
I'm rich again!

467
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,421
U.S.A.!
U.S.A.!

468
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,843
U.S.A.!

469
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:36,761
Homer, here's a check
for $2,000.

470
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,682
But I also wanted to give you
each a little something

471
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,350
for believing in me.

472
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,639
Lisa, this is
the first volume

473
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,813
of "The Great Books
of Western Civilization."

474
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,522
You'll receive a new one
every month,

475
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,942
from "Beowulf"
to "Less than Zero".

476
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,151
Finally a copy of "Ethan Frome"
to call my own.

477
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,032
Now Bart,
I know you're too young

478
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,739
for that machine gun
you wanted,

479
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,069
but I'm gonna give
you something

480
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,664
that will make sure
when you're old enough,

481
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,199
you can still buy one...

482
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,702
a membership in
the National Rifle Association.

483
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,504
Wow! The N.R.A.!

484
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,329
Can I get armor-piercing,
cyanide-tipped bullets too?

485
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,375
It's in the Constitution, son.

486
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,049
Maggie, who brought
me my fortune,

487
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:16,508
I'll give you anything you
want in this world.

488
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,760
(baby talk)

489
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,841
<i>I want what the dog's eating.</i>

490
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,427
-D'oh!
-I'll get you something nice.

491
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,971
Now, Marge--

492
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,595
Herb, I appreciate
your generosity,

493
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,391
but I don't need
any gift from you.

494
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,725
You're too late, Marge.

495
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,099
I got you
a new washer and dryer,

496
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,147
and I sold the old ones
for 50 bucks.

497
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,071
-(shouting and cheering)
-Go, go go!

498
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,279
-(loud rumbling)
-Come on, washer!

499
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,150
(cheering)

500
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,407
Oh, you stupid dryer!

501
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,119
Herb, I don't think

502
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,909
there's a vibrating chair
in that bag for me.

503
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,913
Homer,
walk me to my car.

504
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,617
What do I get?
What do I get?

505
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,166
It's not another
punch in the face, is it?

506
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,750
Because if it is,
I don't want it.

507
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,254
This is what you get,
Homer.

508
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,956
I forgive you.

509
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,376
You can call me brother,
and I can do the same.

510
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,295
-That's it?
-That's it.

511
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,845
I see your point...
brother.

512
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,809
Give me a hug...
brother.

513
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,019
All right...

514
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,429
but I never really
hugged a man before.

515
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,653
(both chuckling)

516
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,781
Homer, I bought you
the damn chair.

517
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,068
(loud smacking)

518
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,322
Come on, come on, come on.

519
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,534
Go on, go on,
that's enough.

520
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,743
All right,
get out of here.
