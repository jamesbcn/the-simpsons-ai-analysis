to show who's the better mother.

172
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:21,995
Love it.

173
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,830
Why don't you do something for me?

174
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,000
Take a deep breath in.

175
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,837
[growls]

176
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,340
Oh, boy. Yeah, that's what I thought.

177
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:37,552
Mom, your primitive brain
is running the show right now.

178
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,805
One of your cubs, if you will,
has been threatened,

179
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,099
but in a 21st-century sort of way.

180
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,146
In response, your body has entered a state
of arousal called "fight-or-flight."

181
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,689
I'm not in a state.

182
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,566
These are my calm veins.

183
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:55,696
Remember, you have access
to higher brain function.

184
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:06,957
So, breathe in the expensive candle,
exhale the tension.

185
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,126
There is no threat.

186
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,504
Your cubs are safe.

187
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:17,050
Smell the "Fresh Morning Airport"?

188
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,177
Ew.

189
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,011
There's no threat.

190
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,513
Bart is okay.

191
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,681
That's right.

192
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,684
No need to fight or flee.

193
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,436
No threat.

194
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,062
[Lisa shrieks]

195
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,399
No threat at all.

196
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,067
[chuckles]

197
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,951
{\an8}We have a motion from a concerned parent

198
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:47,790
to ban all books
about fallen women from the library.

199
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,042
{\an8}So, motion denied.

200
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,545
I'm pulling my boy from this school.

201
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,464
It didn't have to go down like this.

202
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,717
[growls]

203
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:03,263
I move to dismiss Marge Simpson
from this board for bullying my son.

204
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,390
[crowd gasps]

205
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,227

[children whimper]

208
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,165
Bullying? You wanna talk about bullying?

209
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:35,628
She went out of her way to make my son
feel excluded, less than and othered.

210
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,880
[crowd gasps]

211
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,966
That's the worst thing there be.

212
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,177
[wolf roars, whimpers]

213
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,972
[both growl]

214
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:50,226
{\an8}Look at what her son did to the
third grade production of <i>West Side Story</i>.

215
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,728
- [crowd exclaims]
- [person] Butts!

216
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,731
That's the kind of behavior
you learn in the home.

217
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,400
[growls]

218
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,402
You're criticizing my home?

219
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,488
You ever been to her dusty house?

220
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,907
You think nature abhors a vacuum.

221
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,408
[Ice Age Marge grunts]

222
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,702
Look up the word "no", Marge.

223
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,829
Trust me, it can do wonders with children.

224
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,081
- [wolf growls]
- [Ice Age Marge grunts]

225
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:15,586
Well, you could learn how
to say "yes" to a lice comb.

226
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,838
She grocery shops at the Kwik-E-Mart.

227
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,175
Swedish Fish are not a protein.

228
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,260
At least Bart likes my lunches.

229
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:27,890
Milhouse is the most frequent lunch trader
in the cafeteria.

230
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,975
[wolf whimpers, growls]

231
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,644
That is a lie.

232
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:38,067
I pack an extra lunch for Milhouse
because I feel sorry for him.

233
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,736
[Ice Age Homer grunts, growls]

[both grunt]

235
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:54,040
Okay, a lot of big feelings.

236
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,084
I do love mess.

237
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,335
This isn't over.

238
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,256
Not by a long shot, sister.

239
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,907
[horns honking]

240
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,454
Oh, my God.
Look who Milhouse had to bring.

241
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,374
Kindergartners.

242
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,584
[kindergartner cries]

243
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,379
You said we were going to see <i>CoComelon</i>.

244
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,808
Evening, ma'am. What brings you here?

245
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:54,893
Parking, I bet.

246
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,936
We're in The Front Row Club.

247
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,147
{\an8}I believe parking is included.

248
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,524
Oh, we don't accept paper tickets.

249
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,984
You have to use the app.

250
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,068
What app?

251
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,613
The app it says you're required to use.

252
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:10,408
Right here on this
piece of paper that is not a ticket.

253
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,952
Homer, the mustache man who has every job

254
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,663
says we need the app you used
to buy the tickets.

255
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,833
Oh, I deleted that app
the second I printed them out.

256
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,501
Can I download the app?

257
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,253
Well, you'll need his password.

258
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,547
Oh, it's in my password wallet.

259
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,257
But I deleted that too.

260
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,259
Why do you keep deleting apps?

261
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,265
I like the way they jiggle
in fear right before you drop the hammer.

262
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,686
[Kirk] Come on, homeslice.

263
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,771
It's your pick.

264
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,940
Are you with Kirk?

265
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,610
Um, well, it's our fantasy football draft.

266
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,112
After everything those people
have done to Bart?

267
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,781
[gasps] Traitor.

268
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,617
You are dead to me.

273
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,652
Pull forward and turn your car around.

274
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,736
Pally.

275
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,530
Aw, you can't get in?

276
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:34,451
Well, don't worry, we'll post pics
so Bart can see all the fun he's missing.

Have you lost your mind?

281
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,050
I'm going to save you.

282
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,761
How is this saving me?

Tickets, please.

00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:01,037
Some of these people
are carrying outside food.

290
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,207
Outside food! Outside food!

291
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,418
[patron screams]

292
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:24,227
We're either leaving here
in $50 T-shirts or handcuffs.

293
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,981
Perhaps a third course of action
will present itself... [screams]

294
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,569
[children] Whoa!

295
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,908
Look, guys, we made it.

296
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,244
The Front Row Club!

297
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,620
Maybe you should take us home.

298
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,498
I don't think anybody's that psyched
for the concert anymore.

299
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,582
Go home?

300
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,251
And let Luann win?

301
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,546
Why don't you ask
that lady what she thinks?

302
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,005
[groans]

303
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,757
Now you know what we're all thinking.

304
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,926
Not me. I'm cool with you.

305
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:00,304
Oh, sweetie. I'm so, so sorry.

306
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,266
I've just been feeling
a whole range of emotions:

307
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,811
anger, rage, fury, even miffed.

308
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:12,441
{\an8}But I swear it was all because I never
want anything bad to ever happen to you.

309
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,609
I can handle bad.

310
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,488
I can't handle losing
the one good parent I've got.

00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,987
Why couldn't you just let me invite Bart?

315
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,616
Oh, honey, but think of how jealous
and miserable he must be right now.

316
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,242
Isn't that satisfying?

317
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,744
Mostly isn't.

318
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:10,082
I know Bart's a bad influence, but he's
the only kid who wants to influence me.

319
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,001
He's all I got.

320
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:16,131

be much fun without Bart's best friend.
