00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,702
One World Trade Plaza."

180
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,493
Hmm.
Whoo.

181
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,002
Aah!

182
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,829
Aaaah!

183
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,554
Oh!

184
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,264
MARGE: Wow.

185
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,010
Governor's Island looks
so insignificant from up here.

186
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,514
Hey, immigrants! Beat it!

187
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,006
Country's full!

188
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,138
OK, folks, you heard the lady.

189
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,555
Back into the hold.

190
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,643
We'll try Canada.

191
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,057
(disappointed moans)

192
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,515
(speaking native language)

193
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,436
Stupid city.

194
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,947
What the hell is this thing?

195
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,279
(groaning)

196
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,494
C-come off!

197
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,695
Come... off.

198
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,291
All right, you.

199
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,119
(angry muttering)

200
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,751
Ow.

201
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,126
MAN (shouting): Hey!
When you're done with that,

202
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,973
I got something up here
you can bite on!

203
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,299
Hey! Why don't you be polite
you stinking pus bag!

204
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,306
Pal, you got to call that
number right on the boot!

205
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,719
Sorry about that guy.

206
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,097
They stick all the jerks
in Tower One!

207
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,814
That's it!
I'm coming over there!

208
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,274
Yeah, why don't
you come over here!

209
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,364
(both arguing)

210
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,439
Shut up, the both of yous!

211
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,444
<i>WOMAN: Thank you for calling</i>
<i>the Parking Violations Bureau.</i>

212
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,407
<i>To plead not guilty,</i>

213
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,953
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Your plea has been...</i>

214
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,453

(dial tone)

221
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,881
They expect me to sit here
from 9:00 to 5:00?

222
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,756
That's... How many hours?

223
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,762
Ten, 11... Denominator.

224
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,182
Oh! Where's Lisa
when you need her?

225
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,806
Here's a better idea.

226
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,976
You give me your address,
and I'll write to you.

227
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:50,936
Uh, OK.

228
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,355
Just send it to...
Jesus, care of the Pentagon.

229
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,815
I'm so glad we took the subway.

230
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,373
"Laser wart removal"?

231
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,830
Wow. The future is here.

232
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,004
Hey, where's Bart?

233
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,000
(coins rattling)

234
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,501
Ladies and gentlemen,

235
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,542
I'm sorry to disturb
your pleasant ride.

236
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,666
but unlike yourselves,
I was born without taste buds.

237
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,054
Let me demonstrate.

238
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,470
(groaning)

239
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:17,218
Ew. I'm in over my head here.

240
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,891
Thank you for your time.

241
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,427
Ah...

242
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,425
Come on. Pick up the pace.

243
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,734
Hey, I'm not a bum.

244
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,015
Thanks, but I don't need...

245
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,725
OK, if you insist, but...

246
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,687
Spare change, lady?

247
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,936
Lousy cheapskate.

248
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,283
So hungry.

249
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,327
Can't leave car.

250
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,710
Getting closer.

251
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,828
Closer.

252
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,711
Almost...

253
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,172
there.

254
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,799
(snapping)

255
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:53,748
Ow!

256
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,760
MAN: Fresh Khlav Kalash!

257
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,510
Get your Khlav Kalash!

258
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,761
Hey, could you go
across the street

259
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:00,894
and get me a slice of pizza?

260
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,100
No pizza, only Khlav Kalash.

261
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,560
Oh, shoot.

262
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,887
All right, all right.
Give me one bowl.

263
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,306
No bowl. Stick. Stick.

264
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,863
Aaah! Geez!

265
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,070
That's just awful.

266
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,278
Mmm.

267
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,493
Now, what do you have

268
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,073
to wash that awful taste
out of my mouth?

269
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,948
Mountain dew or crab juice.

270
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,834
Blech! Ew! Geez!

271
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,538
I'll take a crab juice.

272
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,755
(belches)

273
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,761
Uh-oh.

274
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,471
Uh... You got
a men's room in there?

275
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,972
Only Khlav Kalash.

276
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:43,973
Men's room in tower.

277
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,274
Tower. Observation deck.

278
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,928
(whimpering)

279
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,937
But I can't leave my car
until the parking guy gets here.

280
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:55,233
Oh, why did I drink
all that crab juice?

281
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,282
Mmm.

282
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,739
(whistling)

283
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,236
Don't even think about it, pal.

284
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,624
{\an8}Are we still in Little Italy?

285
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,793
{\an8}Actually, I think
we're in Chinatown now.

286
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,292
Only in New York.

287
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,793
Mom, are those rabbits dead?

288
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,377
No. No, Lisa.

289
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,302
They're just... Sleeping...

290
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,430
Upside down and inside out.

291
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:22,844
Bart.

292
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,887
No fireworks. Put that back.

293
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,060
You're the boss.

294
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,642
Oh, no!

295
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,136
Chinese firedrill!

296
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,438
Serious this time.

297
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,610
(whimpering)

298
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,154
Come on, boot guy.

299
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,075
Oh. Flushing Meadows.

300
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,580
(celestial chorus)

301
00:13:55,042 --> 00:14:00,212
(toilets flushing)

302
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,125
{\an8}Oh, I can't take it anymore.

303
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,508
All right, I'll only be gone
for a second.

304
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,845
Frontsies, backsies,
I'm with them.

305
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,135
V.I.P Coming through.

306
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,478
Very important person.

307
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,483
They gave me frontsies.

308
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,942
(elevator bell dings)

309
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,236
(gasps)

310
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,862
How frightfully rude.

311
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,527
I certainly hope someone
stabs him in the eye.

312
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,618
(elevator dings)

313
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,163
Gah!

314
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,749
{\an8}(pained moan)

315
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,211
{\an8}(zipping)

316
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,171
(lift bell dings twice)

317
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,505
(lift bell dings twice)

318
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,845
(loud groan of relief)

319
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,362
Oh, yes.

320
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,276
(gasps)

321
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,658
D'ohh!

322
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,991
<i>D-ohh!</i>

323
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,235
<i>D'ohh!</i>

324
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,367
<i>D'ohh!</i>

325
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,913
<i>D'ohh!</i>

326
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,500
(panting)

327
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,496
What?

328
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,127
"Failure to wait by vehicle..."

329
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,093
$250?

330
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,554
You... Oh!

331
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,844
(angry muttering)

332
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,388
Oh, no.

333
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,641
It's getting dark.

334
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,892
Well, that's it.

335
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,643
I'm getting out of
this town alive if it kills me.

336
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,354
(engine revving)

337
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,727
(boot clanging)

338
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,605
(tires screeching)

339
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,747
(laughing)

340
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:55,788
Ow!

341
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,161
(laughing)

342
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,287
Ow!

343
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,504
(laughing)

344
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,963
Ow!

345
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,003
Ow!

346
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,468
Look at
all those beautiful shoes.

347
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,433
I know they're made
from animals, but wow.

348
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,935
Mmm, If only I didn't already
have a pair of shoes.

349
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,348
Speaking of shoes,
I don't care about shoes.

350
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,267
I'll meet you ladies
back here in half an hour.

351
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,516
OK, Dad.

352
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,107
Stay where
I can see you, honey.

353
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,859
(gasps)

354
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,777
{\an8}MAD Magazine?

355
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,325
(moaning)

356
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,167
(breathes sharply)

357
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,010
Excuse me.
Is this MAD Magazine?

358
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,218
No, it's Mademoiselle.

359
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,678
We're buying our sign
on the installment plan.

360
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,972
Seriously though,
my name is Bart Simpson.

361
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,265
My father has a subscription.

362
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,018
I'd like
