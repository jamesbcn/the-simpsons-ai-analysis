{\an8}Hey, why didn't you tell me
the new issue of <i>Weird </i>was here?

{\an8}(chuckles)

13
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,585
{\an8}I love their hilarious send-ups
of hit movies.

14
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:32,934
{\an8}-Dad, it's not--
-"Gigabytes."

15
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,679
{\an8}(laughing)
They've done it again.

16
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,642
{\an8}"Gigabytes." Wait, this isn't <i>Weird.</i>

17
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,353
{\an8}Why, there's no magazine
called <i>Weird, </i>is there?

18
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:45,314
{\an8}This is <i>Wired. </i>It's about
computers and technology.

19
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:50,611
{\an8}Hey, look. There's a cybercafe opening
right here in Springfield.

20
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,283
{\an8}Will you take me, Dad? Please?

21
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,572
{\an8}I'll show you how to order pizza
over the internet.

22
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,236
{\an8}The internet? Is that thing still around?

23
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,155
{\an8}I know a web site
that shows monkeys doin' it.

24
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,964
{\an8}Bart, the internet is more than
a global pornography network.

25
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:02,998
{\an8}-It's a--

{\an8}Ach. Let's see what's been captured

{\an8}(beeps, whirs)

30
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,850
{\an8}Ew. This lass needs
a bit of grounds keeping.

00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,772
{\an8}Eh? Aah! That's Willie!

32
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,650
{\an8}My name is Mary.

33
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:28,978
{\an8}I'm 45, heavy, and willing
to settle for less.

34
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,694
{\an8}Wow. This Mary's got the whole package.

35
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,905
{\an8}Wow, Dad. You're surfin' like a pro.

36
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,659
{\an8}Oh, yeah. I'm betting on jai alai
in the Cayman Islands.

37
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,162
{\an8}I invested in something called News Corp--

38
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,865
{\an8}-Dad! That's Fox!
-(screams)

39
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,115
{\an8}Undo! Undo!
(groans)

40
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,077
{\an8}Dad, do we have any money left?

41
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,878
{\an8}Well, let's check the old bank account.

42
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,802
{\an8}See? Even after my cyber squandering,

43
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,382
{\an8}we've still got $1,200.

44
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,637
{\an8}-All right, dorks, this is a holdup.

47
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,901
Yoink dot adios, back-slash losers.

(groans)

49
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,362
MARGE: We were robbed?

50
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:16,912
You seem to know an awful lot about this
for an innocent person.

51
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:20,158
We were saving that money
for our family vacation.

52
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,831
Now we're gonna have
to start all over again.

53
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:23,831
(groans)

54
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,832
Aw, don't worry, sweetheart.

55
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,424
I'll get us the money,

56
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,668
even if I have to get a second job.

57
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,684
Evenin', neighbor. Low on funds again?

58
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,762
Yes, sir.

59
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,216
Now, Homer, we can't
have you burglarizing us

60
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,137
every time you got a bill to pay.

61
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,346
I know, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

62
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,516
It's just that you and Maude
live like royalty in your fancy castle

63
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:57,028
while I got Marge trapped over there
like a pig in a mud beehive.

64
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,781
Oh, we're... we're not
as well off as you think.

65
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,334
We give to eight different churches
just to hedge our bets,

66
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,248
and the Leftorium's business
has gone way downhill

67
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,248
since Leftopolis moved in next door.

68
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,330
If you're not rich, then how come
you have a new refrigerator,

69
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,536
an electric can opener,
a milk shake machine?

70
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,457
(chuckling)
We picked those up cheap.

71
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,915
They were evidence at a murder trial.

72
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,085
Sweet.

73
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,223
We got that tip at the Chuck Garabedian
Mega-Savings Seminar.

74
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,391
Go on.

75
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,759
He taught us how to live
a Burt Reynolds lifestyle

76
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,216
on a Mac Davis income.

77
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,226
We've already got tickets
for his next seminar.

78
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:30,768
I think you'll find living thrifty
a lot more satisfying than stealing.

79
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,063
Maybe you're right, Ned.

80
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,607
Maybe you're right.

81
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,289
Are you tired of missing out
on the good things in life,

82
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:50,289
family vacations, jet packs,
solid gold dancers?

83
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,463
There's only three left in the world.

84
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,922
Well, stick around,
'cause I'm gonna tell you

85
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,423
the 12 savings secrets
Wall Street won't tell you.

86
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,796
Then I'll show you the three ways
to get back to the highway,

87
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:06,354
including one shortcut those Wall Street
fat cats don't want you to know.

88
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,851
(cheering)

89
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,852
Oh, here we go with the fat-cat bashing.

90
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:14,935
Well, what do you expect?
These yokels are pure Baltic Avenue.

91
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,983
(chuckles) Uh-oh! I'm late
for the short line railroad.

92
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,072
(tires squeal)

93
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,664
Let's start with mega secret number one:

94
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,490
"ya gotta squeeze every penny."

95
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,866
You see this tux? I got it cheap
'cause Roy Cohn died in it.

96
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:30,964
(murmuring)

97
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,169
That fancy yacht?

98
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,668
A bargain, 'cause it smells like cat pee.

99
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,591
(murmuring)

100
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,299
And those beautiful women?

101
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,459
They used to be men.

102
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,467
(groaning)

103
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:44,388
The point is,
ya gotta squeeze every penny.

104
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,299
Come on, let me hear you.

105
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,256
TOGETHER: Squeeze every penny.

106
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,347
Squeeze every penny.

107
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,442
I'm squeezing. I'm squeezing it.

108
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,688
Hey, I squeezed so hard
it went into my hand.

109
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,860
Oh, Homer, not again.

110
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:06,488
Ew. We're gonna do our grocery shopping
at a 99 cent store?

111
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,994
Well, maybe for your wedding.

112
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,203
BART: How about here?

113
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,246
Not if we want that vacation.

114
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,710
Look, Mom. They have your dress.

115
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,837
(groans)

116
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,383
Thirty-three cents?

117
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,256
I paid almost double that.

118
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,385
Blue?

119
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,061
Wow! This plankton's only 33 cents.

120
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,810
According to the Mexican Council of Food,

121
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,654
this expired two years ago.

122
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,019
Sure, by their standards,
but we live in America.

123
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,648
(chomping, groaning)

124
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,065
This also says it can cause
red tide poisoning.

125
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,405
But it's so cheap.

126
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,908
Well, let's see what's
in the old vacation fund.

127
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,134
Homer, you could have
just unscrewed the bottom.

128
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,038
A little late for "could-haves," Marge.

129
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,667
I don't think there's enough here
for a vacation.

130
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,054
There is for a mega-savings vacation.

131
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,973
Chuck Garabedian says
you can fly mega cheap

132
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,682
if you don't care where you go.

133
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,972
That's right. Just go to the airport
and wait for some no-shows.

134
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,727
Then you can buy their seats
for a fraction of the price.

135
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,770
Are you going through our garbage?

136
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:21,024
That's right. You fat cats
didn't finish your plankton.

137
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,437
Now it's mine.

138
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,282
Hawaii, here we come.

139
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,025
No. No. We're going to Paris.
I can feel it.

140
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,248
Come on, Transylvania.

141
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,618
{\an8}(Jamaican accent) No, mon,
let's go home to Jamaica.

142
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,956
{\an8}I and I been in Babylon too long.

143
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,711
WOMAN (on PA): <i>Attention.</i>
<i>Flight 605 to Tokyo</i>

144
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,174
<i>is ready for departure</i>

145
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,424
<i>and has four available mega-saver seats.</i>

146
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,966
-BART AND LISA: Yeah!
-Come on, Homer. Japan.

147
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,340
No, not Japan, Jamaica.

148
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,178
I want to pass the dutchie
on the left-hand side.

149
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:57,104
Never mind. Looks like the Flanders
are gonna get those seats anyway.

150
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,312
Oh, so Flanders thinks
he can steal our vacation, huh?

151
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,900
-(groans)
-Come on!

152
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,113
Whoo!

153
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,324
(horn honking)

154
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,201
<i>Sayonara, </i>suckers.

155
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,451
(snarls)

156
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:15,292
Yay! The Simpsons are going to Japan.

157
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,699
(gong sounds)

158
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,327
Hey, watch the gong, jerk.

159
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,967
Come on, Homer. Japan will be fun.

160
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,510
You liked <i>Rashomon.</i>

161
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,303
That's not how I remember it.

162
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,426
Besides, if we wanna see Japanese people,

163
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,814
we could have gone to the zoo.

164
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,680
-Homer!
-What?

165
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,387
The guy who washes
the elephants is Japanese.

166
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,978
His name is Takashi.

167
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,363
He's in my book club.

168
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,689
Look, Mom. The safety instructions
are written in Haiku.

169
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,816
"Fasten seat belts tight.

170
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,073
Your seat cushions float gently.

171
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,865
Headsets, five dollars."

172
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,156
(beeping)

173
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,825
Sir, it is not safe
to use electronic devices yet.

174
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:01,865
You're the waitress.

175
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,707
ATTENDANT: Turn it back on!
Turn it back on!

176
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:12,085
Ooh. I never knew Jim Belushi
made so many movies.

177
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,256
Yeah, isn't it amazing?

178
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,305
They're filming one
right now in the bathroom.

179
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,849
Gonna be on towards the end of the flight.

180
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:23,354
Toga! Toga! Toga 2,000!

181
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,897
Marge, they stole my idea.

182
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,778
MAN (on PA):
<i>Welcome to Japan, folks.</i>

183
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,859
<i>The local time is... tomorrow.</i>

184
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,950
HOMER: Here's our room.

185
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:43,294
Homer, you're supposed
to slide those doors open.

186
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,084
I don't have time for that.

187
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,457
(grunts)

188
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,508
MALE VOICE: <i>Welcome.</i>
<i>I am honored to accept your waste.</i>

189
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,931
(beeps, bells chiming)

190
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,812
(gasps)
They're years ahead of us.

191
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,810
Mom! Lise! Check it out. Dad's on TV.

192
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,521
Oh, yeah!

193
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,766
(Marge, Bart, Lisa screaming)

194
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,606
(gasps)
It's breathtaking.

195
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,065
Look. There's the Imperial Gardens.

196
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,906
The Meiji Shrine.

197
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,081
The Hello Kitty factory.

198
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,000
(cats yowling)

199
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,000
Who's up for some exploring?

200
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,093
Hey, I'm still checking out Japanese TV.

201
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,419
Isn't this that cartoon
that causes seizures?

202
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,844
(beeping)

203
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:36,433
(grunting, groaning)

204
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,720
-Bart, what are you doing?
-(grunting, groaning)

205
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:42,274
Hey, what the...
(grunting, groaning)

206
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,730
Hmm. All right.

207
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,809
(grunting, groaning)

208
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,936
<i>Robots be right back.</i>

209
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,612
-(cow mooing)
-Whoo!

210
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,730
-All that seizing made me hungry.
-Me too.

211
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,237
Let's go to an authentic
Japanese noodle house.

212
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,860
The toilet recommended
a place called Americatown.

213
00:10:56,947 --> 00:11:01,367
Dad, we didn't come halfway
around the world to eat at Americatown.

214
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,832
I'd like to see the Japanese take
on the club sandwich.

215
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,674
I bet it's smaller and more efficient.

216
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,630
MAN (on TV): <i>We now return</i>
<i>to battling seizure robots.</i>

217
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:14,341
-(beeping)
-(all groaning)

218
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,635
(mechanical clicking)

219
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,523
I can't believe they stuck us
at "Tax-A-Chusetts."

220
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,151
Hey, you know, I once knew
a man from Nantucket.

221
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,610
-And?
-Let's just say

222
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,190
the stories about him
are greatly exaggerated.

223
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,026
Howdy, gangstas.

224
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,162
I am average American Joe
salary-man waiter.

225
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,700
These prices suck.
10,000 yen for coleslaw?

226
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:46,035
Don't you serve anything
that's even remotely Japanese?

227
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,542
Don't ask me. I don't know anything.

228
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,174
I am product of American education system.

229
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:56,132
I also build poor-quality cars
and inferior-style electronics.

230
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,835
(laughs)

231
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,545
Oh, they got our number.

232
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,184
One square watermelon, please.

233
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,886
Oh, my goodness. Homer, those are $150.

234
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,938
It's worth every cent.

235
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,191
I'm tired of fumbling with round fruit.

236
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,534
D'oh!

237
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,568
Well, maybe we should
just head back to the hotel.

238
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,163
But you promised me
we'd do something Japanese.

239
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,119
Oh, of course you're right.

240
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,079
You know, I read about a Shinto teahouse

241
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,251
where they practice the traditional...

242
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,749
Run, Bart!

243
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,579
Hey, look, isn't that Woody Allen?

244
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,707
Hmm. Looks like he's doing a commercial.

245
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,417
Oh! (clears throat) Hello.

246
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,375
(clears throat) So many rice crackers
claim to be low-cal,

247
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:43,887
but only Fujikawa Rice Crackers
make your interiors go bananas.

248
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,351
What did I do to deserve this?

249
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,522
Oh, right.

250
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:57,492
Mmm. Fifty-dollar pretzels.

251
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,858
Hey, what's Baby Huey doin'?

252
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,914
Says here they throw salt
before they wrestle to purify the ring.

253
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:02,909
Hmm.

254
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,785
Spare some salt, tubby?

255
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:06,828
{\an8}Tubby?

256
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,661
{\an8}(speaking in Japanese)

257
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,842
-Yoink.
-Hey, that's mine!

258
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,089
(yells)
Hey.

259
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,549
-(grunts)
-(crowd groans)

260
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,091
Like we say in my county,
<i>"hasta la vista, </i>baby."

261
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,636
Congratulations.

262
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,059
I am the emperor.

263
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,138
Yeah? And I'm "Clobbersaurus."

264
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,644
(screaming)

265
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,976
-(gasping, sighing)
-(crowd exclaiming)

266
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,360
All hail Emperor Clobbersaurus.

267
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,321
(booing)

268
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,584
Your wife has paid your bail,
Mr. Simpson-san.

269
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,422
Thank god. Couldn't take
another minute in this hellhole.

270
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,336
(chomping)

271
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,260
Now can we do something Japanese?

272
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,394
Oh, I'm sick of doing Japanese stuff.

273
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,521
In jail, we had to be
in this dumb Kabuki play

274
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,389
about the 47 Ronin

275
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,186
and I wanted to be Yoshi,
but they made me Ori.

276
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,061
Then we had to do two hours of origami

277
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,357
followed by flower arranging
and meditation.

278
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,401
{\an8}(speaking in Japanese)

279
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,370
Honey, I know you want to see Japan,

280
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,698
but we're down to our last million yen.

281
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,124
Don't worry, <i>ichiban.</i>

282
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,413
I'll show you something Japanese.

283
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,085
Oh, it's beautiful, Dad.

284
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,499
It's a crane.

285
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,508
The Japanese believe they bring good luck.

286
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:47,051
Oh, be careful.
We need that money to get home.

287
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,216
(Marge gasps)
No!

288
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,814
{\an8}(speaking in Japanese)

289
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,648
MAN: Now, Mr. Simpson, I know you lost
all your money, but don't worry.

290
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,860
The United States will not stand idly by

291
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,821
while one of its citizens
is stuck here like this.

292
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,243
(grunts, groans)

293
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,742
But, Mr. Ambassador,
how are we going to get home?

294
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,155
Beats me.

295
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,293
Try getting a job and earning some money.

296
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,710
That's what I did.

297
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:15,788
By the way, "ambassador" is taken.

298
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,340
(groaning)

299
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,673
Every truckload of fish we gut

300
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,968
brings us 31 cents closer
to those tickets home.

301
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,433
And I think I finally found what I was put
on this Earth to do.

302
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,944
Knife goes in, guts come out.
Knife goes in, guts come out.

303
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,058
Spare my life and I will
grant you three wi--

304
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,766
-(screams)
-Knife goes in, guts come out.

305
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:44,146
Yippee! Time for the company loyalty song.

306
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:47,204
<i>♪ Knife goes in, guts come out ♪</i>

307
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,569
<i>♪ That's what Osaka Seafood Concern</i>
<i>is all about ♪</i>

308
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,988
(groans)

309
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,118
Well, this sucks. What else is on?

310
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,496
-(bell ringing)
-(cheering)

311
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,343
(laughs)
Thank you.

312
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,298
You have fulfilled our dreams
and dreams of our ancestors.

313
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,920
MALE ANNOUNCER: <i>Tune in tomorrow,</i>
<i>when another lucky family</i>

314
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,627
<i>tries to win their dreams on</i>

315
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,887
Happy Smile Super Challenge
Family Wish Show.

316
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,561
Family Wish Show. Hmm.

317
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,521
That gives me an idea.

318
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,771
I think we all had that idea.

319
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,943
I didn't. What is it? Lunch?

320
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,490
(audience cheering, applauding)

321
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,204
Thank you, thank you.

322
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,740
And welcome to our contestants
from America, the Simpson family.

323
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,367
You honor us.

324
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,163
Don't patronize me.

325
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,957
Now, Simpson family,
have you picked a wish?

326
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,802
Well, I haven't talked it over
with the family,

327
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:48,258
but I think we'd all like
a free dinner at Americatown.

328
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,430
No, no, no. We want plane tickets
home to Springfield.

329
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,641
(cheering, whistling)

330
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:58,812
Now, our game shows are
a little different from yours.

331
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,192
Your shows reward knowledge.

332
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,230
We punish ignorance.

333
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,443
Ignor-what?
(screams)

334
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,864
(laughing)

335
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:10,072
Okay, let's begin. Our categories are:

336
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,784
"Ow. That Hurts."

337
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,574
"Why Are You Doing This to Me?"

338
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,157
and "Please Let Me Die."

339
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,542
BART: Oh, yeah, number one. Definitely.

340
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,790
MARGE: I don't know...

341
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,122
HOMER: "Ow. That hurts."

342
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,536
We'll go with "Ow. That hurts," Skip.

343
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,705
My name is Wink.

344
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,214
Yeesh!

345
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,416
(laughing, chattering)

346
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,723
All right, Simpsons, whack the <i>pinata.</i>

347
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,183
-(groaning)
-Come on!

348
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,473
Whack that pig open. Once more.

349
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,557
Harder. Whack it open.

350
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,062
-(laughing)
-HOST: Good.

351
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,484
All right.

352
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,612
You may remove your blindfolds.

353
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:46,729
(groaning)

354
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,685
Oh, sorry, Dad. We didn't know.

355
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,687
I had an inkling.

356
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,778
Could someone please whack
my hernia back in?

357
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:53,913
Sure thing, Dad.

358
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,159
Mr. Simpson, we'll cut you down

359
00:17:56,241 --> 00:18:00,411
as soon as you answer
one question about Japan.

360
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,616
Is the answer "Japan"?

361
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,214
Actually, it is.

362
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,921
(speaking in Japanese)

363
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,922
That means you move on
to the lightning round.

364
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,005
Oh!

365
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,131
(thunder rumbling)

366
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,258
(screams)

367
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,644
He seems okay,

368
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,430
but he is being burned internally.

369
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,425
(applauding, whistling)

370
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,558
(screaming)

371
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,645
Hey, isn't that Homer
on the Japanese channel?

372
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,861
If that's Homer, then who the hell's been
puttin' beers on his tab?

373
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,859
D'oh. Whoo-hoo.

374
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,737
Uh... that boy ain't right.

375
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,044
HOST: Congratulations, Simpsons.

376
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,160
The airline tickets are yours.

377
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,827
All you have to do is to pick them up...

378
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,749
from inside that volcano.

379
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,627
Why are you so cruel?

380
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,633
(laughing)

381
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,264
(all grunting)

382
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,393
This vacation really blows.

383
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,510
Well, at least we're past
the lightning round.

384
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,557
(screams)
Hmm. I see.

385
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,402
I sure hope they don't have
an ice cream round.

386
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,688
(screams)

387
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:15,026
Mmm. I don't think that bridge
can support much weight.

388
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,656
Well, Maggie weighs a lot less than--
Oh, I'll just go.

389
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,874
(whimpering)

390
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:27,964
(chanting) Plummet! Plummet!
Plummet! Plummet!

391
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,961
-Plummet! Plummet! Plummet!
-Easy, easy...

392
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,344
Yes! Got 'em.

393
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,722
TOGETHER: USA! USA!

394
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,760
-US--
-(buzzes)

395
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,433
(screams, grunts)

396
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,346
(gasps)
Lisa!

397
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,900
-(screams)
-(grunts)

398
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,944
MARGE: Oh!

399
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,534
Marge! Your shoe!

400
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,695
MARGE AND LISA: Aah! Aah! Aah!

401
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,278
The plane tickets!
(grunting)

402
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,374
-MARGE: Oh!
-LISA: Ow!

403
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,868
Whoa! Whoa!

404
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,870
Oh, I'm afraid this might be the end.

405
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,787
Well, at least we'll die
doing what we love...

406
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,377
inhaling molten rock.

407
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,632
(all screaming)

408
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,255
(cheering)

409
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:22,472
(screams)
It burns! It burns!

410
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:26,484
Don't worry, that "lava" is just orangeade

411
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,268
made by our sponsor,
Osaka Orangeade Concern.

412
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,194
It burns! It burns!

413
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,362
It's loaded with wasabi.

414
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:38,111
Kudos, Simpsons.
You have won your freedom.

415
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,485
(audience cheering)

416
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,238
Before I go, I want to say something.

417
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,247
Game shows aren't about cruelty.

418
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,869
They're about greed and wonderful prizes,

419
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,747
like poorly built catamarans.

420
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,303
But somewhere along the line,
you lost your way.

421
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,299
For shame.

422
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,760
(groaning)

423
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,683
Coming up next, a Canadian couple

424
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,350
who say they are
deathly afraid of scorpions.

425
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,600
(applause and whistling)

426
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,393
Oh, that stings, eh.

427
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,226
-(screams)
-Ooh, god! Ow! Ooh!

428
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,402
-(screaming)
-Sting those Canucks.

429
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,944
(laughs)
I love this show.

430
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,435
Take that, you stupid hosers.

431
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,607
(groans)

432
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,494
BART: Good-bye, Japan.

433
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,201
I'll miss your Kentucky Fried Chicken

434
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,582
and your sparkling, whale-free seas.

435
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,449
-Hey, what's goin' on?
-What's happening?

436
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,446
(beeping)

437
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,498
MAN (on PA): <i>Folks, we're experiencing</i>

438
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,211
<i>some moderate Godzilla-related</i>
<i>turbulence at this time,</i>

439
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,713
<i>-so I'm gonna go ahead and ask you...</i>
-(screeches)

440
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,174
<i>...to put your seat belts back on.</i>

441
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,514
<i>When we get to 35,000 feet,</i>
<i>he usually does let go.</i>

442
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,260
<i>So from there on out, all we have to do</i>

443
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,682
<i>-is worry about Mothra...</i>
-(yawning)

444
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,510
<i>...and we do have reports he's tied up</i>

445
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,715
<i>with Gamera and Rodan at the present time.</i>

446
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,016
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

447
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,389
(roaring, screeching)

448
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,273
(Godzilla screeches)

449
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,243
