00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:12,632
to that awesome
family of yours?

349
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,595
What are you crying about?

350
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,096
How cool they are?

351
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,686
Oh. l know
you're sad now.

352
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:28,064
But surely your
incredible family
will cheer you up.

353
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,608
(CONTlNUES SOBBlNG)

354
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,613
Wait. Do you even
have a family?

355
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:38,700
No, l don't!
They're imaginary,
like your brain !

356
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,869
l understand.

357
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,038
You don't
understand anything !

359
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,876
You're such a psycho!

360
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,419
Mama's boy!

361
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,046
Future skank!

362
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,297
Family guy!

363
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,968
Well, well, well,
if it isn't Punch 'n' Juvie.

364
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,596
Plant the evidence
on 'em, boys.

365
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,223
Chief, we don't have to.

366
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:02,557
These ones are
actually guilty.

367
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,642
Super.

368
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,310
Makes our job
that much easier.

369
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:11,691
Oh, Bart, my troubled
little lamb.

370
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,486
You'll be in jail
for so long.

371
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,490
But l'll keep your room
just the way it was,
a pigsty.

372
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,827
Son, l want you to know
no matter what anyone says,

373
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,579
there's no shame
in being caught alive.

374
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:28,166
Take a good long look
at the innocent love
in your son's eyes.

375
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:31,378
Because when he
gets out of prison,
it'll be gone forever.

376
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,839
He will have
a great bod though.

377
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,925
And a couple of
those teardrop tattoos.
Those are cool.

378
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,095
There's something l
have to tell you guys.

379
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:42,889
Now, look, my fly
is down because
it's broken, okay?

380
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,100
No. lt's something else.

381
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,355
Bart, she took all
the responsibility
for the escape.

382
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,481
You're free to go.

383
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,233
But the kid's still got time
on his sentence, Chief.

384
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,194
Look, if you all
want to squeeze into
the backseat, fine.

385
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,529
With my box kite.

386
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,822
Oh, forget it.

387
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,546
Welcome back, Gina.
l got a few new
cellmates for you.

388
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,381
That's cool.

389
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,050
l wouldn't feel right
going to the bathroom
with no one watching.

391
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:27,267
l thought you might want
to have a nice family dinner.

392
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,978
We're having
"Make Your Own Taco" night.

393
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:34,733
Gina, thanks for showing us
the meaning of Christmas.

394
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:38,278
And thanks for showing
my brother that girls
can be cool.

395
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,821
Who is this nerd?

396
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,323
Taco, please.

397
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,659
Well, my shift's over.

398
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:49,164
l guess it's back to
my bachelor apartment,
make a tuna sandwich,

399
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,959
turn on WiII & Grace
and cry myself to sleep.
