00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,242
{\an8}a 35-year-old
Springfieldite

8
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,457
{\an8}who's earned everything
the hard way

00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,578
{\an8}but never let adversity
get him down.

10

{\an8}<i>Abandoned by his parents</i>
<i>at age four,</i>

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,880
{\an8}<i>Frank never got to go</i>
<i>to school.</i>

12
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,882
{\an8}<i>He spent his childhood years</i>
<i>as a delivery boy</i>

13
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:52,635
{\an8}<i>delivering toys</i>
<i>to more fortunate children.</i>

14
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,179
{\an8}<i>Then, on his 18th birthday</i>

15
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,683
{\an8}<i>he was blown up</i>
<i>in a silo explosion.</i>

16
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,314
{\an8}<i>During his long recuperation</i>

17
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,154
{\an8}<i>he taught himself to hear</i>

{\an8}<i>As the years passed</i>

19

{\an8}That's the kind of man I need

28
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:34,005
{\an8}A real scrapper--
a self-made man like me.

{\an8}Bring this
Grimes fellow to me.

30
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,392
{\an8}I want to make him

00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,394
Yes, sir.

32
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,272
Smithers,
I've just seen

33
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,185
the most heroic dog
on television.

34
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,113
He pulled a toddler from
the path of a speeding car

35
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,693
then pushed a criminal
in front of it.

36
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,068
Find this dog.

37
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,874
I want to make him
my executive vice president.

38
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,579
Uh, yes, sir.

39
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,159
I-In the meantime,
here's Frank Grimes.

00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,078
The-- The self-made man?

41
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,626
What? Oh, yes, that fellow.

42
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,250
Oh, just put him somewhere
out of the way

43
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,837
and find that dog!

44
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,552
Yes, sir.

45
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,932
Ahh.

00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:17,548
Chair goes round,
chair goes round...

47
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,007
Hey, Homey,
you busy?

48
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,467
Yes.

49
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,097
Hey, there's a new guy
at the plant.

50
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,813
Maybe we ought to say
"hi" to him.

51
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,403
I don't know.

52
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,018
I'm kind of dizzy.

53
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,815
I should probably go home sick.

54
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,436
Hm. Hmm.

55
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,437
Mm-hm.

56
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,448

59
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,713
Yes. My name is Frank Grimes.

60
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,119
I'm Lenny.

61
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,747
This is Carl and Homer.

62
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,594
-I'm Lenny.
-How do you do?

63
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,339
Wow. You got pencils
with your name on 'em

64
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,012
just like a pencil
company executive.

65
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,051
I'd give anything
for one of these.

66
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,755
Any office supply company
can have them made up for you.

67
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,506
-Can I have this one?
-No.

68
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,178
-Can Lenny have it?
-No.

69
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,807
Oh, that's my degree
in nuclear physics.

70
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,345
I'm sure you all have one.

71
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,978
Oh, yeah. Carl and I
each have a master's.

72
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,025
'Course old Homer,
he didn't need a degree.

73
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,609
He showed up the day
they opened the plant.

74
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,105
I didn't even know what
a nuclear panner plant was.

75
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,158
Um...

76
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,370
(chuckles)

77
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,200
Yeah. Well, listen,

78
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,745
I'm sure we all have
a lot of work to do.

79
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,039
BOTH: Hm.

80
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,753
Hey, you seem like a great guy,
so I'll give you a little tip:

81
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,666
If you turn that
security camera around,

82
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,215
you can sleep,
and no one will ever know.

83
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,550
Uh, I don't think
we're being paid to sleep.

84
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,056
Oh, yeah, they're always
trying to screw ya.

85
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,812
Huh.

86
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,812
"Marge" is already taken?

87
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,984
Mm, how about "Marjorie?"

88

89
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:54,031
-Oh, sorry, ma'am.
-Mm...

90
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,568
How about... "Mitzi?"

91
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,822
(keyboard rattling)

92
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,073
Uh-uh.
Uh, you can have "Nitzi."

93
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,406
Hmm... "Nitzi..."

94
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,491
I'm outta here.

00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,037
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
our next lot is number 751.

96

97
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,669
Seven-five-one?

98
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,800
Nothing.
No bids for item 751?

99
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,959
A buck!

100
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:16,967

102
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,177
Sold! For a buck.

103
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,768
Cool. What'd I buy?

104
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,352
35 Industry Way.

105
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,569
Looks like my
years of hard work

106
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,994
have finally paid off.

what's the good word?

109
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,787
My name is Grimes,
uh, Simpson.

110
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,420
Frank Grimes. I took the trouble
to learn your name.

111
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,208
The least you can do is...
learn mine.

112
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,382

Okay, Grimy.

113
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,211
Uh, you're eating
my special dietetic lunch.

114
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,298
Huh?

115
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,013
(chuckling)
Oh, gee...

116
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,053
Oh, I'm sorry.

117
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,756
The bag was clearly marked.

118
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,176
Please be more careful
in the future.

119
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,564
Check.

{\an8}Ugh...

124
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,817
Simpson, do you know
who chewed my--

(snaps)

126
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,254
Wow.

127
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,424
It's filthy, and it's mine.

128

So, how's it going,
Grimy?

134
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,607
I-I'd appreciate it

135
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,533
if you'd stay out of
my office, Simpson.

Simpson, you've got

No, a 5-13!

145

In your procedures manual?
A 5-13?

146

You want a job

You don't have a factory.

156
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,594
Hey, I'm a busy man.
You want a job or not?

157
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,585
Okay.

I don't know.
Pigs tend to chew.

161
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,307
I'd say he eats
more like a duck.

162
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,726
Well, some kind
of farm animal, anyway.

163
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,988
And earlier today

164
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,659
I saw him asleep
inside a radiation suit.

165
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,738
(chuckles)
Can you imagine that?

166
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,284
He was hanging
from a coat hook!

167
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,537
He had three beers
at lunch.

168
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,118
That would make
anybody sleepy.

169
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,913
I've never seen him do
any work around here.

170
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,117
W-What is his job?

171
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,206
Safety inspector.

172
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,751
That irresponsible oaf?!

173
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,174
A man who, by all rights

174
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,172
should have been killed
dozens of times by now?

175
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,094
Eh, 316 times,
by my count.

176
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,764
That's the man who's in charge
of our safety?

177
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,223
I-It boggles the mind.

178
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,473
It's best
not to think about it.

179
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,312
(grunts)

180
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,022
You idiot!

181
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,567
You nearly drank a beaker
full of sulfuric acid!

182
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,321
Acid, eh? Gee, that
would have been stupid.

183
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,414
(laughs)

184
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,409
Boy, would my face
have been red.

185
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,451
(laughing)

186
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,622
Stop laughing,
you imbecile!

187
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,206
Don't you realize
how close you just came

188
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,211
to killing yourself?

189
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,803
Who did this to my wall?

190
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:28,882
He did.

191
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,506
Is this true?

192
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,683
I, well, uh, technically
it is true, sir, but--

193
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,143
Come with me.

194
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,438
He likes you.

195
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,940
(barking)

196
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,771
BURNS: How dare you destroy
my valuable wall

197
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,356
and spill my priceless acid?!

198
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,781
Did you think you were
going to get away with it?

199
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,109
-GRIMES: I wasn't--
-BURNS: Silence!

200
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,655
I'm going to give you
one more chance...

201
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,618
at a reduced salary.

202
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,408
So straighten up
and fly right.

203
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,452
GRIMES: But, sir,
if I could--

204
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,195
(barking and growling)

205
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,882
Hi, Grimy, old buddy.

206
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,460
I'm not your
buddy, Simpson!

207
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,455
I don't like you.
In fact, I hate you.

208
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,417
Stay the hell
away from me!

209
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,677
Because from now on...
we're enemies!

210
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,470
Okay.

211
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,644
Do I have to do anything?

212
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,392
(groans)

213
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,936
Oh, I can't believe it.
I got an enemy.

214
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:29,193
Me. The most beloved man
in Springfield.

215
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,317
Ah, it's
a weird world, Homer.

216
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,153
As hard as it is
to believe,

217
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,988
some people don't care
for me neither.

218
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,033
No, I won't
accept that.

219
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,327
No, it's true.

220
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,000
I got their names
written down right here

221
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,788
in what I call
my, uh, enemies list.

222
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:46,002
Jane Fonda, Daniel Shore,
Jack Anderson--

223
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,205
Hey! This is Richard Nixon's
enemies list.

224
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,967
You just crossed out his name
and put yours.

225
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,509
Okay, give me that.
Give me it back.

226
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,054
Barney Gumbel.

227
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,178
Oh.

228
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,644
Oh, what'll
I do, Moe?

229
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,394
Well, why don't you
invite him over to dinner?

230
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,555
Turn him from an enemy
into a friend.

231
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,024
Then, when he's
not expecting it--

232
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,944
Bam! The old fork
in the eye.

233
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:08,984
Do you think
it might work

234
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,686
without the fork
in the eye?

235
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:12,697
There's always
a first time.

236
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,865
This dinner has to go
absolutely perfect

237
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,292
if Grimy and me are
going to be friends.

238
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,871
Lisa, be perfect.

239
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,996
-Okay.
-Marge, perfect.

240
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,133
Bart, perfect.
Other kid, perfect.

241
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,090
I only have five lobsters.
Are you sure

242
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,841
he's not bringing
anyone with him?

243
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,882
No, no. He doesn't know
he's coming to dinner.

244
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,926
I didn't think he'd come,
so I called and said

245
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,890
I have something
really important to tell him

246
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,640
and that I could only
tell him about it here.

247
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,852
-(doorbell rings)
-It's him!

248
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,852
(singsongy) It's him!
It's him! It's him!

249
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,904
Calm down.
Homer, calm down.

250
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,268
Answer the door.

251
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,805
(gasping)

252
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,897
Welcome
to the Simpson residence

253
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,235
or <i>casa de Simpson,</i>
as I call it.

254
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,868
Yeah, what did you want
to see me about, Simpson?

255
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,198
This better
be important.

256
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,583
It is. It is.

257
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,700
But first, let me
introduce you to my family.

258
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,918
My perfect family.

259
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,418
This is my
wife, Marge.

260
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,540
Hello.

261
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,626
HOMER:
And our beautiful baby.

262
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,341
My daughter Lisa
I.Q.-156.

263
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,382
Hi.

264
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,335
HOMER: See, and
my son Bart.

265
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,215
He owns
a factory downtown.

266
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,182
How do you do?
Look, Homer, I'm late

267
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,562
for my night job
at the foundry

268
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,059
so if you don't
mind telling me...

269
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,559
Good heavens!
This is a palace.

270
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,266
How in the world
can you afford to live

271
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,016
in a house like this, Simpson?

272
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,438
I don't know. Don't ask me
how the economy works.

273
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,067
Yeah, but look
at the size of this place.

274
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,664
I live in a single room
above a bowling alley

275
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,580
and below another
bowling alley.

276
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,659
Wow.

277
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,123
I'm sorry, isn't that--

278
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,293
Yeah, that's me
all right.

279
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,961
And the guy
standing next to me

280
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,669
is president Gerald Ford.

281
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,459
And this is
when I was on tour

282
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,963
with the Smashing Pumpkins.

283
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,554
Oh, and here's a picture of me
in outer space.

284
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,720
You... went
into outer space?

285
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,879
You?

286
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,757
Sure.
You've never been?

287
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,385
Would you like to see
my Grammy award?

288
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,101
No! I wouldn't!

289
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,931
God! I've had to work hard
every day of my life

290
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,057
and what do I have
to show for it?

291
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,765
This briefcase
and this haircut!

292
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,146
And what do you have to show

293
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,822
for your lifetime
of sloth and ignorance?

294
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,946
-What?
-Everything!

295
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,989
A dream house, two cars,
a beautiful wife,

296
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,164
a son who owns a factory,
fancy clothes, and--

297
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,294
(sniffing)

298
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,960
Lobsters for dinner!

299
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,998
And do you
deserve any of it?

300
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,172
No!

301
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,420
(gasps)
What are you saying?

302
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,383
I'm saying,
you're what's wrong

303
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,094
with America,
Simpson.

304
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,434
You coast
through life.

305
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,968
You do as little
as possible

306
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,761
and you leach off decent

307
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,345
hardworking people
like me.

308
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,101
If you lived in any other
country in the world,

309
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,063
you would have
starved to death long ago.

310
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,023
He's got you there, Dad.

311
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,313
You're a fraud.

312
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,066
A total fraud.

313
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,319
It was nice
meeting you.

314
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,780
(door slams)

315
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,332
MILHOUSE:
Wow... adding machines.

316
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,582
Industrial waste.

317
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,004
What should we do
with all this stuff, Bart?

318
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,923
I think we both know
the answer to that.

319
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,764
(sighs)

320
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:26,966
(knocking)

321
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,216
<i>Get to work.</i>

322
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,387
(stairs squeaking)

323
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,016
BOTH: Wacky shack!

324
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,773
Better be
careful, Bart.

325
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,725
Look at those
warning signs.

326
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,284
Solve your problem,
Milhouse?

327
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,822
Yup.

328
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:43,905
(stairs squeaking)

329
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,332
Hm?

330
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:53,865
(knocking)

331
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,038
Homer.

332
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,035
Homer, why aren't
you at work?

333
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,877
The car won't start.

334
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,763
I don't feel
very good today.

335
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,800
I am at work.

336
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,262
You're afraid to go to work

337
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,432
because Frank Grimes
will be there, aren't you?

338
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,141
That's crazy talk.

339
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,312
You're crazy, Marge.
Get off the road.

340
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,481
(honks horn)

341
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,440
You'll have
to face him sometime,

342
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,310
and when you do,
I'm sure he'll be

343
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,267
just as anxious
to make up as you are.

344
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,317
No, he won't.
He hates me.

345
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,901
He doesn't hate you.

346
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,356
He just feels insecure

347
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,485
because you're getting
through life so easily,

348
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,163
and it's been
so difficult for him.

349
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,372
Yeah. Yeah.
That's his problem.

350
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,662
He's a nut.

351
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,325
It's not about me being lazy.

352
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,785
It's about him
being a crazy nut.

353
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,496
Well... maybe.

354
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,507
But I'll bet
he would be less crazy

355
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,129
if you were just
a little more,

356
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,295
mm...
professional in your work.

357
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,434
(gasps)

358
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,390
Just a little more.

359
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,390
Then he won't have any reason
to resent you.

360
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,313
I'll do it.

361
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,312
To professionalism.

362
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,204
Good morning, fellow employee.

363
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,160
You'll notice that I am now
a model worker.

364
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,331
We should continue
this conversation later

365
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,500
during a designated
break period.

366
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,619
Sincerely,
Homer Simpson.

367
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,576
(beeping)

368
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,882
Can you believe that guy?

369
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,092
He's in his office
making a pathetic attempt

370
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,552
to look professional.

371
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,972
Hey, what do you got
against Homer anyway?

372
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,550
Are you kidding?

373
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,425
Does this whole plant
have some disease

374
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,101
where it can't see
that he's an idiot?

375
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,350
Look here.

376
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,181
Accidents have doubled
every year

377
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,016
since he became
safety inspector.

378
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,351
And meltdowns have tripled.

379
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,146
Has he been fired? No.

380
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,609
Has he been disciplined?
No, no.

381
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,729
Ah, everybody
makes mistakes.

382
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,606
That's why they put
erasers on pencils.

383
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,613
Yeah, Homer's okay.
Give him a break.

384
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,815
No. Homer is not okay.

385
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,986
And I want everyone in this
plant to realize it.

386
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,155
I would die a happy man
if I could prove to you

387
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,623
that Homer Simpson
has the intelligence

388
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,753
of a six year old.

389
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,915
So, how you doing?

390
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,340
(groans)

391
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,758
Hmm?

392
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,718
Uh, here we go.

393
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,146
Mm-hm.

394
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,818
Ahh.

395
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,399
Design your own
power plant, eh?

396
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,445
This is my chance
to show everyone

397
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,199
how professional I am.

398
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,120
Lenny, tell Mr. Burns
I've gone home

399
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,579
to work on the contest.

400
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,580
(chuckling)

401
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,957
Oh, God!

402
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,633
(power tool grinding)

403
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,547
(Homer shouting, indistinct)

404
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,562
Ow!
(shouting)

405
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,269
Can I go downstairs
and see what Dad's doing?

406
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,193
I wouldn't
bother him, honey.

407
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,612
He's making some kind
of model for a contest.

408
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,571
He says it's really
high-tech stuff

409
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,651
that we wouldn't
understand.

410
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,697
Marge, do we have
any elbow macaroni

411
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,200
and glue-on sparkles?

412
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,742
-(banging)
-(grunting)

413
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,167
(whistle blowing)

414
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,578
Oh, boy! Quittin' time!

415
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,881
Just a minute, Van Houten.

416
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,924
Somebody needs to guard
this place tonight

417
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,508
so it doesn't get trashed.

418
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,393
How'd you like to be
night watchman?

419
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,850
But I'm sleepy.

420
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,809
Oh, no <i>problemo.</i>

421
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,970
Here's a nickel
for the coffee machine.

422
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,360
(squeaking)

423
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,621
So this is my life.

424
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,448
At least I've done
better than Dad.

425
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,754
(whistling, gasps)

426
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,119
Aw, geez!

427
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,827
Milhouse, how could you
let this happen?

428
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,957
You were supposed to be
the night watchman.

429
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,094
I was watching.

430
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,920
I saw the whole thing.

431
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,085
First, it started
falling over,

432
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,474
and then it fell over.

433
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,970
Wow.

434
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,972
I wonder where all the rats
are gonna go.

435
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,805
(rats squeaking)

436
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,480
MOE: Okay, everybody,

437
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,231
tuck your pants
into your socks.

438
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,484
And the bold new ideas

439
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,107
these tiny tykes
unveil for us today

440
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:37,235
could make thousands of jobs
like yours obsolete!

441
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,834
(scant applause)

442
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,959
Our first little genius
is Ralph Wiggum.

443
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,750
It's pretty
good, sir.

444
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,551
Hot tub?
Media room?

445
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,300
It's supposed to be
a power plant

446
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,512
not Aunt Beulah's bordello.

447
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,342
Thank you.
Get out.

448
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,887
Next.

449
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,852
WIGGUM: Uh, Ralphy,
get off the stage, sweetheart.

450
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,611
Behold!

451
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:12,989
The power plant
of the future... today!

452
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,358
(moans)

453
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,954
Too cold and sterile.

454
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,159
Where's the heart?

455
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,120
But it really
generates power.

456
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,240
It's lighting this room
right now.

457
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,369
You lose. Get off
my property.

458
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,577
Let's have the next child.

459
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,134
Look, everybody!

460
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,842
Simpson's in a contest
with children!

461
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,222
Hey, shh!

462
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,759
You're making us
miss the contest.

463
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,310
Could you explain
your model, young man?

464
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,558
What's to explain?!

465
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,599
He's an idiot?!

466
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,522
LENNY: Pipe down!

467
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,731
Well, basically,
I just copied the plant we have now.

468
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,192
Mm...

469
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,402
Then, I added some fins
to lower wind resistance.

470
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,363
And this racing stripe here
I feel is pretty sharp.

471
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,695
Agreed.
First prize.

472
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,700
-What?!
-Way to go, Homer!

473
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,372
You're number one, Homer!

474
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,001
But it was a contest
for children!

475
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,158
Yeah, and Homer beat
their brains out!

476
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,827
(cheering)

477
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,126
CROWD: Yeah! Yeah!

478
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,840
I can't stand it any longer.
This whole plant is insane!

479
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,551
Insane, I tell you!

480
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,261
(screams)

481
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,679
I can be lazy, too!

482
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,432
Look at me!

483
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,853
Hi! I'm a worthless employee
just like Homer Simpson!

484
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,194
Give me a promotion!

485
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,863
Ooh, I eat like a slob,
but nobody minds!

486
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,191
(gobbling loudly)

487
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,775
I'm peeing
on the seat!

488
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,203
Give me a raise!

489
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,952
Now I'm returning to work
without washing my hands!

490
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,245
But it doesn't matter

491
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,748
because
I'm Homer Simpson.

492
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,670
I don't need to do my work

493
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,829
'cause someone else
will do it for me.

494
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,458
D-ohh, d-ohh, d-ohh!

495
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,964
Hey, you okay, Grimy?

496
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,416
I'm better than okay.

497
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,546
I'm Homer Simpson.

498
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,432
You wish.

499
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,799
Oh, hi, Mr. Burns.

500
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,215
I'm the worst worker
in the world.

501
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,854
Time to go home
to my mansion

502
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,561
and eat my lobster.

503
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,441
What's this?

504
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,229
"Extremely high voltage."

505
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,562
Well, I don't need
safety gloves

506
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,108
because I'm Homer Simp--

507
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,321
(zapping)

508
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,406
LOVEJOY:
Frank Grimes,

509
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,619
or "Grimy,"
as he liked to be called,

510
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:29,791
taught us that a man
can triumph over adversity.

511
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,461
And even though Frank's

512
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,290
agonizing struggle
through life

513
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,995
was tragically
cut short...

514
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,706
I'm sure he's...

515
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:41,626
(snoring)

516
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,757
Change the channel, Marge.

517
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,854
(laughing)

518
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:46,889
That's our Homer!

519
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,472
(laughing)

520
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,444
Shhh!!
