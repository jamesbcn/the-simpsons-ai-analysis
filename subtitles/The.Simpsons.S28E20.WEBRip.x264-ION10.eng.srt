354
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,280
I'm starting to suspect
that trophy was not real gold.

355
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,150
Can we talk about something else?

356
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,776
Absolutely.

357
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,783
After you put your fingerprints
on this knife.

358
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,985
-Dad!
-It's a cake knife.

359
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,746
I just had an extra piece.
Two extra pieces.

360
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,158
Okay, two extra cakes.

361
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,246

of something bigger.

362
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,422
Just touch the knife.

363
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,710
Dad, why are you making me
hide things from Mom?

364
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,955
You're right. That's my job.

-Forget it.

372
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,859
I learned from Peekimon
that's a slippery slope.

373
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,689
Especially that time
I fell down a slippery slope.

374
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,395
Look, this isn't a stupid game.

375
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,605
I'm looking for a lady

-No.

-No!

00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,543
This is where we used to go.

380
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,539
Bart, what were you up to?

381
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,081
Being the perfect grandson.

383
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,041
No, for everybody but her.

384
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,916
Now please, we got to find Phoebe.

385
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,713
Well, we'll need the help of...

386
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,507
experienced Peekimon searchers.

387
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,931

00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,716
in this forest...

418
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,259
with apparently excellent Wi-Fi.

419
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,553
Uh, yes, all the trees
are cell phone towers.

420
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,428
What are you doing out here?

421
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,805
Oh... I'll-I'll admit
I-I had some dark thoughts

422
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,483
and I used you to escape from the home.

423
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:29,152
But once I got out here by myself,
completely free,

424
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,993
I realized there's so much to live for.

425
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,399
And... I want my camera back.

426
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,868
Can we still hike sometimes?

427
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,119
Yes, and we could go inside

00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,875

446
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,169
Huh, I do feel better.

447
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,920
Hmm, you know,
the last couple of pies I baked

448
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,337
haven't been great.

449
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,965

00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,276

Yes, because I decide how my hair looks.

00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,741
