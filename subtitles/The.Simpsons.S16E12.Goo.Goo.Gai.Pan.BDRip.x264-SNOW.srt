an expression of
utter serenity.

345
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,165
Just think about
the day you found

346
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,288
that Junior Mint in
your belly button.

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,360
A Buddha statue?

350
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,091
We cannot
leave it outside.
It is bad feng shui.

351
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,207
Feng shui?

352
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,361
I thought that
was just a trick

353
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,363
to sell crappy end
tables to the West.

354
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,603

his nostril and pull.

l never
moved a Buddha
this heavy.

359

Let's cut him in
chunks and worship
the chunks.

360
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,520
Ooh!

361
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,684
Now let's see.
Which one is Ling?

362
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,844

the Delta Airlines

they can't get in
without spending
frequent flyer miles.

369

Plus, we get
free apple, orange,
and grape fruit juice.

370
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,006
MADAM WU: I am afraid
that juice is not
on your tongue just yet.

(ALL GASPING)

372

Give the baby back!

373
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,806
I cannot allow
her to be raised
by an unmarried woman!

374
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,329
Madam Wu, I too
work for a cruel
and faceless empire...

375
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,846
The Department
of Motor Vehicles.

376
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,123
May I talk to you,
bureaucrat to bureaucrat?

377
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,282
Yes. But you first
must sign this form.

378
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,521
And initial here.
And here.

379
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,008
Now we must
find a notary.

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,681
(CHUCKLES)
This is Wang Pu's
time to shine!

381
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,487
Proceed.

382
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,202
Madam Wu, we both love
the enforcement
of pointless rules.

383
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,011
But there's
a greater joy in
bending the rules

384
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,050
to help someone
who thinks all
hope is gone.

385
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,482
I was this woman's
husband for a few days,

386
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,846
in name only,

387
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,446
and beer will soon
obliterate that memory,

388
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,488
but I don't think
this baby could find

389
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,207
Any greater love
on your planet
or ours.

390
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,925
You may not
believe this,

391
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,923
but I once was
a baby myself.

392
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,162
My father
was a Ping-Pong
champion.

393
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,284
He died when
the ball got stuck
in his throat.

394
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,842
The Heimlich maneuver
was invented
the very next day.

395
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,403
My mother raised me alone,
so I know it can be done.

396
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,845
You may keep
your baby.

397
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,485
But, you!
Drop the panda!

398
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,085
But he loves me. Ow!

399
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,529

I'll endanger you...

You'll be back
someday, Ling,

403
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,441
as a spoiled
American teenager.

Something's
wrong with Bart.

407
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,241

David Silverman here,
supervising director
of <i>The Simpsons.</i>

415
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,002
And tonight,
I'm gonna show you
how to draw Bart.

416
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,924
Now we start off with
a tin can, like this.

417
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,606
And a little tuna
fish can for the bottom
part of his head.

418
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,920
A little hinge
of an ear.

419
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,451
And a big sausage
for a nose.

420
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,761
Two giant golf
balls for eyes.

421
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,444
Now here's
a trick about the hair.

422
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,526
It's one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine points.

423
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,011
And there you go.
Perfect Barts every time.

424
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,123
Now once you've
mastered how
to draw Bart,

425
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,123
you can put him
in all sorts
of costumes.

426
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,124
Some that he likes,
some that he hates.

427
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,211
Well, that's it,
my friends.

428
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,884
Thank you very much.
Keep watching.
