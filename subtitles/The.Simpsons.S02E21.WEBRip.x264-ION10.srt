00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,135
{\an8}Well, you wanna know
what I think?

19
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,722
{\an8}I think Casper is
the ghost of Richie Rich.

Hey, they do look alike.

{\an8}how hollow the pursuit
of money is,

23
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,226
{\an8}and took his own life.

{\an8}Never punches a bad guy

than the next superhero.

28
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,655
{\an8}Oh, yeah? Look. He knocks
a guy into the sun and says,

"Hot enough for you?"

30
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,123

00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,365

00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,579
We're here!

-Your youthful high spirits

00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:47,632
You might say I feel like
Radiation Man.

48
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,339
-That's "Radioactive Man," jerk.
-(laughing)

49
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,670
I, uh, stand corrected.
Well, have fun and be sure

50
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,087
to clear out by 6
for the Shriners.

51
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,047
Get that punk's name. No one makes
a fool out of Diamond Joe Quimby.

52
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,098
Excuse me, sir.

53
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,602
Has anyone turned in
a left Vulcan ear?

54
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,194
Well, let's see.

55
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,309
We got a utility belt,
a couple of tricorders,

56
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,517
a lightsaber...
Sorry, kid.

57
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:15,398
Mmm-mm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

58
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,026
Mmm. Mm-mmm.

59
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,124
-Hey, Bart dude.
-Hey, Otto man. Ooh, what's that?

60
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,291
My very own idea
for a comic book, little man.

61
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,420
It's about a dude
who drives a school bus by day

62
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:31,838
but by night, fights vampires
in a post-apocalyptic war zone.

63
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,800
-Cool!
-Come on, Bart.

64
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,670
We're going to see Buddy Hodges.

65
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,757
{\an8}-The guy who played Fallout Boy on TV?
-Yep!

66
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,513
{\an8}Wow! I guess he
wasn't killed in Vietnam.

67
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,926
Ahh, these Laramie cigarettes

68
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,306
give me the steady nerves
I need to combat evil.

69
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,104
Gee willickers,
Radioactive Man.

70
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,318
Wished I was old enough
to smoke Laramies.

71
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,648
Sorry, Fallout Boy.

72
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,243
Not until you're 16.
Look out!

73
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,660
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Will Radioactive Man</i>

74
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,448
<i>act in time to save</i>
<i>the Earth?</i>

75
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,081
(kids cheering)

76
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,619
Well, wasn't that great?

77
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,873
You know kids, I'm sure we'd all like
to remember actor Dirk Richter

78
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,627
for his portrayal
of Radioactive Man

79
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,959
and not the sordid details
of his final years,

80
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,166
so let's keep the questions
tasteful, okay?

81
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,967
Now, how about a big welcome
for Buddy "Fallout Boy" Hodges!

82
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,892
-(kids cheering)
-Any questions?

83
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,523
When Radioactive Man got injected
with shrinking serum in issue 234,

84
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,271
how come his costume
shrinks too?

85
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,063
I'm sure I don't know,

86
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,646
but I did just finish playing
Rum Tum Tugger

87
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,532
in the second national
touring company of <i>Cats.</i>

88
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,439
-Anybody see it?
-Oh, oh, over here!

89
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,158
-Fallout Boy! Me, me me!
-Yes, you. The masked boy.

90
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,739
Do you think the ghost of Dirk Richter
haunts the bordello

91
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,825
where his bullet-riddled body
was found?

92
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,710
(crying) Dirk Richter
was a beautiful man.

93
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,668
Can't you little vultures
leave him alone?!

94
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,209
(sobbing)

95
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:59,298
Hey! Radioactive Man #72!

96
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,132
It's an imaginary tale

97
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,427
where Radioactive Man
marries Larva Girl.

98
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,851
BART:
Wow, number nine!

99
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,720
That's before Fallout Boy
became his ward.

100
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,230
Tell you what. I'll show you
something very special

101
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,902
if you promise to put your grubby little
hands behind your back and keep 'em there.

102
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,732
-Behold!
-Wow!

103
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,947
<i>Radioactive Man</i>
<i>Number One.</i>

104
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,279
-None other.
-I bet it's worth a million bucks.

105
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,874
It is, my lad. But I'll let you have it
for 100, because you remind me of me.

106
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,951
-Oh, all I got is 30.
-Then you cannot have it.

107
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,908
But I must.
Until this moment,

108
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,498
I never knew why God
put me on this Earth,

109
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:37,053
but now I know--
to buy that comic book.

110
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,758
Your emotion is
out of place here, son.

111
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,716
(horns honking)

112
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,760
So, did you kids have fun?

113
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,764
Yeah Mom. Guess what? For a dollar,
a man sold me 35 Caspers

114
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,847
and a dozen Lois Lanes.

115
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,772
-Ooh.
-I never knew what Superman saw in her.

116
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,562
Give me Wonder Woman!
(lecherous growl)

117
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:59,276
And that golden lariat--
she can tie me up anytime.

118
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,359
(barking and howling)

119
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,526
-Homer!
-I was just kidding, Marge.

120
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:09,945
Hey! What does everyone say
to dinner at Krusty Burgers?

121
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,696
(cheering)
My treat.

122
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,998
Alright Homer!
Woah, you really are a sport, Dad,

123
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,752
taking us out to a fine restaurant
like Krusty Burger.

124
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,384
Alright, what are you
getting at?

125
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,551
I need $100
for a comic book.

126
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,590
100 bucks? For a comic book?
Who drew it, Michael Malangelo?

127
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,594
Oh, please, Dad. I want this more
than anything in the world.

128
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,547
Well, T.S.

129
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:33,678
-Please, Dad.
-No.

130
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,518
-Please, Dad.
-No. No!

131
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,193
Now look, son.
We all know that,

132
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,571
usually, when you bug me
like this, I give in,

133
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,529
so I'm not mad at you
for trying--

134
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,439
shows you've been
paying attention--

135
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,448
but we all know
I'm not gonna give you $100.

136
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,321
-Now, are you going to stop bugging me?
-No.

137
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,698
-Are you?
-No.

138
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,366
-Are you?
-No. No.

139
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,414
Okay!

140
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,117
Hee-hee! I win!

141
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,827
In your face!

142
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,707
Yeah! How do you
like them apples?

143
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:03,174
-Hoo-hoo! (laughing)
-Don't gloat, Homer.

144
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,916
You know, Bart,
when I was your age,

145
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,837
the one thing I wanted more
than anything in the world

146
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,346
was a child-size,
electric-light bulb oven.

147
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,259
My parents wouldn't
give me the money,

148
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,677
<i>so I went to my sisters,</i>
<i>Patty and Selma.</i>

149
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,806
We'll give you
half our allowance.

150
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,693
Uh-huh, but you have
to be our slave.

151
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,440
-Okay.
-This gives us a lot more free time.

152
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,823
Uh-huh!
Let's take up smoking.

153
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,030
MARGE:
<i>For months I worked and worked</i>

154
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,281

<i>smoked and smoked.</i>

<i>all those lightbulb-warmed treats</i>

<i>I didn't realize it</i>
<i>at the time,</i>

170
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,282
<i>but a little piece</i>
<i>of my childhood</i>

171
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,912
<i>had slipped away forever.</i>

172
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,369
-Bart! What are you staring at?
-Uh... nothing.

173
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,660
<i>He didn't say it, and neither did I,</i>
<i>but at that moment,</i>

174
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,615
<i>my Dad and I were closer</i>
<i>than we've ever--</i>

175
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,205
-Bart! Stop it.
-Sorry.

176
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,001
<i>♪ To everything... ♪</i>

177
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,090
<i>♪ I need some money... ♪</i>

178
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,222
<i>♪ A lot of money... ♪</i>

179
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,088
Ah!

180
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,465
Empty bottles, empty bottles.

181
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,012
Hmm. Well, it's practically
empty.

182
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,516
Here you go, Apu.

183
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,768
Very good.
Would you like the deposit

184
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,890
defrayed from the cost
of a jumbo cherry squishy?

185
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,687
No, not today.
I need the dime.

186
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,151
Oh, it is good to see you
are learning a trade.

187
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,444
Ching, ching, ching!

188
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,027
Aha!

189
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,571
Americanize this,
my good man.

190
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,276
Okey-dokey.

191
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,236
{\an8}All those coins were only
worth three lousy cents?

192
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,037
Let the good times roll.

193
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,830
This is so humiliating.

194
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,915
I feel like such a geek.

195
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,670
-How's it going, Bart?
-Terrible.

196
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,052
Cars slow down to laugh at me,
but no one's buying.

197
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:11,379
Maybe you need to play on their
sympathies more. Let's see...

198
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,639
Ha, now you look pathetic.

199
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,349
Ha-ha!

200
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,563
Aw, lemonade sucks!

201
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,773
I need a new product.

202
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,693
Let's see... Ah!

203
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,402
Form a line.
No crowding.

204
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,532
Cheap beer and a sympathetic ear.
Step right up.

205
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,490
Hey, Bart, can you give me one on credit?
I'm a little short this week.

206
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,492
Beat it.

207
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,373
Hey, you got a liquor license here,
young fella?

208
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,289
Uh... my dog ate it.

209
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,828
Got to have a license
to sell beer.

210
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,791
Hey! Writing all those tickets

211
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,581
must make you guys thirsty.

212
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,875
How about a couple
on the house?

213
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,339
Seeing how it's
a first offense...

214
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,669
I guess we can overlook this.

215
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,923
-Mm-hmm.
-(both chuckle)

216
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,416
So long, officers.

217
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,797
Uh-oh.

218
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,223
Hey, what's all the--
(screams)

219
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,893
My beer! My beer!

220
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,351
My beautiful beer!

221
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,436
MARGE:
The poor boy is so desperate.

222
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,979
He wants to earn money
to buy a comic book.

223
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,613
A comic book?

224
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,900
Oh, my.
Boys never change.

225
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,574
Which one is it,
<i>Nazi Smasher?</i>

226
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,863
I don't think so.

227
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,946
Send him over to my house.

228
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,742
I got a few chores
he could do.

229
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,406
He knows how to mix whitewash,
don't he?

230
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,745
-(crows cawing)
-Mrs. Glick?

231
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,882
You must be Bert Simpson.

232
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,169
Well, you look like you got
a strong, young back.

233
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,594
Would you like something
to eat?

234
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:36,433
I got dried apricots,
almond paste,

235
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,390
sauerkraut candy.

236
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,641
No, thanks.
Who's that?

237
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,983
Oh, that's my brother Esa.

238
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,229
He was killed
in the Great War.

239
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,231
Held a grenade too long.

240
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,895
This one's for you, Kaiser Bill.

241
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,744
Special delivery from Uncle Sam
and all the boys in "D" company--

242
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,530
Yeah, Johnny, Harrison,
Brooklyn Bob and Reggie.

243
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,655
Yeah, even Reggie.

244
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,662
He ain't so stuck up
once you get to--

245
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,333
(explosion)

246
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,502
(gulp)

247
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,790
Here, have some ribbon candy.

248
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,344
-Boys love candy.
-No, thanks.

249
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,878
-Boys love candy!
-Eww!

250
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,712
I think I'd rather
just get to work, ma'am.

251
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,128
We'll start with a little
light yard work,

252
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,137
and when you're done,
you can have a nice barley pop.

253
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,060
I want you to clear out
all the weeds.

254
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,809
You do know
which ones are weeds?

255
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,352
-All of them?
-Good boy.

256
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,726
Now be careful with these.

257
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,944
I'll be inside watching
my stories.

258
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,574
(sighs)

259
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,651
(grunting)

260
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,159
Ow!

261
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,329
Ow! Ooh!

262
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,499
<i>Jack, please.</i>
<i>I'm married.</i>

263
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,708
<i>That must be</i>
<i>what's turning me on.</i>

264
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,669
<i>Oh, stop it. Some more.</i>

265
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,500
Filthy...

266
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,255
but genuinely arousing.

267
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,878
-Finished.
-Merciful heavens!

268
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,216
You're bleeding.

269
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,930
I'll get the iodine.

270
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,760
(mumbling)
Now, let's see....

271
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,096
bunion pad... liver...

272
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,221
iodine.

273
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,307
Now don't fidget.

274
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,733
Listen, lady,
you don't have--

275
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,811
(long scream)

276
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,266
MRS. GLICK:
They never improved on iodine.

277
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,527
Hi, Mom.

278
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,278
Did you make any money?

279
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,900
Not yet, but at least
I'm in a lot of pain.

280
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,778
Well, I think what you're doing
for Mrs. Glick is very nice.

281
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,536
Poor old thing
doesn't have anybody.

282
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,948
There's a reason.

283
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:29,456
The sludge certainly collects

284
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,880
around those downspouts,
don't it?

285
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,669
I'll sludge you, you old bat.

286
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,384
Today, we wash Beulah.
You know what that is?

287
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,836
Some old lady thing nobody's
heard about for fifty years?

288
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,336
No.

289
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,848
It was my wedding dress.

290
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,930
But then I dyed it black

291
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,687
and it became my mourning dress.

292
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,310
Great story, lady.

293
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,991
Last night I dreamed
I held you in my arms.

294
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,493
(cat growling)

295
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,986
(yowling)

296
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,577
No, no, not the iodine!

297
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,872
Burn the germs off
with a torch

298
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,916
amputate my arm,
but not the...

299
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,710
(screaming)

300
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,625
Well, it's payday.

301
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:21,013
I'll wager you've been
looking forward to this.

302
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,181
Oh, yes, ma'am.

303
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,839
Here we are-- two quarters.

304
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,388
Two quarters?

305
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,181
You deserve every penny.

306
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,944
You know, I've told a lot
of my girlfriends about you

307
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,848
and they have chores too.

308
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,607
Two quarters?

309
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,438
Bart, you didn't say thank you.

310
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,065
Listen, lady,
I can leave without screaming,

311
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,902
and I can leave
without saying a bad word.

312
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,657
But there is no way
that I am saying thank you.

313
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,950
You're welcome.

314
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,293
All right then, off you go

315
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,659
to spend it on penny whistles
and Moon Pies.

316
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,827
(door slams)

317
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,995
BART:
Moon Pies, my butt.

318
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,504
Somebody ought
to Moon-Pie her.

319
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,375
What's the problem, boy?

320
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,422
I been bustin' my hump all week
for that withered old clam

321
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,166
and all I got was 50¢.

322
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,298
Hey, when I was your age,
50¢ was a lot of money.

323
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,506
-Really?
-Nah.

324
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,556
Dad, I've done
everything I could

325
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,350
and I've only got 35 bucks.

326
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,643
(groans)
I am through with working.

327
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,647
-Working is for chumps.
-Son, I'm proud of you.

328
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,570
I was twice your age
before I figured that out.

329
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,737
(gasps)

330
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,742
Can you let me have it for $40?

331
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,914
40 bucks? Forget it.
You made me get off my stool for that?

332
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,833
It's all I've got.
I sold seeds.

333
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,252
I visited my aunt
in the nursing home.

334
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:38,091
I fished a dime out
of the sewer, for God's sake!

335
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,048
No way.
What do you want?

336
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,459
Can I have it for 35?

337
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,917
No! No. Freaking kids.
I do not need this.

338
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,088
I've got a Masters degree
in Folklore and Mythology.

339
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:49,926
Do you have the Carl Yastrzemski
baseball card from 1973,

340
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,814
when he had big sideburns?

341
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,931
Show me the 30 bucks,

342
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,268
because if you ain't got it,
I ain't getting off the stool.

343
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,863
Okay.

344
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,478
Wait a minute.

345
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,185
Martin, if you, Milhouse
and I went in together

346
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,856
we could buy a copy
of <i>Radioactive Man</i> #1 right now.

347
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,526
-Wow!
-Wow!

348
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,575
-Here you go. Muttonchop Yaz.
-I don't want it.

349
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,078
-Freaking kids.
-Look pal, we got 100 bucks

350
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,871
and we'd like to buy
<i>Radioactive Man</i> #1.

351
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,705
So why don't you just
waddle over there

352
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,171
-and get it!
-Yes, sir!

353
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,960
Wow!

354
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,047
-Breathe it in, boys.
-(sniffing)

355
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,893
This is the stuff
dreams are made of.

356
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,930
It smells like my grandpa.

357
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,684
-(thunder rumbles)
-Uh-oh, looks like rain.

358
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,806
We better get this baby home.

359
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,983
Uh-oh.

360
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,813
Looks like you bought more
than you bargained for.

361
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,518
-(fiendish laughter)
-(thunderclap)

362
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,695
MAN'S VOICE: <i>My pants--</i>
<i>(straining)</i>

363
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,616
<i>...caught on barbed wire!</i>

364
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,924
<i>Good Lord! Choke!</i>
<i>An A-bomb!</i>

365
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,459
<i>-Yaarrgh!</i>
<i>-(explosion)</i>

366
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,754
<i>(grunts)</i>

367
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:08,087
<i>Becoming radioactive.</i>

368
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,425
<i>(deep, powerful voice) From</i>
<i>this day forward I shall call myself...</i>

369
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,932
<i>-Radioactive Man! </i>
-So that's how it happened.

370
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:18,555
I would have thought being hit by
an atomic bomb would've killed him.

371
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,524
-Now you know better.
-Turn the page, Bart.

372
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,034
BART:
Careful, careful. Ah.

373
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,204
Listen, you guys
are welcome to come over

374
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,621
and read it any time you like.

375
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,030
Why can't we keep it
at my house?

376
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,908
Your house?
That's crazy talk.

377
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,285
Well the comic's ours as much
as it is yours.

378
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,752
How about this, guys?

379
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,082
Bart can have it
Mondays and Thursdays,

380
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,837
Milhouse will get it
Tuesdays and Fridays,

381
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,839
and yours truly will take it
Wednesdays and Saturdays.

382
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,091
-Perfect.
-Wait a minute.

383
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,223
-What about Sunday?
-Yeah. What about Sunday?

384
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:55,101
Well, Sunday possession will be determined
by a random number generator.

385
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,680
I will pick the digits one through three,
Milhouse, four through six,

386
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,017
-and Bart will have seven through nine.
-Perfect.

387
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:04,273
Wait a minute.
What about zero?

388
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,146
-Yeah. What about zero?
-Yeah.

389
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,693
Well, in the unlikely event
of a zero,

390
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,907
possession will be determined by rock,
scissors, paper competition.

391
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,279
Best three out of five,
how's that?

392
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,235
-All right.
-That's cool.

393
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,195
Excellent.
Well, today being Saturday,

394
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,077
gentlemen, I guess I'll be
taking my comic and...

395
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,294
-Uh-uh-uh.
-Nice try, Martin.

396
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,174
It almost worked,

397
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,591
but tonight this comic book
stays right here.

398
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,470
If the comic stays right here,
then so do I.

399
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,468
Me too.

400
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,679
Fine. We're all going to stay
here with the comic book.

401
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,641
It will be like a sleep-over.
Yeah, a sleep-over.

402
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,932
That's what pals do, right?
Real friendly-like.

403
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,347
(wind blowing)

404
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,145
I want to read it again.

405
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,652
Nice try, mister.

406
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,244
Milhouse,
The acids in your hand

407
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,859
could damage the newsprint.

408
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,905
We want to keep
this comic forever

409
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,409
so the last one alive

410
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,291
will have the honor
of being buried with it.

411
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,498
What do you mean,
"The last one alive"?

412
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,619
-I meant years from now.
-Yeah, sure you did.

413
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,127
Bart, don't push him.

414
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,749
I knew it--
you're both against me.

415
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:12,296
Nobody makes a sap
out of Bartholomew J. Simpson.

416
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,932
-Quit it!
-You quit it.

417
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,219
No, you quit it.

418
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,270
(all choking)

419
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,059
I thought you boys

420
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,562
might like some milk
and microwave s'mores.

421
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:28,105
-(gasping) Thank you, Mrs. Simpson.
-Thanks, Mom.

422
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,070
Sweet dreams, boys.

423
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,150
(all crunching )

424
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,948
(thunder)

425
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,793
One more step,
and you're a dead man.

426
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,587
I have to go
to the bathroom, Bart.

427
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,761
Yeah right, so do I,

428
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,800
-but you don't see me getting up.
-What's going on?

429
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,553
Our dear friend Martin was trying
to steal the comic book.

430
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,006
Let's tie him up!

431
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,596
(thunder)

432
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,981
Bart, is this how you treat
all your guests?

433
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,438
Quiet, Piggy, or we'll stick an
apple in your mouth.

434
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,439
We can't take any chances.
We'll have to take turns watching him.

435
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,521
Okay. I'll go first.

436
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,476
Ah! So that's your little game.

437
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,187
Let old Bart get nice and drowsy

438
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,658
then when his back
is turned, wham!

439
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:20,328
-Well, it will not happen, see?
-You're going crazy, Bart.

440
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,409
I'm telling your Mom.

441
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,543
Hey, Martin, tell him
what we do with squealers.

442
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,659
I don't know. Is it worse than

443
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,826
what you do with people
who have to go to the bathroom?

444
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,495
You can't stop me.

445
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,924
The hell I can't.

446
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,253
(both grunting)

447
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,425
MARGE: Homer,
it's really coming down.

448
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,138
Could you check on the boys?

449
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,508
They're fine.

450
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,808
-Whoa!
-Yeow!

451
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,818
Bart! The comic!

452
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,284
Don't let go of me, Bart!

453
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,702
Milhouse, it's not
that far to the ground.

454
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,412
The rain's probably
softened it up a bit.

455
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:05,912
No, Bart, no!

456
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,036
You know, if you guys
hadn't tied me up,

457
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,923
I could be saving
the comic as we speak.

458
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,130
Shut up... shut up!

459
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,011
Help me, Bart.
I didn't even want the comic.

460
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:19,008
I wanted Carl Yastrzemski
with the big sideburns.

461
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,642
(grunting)

462
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,140
(ripping)

463
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,895
(sighs)

464
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,194
(growling)

465
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,486
(gasping)

466
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,489
(thunder clap)

467
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,534
(groaning)

468
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,117
Boys, you better
come in the house.

469
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,373
-You don't want to get the sniffles.
-Oh, Mom.

470
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,376
Oh, now, come on.

471
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,378
Hmm. You can play your
little tie-up game inside.

472
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,841
I've got some cocoa
on the stove.

473
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,762
Who wants imitation
marshmallows?

474
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,510
-I do!
-I do!

475
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,842
I'd raise my hand,
Mrs. Simpson, if I could.

476
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,848
(birds chirping)

477
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,022
(yawning)

478
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,769
D-oh!

479
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,943
It's no use, fellas.

480
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,862
Another comic book

481
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,781
has returned to the Earth
from whence it came.

482
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,700
We worked so hard
and now it's all gone.

483
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,160
We ended up
with nothing

484
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,950
because the three of us
can't share.

485
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,294
What's your point?

486
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,449
Nothing. Just kind of
ticks me off.
