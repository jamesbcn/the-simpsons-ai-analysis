Sorry.

176
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,767
The position has been filled.

177
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,318

178
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,861
Oh, dear.

179
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,494
Marge, you're making
a big mistake.

180
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,282
I'm gonna see you all day
at work and all night at home...

181
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,786
-(groans)
-And that's good.

182
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,829
But here's the bad part:

183
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,623
Uh, uh...

184
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,286
Ooh, look at that headline.

185
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,995
"Canada to hold referendum."

186
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,045
Sorry, Marge,
can't talk now.

187
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,508
We need the money.

188
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,298
And my life is pretty boring.

189
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,301
Last week, some Jehovah's
Witnesses came to the door,

190
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,974
and I wouldn't
let them leave.

191
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,553
They snuck away when
I went in the kitchen

192
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,008
to get more lemonade.

193
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,717
Yeah, lemonade is good.

194
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,267
I think it's wonderful.

195
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,601
Mom and Dad, side-by-side
at the power plant.

196
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,687
You'll be just like
Marie and Pierre Curie.

197
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,533
-What did they do?
-They discovered radium.

198
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,239
Then they both died
of radiation poisoning.

199
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,450
Hmm.

200
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,486

205
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,591
Now, Marge,
just remember.

206
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,505
If something goes wrong
at the plant,

207
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,853

can't speak English.

have you saved my butt?

The vapors? Jungle rot?

218
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,496
Shanty fever?
Poor man's gout?

219
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,499
Housemaid's knee?
Climactic bouba?

220
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,633
The staggers?
Dum-dum fever?

221
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,593

222
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,971

lost the key,
