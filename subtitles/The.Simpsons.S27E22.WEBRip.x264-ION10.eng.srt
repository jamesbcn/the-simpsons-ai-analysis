Bart, how could you--
What?

146
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,620
Your children
need to be supervised.

Take her away, boys.

148
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,793
If you take me away,
then who's gonna watch my kids?

149
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,251
You should've thought of that

150

the purview of this court

180
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,451
to determine how fat
and smelly your father may be.

181
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,452
Woo-hoo!

182
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,793
Mrs. Simpson, 90 days.

183
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,119
(gasps)

184
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,917
This is Kafkaesque.

185
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,040
Kafkaesque!

186
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,246
I've got my eye on you.

187
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,045
Now it's Orwellian.

188
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,628
(hinges squeaking)

189
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,178
Hey, kitties.
You got a new ball of yarn.

190
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,312
(door slams)

191
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,888
Oh, that guard is awfully slammy.

192
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,385
Newbies on top.

193
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,397
Oh. Where's the ladder?

194
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,230
Have you been claimed yet?

195
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,276
-Claimed?
-By one of the book clubs.

196
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,359
(sighs)

197
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,404
Yeah, we read a little,
dig a little,

198
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,568
read a little, dig a little,

199
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,236
kiss a little, dig a little.

200
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,735
(nervous groan)

201
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,076
(birds chirping)

202
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,209
Homer, I think you're supposed
to cook sausage.

203
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,461
What's the point?

204
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,672
(knocking on door)

205
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,592
Well, hi there, Homer.

206
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,840
I know a time like this is when
a man really needs his neighbor.

207
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,094
Yeah, well,
thanks for the check-in.

208
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,926
(chuckles)
Well, this is more than a check-in.

209
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,772
It's a chance to do good
for us boys in the hood!

210
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:40,098
Just call us NWA,
"Neighbors With Appetizers."

211
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,726
(sobbing)

212
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,272
Wow, wow.

213
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,976
I really am
the richest man in town.

214
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,437
Not rich in money,

215
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,357
but in what really matters: pity.

216
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,816
And what happened to Marge
is a wake-up call for us all.

217
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,828
There's no greater crime
than half-assed parenting.

218
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,581
Kirk, where's Milhouse?

219
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,503
On the leash, baby.
On the leash.

220
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,791
He's too far.

221
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,174
Retract.
Retract!

222
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,672
Whoa!
Why'd you pull me back?

223
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:10,014
Some new kids were just about
to give me a chance.

224
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,801
Don't try anything new, son.

225
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,854
I could've married a woman
who didn't look exactly like me.

226
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,019
(chuckling)
But that would've been crazy.

227
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,349
(door slams shut)

228
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,353
Hey, newbie.

229
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,435
Nobody touches
the new James Patterson

230
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,441
until Solar reads it first.

231
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,532
(moans, yelps)

232
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,532
She wants you to pick it up.

233
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,164
-(laughter) You scared, huh?
-(clucking)

234
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,582
(sighs)

235
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,044
(grumbling)

236
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,384
(growling)

237
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,378
-(gasping)
-Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.

238
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,303
Anybody else want a taste
of Blue Thunder?

239
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,553
Uh, I do. Yeah.
(grunts)

240
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,845
Now, if you ladies
recall what this place

241
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,599
is supposed to be for...

242
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,681
-Mm...
-Smokin' weed?

243
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,686
Reading!

244
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:03,808
(sighs)

245
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:07,064
(chewing sounds)

246
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,978
Dad, if this is what they send
when Mom goes to jail,

247
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,567
just imagine what happens
when you kick the bucket.

248
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:16,123
-(burps)
-Oh, man, that's gonna be so awesome.

249
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,198
Dad, Dad!
You're eating a teddy bear!

250
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,494
That's my stomach's problem.

251
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,708
Okay, Homer,
I just changed all the linens,

252
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,538
diapered the dog for modesty,

253
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,334
and replaced the batteries
in the smoke detectors,

254
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,917
which were all bad.

255
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,462
One was just a candy dish
with a red light painted on.

256
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,876
Was there any candy in it?

257
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:32,844
There is now.

258
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,723
(laughs)
Oh, Flanders.

259
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,680
It turns out there's
a good side to you after all.

260
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,262
Well, sir, maybe I know a little
bit about what it's like

261
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,558
to lose the lady of the house.
(sniffles)

262
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,852
Oh, I think I heard a dryer ding.

263
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,395
Thank you, Mr. Flanders.

264
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,439
Tell your boys I want to hang.

265
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,192
Flanders is great.

266
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,864
I've always said that.

267
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,362
But we can't forget your mother.

268
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,532

I never have time to exercise.

Oh. I miss your mother so much.

Really? 8:00?
I get to go to bed?

I don't have to clean
a sink full of dishes,

Aw, you're tired too.

Everyone goes to sleep
so easily here.

311
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,220
Marge, your positivity
is contagious.

312
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,015
I'm starting to believe
I really will show everyone.

313
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,019
Simpson, you got a visitor.

314
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,441
Oh, gee, now?
It's a shame to go inside.

315
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,824
Okay, let's move in the body now.

(groaning sigh)

317
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,372
Marge, I got great news.

318
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,659
We hired the one
good lawyer in town.

319
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,543
Yes, Mrs. Simpson,
I got you off on a technicality.

320
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,211
Since your husband never filed
for a birth certificate,

321
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,540
Bart isn't legally your son.

322
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,745
Mm? Mm?

323
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,004
How about that?

324
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,665
Why aren't you saying anything,
Marge?

325
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,214
You're free. Free.

326
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,217
Now, it's not the world
you remember.

327
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,379
The girl at the coffee place
that left?

328
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,588
Came back.

329
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,347
So you'll have that
to get used to.

330
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,849
I'm free?

331
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,521
Oh, and just in time.

332
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,599
Bart's claiming
he's in another dimension,

333
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,774
but I think he's just
hiding in the closet.

334
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,773
I had 90 days.

335
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,856
I was promised 90 days.

336
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,204
Now you have to give me
more time.

337
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,030
(stammers)
Oh, no you don't.

338
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,155
I can't go to another
school meeting.

339
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,663
I can't!

340
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,964
Everyone just asks about
their own kid.

341
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,868
Hey, you like shopping?
'Cause you just

342
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,747
bought yourself two more months.

343
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,094
(cackles)

344
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,798
Sorry, Homie.
I can't go back yet.

345
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,709
Just tell me where the soap
for the dishwasher goes

346
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,678
-and how do I...
-(lock clicks)

347
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,298
(sighs heavily)

348
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:11,268
Marge would rather stay in prison
than come home to me.

349
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,770
I have to reexamine my entire life.

350
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,943
Yeah, maybe you can start
by not bringing your kids to the bar.

351
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,481
(slurping)

352
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,225
Yeah, it's kind of funny--
Homer takes his kids to a saloon,

353
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,897
but Marge is in jail
