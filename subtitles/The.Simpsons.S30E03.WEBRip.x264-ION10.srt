1
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:22,856
Rats!

2
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:30,064
- Hey, is there someone in the restaurant?
- Oh, yeah.

3
00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:32,766
- Aw, he looks scared.
- Can we keep him? Can we keep him?

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,901
No.

5
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:35,669
We'll name him Bob Number One.

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,771
And, Dad, you can just go by
Bob Number Two,

7
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:39,440
or maybe no name at all.

8
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:41,609
Wait. Why would I be
Bob Number Two or no name?

9
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,611
- I am Bob.
- Well, yeah, but this is Bob,

10
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,546
so now we're, like, Bob and Bob.

11
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,748
- I don't like it.
- You can't just name a guy Bob.

12
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,418
- Yeah, you can. Somebody did it to you.
- That's true.

13
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:52,753
Bob Number Two is throwing out
some major 'tude right now.

14
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,888
- Isn't he though?
- Yeah, lose the 'tude.

15
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:57,758
It is kind of nice to have
someone in the restaurant.

16
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,527
- What's he doing?
- If he's robbing us,

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,061
I feel sorry for him.

18
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:03,397
No. Don't say that.
We're fun to rob.

19
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:05,366
Maybe he's just looking
for the bathroom.

20
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,600
You're overthinking it, bro!

21
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:08,702
Just go anywhere!
I'll clean it up!

22
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,538
No way.

23
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:25,286
<i>In Heaven!</i>

24
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:28,289
Where is everybody?

25
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:31,159
Didn't we just build
a whole new mixed-use complex

26
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:32,760
for the baby boomers?

27
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,133
I'm just following
the admissions criteria.

28
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:41,235
Can't we just tweak them a bit?

29
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:43,604
It's easier to get in
to Upper West Side preschools.

30
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:46,307
All we're getting up here
are little old ladies

31
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,809
and Promise Keepers.

32
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,778
Have you accepted the Lord?

33
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,913
I'm here, dimwit.

34
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,815
Frankly, those guys
weird me out.

35
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,785
We have interesting people.
Look, Tracy Morgan's here.

36
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,787
Tracy, what are you doing here?

37
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,656
- You're all better.
- Nobody tells me these things!

38
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,433
- You gonna stop that?
- It will stop on its own.

39
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,668
We've got to get
more people in here.

40
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:17,805
Ned Flanders is about to talk
about that very topic.

41
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:22,810
Do the people my daddy shoots
go to Heaven?

42
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,778
They do if they haven't
done anything wrong.

43
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,280
So, a lot of them, yes.

44
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:29,583
Come on, kids, think about it.
Why do people get into Heaven?

45
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,653
<i>Heaven</i>

46
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,155
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

47
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:40,027
<i>And my heart beats
so that I can hardly speak...</i>

48
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,029
Clayton Kersh...

49
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:43,797
<i>I seem to find</i>

50
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:46,834
<i>The happiness I seek</i>

51
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:51,772
<i>When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek</i>

52
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,043
<i>Heaven</i>

53
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:59,079
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

54
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,749
<i>And the cares
that hung around me</i>

55
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:06,287
<i>Seem to vanish like
a gambler's lucky streak</i>

56
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,491
<i>When we're out together</i>

57
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,126
<i>Dancing cheek to cheek</i>

58
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:17,765
Well, nobody said Sunday school
kids were geniuses.

59
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,568
Kids, there's only one way
into Heaven.

60
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:23,103
Never stray from
the path of righteousness.

61
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,538
Easy for you to say.

62
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:27,408
With a mustache like that,
you're an obvious narc.

63
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,677
The truth is,
this mustache is a memento

64
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,712
of the awful sinner
I used to be.

65
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:35,349
I was raised with no religion.
Our house was a den of bebop.

66
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:46,093
Neddy, you're coloring
inside the lines.

67
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:48,128
Rules are for fools, man!

68
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,697
That's right, baby.

69
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,799
Be free! Be free!

70
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,468
Go off the page.
Write on the wall.

71
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,203
Color a cloud purple.

72
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,373
Jack and Jill
are on the pill, man!

73
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:01,309
Godless and Maudeless,

74
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:03,977
each job I took
became more depraved.

75
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,713
<i>- Dead end
- Why we should be</i>

76
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,282
<i>- On dead end street
- Dead end</i>

77
00:04:08,316 --> 00:04:10,217
<i>People are living
on dead end street</i>

78
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,785
<i>Dead end</i>

79
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,755
<i>I'm gonna die
on dead end street</i>

80
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,290
<i>Dead end street</i>

81
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:17,725
<i>- Yeah
- Dead end street</i>

82
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,759
<i>Yeah</i>

83
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:19,927
<i>Dead end street</i>

84
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,296
Finally, I became one of
the most iniquitous men

85
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,766
that ever blew a wrapper off
a straw, door-to-door salesmen.

86
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,768
Now, here's how I move
these Karpet Kings.

87
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:31,739
I make my pitch, then I start
crying, bawling like a baby.

88
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:35,409
The trick is I'm secretly
clinically depressed.

89
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:37,077
Haven't thought of that.

90
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,279
Not bad.

91
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:41,349
Slices of pie all around, Mabel!

92
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,684
So, rookie, your first day.

93
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:46,286
What do they have you pushing,
water beds?

94
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,088
Well, I am reaching
for the stars

95
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,691
with Vertebreaker trampolines!

96
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,629
- What's so funny?
- They got you slingin' springs!

97
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,297
The kid's a hop jockey.

98
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,699
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

99
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:01,602
I know someone who sold
two of those tot tossers.

100
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,104
In his whole career!

101
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,642
What those
door-to-door ding-dongs

102
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:11,111
didn't count on was a little
extracurricular activity

103
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,880
during Apollo 14.

104
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,884
Over.

105
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,552
Over.

106
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:20,554
America caught bounce fever.

107
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:22,556
Trampolines were just
what people were looking for

108
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,326
to forget the long quagmire
that was Gunsmoke.

109
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,970
Before I knew it,
I was the king of springs.

110
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:40,007
But after spring
comes the fall.

111
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,543
Mabel! A slice of pie
for all my friends!

112
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,645
Better yet, leave the tin.

113
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,380
- Well!
- Well, how about that!

114
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:48,215
Big man, are ya?
Real big man.

115
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,818
Well, big man,
I got a headline for ya.

116
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,721
They just found out
those things are a death trap.

117
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,523
Oh, sure, there's broken bones,
concussions,

118
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,725
the occasional kid who goes up
and never comes down,

119
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,760
but I wouldn't call them
a death trap.

120
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,095
I mean electrocution, smart guy.

121
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,398
Those little angel makers
you've been slingin'

122
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:07,334
generate static electricity
with every bounce.

123
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,671
The mats are made of birthday
balloon rubber and cat hair.

124
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:14,842
If you get to 500 bounces,
zappo! French-fried kid.

125
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,277
I've put
innocent lives in danger.

126
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,947
And my sales pitch strongly
implied that wouldn't happen.

127
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,615
That's the game we're in.

128
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:25,619
If you don't like death,
get out of children's toys.

129
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,790
I've got to stop him!

130
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,793
401... 402...

131
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:34,895
I knew he could bounce,

132
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,264
but I had no idea
he could count.

133
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,803
412... 413...

134
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,605
Oh, the brake pedal
won't go down!

135
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:48,509
Why did I get these
super shag floor mats? Why?!

136
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,948
495...

137
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:58,051
496...

138
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,921
497... 498...

139
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:05,493
499...

140
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,012
- Jesus.
- 'Sup?

141
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,814
Lord? Why am I here?

142
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,749
Ned Flanders,
you have been a sinner,

143
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,084
but you have taken the first
step on the road to redemption,

144
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,353
and if you accept the word
of the Lord, that's me,

145
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,923
I shall return you to Earth
to carry forth my word of hope.

146
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,457
And like that.

147
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,693
Jimi Hendrix is here
for your guitar lesson.

148
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:42,462
Hey, man. You been practicing
what I told you?

149
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,498
Yeah, I meant to,

150
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:47,467
but I lost the pick
in the hole.

151
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,469
- Of the guitar?
- I wish.

152
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,774
I don't care, baby.
Jimi gets paid either way.

153
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,648
Praise the Lord, I am reborn!

154
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,217
It's a miracle!
He recovered without help!

155
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,620
In retrospect,
I should have tried CPR.

156
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,221
Well, I'm a believer.

157
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,559
Come on, fellas,
let's go spread the good word.

158
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,894
God is alive!

159
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,963
Anyone need a vacuum?

160
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,965
God gave me a second chance,

161
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,668
and as a sign of his mercy,
he permanently scarred

162
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,803
my beautiful,
beautiful philtrum.

163
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,041
And that's why I'm wearing
this mustache till I'm just ash.

164
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:30,177
It wasn't till God
seriously deformed me

165
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,713
that I fully understood
his love.

166
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:35,649
So, Ned Flanders
gets into Heaven.

167
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:38,385
It'll be interesting to see
which wife he goes with.

168
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,253
Either way,
it will be tough sledding.

169
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:45,994
Well, you know, Lord,
if you want more people here,

170
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:48,028
there's a category
you're not considering.

171
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,830
People who bring
their dogs on planes

172
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,732
and say they're therapy pets?

173
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,266
I can hear you.

174
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,403
Oh, and nice to meet you,
finally.

175
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,405
So, you made me in your image.

176
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:00,908
Well, it's like
looking in a mirror.

177
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:03,076
- Not!
- Who did that?

178
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,446
- It wasn't me.
- Oh, you traitor!

179
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,582
Actually,
I'm talking about people

180
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:11,084
who don't believe in God
but are still righteous.

181
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:13,086
I'm talking about
atheists, Lord.

182
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,554
Atheists?

183
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,790
I refuse to believe they exist.

184
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:20,060
Well, they do. Maybe they
deserve a place here too.

185
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,963
I'd like to talk about someone
who should be in Heaven.

186
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,564
My grandmother.

187
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:27,801
My grandmother's 36, and she's
got eight grandchildren.

188
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:29,402
Strong woman.

189
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,639
My grandmother was an atheist.

190
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,907
I'll just flip this.

191
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:37,044
Her name was Genevieve.

192
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,312
She lived in occupied France

193
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,782
in the darkest days
of World War II.

194
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:44,918
And she no longer
believed in God.

195
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:47,921
<i>He's in the afterlife,
punishing heavily</i>

196
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:51,058
<i>He's the boogie woogie
Christian God of John 3:16</i>

197
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,593
<i>A root, a toot,
just don't eat his fruit</i>

198
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:55,663
<i>He was born in a barn</i>

199
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,631
<i>He loved religion</i>

200
00:09:57,665 --> 00:10:01,234
How could a god
allow this awful war to happen?

201
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,671
I stopped a thousand wars
that would've been worse.

202
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:06,173
Nobody ever talks about that.

203
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:10,610
Perhaps her mélancolie
came from her marriage

204
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:15,182
to the village's most notorious
Nazi collaborator.

205
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,817
Bonjour, bonjour, Commandant!

206
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,788
And may I say, you put the ja
in jawohl!

207
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:23,256
Ah, my dear wife.
I'm just here collaborating,

208
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,925
mixing in a little treason.

209
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,694
You know, stuff
that'll look really bad

210
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,662
in a documentary if we lose.

211
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:31,932
Now, with business booming, you
can no longer deny your husband

212
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,135
the sweet fruits of marriage.

213
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,137
Oh, yeah, yeah.

214
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,406
I'm hooked.

215
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,375
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

216
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:46,446
Kissing with your eyes closed
never goes awry. Ever.

217
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:50,718
Why did I marry the model
for the town gargoyle?

218
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:55,288
Quiet.

219
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,725
Qui est là? Qui! Qui!

220
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,027
We're U.S. paratroops.

221
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,695
We've been roaming
the countryside

222
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:03,731
disguised as French farmers.

223
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:06,333
You must leave now.
My husband is a collaborator.

224
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:07,634
Well, I've got a screenplay

225
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,737
I've been looking for
someone to help me write.

226
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,071
Not that kind.

227
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,540
If he just gets something
on the page, that's progress.

228
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,810
Germans.

229
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:19,713
We're cooked. Worse than
the Cubs in the '32 Series.

230
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:22,883
I'm not a sports guy.
Do you have an art metaphor?

231
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,252
We'll be chopped up
worse than a Picasso nude!

232
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,955
Now my alarm is palpable!

233
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:32,159
What are you gonna do,
help us or turn us in?

234
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:36,329
Because I don't believe
there is a God above,

235
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:39,733
we must make our own Heaven
down below.

236
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:43,603
Hurry now!

237
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,206
- Do we get tips?
- Not in Europe.

238
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,641
Damn it. Now I know
what we're fighting for.

239
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:53,914
Quoi?!

240
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:57,250
Ooh-la-la! Dinner is served.

241
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:58,852
What an odd accent.

242
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,420
Are you really French?

243
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,089
Stinking customers!

244
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:04,191
You can't ask me
personal questions.

245
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:07,795
You are French.

246
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:18,772
American fool.
They'll see right through you.

247
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:20,640
You don't know the first thing

248
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,409
about world-class
dinner service.

249
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,978
Now listen here. I know
we may not look like much,

250
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:27,580
but when a fish knife
needs to be placed just so,

251
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,082
they're the mugs you want.

252
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,151
I am your...

253
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,653
How do you say sommelier
in French?

254
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,957
Café Meaux. Meaux speaking.

255
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,226
I'd like
to speak to Monsieur Pants.

256
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,294
- First name Pierre.
- Un moment.

257
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:44,597
Pierre Pants? Pierre Pants?!

258
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,734
Oh, come on, anyone
in this joint Pee Your Pants?

259
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,771
Heil humor!

260
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,673
Laughing is for Germans only.

261
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:59,012
Now, precisely what part
of France are you from?

262
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:00,747
Normandy beach.

263
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,349
You know,
where the invasion's coming.

264
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:05,785
We must warn our Panzers!

265
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:08,488
We got to stop 'em, but how?

266
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:12,725
Don't ask me. I believe
in nothing, except my country.

267
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:18,866
<i>Allons enfants
de la patrie</i>

268
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:23,503
<i>Le jour de gloire est arrivé</i>

269
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,773
<i>Contre nous de la tyrannie</i>

270
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,643
<i>L'étendard sanglant est levé</i>

271
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:34,814
<i>Ils viennent
jusque dans nos bras</i>

272
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:39,887
<i>Egorger nos fils,
nos compagnes...</i>

273
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,821
Come with me, fraulein,

274
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,557
and everything will be
Nietzsche keen.

275
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:49,696
You can drink our beer,
you can take our gold,

276
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,231
you can take my wife.

277
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,832
No, you can't!

278
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,703
Well, the marriage
counselor said

279
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:59,206
we should try to find
a common interest, so...

280
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,679
<i>Non, rien de rien</i>

281
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:12,152
<i>Non, je ne regrette rien</i>

282
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,354
<i>Ni le bien</i>

283
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,927
Oh, Meaux, I am so sorry
I ever made you kiss a fish.

284
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,661
That was a fish?

285
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,030
But this isn't.

286
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,667
There's more in the bedroom.

287
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,036
We have a bedroom?

288
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:36,409
So, it goes to show atheists
can do great things too.

289
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:38,411
All right, I agree.

290
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:41,714
We will open Heaven
to the deserving atheists.

291
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:44,384
And if you let them in,
there are a few mistakes

292
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,053
I'd recommend getting rid of.

293
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,854
Christopher Columbus.

294
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,457
Hey, what are
you two talking about?

295
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,192
Nothing.
What are you doing here?

296
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,028
I was looking for a quicker
route to the bathroom,

297
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,663
and I got lost.

298
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:03,270
- Oh, it's him.
- Hey, dudes.

299
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,038
Who wants to rub my belly?

300
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,977
Now, why don't you consider
other faiths for your Heaven?

301
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,712
Like, oh, I don't know,
the way of the Buddha?

302
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,049
I say no shirt, no shoes,
no salvation.

303
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,119
I say we have Lisa Simpson.

304
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:21,788
Well, there is redemption,
and there are good works.

305
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,723
But there is another path.

306
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,627
A path to enlightenment
without ego or possessions.

307
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,596
I don't know.
Jesus is pretty fond

308
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,065
of that plus sign
he's always carrying around.

309
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,001
Let me share
the Buddhist path to Heaven

310
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,003
with an enlightened tale
I call...

311
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:38,738
The Princess
Not Affiliated With Disney.

312
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,840
Unless we are now owned
by Disney.

313
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,909
In the sixth century B.C.

314
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,911
or zero in the Buddhist
calendar...

315
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,414
Oh, you have your own calendar.

316
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,449
What's today,
the fifth of Bibbity-boo?

317
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:52,519
Zero in the Buddhist
calendar,

318
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:55,822
lived the spoiled
Princess Siddmartha.

319
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:59,292
Siddmartha, sweetie,
look what we got you.

320
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,494
Oh, a pony.

321
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,196
50 ponies!

322
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:08,035
Somehow 50 ponies
seem less than one.

323
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:11,304
The princess wondered,
if nothing was denied her,

324
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:13,340
why was she not satisfied?

325
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:15,708
Why couldn't she be happy
like her brother

326
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:18,711
with his stupid
multiplayer games?

327
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:31,724
Brother, do you not grow weary
of this opulence?

328
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,693
Sometimes, but there's always
the decadence.

329
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:38,331
There must be a middle path
between opulence and decadence.

330
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,367
Flatulence?

331
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,701
No.

332
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:49,142
Please, somebody,
think of the elephants!

333
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:51,578
Princess Siddmartha,

334
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,814
perhaps the stars hold
the answer to your questions.

335
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,350
Why don't you take a look?

336
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:08,027
Those children have nothing,
but they're enjoying themselves.

337
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,397
Maybe all these riches
have blinded me

338
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,399
to what really matters.

339
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,434
Goats' heads...

340
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:18,771
That's mine.

341
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:31,684
<i>I live a life of
great excess</i>

342
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:36,389
<i>And yet I find no
happiness</i>

343
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:41,228
<i>There's more to life
than this, I hope</i>

344
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:44,063
<i>Than golden tubs
and fragrant soap</i>

345
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,866
<i>All kinds of stuff,
and yet I mope</i>

346
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:51,638
<i>I want less</i>

347
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,640
<i>Don't want to grab
life by the horns</i>

348
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:57,210
<i>Don't want to grab
that brass ring</i>

349
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,746
<i>Hear me shout
and hear me sing</i>

350
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:02,749
<i>All I want is just
one thing</i>

351
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:07,754
<i>I want less, I want less</i>

352
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,723
<i>Less, less, less</i>

353
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:15,762
<i>I want more of</i>

354
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:21,301
<i>Less...</i>

355
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,270
Less.

356
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:29,276
Disguised as a poor boy,
Siddmartha sought out

357
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,278
the most learned scholars
in the kingdom.

358
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:32,745
But she soon learned

359
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,748
Kathmandu U,
like Budhanilkantha Tech,

360
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,650
was just another party school.

361
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,489
Excuse me.

362
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,957
You're wasting your lives, man.

363
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:48,528
It's the year zero.
How much is there to learn?

364
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:51,664
Come on, girl.
Let's find inner peace.

365
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:03,543
I will sit under this Bodhi Tree
because I am void of ideas.

366
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:08,448
So, Siddmartha sat
and sat and sat and sat,

367
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,617
willing to wait
forever and a day

368
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,385
until she found enlightenment.

369
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:42,215
Namaste!

370
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:46,253
Even though she strayed from
our faith, I'm proud of Lisa.

371
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:50,590
That Buddhist kid's
a really good person.

372
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,525
What? I'm just sayin'.

373
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,093
If we've learned anything

374
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,329
from these three
tangentially-related stories,

375
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,598
it's that there are many
paths to Heaven.

376
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,833
Maybe we should let
everybody in.

377
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:04,837
Great idea. I decree that all
with good souls are welcome

378
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,774
in Heaven now and forever.

379
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,677
How did I get here?

380
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,012
Well, you see,
you were Smithers' plus one.

381
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,748
I demand to get in
on my own merits.

382
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,850
I'll talk to him.

383
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:22,254
<i>Hallelujah,
hallelujah, hallelujah</i>

384
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,095
Don't be scared, boys.

385
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:31,130
That's just angels bowling.

386
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,134
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

387
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,438
- Oh, we consider it a blessing.
- Kiss-up.
