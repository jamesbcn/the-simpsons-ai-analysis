1
00:00:46,702 --> 00:00:48,103
D'oh!

2
00:01:05,354 --> 00:01:06,788
It's 4:00 a.m.

3
00:01:06,856 --> 00:01:10,091
You kids should have been
in bed a half-hour ago.

4
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,526
We're watching the
Nobel Prize announcements

5
00:01:11,594 --> 00:01:13,228
live from Stockholm.

6
00:01:13,295 --> 00:01:14,429
Ooh, the Nobies!

7
00:01:15,364 --> 00:01:16,531
For Economics...

8
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,734
Jagdish Bhagwati.

9
00:01:19,802 --> 00:01:22,003
Huzzah!
I had him in the pool.

10
00:01:22,071 --> 00:01:23,138
Lucky.

11
00:01:23,205 --> 00:01:24,406
Quiet!

12
00:01:24,473 --> 00:01:26,441
It's time for the noblest
Nobel Prize of all:

13
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:28,076
the Peace Prize.

14
00:01:28,144 --> 00:01:30,345
I would kill for that.

15
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:33,314
And the Nobel Prize
for Peace goes to...

16
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:34,416
Isn't this
exciting?

17
00:01:34,483 --> 00:01:36,217
Krusty the Clown.

18
00:01:40,222 --> 00:01:43,458
And now, to comment
on joining the ranks of

19
00:01:43,526 --> 00:01:45,427
Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Ghandi, and Desmond Tutu,

20
00:01:45,494 --> 00:01:47,862
here's the man who
always parks in my spot,

21
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,497
Krusty the Clown!

22
00:01:49,565 --> 00:01:51,433
I'd just like to say:

23
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,736
this thing is worth
nearly two million dollars.

24
00:01:54,804 --> 00:01:57,806
How do you like me now,
Teen Choice Awards?

25
00:01:57,873 --> 00:02:00,742
Kent Brockman, Channel Six,
and channelsix.com.

26
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,111
Will you be flying
to Norway to accept the prize?

27
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:05,713
I'm looking forward to
visiting the Arctic Circle,

28
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:08,016
or as I call it,
my wife's side of the bed!

29
00:02:08,084 --> 00:02:09,851
For the purposes of
that joke, I'm married.

30
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:27,602
Hey! You!
Big Chief Laugh-at-Crap.

31
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,504
Meet me in my limo
in five minutes.

32
00:02:34,543 --> 00:02:36,144
Arctic Circle--
I just got that!

33
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:38,980
All right, all right,
settle down.

34
00:02:39,048 --> 00:02:41,950
Homer, you're the
easiest laugh I know.

35
00:02:42,017 --> 00:02:43,585
How easy am I?

36
00:02:43,652 --> 00:02:44,986
Shut up!

37
00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:46,654
I'm gonna need you
in the audience

38
00:02:46,722 --> 00:02:48,923
when I accept the
Peace Prize in Oslo.

39
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:50,358
Can my son come, too?

40
00:02:50,426 --> 00:02:53,061
He knows what to do
when I swallow my tongue.

41
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:54,329
Eh, why not?

I never go to Europe
without learning something.

49
00:03:12,948 --> 00:03:16,084
Now listen, I need you two
to hold these for me.

50
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:17,752
Your drugs
put me to sleep.

51
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,087
Your drugs
wake me up.

52
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:21,623
If I ask you to give
me more, you say no.

53
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,393
If I ask you again,
you give 'em to me.

54
00:03:25,461 --> 00:03:27,629
Why aren't I
going to Oslo?

55
00:03:27,696 --> 00:03:29,998
The Nobel Prizes
are my freakin' thing.

56
00:03:30,065 --> 00:03:31,799
But no, Bart
gets everything

57
00:03:31,867 --> 00:03:33,801
because he's the oldest,
and he's a boy.

58
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:35,770
And Maggie gets
what's ever left over,

59
00:03:35,838 --> 00:03:37,672
because she's the youngest
and she's a baby.

60
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,341
Meanwhile, I just
stand and wave

61
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:41,809
to people going
to better places.

62
00:03:41,877 --> 00:03:44,846
Would half a bottle of
confiscated water cheer you up?

63
00:03:44,914 --> 00:03:45,980
Ew, no thanks.

64
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,982
Oh. Quite the little
princess, ain't she?

65
00:03:49,785 --> 00:03:52,820
I'm just gonna chill out with
a little <i>This American Life.</i>

66
00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:55,490
I'm Ira Glass. Remember when
you were five years old,

67
00:03:55,558 --> 00:03:57,258
putting ketchup on your hot dog?

68
00:03:57,326 --> 00:03:59,627
Today, in five acts: condiments.

69
00:03:59,695 --> 00:04:01,296
Act one, mustard.

70
00:04:01,363 --> 00:04:03,164
Act two, mayo.

71
00:04:03,232 --> 00:04:04,899
Act three, relish.

72
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:07,402
Act four, corn relish...

73
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:09,537
Mom, this isn't
the way home.

74
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:11,439
Maybe we're not going
home right away.

75
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:13,041
Oh, I get it.

76
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:15,910
<i>They</i> go to Oslo,

77
00:04:15,978 --> 00:04:19,414
Well, you could get
some ice cream, or...

78
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:23,318
spend a week at
performing arts camp!

79
00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:25,420
Whoops-- didn't
time that quite right.

80
00:04:25,487 --> 00:04:28,389
Oh, my God! Mom, thank you!

81
00:04:28,457 --> 00:04:30,725
I just need my...

83
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:36,064
Now have
a great time.

84
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:38,399

00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:41,369
Aw, you think

counselors twice.

00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:08,993
We do a lot
of counseling.

113
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,495
Yeah, but we don't do
twice as much counseling.

114
00:06:11,563 --> 00:06:13,631
Well, don't question me
in front of the children!

115
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:15,166
She can't hear us,
we're stage whispering.

I can hear you.

117
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:17,601
No, you can't.

Huh? Wait a minute...
This doesn't look like Oslo.

136
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:02,279
Where are the
wood-stave churches?

137
00:07:02,347 --> 00:07:03,914
Historic
Akershus Fortress?

138
00:07:03,982 --> 00:07:05,349
You are
not in Oslo.

139
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:06,684
You are
in Holland...

140
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,853
specifically, The Hague.

141
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,254
Did you say
<i>a</i> Hague?

142
00:07:10,322 --> 00:07:11,856
I said <i>The</i> Hague.

143
00:07:13,158 --> 00:07:14,892
What's going on?
Where's my Nobel Prize?

144
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,759
There is no prize.

145
00:07:15,827 --> 00:07:17,528
It was merely a ruse

146
00:07:17,596 --> 00:07:19,129
to get you to Europe,

147
00:07:19,197 --> 00:07:21,165
so we could try you
for the terrible crimes

148
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,766
you've committed
on this continent!

149
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:24,635
It was all a setup!

150
00:07:24,703 --> 00:07:26,003
You gotta read
me the charges!

151
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,872
You dropped a monkey
from the Eiffel Tower...

152
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:29,139
Uh-huh.

153
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:30,474
In Greece, you committed
something called

154
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:31,742
"aggravated hey-hey"...

155
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,077
Forgot about
that one.

156
00:07:33,144 --> 00:07:35,179
And here in Holland,
you stole the entire act

157
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,848
of our beloved
clown "Van Krusten."

158
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,851
U bestolen al
mijn jokenchortles!

159
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:44,655
Gaah! Oh, wait a minute,
wait a minute!

160
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:47,558
One of the most
important skills

161
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:50,394
a performer can learn
is dealing with hecklers.

162
00:07:50,462 --> 00:07:52,196
And... action!

163
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,164
Top of the evening,
Officer Krupke.

164
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:56,000
Your dog's dead!

165
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:57,501
Um... that's not
really a heckle.

166
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:59,503
Right, yeah, right.

167
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:03,173
I've seen more life in the
Wellington Botanic Gardens!

168
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:05,175
That is a heckle,
but if you're not

169
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:07,111
from New Zealand,
it loses some of its sting.

170
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:08,412
How much?
Well, most of it.

171
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,080
Do you think they
won't know the reference?

172
00:08:10,148 --> 00:08:11,815
If they did
know the Gardens,

173
00:08:11,883 --> 00:08:14,785
then they would know that
they're teeming with life.

174
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:16,353
So, what do
you guys do

175
00:08:16,421 --> 00:08:18,222
when you're not
camp counselors?

176
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,157
We're highly
successful artists.

177
00:08:20,225 --> 00:08:21,525

Springfield's most
artistic borough...

179
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,928
Sprooklyn.

180
00:08:25,997 --> 00:08:27,965
We spend our days
acting and painting...

181
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:28,866
dancing and sculpting...

182
00:08:28,934 --> 00:08:31,001
playing my Gibson...

183
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:32,136
rehearsing my Ibsen.

184
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:33,771

for everything
I've been charged with

211
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,341
and all the stuff
you don't know about yet.

212
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:45,709
There is only
one possible way

213
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:46,744
to earn your freedom.

214
00:09:46,811 --> 00:09:49,146
Oh, I get it.

215
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:53,584
Everyone's windmill needs
a new blade now and then, right?

216
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:57,021
No! Our windmills are
the envy of the world!

217
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:01,458
To win exoneration, you must
prove that you have made

218
00:10:01,526 --> 00:10:04,895
a singular contribution
to Western culture.

219
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:06,130
Western, huh?

220
00:10:06,197 --> 00:10:07,965
Did you ever see
my "Wyatt Burp" sketch?

221
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:10,801
Everyone on my payroll
says it's great.

222
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:13,537
I am not familiar
with this "Wyatt Burp."

223
00:10:13,605 --> 00:10:15,339
Oh, uh...
then, uh...

224
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,474
Let me do my "Dutch Oven" bit!

225
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:19,176
It's about other Dutchmen,
not you.

226
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,211
You know, uh...

227
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:27,134
Those clouds look like
a casting director saying,

228
00:10:27,202 --> 00:10:28,502
"You've got the part."

229
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,904
That cloud
looks like legendary

230
00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:32,607
Broadway lyricist
Betty Comden.

231
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,509
I finally found
the place I belong.

232
00:10:35,577 --> 00:10:37,878
You're week's up.
Time to go home!

233
00:10:37,946 --> 00:10:40,081
It can't be Saturday already.

234
00:10:40,148 --> 00:10:41,749
Monday was orientation.

235
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:44,151
Tuesday, we did mime.

236
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:45,953
Wednesday we did <i>Mame.</i>

237
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,089
Thursday we got
attacked by bees.

238
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:50,024
Friday morning, Andrew Lloyd
Webber and Elaine Stritch

239
00:10:50,092 --> 00:10:51,192
helped us make wallets.

240
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,860
Friday evening, we performed

241
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:55,363
<i>Angels in America:
A Gay Fantasia on National Themes</i>

242
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,131
<i>Part One:
Millennium Approaches</i>

243
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,132
<i>Part Two...</i>

244
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,467
<i>Perestroika?</i>

245
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:00,701
That's right!

246
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:02,370
Strike the set,
pizza party,

247
00:11:02,437 --> 00:11:03,871
Saturday morning,
and then...

248
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:05,740
No!

249
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:07,675
Good-bye, Lisa.

250
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:10,911
I'll miss you a lot, then a
little, then not too much.

251
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:14,482
Lisa, do you have
to leave this minute?

252
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,183
No time.

253
00:11:16,251 --> 00:11:19,086
I don't want to get stuck behind
the joggers from the fat camp.

254
00:11:24,693 --> 00:11:26,427
I can't go home.

255
00:11:26,495 --> 00:11:29,497
Something happened this week
that completely changed me.

256
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:32,566
Oh, you didn't see a boy lose
his swim trunks, did you?

257
00:11:32,634 --> 00:11:34,035
No.

258
00:11:34,102 --> 00:11:36,637
I fell in love with theater,
dance, and song.

259
00:11:36,705 --> 00:11:39,273
We've got plenty
of songs in the car,

260
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:41,409

You're usually the first
one out of this death trap.

272
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:18,089
Well, the combination
of me leaving arts camp

273
00:12:18,157 --> 00:12:19,958
and you driving
on and off the shoulder

274
00:12:20,026 --> 00:12:21,560
has made me a little ill.

275
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:24,095
Sorry. I guess I shouldn't be
playing this driving game

276
00:12:24,163 --> 00:12:25,463
while I'm driving.

277
00:12:29,735 --> 00:12:32,437
Okay, maybe it won't
be that bad.

278
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:35,574
Hey Lisa, how
was farts camp?

279
00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:37,642
Farts camp--
that's great.

280
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,844
Arts camp was lovely.

281
00:12:39,912 --> 00:12:43,615
Did you paint a picture
on toilet paper?

282
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,518
Lisa Simpson, please stick

283
00:13:03,586 --> 00:13:05,954
to the illegally
Xeroxed sheet music.

284
00:13:06,022 --> 00:13:09,190
But arts camp encouraged us
to spread our wings and fly.

285
00:13:09,258 --> 00:13:11,626
Lisa, I went to arts camp, too.

286
00:13:11,694 --> 00:13:13,628
And all it does
is fill your coconut

287
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:16,164
with banana-cream dreams
that can never come true.

288
00:13:16,232 --> 00:13:17,365
How do you cope?

289
00:13:18,901 --> 00:13:21,603

Krusty's made
a cultural contribution.

295
00:13:45,535 --> 00:13:47,002
Let's see what
we've got here.

296
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:04,936
Ah, here we are--

297
00:14:06,772 --> 00:14:11,609
Top to bottom, left to right,
readin' things is outta sight.

298
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:14,479
Speaking of out of sight,
you've gotta hide me.

299
00:14:14,547 --> 00:14:17,849
I slept with the lighting
director's wife, and...

300
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:34,916
No appetite, honey?

301
00:14:34,984 --> 00:14:37,852
It's just dinner
conversation at arts camp

302
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,754
was a bit more stimulating.

303
00:14:39,822 --> 00:14:42,524
One night we spoke only
in lines from famous poems.

304
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,426
Because I could
not stop for death,

305
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:46,761
he kindly stopped for me.

306
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:48,329
Emily Dickinson.

307
00:14:48,397 --> 00:14:50,031
No, I was just
describing my day.

308
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:55,603
If you need me, I'll be upstairs
saying good-bye to my dreams.

309
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:58,773
My dream is to be able
to walk up stairs

310
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:01,142
like an eight-year-old girl.

311
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:10,051
Maggie, your
big sister is leaving

312
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:12,253
for a more
artistic life.

313
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:13,755
I'll send for you
when I'm famous.

314
00:15:13,823 --> 00:15:16,324
We'll take the town by storm,
like the Bronte sisters.

315
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:24,199
Oh, Maggie, don't ever turn two.

316
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:50,863
Aha!

317
00:16:02,643 --> 00:16:03,709
Lisa Simpson.

318
00:16:03,777 --> 00:16:05,444
What are you doing here?

319
00:16:05,512 --> 00:16:07,346
I came to share in the esteem

320
00:16:07,414 --> 00:16:09,315
that the world bestows
on its artists.

321
00:16:10,817 --> 00:16:11,951
Uh, yeah.

322
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,520
Brrr!

323
00:16:14,588 --> 00:16:17,156
Boy, it sure is cold in here.
No heat.

324
00:16:17,224 --> 00:16:18,991
It's, uh, part of our art.

325
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:22,528
More art.

326
00:16:22,596 --> 00:16:24,363
Ethan, look what
I stole from work.

327
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:25,698
Yes!

328
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:26,732
Tomatoes?

329
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,434
What kind of artists are you?

330
00:16:28,502 --> 00:16:30,302
Sandwich artists.
But we get to eat

331
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,038
any sandwiches we
drop on the floor.

332
00:16:32,105 --> 00:16:33,606
Unless we drop
them on purpose.

333
00:16:33,674 --> 00:16:35,708
They've got cameras
on us at all times.

334
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:37,843
Are you saying
that arts camp was a lie?

335
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:39,478
Well, not the swimming.

336
00:16:39,546 --> 00:16:42,648

00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:27,226
in the sense
that we exist.

352
00:17:27,294 --> 00:17:30,029
Not for long, if we don't
drop more sandwiches.

353
00:17:30,097 --> 00:17:31,464
<i>Herschel Krustofsky,</i>

354
00:17:31,531 --> 00:17:33,766
you stand accused of
the most heinous crimes

355
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:35,234
known to clowndom.

356
00:17:35,302 --> 00:17:37,269
Have you anything to say
in your defense?

357
00:17:37,337 --> 00:17:38,604
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

358
00:17:38,672 --> 00:17:40,139
I've led a worthless life.

359
00:17:40,207 --> 00:17:42,441
I've been this way
since I was a little...

360
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:43,476
squirt!

361
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:45,377
Heh? Heh?

362
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:49,148
Come on, I thought you
Euro-jerks loved unfunny comedy.

363
00:17:49,216 --> 00:17:51,317
We don't put "Euro"
in front of everything.

364
00:17:51,384 --> 00:17:52,585
Euro-guards!

365
00:17:52,652 --> 00:17:54,086
Take him away
in Euro-cuffs.

366
00:17:56,323 --> 00:17:57,857
Wait! Not so fast!

367
00:17:57,924 --> 00:18:00,259
We found something
to save Krusty!

368
00:18:00,327 --> 00:18:02,228
And it's on this DVD.

369
00:18:02,295 --> 00:18:03,996
Is it region one or region two?

370
00:18:04,064 --> 00:18:06,098
Uh, what region is America?

371
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:06,932
Region one.

372
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,033
Woo-hoo!

373
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:09,068
We're region one!

374
00:18:09,136 --> 00:18:10,236
We're region one!

375
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,837
Well, this is
region two,

376
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:13,706
so I'm afraid your
exculpatory evidence

377
00:18:13,774 --> 00:18:16,142
will produce nothing more
than an error message

378
00:18:16,209 --> 00:18:17,943
stating
"unreadable disc."

379
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:19,211
If it please
the court,

380
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:21,881
my brother has a
multi-region player.

381
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:24,583
I just pray he's not
on a state-mandated

382
00:18:24,651 --> 00:18:25,951
five-week vacation.

383
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:37,830
Get this back
to me by 6:00.

384
00:18:37,898 --> 00:18:41,500
I'm having a <i>Real Housewives</i>
<i>of Atlanta</i> season two party.

385
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:47,840
My dressing room has
<i>regular</i> potato chips,

386
00:18:47,908 --> 00:18:49,942
but my contract
specifically stated

387
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,977
half regular, half ruffled!

388
00:18:52,045 --> 00:18:53,078
Krusty, please...

389
00:18:53,146 --> 00:18:54,747
Forget it! Forget it!

390
00:18:54,815 --> 00:18:55,981
The gig's off!

391
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:57,650
I ain't gonna play Sun City.

392
00:18:57,717 --> 00:18:59,618
Vuvuzela me out of here.

393
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,791
Three days later,

394
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:08,360
South Africa freed
Nelson Mandela from prison.

395
00:19:08,428 --> 00:19:11,630
Krusty the Klown, your
selfishness has saved the world.

396
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:12,798
Case dismissed.

397
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:16,202
I'm just glad you
all finally saw

398
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:18,537
what an amazing
human being I am.

399
00:19:18,605 --> 00:19:20,206
Now, where's the
nearest place

400
00:19:20,273 --> 00:19:22,241
I can score a little
victory weed?

401
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:23,843
That would be the
courthouse cafeteria.

402
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,177
I'll be right there.

403
00:19:25,245 --> 00:19:27,079
Order me, um,
a raspberry crepe

404
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:28,781
and a brick of hash.

405
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:30,349
How do you smoke it?

406
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:33,018
I melt it and inject
it into my eyelid.

407
00:19:33,086 --> 00:19:34,620

'cause this song is gonna get

420

Good-bye, guys.

421
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:15,060
I'll try again
when I'm older.

not our reality.

424
00:20:18,498 --> 00:20:20,666
And we gave you a little
surprise for your trip back.

425
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:21,934
Is it your laundry?

426
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:24,136
Okay, two surprises.

427
00:20:26,172 --> 00:20:28,641
In a way, I think
we learned more from her

428
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,609
than she did from us.
Yeah, well, obviously,

429
00:20:30,677 --> 00:20:31,744
because we taught
her nothing.

430
00:20:36,016 --> 00:20:38,017
Lisa, look!

431
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:43,355

00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:49,795
Weren't we just back there?

435
