1
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,533
D'oh!

2
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:51,638
And so in summary,
there are only two real commandments,

3
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:54,614
and the other eight are just filler.

4
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:55,949
I knew it.
- Yeah.

5
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,551
And now I have some exciting news.

6
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,553
Tomorrow we'll be blessed with a visit...

7
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:04,657
...from the highest ranking clergyman
of our Presbylutheran faith,

8
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:07,089
His Holiness, the Parson!

9
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,130
The Parson? He's coming here?

10
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:16,451
Oh, my God! She fainted!
Let's go get smelling salts.

11
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,871
HOMER: Suckers!

12
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,942
Springfielders have
camped out all night...

13
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,959
...to get a glimpse of
the most saintly person...

14
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:25,812
...to visit our town...

15
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:29,282
...since Mother Teresa stopped here
to gas up her Vespa.

16
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:32,018
And I'm selling all sorts of
faith-based knickknacks.

17
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,187
Let's take a look.

18
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,389
I'd commit arson for the parson.

19
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,091
Clergymen can kiss my apse.

20
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,959
All kinds of gems.

21
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:43,029
Surprisingly, none of them have sold.
Except for this one.

22
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,600
There you have it.
News has never been softer.

23
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,760
What's that? The Parson is here!

24
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,441
Oh, my God! It's him!

25
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:59,946
The earthly embodiment of the elected
chair of the National Congress of Deacons!

26
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,182
Well, well, well. Hello, everybody.

27
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,485
I hope you didn't go
to all this trouble for little old me.

28
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,788
Parson! Parson! Give us a quick
official church position on family.

29
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:13,793
Well, in these modern times,
family is more important than ever.

30
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,783
You just made my moustache tingle.

31
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,398
Settle. Settle down.

32
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:24,104
Now, now. I am just a man like any other,
that has been chosen by God.

33
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,842
I have come here from our world spiritual
headquarters in Michigan City, Indiana,

34
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,638
to say, keep up the good work.

35
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,783
And now if you'll excuse me,

36
00:03:34,883 --> 00:03:37,117
I'll do a little speakin'
with your deacon.

37
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,654
I love to go to church
It's where I like to be

38
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:46,350
I get a day in of praying
And still tee off by three

39
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,029
Calm down, Tim.

40
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,765
He's just your old roommate
from Texas Christian.

41
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,334
He's like the pope of this thing!

42
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:58,138
This would be like Mary Kay visiting you
when you were selling her cosmetics!

43
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,673
That is, if you had stuck with it.

44
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,476
You asked me to quit
because I was making more than you.

45
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,576
Not now. He's here.

46
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,580
Welcome, Your Holiness.

47
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,516
You'll love what we've done
with the church.

48
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,352
There's fresh wax on all the pews.

49
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,889
Sounds to me like somebody put on
more than just one coat.

50
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:16,956
Maybe.

51
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,025
Tim, is there somewhere that we can talk?

52
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,787
Of course. My office.
- Perfect.

53
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:25,098
Walking to your office
Is what I like to do

54
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,768
Maybe while we're at it
We'll peek in at your pews

55
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,404
Nilla Wafer?

56
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,573
I'll take two if you don't mind.

57
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:37,577
Tim, I'm here because of a problem
with your last recertification.

58
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:41,781
When we tried to charge the filing fee
to your credit card, it was declined.

59
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,116
Oh, yeah.

60
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:48,321
The bank put on a security hold after they
saw a charge from an offshore poker club.

61
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:52,091
Helen had bought a fireplace poker
from Nova Scotia.

62
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:56,129
She says it shifts logs better than
American pokers, but I disagree.

63
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,698
We'll get through it. We always do.

64
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,867
Well, love conquers all, huh?

65
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,370
I remember when she was
Helen Schwartzbaum.

66
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,574
In fact, I remember when she was
Harold Schwartzbaum.

67
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,275
You what?
- I've said too much.

68
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,945
But for the three months
it took your card to go through,

69
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,446
you weren't certified.

70
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:18,751
Anything you officiated during that time,
funerals, baptisms, even bingo,

71
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:19,953
well, it just didn't count.

72
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:24,217
Well,
I'm sure the Lord is understanding.

73
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,858
No, he's not!

74
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,528
I'll notify those affected right away.

75
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,199
Tea time.

76
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:40,065
What's going on?
- Helen, I was briefly uncertified.

77
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,809
So all those graces you said were a lie?

78
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:47,180
That food might as well have been
regurgitated by Satan himself.

79
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,516
Regurgitated by Satan
He couldn't keep it down

80
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:56,226
Old 666, he got sick, sick, sick
And that's how volcanoes were born

81
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,486
Due to a bureaucratic snafu,

82
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:05,898
I wasn't an official minister
when we laid your dear Estelle to rest.

83
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,091
So, she's still alive?

84
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,736
I'm afraid not.

85
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,839
Good. Because I left her ashes on the bus.

86
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,939
Mmm.

87
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:19,412
So, Captain, when I blessed your vessel,
it didn't count.

88
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,580
Maybe the next one!

89
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:30,957
So I'm afraid I wasn't a minister
when I blessed your tin roof shanty.

90
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,460
So that's why that ghost
keeps a-comin' to the window.

91
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,896
MAILMAN: Afternoon.
- Fly away, ghostie!

92
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,886
Go back to your haunted cornfield!

93
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:46,072
Reverend Lovejoy, you deliver pizza now?
We didn't order a pizza.

94
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:50,943
But you forgot the pizza anyway.
Marge, the pizza place screwed up again!

95
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:55,448
You remember when I remarried you two
after Homer got that divorce?

96
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,675
Like it was yesterday.

97
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,157
Kirk and Luann split up.

98
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,728
So, Homer, fearing we would do the same,
preemptively filed for divorce.

99
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:13,266
But then you re-married us
and we were as solid as ever.

100
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,336
And I think Apu got lucky with my sister.

101
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,639
Well, I'm afraid that joyous occasion...

102
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:23,343
...fell during a time
when I wasn't actually a minister.

103
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,693
Since that time,
you two have not been legally wed.

104
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:32,085
You don't get it, Padre.
My old lady and I have a thing going on.

105
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,821
We don't need a piece of paper
to keep it real.

106
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:39,851
Who are you calling an old lady?
- I need that paper quick!

107
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,864
So, you and Mom aren't married?
Does that mean I'm a bastard?

108
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,967
You were born while they were married.
So, legally, no.

109
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,404
But in the sense someone calls you one
when they're angry, yes.

110
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:52,839
It's not a big deal.

111
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,675
We'll just go to City Hall
and get married there.

112
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,577
I think it's romantic.

113
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:01,347
You can pretend you're newlyweds
starting a life together.

114
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:04,183
Yeah, instead of exhausted zombies
running down the clock.

115
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,323
Why, you little bastard!

116
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:07,887
That's the angry one.

117
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,594
MOE: Hmm.

118
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,800
This isn't the most romantic place
to get married.

119
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,838
Sweetie, any place I'm marrying you
is the most romantic place in the world.

120
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,174
Watch your back!
Half a corpse coming through!

121
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,814
Marge, this time I'm gonna give you
the wedding you deserve.

122
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,048
Let's get out of here.

123
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:39,888
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's the line to get out.

124
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,261
MARGE: Ah!

125
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,798
Hello?
- Hello. It's me, Lance Romance.

126
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,370
Your first mission
is to look out the window.

127
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,698
Whatever you say, Lance.

128
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,876
Oh!

129
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,915
Whoa!

130
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:14,654
BILL: This is Bill and Marty saying,
''Marge, go down to the basement.''

131
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:26,965
Homer, what's going on?
The violin, pants with a crease? Why?

132
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:31,437
Marge, you deserve a wedding day that,
unlike our children,

133
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,537
was planned in advance.

134
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,532
So, will you marry me in style?

135
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:40,476
Yes, Homer! Yes!

136
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,749
Did you hear that, Santa?
She said yes! Yes!

137
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,954
Now back to your cold, airless tomb.

138
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,113
SANTA: Ho, ho, ho.

139
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,961
Oh! It's beautiful.

140
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,400
But that's an awful lot to pay
for a dress I'll only wear once.

141
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,605
Marge, a woman only gets one chance
at a second remarriage.

142
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:06,706
The choice is yours.

143
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:10,543
You can look like a fairy princess
or a pig wrapped in rags.

144
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:14,553
Uh... A princess?
- Fine. We'll do it your way.

145
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,015
This one's a little gay, isn't it?

146
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,519
Well, the last time I checked,
pirates weren't gay.

147
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,619
How'd you check?

148
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,358
Check out this rocket ship cake, Marge!

149
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,728
That's for a child's birthday.
We're going to get this one.

150
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,364
Maybe we could bury the rocket ship
inside the cake.

151
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,467
And that would be a big surprise
because I'd forget about it pretty quick.

152
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:38,003
No rockets! You can pick the frosting.

153
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,569
Chocolate!
- We'll take lemon.

154
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:46,012
Okay, I want white roses at the altar,
red roses along the aisle,

155
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,782
and blue roses in the centerpieces.
- There are no blue roses.

156
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:53,085
I want to talk to Howard!
- Howard died 10 years ago.

157
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,655
Well, did he take
all the blue roses with him?

158
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,089
My father was a lovely man.

159
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,759
He took very good care
of my mother and me.

160
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,131
All right, people, I want every table
to have two baskets of bread...

161
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,766
...but only one plate of butter.

162
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,401
That will stimulate conversation.

163
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,937
What if we...
- There is no 'we' in wedding!

164
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,005
But there is, Marge.
The first two letters.

165
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:17,944
I can't believe you're ruining
the second Thursday before the wedding!

166
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,612
Homer!

167
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,617
I can't believe you told Lenny and Carl
they could bring dates.

168
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,385
'Cause they're not even coming
to the wedding.

169
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:27,453
Why not?

170
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:32,091
Because their RSVP cards
arrived one day after the deadline!

171
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,728
Marge, maybe you should take a break
from wedding planning.

172
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,097
I think you're becoming a bridezilla!

173
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,599
Bridezilla?

174
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:44,398
A combination of bride and Godzilla?

175
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:48,007
How could you say that?
More like you're a King Wrong!

176
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:01,854
Mmm.

177
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,202
No matter what I do, Marge yells at me.

178
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,485
If she's like this now,

179
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:19,839
what will she be like
after we get married?

180
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,939
Oh!

181
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:27,462
Okay! Okay! Everyone, back off!
I want to see myself.

182
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:32,506
A pimple? Not on my day, you don't.

183
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,722
Okay, it's go time. Dim the lights.

184
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,425
Cue the band.

185
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,462

186
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,928
And release the groom!

187
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,967
Homer, that's you!

188
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:54,567
We are now 11 seconds behind schedule!

189
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,745
Homie?

190
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,280

191
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:22,835
I can't believe Homer
left me at the altar.

192
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,267
Marge, have a shrimp puff.

193
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,573
Wipe your tears
with a monogrammed napkin.

194
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,308
MARGE: Oh!

195
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,443
I know it is hard,

196
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,746
but smile for the cameraman
from Gary's Magic Moments.

197
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,311
You have my deepest sympathy.

198
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,288
HOMER: What's going on?
What's with all the darkness?

199
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,880
Hello? Marge? Where am I?

200
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,665
What the...
I'm chained up like a common bicycle!

201
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,992
Who would do this to me?

202
00:13:56,101 --> 00:14:00,521
It would have to be someone
who could afford a chain.

203
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,875
DEEP VOICE ON SPEAKER:
You're going to be here awhile.

204
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,243
But I have to marry Marge!

205
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,613
As of now,
your pathetic little life means nothing!

206
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:11,383
Just so you know, you're making
a pretty bad first impression!

207
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,483
It's all my fault.

208
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:17,289
Homer wanted to serve
those little cocktail hotdogs.

209
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:21,985
But, no! I had to have spring rolls!

210
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,134
They taste like nothing.

211
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,032
I don't understand.

212
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:30,302
Dad would never miss an open bar
with chicken wings.

213
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,905
Plus, he loves Mom and us,
yadda-yadda-yadda.

214
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,005
Hey, I found something!

215
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,278
Sideshow Bob!
- Sideshow Bob?

216
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:43,682
He ruined the wedding,
getting his revenge on us at last!

217
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:50,072
Because he knows that if Mom and Dad
don't get married, I'll never be born!

218
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,962
I've got some wedding registry items
for Mrs. Simpson.

219
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,520
I'm afraid I'm just Ms. Simpson now.

220
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,334
Interesting nuance.

221
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:07,873
I'd like to hear more about it
but company policy forbids chitchat.

222
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,775
I miss you so much.

223
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,279
DEEP VOICE: To remove that chain,
you need the key to the lock.

224
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,948
You idiot.
How am I ever gonna find the key to the...

225
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,048
Here it is.

226
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,587
To get the key,
I have to lick through a lollipop?

227
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,687
How awful!

228
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:29,361
What the...
- The lollipop is made of hot sauce.

229
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,362
Oh! Whose side are you on?

230
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,610
Sideshow Bob, drop that knife
and give back our dad!

231
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:50,482
I'm working on a bust of Krusty
and using this knife to aerate the clay.

232
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,687
Anyone for a peppermint tea?
- Not for me.

233
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,689
But the monkey
needs to keep his strength up.

234
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,391
We're gonna drop him out of a blimp
tomorrow and see what happens.

235
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:05,464
Don't worry. Nothing's gonna
happen to you, Mr. Teeny number seven.

236
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,801
Bob, did you take any breaks yesterday
to kidnap our dad?

237
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:12,037
Impossible. I was with Bob the whole day!

238
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:15,040
Then we watched the deluxe DVD
of The House of Sand and Fog.

239
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,309
At night,
we slept in the same bed for warmth.

240
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:21,347
Then we woke up, had a little nosh,
watched The House of Sand and Fog again,

241
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,615
with commentary.

242
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:23,816
The director was an ass.

243
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,385
Fine. But how do you explain this?

244
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,589
Nice of you to think of me.
However, 'SB' could be anyone.

245
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:34,393
Scott Baio, the Sultan of Brunei,
the former Polish secret police,

246
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,724
the Sluzba Bezpieczenstwa. Or...

247
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,574
Marge, I miss you!

248
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,435
I miss you so much.

249
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,419
Wait till he finds out
the key isn't the key,

250
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,850
but just a hotter sauce.

251
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,621
Hmm?
- Hmm?

252
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,800
I'm gonna say this for the last time.

253
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,895
Bart, if this is one of your pranks,
very funny.

254
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:24,877
Maybe we should let him out soon.
- Not till Marge dumps him for good.

255
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:29,175
Hey, lame-o.
Ready for some fun with fire ants?

256
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:34,053
What's fun about fire ants?
They're... Oh. You're being sarcastic.

257
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,822
Wow. You're the smartest guy
in that room.

258
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:41,552
Thank you. That's very...
Oh! More sarcasm.

259
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:46,977
Just see that my fiancée,
Marge, gets this,

260
00:17:47,077 --> 00:17:48,267
my wedding vows.

261
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:53,472
'Marge, I hope this day is as perfect
for you as the day we met was for me.

262
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:58,043
'You always find the one grain of sugar
in the saltshaker that is I.

263
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,579
'With each marriage,
I get a little better.

264
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,615
'Maybe after a thousand,
I'll be worthy of you.'

265
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:09,325
I miss you. I miss the kids.
God help me, I even miss your sisters!

266
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:18,027
Poor guy.
- He loves her so much.

267
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,098
Excuse me.

268
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:23,469
But I have been waiting 45 minutes
for you to slide my license over to me.

269
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,570
Closed!

270
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,705
Okay, you are hereby
banned from my store.

271
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,408
You will have to shop at the Kwik-E-Mart
across the street from me!

272
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,543
You know, the much nicer,
much newer one.

273
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,643
Good day to you!

274
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,682
Mom! Mom! We know where Dad is.

275
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,518
He's right here.
- I'm not sure what happened.

276
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,747
I was kidnapped, then tortured,

277
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:44,890
then I fell into a
surprisingly sound sleep.

278
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,159
When I awoke, I felt refreshed.

279
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,594
Then I was blindfolded,

280
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:52,965
and two sobbing trolls
threw me out of a van onto our lawn.

281
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm just happy you're back.

282
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,969
Now let's get that chain off you.

283
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:00,172
Won't it dry up in a few days
and fall off in the bath?

284
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,482
I've missed your nonsense.

285
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,621
Now there's no evidence
to tie us to the kidnapping.

286
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,757
And we've got a one-year lease
on that torture room.

287
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,926
So maybe we can put
a tanning bed in there.

288
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,963
We know it was you, Selma Bouvier!

289
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:35,240
Would you kids like cookies?
Let your Auntie Patty make some cookies.

290
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,975
We don't want your cookies.

291
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,445
What she means is,
we'll eat your cookies later.

292
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,080
If you don't want us
to tell our mom what you did,

293
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,414
you're gonna have to pay.

294
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,249
Pay? Pay for what?

295
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:48,687
Ask her. She's the brains.
I'm the thing that's not the brains.

296
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,950
And with the inking and
application of this...

297
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,328
...stamp, you are
officially married. Next.

298
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:57,696
I'm sorry, honey.

299
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,666
I wanted so badly to give you
a fancy wedding.

300
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,302
Homer, one thing I've learned is that...

301
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:08,474
...you don't need a fancy wedding
when you're marrying the man you love.

302
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,574

303
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,829
Just what I always wanted!

304
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:28,018
A rocket ship wedding cake!
Just what I always wanted!

305
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:31,656
We emptied our 401s for this?

306
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,323
Zoom. Zoom.

307
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,300
Oh! Blue roses!

308
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,105
Yes. It took a lot of
frantic genetic engineering,

309
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,306
but enjoy.

310
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,507
No! You're a plant now!
