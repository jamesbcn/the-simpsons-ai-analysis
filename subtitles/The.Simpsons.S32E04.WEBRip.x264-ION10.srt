1
00:00:10,822 --> 00:00:12,659
Now, listen up,
we've got an election to run,

2
00:00:12,726 --> 00:00:16,634
under the strict supervision of
heavily‐medicated octogenarians.

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,706
I'm gonna need to see
three forms of ID.

4
00:00:19,773 --> 00:00:22,579
12 if you're a Democrat.

5
00:00:24,115 --> 00:00:25,785
Homer, get down here.

6
00:00:25,852 --> 00:00:28,891
Your vote for president
has never been more important.

7
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:32,498
That's today?

8
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,005
So vague.

9
00:00:36,072 --> 00:00:37,809
You'll get down here this minute

10
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:40,748
if you care about
the three things you love most.

11
00:00:43,554 --> 00:00:45,825
Are you picturing the kids?

12
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:48,163
Yes, honey mustard.

13
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:53,975
Hmm, let's see.

14
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:57,314
I know who I want for all
the judges and propositions.

15
00:00:57,381 --> 00:01:00,655
But president...
that's a stumper.

16
00:01:00,722 --> 00:01:02,157
Can I write in Judge Judy?

17
00:01:02,224 --> 00:01:03,961
You're hesitating
over president?

18
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:06,834
Dad. By all that's decent,
how could you forget

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,940
everything that's happened
the last four years?

20
00:01:12,177 --> 00:01:15,685
I don't know. Not sure
what you're talking about.

21
00:01:16,854 --> 00:01:17,956
Oh, yeah.

22
00:01:18,023 --> 00:01:19,960
Well, that one was just funny.

23
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:24,670
That was bad.

24
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,972
That was worse.

25
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,842
Someone made that up.

26
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:29,445
Yike.

27
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:31,784
I got to do something.

28
00:01:37,595 --> 00:01:40,400
Who you gonna make fun of now,

29
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,204
late night comics?

30
00:01:47,014 --> 00:01:49,018
You slept all day?

31
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:51,623
- You didn't vote?
- Hey, how bad could it be?

32
00:01:57,602 --> 00:02:00,942
You owe me
a new pair of glasses.

33
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:04,381
That's what I get
for voting for Kanye!

34
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:32,370
Bart, have you finished packing
your old toys for charity?

35
00:02:32,437 --> 00:02:35,343
Almost. I just want a minute
to say goodbye.

36
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,882
Oh, of course.

37
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,553
Goodbye.

38
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:45,563
<i>You put a dent</i>

39
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,969
<i>In me</i>

40
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:52,144
<i>You soaked my head in pee</i>

41
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,550
<i>Then you set my feet
on fire</i>

42
00:02:55,617 --> 00:02:59,525
<i>And you threw me
under your front tire</i>

43
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:01,930
<i>I'm basically an invalid</i>

44
00:03:01,997 --> 00:03:04,067
<i>Boy, you are a rotten kid</i>

45
00:03:04,134 --> 00:03:07,707
<i>I know everything you did</i>

46
00:03:07,774 --> 00:03:12,150
<i>Yeah, you are a rotten kid</i>

47
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:19,598
<i>You got no redeeming qualities</i>

48
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:24,041
Did you enjoy
saying goodbye to your toys?

49
00:03:24,107 --> 00:03:26,111
Oh, yeah. I'm a real sweetie.

50
00:03:26,178 --> 00:03:27,882
Yes, you are.

51
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:30,019
So, as your reward...

52
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:32,791
The new Radioactive Man
action figure!

53
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:34,361
With real radioactivity!

54
00:03:36,365 --> 00:03:39,004
Oh, thanks, Mom.
Just keep away from scrotum.

55
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:41,041
Grampa,
where's your scrotum?

56
00:03:41,108 --> 00:03:44,281
I think
it's in my other pants.

57
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:50,026
Finally, a sweet and kind boy
of my own.

58
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:51,795
Sweet and kind?

59
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:54,668
He's the reason Jack
won't come out of his box.

60
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,572
Is he out there?

61
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,409
Why don't you see for yourself?

62
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:02,183
Crank it back! Crank it back!

63
00:04:05,723 --> 00:04:07,060
Want more proof?

64
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:12,938
Meet Over‐Stretched Arm‐Long,
Tickled‐Out Elmeaux,

65
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:15,944
and Headless Malibu Stacy.

66
00:04:16,011 --> 00:04:19,318
Hey, creep.
My eyes are down here.

67
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,055
Hey, hey, Radioactive Man,

68
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:22,958
there's a bomb in that safe

69
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:25,330
and you're the only one
who can disarm it.

70
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:27,167
Piece of cake.

71
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,970
Uranium cake.

72
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:34,481
Bart, you have to see this.

73
00:04:34,548 --> 00:04:36,094
They just dumped some mail
on the street

74
00:04:36,118 --> 00:04:38,255
and there's mail
blowing everywhere.

75
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:43,232
Insides melting.

76
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:45,269
Decals loosening.

77
00:04:45,336 --> 00:04:48,944
I will have my rev...

78
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,217
Homer, always put
a paper towel over...

79
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:54,856
It's wine time.

80
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:03,672
His accessories
will go to his widow.

81
00:05:05,109 --> 00:05:08,783
His widow was a monkey?
Love is love.

82
00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:12,657
We've got to fight back.

83
00:05:14,194 --> 00:05:15,831
When I'm through with him,

84
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:19,237
his teeth
will be sold separately.

85
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:21,575
Even you hate him,

86
00:05:21,642 --> 00:05:23,345
gift that was never unwrapped?

87
00:05:23,412 --> 00:05:25,984
So much anger.

88
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:28,456
I always thought
you were just a sweater.

89
00:05:28,522 --> 00:05:30,226
Hey! Ow! Oh!

90
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:32,664
We now return to
The Swellest Slum,

91
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,138
the musical romp starring
Debbie Reynolds as Rosie,

92
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:38,275
the Puerto Rican seamstress.

93
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:40,881
Don't tell me we have to walk
through all the booze bags

94
00:05:40,948 --> 00:05:42,550
in the Irish district.

95
00:05:42,617 --> 00:05:44,197
And we won't be showing
that movie anymore.

96
00:05:44,221 --> 00:05:48,028
Coming up next on TCM, nothing.

97
00:05:52,337 --> 00:05:54,809
Where am I?
Who are you?

98
00:05:57,247 --> 00:05:59,919
My toys.
You're alive?

99
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:04,060
Bart Simpson, I'm gonna do
what clowns do best.

100
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:05,563
Kill.

101
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,968
Look, guys, I would have
never treated you bad

102
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,039
if I'd known you had feelings.

103
00:06:10,106 --> 00:06:12,610
You treat me bad
and you know I have feelings.

104
00:06:12,677 --> 00:06:14,047
You're in on this too?

105
00:06:14,114 --> 00:06:16,986
They've got Puppy Goo Goo!

106
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:20,894
They don't have me.
I ran away, loser.

107
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:24,634
Ay, caramba!

108
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:27,140
Malibu Stacy?

109
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:29,311
That's Dr. Malibu Stacy to you.

110
00:06:29,377 --> 00:06:33,887
I specialize in
plastic surgery.

111
00:06:34,721 --> 00:06:36,792
You kill like a girl.

112
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,772
Bart? Bart?

113
00:06:45,109 --> 00:06:47,480
What happened to you?

114
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:50,988
I'm Bart Simpson.

115
00:06:51,054 --> 00:06:52,690
Let's watch
what you want to watch.

116
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:57,968
Well, it's pretty
straightforward.

117
00:06:58,035 --> 00:06:59,571
Bart's bones are Tinkertoys,

118
00:06:59,638 --> 00:07:00,941
he has a Build‐A‐Bear heart

119
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:03,479
and his brain is Pop Rocks
and Silly Putty.

120
00:07:05,116 --> 00:07:07,921
How did this happen?

121
00:07:07,988 --> 00:07:09,557
Don't ask, don't Mattel.

122
00:07:09,624 --> 00:07:11,929
Bart, son, speak to me.

123
00:07:11,996 --> 00:07:15,169
I'm Bart Simpson.
I love my mother and father.

124
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:18,275
We've lost him.

125
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,955
- No!
- No.

126
00:07:29,197 --> 00:07:32,938
<i>This is the end of Bart</i>

127
00:07:33,005 --> 00:07:36,478
<i>He lost his human parts</i>

128
00:07:37,313 --> 00:07:41,221
<i>Now he's nothing but
a big ol' toy</i>

129
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:44,995
<i>Lost his chance
to be a human boy</i>

130
00:07:45,062 --> 00:07:46,966
<i>He's sweet and kind</i>

131
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,137
<i>But he's got no mind</i>

132
00:07:49,204 --> 00:07:52,677
<i>This is the end of Bart</i>

133
00:07:52,744 --> 00:07:56,451
<i>This is the end of Bart</i>

134
00:07:57,386 --> 00:08:00,326
<i>Happy trails, Bart</i>

135
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:12,383
Y'ello?

136
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,920
Homer, where are you?

137
00:08:13,987 --> 00:08:15,991
It's Halloween
and we need the candy.

138
00:08:16,057 --> 00:08:18,695
Who ate all the candy?

139
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,792
Got to get more candy.

140
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,198
Advil?

141
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:39,304
Trick or treat.

142
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:44,581
Advil?
You know what this means.

143
00:08:44,647 --> 00:08:46,167
Hey, you kids did say
trick or treat,

144
00:08:46,218 --> 00:08:48,890
so it's totally legal.

145
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:54,467
No candy? No candy.

146
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,075
Aren't you supposed to be
fattening us up?

147
00:08:58,141 --> 00:09:01,047
I like my children
stringy and tough.

148
00:09:07,793 --> 00:09:09,030
No one's allowed in here!

149
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:10,499
Then what are you doing in here?

150
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:12,069
You're right.

151
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:17,079
Want some more, punk?

152
00:09:18,382 --> 00:09:20,719
Listen, machine,
there's no evidence

153
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:22,556
that you contain any candy
or take any money.

154
00:09:22,623 --> 00:09:26,665
But desperate times
call for something something.

155
00:09:29,437 --> 00:09:31,943
The fact that
you won't take my quarter

156
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:33,312
proves you have candy.

157
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:41,795
Hey, Boo Boo,

158
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:44,367
let's go steal a picnic meal.

159
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:46,939
- Who the heck are you?
- I'm Homer‐Barbera,

160
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:49,444
a‐smarter than
the average Homer.

161
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:54,120
You sound just like
an actor named Art Carney.

162
00:09:54,187 --> 00:09:56,892
Don't tell his estate.

163
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,105
Oh, I'm ever so sorry.

164
00:10:03,171 --> 00:10:04,171
Who are you?

165
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:06,745
I'm Disney Princess Homer.

166
00:10:08,515 --> 00:10:11,621
Okay, from now on,
you just sing.

167
00:10:13,091 --> 00:10:16,031
<i>D'oh</i>

168
00:10:16,097 --> 00:10:18,635
Heavens to Murgatroyd.

169
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,039
What's Murgatroyd?

170
00:10:20,105 --> 00:10:21,909
A‐nobody knows.

171
00:10:25,682 --> 00:10:26,819
Konnichiwa!

172
00:10:26,886 --> 00:10:29,190
This case is gonna be
like Homer's skull.

173
00:10:29,257 --> 00:10:32,296
Hard to crack
and not much inside.

174
00:10:32,363 --> 00:10:34,700
Of all the wonders
a multiverse might reveal,

175
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,440
ours is giving us
multiple Homer Simpsons.

176
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:39,477
Six versions
of the local loudmouth

177
00:10:39,544 --> 00:10:41,614
are terrorizing the town.

178
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:43,227
Family‐style buffets
have been emptied of everything

179
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:44,988
except salad.

180
00:10:45,055 --> 00:10:47,793
The bowling alleys
have been overbowled.

181
00:10:47,861 --> 00:10:49,130
And the library?

182
00:10:49,197 --> 00:10:50,466
Untouched.

183
00:10:50,532 --> 00:10:52,269
Then they attended
a hockey game.

184
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:55,810
Krusty Burger has had to look
for other sources of meat.

185
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:59,083
Hey! What's this new gig
I'm going to?

186
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,221
Because...

187
00:11:02,256 --> 00:11:04,928
They even started
a doo‐wop group.

188
00:11:04,995 --> 00:11:06,331
<i>Lollipop, lollipop</i>

189
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:07,934
<i>Oh, lolli, lolli‐la</i>

190
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:08,936
<i>Lollipop</i>

191
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:12,844
<i>Ba‐dum‐bum‐bum</i>

192
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:15,984
We've got to bring those Homies
here, where they'll be safe.

193
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,520
How you gonna do that?

194
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,827
Well, I'll be!

195
00:11:20,894 --> 00:11:23,198
Which one of you
will give your old dad a hug?

196
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,567
- Not me.
- Not me.

197
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:25,569
Not me.

198
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:26,771
Hell no!

199
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,210
I wonder
if this has anything to do

200
00:11:29,277 --> 00:11:32,817
with that quantum flash
of celestial energy.

201
00:11:36,224 --> 00:11:37,693
Little girl,

202
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,434
people might understand you
better if you sang.

203
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:45,042
<i>Look at this</i>

204
00:11:45,108 --> 00:11:47,580
<i>A flash in the sky</i>

205
00:11:47,646 --> 00:11:48,548
Oh, brother.

206
00:11:48,615 --> 00:11:50,152
<i>Will it open up</i>

207
00:11:50,219 --> 00:11:52,924
<i>And drop me a guy?</i>

208
00:11:52,991 --> 00:11:57,132
<i>I want to be
where the Twinkies are</i>

209
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:58,468
Dad!

210
00:11:58,535 --> 00:12:00,172
<i>Where the fruit pies lie</i>

211
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:02,844
<i>And the Ding Dongs do it</i>

212
00:12:02,911 --> 00:12:04,247
Fine.

213
00:12:04,313 --> 00:12:06,050
<i>Dad</i>

214
00:12:06,117 --> 00:12:10,158
<i>You tore a hole
in the space‐time continuum</i>

215
00:12:11,862 --> 00:12:15,168
<i>Allowing Homers
from other dimensions</i>

216
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,371
<i>To seep into</i>

217
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:19,543
<i>Our universe</i>

218
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,249
Happy Halloween‐o, neighborino.

219
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:24,320
Eat lead, Ned.

220
00:12:24,387 --> 00:12:26,391
I forgive you!

221
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:31,401
<i>Eat</i>

222
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:35,208
<i>The bacon</i>

223
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:42,432
- Megatron.
- Pass the potatoes.

224
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:45,863
This is so hard,
feeding all of you at once.

225
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,468
Yeah? Try following them all
into the bathroom.

226
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,739
Why, you little...

227
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,186
Dad, by Harlan Ellison's law
of circular storytelling,

228
00:12:57,252 --> 00:12:59,858
all of you Homers have
to get back to the nuclear plant

229
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:02,696
and recreate the energy burst
that brought you here.

230
00:13:02,763 --> 00:13:04,300
- Or what?
- You're gonna die!

231
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,072
Again and again
and again and again.

232
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:09,009
That doesn't sound so bad.

233
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:10,712
And again.

234
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:15,088
Quarter. Quarter. Quarter.

235
00:13:15,155 --> 00:13:16,457
Not so fast.

236
00:13:16,524 --> 00:13:19,730
Exit‐a, stage left.

237
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,403
I can't let you
close the portal.

238
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,941
It's the ultimate form
of cheap undocumented labor.

239
00:13:25,008 --> 00:13:26,778
Sure, you get a couple of these.

240
00:13:28,114 --> 00:13:29,283
But it's worth it.

241
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,320
You can't stop us,
corpse blossom.

242
00:13:31,387 --> 00:13:33,625
There's one of you
and six of us.

243
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:36,330
Really?
Would you like to count again?

244
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:42,543
Burnsiverse versus Homerverse.

245
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:45,715
And the Smitherverse
to nod and take copious notes.

246
00:14:06,157 --> 00:14:07,459
Excellent.

247
00:14:07,526 --> 00:14:09,497
Each of you is more evil
than the last.

248
00:14:09,563 --> 00:14:12,102
But I'm still
the richest, right?

249
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:13,471
In my dimension,

250
00:14:13,538 --> 00:14:14,808
you're Smithers' sidekick.

251
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,611
In that case...

252
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:29,103
Finally.
I'm with the only Homer

253
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,140
I ever wanted.

254
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:32,709
Say, sweetheart,

255
00:14:32,776 --> 00:14:34,613
park your lips in this garage.

256
00:14:38,121 --> 00:14:40,458
Heavens to Marge‐atroyd!

257
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:43,832
Exit‐a, stage right!

258
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:53,194
<i>Gotta get up,
gotta get out, gotta get home</i>

259
00:14:53,618 --> 00:14:55,155
<i>Before the morning comes</i>

260
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,125
<i>What if I'm late,
got a big date</i>

261
00:14:57,192 --> 00:15:00,432
<i>Gotta get home
before the sun comes up</i>

262
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:02,369
Dear log, at midnight,

263
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:05,075
I turn nine,
halfway to adulthood.

264
00:15:05,141 --> 00:15:08,181
Am I ready
to put Night Night Moon

265
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:10,820
in the hand‐me‐down box?

266
00:15:13,993 --> 00:15:16,597
Lisa! We're about to
cut the cake!

267
00:15:16,664 --> 00:15:18,902
Come down before your father
steals some icing

268
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:19,904
with his finger!

269
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:20,873
Too late!

270
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,378
Buck up, former kiddo.

271
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:27,052
You just have to get through
another disappointing party.

272
00:15:41,882 --> 00:15:43,184
Worm. Snake.

273
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:45,221
Cigar. Two‐by‐four.

274
00:15:46,724 --> 00:15:48,194
Nice party, Lisa.

275
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:51,233
Didn't realize
the theme was being a loser.

276
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,239
My party is not full of losers.

277
00:15:54,306 --> 00:15:56,277
I can burp magic.

278
00:15:57,512 --> 00:16:00,118
Somebody kill me now.

279
00:16:06,263 --> 00:16:08,701
Oh, my God! I'm alive!

280
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,271
It must have been a dream.

281
00:16:10,338 --> 00:16:12,977
Lisa! We're about to
cut the cake!

282
00:16:13,044 --> 00:16:15,348
Come down before your father
steals some icing

283
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:16,350
with his finger!

284
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:17,786
Too late!

285
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:20,191
Worm. Snake.

286
00:16:20,258 --> 00:16:22,696
Cigar. Two‐by‐four.

287
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:25,201
Everything's the same.

288
00:16:25,268 --> 00:16:26,771
Nice party, Lisa.

289
00:16:26,838 --> 00:16:28,141
Didn't realize the theme was...

290
00:16:28,207 --> 00:16:29,276
Save it, Sherri.

291
00:16:29,343 --> 00:16:30,645
I'm not a loser.

292
00:16:30,712 --> 00:16:32,783
How did she know
what I was gonna say?

293
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,288
- Are we that predictable?
- Are we that predictable?

294
00:16:35,355 --> 00:16:37,659
I changed what happened.

295
00:16:37,726 --> 00:16:41,133
Which means
I can change my fate.

296
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,904
Sorry, Milhouse.

297
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:46,410
My inside's full of owies!

298
00:16:46,477 --> 00:16:47,947
Okay, you killed a kid.

299
00:16:48,014 --> 00:16:51,922
You better do really well
on the written portion.

300
00:16:51,988 --> 00:16:54,894
How do you like me now, karma?

301
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:56,730
We need to talk.

302
00:16:56,797 --> 00:16:58,836
Not now.
I just escaped death.

303
00:16:58,902 --> 00:17:00,405
It's so exhilarating.

304
00:17:00,471 --> 00:17:03,411
I can grow up
and create a cure for...

305
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,387
Back at the same beginning?

306
00:17:08,454 --> 00:17:09,723
Okay. Okay.

307
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,969
I can solve this,
I can solve this,

308
00:17:10,993 --> 00:17:13,130
I can solve this!

309
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:20,678
Okay. To repeat,

310
00:17:20,745 --> 00:17:23,952
I can solve this.

311
00:17:28,394 --> 00:17:29,529
Lisa!

312
00:17:29,596 --> 00:17:31,166
I know! I know!

313
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:33,170
Dad's gonna steal some icing!

314
00:17:33,237 --> 00:17:34,172
Too late!

315
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:35,541
Got to talk fast.

316
00:17:35,608 --> 00:17:36,477
We're both caught
in repeating time loops

317
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:37,746
where we die at the end.

318
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:39,416
I can burp magic.

319
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:40,853
Take two steps back, Ralph.

320
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,890
Okay.

321
00:17:45,996 --> 00:17:46,831
Trust me.

322
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:49,603
That helps us on so many levels.

323
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,175
Hey, maybe we're supposed
to work together

324
00:17:52,242 --> 00:17:53,244
to save each other.

325
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:55,214
Boo‐yeah!

326
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,855
I guess that means

327
00:17:58,922 --> 00:18:01,828
I have to throw myself
into the wood chipper?

328
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:03,698
Okay.

329
00:18:03,764 --> 00:18:05,168
There's other alternatives!

330
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:06,972
Now you tell me!

331
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:08,942
<i>Gotta get up, gotta get out</i>

332
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:12,349
<i>Gotta get home
before the morning comes</i>

333
00:18:12,415 --> 00:18:14,286
<i>What if I'm late,
got a big date</i>

334
00:18:14,353 --> 00:18:17,994
<i>Gotta get home
before the sun comes up</i>

335
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,730
<i>Up and away, got a big day</i>

336
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:21,300
<i>Sorry can't stay</i>

337
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,736
<i>I gotta run</i>

338
00:18:22,803 --> 00:18:25,174
That's what I forgot
to screw in.

339
00:18:25,976 --> 00:18:27,445
I'm glad we don't stay dead,

340
00:18:27,512 --> 00:18:29,216
but this is getting
pretty annoying.

341
00:18:29,282 --> 00:18:30,218
We need help.

342
00:18:30,284 --> 00:18:31,453
Yes, we do.

343
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,024
And there's one man in town

344
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,628
who can help us
with time and eternity.

345
00:18:39,236 --> 00:18:40,738
Yes, you've come
to the right place.

346
00:18:40,806 --> 00:18:42,475
The temporal loop
is simultaneously

347
00:18:42,542 --> 00:18:45,916
the most ambitious and laziest
of the science fiction tropes.

348
00:18:45,983 --> 00:18:47,685
Now, let me look
at my black mirror.

349
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:48,922
That's not a reference.

350
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:51,026
It's just...
It's filthy.

351
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:54,166
So, how do we break the cycle?

352
00:18:54,232 --> 00:18:56,136
I can tell you
what you seek to know,

353
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:57,505
but my price is...

354
00:18:57,572 --> 00:18:58,707
One breakfast burrito,

355
00:18:58,774 --> 00:18:59,811
all yolk, double bacon.

356
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:01,346
How did you...

357
00:19:01,413 --> 00:19:03,751
Because this isn't the first
time we've come to you.

358
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:06,156
We've given you 987 burritos.

359
00:19:06,223 --> 00:19:10,198
Wait, well, let's make it
a round thousand, shall we?

360
00:19:12,602 --> 00:19:14,206
All right.
Here you go.

361
00:19:14,272 --> 00:19:17,645
Temporal loops are broken
by being nice in Groundhog Day,

362
00:19:17,712 --> 00:19:19,649
saving the whales
in Star Trek IV,

363
00:19:19,716 --> 00:19:22,155
saying, orange, you glad
I didn't say banana?

364
00:19:22,222 --> 00:19:23,657
In the knock‐knock joke.

365
00:19:23,724 --> 00:19:25,437
And in the case
of the movie Edge of Tomorrow,

366
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:27,565
it was stopped
by poor box office.

367
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:29,136
I suspect Tom Cruise fatigue.

368
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:31,707
Very... very deadly.

369
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:33,711
But we've tried all those.

370
00:19:33,777 --> 00:19:35,715
I know this.
You two must each

371
00:19:35,781 --> 00:19:36,818
use your special powers

372
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:37,885
to help the other,

373
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,558
like Superman and Batman.

374
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,961
Okay. I've got it.

375
00:19:42,028 --> 00:19:44,266
My special power is insight,

376
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:45,936
and my insight into you is

377
00:19:46,003 --> 00:19:48,307
we need to find
your missing father.

378
00:19:48,374 --> 00:19:51,613
Or we could just kill Gil.

379
00:19:54,286 --> 00:19:55,555
38‐degree angle!

380
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:00,598
We're alive.

381
00:20:00,665 --> 00:20:02,735
The loop is broken!

382
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:05,741
So, I guess we go back
to the way things were.

383
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:07,345
I'll miss you.

384
00:20:07,412 --> 00:20:08,882
Thank you, Nelson.

385
00:20:08,949 --> 00:20:10,986
You helped me be okay
with turning nine.

386
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:12,755
Once I get out of this loop,

387
00:20:12,823 --> 00:20:15,061
I have the rest of my life
ahead of me.

388
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:18,200
And, as usual,
I've learned nothing!

389
00:20:24,112 --> 00:20:27,285
Mom, I learned something
really important.

390
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,888
No day is ever perfect,

391
00:20:28,955 --> 00:20:31,928
so just enjoy the day
that you have.

392
00:20:31,995 --> 00:20:34,532
Happy birthday, Lisa!

393
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:36,904
I'm finally nine!

394
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:39,442
And the universe
is back to normal.

395
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:44,119
Now I can watch
the food go in and out.
