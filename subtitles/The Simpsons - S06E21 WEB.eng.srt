1
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:06,131
The Simpsons.

2
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,626
This bus has seen
better days.

3
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,587
Well, at least it's
safer than the old bus.

4
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,510
Uh-oh. Time to move.

5
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,304
The hole's getting bigger.

6
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,936
Seymour, the children are
playing in the hole again.

7
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,813
Shouldn't you
get that fixed?

8
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,791
Edna, you know they just cut
the school's budget.

9
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,025
Besides, if I had the money,

10
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,735
I'd fix the exhaust leak
in the back.

11
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,237
Frankly, I think it's causing
some of our low test scores.

12
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,413
All right. The battlefield
is just a half mile ahead.

13
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,623
Begin braking procedure!

14
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,008
This civil war cannon
has been fully restored

15
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,177
and is in
ready-to-fire condition,

16
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,763
but it's good thing
we're not firing it.

17
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,890
Because it happens to be aimed

18
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,893
at the main support leg
of that lookout tower.

19
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,311
People don't realize

20
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,688
that cannons are
very sensitive,

21
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,358
and the slightest jolt
could set them off.

22
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,571
Of course,
for safety reasons,

23
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,907
we don't keep
the cannon loaded.

24
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,492
It's just common sense.

25
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,205
Otto, why don't you
get some more gas?

26
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,916
Here's the credit card.

27
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,752
And a mint
for afterwards.

28
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,212
Five dollars a child?!

29
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,214
Last year it was free.

30
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,799
Hmph. New ownership.

31
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,597
But we don't have
that kind of money.

32
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,474
In fact, no school
could afford the...

33
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:32,152
Here's the admission,
plus something for you.

34
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,946
See that they get a little
extra education, would you?

35
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,990
Yes, sir, Principal Valiant.

36
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:40,034
He thinks he's so hot ever since
he swept the Princi awards.

37
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,078
Those things are rigged.

38
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,915
On May 21, 1864,

39
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,334
the men of the
Ninth Bearded infantry

40
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:52,255
were sunning and fluffing
their beards in the sun.

41
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:56,009
Suddenly, enemy troops
crested that hill over there.

42
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,928
Fort Springfield,
we surrender unconditionally!

43
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,639
We're sick!
We need leeches!

44
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,350
And hacksaws to saw off
our gangrenous limbs!

45
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,144
But the Springfield brigade

46
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,646
was too brave to
accept the surrender.

47
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,064
Come on, boys.

48
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,025
Those white flags are
no match for our muskets!

49
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,860
Charge!

50
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,946
And the Springfielders
heroically slaughtered

51
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,866
their enemies
as they prayed for mercy.

52
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,288
It's hard to see
what's going on.

53
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,498
I can only make out
the fat soldiers.

54
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,833
All right, children,
switch.

55
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,631
Hey, they're trying
to learn for free!

56
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,714
Get them!

57
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,759
Use your phony guns as clubs!

58
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,093
Run, children!

59
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:43,640
Start the bus, Otto!
Start the bus!

60
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,642
Damn.

61
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,561
I shouldn't have eaten
the mint first.

62
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,564
Okay. Hop on.

63
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,858
Wait! Wait!

64
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,120
Well, Seymour, because of
your penny-pinching,

65
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,956
we're coming back
from a field trip

66
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,374
with the fewest
children yet.

67
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:13,253
God bless the man who
invented permission slips.

68
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,422
Uh, I think I
got your lunch.

69
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,733
Oh, yeah. I didn't think
this was for me.

70
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,306
Seymour, the teachers
are fed up.

71
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,934
You have to start putting
money back into the school.

72
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,769
You've cut back
on everything...

73
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,813
Salaries, supplies, the food.

74
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:35,733
I don't care what you say,
I can taste the newspaper.

75
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,068
Posh. Shredded newspapers

76
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,737
add much-needed roughage
and essential inks.

77
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,407
Besides, you didn't
notice the old gym mats.

78
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,368
There's very little meat
in these gym mats.

79
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,370
Our demands
are very reasonable.

80
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,163
By ignoring them,

81
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,082
you're selling out
these children's futures.

82
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,417
Oh, come on, Edna!

83
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,252
We both know these children
have no future.

84
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,091
Prove me wrong, kids.

85
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,468
Prove me wrong.

86
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:06,180
I've never seen them
fight like that, Bart.

87
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,384
I'm worried that all this posturing
and saber rattling

88
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,892
could lead to
a teachers' strike.

89
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,976
Strike, eh?

90
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,064
My bones are so brittle.

91
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,567
But I always drink plenty of...

92
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,361
"malk"?

93
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,364
How do you expect us
to teach with these supplies?

94
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,658
This pointer's so old,
it's worn down to a nub.

95
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,244
It still points,
doesn't it?

96
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,871
Stop that!

97
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,040
And look at this.
The only books we have

98
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,208
are ones that were banned
by other schools.

99
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,545
Well, the kids
have to learn

100
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,839
about "Tek War"
sooner or later.

101
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,425
Go away, Bart,
this is not a good time.

102
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,260
I saw you two fighting.

103
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,446
I'm worried
there could be a strike

104
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,055
and the school would shut down.

105
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,640
I'm sure you'd
really hate that.

106
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,517
There's not going
to be a strike, Bart.

107
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,228
Yeah. Skinner says
you wouldn't have

108
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,622
the won tons to go
through with it.

109
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,856
Skinner said that?

110
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,816
Well, I had to
clean it up a little.

111
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,443
But basically,
Krabappel said

112
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,237
you'd give the teachers
everything they want.

113
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,365
- She did?
- Yeah. She said

114
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,492
you'd fold faster than
Superman on laundry day.

115
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,036
We'll see about that.

116
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,038
Simpson,
I always thought you were

117
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,121
sneaky and manipulative.

118
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,916
But now I see

119
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,210
you're really a very
sensitive little boy.

120
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,213
Thank you, sir.

121
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,648
Seymour,
you're being totally unfair,

122
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,633
and the teachers
won't stand for it.

123
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:27,095
Teachers, you don't have
the guts to strike!

124
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,681
You don't have the guts
to take us all on!

125
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,355
- That's it!
- Stee-rike!

126
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,317
Attention.

127
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,528
This is
an emergency broadcast.

128
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,905
All is well in the school.

129
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,533
My authority as principal
is total...

130
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,993
Hey, give me that!

131
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,789
Attention, teachers.
We're on strike. Ha!

132
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,708
Oh, no. A strike?

133
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,335
Miss Hoover, are you on...

134
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,380
Go home, children!

135
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,383
Hello?

136
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:09,554
Mrs. Pommelhorst?

137
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,764
I'd like to get down now.

138
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,439
Hey, now that
Largo's gone,

139
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,066
we can play the
forbidden music.

140
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,406
I heard that!

141
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,794
Bart, Lisa, what are
you two doing home so early?

142
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,421
Great news, Mom!

143
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,797
Horrible news, Mom!

144
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,299
The school's on strike!

145
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,842
Maybe forever!

146
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,219
Oh! Overload!
Pleasure overload!

147
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,365
Luckily, I've prepared
for this,

148
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,849
so I'm not too worried.

149
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,856
Sit up straight.
Eyes forward.

150
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,232
No talking.

151
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,276
Is that gum?
Is that gum?

152
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,652
Is that gum?

153
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,030
Oh, yeah. Phew!

154
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,574
Bart,
leave that crowbar here.

155
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,910
You know I don't like you
prying and jimmying.

156
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,078
Mom! Dad! Great news!
The teachers...

157
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,371
We heard.

158
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,624
And we already
hired a tutor.

159
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,501
Well, looks like
we'll be staying late today

160
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,920
to make up for all this
dillydallying.

161
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,059
Awesome.

162
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,312
You, with the crane!

163
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,438
Spin around real fast!

164
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,111
Now you!

165
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,405
Dump three tons of sand
onto that Porta-Potty.

166
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,496
Hey! Can't you tell my voice

167
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,331
from a ten-year-old kid's?

168
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,707
Ay, caramba!

169
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,141
Hey, that little boy

170
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,518
is playing three games
at once.

171
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,728
- Checkmate.
- Dang.

172
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,900
Lousy teachers trying
to palm off our kids on us.

173
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,402
But, Dad, by striking,

174
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,921
they're trying to effect
a change in management

175
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,823
so they can be happier
and more productive.

176
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,201
Lisa! If you don't like
your job, you don't strike.

177
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,788
You just go in every day
and do it really half-assed.

178
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,873
That's the American way.

179
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,876
I've got some textbooks, but
without state-approved syllabi

180
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,505
and standardized testing,
my education can only go so far.

181
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,591
Honey, maybe you should
relax a little.

182
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,384
Relax?! I can't relax!

183
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,678
Nor can I yield, relent or...

184
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,473
only two synonyms?!

185
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,975
Oh, my God!

186
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,311
I'm losing my perspicacity!

187
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,398
Well, it's always
in the last place you look.

188
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,113
So, if we were
in school this week,

189
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,449
what do you think
we'd be learning?

190
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,992
Get away from me.

191
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,453
Good news, people!

192
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,996
I'm happy to announce

193
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,915
that another union has joined us
in a sympathy strike...

194
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,792
The Piano Tuners Local 412!

195
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,925
Now, for operation
strike-make-go-longer.

196
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,720
You know, I heard
Skinner say

197
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,930
the teachers will crack
any minute.

198
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,020
Skinner said
the teachers will crack

199
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,122
any minute purple
monkey dishwasher.

200
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,023
Well! We'll show him...

201
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,442
Especially for that
purple monkey dishwasher remark.

202
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,198
Seymour, you are
truly incompetent.

203
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,991
Well, I hardly think
it's fair to...

204
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,119
Dummy up, you! Listen to
those passing motorists

205
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,496
who support
the teachers.

206
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,127
15 minute recess,
Milhouse.

207
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,963
The recess assignment is
chapters three through seven.

208
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,966
Yay! Recess!

209
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,260
Milhouse, I found a hive
of killer bees.

210
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,054
You want to go
throw rocks at it?

211
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,808
Sorry, Bart. I'm deeply immersed
in the Teapot Dome scandal.

212
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,267
However,

213
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,353
it might be
feasible in a fortnight.

214
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,313
- Wha...
- I can play in two weeks.

215
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,397
Juh?

216
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,653
I just can't believe.

217
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,905
Stark would stoop to that,

218
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,281
and right in the middle

219
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,618
of Montana
and Dakota's wedding.

220
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,706
All this free time.
I never thought

221
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,291
I'd get sick of "Razor Fight II:
The Slashening."

222
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,293
I probably should stop.
My doctor says

223
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,087
I have the wrists
of an 80-year-old.

224
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,802
What do you mean,
the bank is out of money?!

225
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,554
Insolvent!

226
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,306
You only have enough cash
for the next three customers?!

227
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,603
W-Wait a minute!

228
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,397
J-J-Just a second here!

229
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,899
No, no.
I don't have your money here.

230
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,820
It's in Bill's house
a-a-and Fred's house.

231
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,489
What the hell you doing with
my money in your house, Fred?

232
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,082
Grade me!
Look at me!

233
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,709
Evaluate and rank me!

234
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,879
Oh! I'm good, good, good,
and oh, so smart!

235
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,630
Grade me!

236
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,724
I'm worried about
the kids, Homie.

237
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,143
Lisa's becoming
very obsessive.

238
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,772
This morning I caught her trying
to dissect her own raincoat.

239
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,483
I know.

240
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,193
And this
perpetual motion machine

241
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,903
she made today is a joke.

242
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,489
It just keeps going
faster and faster.

243
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,824
Bart isn't doing
very well either.

244
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,076
He needs boundaries
and structure.

245
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,996
There's something about
flying a kite at night

246
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,581
that's so unwholesome.

247
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,709
Hello, Mother dear.

248
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,960
Oh, that's it!

249
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,796
We have to get them
back to school.

250
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,507
I'm with you, Marge.
Lisa, get in here!

251
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:24,345
In this house, we obey
the laws of thermodynamics!

252
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,491
All right, I'd like
to call this meeting

253
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,018
of the P.T.A.
to or-diddly-order,

254
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,538
and let's see if we can't put an end
to this strike fuss, huh?

255
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,273
Mrs. Krabappel,
why don't you begin?

256
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,443
Oh, boo yourself.

257
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,463
Our demands are simple:
A small cost-of-living increase

258
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,491
and some better equipment
and supplies for your children!

259
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,910
- Oh, that's easy!
- Give it to 'em!

260
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,203
Yeah, in a dream world.

261
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,080
We have a very
tight budget.

262
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,041
To do what she's asking,
we'd have to raise taxes.

263
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,086
- Raise taxes?
- They're too high as they are!

264
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,671
- I've had enough!
- Taxes are bad!

265
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,214
It's your
children's future!

266
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,299
- Oh, yeah!
- Children! Yes!

267
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,425
I forgot.

268
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,677
It'll cost ya.

269
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,136
No to taxes!

270
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,305
They're gonna
raise taxes!

271
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,723
Come on!

272
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,767
All right.
That's a good point.

273
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,102
Oh, yeah.
That sounds...

274
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,729
- Oh, yeah! The taxes!
- That means money.

275
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,566
The finger thing
means the taxes.

276
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,276
Well, I guess this is

277
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,778
a case where we'll have
to agree to disagree.

278
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,738
- I don't agree to that.
- Neither do I.

279
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,825
Oh, ho-ho! This is
a dilly of a pickle.

280
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,703
Oh, my God!
The P.T.A. has disbanded!

281
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,375
No, no! The P.T.A.
has not disbanded.

282
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,005
We do have
an emergency plan

283
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,757
in case of
a prolonged strike right here.

284
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,759
Let's see.

285
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:49,471
"Replace teachers with
super-intelligent cyborgs.

286
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,640
"Or, if cyborgs
aren't invented yet,

287
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,183
use people from
the neighborhood."

288
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,689
Talkin' out of turn,
that's a paddlin'.

289
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:03,485
Lookin' out the window,
that's a paddlin'.

290
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,489
Starin' at my sandals,
that's a paddlin'.

291
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,241
Paddlin' the school canoe...

292
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,994
Oh, you better believe
that's a paddlin'.

293
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,332
All right.

294
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,500
So the compression and expansion

295
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,878
of the longitudinal waves

296
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,671
cause the erratic oscillation...

297
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,298
You can see it there...

298
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,091
Of the neighboring
particles.

299
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,929
- Yes, what is it? What?
- Can I play with it?

300
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,513
No, you can't play with it!

301
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,357
You won't enjoy it
on as many levels as I do.

302
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,603
The colors, children.

303
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:42,483
Okay. When I call your name,
you say "present" or "here."

304
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,068
No, say present.

305
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,736
"Anita Bath..."

306
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,949
All right. Settle down.
Anita Bath here?

307
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,036
All right. Fine, fine.

308
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,788
Uh, "Maya Buttreeks."

309
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,711
Hey, what are you
laughing at? What?

310
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,213
Oh, oh, I get it.

311
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,923
I get it.

312
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,258
It's my big ears,
isn't it, kids?

313
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,802
Isn't it?!

314
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,222
Well, children,
I can't help that!

315
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,187
Wow, Bart!
I'm impressed

316
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,482
the way you knocked off
all those substitutes.

317
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,402
In my weaker moments,
I almost pity them.

318
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,364
Then I just remind myself:
They're trying to teach.

319
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,675
Well, children,
I don't know what you did

320
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,033
to all those substitutes,

321
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,829
but it's going to stop now!
Leopold?

322
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:40,499
All right. You listen up,
you little freaks!

323
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,334
The fun stops here.

324
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,253
You're gonna shut
your stinking traps

325
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,963
and behave, damn it!

326
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,298
This is one substitute
you're not gonna screw with!

327
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,342
Marge Simpson.

328
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,054
Hello, class!

329
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,016
Hi, Bart! Over here, sweetie!

330
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,394
It's me, Mom!
Hi. Hey! Hello!

331
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,653
Well, I'm sure
some of you know me.

332
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,988
I'm Bart Simpson's mother.

333
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,702
Mom!

334
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,871
Hey, Bart, what about
the booby trap?

335
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,711
- May I?
- Thank you.

336
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,796
- Mama's boy.
- Teacher's pet.

337
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,882
Goody-goody.

338
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,425
I meant
the other booby trap.

339
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,807
Kids have been doing that one
since my day.

340
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,937
So, how was
everybody's day at school?

341
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,481
- Horrifying.
- Pointless.

342
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,858
Exhausting.
It took the children 40 minutes

343
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,735
to locate Canada on the map.

344
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:53,238
Marge, anyone can miss Canada
all tucked away down there.

345
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,907
Well, my teacher's
a nightmare.

346
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,159
Three kids got sick from
inhaling his ointment fumes,

347
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,411
he confiscated everything
made of tin,

348
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,996
and then he sent us
home early

349
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,280
because he got his beard caught
in the pencil sharpener.

350
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,337
Oh. Oh, um... okay.

351
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,715
Um, here.

352
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,927
Oh. Okay, uh...

353
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,512
let's see, um...

354
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,263
what if I did this?

355
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,850
You're on your own.

356
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,730
There's no way I'll get
into an ivy league school now.

357
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,066
At this rate I probably
won't even get into Vassar.

358
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,068
I've had just about enough

359
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,278
of your Vassar bashing,
young lady.

360
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,780
Look, Mom,

361
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,907
it feels really weird
having you on my turf.

362
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,368
How would you feel
if I started mopping the floor?

363
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,370
I'd be thrilled. You can start right now.

364
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,580
And I'm gonna keep
teaching your class...

365
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,915
Like it or lump it.

366
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,084
Well, then,

367
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,921
I guess I'll just have to get
into the crawl space again.

368
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,965
I hate it when he gets in there.

369
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,517
Psst. Over here.

370
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,520
Mom, I need a dollar.

371
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,956
Ever since you
started teaching here,

372
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,207
kids have been taking
my lunch money.

373
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,692
And I need that money
for candy.

374
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,652
Aw, here you go, precious.

375
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,864
Now go off
with your friends.

376
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,907
Here you go, precious.

377
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,163
Why isn't my
mom stopping this?

378
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,582
We've created
a diversion.

379
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,085
That's a very
nice jig, Kearney.

380
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,588
Now, isn't dancing
much more fun than bullying?

381
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,671
Yeah.

382
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,052
That's it. I can't
take this anymore, Milhouse.

383
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,305
I got to get the
real teachers back.

384
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:45,184
Bart, you'll never get Krabappel
and Skinner together again.

385
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,103
They're like two
positively charged ions.

386
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,605
Zuh?

387
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,273
Wait! That's it.

388
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,233
With your book smarts,
and my ability

389
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,402
to exploit people
with book smarts,

390
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,363
we can figure out a clever plan
to get them back together.

391
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,825
A surprise party for me
in Principal Skinner's office?

392
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,494
Well, I don't know,
but all right.

393
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,622
Me? Go to my office?

394
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,291
It's highly irregular,
but all right.

395
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,002
And you're not coming out

396
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,420
until you reach an agreement.

397
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,172
Let us out, Bart!

398
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,216
This is not funny, Bart!

399
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,693
Stop it, Bart.
Let us out right now!

400
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,387
Don't worry.
They'll start negotiating.

401
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,265
Let us out!

402
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,059
For the love of God,
let us out!

403
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,019
Man, this is like 'Nam!

404
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,395
Let us out!

405
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,814
Come on, or you will
be so sorry!

406
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:43,909
You're going to be
verrrrry, very sorry!

407
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:47,246
Well, Seymour, I guess
we could start talking.

408
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,414
What's the point?
There's no more money

409
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,417
unless you've got some
magic new source of revenue.

410
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,294
Well, we've got to figure
something out.

411
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,064
They've got us locked in
here like prisoners.

412
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,757
Prisoners in
our own school.

413
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,808
This is a great way
to make extra money.

414
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:11,144
Renting out our cloakrooms to
the overcrowded prison system.

415
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,939
Yo. I used to sit
right over there.

416
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,987
It's all right, children.
Just ignore the murderer.

417
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,115
As a bonus, some of our more
troublesome students

418
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,950
might be scared straight.

419
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,619
Psst, kid.

420
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,830
Help me break out of here.

421
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,082
I'll totally make it
worth your while.

422
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,542
I'm listening.
