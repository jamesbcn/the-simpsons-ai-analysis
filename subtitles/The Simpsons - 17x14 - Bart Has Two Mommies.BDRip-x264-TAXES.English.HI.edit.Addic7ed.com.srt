(GASPING)

350
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,601
LISA: Maybe there's
another way to solve this.

351
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,968
Bart is clearly fulfilling an
emotional need for Toot-Tool.

352
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,247
Lisa, monkeys don't
have feelings.

353
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,762
If they did, then my experiments
could be called cruel.

354
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,605
Toot-Toot, look. I'm using
this rock as a tool.

355
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,091
(GRUNTING) Ow!

356
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,685
(DISTRESSED GIBBERING)

357
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,806
(GASPING)
She's kissing his boo-boo!

358
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,530
That's it! I'm going in!

359
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,171
(GIBBERING)

360
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,288
Excuse me,
Mrs. Toot.

361
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,768
I need to talk to you mother-to-mother.
(INQUISITIVE GIBBERING)

362
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,243
While you were living the
glamorous life of a TV chimp,

363
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,004
I was raising my son.

364
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,726
You have no right to take
him away from me now.

365
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,725
Please, please,
give me back my boy.

366
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,687
(GIBBERING)

367
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,045
(EXCITED GIBBERING)

368
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,447
Marge, Toot-Toot
and her son escaped!

369
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,726
(SIGHING)

370
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,684
The Hamburglar was survived by his
longtime companion, Mayor McCheese.

371
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,480
Now our latest update on
monkey boy Bart Simpson.

372
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,291
Toot-Toot has taken Bart to
the highest spot in town.

373
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,051
The new steeple atop the
First Church of Springfield.

374
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,246
(SOBBING)

375
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,562
Now, Marge, I know
things look bleak.

376
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,483
But it should
comfort you to know

377
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,689
we have this plaque
ready to go.

378
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,651
(MARGE GASPING)

379

(SOBBING)

380
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,361
Hey, I know how
we can save Bart!

381
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,000
HOMER: Mr. Teeny?

382
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,970
He also happens to
be Toot-Tom's son.

383
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,089
But Krusty said Mr. Teeny
was born in Funny Town.

384
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,561
Nelson, Funny Town
doesn't exist.

385
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,885
No! I was gonna live
at Cuckoo Corners!

386
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,241
Hmm.

387
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,451
Listen, we can trade
Mr. Teeny for Bart.

388
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,046
We just have to find
a way to get him up there.

389
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,929
I'm already doing it.

390
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,286
(SCREAMING)

391
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,567
Roddy, get down!
You're gonna fall!

392
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,926
(WHIMPERING)

393
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:54,091
Ned, Rod needs to know you believe
he can be okay on his own.

394
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,205
You'd be surprised what he could
do if you just gave him a chance.

395
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,201
Rod, you can do it, boy.

396
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,523
With God on your side,
you can't fail!

397
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,885
Toot-Toot, I have
something for you.

401
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,281
Yeah, great.
New I need a new sidekick.

402
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,085
Get me a lemur
or a marmot.

403
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,130
Or Tom Green. He's not
doing anything these days.

404
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,043
And really stick it
to him on the money.

405
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,605
Hurry,
let's climb down.

406
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,121
Okay. But don't let our hands touch.
It's gay.

407
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,328
What's gay mean?
Um...

408
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,402
It means you used to be
afraid, but now you're not.

409
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,927
I'm gay, Daddy!
I'm gay!

410
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,480
(YELLING) Mrs.
Simpson made me gay!

(HYPERVENTILATING)

412
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,242
I believe he's saying,
"He's okay."

413
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,168
My little boy
is growing up.

414
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,287
Hey, I'll say.

415
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,885
I haven't seen
climbing like that

416
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,531
since Dudley Moore
married Susan Anton.

417

(LAUGHING)

Oh, Bob, why did I wait 100
years to get you up here?

00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,041
You're telling me.

420
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,205
Now I can look down Dolly Parton's
dress whenever I want. (GROWLING)

Guys, I'm trying
to watch this.

Hey, I'm sorry.

423
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,091
What got into her?

424
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,686
Her kid's fruitier than
Carmen Miranda's hat rack.

425

Remember her?
