00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:07,968
(tires screech)

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,762
D'oh!

00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,764
-(screams)
-(tires screech)

5
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,874
{\an8}What a perfect outing
for a beautiful autumn day.

6
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,207
{\an8}I feel sorry for everyone
who's cooped up inside

7
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,883
{\an8}watching the seventh game
of the world series.

8
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:50,182
{\an8}(sarcastically) Yeah. They won't
learn anything about apples today.

9
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:54,098
{\an8}...and the cider mill operated
continuously until 1941

10
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,019
{\an8}when its workers left to
fight in the second world war.

11
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,348
{\an8}When they returned,

12
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,233
{\an8}the old girl was
just as they'd left her

13
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,060
{\an8}only now, she was infested

14
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,225
{\an8}with thousands
upon thousands of rats.

15
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,944
(disgusted murmuring)

16
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,185
{\an8}Right.

17
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,816
{\an8}And if you listen
real carefully,

18
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,613
{\an8}you can still hear them
gnawing away at the apples

19
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,696
{\an8}and splashing around
in the toilets.

20
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:17,122
{\an8}And that concludes
this portion of the tour.

21
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,002
(coins jingling)

22
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,119
{\an8}One of the most
historically significant

23
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,036
{\an8}fruit presses
in this part of the state.

24
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,535
{\an8}Based on a German design

25
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,127
{\an8}but modified
for larger American apples...

26
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,593
{\an8}Well, if god didn't make
little green apples

27
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,763
{\an8}it's Homer Simpson.

28
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,301
{\an8}How long
have you been here?

29
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:36,104
{\an8}20 of the suckiest minutes
of my life.

30
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,259
{\an8}Oh, sucking down
the cider, huh?

31
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,978
{\an8}Hey, word to the wise--
Season pass.

32
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,849
Pays for itself
after the 16th visit.

33
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,896
You know, most people
don't know the difference

34
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,729
between apple cider
and apple juice, but I do.

35
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,436
Here's a little trick
to help you remember.

36
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,316
If it's clear and yella,
you've got juice there, fella.

37
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,573
If it's tangy and brown,
you're in cider town.

38
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,906
Now, there's two exceptions,
and it gets tricky here...

39
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,871
<i>HOMER'S BRAIN: Ohh!</i>
<i>You can stay, but I'm leaving.</i>

40
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,793
...can be yellow if they're
using late season apples.

41
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,582
And, of course, in Canada,
the whole thing's flip-flopped.

42
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,957
Oh my, I better get you
some cider.

43
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,340
Next to spring and winter

44
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,933
fall is my absolute
favorite season.

45
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,299
Just look at all
this beautiful "foilage".

46
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,388
It's not "foilage," Mom.
It's "foliage."

47
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,774
Foliage.

48
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,981
That's what I said, "foilage".

49
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,521
It doesn't take

50
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:29,734
a "nucular" scientist
to pronounce "foilage".

51
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,436
(exasperated sigh)

52
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,368
Honestly, Smithers

53
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,831
I don't know why Harvard
even bothers to show up.

54
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,252
They barely even won.

55
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,921
Their cheating was
even more rampant

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,960
than last year, sir.

57
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,592
Well, I say let Harvard have
its football and academics.

58
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:01,137
Yale will always be first
in gentlemanly club life.

59
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,432
Why, every friend I have,
I made right here.

60
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,226
Hello, Burnsie.

61
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,390
It's your old roomie, Dink.

62
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,347
(groans)

63
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,362
Steady... Steady...

64
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,606
(screeching)

65
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,664
Oh-ho!
Nicely played, sir.

66
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,372
MAN (on PA):
<i>Attention, passengers.</i>

67
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,202
<i>The train has been</i>
<i>temporarily delayed</i>

68
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,537
<i>because of a discarded couch</i>
<i>on the tracks.</i>

69
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,590
Looks like
some sort of a couch.

70
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,759
This might
take a while, Smithers.

71
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,418
Why don't you get drunk
and stumble around

72
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,586
comically
for my amusement?

73
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,054
I'll be a one-man conga line.

74
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,892
Customers. Thank God.

75
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,345
Papa needs
a new pair of everything.

76
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,896
Hey, how you doing?

77
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,519
Welcome to scenic Waynesport

78
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,686
and remember your visit
with a googly-eyed walnut.

79
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,396
How about a googly-eyed rock?

80
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,396
Some nice local squash candy?

81
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,948
A stretched-out Pepsi bottle?

82
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,241
Come on.

83
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,414
If this stuff
is too nice for you,

84
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,082
I've got some crap.

85
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,370
(humming drunkenly)

86
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,385
Hey, Casey Jones,

87
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,385
where's this train headed?

88
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,636
Springfield.

89
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,267
Yeah, yeah.
What state?

90
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,274
(train whistle blows)

91
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,485
I can honestly say

92
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,529
that was the most fun
I've ever had.

93
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:45,333
The mill, the history,
all that gorgeous... foliage.

94
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,250
I can't "excape" Lisa,
our little walking "libary".

95
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,498
Can't they get a pole
for that sign?

96
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,746
That's a hitchhiker,
Homer.

97
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,958
Ooh!
Let's pick him up.

98
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,757
No!
What if he's crazy?

99
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,011
And what if he's not?
Then we'd look like idiots.

100
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,593
We're not picking him up.

101
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,638
-Oh, yes, we are.
-There's not enough room.

102
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,181
Yes, there is.

103
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,974
I just don't think
it's a good idea.

104
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,477
And I think it's
the best idea I've ever had.

105
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,900
We're picking up the weirdo,
and that's final.

106
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,451
Hey, you folks are
all right.

107
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,370
Man, it was rough
getting a ride out there.

108
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,159
The only car
that stopped was a hearse

109
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,332
that thought I fell out.

110
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,830
It was rough, I tell you.

111
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,496
Careful of the apple pie
on the seat.

112
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,712
Uh-oh!

113
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,131
Grandpa, are you sitting
on the pie?

114
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,670
I sure hope so.

115
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,510
I'm looking for this guy.
Anybody know who he is?

116
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,392
Yeah, sure, we know him.
That's Mr. Burns.

117
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,679
He tried to kill our puppies.

118
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,352
He sexually harassed me.

119
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,350
He stole my fiancee.

120
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,932
He made fun of my weight.

121
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,728
Okay, so there's been
a little friction.

122
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:54,691
Know his address?

123
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,322
Ho, this guy's got more bread
than a prison meat loaf.

124
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,703
He's rich, I tell you.

125
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,820
I never seen a place
with a walk-in mailbox.

126
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,328
Hey, who am I talking to?

127
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,332
(doorbell rings)

128
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,208
Yes?

129
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,211
Yeah. Uh...
Hi. My name is Larry.

130
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,844
I'm here to see Mr. Burns.

131
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,551
Well, I hate
to break it to you, Larry

132
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,761
but if Mr. Burns
ever wants to see a stranger

133
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,141
he will observe him
through a powerful telescope.

134
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,599
-Now--
-Smithers, what's going on?

135
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,809
How dare you interrupt
my lime rickey!

136
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,350
(loud slurping)

137
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,734
State your business.

138
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,441
Well, uh... Sheesh, uh...

139
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,111
I'm a little nervous here.

140
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,439
What I'm trying to say
is I'm--

141
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,364
You're what?
Selling light bulbs?

142
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,572
Worried about the whales?

143
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,322
Keen on Jesus?
Out with it.

144
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,864
Well, Mr. Burns, I'm your son.

145
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,491
Oh, and I stepped on
one of your peacocks.

146
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,946
You got a paper towel?

147
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,706
It's true.

148
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,042
He is my son.

149
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,797
Hey, now you're talking.

150
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,418
Good God.

151
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,255
Pop, don't get me wrong,
it's great to be here.

152
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,381
But how does a guy
like you wind up

153
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,887
with a son like me?

154
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,389
Larry, my lad,
I've gone over this story

155
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,721
in my mind a million times.

156
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,677
It was 1941.

157
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,477
The-- No, '39.

158
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,232
My 25th Yale reunion.

159
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,149
<i>Who should appear</i>
<i>but the unrequited love</i>

160
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,866
<i>of my college years,</i>
<i>Mimsie Bancroft.</i>

161
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,528
<i>Of course, by then, Mimsie</i>
<i>had her share of wrinkles</i>

162
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,157
<i>and a gray hair or two</i>
<i>but my adoring eyes</i>

163
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,155
<i>saw past those</i>
<i>minor imperfections</i>

164
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,457
<i>to her 21-year-old</i>
<i>daughter, lily.</i>

165
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,001
<i>I took Lily</i>
<i>to the local cinematorium</i>

166
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,875
<i>where our passions</i>
<i>were inflamed</i>

167
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,012
<i>by Clark Gable's reckless</i>
<i>use of the word "Damn".</i>

168
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,970
{\an8}<i>We sneaked into</i>
<i>the nearby Peabody Museum.</i>

169
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:52,721
<i>There, under the smiling eyes</i>
<i>of four stuffed eskimos</i>

170
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,345
<i>we expressed</i>
<i>our love physically</i>

171
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,773
<i>as was the style</i>
<i>at the time.</i>

172
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,395
How do you like that?
I have been in a museum.

173
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,783
So, what happened
with you and ma?

174
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,939
There was
a terrible scandal.

175
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,448
Lily's family forced her
to give you up

176
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:12,119
and bundled her off to
a convent in the south seas.

177
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,870
I never heard
from her again.

178
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,161
But I prattle on.

179
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,664
Tell me everything
about your life.

180
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,156
Oh, what's to tell?

181
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,207
I was at the orphanage
till I was 18.

182
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,341
Then I got my job
at a souvenir stand.

183
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,379
Oh, and once,
I saw a blimp.

184
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,053
Well, you must be tired.

185
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,222
Let me
show you your room.

186
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,063
Oh, is this posh!

187
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:37,558
Pop, nobody's
ever been so nice to me.

188
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,692
Yes, yes.

189
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,809
All right.
(chuckles)

190
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,936
Good to see you too.

191
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,073
Now then,
in case you get bored,

192
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,440
here's the playroom.

193
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,818
You can't just eat the orange
and throw the peel away!

194
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,616
A man's not a piece of fruit!

195
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,659
This show was supposed
to close last week!

196
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:59,293
Close this show!
Close it, I say.

197
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,672
Hey, don't worry about it.

198
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,708
You're all right.

199
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,256
-(shrieks)
-Huh?

200
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,930
Hey, you're
that hitchhiker.

201
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,128
What are you doing here?

202
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,718
Learning
the family business.

203
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,643
I'm Larry Burns,
the boss' son.

204
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,761
Uh-oh!

205
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,523
Yeah, relax.
I don't want to work.

206
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,481
I'm so lazy, I took
lessons on a player piano.

207
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,273
Wow, that's really lazy.

208
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,016
Lazy?
You're not kidding.

209
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,188
I'm like a rug on valium.
I'm talkin' lazy.

210
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,607
So lazy.

211
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,276
And Larry and I have
so much in common, Marge,

212
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,735
way more than
you and me.

213
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,785
If I could be stranded
on an island with anyone

214
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,749
it would definitely be Larry.

215
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,120
I think
we've heard enough

216
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,286
about Larry Burns
for one evening.

217
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,205
Why? It's not like
anything interesting happened

218
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,884
to anyone else today.

219
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,137
Hey, Pop, this crowd
is pretty swanky.

220
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,601
I'm not gonna fit in here.

221
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,351
Nonsense, Larry.

222
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,353
Your blood is bluer
than any of theirs.

223
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,185
Just give them a snootful
of the old Burns charm.

224
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,231
Oh, Admiral Carstairs.

225
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,565
I'd like you to meet
my son, Larry.

226
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,069
Hey, skipper,
good to meet you.

227
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,241
Where'd you start out,
on the Merrimack?

228
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,650
Hey, I should talk.

229
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,778
I hope I look that
good when I'm 200.

230
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,405
Such insubordination!

231
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,161
Larry, please.

232
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,753
He's very sensitive
about his age.

233
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,078
Oh, Monty,
this must be the son

234
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,674
I've heard
so much about.

235
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:28,249
Larry, you must meet
our daughter, the debutante.

236
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,086
She came out last spring.

237
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,011
Whoa! Put her back in.

238
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,049
She's not done yet.

239
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,053
Hmph!

240
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,178
Smithers, there's something
a bit odd about young Larry.

241
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,894
I can't quite put
my finger on it.

242
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,435
Well, he is a bit rough
around the edges, sir.

243
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,859
One might blame his truly
heroic intake of cocktails.

244
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,899
Pull up a seat, Pop.
You, too, Chuckles.

245
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,113
I mean,
the food ain't great

246
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,653
but the portions
are terrific.

247
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,487
Hey, I'm kidding. Relax.

248
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,572
Hey, give my regards
to Mrs. Boy-ar-dee.

249
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,028
(groans)

250
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,657
A total lack of refinement.

251
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,374
Smithers, send for the boys
at Yale admissions, hmm?

252
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,671
Well, did you meet Larry?

253
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,001
Oh, yes.

254
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,086
He made light
of my weight problem.

255
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,511
Then suggested my motto
should be "Semper fudge."

256
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,141
At that point,
he told me to "Relax."

257
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,719
How were his test scores?

258
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,014
Let's just say this--

259
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,307
He spelled "Yale"
with a six.

260
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,391
I see. Well, I--

261
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,016
Oh, you know,
I just remembered

262
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,773
it's time
for my annual donation.

263
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,824
I wonder
how much I should give.

264
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,858
Well, frankly,
test scores like Larry's

265
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,702
would call for a
very generous contribution.

266
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,658
For example, a score of 400

267
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,278
would require a donation
of new football uniforms

268
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,446
300, a new dormitory,
and in Larry's case

269
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,116
we would need
an international airport.

270
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,754
Yale could use an international airport,
Mr. Burns.

271
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,043
Are you mad?

272
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,336
I'm not made of airports!

273
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,049
Get out!

274
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,459
Summon my son at once.

275
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,840
Uh...

276
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,885
It appears
he's gone drinkin', sir.

277
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,719
(growls)

278
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,934
Everybody go nuts!
I'm buying!

279
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,135
Hey, handsome,
send the bill to my dad.

280
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,306
Okay, but the last guy
who charged a drink to Burns

281
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,306
turned up in a landfill.

282
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,107
Yeah, but it was worth it.

283
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,230
(belches)

284
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,396
What's everybody
in this burg

285
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,784
have against my dad?

286
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,241
He's a pussycat.

287
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,110
I tell you,
he's a doll-baby.

288
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,617
Come on over,
I'll show you.

289
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,952
(loud chewing)

290
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,417
Oh, this is some party.

291
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,920
If it gets any livelier,

292
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,302
a funeral's
going to break out.

293
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,798
Quiet, you.

294
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,010
Nobody likes a comedian.

295
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,419
Geez. Come on, Dad.

296
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,507
We got company.

297
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,302
Make with the yakkety-yak-yak.

298
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,965
(quietly):
Oh... "Yakkety-yak-yak."

299
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,104
You, foodbag.

300
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,271
Do you have a son?

301
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,481
Yes, sir, I do.

302
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,229
And is he a constant
disappointment?

303
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,651
Does he bring home nitwits
and make you talk to them?

304
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,150
Oh, all the time!

305
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,901
Have you ever heard
of this kid Milhouse?

306
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,323
He's a little wiener--

307
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,571
Fascinating.
Good night.

308
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,822
Dad, what's
with you tonight?

309
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,985
I mean, I'm getting
frostbite over here.

310
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,283
I'll tell you
what's with me.

311
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,787
The humiliation of having

312
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,829
a coarse, boorish
ignoramus for a son!

313
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:15,455
(quietly):
Uh, I should go.

314
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,924
What's the matter, Pop?

315
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,344
Don't you love me anymore?

316
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,592
(door slams)

317
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,769
Sheesh, Dad and I,
we started out great

318
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,518
but now it's falling apart
like a Chinese motorcycle.

319
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,851
It's so unfair.

320
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,556
You're everything
a dad could hope for.

321
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,856
Yeah, I tell you,
I don't get no regard.

322
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,070
No regard at all.

323
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,569
No esteem, either.

324
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,611
Larry, there's
only one sure way

325
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,494
to make him realize
how much he loves you.

326
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,071
And that...

327
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,156
is a phony kidnapping.

328
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,952
Yeah, right.
I don't know.

329
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,195
Maybe I should
just leave town.

330
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,407
(sing-song)
Phony kidnapping.

331
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,578
Nah.

332
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,626
I know what I got to do.

333
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,089
I got to clean up my act.

334
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,839
No more joking around
all the time.

335
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,461
No more slacking off at work.

336
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:04,588
And most important:
no more booze.

337
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,927
I know I can do it.

338
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,807
"Your son has been kidnapped."

339
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,361
I can't believe someone
would kidnap my Larry.

340
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,361
I won't rest until
he's returned to me.

341
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,903
Not to be impertinent, sir,
but didn't you want Larry

342
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,368
out of your life as recently
as two hours ago?

343
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,828
It's the principle, Smithers.

344
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,828
Nobody steals
from Montgomery Burns

345
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,830
whether it be
my Sunday newspaper

346
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,162
or my loutish oaf
of a son.

347
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,537
All right, Mr. B.,

348
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,963
when the kidnappers call
with the ransom demand

349
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,842
you tell them
you'll leave the money

350
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,709
under the big net in the park.

351
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,836
And then down comes
the net, right, chief?

352
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,934
Hey, I like it.

353
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,010
I like it a lot.

354
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,637
Hmm?

355
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,686
What are you doing
in the basement?

356
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,606
It's like you're hiding out
down here.

357
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,355
Hiding out?

358
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,987
Marge, you've been reading
too many hideout books.

359
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,124
What's that hitchhiker
doing here?

360
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,411
Is every drifter we meet
going to move in with us?

361
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,955
Of course not.

362
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,999
We'll decide that on
a drifter-by-drifter basis.

363
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,042
He's not a drifter, Mom.
That's Mr. Burns's son, Larry.

364
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,997
He's great at pointing out
everyone's foibles.

365
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,087
Hey! How are you doing?

366
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,722
Hoo, look at your hair.

367
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,758
What happened?
You saw yourself in the mirror?

368
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,262
He's kidding, Mom.

369
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,394
But seriously, I'd love
to have hair like yours.

370
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,011
I just can't get
the zoning permits.

371
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,137
Hey, that reminds me, Mom--
Buckingham palace called.

372
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,595
They want their hat back.

373
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,845
(grumbles)

374
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,807
Hey, kids, how about
a hand for your mom?

375
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,977
She's all right.

376
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,855
-Yeah, Mom!
-All right, Mom!

377
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,652
Oh. Yeah. Thank you.

378
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,118
(phone ringing)

379
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,449
Ahoy-hoy?

380
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,043
(voice buzzing)
Hello, Mr. Burns.

381
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,118
This is the kidnapper.

382
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,834
Do you miss your son?

383
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,254
Yes, I'm missing
one son.

384
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,582
Return it immediately.

385
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,037
If you really
love Larry, prove it,

386
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,417
and you can
have him back today.

387
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,915
Oh, how much proof
do you need?

388
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,257
5,000? 6,000?

389
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,012
I swear,
that's all I've got.

390
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,434
Don't you care
about your son?

391
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,433
This is more important
than money.

392
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,425
More important
than money?

393
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,926
Who is this?

394
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:20,267
Uh... just a second.

395
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,022
Beautiful. Eddie, did you
trace the phone number?

396
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,358
Sure did, chief.

397
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:29,412
555... Aw, geez,
that's got to be phony.

398
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,539
Hey, I think I got a pai gow.

399
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,449
I hate pai gow.

400
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,708
Can't we just play quang jong?

401
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,829
Can't we just
go upstairs?

402
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,415
Homer: No!

403
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,460
{\an8}<i>This is Kent Brockman</i>
<i>in Choppercopter 6</i>

404
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,214
{\an8}<i>with a special report.</i>

405
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,375
{\an8}<i>Montgomery Burns's son</i>
<i>has been kidnapped.</i>

406
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,755
Kidnapped?

407
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,052
Marge, it's not
a real kidnapping.

408
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,966
It's a simple hoax
to win a father's love.

409
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,845
You know how I feel
about hoaxes.

410
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,022
Still?

411
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,140
I want you to take
Larry back

412
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,476
to Mr. Burns right now

413
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,191
before you get in
a lot of trouble.

414
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,561
What!?

415
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,357
But, Marge, it's
broad daylight

416
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,901
and there's
cops everywhere.

417
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,494
No excuses.
Just do it.

418
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,149
Oh!

419
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,913
<i>Of course</i>
<i>we'll bring you updates</i>

420
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,373
{\an8}<i>just as soon as they--</i>

421
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,873
{\an8}<i>Oh, wait a minute!</i>
<i>There they are!</i>

422
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,294
{\an8}<i>Larry Burns and his kidnapper.</i>

423
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,463
{\an8}<i>(screams)</i>

424
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,128
{\an8}<i>Appearing in broad daylight</i>
<i>with police everywhere--</i>

425
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,973
{\an8}<i>Ladies and gentlemen, there's</i>
<i>only one word for that:</i>

426
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,050
{\an8}<i>Idiocy.</i>

427
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,184
(groans)

428
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,431
(sirens wailing)

429
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,690
(panting)

430
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,810
We've got to find
someplace to hide.

431
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,107
The abandoned warehouse.

432
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,855
D'oh!

433
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,284
Stupid economic recovery.

434
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,876
Hey, buy a costume
or get out, fellas.

435
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,090
We've got to find someplace
no one will ever go.

436
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,223
Hello!

437
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,639
CHILD:
<i>Drive faster, Grandma!</i>

438
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,060
<i>Grandma's gaining on us!</i>

439
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,559
(chuckles) They'll never look
for us here.

440
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,352
This place is emptier
than a Scottish pay toilet.

441
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,646
Shh!

442
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:29,319
Some people are trying
to watch the movie.

443
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,149
You don't like it,
call the cops.

444
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,855
(laughing)

445
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,486
(both laughing)

446
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,035
(sirens wailing)

447
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,581
This is Kent Brockman,
live from the Aztec theater

448
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,245
where police have learned

449
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,583
that kidnapper Homer Simpson
and hostage Larry Burns

450
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,548
<i>are inside talking loudly.</i>

451
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,669
Oh, give yourself up, Homie!

452
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,336
No, Dad!
Shoot your way out!

453
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,854
(gunfire)

454
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,218
(screaming)

455
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,885
<i>A bloody end</i>
<i>for Homer Simpson...</i>

456
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,685
<i>is just one of several</i>
<i>possible outcomes</i>

457
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,648
<i>according to our</i>
<i>computer simulation.</i>

458
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,728
<i>Now here's how it would look</i>
<i>if the police killed him</i>

459
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,984
<i>with a barrage of baseballs.</i>

460
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,106
We've got to go
down there and help dad.

461
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,203
HOMER: <i>Ouch! Oooch!</i>
<i>Eeech! Ouch! Oooch!</i>

462
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,659
<i>Oh, stop it!</i>

463
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,277
Shh.

464
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,239
(sticky footsteps)

465
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,583
(crunching)
Still warm.

466
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,707
-They can't be far.
-(door opens)

467
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:30,673
Chief!

468
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,723
(sticky sounds)

469
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,847
(grunts)

470
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,678
WIGGUM:
Don't be a fool, Simpson.

471
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,183
Let the kid go.

472
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,555
The negotiations have failed.
Shoot him!

473
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,772
(hammer cocking)

474
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,148
Wait!

475
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,309
(all gasping)

476
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,607
WOMAN: Wait? What do
you mean, wait?

477
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,980
I mean,
Homer's no kidnapper.

478
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,276
He's the best friend
I ever had.

479
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,490
We faked the whole thing.

480
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,070
(shocked murmuring)

481
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,616
I should have known
you're the only one

482
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,949
stupid enough
to kidnap you.

483
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,994
Now get down here
so I can spank you

484
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,157
in front of this
gawking rabble.

485
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,615
Smithers, take off
my belt.

486
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,786
With pleasure, sir.

487
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,544
Hold on, Mr. Burns.

488
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,706
Maybe we did fake
a kidnapping

489
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,424
but is that really
such a crime?

490
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,625
All your son wanted
was a little attention,

491
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,426
a little love.

492
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,469
I'm a father myself, sir.

493
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,183
And sure,
sometimes my kids

494
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:27,183
can be obnoxious...
or boring... or stinky

495
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,727
but they can always count
on one thing:

496
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,441
their father's
unconditional love.

497
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,202
Well, how about it, Pop?

498
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,738
I know it's tough

499
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,781
but can you love me
for what I am?

500
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:42,985
Uh...

501
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,289
Well...

502
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,870
Uh...

503
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,825
There, there, sonny boy.

504
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,706
I suppose I have been
a bit--

505
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,214
Oh, no, I can't do it.

506
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,705
It's just not me.

507
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,087
I'm sorry, Larry

508
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,644
I can't be the family
that you need.

509
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,758
Aw, that's okay.
I got a wife and kids.

510
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,306
Oh, that reminds me.

511
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,930
They're probably wondering
where I went.

512
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,476
I told them I'm going
for coffee.

513
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,729
That was a week ago.

514
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,611
Well, Son, delighted
to have met you.

515
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,069
It's good to know

516
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,818
that there's another
kidney out there for me.

517
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,441
You got it, Pop.

518
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,858
Just let me run a few
pints through it first.

519
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,907
As long as everybody's here...

520
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,491
Let's party!

521
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,995
(all cheering)

522
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:31,368
<i>♪ Any way you want it,</i>
<i>that's the way you need it ♪</i>

523
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,456
<i>♪ Any way you want it ♪</i>

524
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,420
Who's playing
