1
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:07,508
<i>Day-oh!</i>

2
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,743
<i>Day-oh!</i>

3
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:12,579
D'oh!

4
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:13,847
D'oh!

5
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,990
Come on, out of my way!

6
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,158
Where was this traffic
when I was driving to church?

7
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,261
Homie, calm down.

8
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:30,264
We're not going to miss
the San Castellaneta Festival.

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,499
I love San Castellaneta.

10
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,935
Delicious food,
wonderful people.

11
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,770
It's just like being in Italy.

12
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:39,907
But with streets that are
wide enough I can fit in them.

13
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:42,776
And I love the rides
that are dangerous

14
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:44,511
because they're 100 years old.

15
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,721
Hold on, kids. Here we go.

16
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,825
I beat out a mule
and an ox for this job.

17
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,295
The secret is
not to ask for benefits.

18
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,665
<i>Give me pizza,
give me pasta</i>

19
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,067
<i>Give me lots of cannoli</i>

20
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,136
<i>I'll drink sambuca
till I puke-a</i>

21
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,939
<i>Then I'll finish
with spumoni</i>

22
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,574
<i>Drink until my legs
are Jell-O</i>

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,677
<i>Cheap red wine
and limoncello...</i>

24
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,690
You want us to bring you
anything back

25
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,791
from the festival, Tone?

26
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,626
No. It's all carbs.

27
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,528
I don't want people
to think I'm fat.

28
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,630
But your name is Fat Tony.

29
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,131
It blends.

30
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,866
I can't believe
you're not going,

31
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,469
after I flew out
your uncle from Sicily.

32
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,172
- Idiota!
- That icy glare

33
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,174
is why I left the old country.

34
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,911
Tightlips, you do a poor job
of reading my moods.

35
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,081
But you're the only one I trust.

36
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,049
Go. Enjoy your festival

37
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,953
while I sit here
bonding with my uncle.

38
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,055
Do you want to go
to the festival, zio?

39
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,627
I came to this country
for the Burning Man.

40
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,362
Before I die,

41
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:13,667
I want to see a naked
crunchy chick riding a bicycle.

42
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,369
<i>Everybody has a treat...</i>

43
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:23,176
- Opa!
- That's Greek, Chief.

44
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,812
Hey, Lou, when's the festival
for Saint Know-It-All?

45
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,181
- I believe it's October the...
- There isn't one!

46
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,684
Nobody likes a know-it-all.
Idiot.

47
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,053
Hey, we got a-zeppole,
we got a-braciole,

48
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,188
capicola, scungilli,

49
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,190
and I don't know
what the hell-a this is.

50
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,459
Can you make it all
in one thing and fry it?

51
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,795
I saw-a you coming.

52
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,866
This place
looks interesting.

53
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,935
Dad, no,
that's an actual church.

54
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,406
Welcome, everyone,
to this festival

55
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,542
that does not celebrate
Christopher Columbus.

56
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,577
Repeat, not Columbus.

57
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,579
As we stand here at the corner

58
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,683
of NiÃ±a and Pinta
and Santa Maria,

59
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:06,086
let us welcome
your master of cere-spumonies,

60
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:07,854
Aquaman himself,

61
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,457
Jason Morororora.

62
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,227
It is an honor
to be here on land today

63
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:17,731
to recount the inspiring story
of this great saint.

64
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,767
- Aquaman.
- Sign my left boob.

65
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,103
Aquaman is not here
for the signing of boobs.

66
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,307
That's a separate event at
the Marriott. Conference room C.

67
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,580
In 250 A. D.,
Brother Ignatius Castellaneta

68
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,016
refused to recant
his Christian faith.

69
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,851
And so the Romans
chopped off his head,

70
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:39,319
they chopped off his arms,

71
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,522
they chopped off his legs,
and they chopped off his toes.

72
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,958
They shot him with arrows
made of frozen snakes

73
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,927
and they pulled out his eyes
and replaced them

74
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,929
with chocolate-covered
pistachios.

75
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,598
But still,
Ignatius refused to recant.

76
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:54,501
So they boiled his bones
in sparkling cherry wine.

77
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,704
So that's why
the thrice-martyred saint

78
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,339
is remembered with spumoni,

79
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,109
the chocolate pistachio
cherry ice cream treat.

80
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,947
Not good.

81
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,149
Yes, thank you, Super-Fish.

82
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:12,652
And now, let us show
our deep reverence for Jesus

83
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,956
by festooning his statue
with dollar bills.

84
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,961
Pin a dollar on Jesus, Homer.

85
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,596
He doesn't need money.

86
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,465
I hear his father's loaded.

87
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,270
Hey, where's my wallet?

88
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,938
Yeah, my wallet's gone too.

89
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,840
- My purse!
- My belt!

90
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,308
My clutch!

91
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,311
We are the victims
of a pocket-picking pandemic.

92
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,614
Do something, Wet Panther!

93
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,824
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pocket wallets?

94
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:53,527
How many paupers did
Peter's pocket picking produce?

95
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:56,530
I'm afraid no pants are
safe from this Dockers stalker,

96
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,366
this chino bandito,
this trouser browser.

97
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:03,537
But Chief Wiggum vows he will
solve this pickle of a puzzle.

98
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,472
Oh, I solved it, all right.

99
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,674
Thief of polite.
Thief of polite.

100
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,142
I said it first!

101
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:13,446
Wiggum, I hate to interrupt
this important police work...

102
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,516
Police. That's it.
Thief of police.

103
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,653
Hey! I need that to switch
to Access Hollywood.

104
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,822
You need a lot more than that.

105
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,824
I'm Lenora Carter,
special investigator

106
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,826
from the attorney general's
office,

107
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,061
and I'm taking over this case.

108
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,063
Look, ma'am,
you seem nice, but no one

109
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,866
comes into my precinct
and tells me what to do.

110
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,901
- Shut up and listen.
- Yes, ma'am.

111
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,838
You are the worst police officer
I've ever had the pleasure

112
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,906
of humiliating
in front of his men.

113
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:43,243
You are so fat,
you're good cop and bad cop.

114
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,912
Your drug-sniffing dog
is in rehab.

115
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,581
Okay, it's for sex addiction.

116
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,218
You there,
Riggs and Murtaugh.

117
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,921
It's time to do
some real police work.

118
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,656
I see, fine. No, go ahead.

119
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,659
I'll go work out my feelings
on the gun range.

120
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,596
We don't have a gun range!

121
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:09,603
We'll trap the pickpocket by
planting a wallet with a tracer

122
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:13,573
in a rear end so huge,
no criminal could miss it.

123
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,376
- We need to find the biggest ass in town.
- Hello.

124
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:20,780
Could you direct me to the
Office of Park Bench Removal?

125
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,315
Yeah, just take a seat, sir.

126
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,317
Thank you, I have my own.

127
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,956
I'm not letting
my husband risk his life.

128
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,791
I admit it, I'm scared.

129
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,995
Ma'am, this is a matter
of public urgency.

130
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,331
Your husband's rear end
is bigger than the both of us.

131
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,236
With your kids' permission,
we can watch

132
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:46,473
your father's butt
crack this case wide open.

133
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,912
Wide open.

134
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,816
Homer, we're placing this
tracking device in your wallet.

135
00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:00,453
Then you just have to put that
sweet seat meat on the street.

136
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,122
Now let me pull your wallet up

137
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,924
so it's just peeking
over the pocket.

138
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,659
Allow me.

139
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,494
Pick a card. Any card.

140
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,130
Thank God that thing
is on our side.

141
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,299
<i>I don't think
you're ready for this</i>

142
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,467
<i>'Cause my body's too
bootylicious for you, babe...</i>

143
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,072
<i>I don't think you're ready
for this jelly</i>

144
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,107
<i>I don't think
you're ready for this</i>

145
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,643
<i>'Cause my body's too
bootylicious for you, babe</i>

146
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,279
<i>Baby, can you handle this?</i>

147
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,682
<i>Baby, can you handle this?</i>

148
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,223
We've got our target.

149
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,663
What are you doing here?

150
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,165
I admit it,

151
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,200
I couldn't stay away.
I was following you.

152
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,869
Also, I was driving around
to put Ralphie to sleep.

153
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,871
That kid will not go down.

154
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:55,208
I'm a lotto ball.
You lose again, Daddy.

155
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,543
We're going in.

156
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:59,212
Except you.

157
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,455
You work with two guys
all your life

158
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,056
and you think you know 'em.

159
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:13,693
Betrayed by Lou
and the other guy.

160
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,128
What is his name again?

161
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,297
I want to say Greg.

162
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:24,971
You know, Uncle, guests, like
fish, stink after three days.

163
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,308
I told you once,
I told you a thousand times,

164
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,044
I'm not leaving
until my wife forgives me.

165
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:34,414
- She's dead.
- You always take her side!

166
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,883
Cops?
What are you doing here?

167
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,519
This is a setup.
What are these things?

168
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:42,722
I was told this was an
Asian fusion pop-up restaurant,

169
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,358
but I see no Asian nor fusion.

170
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,360
Marion "Fat Tony" D'Amico,

171
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:50,296
you're under arrest
for heading a pickpocket ring.

172
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,932
But I've never seen
these wallets before.

173
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,634
The room is spinning.

174
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,571
So this is what it feels like
to be innocent.

175
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:02,242
And this is how it feels
to be irrelevant.

176
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,010
Daddy's an elephant.

177
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,446
No, I'm not
an elephant, Ralphie,

178
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,782
and please
don't you forget it.

179
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:29,602
The Wolf of Wallet Street?

180
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:33,606
Reputed mobster Fat Tony D'Amico
is at last behind bars.

181
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:37,510
My wife.

182
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,080
My goomar.

183
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,084
My teacup pig.

184
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,624
What's wrong, Chief?

185
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,127
Marge, you ever felt like
life has passed you by,

186
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,762
there's no point?

187
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,697
Oh, you're just having
a rough patch.

188
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,166
It happens to all men
in their 50s.

189
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,768
I'm 38, Marge.

190
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,605
Chief, do you know
why I love my husband?

191
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,808
For that most romantic
of reasons, inertia.

192
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,878
I love him because
he's not afraid to fail.

193
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:16,349
He has boundless unjustified
confidence, and you should too.

194
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,184
Really? You think so?

195
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:21,020
Boy, suddenly,
I see a break in the clouds.

196
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,256
I will not let you down, Marge.

197
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,395
Marge, can I get
a ride to the station?

198
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,364
Ralphie will stay
with the car.

199
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,174
Dear Lord, who sees all,
the jabronis and the mamalukes,

200
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,009
you know I am innocent.

201
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,378
In your mercy and by your grace,

202
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:48,982
help me kneecap
the rat Judas who set me up.

203
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,550
Amen.

204
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,890
Almighty God,
I'm not a praying man.

205
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,260
For me, getting down on my knees
is often a one-way trip.

206
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,163
I know I made a deal
with the devil to be chief,

207
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:06,566
but please just ignore that
and help me out, will ya?

208
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,574
Dear Lord, please bring back
plastic straws.

209
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:17,777
The paper ones
get soggy so fast.

210
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,213
I brought the mob lawyer
right away

211
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,447
like you asked, boss.

212
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,550
They wouldn't even let me
put my pants on.

213
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,385
I was barely able
to grab my rate clock.

214
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,887
Al diavolo rate clock.
Get me out of here.

215
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,490
- And I mean fast.
- Patience. Patience.

216
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:33,159
Okay, what have they got you on?

217
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:36,329
Murder one?

218
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:39,165
Murder two?

219
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,668
Pickpocketing!
Quit talking slow!

220
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,836
All right.

221
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,939
Actually, I'm innocent.

222
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,174
Innocent?! Innocent?!

223
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,977
A judge wouldn't believe you
for a second.

224
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,546
I've got nothing
to work with here.

225
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:56,950
What would you even plead?
You really did it this time.

226
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,118
I didn't do it.

227
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,456
- You want me to whack him, boss?
- No! Just usher him out.

228
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,292
Got it. I'll usher him out.

229
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,228
I mean show him the door.

230
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,964
Right.
I'll show him the door.

231
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,666
Whatever you think I want you
to do, just do the opposite!

232
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:41,861
The one crime I would
never commit is pickpocketing.

233
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,397
He seems sincere.

234
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,199
I am sincere.

235
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,802
When I was a boy,
my father, Fatso Antonio,

236
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,738
needed a heart transplant.

237
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:55,575
On its way to the hospital,
that heart was pickpocketed.

238
00:12:55,642 --> 00:13:00,113
My father died
the way no made man should die:

239
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,615
of natural causes.

240
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,053
Oh, my God.
I discovered a clue.

241
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,822
I found an electric toothbrush.

242
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,193
Well, he'll sleep good tonight.

243
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,962
I can tell he's innocent,

244
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,997
with a certainty
you can only develop

245
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:21,334
putting hundreds
of innocent people in jail.

246
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:25,538
DNA technology
has not been my friend.

247
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:27,840
Lights out!

248
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:32,612
Why do you "psst" me?
I'm not going anywhere.

249
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,846
I think you're innocent.

250
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,715
But you're gonna
have to convince me

251
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:38,618
to ignore
your entire past history.

252
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,857
I was not born a rich man.

253
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:48,461
Where I grew up, there was
one way out, your fists.

254
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,697
Or the many scholarships
available

255
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,899
to young Italian-American
students.

256
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,068
But the forms
required information,

257
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,070
and I ain't no snitch.

258
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,371
All right,
I'm losing my confidence.

259
00:13:58,438 --> 00:13:59,806
You did it, didn't you?

260
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:03,509
I swear on this former priest
that I didn't do it.

261
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,545
He's not guilty.

262
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,448
- And I know guilty.
- And I can prove it.

263
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,384
- Well, go ahead.
- I said I can prove it.

264
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,519
I didn't say I would.

265
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,355
Well, why wouldn't you?

266
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:18,558
Because what I was actually
doing at the time is something

267
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:22,195
a mob boss cannot do
and let people know.

268
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,963
If you help me, I swear an oath

269
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,132
we'll find the guy
that framed you.

270
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,301
All right, I will show you
what I was doing

271
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,936
when the heist went down.

272
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:34,040
It's so embarrassing,
it has to be true.

273
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,775
Give me your phone.

274
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:42,315
This is what I do
every day at that time,

275
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,916
the time of the crime.

276
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:47,987
As you will see,
I walk into my private space,

277
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,323
I gargle,

278
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,660
and then, God help me,
I...

279
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,963
<i>Good times and bum times</i>

280
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,032
<i>I've seen them all
and, my dear</i>

281
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,769
<i>I'm still here</i>

282
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,771
<i>Plush velvet sometimes</i>

283
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,140
<i>Sometimes just
pretzels and beer</i>

284
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,009
<i>But I'm here...</i>

285
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:16,816
Now you know. When I'm alone,
I sing show tunes.

286
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,919
You didn't steal those wallets.
You stole my heart.

287
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,821
Leave it on.

288
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:25,425
<i>Ten years a mob boss,
hits and whacks</i>

289
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:29,695
<i>Bought judges and mayors,
and never paid tax...</i>

290
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,597
Okay, that's enough.

291
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:32,999
Definitely enough.

292
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,639
We're gonna get you out, today.

293
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,175
Appreciate the offer, Chief,

294
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,243
but prison has changed me.

295
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,080
Now I'm thinking I should
just give up, serve out my term,

296
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:51,684
then sit in the warm sun
outside the butcher shop.

297
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,019
Isn't that what you always did?

298
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,254
Yeah, but every few hours,

299
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,857
someone would whisper
something into my ear,

300
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:01,093
then I had to decide
whether to nod or shrug.

301
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,597
It was very stressful.
The agita.

302
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,633
I thought you wanted
to get the guy who put you here.

303
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,868
I do.

304
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:11,871
Well, we will,
if you will wear a wire.

305
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:15,675
I'm sorry, but on principle,
that is something I cannot do.

306
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:20,112
Let me repeat,
something I cannot do.

307
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,073
Now, remember the phrase
to call for help.

308
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,242
- What phrase?
- Remember the phrase.

309
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,077
I will. What phrase is it?

310
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,412
Remember the phrase.

311
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,716
I would if you would
tell me what it is.

312
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,885
The phrase is
remember the phrase.

313
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,254
That is the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

314
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,589
Just remember,
your life depends on us.

315
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,157
Oh, and please, no profanity.

316
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,926
I play these for the missus

317
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,995
when we're...
we're getting in the mood.

318
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,736
A toast to Fat Tony,
a man like a Botticelli nude.

319
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,071
Fat, old and easy to frame, huh?

320
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,909
Hello, fellas.

321
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,977
Fat Tony. I was just saying
how much we missed you.

322
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,479
Huh, guys?

323
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,548
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Yeah, we said that.

324
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,550
Quiet! I don't want
to hear anybody

325
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,552
but Frankie the Squealer.

326
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,388
What do, what do you want
to hear from me?

327
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,561
The name of the man
who framed you? I would never.

328
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,129
I didn't say Johnny Tightlips.

329
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,964
I would never say
Johnny Tightlips.

330
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,500
Ladies and gentlemen,
our new boss, Johnny Tightlips.

331
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,603
So, it was you, Johnny.

332
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,005
- What? Hey!
- You!

333
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,875
After all your
passive-aggressive replies

334
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:59,045
and bitter looks,
I never would've guessed.

335
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:02,148
You mistook my taciturn nature
for fealty.

336
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,617
But it was simply
that I didn't feel comfortable

337
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,419
in social situations.

338
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,987
Then I saw this commercial

339
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:11,457
where a sad cloud
goes on a date with the sun.

340
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:13,993
So I talked to my doctor
about Paxil,

341
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,463
and it gave me the confidence
to betray you.

342
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,736
This is my crew now.
Ain't that right, Jimmy Kissass?

343
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,771
You was always my favorite.

344
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,673
What about you, Sonny Go-along?

345
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,675
I'm good if everyone else is.

346
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:31,877
- Willie Whatever?
- Whatever.

347
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,347
And you,
Joey Can't-Read-the-Room?

348
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,949
You're nuts! Ain't none of us
gonna go along with this!

349
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,585
Yeah, see, that's,
you didn't, that's not...

350
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,797
<i>Just a small town girl...</i>

351
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm surprised Maggie isn't here.

352
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,469
<i>Lonely world</i>

353
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,504
<i>She took the midnight train</i>

354
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,607
<i>Going anywhere...</i>

355
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:04,210
Mmm, this pasta's delicious.

356
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,278
I'm gonna find out
what the sauce is.

357
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,847
Remember the phrase.

358
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,949
Remember what phrase?

359
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:12,184
Oh, right.

360
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:17,390
Ooh, sauce.

361
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,361
I'm hit!

362
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,732
Right in the heart...
of your ass.

363
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,735
Someone's got to suck out
the bullet.

364
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:33,005
Wiggum, damn it, this is
what you were born to do.

365
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,475
<i>Don't stop...</i>

366
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,112
There he is.

367
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,915
We thought we were gonna lose
you for a minute there, champ.

368
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,085
You have the chief here
to thank.

369
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:48,487
His quick suction
may have saved your life.

370
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:50,790
Thank you.

371
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,430
Well, Wiggum, I have to say,
when I first met you,

372
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,565
I thought you were
totally incompetent.

373
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,335
And?

374
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,472
And?

375
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,775
And?! And?! And?!

376
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,844
I believe in you, Chief.

377
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,379
And, yeah, that's enough.

378
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:19,985
The three of us,
we are not that different.

379
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,620
Whoa! Hey, whoa!

380
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,422
What's this guy talking about?

381
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,458
We are cicciobomba,

382
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:29,328
who like to sit in the sun
and enjoy a nice prosciutto.

383
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,630
Cicciobomba, prosciutto.

384
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,133
You guys make garbage
sound good.

385
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,369
We call garbage spazzatura.

386
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:41,407
Mmm, garbage.

387
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,743
Garbage.
