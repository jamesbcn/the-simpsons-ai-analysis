- [Lenny] Yeah, um... Uh. Uh.
- Um. Mmm. Uh. You see...

We kinda made it so that
just my console does that now.

Aw. This whole time I thought I mattered,
but I don't, and I never did.

always running from the darkness.

Without me, they'd be stuck on one side

Ha-ha!
[singsongy] Got your octagonal sign.

- You did it, Dad!

How about one for the paper, Mr. S?

122
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,292

to call, "Chicken Soup for the News."

{\an8}<i>risked his life to save

138

00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,349
{\an8}I don't know.
I guess we could use some new equipment.

142

{\an8}These lawn chairs aren't very comfy,

143
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,521
and these old sashes
don't exactly lift and support.

144
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:23,401
But you know what, Kent?
Keeping kids safe is its own reward.

145
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,361
God bless that saintly dough ball.

146
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:30,866
That's it. I'm giving Springfield's
crossing guards an actual budget.

147
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,868
Not for self-serving political reasons,

148
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,955
but because I'm a man of principle
who wants to do good in the world.

00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,000
Joseph, your turn on the sex chessboard.

150
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,586
We can't very well play without our king.

151
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,589
Though the bishop may try.

Wow. Look at all this orange swag.

Now you'll be getting a full-time salary.

whose heroism got us here,

158
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:10,323
I nominate you as crossing guard captain.

- [Marge] Ooh.
- [Lisa] Whoa.

160
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,039
Look at my handsome man in uniform.

I don't know, Homer.

162
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,543
The only people that wear badges
are power-hungry chumps

Are you talking about that security guard
at the supermarket?

Well, I'm proud of you, Dad.

00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,143
You know what's even better?

170
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:43,855
Volunteering for money!
We're getting paid now.

171
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,233
I even got a budget for ten more guards,

172
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:49,152
and I'm only gonna hire the best
and the brightest.

173
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,737
All right, rookies.

174
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,615
Not all of you are going to
make it through training.

175
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,952
Look to your left. Now look to your right.

176
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,162
That's how you know if a car is coming.

177
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,706
That concludes your training.

178
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:05,710
Hey, uh, Homer. I-I can't thank you enough
for saving my Ralphie's life.

179
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,630
Of course, Chief. Just doing my job.

180
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:12,842
You ever need a parking ticket thrown out
or someone else's DNA left somewhere,

181
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,428
you just let me know.

182
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:15,929
Hmm. [humming]

183
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,517
Arr, Captain, he didn't seek your
permission to cross the seven stripes.

184
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:24,145
Crossing Guard Stu
thinks he's undermining you.

185
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,230
[Homer] Mmm.

186
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,190
- Where's the fire, buddy?
- [shouts]

187
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,192
Do you know how jay
you were walking there, sir?

188
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,194
I-I-I don't know what that means.

189
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,487
All right, wise guy.

190
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,406
I'm gonna have to ask you
to step out of the curb

191
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,199
and keep your feet where I can see them.

192
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,034
I can't even see 'em.

193
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,286
Sir, calm down.

194
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,871
Look, I can let you off
with a warning this time,

195
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,874
but just so you know, I run these streets.

196
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,210
I... Wha... No, you d... I do!

197
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,963
Well, I run all the parts
between the curbs. Got it?

198
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,798
Ooh. These are nice.

199
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,218
I'm gonna hold on to them,
unless you have a problem with that.

200
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:59,723
Yeah, no. No problem at all, um, uh,
"Cross-ifer." Just h-have a nice day.

201
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:04,478
Stupid crossing guards think they're
so tough with their cool orange vests.

202
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:09,274
Another curb kept safe
by Captain Homer J. Simpson.

203
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,358
Boys.

204

Squeaky Voice.

That's Mr. Teen to you, rookie.

209
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,209
These new guys got no respect.

210
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,296
It ain't like when we started
three weeks ago.

211
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,089
Homer, I've been trying to reach you.

212
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:37,052
{\an8}Whoa there, Skinner.
This bar is crossing guards only now.

213
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,805
{\an8}I don't even let Lenny
and Carl in here no more.

214
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,974
Y-Yeah, but did you read my urgent memo?

215
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,269
Tomorrow is the science fair,
bake sale and picture day.

216
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,813
Morning drop-off will be very challenging.

217
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,399
Now, uh, I'm not telling you
how to do your job...

218
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,234
Are you telling me how to do my job?

219
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:56,279
No, I specifically said
I'm not telling you how to do your job.

220
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,449
That's enough, Principal What's-Your-Face.

221
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,951
No pedestrians allowed.

222
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:06,289
But, Homer, if we don't get this right,
it could be pandemonium.

223
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,375
[scoffs] Pandemonium.

224
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,001
{\an8}It's pandemonium, folks.

225
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,671
{\an8}This is Arnie Pye reporting live,
high above

226
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,966
{\an8}an elementary school traffic jam
turned all-out scholastic fracas.

227
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,803
Surely, this town's handsomely paid
crossing guards

228
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,806
can bring order
to this Monday morning mayhem.

229
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,224
Oh. Oh.

230
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,226
Guys, stop it!

231
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,311
[whimpers]

232
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,856
[shouting]

233
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,027
The punching is making things worse.

234
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,947
Don't make me blow my whistle at you.

235
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,031
Captain Simpson!

236
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,159
The shaking of my car
is dangerously close to mixing

237
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,954
the hydrogen peroxide,
yeast and dish soap within.

238
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,038
So?

239
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,043
Those ingredients create a fascinating
yet volatile substance known as...

240
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,506
elephant toothpaste.

241
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,427
This was the most expensive, destructive
and disgusting riot

242
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,178
since the Isotopes won the pennant.

243
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,263
Go, Topes!

244
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:07,392
Crossing Guard Captain Homer Simpson,
what do you have to say for yourself?

245
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,227
{\an8}- Yeah, what?
- You suck!

246
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,979
{\an8}Um, um.

247
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,398
<i>W-What can I do? Who can I blame?</i>

248
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,650
<i>Coastal elites? Avocado socialists?</i>

249
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,736
<i>The boy?</i> [gasps] <i>I got it!</i>

250
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,363
Mr. Mayor, the blame falls squarely

251
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:24,868
on the shoulders
of the crossing guards' inadequate budget.

252
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,245
We need more money!

253
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,164
More money?

254
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,584
{\an8}More money for training, for equipment,
for overtime.

255
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,713
{\an8}So that your children can cross the street
safely at 3:00 a.m. if they want to.

256
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,215
[murmuring]

257
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,262
Throwing money at a deeply flawed
institution is bound to work!

258
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,515
Um. Have you all been
huffing evidence powder?

259
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:51,811
Homer Simpson and his chair jockeys
royally screwed the pooch on this one.

260
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:56,024
And now you want to give him more money?
That makes absolutely no sense.

261
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,067
Listen up, "wokester."

262
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,403
Guys like me are the last line of defense

263
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:05,200
between your schoolkids
and guys like me who text when they drive!

264
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:10,997
And if you don't like it,
you can jaywalk your ass back to Portland.

265

266
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,416
Wha...

267
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,753
All in favor of me pulling
a political 180 on this issue

268
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:20,131
and giving the crossing guards
a blank check, say aye.

269
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,300
- [all] Aye!
- Nay!

270
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,344
Somebody get my enormous checkbook.

271
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,513
[cheering]

272
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,597
It worked.

273
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,141
Maybe I should have asked them
for more just in case.

274
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,394
And, uh, here's some more just in case.

275
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:40,652
Ooh! These Bean Bag Bazookas
can shatter a minivan windshield.

a Bean Bag Bandolier.

I like that we kept our sunglasses
on last night.

281
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,544
I couldn't see a thing.

00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,380
{\an8}Wow, look at all this cool stuff.

Hey, like everyone who comes
into a ton of cash,

00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,975

money and power is subtly corrupting you.

00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:57,223
Homer Simpson can bully this town,
its citizens and their young children,

339
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,559
but he cannot bully me.

340
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,645
Clancy, shut him down.

341
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,647
With pleasure.

342
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,898
[gasps]

343
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:10,528
My anti-Quimby ad got a million likes
on my Thin Orange Line Facebook page.

344
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,655
Look at all these supportive comments.

345
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,867
"Murder Quimby"? "Dismember Quimby"?

346
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,619
"Go back in time and kill baby Quimby"?

347
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,165
Ah, the Internet:
the marketplace of ideas.

348
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,752
You're endangering the lives
of public officials.

349
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,336
Oh, come on.

350
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,047
I'm just slinging a little mud.

351
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,550
- What's the worst that could happen?
- [glass shatters]

352
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,803
[gasps] Dear God.

353
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,891
{\an8}That chair was my best friend
on the force.

354
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,101
Who would dare do this?

355
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,978
[Chief Wiggum] Me would dare.

356
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:47,608
When you mess with the pig,
you get the snout.

357
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,110
This is a chair too far, Wiggum.

358
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:55,073
My crossing guards and your cops
need to settle this once and for all

359
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,159
at the most dangerous place in town.

360
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,203
What, that Brunchausen by Loxy place

361
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,330
that's been poisoning
everyone for attention?

362
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:06,168
No, the six-way intersection.

363
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,004
Well, well.

364
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:14,175
I thought cops only showed up
after something bad happens.

365
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,344
[laughing]

366
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,679
We are sick of you crossing guards

367
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,391
and your unaccountable, super macho, hypersensitive,

368
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:25,645
crazily militarized malarkey.

369
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,146
That's our thing, damn it.

370
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,607
No, that's our thing.

371
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,192
Who the hell are you?

372
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:35,905
We're ICE, keeping this country safe from
cleaning ladies and college-age Dreamers.

373
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,490
We're America's heroes.

374
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,325
You wish, kid cagers.

375
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,576
It's the TSA.

376
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:45,373
We keep this country safe,
one confiscated shampoo bottle at a time.

377
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,042
{\an8}Think again, shoe sniffers.

378
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:52,255
{\an8}The only force holding society together
is America's meter maids.

379
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,298
{\an8}And meter butlers.

380
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,925
No, it's us.

381
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:59,637
Overzealous neighborhood watch guys
in right-to-carry states.

382
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,806
- [shouts, groans]
- Whoops. Sorry, Clem.

383
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,307
[all shouting]

384
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,059
[air horn blares]

385
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,895
You all think you keep America safe?

386
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:12,066
Pfft. How? By hassling grandmas
and wrecking quinceañeras?

387
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,485
By grazing my junk with your wand?

388
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:18,948
Or arresting bank robbers who rob banks?

389
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,702
Unlike all of you,
I've earned the right to feel godlike.

390
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,037
I've actually saved a life.

391
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,874
[person]
Um. We save lives every day, bruh.

392
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,125
{\an8}Shut up, lifeguards.

393
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,459
{\an8}This is a land argument.

394
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,421
But if the rest of you wanna get nuts,
then come on.

395
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,797
Let's get nuts.

396
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,634
But mark my words,
before you cross the crossing guards,

397
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,596
you better look both wa...

398
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,681
[grunts]

399
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,224
Hey, everybody. I'm back. I...

400
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,309
Uh-oh.

401
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,103
[Homer groaning]

402
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,772
Am I gonna go to jail now?

403
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,399
I wouldn't dream of it.

404
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,151
[cheering]

405
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,779
Well, I hope you learned
a valuable lesson, Dad.

406
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,406
Absolute power cor...

407
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,908
Is the best kind of power there is?

408
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,576
Is a warm Bean Bag Bazooka?

409
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:07,914
Does bad things to society
and does strange things to me.

410
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,165
No.

411
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:13,836
Once you militarized the crossing guards,
they became an army in search of an enemy.

412
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,756
And if the only tool you have is a hammer,

413
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,759
then everything
starts to look like a nail.

414
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,761
Perhaps. But on the other hand...

415
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,054
[belches, laughs]

416
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,223
- [groans] Mom.
- [chuckling] Gotcha.

417
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,350
Bart, say, "Excuse me."

418
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:31,145
I don't care if he says, "Excuse me."
I want him not to burp in my face!

419
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,397
- Lighten up, Lis.
- [Lisa] Is it so much to ask?

420
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,650
- [Bart] I'm not gonna apologize.
- [Lisa] He always does this.

421
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,527
- [Homer] Must hammer nails.
- [Lisa] Have you smelled that burp?

422
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,696
{\an8}<i>♪ If I had a hammer ♪</i>

423
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,658
{\an8}<i>♪ I'd hammer in the morning ♪</i>

424
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,077
{\an8}[music continues]

425
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,123
Shh!
