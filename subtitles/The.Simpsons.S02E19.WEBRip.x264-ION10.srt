{\an8}Did you hear
about Miss Hoover?

{\an8}She drank a bottle
of drain cleaner by mistake.

6
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,117
{\an8}I heard she fell down

{\an8}Children,
I won't be staying long.

{\an8}I just came from the doctor,
and I have lyme disease.

12
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,745
{\an8}Principal Skinner

14
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,720
{\an8}-What's lyme disease?
-I'll field that one.

15
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,139
{\an8}Lyme disease is spread
by small parasites called ticks.

16
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,219
{\an8}When a diseased tick
attaches itself to you

17
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,715
{\an8}-and begins sucking your blood,
-Ohh.

18
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,766
{\an8}malignant spirochetes
infest your bloodstream,

19

And here comes snowball two.
This is the one we kept.

Eww!

00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,843
We were gonna keep the gray one,
but the mother ate her.

00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,459
KIDS:
Eww!

32
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,835
Mrs. Krabappel,

33
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,722
he's traumatizing
the children.

34
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,379
As usual,
I agree with you, Martin.

35
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,137
Bart, shut that off
and take your seat immediately.

36
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,719
Oh look, this is really cool.

37
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,144

I can make 'em go back in.

00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,983
No, children,
you're not seeing things.

40
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,614
This, my little friends,
is a schwa.

00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,570
-Are you the substitute?
-Yes, sir.

43
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,697
-Yes, I am.
-Are you insane?

44
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,744
No sir, no I'm not.
It's my way of getting their attention.

45
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,208
Well, all right.
Uh, play friendly

46
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,418
with your new teacher,
children.

47
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,879
Howdy. I am a Texas cowboy.
The year is 1830.

48
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,671
You young'uns ask me
any questions you like.

49
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,384
Can we play kickball instead
of science after lunch?

50
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,425
Kickball? Son, there ain't
no kickball in 1830.

51
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,720
Any other questions?

52
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,644
Shoot, it's awfully quiet
on the plains here.

53
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,272
Well, how about this? Everybody?
I want to see two eyes

54
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,810
on every single person
staring right at me right now.

55
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,984
There are three things wrong
with my costume.

56
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:31,033
Anybody names those three
things will get my hat.

57
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,689
I believe I know the answer.

58
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,317
-What's your name?
-Lisa Simpson.

59
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,485
-Well, go ahead, Miss Simpson.
-Um, one.

60
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,584
Your belt buckle says
"State of Texas,"

61
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,949
but Texas wasn't a state
until 1845.

62
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,116
-Very good.
-Two.

63
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:47,375
-The revolver wasn't invented until 1835.
-That's excellent.

64
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,338
Three. You seem to be
of the Jewish faith.

65
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,209
Are you sure I'm Jewish?

66
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,455
-Or Italian.
-I'm Jewish.

67
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,956
And there weren't
any Jewish cowboys.

68
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,047
Very good. That's excellent.

69
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,803
I'm also wearing a digital watch,
but I'll accept that.

70
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,795
Here you go, little lady.
And for the record,

71
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,137
there were a few Jewish cowboys,
ladies and gentlemen.

72
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,772
Big guys who were great shots
and spent money freely.

73
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,060
I'm Mr. Bergstrom. Feel free to
make fun of my name if you want.

74
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,645
Two suggestions
are "Mr. Nerdstrom"

75
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,650
and "Mr. Booger-strom."

76
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,732
(class laughing)

77
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:16,857
Boys and girls, today we will begin
selecting a class president.

78
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,526
I'm not allowed to vote,

79
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,825
but I strongly suggest
you elect Martin. Martin?

80
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,659
As your president,

81
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,794
I would demand
a science fiction library

82
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,882
featuring an A-B-C
of the overlords of the genre:

83
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,709
Asimov, Bester, Clarke...

84
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,085
-What about Ray Bradbury?
-I'm aware of his work.

85
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:40,013
Thank you,
and keep watching the skies!

86
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,974
Excellent! Excellent! Martin!

87
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,886
If you're through
with your pemmican,

88
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:48,104
why don't we sing a song
about cowboys?

89
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,686
Now, this one's not
very accurate,

90
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,071
but we can fix it up
as we go along. Okay?

91
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:56,988
<i>♪ Home,</i>
<i>home on the range ♪</i>

92
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,160
(quietly) Actually, the range
was far from home.

93
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,659
It was a very desolate place

94
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,330
where danger and disease
rode tall in the saddle.

95
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:08,709
<i>♪ Where the deer</i>
<i>and the antelope play ♪</i>

96
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,830
(whispering) But unlike
the efficient Indians,

97
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,707
cowboys used only the tongue
of the antelope,

98
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,344
and they threw the rest away.

99
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,380
<i>♪ Where seldom is heard ♪</i>

100
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,635
<i>-♪ A discouraging word ♪</i>
- (giggling)

101
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:26,558
{\an8}<i>♪ And the skies are</i>
<i>not cloudy all day. ♪</i>

102
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,851
Hey, what's this?
Did you do it?

103
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,306
No, it wasn't me. I would never do
anything like that.

104
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,567
It was just one of those immature people
who, instead of building themselves up--

105
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,319
It's neat.
Can I have it?

106
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,741
Yes, but I didn't do it.

107
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,399
Are you sure you didn't?
It's good.

108
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,907
No, but I'm starting
to wish I had.

109
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,910
(chuckles) Ladies and gentlemen:
The Singing Dork.

110
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,162
(whispering)
Lisa.

111
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,455
(snickering)

112
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,749
Any other nominations?

113
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,712
TOGETHER:
We nominate Bart Simpson.

114
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,592
Speech! Speech!

115
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,589
I had a speech ready,
but my dog ate it.

116
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,421
-(kids laughing)
-Children!

117
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,256
Good. Bart, I need
someone very reliable

118
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,472
to deliver an important message
to the principal's office.

119
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,514
-Would you do it for me?
-Why Mrs. Krabappel,

120
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,017
how would I know where
the principal's office is?

121
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,100
-(laughing)
-(clapping and cheering)

122
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:15,356
People, what have I told you
about encouraging him?

123
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,440
When Bart wins approval for making a fool
of himself, it makes him think that--

124
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:21,066
-Yay, Bart!
-(hysterical laughing )

125
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,324
(chanting)
Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart!

126
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,156
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

127
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,122
"Nobody...

128
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:32,002
"of the hundreds of people
that had visited the fair

129
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:35,171
"knew that a gray spider

130
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,551
"had played the most
important part of all.

131
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:42,589
No one was with her
when she died."

132
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,465
(crying)

133
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,394
Come on, Janey!
Everybody has a talent.

134
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,314
I want to see yours.
That's all.

135
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,692
-I don't have a talent.
-You can not talk like that.

136
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,980
There has to be something that
you can do better than anybody else.

137
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,645
Well, I can do this.

138
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,444
Yes! Great.

139
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,647
Okay. How about you, Ralph?

140
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,698
Wonderful! Chuck.

141
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,865
Oh, that's disgusting.
I love it.

142
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,952
Lisa! Come on,
you're holding out on us.

143
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,328
-I see a saxophone over there.
-I can't.

144
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,165
Come on, Lisa.
I bet you're good.

145
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,290
No, really, I can't.

146
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,957
Sure, you can.
Just try.

147
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,415
Please don't make me do it.

148
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,255
All right, you owe me
something special.

149
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,880
(bell ringing)

150
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,586
(laughing and chattering)

151
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,805
So... while I'm technically
still married,

152
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,850
there really hasn't been
any marriage to speak of

153
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:36,524
since Mister Krabappel moved
into his little love nest.

154
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,574
This profession can put
a lot of strain on a marriage.

155
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,069
Since he's been gone,

156
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,030
I've been looking
for a substitute

157
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,661
to teach me a lesson
I sorely need.

158
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,368
Mrs. Krabappel,
you're trying to seduce me.

159
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,829
(chuckles)
Well?

160
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,829
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Krabappel.

161
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,001
You're very nice,
but it's the children I love.

162
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,621
(sighing)

163
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,167
Oh...

164
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,090
(saxophone playing the blues)

165
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,278
When I fall asleep,

166
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,069
Mr. Bergstrom is
the last thing I think of.

167
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,903
And he's my first thought
when I wake up.

168
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,818
I feel that way
about your father.

169
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,776
No, no. You don't understand.

170
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,787
When Mr. Bergstrom smiles,
you only see these teeth.

171
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,000
But when you really make him laugh,
you can see these two teeth.

172
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,750
I think they're called
the eye teeth?

173
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,922
I don't know if he had
orthodontic work or what,

174
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,591
but they're absolutely perfect.

175
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,339
I notice little things
about your father too.

176
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,672
No, Mom. This is different.

177
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,177
I mean, this man makes you feel
like there's nobody better.

178
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,050
Your father does that to me.

179
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,257
Mom, are we going to talk,
or are we going to talk?

180
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,927
Lisa, we can talk, but first you have
to accept the fact

181
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,597
-that I feel that way about your father.
-Fine.

182
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,226
Yesterday he read us
"Charlotte's Web"

183
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,984
and cried at the end,
never trying to hide his tears.

184
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:08,106
-(laughing)
-(laughing)

185
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,236
A book made him cry?

186
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,453
-Boo-hoo!
-Waaaah!

187
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,743
(groaning)

188
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,707
Mr. Bergstrom: Remember,
nobody, and I mean nobody

189
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:20,168
gets back in after lunch
without one igneous rock--

190
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,789
that's volcanic--

191
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,536
and one sedimentary,
and that is layered.

192
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,168
Lisa, can I see you
for a minute?

193
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,424
Yes! Yes, Mr. Bergstrom?

194
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,217
Lisa, your homework is always so neat.
How can I put this?

195
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,301
Does your father
help you with it?

196
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,636
No. Homework's
not my father's specialty.

197
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,222
Well, there's no shame in it.
I mean, my Dad--

198
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,767
-Not mine.
-You didn't let me finish.

199
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,100
Unless the next word
was "burp, "

200
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,185
you didn't have to.

201
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,110
In a sample taken
in this very classroom,

202
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:49,150
a state inspector found 1.74 parts
per million of asbestos!

203
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,317
That's not enough.
We demand more asbestos.

204
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,366
More asbestos!
More asbestos!

205
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,450
(kids chanting)
More asbestos! More asbestos!

206
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,956
(camera shutter clicks)

207
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,578
Wow! You made the front page.

208
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,456
Aw, Dad, it's just
a popularity contest.

209
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,923
Just a popularity contest?

210
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,843
Excuse me, what's more
important than popularity?

211
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,343
Now, Bart, do you really
think you can win?

212
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,385
-Sure. Why not?
-Whoo-whoo!

213
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,719
All right. I always knew
you had personality.

214
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,385
The doctor said it was hyperactivity
but I knew better.

215
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,354
President Simpson.

216
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,194
Has a nice ring to it,
doesn't it, boy?

217
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,521
Hmm... yeah.

218
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,725
-Now, go get 'em!
-(growling)

219
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,107
He says there aren't
any easy answers.

220
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,954
I say he's not looking
hard enough!

221
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,660
(kids cheering)

222
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,542
(kids chanting)
Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart!

223
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,552
(laughing)

224
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,588
(cheering)

225
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,972
(kids chanting)
Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart!

226
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,773
(kids cheering)

227
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,770
(sighs)
Oh, you'll never go broke

228
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,442
appealing to the lowest
common denominator.

229
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,150
You're gonna miss
your brother's antics.

230
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,150
-When?
-When? When your life takes you places

231
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,402
the rest of us
have only heard about.

232
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,744
{\an8}Places where my intelligence will be
an asset and not a liability?

233
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,620
Yes. There is such a place.
Believe me, it's true.

234
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,368
I believe everything you say

235
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,490
with your words,
your body language,

236
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,407
and your Semitic good looks.

237
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,495
"Dear Miss Hoover,
You have lyme disease.

238
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,922
"We miss you.

239
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,130
"Kevin's biting me.

240
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,419
"Come back soon.

241
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,502
"Here is a drawing
of a spirochete.

242
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,048
-Love, Ralph."
-Oh, that's great, Ralph.

243
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,802
-(bell ringing)
-Hey, kids!

244
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,264
I've learned
that in two weeks,

245
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,854
the Springfield
Museum of Natural History

246
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:41,308
will be closing forever
due to a lack of interest.

247
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,930
I urge you to see it
while you can.

248
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,348
(slurping)

249
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:49,356
Hmm. Lisa needs to go
to the museum tomorrow,

250
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,230
and I think
you should take her.

251
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,317
-The museum? Tomorrow?
-Mm-hmm.

252
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:57,452
Oh, Marge, I'd love to,
but I was planning on...

253
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,831
(thinking) <i>Sleeping?</i>
<i>Eating a big sandwich?</i>

254
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,329
<i>Watching TV?</i>
<i>Spending time with the boy!</i>

255
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,791
Spending time with the boy.
The boy needs attention, Marge.

256
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,792
Homer, I've been talking
to Lisa,

257
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,214
and I'm concerned about
your relationship with her.

258
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,672
Me, too, Mom.

259
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,342
-I think they're drifting apart.
-Shut up, boy.

260
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,300
-Homer, please!
-Marge, you don't understand.

261
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,682
I can't do it because--
<i>You're trapped.</i>

262
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,469
<i>If you were smarter,</i>
<i>you might think of something.</i>

263
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,602
<i>But you're not.</i>
<i>So you just might as well--</i>

264
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,720
All right, all right,
I'll take her.

265
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,387
Lousy brain.

266
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:29,766
Hey, what do you mean
by "suggested donation"?

267
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,565
Pay any amount you wish, sir.

268
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,149
And what if I wish
to pay zero?

269
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,775
(chuckles)
Well, it's up to you.

270
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,951
Ooh, so it's up
to me, is it?

271
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,740
-Yes.
-I see.

272
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,874
And you think that people
are gonna pay you $4.50

273
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,413
even though
they don't have to

274
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,076
just out of the goodness
of their--

275
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,544
(laughing)
Well, anything you say.

276
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,956
Good luck, lady.

277
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,134
You're going to need it.

278
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,672
-Mr. Bergstrom!
-Hi, Lisa.

279
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,046
Hey! you don't have to pay.
Read the sign.

280
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,764
-And this must be your father.
-(sighs)

281
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,505
His teeth had jagged edges
to rip through your body,

282
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,347
but he could've
swallowed you whole.

283
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,733
-Wow!
-Actually, Mr. Simpson,

284
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,730
they do know a great deal about
the process of mummification.

285
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,573
First they pulled the brain out
through the nose with an iron hook.

286
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,319
then stuffed the insides
with sawdust and onions.

287
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,201
{\an8}-Eww! Gross!
-Ooh! Pretty creepy.

288
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,699
Still, I'd rather have him
chasing me than The Wolfman.

289
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,121
Oh, Lord.

290
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,962
Mr. Simpson, I am going
to be presumptuous.

291
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,882
I have noticed
that Lisa seems to feel

292
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,801
she has no strong
male role model.

293
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,670
-She said that?
-Well, no, she didn't say it,

294
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,968
-but, you know, she--
-But you can tell, right?

295
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,971
She looks around and sees everybody
else's dad with a good education,

296
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,064
youthful looks,
and a clean credit record

297
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,520
and thinks, "Why me?
What did I do to deserve

298
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,271
-this fat, old piece of--
-Mr. Simpson,

299
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,982
you have got to be
a bigger man.

300
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,402
There is a wonderful girl's
future at stake.

301
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,442
Well, if she's so wonderful,
give her an "A."

302
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,775
I am giving her an "A."

303
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,950
Great, but don't tell her it was
a favor to me. Tell her she earned it.

304
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,819
Mr. Simpson, she did earn it!

305
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,776
You are smooth.
I'll give you that.

306
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,956
He ruined the one chance
I had of getting

307
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,630
to know Mr. Bergstrom
outside of school.

308
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,129
Well, I'll tell you what.

309
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,212
Why don't we invite
Mr. Bergstrom to dinner?

310
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,667
Oh, Mom, that's wonderful!

311
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,878
Can I find out
his favorite dish

312
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,177
-and help you make it?
-Sure!

313
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,430
-Can I wear your jewelry?
-Sure!

314
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,512
-Can I get my ears pierced?
-No.

315
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,716
-Can I dye my shoes pink?
-Yes.

316
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,926
-Can I paint my nails?
-No.

317
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,225
-Can we have wine? Can I have wine?
-Yes. No.

318
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,389
- Does Bart have to be there?
- Yes.

319
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,017
Can we do it this week?

320
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,363
"Mr. Bergstrom,
May we request the pleasure

321
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,729
of your company..."
No.

322
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,397
"Mr. Bergstrom, if you're
not doing anything

323
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,275
this Friday..." No.

324
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,742
"Mr. Bergstrom,
Do you like pork chops?"

325
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,123
Oh, no,
of course you wouldn't.

326
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,541
(gasps)

327
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,159
Good morning, Lisa.
I'm back.

328
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,047
You see, class, my lyme
disease turned out to be...

329
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,760
ahem, psy-cho-somatic.

330
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,262
Does that mean you're crazy?

331
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,763
No, that means
she was faking it.

332
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,675
No, actually,
it was a little of both.

333
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,473
Sometimes, when a disease
is in all the magazines

334
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,178
and on all the news shows,

335
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,518
it's only natural
that you think you have it.

336
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,733
-Where's Mr. Bergstrom?
-I don't know.

337
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,074
Although I'd sure like
to talk to him.

338
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,949
He didn't touch my lesson plan.
What did he teach you?

339
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,278
That life is worth living.
(gasps)

340
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,074
(crying)

341
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,787
The polls will be open from
now until the end of recess.

342
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,959
Now, just in case any of you have
decided to put any thought into this,

343
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,129
we'll have our
final statements.

344
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,208
Martin?

345
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,343
I don't think there's
anything left to say.

346
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,381
-Bart?
-Victory party under the slide!

347
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,384
(cheering)

348
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,603
(buzzing)

349
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,428
{\an8}Mr. Bergstrom!

350
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,144
{\an8}Mr. Bergstrom!

351
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,484
Hey! Hey!
He moved out this morning.

352
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,310
He must have a new job--
He took his Copernicus costume.

353
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,396
Do you know where
I can find him?

354
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,821
Uh, I think he's taking
the next train to Capital City.

355
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,191
The train, how like him.

356
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,988
Traditional,
yet environmentally sound.

357
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,662
Yes, and it's been
the backbone of our country

358
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,952
since Leland Stanford drove that
golden spike at Promontory Point.

359
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,288
-I see he touched you too.
-(both sigh)

360
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,634
-Thanks for your vote, man.
-I didn't vote. Voting's for geeks.

361
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,591
Well, you got that right.

362
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,471
Thanks for your vote, girls.

363
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,838
BOTH: We forgot.

364
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,045
Well, don't sweat it.

365
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,184
Just so long as a couple
of people did.

366
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,680
-Right, Milhouse?
-Uh-uh.

367
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,262
-Lewis?
-No.

368
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,847
-Somebody must have voted.
-What about you, Bart?

369
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,273
-Didn't you vote?
-Uh-oh.

370
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,062
-(school bell)
-(screaming)

371
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:42,516
(cheering)

372
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,818
I demand a recount.

373
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,702
One for Martin.
Two for Martin.

374
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,819
-Would you like another recount?
-No.

375
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,776
Well, I just wanna make sure.

376
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:54,656
One for Martin. Two for Martin.
(chuckles)

377
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:55,655
This way, Mr. President.

378
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,461
MAN (on P.A.):
<i>Now boarding on track five...</i>

379
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,424
Mr. Bergstrom!

380
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,085
Hey, Mr. Bergstrom!

381
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,513
Hey! Lisa!

382
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,342
Hey, Lisa, indeed.

383
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,547
What? What is it?

384
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,678
Oh, I mean...

385
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,685
Were you just going to
leave, just like that?

386
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,518
Aw, I'm sorry, Lisa.

387
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,773
You know, it's the life
of the substitute teacher.

388
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,016
He's a fraud.

389
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,938
Today he might be
wearing gym shorts,

390
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,196
tomorrow he's speaking
French or pretending

391
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,949
to know how to run a band saw,

392
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,201
-or God knows what.
-You can't go.

393
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,203
You're the best teacher
I'll ever have.

394
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,705
Aw, that's not true.
Other teachers will come along.

395
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,868
-Oh, please!
-No, I can't lie to you, I am the best,

396
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,708
but, you know, they need me over
in the projects of Capital City.

397
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,174
(nearly whispering)
But I need you too.

398
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,125
That's the problem
with being middle class.

399
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,796
Anybody who really cares
will abandon you

400
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,054
for those who need it more.

401
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:56,096
I... I understand.

402
00:16:56,181 --> 00:17:00,351
Mr. Bergstrom,
I'm going to miss you.

403
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,435
I'll tell you what.

404
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,442
Whenever you feel
like you're alone

405
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,645
and there's nobody
you can rely on,

406
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,356
this is all you need to know.

407
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,567
Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom.

408
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,697
MAN: All aboard!

409
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,243
So, I guess this is it.

410
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,117
If you don't mind,

411
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,004
I'll just run alongside
the train

412
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,422
as it speeds you
from my life.

413
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,142
Good-bye, Lisa honey.

414
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:42,733
It'll be okay.
Just read the note!

415
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,611
(train whistle blows)

416
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,359
HOMER:
Bart didn't get one vote?

417
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,815
Oh, this is the worst thing
that could ever happen to us.

418
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,327
All right, all right,

419
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,198
spilt milk, spilt milk,
spilt milk.

420
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,495
-What are you so mopey about?
-Nothing.

421
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,749
Lisa, tell your father.

422
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,791
Mr. Bergstrom
left today.

423
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,335
-Oh?
-He's gone forever.

424
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,169
-And?
-I didn't think you'd understand.

425
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:14,965
Hey! Just because I don't
care doesn't mean I don't understand.

426
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,762
I'm glad I'm not crying,

427
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,426
because I would hate
for you to think

428
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:23,055
that what I'm about to say
is based on emotion.

429
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,443
-But you, sir--
-Huh?

430
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,191
-...are a baboon!
-(gasps) Me?

431
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,283
Yes, you! Baboon! Baboon!
Baboon! Baboon!

432
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,860
I don't think you realize
what you're saying.

433
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,116
(screaming)
Baboon!

434
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,778
-(crying)
-Whoa.

435
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,447
Somebody was bound
to say it one day.

436
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,406
I just can't believe
it was her.

437
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,075
Did you hear that, Marge?

438
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,333
She called me a baboon!

439
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,625
The stupidest, ugliest,
smelliest ape of them all.

440
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,590
Homer, you're not allowed to have
hurt feelings right now.

441
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,972
There's a little girl upstairs
who needs you.

442
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,299
Her confidence
in her father is shaken,

443
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,805
and no little girl can be happy
unless she has faith in her daddy.

444
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,888
(groans)

445
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,814
Oh.

446
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,733
(reading)
"Go away."

447
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,063
(sobbing)

448
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,108
Lisa, don't hold
anything back.

449
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,112
You can tell me.

450
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,574
Are you crying because
you called Daddy a baboon?

451
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,316
-No!
-Nuts.

452
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,908
D'oh!

453
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,253
-This isn't going well at all.
-Look!

454
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,579
-If you just want me to forgive you--
-No, no, no.

455
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,915
I just wish
I knew what to say.

456
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,381
(melancholy music playing)

457
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,011
Although,
maybe this music will help.

458
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:37,429
Now, you lost someone
special, and it hurts.

459
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:41,049
I'm lucky, because I never
lost anyone special to me.

460
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,098
Everyone special to me
is under this roof.

461
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,023
-Oh...
-It's true.

462
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,981
Now, you'll have lots of special people
in your life, Lisa.

463
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:53,153
There's probably someplace
where they all get together,

464
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,703
and the food is real good,
and guys like me are serving drinks.

465
00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:01,158
Oh, well, maybe
I can't explain all this,

466
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,201
but I can fix
your dollhouse for you.

467
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,705
At least I'm good
at monkey work.

468
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,578
You know? Monkey?

469
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,825
{\an8}-You know what I mean?
-Yeah.

470
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,998
{\an8}Bet I can hold these nails
in place with my tail.

471
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,466
-(both chuckle)
-(imitating monkey)

472
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,178
(laughing)

473
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,679
You're so silly.

474
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,721
-Give me a banana.
-I don't have any bananas.

475
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,635
Come on, you're
holding out on me.

476
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,774
(both laughing)

477
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,690
I'm sorry I called you
a baboon, Dad.

478
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,073
Think nothing of it.

479
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,403
BART: President prince,
president princess,

480
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,857
president priss...

481
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,075
Hey, what's the matter, son?

482
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,739
Aw, Dad...

483
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,907
If just me, Milhouse,
and Louis had voted.

484
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,537
Hey, son,
would you have gotten

485
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,875
any money for being
class president?

486
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,051
-No.
-Would you have to do extra work?

487
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,299
-Yeah.
-And, is this Martin guy

488
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,052
going to get to do
anything neat,

489
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:03,303
like throw out the first ball
at the World Series? Huh?

490
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,887
-Well, no.
-So let the baby have his bottle, huh?

491
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,894
-That's my motto.
-(both laughing)

492
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,398
Hey, thanks, monkey man.

493
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,897
Holy moly,
talk about parenting.

494
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,486
-(fussing)
-Uh-oh.

495
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,291
Sleep well, Maggie.

496
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,038
Ah. Three for three.

497
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,248
Homey, did you straighten
everything out?

498
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,752
Ah, bup, bup, bup, bup!

499
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,964
Don't say anything, Marge.

500
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,174
Let's just go to bed.

501
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,674
I'm on the biggest roll
of my life.
