1
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:13,881
Mmm. Jam.

2
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:26,860
Okay, okay.

3
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:29,197
The only explanation
is I'm still asleep,

4
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,399
dreaming that
the house is flooded.

5
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:34,168
What does it mean?
What does it mean?

6
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:36,170
It probably means
you're under a lot of stress

7
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:39,006
because this is not a dream
and the house is flooded.

8
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,609
- D'oh!
- Cowabunga!

9
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,847
Oh, my God.
This is horrible!

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,716
Although, I do like
the sofa better

11
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,218
where the water's carrying it.

12
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,725
How did this happen?

13
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:01,195
Homie, I don't like
where the painting is.

14
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,696
Maybe you're upset
about something else.

15
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,731
Are you hungry?

16
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:05,233
Why don't you make
some pork chops?

17
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:06,400
Fine.

18
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:09,303
Now can you hang the painting?

19
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:11,439
Always with the painting.

20
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,943
Perfect.
Wait, no, no, it's not.

21
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:18,546
Try again.

22
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,449
No, split the difference.

23
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,885
See?

24
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:28,756
When you listen to me,
we make a great team.

25
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,759
It's almost like
I can hear the ocean.

26
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,894
I guess we're both at fault.

27
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,729
In a way, that's refreshing.

28
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,831
Do you want me
to apologize anyway?

29
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:40,934
- I'd be happy to.
- No, thanks, sweetie.

30
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:43,837
Well, either way, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:46,407
Okay, now, when we try
to sell the house,

32
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,576
no one mention the water.

33
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,578
Just tell me
you paid the insurance.

34
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,446
You mean that bill
that's floating right there?

35
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,349
It's not due
till tomorrow, so relax.

36
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:58,586
My origami project.

37
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,022
Don't worry, sweetie.
We'll have a funeral for it.

38
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,024
All right.

39
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,861
I'll just pull up your policy.
Alt-Control-F... Damn it!

40
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,097
Kate! Kate, can you get in here?

41
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,467
It's a different generation that
knows how to work these things.

42
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,606
- Enjoy.
- The kids, huh?

43
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,275
They just know how to do it.
Now let's see here.

44
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,012
You're in luck!
The policy I sold you

45
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,381
covers the full
replacement value of your house.

46
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,819
We also pay for six months
temporary housing.

47
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:34,655
Now the bad news. Your policy
is the only one I've sold.

48
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,224
It just cost
the company a bundle,

49
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:37,991
and I'm gonna lose my job.

50
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,960
Gee, sorry, ol' Gil.

51
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,130
That's okay, I got options,
unemployment, suicide.

52
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,466
When one door closes,
a coffin opens.

53
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,302
What am I saying?
I don't make coffin money.

54
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,638
But now I got something
to work towards!

55
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,139
That's right.

56
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,108
Kate, can you tell me
how to charge a cell phone?

57
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:59,980
Whoa, whoa, whoa, so wall holes
make things charge?

58
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,715
What's next?

59
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,355
There are some nice Airbnb
options on the Westside.

60
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,659
I'd feel kind of weird

61
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,663
sleeping in the bedroom
of someone I know.

62
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,998
Everything okay with the room?

63
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,833
You're not
supposed to be back

64
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,669
from your vacation
for three weeks.

65
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,371
It's not a vacation.

66
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:25,506
My dad is doing
seasonal fruit picking.

67
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,174
Come on, Milhouse.

68
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,511
I need you on my shoulders
to reach the high apples.

69
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,513
And I don't want to be in a room

70
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,949
where guys walked around
with their dinguses out.

71
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:38,686
No! No, don't imagine that!

72
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,691
So, son, word on the street is
you've come into some money.

73
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,225
Yeah?

74
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:48,462
I was wondering, you know,
just hear me out...

75
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:51,064
I've always considered you
a friend, and...

76
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,066
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

77
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,736
This is the most precious kind
of money there is.

78
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,738
Unearned, and it's mine.

79
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,907
And you're not getting at it
just because you need

80
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,310
a bigger TV or a room
with a window or...

81
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:03,811
An operation.

82
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:06,547
You need an operation?
What's the matter?

83
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,316
If it's all the same,
it's embarrassing,

84
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:10,384
and I'd rather not
discuss it publicly.

85
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:11,885
Really? What could it be?

86
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,822
Look, it's important to me
and pricey.

87
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,624
What could it be?

88
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,329
Pane in the ass?

89
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,565
Hands off!

90
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,233
I need professional help!

91
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,769
Not to worry.
This is the United States.

92
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,171
We have the third best
health care system

93
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,573
in North America.

94
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,174
Hi, Medicare!

95
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,410
I mean, hi, every-money.

96
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:38,679
Can I speak
with the doctor alone?

97
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:41,081
Of course.

98
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,250
Oh, wait, I'm the doctor.

99
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,420
That's why I wear
the heart listening tube.

100
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:48,456
Ba-boom, ba-boom.

101
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,458
That never gets old.

102
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,461
What's taking Grampa
so long in there?

103
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:56,364
It's crazy that medical costs
are so high here.

104
00:04:56,397 --> 00:05:00,768
In Denmark, to pick a country
at random, health care is free.

105
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,438
Free? Honey, nothing
is free but Splendas.

106
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:07,508
In Denmark, they make everyone
pay high taxes.

107
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,042
Even rich people.

108
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,379
Yes, and they get
free health care.

109
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:13,447
It's called socialism.

110
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:17,217
Socialism? But all my radio
loudmouths tell me to hate that.

111
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,387
That doc can't do
nothing for me.

112
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,990
You know, if Grampa was in
Denmark and he had an accident,

113
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,826
he'd get medical care for free!

114
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,828
I can't go to Denmark by myself.

115
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,297
I get lost in the middle
of a sentence,

116
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,301
and that was the best pie
I ever had.

117
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,804
Wait a minute. What if we used
our insurance money

118
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,172
to take a family trip
to Denmark?

119
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,841
Why would we want
to go to Denmark?

120
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:44,011
It is the happiest country
on earth, in poll after poll.

121
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:47,648
I got your poll right here.

122
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,982
Hey, you're right.

123
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,184
Homer, you've got
the vacation coming.

124
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,320
We've got the money.
It's settled.

125
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,090
We're going to Denmark,
and Grampa will get fixed.

126
00:05:57,124 --> 00:06:00,528
Well, Homer, looks like
Marge is the boss in your house.

127
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,362
Well, I say we don't go!

128
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,231
But we need to go.
I'm desperate!

129
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:05,699
Fine, we'll go.

130
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:08,802
That woman's got you
right under her thumb.

131
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,111
None of these were chosen

132
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,448
as the name of our airline.
Danish Air.

133
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:25,018
Excuse me, sir, the no smoking
sign has been illuminated.

134
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:29,723
Sorry.

135
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:32,526
The flight attendants
are so sweet.

136
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,295
We will be landing
in Copenhagen shortly.

137
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,798
If you have been designing
and building furniture

138
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:41,669
during the flight, please apply
your final coat of varnish now.

139
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,873
Hey, I got things done too.

140
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,875
What the...?!

141
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,444
Denmark,
the jewel of the Baltic.

142
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,046
First-class schools,
sleek furniture design,

143
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,414
energy independence,

144
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:58,552
and brooding TV dramas
about teenagers getting killed.

145
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:01,154
Thank you so much
for renting my apartment.

146
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:02,956
It's so efficient.

147
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,730
Please allow me to give you
a tour of Copenhagen.

148
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,233
Wonderful. But first, a nap.

149
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,504
No, Homer.
You slept on the plane.

150
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:19,306
You slept through customs.
You slept on the bus.

151
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,241
How can you sleep now?

152
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,011
Don't you hear
Copenhagen calling?

153
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,046
Take a message.

154
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,125
The people here are
so openly affectionate.

155
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,693
Why don't we all hold hands?

156
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:41,862
Are we supposed to
interlock fingers or not?

157
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,330
Cramp! Cramp!

158
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:44,865
Dad's hands
are covered with jam.

159
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:47,300
- I can't get it off!
- Grampa's hands are too rough.

160
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,603
- Lisa's hands are too soft.
- Just keep holding.

161
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:51,539
Oh, don't worry,
the government will pay you

162
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53,106
to learn this social skill.

163
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,375
Homer, you are
holding your own hand.

164
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:59,212
They're fighting over a Danish.

165
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,549
Created in 1913,
The Little Mermaid

166
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,951
is a world-famous icon
of Denmark.

167
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,186
No, The Little Mermaid
was created by Disney,

168
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,889
right before he created
Spider-Man and Star Wars.

169
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,624
This is the real little mermaid.

170
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,560
And she was
a very tragic figure.

171
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,628
- What about her buddy, the crab?
- There was no crab!

172
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,396
He was the only
funny thing in it.

173
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,565
Got that right.

174
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:19,399
Oh, my God, it's wonderful.

175
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,802
More people biking
than driving cars.

176
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,336
Yes, it's rush hour,

177
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,973
so people are taking
the bicycle superhighways home.

178
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,675
How crowded are
your bicycle superhighways?

179
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,176
Well...

180
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,678
We don't have any.

181
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,880
But how many people
ride bikes in your town?

182
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,582
The paperboy, till Dad hit him.

183
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,817
Sadly, the one headline
he couldn't deliver.

184
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,186
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
stop the car!

185
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,992
What? It's Danish for
speed check.

186
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,527
Fart kontrol.

187
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:52,600
I apologize for my husband.

188
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,835
In our language,
that sign means something else.

189
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,336
Yes, I know.

190
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,105
I'm speaking to you
in your language.

191
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,712
Non-Danes do not qualify
for the free health care.

192
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:07,214
But if you injure yourself
in Denmark,

193
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:10,618
a Danish hospital
will treat you for free.

194
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:14,354
I can't believe
the government puts this out.

195
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,789
For free!

196
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,860
Excuse me, you dropped this.

197
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:23,363
Lisa, this is Prince Christian,
second in line to the throne.

198
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,401
I play the tenor sax.

199
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,470
Oh, no, here it comes.

200
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,906
The fantasy about
becoming a princess

201
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,042
that no girl can resist.

202
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:04,004
Bart, get out of my fantasy!

203
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:07,040
Ah, geez, I saved your life.
How about a you're welcome?

204
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,944
Can you imagine
how exciting it would be

205
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,512
to live in this city?

206
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,948
Ooh, Mom, we could try it
for a semester.

207
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:18,285
Do you know how long I've wanted
to live in a Celsius country?

208
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,120
There's boobs on the billboards!

209
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:23,423
And we're here in the world's
most perfect amusement park.

210
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,602
Their national anthem
is so beautiful,

211
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,271
and they don't get to war
until the second verse.

212
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,942
And it's in a range
you can actually sing.

213
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:47,380
<i>There is a lovely land</i>

214
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:52,619
<i>With spreading shady
beech-trees</i>

215
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,656
<i>Near salty eastern shore</i>

216
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:03,396
<i>Near salty eastern shore</i>

217
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:09,669
Bart and Lisa are getting along!
This country is calling to us.

218
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:12,472
Homer, can you take
the daring step

219
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,674
of doing nothing
and staying here?

220
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,844
There are big reasons
why we can't live here.

221
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,412
I'm okay with nuclear power,
but wind power?

222
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:23,183
- Frankly, it sounds dangerous.
- Excuse me, white trash.

223
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,685
Is this the kind of country
you want to live in?

224
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:28,922
No, sir. I meant we separate
our trash by colors.

225
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:34,527
<i>This country is still lovely</i>

226
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:38,365
<i>Because blue is
the lake wind...</i>

227
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:41,835
I can't believe you're talking
about leaving Springfield.

228
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,037
That's where all my friends are.

229
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,610
Look, everyone, we came here
to rip this country off,

230
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,713
and that's what we're gonna do
and then go home.

231
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:57,017
Fine. Let's find a place
that has good smorrebrod,

232
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,354
or maybe some morbradbof
or flaeskesteg.

233
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,023
Women do love this country.

234
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,792
Homer, do you think
I'm handsome?

235
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:07,194
Well, yes.
I was gonna mention it.

236
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,363
- I am a Danish four.
- I'm an American nine.

237
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,568
How could my family
want to stay here?

238
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:19,472
In America, we have great
TV channels, like BBC America,

239
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:23,210
and a factory for cheesecakes,
a factory!

240
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,146
Your enthusiasm makes me
want to follow you there.

241
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,948
Foreigners are
no longer welcome.

242
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,551
All right, Dad,
no more fooling around.

243
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,554
Time to get you in the hospital,
so we can go home.

244
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,866
Hello. How was your day?

245
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,134
This country sure is safe.

246
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,536
Well, last week,
an older tourist

247
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,605
had a bad fall
at Kronborg Castle.

248
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,442
Of course, Kronborg Castle.
Why didn't I think of it?

249
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,778
Probably because
I never heard of it.

250
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,813
Dating back
to the 15th century,

251
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:36,549
Kronborg was immortalized
as Elsinore

252
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,151
in Shakespeare's Hamlet.

253
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:39,719
Isn't it beautiful?

254
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,489
Yeah, the castle's okay,
but the keep is, like, meh.

255
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,791
And I'll tell you something else
great about here.

256
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,460
You've been walking so much,
you've lost weight.

257
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,163
I'm down to
my pre-pregnancy weight!

258
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:53,133
Homer, in this most beautiful
spot on earth,

259
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:57,804
I have to admit to you,
I really don't want to go home.

260
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,907
- I don't either.
- Let's stay.

261
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,309
Think about how happy
we'd be here.

262
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:06,846
It's healthy, it's clean,
it's incredibly civilized,

263
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,682
and everything is done
in moderation.

264
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,818
You're not describing a country.

265
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,687
You're describing everything
that's the opposite of me.

266
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,689
Everyone here speaks
perfect English.

267
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,658
Probably gonna be around
in five years.

268
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,694
It's just a nice place
and we like it.

269
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:25,232
All I ask is that
you think about it.

270
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,371
Maybe she's right.
Maybe we should move here.

271
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,443
Tubby or not tubby,
that is the question.

272
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,178
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind

273
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,348
to gobble the wings and nachos
of outrageous portions,

274
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,383
or just eat fish and end them.

275
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:47,554
There's the rub,
brisket rub, Memphis rub.

276
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:52,025
Oh, the rubs I'll miss when
I have shuffled off from Buffalo.

277
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,860
Mozzarella... No.

278
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,696
I'm an American, and we've got
to get back to America,

279
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,567
the greatest country on earth,
1917 to 2016.

280
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,539
This is the famous Holger
Danish, our sleeping king.

281
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,041
All right, Dad, here we go.

282
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:10,910
There's nothing more American
than a slip and fall.

283
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,382
Hold on, son.

284
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,318
Before you push me down these
stairs, I have a confession.

285
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,988
The procedure I need
isn't a surgery.

286
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:23,923
I just need to remove
an old tattoo.

287
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:26,893
You made us come here
because of a stupid tattoo?

288
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,696
It's not just any tattoo.

289
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,433
Mom?

290
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:38,071
No! Mona Malloy,
who used to iron my shirts.

291
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:40,107
Of course it's your mother.

292
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:45,778
I can't go to my grave
with this hanging over my heart.

293
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,414
Why is it guys like us

294
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,916
are always disappointing
the women we love?

295
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,286
I would ask Mona, but she's
spending eternity hating me,

296
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,921
from her pit in hell.

297
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,623
I miss her too.

298
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:59,526
Her greatest skill was
making people miss her.

299
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,031
- Hello.
- She's talking to you.

300
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,766
I'll talk to someone my age.

301
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,104
Excuse me.
I felt compelled to meet you.

302
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:14,141
I've never met a man
with empathy so deep

303
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:15,808
he weeps in public.

304
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,944
Oh, yeah, I cry, I blubber.

305
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,979
Sometimes stuff
comes out of my nose.

306
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:21,981
Well...

307
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,784
Danish men never reveal
such emotion.

308
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,154
They're like
cold, flawless gods.

309
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,489
Look, lady, I'm a married man.

310
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,725
I'm a married man.

311
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,793
I'm a married man.

312
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,564
Here, marriage is not
such a sacred institution.

313
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,133
Danes are very free sexually.

314
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:44,337
Perhaps it's because we are more
sensitive to each other's needs,

315
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:46,806
or just because
we're all so freaking hot.

316
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,977
Now let us dance our
traditional dance of passion.

317
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,379
Okay.

318
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,827
Do you know the Danes eat more
ice cream than any other people?

319
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,862
Yet their rate
of heart disease is...

320
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,099
Oh, it's their number one
cause of death.

321
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,800
Well, look where we got it.

322
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,437
Well, that never
stopped your father.

323
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,540
I'll just text a picture of you
right now, eating the ice...

324
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:21,874
Oh, my God.

325
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,077
Marge.

326
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,380
Where are you going?

327
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:29,782
Where will I ever find
another man like you?

328
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:32,852
Hi, we're the Kiwanis Club
of Cheeseburg, Ohio.

329
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,389
Oh... hio.

330
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,058
I must confess to you now,

331
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:42,729
every couple that has Airbnb'd
my apartment has broken up.

332
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:45,132
Then how did it get
so many good reviews?

333
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,866
They like the big apartment cat.

334
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,802
Oh, I do like it.
Oh, let me scratch your chin!

335
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,206
He's so chubby,
I just can't take it!

336
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,074
Marge, honey, I'm so sorry.

337
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:57,577
We shared a dance and a fish,
but that's it.

338
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,580
- I understand. It's fine.
- So you're coming home?

339
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,316
No, I'm not. I want to stay.

340
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,053
I don't know for how long,
but I feel so alive and free.

341
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,721
I've stopped wearing a bra.

342
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,324
That means
they're just one fabric away

343
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:13,260
from the cool Scandinavian air.

344
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,895
Sorry, Homie. We're not leaving.

345
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,765
Well, the kids
can't just replace me.

346
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,068
He's so cozy.
He can sleep with Mom.

347
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,103
Can I get you a beer?

348
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,112
Dad, wait.

349
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:36,283
Mom says you can take these home
with you. It's a bag of bras.

350
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:40,052
And I just learned
how to unhook these.

351
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,590
Oh, my God. What am I doing?

352
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,592
I should be having
the time of my life

353
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,928
in this airport security line,
but it's nothing without Marge.

354
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,963
Son, I got
to tell you something.

355
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:53,266
- You're making a huge mistake.
- I know.

356
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,435
I let stubbornness
ruin my marriage,

357
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,605
and all I have to show for it
is an old tattoo.

358
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,708
- Go back to your woman.
- You mean the one in the bar?

359
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,976
First the one in the bar,
then Marge.

360
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,612
No! Just Marge.

361
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,055
- Marge!
- You missed the flight.

362
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,791
Marge, baby,
wherever you are is home.

363
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,393
I'm staying in Copenhagen.

364
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:22,061
I'm glad you came back,

365
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:25,465
but I was kind of rethinking
living here.

366
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,133
Why?

367
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,068
The toilet's in the shower.

368
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,670
The washing machine
won't even hold

369
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,339
one pair of your underpants.

370
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:38,177
And you see how dark it is?

371
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:40,280
It's 11:00 in the morning.

372
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:47,019
Well, that was a nice day.

373
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,422
I think I'm ready to go home.

374
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,857
You got it, baby.

375
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,825
We'll ditch this paradise
and never come back.

376
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,160
What about the kids?

377
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,563
I heard the schools are
really great here. I'm out.

378
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:59,399
I want to stay,
but no one ever listens to me.

379
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,033
So we're all united.

380
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,669
All right!

381
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:06,038
But I can't help thinking
I'm forgetting something.

382
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,943
Sir, those birds were
already fed by the state.

383
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:14,046
You are overfeeding them,
which will kill them.

384
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,457
When life gives you lemons,
you make lemonade.

385
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,028
So how much do we owe you?

386
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,031
Nothing. In Denmark,
we have socialized tattooing.

387
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,602
And with that, our country
is out of money. Good-bye.
