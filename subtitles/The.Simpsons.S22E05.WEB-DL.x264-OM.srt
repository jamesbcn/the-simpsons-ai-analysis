3
00:00:33,915 --> 00:00:35,132
Hey!

4
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:51,465
Mousey and Catsy,
aren't they great?

5
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:53,417
Now listen up, kids.

6
00:00:53,485 --> 00:00:56,720
Krusty's sponsor, the Texxon
family of gas stations,

7
00:00:56,788 --> 00:00:59,690
wants you to know
that today's the last day

8
00:00:59,758 --> 00:01:03,127
of their "Happy Little Elves"
giveaway!

9
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:05,029
It's Texxon's way of saying,

10
00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:07,998
"Sorry about
those million dead pelicans."

11
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:13,604
You'll really love
the intentionally scarce

12
00:01:13,672 --> 00:01:15,506
"Baby Must-Have."

13
00:01:17,225 --> 00:01:20,361
Don't you want her
beyond all reason?

14
00:01:21,763 --> 00:01:23,998
Maggie, you can't
climb into the TV.

15
00:01:24,065 --> 00:01:28,619
If you could, I'd make Alex
Trebek answer some questions.

16
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:30,504
Dad, I think
Maggie's just sad

17
00:01:30,572 --> 00:01:33,607
'cause her set is missing
"Baby Must-Have."

18
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:37,261
No child of mine will go
without anything, ever!

19
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:40,114
Except quality health care!

20
00:01:40,181 --> 00:01:43,434
Didn't there used
to be more Texxon stations?

21
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:47,304
Yes, but they sold a bunch off
to that frozen yogurt chain.

22
00:01:51,025 --> 00:01:53,727
What a cheap
date this is.

23
00:01:53,795 --> 00:01:56,330
I'm not cheap, baby, I'm
embarrassed to be seen with you.

24
00:01:56,398 --> 00:01:57,798
Big difference.
Hmm...

25
00:02:03,054 --> 00:02:04,805
Hmm. Nice part of
town you got here.

26
00:02:04,873 --> 00:02:06,824
Too bad you keep
it so far away.

27
00:02:08,393 --> 00:02:10,294
Now that we're best friends,
can I get the baby elf?

28
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:11,512
Pick a box.

29
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:12,946
You get what you get.

30
00:02:13,014 --> 00:02:14,715
You can't tell
what's inside!

31
00:02:14,783 --> 00:02:17,584
Oh, of all the times not
to have x-ray vision.

32
00:02:17,652 --> 00:02:20,487
Mm... I'll take that one.

33
00:02:23,608 --> 00:02:26,009
Hmm?

34
00:02:26,077 --> 00:02:28,746
This isn't the right one.
She wants the baby.

35
00:02:28,813 --> 00:02:30,614
I can't give you another toy

36
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:33,150
till you buy another
ten gallons of gas.

37
00:02:33,218 --> 00:02:35,352
You're lucky you're
behind glass.

38
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,621
Ain't no glass.

39
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:39,690
Sure, it's easy
to slap people

40
00:02:39,758 --> 00:02:40,791
when you're hiding
behind that glass!

41
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,544
You have a good day.

42
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:45,912
Drive all the way,
get the wrong elf.

43
00:02:45,964 --> 00:02:47,331
Ain't no glass.

44
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,766
I'll show them.

45
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,869
I'll buy ten more gallons
of their stupid gas.

46
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:56,757
Whoo-hoo!

47
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:06,984
D'oh!

48
00:03:12,507 --> 00:03:13,373
D'oh!

49
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:19,012
D'oh!

50
00:03:22,183 --> 00:03:23,283
D'oh!

51
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,858
D'oh!

52
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,101
D'oh!

53
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:43,987
Oh, Homie, maybe we
should call it a day.

54
00:03:44,055 --> 00:03:47,024
Oh, I'm sorry, Maggie,
but even at your age,

55
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:50,277
I'm sure you understand
things can't always go your way,

56
00:03:50,328 --> 00:03:54,615
and that's why I can't believe
we didn't get that stupid elf!

57
00:03:59,254 --> 00:04:00,788
Where the hell are we?

58
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:03,891
I've never seen stores
like these before.

59
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,794
I know where we are!

60
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:08,879
This is the neighborhood
where I grew up!

61
00:04:08,963 --> 00:04:11,431
Ooh, everything's changed.

62
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:13,767
That tree used to be
a smaller tree.

63
00:04:13,835 --> 00:04:17,137
And that food bank used
to be a regular bank.

64
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:19,506
The march of progress.

65
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:21,842
There's my old house!

66
00:04:23,862 --> 00:04:26,196
Someday when I'm a grownup,
maybe I'll go back

67
00:04:26,264 --> 00:04:27,798
and look fondly
at our house.

68
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:30,701
Well, stop in and say "hi" to me
'cause I'll still be there,

69
00:04:30,768 --> 00:04:33,437
chillin' in my
basement bachelor pad.

70
00:04:33,505 --> 00:04:36,240
Be sure to water the flowers
on my backyard grave.

71
00:04:36,307 --> 00:04:37,641
As long as I can dig you up

72
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:39,776
and stick you on the front porch
every Halloween.

73
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:41,962
Just don't dress me up like a woman.
We'll see.

74
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:46,099
I know what you folks
are here for.

75
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:47,601
Rabbits!

76
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:49,670
I just killed this one
because it stopped bein' cute!

77
00:04:49,737 --> 00:04:51,638
We're not here
for rabbit.

78
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:54,174
I used to live in
this house as a girl.

79
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:56,043
I live in it now as a woman.

80
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,878
Hey, you wanna come on in?
Take a look around?

81
00:04:57,946 --> 00:05:00,647
Oh, I'd love to,
if it's not an imposition.

82
00:05:00,715 --> 00:05:03,016
Well, as long as we don't
have to feed this one.

83
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,820
Tell her "no deal."

84
00:05:09,057 --> 00:05:11,024
Everything's just
the way I remember it.

85
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:12,359
You see that mirror?

86
00:05:12,427 --> 00:05:14,528
I discovered that if I sat
in the kitchen,

87
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:16,396
I could see
if the bathroom was free

88
00:05:16,464 --> 00:05:19,366
using the reflection
from the mirror off the toaster.

89
00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:27,140
This was my bedroom.

90
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,742
My bedpost smooshes

91
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,177
are still in the carpet!

92
00:05:31,512 --> 00:05:32,713
I want to go read books
in the car.

93
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,481
There are no books
in the car.

94
00:05:34,549 --> 00:05:36,617
I just want to
sit in the car!

95
00:05:36,684 --> 00:05:39,102
I always wondered
who "Marge" is.

96
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:42,005
My memorables!

97
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:43,941
Over the years, I've
sure been tempted

98
00:05:44,008 --> 00:05:45,309
to go through
this stuff.

99
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:47,311
So I did, many times.

100
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,881
My whole childhood
is in this box.

101
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:53,684
My scrunchies.

102
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:56,753
I never really had
the hair for these.

103
00:05:56,821 --> 00:05:58,288
Wow, Mom.

104
00:05:58,356 --> 00:06:00,757
You got first place
in the science fair.

105
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:02,392
Oh, that's
ancient history.

106
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,295
Ooh, here's my paper
on ancient history.

107
00:06:06,631 --> 00:06:09,616
Mom, these grades are amazing.

108
00:06:09,684 --> 00:06:11,501
Just as good as mine.

109
00:06:11,586 --> 00:06:14,237
<i>But then you wound up like you.</i>

110
00:06:21,262 --> 00:06:22,996
Oh, man.

111
00:06:23,064 --> 00:06:25,332
The drainage
around here is a joke.

112
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,534
I don't even know
why I pay taxes.

113
00:06:27,602 --> 00:06:28,669
Coming through!

114
00:06:31,305 --> 00:06:33,640
Just when you think
I'm out of ideas!

115
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:38,195
Whoop! Ahh!

116
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:41,398
♪ Feeling the grind,
up go the hammers ♪

117
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:48,288
Mm-hmm.

118
00:06:49,424 --> 00:06:51,892
Get your affairs in order.

119
00:06:55,863 --> 00:06:57,714
Bart beat up
Nelson.

120
00:06:57,782 --> 00:06:59,800
A new bully has risen.

121
00:06:59,851 --> 00:07:01,768
Simpson! Boombaye!

122
00:07:01,836 --> 00:07:03,687
Simpson! Boombaye!

123
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:10,077
Oh! Mama!

124
00:07:17,118 --> 00:07:19,987
Buying those extra trophies
from cash-strapped schools

125
00:07:20,054 --> 00:07:21,555
really filled out the old case.

126
00:07:21,622 --> 00:07:23,557
Principal Skinner?
Quick question.

127
00:07:23,624 --> 00:07:26,093
Is it true my mom
was a great student?

128
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,862
Oh, indeed. Your mother was
as fine a student as you.

129
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,097
Keep up the good work,

130
00:07:30,164 --> 00:07:31,832
and you'll probably
wind up just like her.

131
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:34,167
Well...

132
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:36,470
Of course that would be great.

133
00:07:36,537 --> 00:07:40,340
But I see myself making
an impact outside the home.

134
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:43,176
Lisa, one of the
hardest jobs I have

135
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:45,645
is throwing cold water on
young children's dreams.

136
00:07:45,713 --> 00:07:47,481
Ralph, you're not a kangaroo.

137
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,852
The point is, I've learned
a lot about human nature

138
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,220
by sitting in the
park with Mother.

139
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:54,788
And one thing I've learned

140
00:07:54,856 --> 00:07:56,890
is children turn out
like their parents.

141
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:00,844
Behold, your future.

142
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:02,579
Oh...

143
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:06,349
Ralph, you're also
not a trophy.

144
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:09,453
Skinner!

145
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,955
I warned you about
interacting with students.

146
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:13,790
I don't want to have
to yell at you!

147
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:15,325
You yell at me
about everything.

148
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:16,927
Well I can't yell
at anyone else!

149
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:19,763
Teachers have a union.
Students have parents.

150
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:21,631
What about Willie?
I like Willie!

151
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,049
Maggie, something
happened to Mom,

152
00:08:28,171 --> 00:08:30,222
and I'm gonna find out
what and when.

153
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:32,891
Mom's looking good through
elementary school.

154
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,495
Ninth grade, tenth grade,
still riding the A-Train.

155
00:08:36,562 --> 00:08:39,631
Then suddenly, when she was
a high school senior...

156
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:41,366
Blam!

157
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:43,235
You kids play nice up there!

158
00:08:43,302 --> 00:08:45,170
What could have happened?

159
00:09:05,424 --> 00:09:06,625
Dad?
Hmm?

160
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:07,826
Can I talk to
you for a second?

161
00:09:07,894 --> 00:09:09,728
What is troubling you,
my son?

162
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:12,531
I mean, my girl son?

163
00:09:12,598 --> 00:09:15,767
Well, um, I was looking
through Mom's old schoolwork,

164
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:18,570
and I noticed her
grades went down

165
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:20,472
when she started
going out with you.

166
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,240
Hey, if it hadn't been me,

167
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:24,176
it would have been
someone or something else.

168
00:09:24,243 --> 00:09:26,945
Sooner or later,
everyone meets their Homer.

169
00:09:29,932 --> 00:09:31,733
No offense, Dad,

170
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:34,936
but no boy is gonna
distract me from my dreams.

171
00:09:35,004 --> 00:09:37,672
It may not be a boy.
It could be anything:

172
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,276
scrapbooking, high-stakes poker,
or the Santa Fe lifestyle.

173
00:09:41,344 --> 00:09:44,646
Just pick a dead end
and chill out till you die.

174
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:47,148
No! That's not
gonna happen to me!

175
00:09:47,216 --> 00:09:50,585
I'm gonna make sure
nothing distracts me ever!

176
00:09:51,854 --> 00:09:53,705
Whoa!
Look at you,

177
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:56,625
strutting around, like
you're Toad of Toad Hall.

178
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:58,693
Uh, I'm just whistling, man.

179
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:03,365
You think you're so smart,
don't you, Simpson?

180
00:10:03,432 --> 00:10:05,333
We're both in
the same reading group.

181
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:07,202
I think you know
how smart I am.

182
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,338
That's an insult to me
and the rest of the inchworms.

183
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:14,359
Bart did it again!

184
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:15,710
I'm not a bully!

185
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:18,964
It's just a series
of incredible coincidences.

186
00:10:19,015 --> 00:10:21,383
Well, Bart, I guess his
parking spot is yours now.

187
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,784
Well done.

188
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:28,023
Okay, I've gotten rid

189
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,358
of all of my distractions,
diversions,

190
00:10:30,426 --> 00:10:31,860
hobbies...

191
00:10:31,928 --> 00:10:33,161
Oh, my God!

192
00:10:33,229 --> 00:10:36,598
Are you a distraction
or a higher calling?

193
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,966
All right, let's see.

194
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:41,386
How many jazz musicians
led long and happy lives?

195
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:43,305
There's, um...

196
00:10:52,732 --> 00:10:55,717
That's odd. Lisa just threw
her saxophone out the window.

197
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:57,903
Oh, that's probably
because to her,

198
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,171
the saxophone is a me,

199
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:01,940
and she doesn't want
to end up like you.

200
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:03,608
Good night.

201
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:05,777
She doesn't want
to end up like me?

202
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:08,747
Uh, no, she <i>does,</i>
totally, but, uh,

203
00:11:08,814 --> 00:11:10,932
with a happier
ending. Good night.

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,968
What's so wrong
with <i>me?</i>

205
00:11:13,035 --> 00:11:14,686
Nothing,
sweetie, nothing.

206
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:16,404
Here, let me explain.

207
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:18,657
She does not want to...

208
00:11:18,724 --> 00:11:20,792
turn out like... you...

209
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,094
didn't... not until...

210
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:25,430
diplomatic... trapped...

211
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:26,748
help.

212
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:28,667
Remember nothing!

213
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:31,569
I remember everything.

214
00:11:31,637 --> 00:11:34,906
Well, if you check your purse,
I think you'll find...

215
00:11:34,974 --> 00:11:37,492
the seven of clubs!

216
00:11:39,595 --> 00:11:41,012
No.

217
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,050
Just a picture of Lisa--
who wants to be nothing like me.

218
00:11:45,117 --> 00:11:47,152
I am so sorry, Marge.

219
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:49,821
Hee-hee-hee.

220
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:50,855
<i>Stupid pan!</i>

221
00:11:53,392 --> 00:11:55,493
Mom, could you keep
it down a little?

222
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:57,295
I'm trying to study.
Uh-huh. Yeah.

223
00:11:57,363 --> 00:11:59,297
Here's your breakfast.

224
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:01,766
Not a good time!

225
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:03,935
Mom, is
something wrong?

226
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:06,938
Would it be so bad
to turn out like me?!

227
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:09,741
Mom, I admire everything you do.

228
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:11,576
But it's not good
enough, is it?

229
00:12:11,644 --> 00:12:13,411
It's plenty good.
It's great!

230
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:14,679
It's just...

231
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:16,414
not for me.

232
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:20,251
School bus!

233
00:12:22,855 --> 00:12:24,823
Mmm...

234
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,894
What kind of kiss did <i>you</i> get?
Normal. You?

235
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:30,996
Ice-cold.

236
00:12:31,063 --> 00:12:32,564
You're just
imagining things.

237
00:12:32,631 --> 00:12:34,499
Oh, yeah?

238
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:35,800
Hmm...

239
00:12:35,868 --> 00:12:38,019
What does your note say?

240
00:12:38,087 --> 00:12:40,155
The seven of clubs?

241
00:12:40,222 --> 00:12:41,423
Ta-dah!

242
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,810
Ugh! What's the point
of getting rid of all

243
00:12:48,878 --> 00:12:51,513
the distractions at home if
I have to do my learning here?

244
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,638
♪ Oh, I'll wax the upstairs ♪

245
00:13:00,723 --> 00:13:02,557
♪ And I'll wax the downstairs ♪

246
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:05,760
♪ And I'll get drunk
in the li'bry! ♪

247
00:13:05,811 --> 00:13:06,978
Willie!

248
00:13:07,046 --> 00:13:09,380
Do you have to wax
this floor now?

249
00:13:09,448 --> 00:13:11,249
No, no, I can
come back later.

250
00:13:11,317 --> 00:13:12,600
Whoa-aah! Oof!

251
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:15,687
Oh. Should I get the nurse?

252
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,155
Nay, just keep studyin'.

253
00:13:17,223 --> 00:13:18,756
I'll scream this out.

254
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,248
Aah!

255
00:13:29,985 --> 00:13:32,503
I can get to you
whenever I want, Simpson.

256
00:13:32,571 --> 00:13:34,572
But I'm gonna bide my time.

257
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,775
You won't even hear
the punch that wastes you.

258
00:13:37,843 --> 00:13:40,912
And you'll crack like
one of those chicken turds

259
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,780
rich people eat.

260
00:13:42,848 --> 00:13:44,515
You mean an egg?

261
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,701
I mean you're dead!

262
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:47,919
Aah!

263
00:13:47,987 --> 00:13:49,287
Let me out of here,

264
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:51,089
so I can put <i>you</i> in here!

265
00:13:51,156 --> 00:13:53,458
Ha! You're not
so tough <i>now.</i>

266
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,834
Aw... Dad was right--

267
00:14:02,918 --> 00:14:04,619
I might as well give up.

268
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,669
Cloisters Academy?

269
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:25,273
That bus could pick me up
any day of the week!

270
00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:26,274
'Sup, bro?

271
00:14:26,342 --> 00:14:28,293
I'm not your brother.

272
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:32,897
Lord Buddha, I know
I'm not supposed to want stuff,

273
00:14:32,965 --> 00:14:34,899
but come on!

274
00:14:41,106 --> 00:14:44,108
Cloisters Academy is a
refuge for quiet learning.

275
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:46,210
We have every
facility imaginable,

276
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:48,012
including an imaginatorium.

277
00:14:48,981 --> 00:14:51,416
Oh, no, wait, it's over there.

278
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,584
Mom! Dad! Please
can I go here?

279
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:57,005
I'll study so hard, I'll make
the old me look like Bart!

280
00:14:57,072 --> 00:14:59,107
That would be one
<i>weird-looking</i> kid.

281
00:14:59,174 --> 00:15:01,342
We'd love to send
you here, sweetie.

282
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,277
We just can't afford it.

283
00:15:03,345 --> 00:15:05,096
Well, I'm sure
Lisa will be fine

284
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:06,631
at Springfield Elementary.

285
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:09,567
I hear they just found out
there was a World War <i>II.</i>

286
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,170
Oh...

287
00:15:12,237 --> 00:15:14,672
Homer, Lisa, could you
please step outside?

288
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,775
I have a few choice words
for this gentleman.

289
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:20,361
Mom... please don't.

290
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:21,763
Oh, I've seen
that look before.

291
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,998
That's the "I ate
the piece of wedding cake

292
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:26,267
she's been saving
in the freezer ten years" look.

293
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:28,236
You what?!
Run!

294
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,738
Lisa, your mother
convinced me

295
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:49,006
to take a closer look
at your record,

296
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:52,310
and upon further reflection,
I have decided to offer you

297
00:15:52,378 --> 00:15:54,812
a full scholarship
to Cloisters Academy.

298
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,397
I have a future!

299
00:15:56,465 --> 00:15:58,516
Oh! Thank you, Mom!

300
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:01,219
Oh, thank you,
four-eyes!

301
00:16:02,688 --> 00:16:05,089
So, you'll start Monday.

302
00:16:05,157 --> 00:16:06,691
I'm so exci...

303
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,092
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Quiet campus.

304
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,293
Shh.

305
00:16:09,361 --> 00:16:10,795
Now, please, hold
your celebration

306
00:16:10,863 --> 00:16:12,580
until you're off
the school grounds.

307
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:22,707
What time Monday?

308
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:24,542
Um, 8:00.
Thank you.

309
00:16:38,806 --> 00:16:40,056
An academy.

310
00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:42,160
I'm attending an academy.

311
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:45,013
Hi. I see that you're new,

312
00:16:45,097 --> 00:16:47,766
and we'd be honored to have
you join our softball team.

313
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,734
I'm sorry, I don't really play.

314
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:50,935
Oh, no one plays.

315
00:16:51,003 --> 00:16:53,154
We just discuss
the physics of the game.

316
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:56,608
I lead the team in E.R.A.:
Extremely Right Answers.

317
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:58,476
Count me in!

318
00:16:58,527 --> 00:17:00,845
What's wrong, sweetie?
You seem upset.

319
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:02,947
I don't want to talk about it.

320
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,467
Oh...

321
00:17:05,534 --> 00:17:07,369
A kid at school's
gonna beat me up.

322
00:17:07,453 --> 00:17:08,570
Is it Milhouse?

323
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,405
Milhouse couldn't beat me up.

324
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:12,741
Are you sure?
He's having a growth spurt.

325
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:14,359
It's not Milhouse!

326
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,494
Is it a girl?
It's Nelson!

327
00:17:16,545 --> 00:17:19,080
Hm! I never figured him
for the bully type.

328
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:20,548
Well, if he's got
you cornered,

329
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:22,167
and Milhouse isn't
there to help you,

330
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:24,219
there's only one way out--

331
00:17:24,286 --> 00:17:26,654
Make him feel good
about himself!

332
00:17:26,722 --> 00:17:27,822
How do I do that?

333
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,890
I don't know.

334
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,658
Compliment his glasses.

335
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:32,961
It's not Milhouse!

336
00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:38,516
Hi, Lisa.

337
00:17:38,584 --> 00:17:40,785
I'm Ms. Marshall,
and I'm your teacher.

338
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:43,355
Well, I am so happy
to be in your class.

339
00:17:43,422 --> 00:17:45,023
No, I'm <i>your</i> teacher.

340
00:17:45,091 --> 00:17:46,558
I only teach <i>you.</i>

341
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,194
Your short story about
the lonely pony-- gripping.

342
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:51,730
Did you get that the pony
was actually me?

343
00:17:51,797 --> 00:17:53,264
It hit me the next day,

344
00:17:53,332 --> 00:17:54,933
and I read the
whole thing again.

345
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,534
I thought we'd
start the semester

346
00:17:56,602 --> 00:17:58,303
by turning this
into a novel.

347
00:17:58,371 --> 00:17:59,437
Self-published?

348
00:17:59,505 --> 00:18:00,872
Real published.

349
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,407
Oh...

350
00:18:16,322 --> 00:18:19,224
Ha... ha...!

351
00:18:27,516 --> 00:18:28,783
This is it, Simpson!

352
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:31,453
After this, your nose
will not be an outtie.

353
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,556
Make him feel
good about himself!

354
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,874
Uh, Nelson,

355
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:38,042
for someone who never
goes to the dentist,

356
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,744
you have pretty
good teeth.

357
00:18:39,812 --> 00:18:41,079
They're dentures!

358
00:18:41,147 --> 00:18:43,081
Uh, you do a lot

359
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:44,549
with a limited wardrobe.

360
00:18:44,616 --> 00:18:47,652
That's social worker talk
for "I'm poor"!

361
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,003
Uh, uh,

362
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:50,522
you punch really good!

363
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:52,507
You think?

364
00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:53,908
Oh, yeah!

365
00:18:53,976 --> 00:18:56,478
And you always avoid the
face around picture day.

366
00:18:56,545 --> 00:18:58,496
People appreciate that.

367
00:18:58,564 --> 00:19:00,832
Hey, those memories are forever.

368
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,534
You really care, man.

369
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:04,635
A lot of bullies
just phone it in.

370
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:06,204
Kearney.

371
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,657
That school is so great!

372
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:11,693
Teachers teach so much better

373
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,628
when they're paid in money,
not chickens.

374
00:19:13,696 --> 00:19:15,964
Is Mom gonna come up
and say good night?

375
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,156
Your mom's doing laundry,

376
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,211
but she authorized me
to say goodnight for her.

377
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:21,700
So, by the power invested in me

378
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,635
I now pronounce
you sweet dreams.

379
00:19:35,313 --> 00:19:36,480
Mom?

380
00:19:46,107 --> 00:19:47,608
Here we go.

381
00:19:47,676 --> 00:19:49,577
Clean and white...

382
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:52,646
...and soft...

383
00:19:54,015 --> 00:19:55,933
Mom?

384
00:19:56,001 --> 00:19:57,384
I see what happened.

385
00:19:57,435 --> 00:19:59,036
There <i>was</i> no scholarship.

386
00:19:59,104 --> 00:20:01,922
They said I could attend
if you did all their laundry!

387
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,591
I can't live with that knowledge

388
00:20:03,658 --> 00:20:05,292
while trying
to get more knowledge.

389
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,528
Lisa, honey,
I insist.

390
00:20:07,596 --> 00:20:11,365
Because it's important to you
that you don't turn out like me.

391
00:20:13,134 --> 00:20:15,636
Mom, I don't want
to go to that school.

392
00:20:15,704 --> 00:20:16,870
Why not?

393
00:20:16,938 --> 00:20:20,140
Because it's too elitist.

394
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,776
Everyone's parents
are in "the business."

395
00:20:22,844 --> 00:20:24,011
What business?

396
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,879
I don't know.
They won't tell me.

397
00:20:25,947 --> 00:20:28,182
And besides, you were
willing to do all this

398
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,584
just so I would be happy.

399
00:20:30,652 --> 00:20:33,854
Mom, I'd be honored
if I turned out like you.

400
00:20:38,226 --> 00:20:40,144
Mom, thanks to you,

401
00:20:40,228 --> 00:20:42,997
this box sucker
didn't beat me up.

402
00:20:43,064 --> 00:20:45,399
We've been pokin'
foil all night.

403
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:48,535
Must've put away
two eight-packs by now.

404
00:20:48,603 --> 00:20:50,938
I'm so glad you two
are friends again.

405
00:20:51,006 --> 00:20:52,823
Look what Maggie got!

406
00:20:52,891 --> 00:20:54,858
Homer? How did you get...
Ah.

407
00:20:54,926 --> 00:20:57,261
A father has his secrets.

408
00:20:57,329 --> 00:21:00,097
How did he get in?
Told you, ain't got no glass.

409
00:21:00,165 --> 00:21:02,132
Did he take any money?
Uh-uh.

410
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,034
Well, he did now.

411
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,227
Shh!
