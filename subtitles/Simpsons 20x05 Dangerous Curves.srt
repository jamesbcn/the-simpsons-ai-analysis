1
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,071
D'oh!

2
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,858
BILL: Bill and Marty here
in the middle of another...

3
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,962
...4th of July Weekend
Shock Jock Talk Block.

4
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,563
All weekend long, we'll
be counting down...

5
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:06,933
...the top 500 wacky sound effects
of all time.

6
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:10,837
MARTY: And here's number 499.
Where were you when you first heard this?

7
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,407
I'll tell you where I
was. I was out eating...

8
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:19,079
I think I had Kung Pao...
And I ended up on the...

9
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,749
I can't listen to this anymore.

10
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,997
Nobody shuts out my blather!

11
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,721
Uh-oh.

12
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:36,429
Homie, let's pick up those hitchhikers.
They don't look like the stabby kind.

13
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,899
Mom, you said all hitchhikers
were drug-crazed thrill seekers.

14
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:43,689
I said they were
thrill-crazed drug seekers.

15
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:46,169
Don't put words in my mouth.

16
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,773
Thanks for stopping.

17
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:52,277
This is my girlfriend Beatrice.

18
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,151
Young love.

19
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:03,449
Were we ever that stupid?
- Of course we were.

20
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:11,164
Marge, I thought of a new thing.
It's called biking out.

21
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,566
It's a combination
of biking and making out.

22
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,801
I don't know.

23
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:18,641
Come on.
All the teens on bikes are doing it.

24
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,750
Howdy-do, strangers?

25
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,319
Hop on in before you become
a couple runneth over.

26
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,989
Ned, are you sure?
They're covered with mud.

27
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:39,959
And in that mud,
I'm planting the seed of friendship.

28
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,194
Name's Ned Flanders.

29
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,030
As the elephant said to the peanut vendor,
toss those in my trunk.

30
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,462
Marge, I love this guy.

31
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:51,156
Put her there, muddy buddy.
- He rhymes! Oh, happy day.

32
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,774
So are you two engaged,
engaged to be engaged?

33
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,043
No. We thought we'd wait a little while.

34
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:00,980
Really? Not married?
And you were bicycling two abreast?

35
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,550
I wish. We were bicycling to a lake.

36
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,052
Word play. Never cared for it.

37
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:09,689
But it's never too soon for you two
to join the 'I do' crew.

38
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,125
Now I'm not saying
it's all Jell-O with Cool Whip.

39
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,993
She'll nag you. She'll try to change you.

40
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:17,630
You'll be fighting the same basic fight
for years and years and years...

41
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,433
Ned, don't you think
you're exaggerating just a bit?

42
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,731
I think I'd like to finish my sentence.
And years.

43
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:26,106
Um...

44
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,874
How long have you two been married?

45
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,944
Since 2:00 this afternoon.
Welcome to our honeymoon.

46
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:36,181
Marge Bouvier, will you not marry me?

47
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,587
Homer Simpson,
I would be delighted not to marry you.

48
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,747
Then I now pronounce us just dating.

49
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:50,673
I love kissing you.
I never want to knock it off.

50
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,232
Knock it off!

51
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,968
How dare you expose my children
to your tender feelings?

52
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,337
Bart, don't you dare
take your eyes off that Gameboy!

53
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,437
Yes, sir.

54
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,073
Avast, you...

55
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,482
I'm cuckoo for killing stuff!

56
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:15,447
Video games, the reason this generation
of Americans is the best ever.

57
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,365
I can't believe
Homer ruined another family picnic.

58
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:30,170
Hey! Everybody pees in the pool.
- Not from the diving board.

59
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,306
Why do we have to have
these two jerks along? I can't...

60
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,543
You're driving too fast.
- You're losing your hair.

61
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,879
You sneeze like a girl.
- Your neck looks like a sideways ass.

62
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,979
HOMER: That's it!

63
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,815
Eat gravel, hags!

64
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:49,122
Homer, that was rude and shortsighted.
Patty and Selma have the map.

65
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:53,393
I have the situation under control.
The compass needle is pointing east.

66
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,493
That's the fuel gauge.

67
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,363
HOMER: Uh-oh.

68
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,033
How many times
do I have to say I'm sorry?

69
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,834
You haven't said you're sorry.

70
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:05,759
I know.
I was hoping the number might be zero.

71
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,580
Can we use your phone?
- Of course.

72
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,549
It's just past the sushi bar,
behind the limbo pit,

73
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,351
right in front of the blackjack table.

74
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:21,221
And feel free to stay.
We just put out the cheese.

75
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:26,859
We have cubes of yellow, cubes of orange
and cubes of orange and yellow.

76
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,697
A really fun party full of colored cheeses
and awesome stuff to do?

77
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,533
Doesn't seem like
your kind of thing, Marge.

78
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,201
We'll stay for one hand
roll or two nigiri.

79
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:38,504
Then we have to get back to the kids.

80
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:41,834
Let my dad enjoy them a little longer.

81
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,905
Stop! Stop!

82
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,550
Where are the cookies?
- I don't remember!

83
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,650
Wrong answer!

84
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,463
Oh.

85
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,698
For me?
- No. Get two of your own.

86
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,198
You're a funny one.

87
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,371
That's strong.
Are you trying to get me drunk?

88
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,673
No. I'm trying to get me drunk.

89
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:17,610
You know, my horoscope said
I'd meet the man of my dreams tonight.

90
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,381
Well, a horoscope would never lie
to a pretty girl like you.

91
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,882
You are adorable. Are you alone?

92
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,178
No. I'm talking to you
at this great party.

93
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:29,055
Well, then would you like to limbo?

94
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:32,759
Limbo? You mean the dance
or that place where unbaptized babies go?

95
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,859
Either way, I'm in.

96
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,192
Every limbo boy and girl...

97
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,903
...AII around the something world

98
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,563
Gonna do the limbo rock

99
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,971
Something something limbo something

100
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:54,877
Limbo low now. How low can you go?

101
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,350
That's how low you can go!

102
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,585
Why are you dancing
with that strange woman?

103
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,654
She's not strange. She's fun!

104
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,857
And she doesn't get jealous
when I talk to other women.

105
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:08,612
Well, then she can have
you all to herself!

106
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,541
How about a sushi fight?

107
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,837
Sushi fight!

108
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,654
These fish died for nothing!

109
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:30,446
Homer Simpson, I wish I'd never met you.

110
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,091
Thanks for the lift.

111
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:43,206
What a cute couple.
She's gonna take him for a lot of money.

112
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,098
Here we are.

113
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:54,440
A log cabin? What am I? Davy Crockett?
Also, who's Davy Crockett?

114
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,478
Kids, this place has very special memories
for your mother and me.

115
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,080
Well, leaving right now
will become a special memory for me.

116
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,645
They have a pedal car.

117
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,421
Pedal cars suck.
- They're worse than walking.

118
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,791
I'll put 100 bucks in your college fund.

119
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,052
I'll take 10 bucks now.

120
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,560
I'll steal it back when you're sleeping.

121
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,308
Well, when the sun goes down,

122
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:33,346
it means God's gone to China
to watch over those good folks.

123
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,446
Time for some shuteye.

124
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,008
Why, Flanders, you rogue.

125
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:42,989
All Marge and I need are a queen-size bed
and a king-size 'Do Not Disturb' sign.

126
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,259
Sorry, Homer.

127
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,529
I'm afraid it's separate accommodations
for you notly-weds.

128
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:54,167
What? But I have urges.
- That's just your trouser devil talking.

129
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,902
He's not talking. He's yelling.

130
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
Goodnight, Marge.

131
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,185
Sweet dreams, my new best friend.

132
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,324
What better way to celebrate
our wedding night...

133
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:22,164
...than by keeping
an unmarried couple apart.

134
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:24,897
Oh, Maude,

135
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:30,267
your dead grandmother's pajamas.
You know what that does to me.

136
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,875
I never thought I'd say this,
but stupid Flanders.

137
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,450
There's absolutely nothing to worry about.

138
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,721
I'm in my own room
being chaperoned by an actual Christian.

139
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,123
Well, I just don't trust
that Homer Simpson.

140
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:55,328
He's that rare combination
of up to something and good for nothing.

141
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,014
Good one. We should put that in the file.

142
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,668
Nice.

143
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:23,641
Madame, perhaps
I can be of some assistance.

144
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:28,494
But I can't take a dress from a man
who looks so good and smells so clean.

145
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,563
Please.
When you came to the door tonight,

146
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:34,500
I instantly imagined you in a ruched
burgundy bias-cut evening gown...

147
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,021
...with a wolverine hem...

148
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:38,504
...and a contrasting
cerise tulle décolletage.

149
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,970
Really? Me? You did?

150
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:45,278
Oh, yes. With a pair of saffron brocade
diamond mink pumps.

151
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:50,247
Oh! Pumps are shoes. That explains a lot.

152
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,817
Mmm-hmm.

153
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:58,791
Marjorie, you look beautiful.
Let me take you for a ride.

154
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,155
Or should I say glide?

155
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:07,799
I'm just happy you're talking again.
You didn't say a word for 45 minutes.

156
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,343
Marge?
- You don't need her, baby.

157
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:20,846
Sylvia's got everything you want.
- Do you have a pineapple pizza?

158
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:25,366
Pineapple and pepperoni.
- This is all going so fast.

159
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,622
We should be getting back to the party.

160
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:34,026
Marjorie, that party was beneath a woman
of your elegance and sophistication.

161
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,846
You... Oh, look, a budget motel.

162
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:45,338
I see the word 'Vacancy' is lit
and the word 'No' is not.

163
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:48,838
Let us pray the 'No' is not broken, huh?

164
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:55,848
Alberto, I'm not sure
if this is such a good idea.

165
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,718
First we make love,
then we decide if it was a good idea.

166
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,858
That's the European way.

167
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,931
I came here once with Marge.
Are you Marge, Sylvia?

168
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:15,516
Homer, I can be whoever
you want me to be.

169
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,072
I want you to be Marge.

170
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,410
Marge?

171
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,449
HOMER: Marge, is that you?
- My husband!

172
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,319
Why do married women
always have husbands?

173
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,962
Marge, what are you doing here?
- The same thing you're doing here.

174
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,867
You better not be! I mean, great!

175
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,868
We both came to rekindle
our precious memories...

176
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,504
...of when we were young
and in love. Right?

177
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,769
We sure did. Rekindle, rekindle...
Okay, let's go.

178
00:12:55,908 --> 00:13:01,263
I have a better idea.
Let's spend the night together right here.

179
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:06,085
Fine. But I don't want to sleep
in the same room with that chest.

180
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:09,055
I feel the same way about that lamp.

181
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,716
Okay. But first the chest.

182
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,825
Okay!

183
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,764
There you are!

184
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:21,033
Homie, what's taking so long?

185
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,369
Listen, you're a classy lady
and a great sushi fighter,

186
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,571
but you're going in the box!

187
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,935
Homie?
- Coming, Marge.

188
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,655
Good evening. I am Alberto.

189
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,524
Sylvia. Let's get out of this chest
and go have a drink.

190
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,460
Actually, I am quite comfortable here.

191
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,130
There is a flask of cognac in my pocket.
Do you think you can reach it?

192
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,968
SYLVIA: Okay. Is this it?
ALBERTO: No. But don't stop twisting.

193
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:02,608
Now let's spend the rest of the night
making sweet, sweet...

194
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,543
Kids?

195
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:08,893
I'm through babysitting these monsters!
Good night.

196
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:13,695
We won! He's asleep!
- And we'll stay up forever!

197
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:23,395
Well, that takes care of those three.
Want to go for a lakeside snuggle?

198
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,861
Homer Simpson, you devil.

199
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:35,708
Well, that takes care of those three.
Want to go play some Lakeside Boggle?

200
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,743
Homer Simpson, you devil.

201
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,420
But I think we should unpack first.

202
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:48,017
All right. The trick is to ease them off.

203
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,896
What is this dump?

204
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,835
Ruthie, this dump is where
your mother and I met.

205
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:09,055
It was a tale of betrayal, redemption
and a lovely continental breakfast.

206
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:13,254
Homer, those are our wedding bungees!

207
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,982
Marjorie?
- Homer?

208
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,786
It's so good to see you.
We owe you two a debt of thanks.

209
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:24,723
Homer, if I hadn't come to this motel
with you, I never would have met Alberto.

210
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,994
And Marjorie,
if you had completed your seduction of me,

211
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,297
I never would have met Sylvia.

212
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:37,970
I can't believe one of the most beautiful
moments in our marriage is based on lies.

213
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,805
You're just as bad as me,

214
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:43,142
and you used to be better,
so that makes you worse!

215
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:46,445
I don't think
we can ever trust each other again.

216
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:50,625
Ruthie, kick me away from this nightmare.
- Okay.

217
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,608
I wish I'd never met you.

218
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,620
Or you.

219
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,228
Why can't you just admit we're lost?

220
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:05,064
I'll tell you what's lost,
your sense of adventure.

221
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,766
Just ask those guys for directions.

222
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,841
Anti-nuclear activist,
Dr. Helen Caldicott?

223
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:12,438
Director Julie Taymor?

224
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:15,441
Do you love these women?
- They're okay, I guess.

225
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,743
Let's just skip
to the Windsor knot instructions.

226
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:21,447
Excuse me, boys.
My brother is lost and kind of a jerk.

227
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:25,951
If he'd brought a map of the grounds
as I suggested, then we...

228
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:29,321
Lisa, do you know why I spend every day
after school in detention?

229
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,490
So I don't have to come home to you!

230
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,927
Oh, Bart.
Don't say things you can't take back.

231
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,495
It's out there. Deal with it.

232
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,765
Oh, great. Now you woke the baby.

233
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,967
I told you we should've left her
with your mother!

234
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:45,093
My God, Bart. What happened to us?

235
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,505
We grew up.

236
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:57,783
So I'm sure you missed Marge last night.
- Yeah. I missed her like five times.

237
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:01,220
What a charming single entendre.
Now look, I know marriage is scary,

238
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,057
but if you really think she's the one,
it gives you two a shot at forever!

239
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,792
Forever? That would be awesome.

240
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,862
Okay, here she comes.

241
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:13,699
Why don't you take Marge for a walk,
open your heart and see what pours out?

242
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,304
I suppose you and Maude
will be coming along, as well?

243
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:24,076
Don't you think I got better things to do
on my honeymoon than spy on you two?

244
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:27,246
Red Dog, this is Moustache One.
We have possible male-female interaction.

245
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:31,256
Be prepared to terminate
inappropriate contact.

246
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,554
Ready with the ice water.
- NED: Lock onto his wiener.

247
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,323
We have wiener lock.

248
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,258
Marge, when I'm with you,

249
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:43,696
I get that feeling like when I got that
smart kid's report card by mistake.

250
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:50,341
And for a minute, I thought I had all A's
and that my name was Howard Simberg.

251
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:54,573
You make me feel that way, too.
- I know we'll get married some day.

252
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,875
And to prove it,
I'll carve our names on this tree...

253
00:17:56,975 --> 00:18:00,720
...so all who are hopelessly
lost in the woods...

254
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,820
...can see it.

255
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,243
I hate other people's love.

256
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:27,206
So that wasn't Marge's glider
parked outside the motel five years ago.

257
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:32,644
I'm getting out of this marriage
while I'm still young and handsome!

258
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,413
Mmm?

259
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,116
Forever.

260
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:42,278
I couldn't even keep a promise
I made to a tree.

261
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,991
Maybe it's not too late.
Maybe I can still save our love!

262
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,981
If I just show her that carving...

263
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:57,417
What are you doing?
- Saving our marriage!

264
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:58,971
Don't be silly.

265
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:03,746
Our marriage can weather any storm,
just like this tree.

266
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,237
Help! Fat man hanging from a tree!

267
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,026
Uh-uh. That's for fires.

268
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:18,690
Take my hand!

269
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,293
I don't want to let go
of our special carving!

270
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,129
Homer, our marriage
isn't on a piece of bark!

271
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:27,392
It's in us! Now take my hand.

272
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,455
Marge, I don't want to die
with us mad at each other.

273
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,989
Me, neither, Homie.

274
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,158
I know parts of our marriage
are based on lies,

275
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,528
but so are a lot of good things,
religion, American history...

276
00:19:56,628 --> 00:20:00,566
I know. We had a fight.
We were both tempted. We're human.

277
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,236
The important thing is we love each other.

278
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,744
Now we wait for the river to freeze
if my theory of global cooling is correct.

279
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,147
Hey, you guys want a
lift in my pedal boat?

280
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,515
It's not a pedal boat.

281
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,184
It's a pedal car
that Bart drove into the river...

282
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:22,020
...because he knows a shortcut
that's not on the map.

283
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,456
How would you like a shortcut
to the bottom of the river?

284
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,296
If it's your shortcut,
I'll be high and dry.

285
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:34,366
Knock it off back there.
- But we're married.

286
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,136
Okay. But keep it PG.
- How about R?

287
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,796
PG-13.
- Adult situations!

288
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,182
English - US - SDH
