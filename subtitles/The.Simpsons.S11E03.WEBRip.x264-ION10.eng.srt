Welcome
to the Springfield Shopper,

64
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,530
established in 1883.

65
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,696
The newspaper was founded
by Johnny Newspaperseed,

66
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,075
a 14-year-old boy

67
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,752
who roamed America
founding newspapers.

68
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,581
If he's so smart,
how come he's dead?

69
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,125
Over the years,
the shopper merged

70
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,382
with the <i>Springfield Times,</i>
<i>Post, Globe, Herald,</i>

71
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,134
<i>Jewish News</i>
and <i>Hot Sex Weekly</i>

72
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,636
to become Springfield's
number-one newspaper.

73
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:43,181
Wow! A bustling
metropolitan newsroom

74
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,644
funneling scoops
from all over the globe.

75
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,185
Hi! Are you interested

76
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,898
in a subscription
to the Shopper?

77
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,728
Low introductory rates!

78
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,273
No, please you gotta help ol' Gil.

79
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,067
What's it gonna take
to keep you on the phone?

80
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,531
Dance for you?
But you wouldn't even see it.

81
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,162
Yeah. All right.
(chuckles)

82
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,869
I'm dancin'!
(humming)

83
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,624
And this is our
comic strip department.

84
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,583
Who here reads Mary Worth?

85
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:09,873
Let's move on.

86
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,089
This is where we store
Ann Landers and Dear Abby

87
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,421
for their 23 hours
of daily sleep.

88
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:21,257
My advice is to free us
or let us die!

89
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,721
Check it out, Dad.
You can print out the headline

90
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,965
from the day you were born.

91
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,516
Ooh! Pointless nostalgia!

92
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:33,152
I'd sure hate to be him.
(laughs, groans)

93
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,191
And to protect Mother Earth,

94
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,815
each copy contains a certain
percentage of recycled paper.

95
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,573
And what percent is that?

96
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,825
Zero! Zero's a percent!

97
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,456
Hey, I smell cake.
Cake that says--

98
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,039
(sniffs) "farewell" and--

99
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,205
(sniffs, gasps) ..."best wishes!"

100
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,754
Your old man
has an awesome nose.

101
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,218
Oh, that's nothing.
He can hear pudding.

102
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,719
So, Mimi, this little shindig
is our way of saying farewell

103
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,263
to our favorite food critic.

104
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:10,307
What can I say except thanks
for the predictable champagne,

105
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,563
pizza that's hardly <i>numero uno</i>

106
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,435
and ice-cream cake
which reminds us,

107
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,902
why make 31 flavors when
you can't get vanilla right?

108
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,404
I wouldn't want
to be married to her.

109
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,646
I mean, again.

110

ruining my retirement party?

112
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:31,495
I'll have you know,
I wandered off from the tour.

113
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,541

you like the food.

114
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,046

I just had a thought.

125
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,154
We're looking
for a new food critic,

126
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:01,942
someone who doesn't immediately
pooh-pooh everything he eats.

127
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,738
No, it usually
takes a few hours.

128
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,951
Uh, look...

129
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,242
I'd like to give you a tryout.

130
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,866
Write a 500-word sample review.

131
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:14,423
If it passes muster,
we'll put you on staff.

132
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,579
Thanks for the chance.

133
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,746
You won't never regret this,
Mr. Editing Guy.

134
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,878
You know, Homie,
the "e" doesn't work

135
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,384
on that typewriter.

136
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,756
We don't need no stinkin' "e."

137
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,473
"Restaurant review." No.

138
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,474
"Eatery evaluation." No.

139
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,266
(gasps)
"Food box - Go or no go,

140
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,191

141
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,649

142
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,612
(laughs)

143
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,833
Well, what do you think?

144
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,738
This is a joke, right?

145
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,367
I mean,
this is the stupidest thing

146
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,453
I've ever read.

147
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,958
What's wrong with it?

148
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,539
Well, you keep using words

149
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,674
like "pasghetti"
and "momatoes."

150
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,172
You make numerous
threatening references to the U.N.

151
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:07,006
And at the end, you repeat
the words "screw Flanders"

152
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,013
over and over again.

153
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,305
Oh, it's so hard
to get to 500 words.

154
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,770
Oh, look, Homer, I'm sorry.

155
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,651
No! You're right! It's a joke!
(chuckles)

156
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,518
Everyone laugh
at the funny joke! Ha-ha!

157
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,936
I'll be right back
with the real review.

158
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,275
(door slams)

159
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,860
(Homer whimpering)

160
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,655

Stink of failure still on me.

162
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,195
LISA: Dad, I'm sorry the editor
didn't like your review.

163
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,827
I'll help you write
a new review

164
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,253
if you'll just let me
use the bathroom!

165
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,542
Still not clean.
Still not clean!

166
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,724
Okay, what restaurant
did we review?

167
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,008
{\an8}Well, we went
to <i>Pate Labelle </i>last week.

168
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,892
-How about that?
-Great. Now let me think.

169
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,639
The food was--

170
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,768
Mmm-- not undelicious.

171
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,519
The food is delicious.

172
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,891
(gasps) That's brilliant!

173
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,187
Then I had the sweet,
sweet chocolate mousse.

174
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,522
Really,
the only word for it is...

175
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,938
(groaning)

176
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,196
Hmm. What's the English
equivalent for...

177
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,658
(groaning)

178
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,079
I'd say "transcendent."

179
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,409
How about
"groin-grabbingly transcendent"?

180
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,825
Er, I don't think so.

181
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,373
We make a good team.

182
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,416
A groin-grabbingly good team.

183
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,420
LISA:
Four hundred and ninety seven,

184
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,382
four hundred
and ninety eight words.

185
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,592
-Hmph.
-How about "screw Flanders"?

186
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,763
Bon appetit.

187
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:29,931
Er, both's good.

188
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,181
Not bad! Not bad at all!

189
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,184
We're gonna run
this on page one...

190
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,057
of section H2.

191
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,104
Whoo-hoo! Stop the presses!

192
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,438
-(gasps)
-(alarms blaring)

193
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,737
Okay, start the presses!

194
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,781
That takes four hours.

195
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,326
Whatever. I'll be at Moe's.

196
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,998
This is so exciting, Homie!
Your first restaurant review!

197
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,883
Marge. Shh!

198
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,710
It's important that no one
knows that I'm a food critic.

199
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,796
Hear that, Maude?
Homer's a critic!

200
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,721
Homer's a critic. Pass it on.

201
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,430
Did you hear? Homer's a critic.

202
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,140
Quit changing the subject!

203
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,350
Where is Uter?

204
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,639
Oh! We just want closure.

205
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,433
Arr! Here you are.

206
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,517
One critic's special.

207
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,812
Er, if anything appears
to be movin',

208
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,016
that's just freshness. Arr.

209
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,437
Can you believe it, Marge?

210
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,815
This job is the greatest.

211
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,491
They're paying me to eat!

212
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,990
Yeah. Now if you could
just get somebody

213
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,361
to pay you
for scratching your butt,

214
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,567
we'll be on easy street.

215
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,907
-Why, you little--
-(groaning)

216
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,616
Wow! My first published
article, whew,

217
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,246
although someone else's
name is on it.

218
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,923
He-he. Welcome
to the humiliating world

219
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,463
of professional writing.

220
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,626
But this is only the beginning.

221
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,933
Welcome to Planet Springfield!

222
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,894
The restaurant owned
by me, Chuck Norris,

223
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:04,845
Johnny Carson's third wife
and the Russian mafia.

224
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,727
Each Planet Springfield

225
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,614
is filled with priceless
Hollywood gewgaws.

226
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,362
(gasps) There's the coffee mug

227
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,614
from <i>Heartbeeps!</i>

228
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,775
And there's the cane

229
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,493
from <i>Citizen Kane!</i>

230
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,991
Wait a minute.
There was no cane

231
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,786
in <i>Citizen Kane </i>.

232
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,410
And there's that awful script

233
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,706
from <i>The Cable Guy </i>.

234
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,079
Lemme see. Stupid script!

235
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,247
Nearly wrecked
Jim Carrey's career!

236
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,046
You-- (grunting)

237
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,879
I'm gonna... what?

238
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,715
The food is exquisite!

239
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:42,684
And the view is... beautiful...

240
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,227
inspirational...

241
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,856
nauseating.
(groans)

242
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,439
Hey, Homer! Great call
on that chicken place!

243
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,276
And on that rib place!

244
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,072
I never knew
everything was so good!

245
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,237
Look, Marge.
I'm making a difference

246
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,696
in people's lives.

247
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,956
Yes, Simpson, your love
of food is contagious.

248
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,959
I've never felt jollier. (cracking)

249
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,791
Ooh!
There go my shin bones again.

250
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,549
Hey, Homer! Come here.

251
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,554
(gasps)
Are you gonna fire me

252
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,096
for swiping office supplies?

253
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,759
-No.
-Whew!

254
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,602
(clacking)

255
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,234
Some of your fellow critics
wanted to meet you.

256
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:30,151
This is Garth Trelawney, TV critic.

257
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,361
Why, you-- you made them
cancel <i>Platypus Man...</i>

258
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,442
Homer!

259
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,067
This is our theater critic,

260
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,783
Daphne Beaumont.

261
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,203
...and the <i>Cosby Mysteries!</i>

262
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,161
That show had
limitless possibilities!

263
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,334
-Homer, please!
-Sorry.

264
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,661
Jamie Killday,
farm supply critic.

265
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,666
Just got back from
the <i>Gopher Poison </i>show

266
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,128
in Paris. Let me tell you
something, people.

267
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,129
The days of clubbing them
with a baseball bat are over!

268
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,762
For you, perhaps.

269
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,589
Listen, we've been meaning
to have a talk

270
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,014
with you about your reviews.

271
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,342
Everything's a rave!
Nine thumbs up?

272
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,718
What the hell is that?

273
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,724
{\an8}I've given out my share
of bad reviews.

274
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,556
Oh! The only bad review
you gave was

275
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,691
to a slice of pizza
you found under the couch.

276
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,148
It lost some points
'cause it had a hot wheel on it.

277
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,899
Oh, good Lord, man.
You're a critic!

278
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,571
You don't have to like
everything,

279
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,989
e.g., my latest review.
(clears throat)

280
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,698
"We see John Deere has come out

281
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,738
with this year's
line of rototillers.

282
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,372
Surprise, surprise,
they're green!

283
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,950
I say it's time to send
John Deere a 'Dear John."'

284
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,117
-Oh, that's classic!
-You don't have to patronize me.

285
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,577
Aaa-- okay.

286
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,669
Lord, thy daughters...

287
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,005
Goneril, Regan and Cordelia.

288
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,141
What is this, merry old England
or petticoat junction?

289
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,759
(laughing)

290
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,846
(audience boos, hisses,
heckles)

291
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,390
(groaning)

292
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,144
Hey! Lighten up. It's a comedy.

293
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,225
-No, it's not.
-It's not?

294
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,151
(groans)

295
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,686
Hmm. This pea soup
is as weak as the acting

296
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,646
and nowhere near as hammy.

297
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,156
Dad! That's so mean!

298
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,908
The other critics
told me to be mean,

299
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,240
and you should always
give in to peer pressure.

300
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,156
But what if someone bad
tells me to--

301
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,164
Always!

302
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,405
{\an8}Huh? Huh?

303
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,577
{\an8}Whoa! This material stinks!

304
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,665
I'm gonna have to punch it up
on the fly.

305
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,961
Oh, I got one!
How do you make a King Lear?

306
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,875
Put the queen in a bikini!

307
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,513
-(chuckles, groans)
-(audience boos)

308
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,930
Here's another one.
Knock, knock. Who's there?

309
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,679
"Juliet." "Juliet who?"

310
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,181
Juliet so much pasta fazool,

311
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,433
Romeo doesn't want her anymore!

312
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,886
-(laughing)
-(booing continues)

313
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,806
Whoa, tough crowd!
They're booing Shakespeare!

314
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,565
(chomping)

315
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,073
Uh, not bad...

316
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,034
if lasagna is Italian
for "pile of puke"!

317
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,699
Aah! I chopp-a you good!

318
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,985
(shouts in foreign language)

319
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,078
Well, I hope you cut me better

320
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,213
than you did
these string beans.

321
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,420
Hmm. I seem to be missing
a piece of my ear. Touché.

322
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,301
Who wants pork chops?

323
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,301
Mmm.

324
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,558
Sorry, Marge.

325
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,348
I'm afraid this gets my lowest

326
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,101
rating ever! Seven thumbs up.

327
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,064
You always liked my pork chops.

328
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,015
Marge, I'm sorry,
but your cooking's

329
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,646
only got two moves...

330
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,072
shake and bake.

331
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,611
You like shake 'n bake!

332
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,105
You used to put
it in your coffee!

333
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,736
People change, Marge.

334
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,833
My palate has grown
more sophisticated.

335
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,158
Oh, yeah? What's a palate?

336
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,329
Oh, it's a...

337
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,174
special time
in a boy's life when--

338
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,630
-Gotta go!
-(chair scraping)

339
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,420
So come to The Legless Frog...

340
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,303
if you want to get sick and die

341
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,840
and leave
a big, garlicky corpse!

342
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,184
P.S., parking was ample.

343
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,759
{\an8}Dad, you're being cruel for no reason.
What will people think?

344
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,886
People will think
what I tell them to think,

345
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,603
when you tell me
what to tell them to think.

346
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,023
{\an8}Not anymore.
I don't want to be partners

347
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,442
{\an8}with a man
who thinks like that.

348
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,611
Nobody talks to me that way!
I'm Homer Simpson,

349
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,230
the most powerful food critic in town,

350
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,318
who will never
get his comeuppance!

351
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,243
You hear me?
No comeuppance!

352
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,067
We'll be right back.

353
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,042
I don't need Lisa
to write a good review.

354
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:17,251
The food at
The Gilded Truffle really...

355
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,793
uh-what's a good word?

356
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,916
(sucking)

357
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,382
Sucks! That's great!

358
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:25,222
And the bread was really...

359
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,589
Come on!
Help me out here!

360
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,215
-Ruff!
-Rough?

361
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,722
I don't know. You've been
pitchin' that all night.

362
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,774
-Chewy?
-Chewy!

363
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,478
That's inspired!

364
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,226
{\an8}Homer, what gives
with this review?

365
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,784
{\an8}You say "the salad
tastes like bark"

366
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,778
{\an8}and the potatoes
were very "grrrrr!"

367
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,781
This reads like
it was written by a dog.

368
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,373
Are you crazy?
A dog can't type.

369
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,579
(mutters) Unfortunately.

370
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,699
Listen, you gotta shape up!
Next week

371
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,117
is the Taste of Springfield festival.

372
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,996
You'll be reviewing
every restaurant in town.

373
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,674
Remember,
people have certain expectations

374
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,003
about the "Life Ways" section.

375
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,378
Really? Like what?

376
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,384
Oh, I don't know.

377
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,756
Astrology, <i>Broom-Hilda </i>,
vacation horror stories <i>,</i>

378
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,215
articles about
chronic fatigue syndrome...

379
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,926
you know, chick crap.

380
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,016
(angry muttering)

381
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:21,562
Homer, he's outta control.
He gave me a bad review!

382
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,397
So, my friend
put a horse head on his bed.

383
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,783
He ate the head
and gave it a bad review!

384
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,860
True story.

385
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,485
Arr, well, I've had it with Homer!

386
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,911
His bad reviews
are sinkin' our businesses.

387
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,202
Then, why did you put yours
in the window?

388
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,830
Arr, it covered up the "D"
from the health inspector.

389
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:43,125
Well, I say we ban Homer
from our restaurants.

390
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,340
No. That would be impolite.

391
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,591
I say we kill him!

392
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,922
Now, hold on a minute.

393
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,587
Are we restauranteurs,
or are we murderers?

394
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,636
Does that answer your question?

395
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:58,348
We'll kill him at
The Taste of Springfield festival.

396
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,564
We'll give Homer
all he can eat,

397
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,354
till he can eat no more.

398
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,608
Then, he'll get
his just dessert.

399
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,951
This will be Homer Simpson's
last lagniappe.

400
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,120
Come on!
You're gonna kill him with a pastry?

401
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,698
I've seen this man
eat a bowl of change.

402
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,794
This eclair has
over one million calories.

403
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,251
Twenty-five pounds of butter
per square inch.

404
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,882
-(all moan)
-Covered with chocolate

405
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,299
so dark, light cannot escape
its surface.

406
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,959
(clamoring)

407
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,088
No, no, no!

408
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,634
This is just a picture.

409
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,467
But Homer Simpson
will find the real thing

410
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,473
both delicious and deadly.

411
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,516
Ah, yes! Death by chocolate.

412
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,901
(laughs)
Oh.

413
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,858
And poison.
I'll stick in some poison.

414
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:48,278
(all laughing)

415
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,819
Homie, my woman's intuition's acting u

416
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,867
Something bad's going to happen
if you go in there.

417
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,251
Oh, Marge, something bad
usually happens to me

418
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,749
when I go in anywhere.

419
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,290
(whistling)

420
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,173
-D'oh! Ohh! (grunting)
-(bat squealing)

421
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,171
A bat. Now, that's a new one!

422
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,340
So what are you up to,
young lady?

423
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,182
I'm reviewing the festival
for our school paper.

424
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:17,048
Oh. Well, I'm glad to see
my ex-partner

425
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,347
is doing so well without me.

426
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,561
(groans)

427
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,452
(chomping)

428
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,536
Pedestrian.

429
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:44,956
Uninspired.

430
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,625
I didn't say stop.

431
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,131
Lard ho!

432
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,093
Arr, 'tis a good sign.

433
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,093
Homer's unfastened
the top button on his pants.

434
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,426
Uh, no, he's been walking
around like that since Thanksgiving.

435
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,643
I'm surprised
he just doesn't give it up

436
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:02,933
and go for sweat pants.

437
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:06,226
He says the crotch
wears out too fast.

438
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:10,021
Yarrr! That's gonna replace
the whale in my nightmares!

439
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,607
Well, don't worry.

440
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,652
The giant eclair will knock

441
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,695
Homer off the food page

442
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,239
and into the obituaries.

443
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,373
(both laughing)

444
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,123
Wait a minute.
They're gonna kill Dad!

445
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,012
Ooh!

446
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,137
Oh, that's a spicy meat-ball!

447
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,221
So if we don't find Dad,
this crazy French guy

448
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,807
-is gonna kill him!
-(sighs)

449
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,142
Only your father could take
a part-time job

450
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,017
at a small-town paper
and wind up

451
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,574
the target
of international assassins.

452
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,438
We can find him faster
by splitting up.

453
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,525
You take fried foods,
you take salty snacks,

454
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,151
I'll take desserts. Break!

455
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,451
Ohh! So full.

456
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,294
Belly button moving from

457
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,329
innie to... (creaking) outie!

458
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:13,302
(chomping, smacking)

459
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,302
Ooh, that looks
scrumdiddly-doodly-duddley--

460
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,973
-Get lost!
-A rude Frenchman?

461
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,762
Well, I never!

462
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,096
(gasps)
Ooh! Sweet!

463
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,852
(smacking lips)

464
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,394
(panting)

465
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,767
Ooh!
(chuckles)

466
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,691
Dad, no!

467
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,989
It's gonna kill you!

468
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,242
Ehh, I've had a good run.

469
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,452
(grunting)
Don't, uh--

470
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,123
Um, it's low-fat!

471
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,542
No!

472
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,338
Whew! That was close.
Thank God

473
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,048
it landed
in that smoking crater!

474
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,338
(humming "La Marseillaise")

475
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,932
-Huh?
-Take him into custardy, boys!

476
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,388
Hah! Attempted murder one.

477
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,933
Now, boys, what would you say
to some Belgian waffles?

478
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,064
Actually, I was in the mood
for some frittatas.

479
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,141
Ha! Lou and his frittatas!

480
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,687
(laughing)

481
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,651
Frittatas! Ha-ha!

482
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:15,981
Oh, he likes eggs.

483
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,396
Oh, Lisa, you saved me!

484
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:21,405
And after all the bad things
I said about you.

485
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,368
What bad things? Why?

486
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:27,658
Oh, Lisa, the important thing is
I didn't get my comeuppance,

487
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,374
and I never will.

488
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,789
Uh, Dad?

489
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,036
I know, honey.

490
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,258
The important thing is... run!

491
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,668
-(elephants trumpeting)
-(all shouting)

492
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,337
-(Homer groaning, whimpering)
-(blows landing)

493
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,717
<i>HOMER: I'm finally getting</i>
<i>my comeuppance!</i>

494
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,596
(theme music playing)

495
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,139
Shh!
