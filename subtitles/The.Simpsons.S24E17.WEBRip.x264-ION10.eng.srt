shots three point attempts?

175
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,238
What are you doing home from work?

176
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,779
I'm fighting for you, babe.

177
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,952
Fighting like I would for the last slice
of cold pizza in the box.

178
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,912
And to show you how serious I am...

179
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,003
From the gas station?

180
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:19,288
From the place beside the gas station.

181
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,423
Hmm.

182
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,460
Well, that does sound good.

183
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,634
I'll just stick this
in your apology card drawer.

184
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,844
(grunting)

185
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,762
(gasps)

186
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,024
No. I'm tired of your broken promises.

187
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,518
"Marge, I'm gonna lose ten pounds."

188
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,771
"Sweetie, I'll be home at 8:00 p.m."

189
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,733
"Sweetie, I'll be home at 8:00 a.m."

190
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,523
"I'll take you out

191
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,487
to the most romantic lunch
of your life." I'm done!

192
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,156
Marge was so happy
when I made those promises.

193
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,991
What changed?

194
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,503
(gasps)

195
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:07,054
Milhouse, seeing you there
saying nothing...

196
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,379
it's the cutest you've ever been.

197
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,125
-Uh...
-Hush, sweet boy.

198
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,677
Let me get lost
in the blue of your eyebrows.

199
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,431
Whatever.

200
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,603
Did you bring me that sandwich
what I sent you out for?

201
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,483
It came with fries or salad.

202
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,440
Whichever you picked, you picked wrong.

203
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,480
Well, I wasn't sure, so I got both.

204
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,614
(chuckles)
Who knows her little Milhouse?

205
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,571
<i>I'm acting like a jerk,</i>
<i>and Lisa's eating it up.</i>

206
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,242
<i>Why don't I feel good?</i>

207
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,120
<i>I need advice from the most</i>
<i>important woman in my life.</i>

208
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,619
So everything was going great,

209
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:41,962
and then I wondered if the me
she likes is the real me.

210
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,629
Well, let me say this is the first time

211
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,669
you've been brave enough
to sit in this office

212
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,052
without a bunny in your lap.

213
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,379
Where is the bunny?!

214
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,803
He's in the closet. He's fine.

215
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,295
I'm over here, Milhouse. Focus.

216
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,846
You got to help me, Doc.

217
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,099
I just don't know what to do.

218
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,891
Don't worry, I'm here for you,

219
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,685
and I'll be here for as long as it takes.

220
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,899
-(phone rings)
-I'm fired?

221
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,570
You're on your own.
I'll clean out my office immediately.

222
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,450
I'll show you how to clean out an office!

223
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,450
I don't usually say this
to kids, but don't be yourself.

224
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,544
Because yourself is not working.

225
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,080
-Be that guy you just were.
-Gotcha.

226
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,341
Oh, I love you, Fluffy Fella.

227
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,844
I just got fired!
I need it more than you.

228
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,426
Fluffy Fella!

229
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,011
Fella...!

230
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,477
<i>NARRATOR: Meanwhile, Homer</i>
<i>was doing something</i>

231
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,188
<i>very difficult for him-- thinking.</i>

232
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,689
How do I win Marge over?

233
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,732
I could get her kids to like me.

234
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,935
No, that ship has sailed.

235
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,486
Hmm.

236
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:57,409
<i>NARRATOR: Fortunately, the modern man</i>
<i>has a third alternative.</i>

237
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,580
Hmm. Would it make a woman happy

238
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,329
to do the things she asked you to do?

239
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,713
{\an8}I think it would.

240
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,630
Searchy, where can I find brake fluid?

241
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:12,379
{\an8}<i>There are 14 Taco Joes in your area.</i>

242
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,223
That was yesterday.

246
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,596
Oh, I can't please any woman.

247
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,393
(groans)

248
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,099
(Bart and Milhouse giggling)

249
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:32,477
Milhouse, I'm not sure why you left me
in the forest, so I made cookies.

250
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,696
But I didn't know what kind you liked,
so I made seven kinds.

251
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,238
(gasps) I've become my mother.

252
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:41,532
Well, common sense never
goes out of style. (groans)

253
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,237
(shrieks)
That was too easy.

254
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:46,407
Lisa! Did you see Marlon Brando

255
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,077
in "Mutiny on the Bounty"?

256
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,995
No, nobody did.

257
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,214
Then this is just me.

258
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,509
(yells)

259
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,431
Ta-da.

260
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,639

-(grunts)

261
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,009
Bart! Milhouse!

262
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:03,972
Hmm.

263
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,636
(chuckling)

264
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,649
Okay, let's see how straight it is.

265
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,815
(grunts)

266
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,663
Guess who's coming to dinner.

267
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,069
What have I told you
about comical entrances?

268
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,578
Sorry.

269
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,749
But you never said anything
about comical exits.

270
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,130
Homie, what are you doing?

271
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,168
I'm planing down that door
that always sticks.

272
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,303
I put training wheels on Bart's bike,

273
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,840
and made an appointment
with the dermatologist

274
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,474
to see about my slowly receding hairline.

275
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,302
Oh, Homer.

276
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,757
Yes, my love?

277
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,517
This list is from six years ago.

278
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,390
Oh, well, you know how,
in the Special Olympics,

279
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,438
they give medals just for showing up?

280
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,231
How many times
do I have to tell you to quit

281
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:58,606
comparing our relationship
to the Special Olympics?

282
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:02,744
<i>NARRATOR: When all is lost,</i>
<i>a man's mind turns to one thing</i>

283
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,493
<i>and one thing only.</i>

284
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,695
What fish may I deplete from our oceans

285
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,207
for your passing pleasure?

286
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,788
Perhaps some shark fin soup?

287
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,754
Whale tonsils?

288
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,423
Baby dolphin blowhole?

289
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,632
Turtle smile?

290
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,671
I'd like a lot of food,

291
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,795
and for this to be the last
decision I have to make.

292
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,052
Hai, you want omakase-- chef's choice.

293
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,845
You're all I have left.

294
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,809
I trust you completely.

295
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,059
And I you.

296
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,680
Let me run your credit card

297
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,307
to celebrate that trust.

298
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,193
Okay.

299
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,440
This should do it.

300
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,322
Thank you, Mr. Franders.

00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,887
I see tears in your toro.

311
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,930
Marriage is so tough.

312
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,933
Every second, it could
explode catastrophically.

313
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,766

to come home from my job

314

315
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,768
I say marriage is like fish.

316
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,566
There are parts so delicious

317
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,529
they could've been sliced from angels...

318
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,570
...and parts we make into omakase.

319
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,574
Omakase...

320
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,656
Where have I heard that word before?

321
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,991
You haven't-- now, finish your omakase.

322
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,577
Although we have but one ocean,

323
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,503
it offers many special delights.

324
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,835
(screams)

325
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,669
Wow.

326
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,835
Wow, this is the most delicious
analogy I've ever eaten.

327
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,175
I need to share this insight with Marge.

328
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,851
Put this in your finest Styrofoam.

329
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,770
(clamoring)

330
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,345
Once again, by eating alone,

331
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,936
I have saved my marriage.

332
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,771
Please enjoy, with my compliments.

333
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,607
You can even eat the eyes.

334
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,703
Hmm.

335
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,818
He ate the eye. (laughs)

336
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,082
HOMER: Marge?

337
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,829
For reasons I forgot in the car,

338
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,213
this sushi represents our marriage.

339
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,540
But what I know for sure is that
I want to share it with you.

340
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,257
<i>MARGE: He's taken a step.</i>
<i>He's really close.</i>

341
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,552
<i>All he has to do is not eat</i>
<i>a piece before I do.</i>

342
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,101
<i>Okay.</i>

343
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,734
<i>But every man deserves a second chance.</i>

344
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,401
<i>As long as he doesn't...</i>

345
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,151
I'm not hungry.

346
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,232
Good night.

347
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,027
Well, at least you don't
have to suffer, boy.

348
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,158
(gasps)

349
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:55,662
Someone fed my sushi to a dog!

350
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,996
You didn't get so mad when I
told you I was fired today.

351
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,883
Blessing in disguise.

352
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,800
Now you can get your PhD.

353
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,798
I don't want a PhD. I want a baby.

354
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,841
(groans) Here we go again.

355
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,891
Lisa, I could be anyone for you.

356
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,936
Except someone who's mean to you.

357
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,559
So I'm just gonna cave in
and give you the cupcake.

358
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,898
I don't know... it's four days old,

359
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,324
I just ate...

360
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,032
Who are you, the Queen of Siam?

361
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,822
Just take the cupcake.

362
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,905
Okay.

363
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,695
I wonder if Brando liked cupcakes.

364
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,496
<i>I'm down to two a day,</i>
<i>but I've been dead for ten years.</i>

365
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,751
Aw, Moe. Can you think of a way

366
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,964
to please a woman that starts with "F"?

367
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,964
Hey, you know, it's funny
you should mention that.

368
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,296
I've been reading that, uh,
<i>Fifty Shades of Grey,</i>

369
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,012
and it turns out that what
chicks want now is a guy

370
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,223
to give them what for
in the bedroom there.

371
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:56,143
Whoo-hoo!
I'll woo her with whoo-hoo.

372
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,482
Ah, you know, if this is what women like,

373
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,401
I should be a lot more popular.

374
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,729
But it does inspire me
to work on my fan fiction.

375
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:09,106
"Sheriff Andy took Barney in his arms

376
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,744
and kissed him deeply, then said,

377
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,702
'Now, if Aunt Bee asks,

378
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,242
we were down at the fishin' hole.'"

379
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,995
I-I can't be the only one who likes this.

380
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,090
Hello, there.

381
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,424
(gasps)

382
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,915
The minister's wife--
what are you doing here?

383
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,047
Um... protesting.

384
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,434
Is this dominating enough
for you, sweetheart?

385
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,181
Go back to the cowboy thing
and wait in the car.

386
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,434
Help me out here, Homer.

387
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,675
(nervous laugh)

388
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,518
Listen, pal,

389
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,103
this may sound kind of kinky,

390
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,108
but, uh, I would like to, uh,

391
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,031
please my wife.

392
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,279
Well,
are you comfortable with role play?

393
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,571
(Cockney accent) I think I could give it
a shot what-what, governor.

394
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,156
-Bob's your uncle.
-Okay, no role play.

395
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,622
(groans)

396
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,038
HOMER (singsong): Oh, Marge.

397
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,963
Come to the garage.

398
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,463
You know it'll be good
'cause I'm saying it

399
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,465
in a singsong fashion.

400
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,468
(gasps)

401
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,010
It's a snuggle dungeon.

402
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,465
Hey, Homer, can I get back my...

403
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,894
(screams)

404
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,732
What does this do?

405
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,139
Now, just relax. Sit down...

406
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,268
Not in that chair! It has no bottom!

407
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,565
This is not putting me in the mood.

408
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,859
Anger's a mood.

409
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,112
Why would you think I'd like this?

410
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,704
I don't know.
It's just that you always say

411
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,280
we should try new things.

412
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:40,575
But I thought snuggle clamps
just might rekindle...

413
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,541
(screaming)

414
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,132
Quick, call
the Procter & Gamble help line!

415
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,038
Really? Geez, they make everything.

416
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,338
(pained sigh)

417
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,757
Huh?

418
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,012
<i>HOMER: Oh, my God, Marge is here.</i>

419
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,014
<i>What is she thinking now?</i>

420
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,006
I'm glad you're okay.

421
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,268
Mmm?

422
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,179
Now, I'm going to give you

423
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,098
a powerful muscle relaxant.

424
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,650
Hmm, that was just a placebo.

425
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,992
-What does that mean?
-Powerful drug.

426
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,028
(chuckles)

427
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,242
Homer, I'm glad that you tried,

428
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,372
even though now I can't
find the washing machine.

429
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,790
It's behind the Dingle Swing.

430
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,869
Oh...

431
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,253
So you forgive me?

432
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,960
Not because of what you bought,

433
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,750
but because I realized
that no matter what,

434
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,045
you will never stop trying,

435
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,469
and there's nothing a woman
loves more than that.

436
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,889
Aw, thanks, honey.

437
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:41,048
So, uh, you're not cool

438
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,638
with any of the toys?

439
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,933
Actually, I'm cool with one of them.

440
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,898
-Which one?
-Not gonna say.

441
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,808
-What size batteries?
-D.

442
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,147
-Ooh, how many?
-Sixteen.

443
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,442
Holy moly.

444
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,237
<i>NARRATOR: And so Homer</i>
<i>and Marge's marriage</i>

00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,447
