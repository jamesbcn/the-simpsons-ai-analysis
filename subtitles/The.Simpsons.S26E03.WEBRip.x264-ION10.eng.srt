at one company.

Started in the basement mailroom,

154
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,037
and ended his career jumping out
the window from the top floor.

162

Well, then why do you want this job?

163
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,071

I'm too nervous to sleep.

175
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,600
-(Homer grunts)
-(sighs)

176
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,218
-(grunts sleepily)
-(sighs aggressively)

177
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,176
(stammers awake)

178
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,596
I'm sorry I woke you up.

179
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,314
I'm just so anxious about tomorrow.

180
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,895
What if the store fails?

181
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,360
What if I fail?

182
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Well, you woke up the right man in bed.

183
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,107
I love you, Marjorie.

184
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,565
And I've had my share of failures, sure.

185
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,116
And sometimes I get pretty nervous.

186
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,410
But thanks for talking it out with me.

187
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,294
I think I can finally get to sleep now.

188
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,962
No! No, no, no!
It was me that couldn't get to...

189
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,041
(snoring)

190
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,626
(sighs)

191
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,301
(stammers awake)

192
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,800
Oh, make love now?

193
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,381
(groans)

194
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,046
(horn honks)

195
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:15,764
Say there, buddy, are you interested
in our Two-For-One Tuesday?

196
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,966
I never would have been,
till I got this flyer!

197
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,477
Interested in some exotic dancers, huh?

198
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,310
Today's
"Tell You Their Real Name" Tuesday.

199
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,396
Are you working two jobs here, Gil?

200
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,401
No, and I resent the accusation.

201
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,244
Tell me, it's pointing west, right?

202
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,860
<i>Hola.</i>

203
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,447
No change for the meter.

204
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,952
No, no, I'd like to see the manager.

205
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:41,575
Mrs. Boss!
Some fat blob wants to see you.

206
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,544
-MARGE: Homer!
-Marge.

207
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,964
Come on, let's celebrate!
It's your first day!

208
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,503
Homie, I'm a little worried.

209
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:52,217
Do you know there were no customers
between 2:00 and 4:00?

210
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,390
Hey, Tony Roma's wasn't built in a day.

211
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,219
But don't worry,
I told everyone about this place,

212
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,016
and they're all going to support you.

213
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,889
You do have drone delivery, right?
I kind of promised that.

214
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,727
We don't have drone delivery!

215
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,562
You'll have to find a substitute.

216
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,397
(humming a tune)

217
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,322
{\an8}-(screeches)
-HOMER: Damn it!

218
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,569
(humming)

219
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,282
(Marge groaning)

220
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,664
-(groans)
-What's wrong?

221
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:27,077
Mother Hubbard Central expects you
to buy a lot of stuff from them.

222
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,838
Uniforms, fixin's.

223
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,709
It's like they don't care
if you make money

224
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,626
as long as they make money.

225
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,255
What kind of corporation does that?

226
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,847
(stammers)
I'm not trying to be political,

227
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:42,309
but I'm the only one you can trust here.

228
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:44,983
(gasps)

229
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,897
Shauna! I saw that!

230
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,731
I'm going to have to let you go.

231
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,896
Oh, so you're, like, firing me like
in that movie where that girl gets fired?

232
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,237
I'm sorry.

233
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,452
If I'm fired, then he's quitting!

234
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,832
I am?!

235
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,663
Oh, that's what holds them up.

236
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,916
What am I going to do?

237
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,668
I'm down two employees,
and it's the afternoon rush.

238
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,711
(bell dings)

239
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,505
I need a six-foot party sub.

240
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,838
Lots of mayonnaise.
And I mean lots.

241
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,804
Never stop squirting mayo.

242
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,094
Don't worry, baby.

243
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,847
(humming a tune)

244
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,564
Thank you, Homie.

245
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,858
Why does this have to be so hard?!

246
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,190
Oh, uh, sorry there, Marge.

247
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,145
{\an8}This is my changing room.

248
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,486
{\an8}You are working two jobs!

249
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,321
{\an8}Oh, these are my real legs.

250
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,157
{\an8}I'm... I'm not a well man, Marge.

251
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,411
This is so sad.

252
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,377
In his homeland,
Dad was a nuclear engineer.

253
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,838
Oh, I was short-staffed
and your father volunteered.

254
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,510
Actually, I was wondering if you two
might want to lend a hand.

255
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,880
No, no.

256
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,587
You want to make American kids work?

257
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,808
You're supposed to be driving me
to a tennis class I said I wanted,

258
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,889
then I changed my mind
and I hate it so much

259
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,725
I'm faking stomachaches to get out of it.

260
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,150
Would it kill one of you
to wash a bell pepper?

261
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,069
Um, I'm not sure this is
the best use of my skills.

262
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,149
I said wash!
And, Bart, go work the deep fryer.

263
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,355
Well, if I'll be doing this when I'm 40,
might as well start now.

264
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,617
(humming a tune)

265
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,211
(gasps) I'm home.

266
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,539
Guys, this is gonna be hard for a while.

267
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,254
But we'll get through this as a family.

268
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,915
Yes, we will.

269
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,304
The Simpsons and old Uncle Gil.

270
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,802
Uh, Gil?

271
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,304
I've been meaning
to tell you you're fired.

272
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,006
Yeah, well, guess I had it coming.

273
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,887
Can I take some bologna heels?

274
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,064
-As many as you like.
-You sure?

275
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,813
Take them!

276
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,725
Aw, yeah! It's a big ol' fat one!

Oh, yeah. Real good baby.

290
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,277
Good everybody.

291
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,695
You won't believe it,

292
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,413
but we actually turned a profit today.

293
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,869
Kids, we're taking some shredded lettuce,

294
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,627
pre-sliced cheese, and cold cuts,

295
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:59,799
and turning them into the American dream.

296
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,341
Uh, guys, what the hell is that?

297
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,099
(gasps)
They're opening another Mother Hubbard?

298
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,942
Across the street?! How could they?

299
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,268
How could they?!

300
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,483
WIGGUM: Move, move, move!

301
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,356
Eh, Chief, uh, who are you fooling
with this one sandwich a day diet?

302
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,026
It's on whole wheat, Lou.

303
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,445
Cleans up your insides.

304
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,204
I'm gonna sit next to it.

305
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:37,379
How could they open
another franchise so close to me?

306
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,459
Don't worry, Marge.
They can't beat us.

307
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,205
Because we're family-run.

308
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,626
Aah! Hillbillies!

309
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,929
Okay, in you go,
Minimum Wade, Addem-up,

310
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,643
Oxycontin, Fontanelle, and Pediculus.

311
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,095
You make way for those that's nocturnal

312
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,975
coming off the night shift.

313
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,812
(squealing)

314
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,228
Huh?

315
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,568
(sighs)

316
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,402
(yawns)

317
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,737
Mom, I need a few hours off.

318
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,583
It's Milhouse's birthday party,
and I'm all the guests.

319
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,909
I understand, honey.

320
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,414
-Did you get someone to cover?
-Mm. Grampa.

321
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,416
I'm working the drive-through!

322
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,328
There is no drive-through!

323
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,667
(coos)

324
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,592
No, thank coo!

325
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,297
(sighs)

326
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,854
-(door opens, bell dings)
-Ah, finally-- a customer!

327
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,766
-Aah!
-Simpson, why aren't you at work?

328
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,018
Whoa, hold that famous temper, Smithers.

329
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,100
Who is this?

330
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,776
Simpson, introduce me
to this almond-eyed beauty,

331
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,278
and all is forgiven.

332
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,610
Uh, Mr. Burns, I'd like you to meet...

333
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,655
Mother Hubbard standee.

334
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,779
From the Wisconsin Standees!

335
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,286
Milk-fed, yet so slim.

336
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,789
Permit me to play you a tune
on my mouth organ.

337
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:00,044
-Sir, maybe we should go.
-Sorry you died!

338
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,125
Put the body with the others.

339
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,971
Whew.

340
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,549
Homer, if I ever seem that senile,
get a gun and...

341
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,756
What are you doing with that gun?!

342
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,347
Marge, have you ever
seen pants do this?

343
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,433
(gasps)

344
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,438
You're working so hard
you've lost weight!

345
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,231
We're killing ourselves trying to run
a restaurant no one goes to.

346
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,736
I've never said this to you before,
but I'm saying it now.

347
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,860
I'm going to Moe's.

348
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,777
(gasps)

349
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,540
Now I know why you come here so much.

350
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,159
No matter how sad you are inside,

351
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,367
what you see looks worse.

352
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,957
Yeah. It was really hard for me
to make this place

353
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,173
look old but not in any way comfortable.

354
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,264
Now maybe some TV will cheer you up.

355
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,801
<i>If you's in the mood for a sammich,</i>

356
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:53,603
<i>come on down to Mother Hubbard's</i>
<i>Sandwich Cupboard Express,</i>

357
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,929
<i>for all the sandwiches you love!</i>

358
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,095
{\an8}<i>Bread sammich.</i>

359
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,602
{\an8}<i>Yesterday's what's-it with ketchup.</i>

360
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,895
{\an8}<i>And the thing what ate our chickens.</i>

361
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,399
{\an8}<i>BRANDINE:</i>
<i>Looks like a fox, but it ain't.</i>

362
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:08,401

363
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,895
{\an8}<i>(banjo plays)</i>

364
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,777
Aw! "Yesterday's what's-it"?

365
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,445
Why does everyone go to them?

366
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,123
It's express, Marge.

367
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,161
Yeah, with our busy lifestyle,
we got to have express.

368
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,090
Aw. Listen there, Midge.

369
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,709
I know how to get yous
out of your contract.

370
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,256
But I got to warn you...

371
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,129
you will never work
in the fast-food industry again.

372
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,297
Go on. Please.

373
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,641
MARGE:
So, you see, Ms. Zengler,

374
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,183
the Mother Hubbard's Express
across the street

375
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,267
is stealing all our business.

376
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,732
It's not fair.

377
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,362
If you want fairness,
work at a Sunglass Hut.

378
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,400
This is the sandwich game.

379
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,074
I don't understand you.

380
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,572
I grew up in the pageant system.

381
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,493
Oh. Now I completely understand you.

382
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,203
I'm a litigious businessman,

383
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,504
and I need a coffee to go.

384
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,408
One jumbo joe to go!

385
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,336
-(yells in pain)
-Get the first-aid kit!

386
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,669
One Florence Nightingale in a box!
And make it snappy!

387
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,335
{\an8}Ow!

388
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,045
{\an8}I got this.

389
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,345
{\an8}Ow!

390
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,348
Oh, why do these things happen
to innocent victims?

391
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,351
I was just about to become

392
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,773
a million-dollar crotch model!

393
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:26,442
Hey, hey, hey!
It's not corporate's fault!

394
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,522
Really?

395
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,856
{\an8}But the franchise agreement
says Mother Hubbard Inc.

396
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,532
{\an8}would provide adequate training
for all employees, which they didn't.

397
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,372
{\an8}Clause 27C-3.

398
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,328
(scoffs)
You actually read this thing?

399
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:41,698
It was written by two lawyers
who had to keep waking the other one up.

400
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,117
If you'll just give me back
my original investment,

401
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,417
I'll take full responsibility
for this man's injuries.

402
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:52,462
Please... tell me I'm still beautiful!

403
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,588
All right, Marge.
You've got a deal.

404
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,635
Well, family, we should be proud.

405
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:05,193
We took on corporate America
and broke even.

406
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,439
Hear, hear!

407
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,274
(panting) Sir?

408
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:11,685
I-I think we've gone far enough
to dispose of the body.

409
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,235
Dispose? Ooh.

410
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,988
I've come here to pitch woo.
