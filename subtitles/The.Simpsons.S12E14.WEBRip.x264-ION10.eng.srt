{\an8}Marge, after a lot of thought

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,420
{\an8}I've decided to run
the Springfield Marathon.

31
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,134
{\an8}Oh, please, you get exhausted

32
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,545

{\an8}You got that right.

36
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,137
{\an8}Well, Dad, I think
running's good exercise.

37
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,894
{\an8}It adds years to your life.

38
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,096
{\an8}Stay out of this, Lisa.

39
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,306
{\an8}Marge, I've made up my mind.

40
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,686
{\an8}I'll do your job for a day

41
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:28,772
{\an8}and you do mine.

42
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,357

Jebediah Springfield ran

47
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,463
{\an8}across six states to avoid
his creditors.

48
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,591
{\an8}You got all your equipment,
Dad?

49
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,458
{\an8}Let's see. Sweat band... check.

check, check and check.

{\an8}Attention, runners:
on your mark, get set...

52
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,675
{\an8}Now, get out of here
before I change my mind.

53
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,524
{\an8}I can't believe it!

54
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,022
{\an8}I'm actually
running a marathon!

55
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,153
{\an8}Oh, I hit the wall!

56
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,690
{\an8}This is so painful!

57
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,193
{\an8}Hey, I got my second wind!

58
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,106
{\an8}D'oh! Another wall!

59
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,735
{\an8}Woo-hoo! Third wind!

60
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,365
{\an8}Faster, rickshaw driver,
faster!

61
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,779
{\an8}Ow!
Sir, the whip isn't helping.

62
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,368
{\an8}Silence!
You call yourself Chinese?

63
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,921
{\an8}No one can outrun the Flash.

64
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,627
{\an8}Curses, one of my superfoes
has set a trap for me.

{\an8}Hey, Grandpa's running.

68
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,426
{\an8}That's not Grandpa.

69
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,100
{\an8}Dad's just dehydrated.

70
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,889

And with 500 yards to go

{\an8}the runners from Australia
and Djibouti are neck and neck.

74
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,864
{\an8}Two weary warriors now burning
with pain and exhaustion

75
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,323
{\an8}but only one will win
the grand prize:

76
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,953
{\an8}a walking tour of Springfield.

77
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,161
{\an8}(both panting)

78
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,747
(chuckles) That tour is mine.

79
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:06,748
(chuckling)

80
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,419
Well, hold the phone, Dora.

81
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,829
A new challenger
has emerged out of nowhere.

82
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,128
He's running on shear pluck,
moxie and grit

83
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,382
all of which he'll be
tested for after the race.

84
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,215
(Italian accent)
Hey, I win the race.

85
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,340
Viva Italia!

86
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,597
Folks, our winner seems
to be from Italy.

87
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,720
I love-a you all.

88
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,144
I use up all-a my English.

89
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,316

91
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,566
He's a phony!

92
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,822
Lousy cheater!

93
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,993
I demand a re-race.

94
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,872
I got a better idea.

95
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,199
Let's have a fun run
on his trachea.

96
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,235
-Yeah.
-Kill him!

97
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,577
Make him pay!

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,580
(tires screeching)

99
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,455
Get in, hurry!

BART: Mob... stranger?

101
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,169
Mob... stranger. Stranger.

102
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,179

103
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,089

104
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,177
Who are you?

105
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,642
Oh, you'll find out
in due time.

106
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,103
Well, it says here

107
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,642
your name is L.T. Smash.

108
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,886
The time has come.

109
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,187
I'm L.T. Smash.

110
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,073
Thank you so much
for saving our son

111
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,820
from that murderous mob.

112
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,491
Well, thank you for letting me
chill in your crib.

113
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,451
And thank <i>you</i>
for assuming we're hip.

114
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,452
All right.
Now here's the 4-1-1.

115
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,164
I'm a record producer, see?

116
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,044
I'm starting a new boy band

117
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,751
and there's a place
in it for Bart.

118
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,791
My Bart?

119
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,424
Oh, yeah. That stunt he pulled
at the race shows me

120
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,801
he's the bad boy
I'm looking for.

121
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,919
(chuckles)

122
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,665
Now listen to me, Smash.

123
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,337
We're not signing anything
unless it's a contract.

124
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,637
Why do you want Bart?

125
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,470
He's not much of a singer.

126
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:51,015
Marge, it's not the singing
that brings in the Sacajaweas.

127
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,400
Bart's a rebel, and that's
what I need for my new band

128
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,689
the Party Posse.

129
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,282
Now hold on.
I have some concerns.

130
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,319
Please, Mom,

131
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,531
my dream is to be a rock star.

132
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,912
And my dream
is to get rid of Bart.

133
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,699
-But...
-How many lives must you ruin?

134
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,124
Oh, OK.

135
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,038
Bart, I want you to meet
and greet the other members

136
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,047
of the Party Posse.

137
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,088
He's smart, he's soulful,

138
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,882
he's Milhouse.

139
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,215
What up, G Money?

140
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,010
Next, he'll break your nose,

141
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,554
your glasses, and your heart,

142
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,677
Nelson.

143
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,143
{\an8}Wait, these are just guys
from school.

144
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,104
Who's next, Ralph Wiggum?

145
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,194
Whee! I'm a pop sensation.

146
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,730
And I'm the mack daddy
behind such groups as

147
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,395
New Kids in the Ditch
and Boy-nudo.

148
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,614
I'm going to make you stars.

149
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:46,034
{\an8}Sneer, sneer.

150
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,414
{\an8}Two, three, four, and thrust,

151
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,201
{\an8}and grab yourself right there.

152
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,995
{\an8}Now let go and flirt.

153
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,159
{\an8}You call that a flirt?

154
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,208
{\an8}I'm not melting!

155
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,541
OK, your tunes are fly,

156
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,337
and your threads are dope

157
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,381
All that's left is the singing.

158
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,764
"Party Posse,

159

160
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,434
{\an8}Isn't this song
a little boastful?

161
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,773
{\an8}No one told me
there was gonna be boasting.

162
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,059

177
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,811
So, from now on anything
caught in your zipper

178
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,567
will be handled
by the school nurse and not me.

179
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:07,989
And now are you adequately
prepared to rock?

180
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,110
(all cheering)

181
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,198
{\an8}Silence!

182
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,615
Here they are, the Party Posse.

183
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,292
Hello, Springfield!

184
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,745
Now here's a song

185
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,165
that your Principal Skinner
doesn't want us to play.

186
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,094
ALL: Boo!

187
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,383
That's not true!

188
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,926
This assembly was my idea.

189
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,389
I like your brand
of inoffensive pop rock.

190
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,470
Screw you, man!

191
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,064
We're going to play it anyway!

192
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,889
(all cheering)

193
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:37,934
Mmm.

194
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,187

Oh, man, they're going

204
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,689
And you stood in their way.

205
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,939
No, I didn't.

206
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,570
I even came in early
and made orange drink.

207
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,648
Orange drink?

208
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,402
What, do you live
with your mama?

209
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,944
She's lives with <i>me.</i>

210
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,857
{\an8}(audience cheering)

211
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,413
I can't believe it.
They loved us.

212
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,543
I'm wearing a bathrobe
and I'm not even sick.

213
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,621
Yo, dudes! Awesome show.

214
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,594
(gasp) It's 'N Sync!

215
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:51,298

216
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,472
Word.

217
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,010
{\an8}What brings you to Springfield?

218
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,353
We saw your band formation
notice in the paper.

219
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,139
{\an8}Really? You saw our BFN?

220
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,472
I can't believe
I'm meeting Milhouse.

221
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,518
Word.

222
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,641
(grunt)

223
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,267
So, anyway, we brought you
this wicked gift basket.

224
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,274
Stubble glitter,
a crowd taser...

225
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,356
{\an8}"Crowd taser"?

226
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,901
Yeah, it's perfect

227
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,994
for getting through the fans
to your limousine.

228
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,899
(grunts) Yo!

229
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,658
-(watch alarm beeps)
-Dudes, we got to go.

230
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,700
Our clothes are getting
a little out of date.

231
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,493
To the Bandanna Republic!

232
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,487

(driving pop rock playing)

234
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,883
Now we got to send them
a basket.

235
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,005
BART: Oh, yeah,
that's the spot.

236
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,168
(groans)

237
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,467
That is perfect.

238
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,930
Mom, can't Bart get his
massage somewhere else?

239
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,472
Don't be selfish, Lisa.

240
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,715
Will you two shut up?

241
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,386
I'm missing
precious VJ prattle.

242
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:48,106
Whoo! That was the latest ad
for Stridex Pads, medicated.

243
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,519
OK, coming at you

244
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:53,567

It doesn't mean anything.

None of those girls

291
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,610
{\an8}The government's putting
subliminal messages in your videos.

292
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,283
Subliminal messages?

293
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,992
Do you have any idea
how insane that sounds?

294
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,867
Is that a Navy tattoo?

295
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:51,121
A Navy tattoo? Do you have any
idea how insane that sounds?

296

297
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,341
<i>Lieutenant </i>Smash.

298
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,553
Yeah, that's right.

299
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,763
Lieutenant L.T. Smash.

300
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,010
A wig!

301
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,178
But... but your pant legs...

302
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:19,069
Oh! How could you soil the good
name of Star Blitzzz Promotions?

303
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,439
Oh, come on, Lisa.

304
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,816
We've always used pop stars
to recruit people...

305
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,283
going back to Elvis.

306
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,203
Then there was
<i>Sergeant Pepper's,</i>

307
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,202
the Captain & Tennille,

308
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,164
and the Kiss army.

309
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,374
But you have recruiting ads
on TV.

310
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,464
Why do you need
subliminal messages?

311
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,250
It's a three-pronged attack...

312
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,093
subliminal, liminal,
and super-liminal.

313
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,209
Super-liminal?

314
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,756
I'll show you.

315
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,919
Hey, you! Join the Navy!

316
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,088
-Uh... yeah, all right.
-I'm in.

317
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,796
Now that you know, Lisa,

318
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,967
I'm afraid
I can't let you leave.

319
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,103
Oh.

320
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:58,113
Wait a minute. Bart's band
is brainwashing kids

321
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,858
with subliminal messages?

322
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,940
That's pretty far-fetched,
Lisa.

323
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,276
Are you sure someone
hasn't been bitten

324
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,951
by the jealousy bug?

325
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,740
(laughs) Here comes
the jealousy bug!

326
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,164

-Hey!

327
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,452
{\an8}-Gonna get you!
-Hey!

328
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,495
Cut it out. You're a grown man.

329
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,919
(gasps) I want to go home now.

330
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,828
Nobody's going home.

331
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,037
We're going to see
Bart's concert.

332
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,302
{\an8}LISA: An aircraft carrier?

333
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,920
{\an8}Oh, that's subtle.

Well, there's no easy way
to say this,

374
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,666
the new administration is
shutting down Project Boy Band.

375
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,045
Shutting it down?

376

Permission to say,
"That's crazy," sir?

Pop music's hard work.

Well, boys,
the Party Posse is over

457
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,169
but at least I saved you
from a public spoofing.

458
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,880
Aw, man!

459
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,632
We could have been
on the cover of <i>Mad.</i>

460
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,383
They called me "Smelson."

"Smelson."

464
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,850

467
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,390
I could have thought of that.

468
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,017
Sure you could have.

469

474

475
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,412
