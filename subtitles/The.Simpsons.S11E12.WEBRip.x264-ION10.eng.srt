{\an8}Springfield community!

25
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,119
{\an8}This is my year, Marge.

26
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,452
Everyone knows I'm what
makes this city great!

27
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,158
{\an8}I don't know. There's a lot of buzz

28
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,248
{\an8}around Lenny.

29
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,287
{\an8}Our first Springfield Pride Award

30
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,458
{\an8}goes to a local legend.

31
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,047
{\an8}A man who brings laughter and joy

32
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,763
{\an8}to the children of Springfield.

33
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,510
{\an8}With his big red nose and baggy pants...

34
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,425
{\an8}-BROCKMAN: Krusty the Clown!
-Hey, hey!

35
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,854
{\an8}-(applause)
-What?

36
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,522
{\an8}-Who are you?
-Seat filler.

37
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,691
{\an8}Aw...

38
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,990
{\an8}Everyone gets an award, but me.

39
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:39,452
{\an8}I can't help it if I donated
the most blood.

40
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:43,624
{\an8}Oh, I'm feeling kind of woozy. (groans)

41
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,668
{\an8}Oh, why won't anyone give me an award?

42
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,052
{\an8}You won a Grammy.

43
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,089
{\an8}I mean an award that's worth winning.

44
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,311
{\an8}You know, Kent, in today's
youth-obsessed culture,

45
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,105
{\an8}we sometimes forget that
older people are still alive.

46
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,730
{\an8}I told ya!

47
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,146
{\an8}Well, <i>sorry </i>!

48
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,029
{\an8}And that's why our final award
honors a man

49
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:21,283
{\an8}who's lived in Springfield for 108 years.

50
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,867
{\an8}Our oldest resident,

51
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,582
-Cornelius Chapman!
-(applause)

52
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,166
SPEARS: Cornelius Chapman
built the first log cabin

53
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,379
in Springfield

54
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,839
and introduced the toothbrush

55
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,879
-to our fair city.
-(people exclaiming)

56
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,883
BROCKMAN: For years, he was Springfield's

57
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,296
only basketball player,

58
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,764
but he still managed

59
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,974
-to entertain the crowd.
-(cheering)

60
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,135
SPEARS: In the market crash of 1929,

61
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,024
he helped people jump out
of windows to avoid disgrace.

62
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,391
You're doing the right thing.

63
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,558
Oh-oh, out you go!

64
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,856
-Oh!
-(chuckling)

65
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,319
My! You're a big one!

66
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,108
No-no. No turning back now.

67
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,742
Off a tall building!
That's a great way to do it!

68
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,449
And in 1935, our honoree

69
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,490
took a bullet for Huey Long.

70
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,950
(groans)

71
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,253
-No!
-(groans)

72
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,328
And now, Springfield's oldest citizen...

73
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,214
He is, like, totally venerable.

74
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,421
-Cornelius Chapman!
-(applause)

75
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,336
-Mwah!
-(gagging)

76
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,763
(all gasp)

77
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,090
Well, guess we should've

78
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,425
expected that.

79
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,929
Well, this award has to go to somebody.

80
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:28,774
Would everyone, who is 60 or older,
please stand up?

81
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,898
Over 80?

82
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,321
Ninety?

83
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,322
One hundred years old?

84
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,740
Homer, sit down!

85
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,372
-What's that, sonny?
-(growling)

86
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,739
(cheering)

87
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,923
Well, this is all so sudden.

88
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,879
Ah! Don't give me that kiss of death,

89
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,959
you black widow!

90
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,879
Argh! Ah! Boy, he didn't want
to let go of that!

91
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,853
OK, let's see.
I don't have a speech prepared,

92
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:04,888
but, uh...

93
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,311
Abracadaver!

94
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,060
"Thank you all so much.

95
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,234
I love Springfield

96
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,811
from the cuddliest infant to the...

97
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,065
(whispering) puppies, patriotism...

98
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,150
bluebirds."

99
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,895
I'm not reading this drivel.

100
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,897
This speech is over.

101
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,158
(sparse applause)

102
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,448
(grunting)

103
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,955
Well, that was a great night for us all!

104
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,209
That's not an award.

105
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,080
That's part of the set.

106
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,707
Nothing you can say
will diminish this honor.

107
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,708
(grunting)

108
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,884
(sighs) Now that I'm

109
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,547
the town's oldest man,
I'm starting to realize

110
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,466
I'm not a young man anymore!

111
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,015
I'll have to start taking
better care of myself.

112
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,189
You know, I haven't had
a medicine-o checkup in ages.

113
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,688
Sir, you deserve the finest
doctors in the world.

114
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,941
I'm taking you to the Mayo Clinic
in Minnesota.

115
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,533
Very well, but I'll need someone
to watch my house.

116
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,860
Who's that fella who always
screws up and creates havoc?

117
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:04,986
Homer Simpson, sir?

118
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,946
Yes! The way I figure it,

119
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,954
he's due for a good performance.

120
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,036
(groaning)

121
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:17,377
Now, if the house catches fire,
I want you to call this number.

122
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,300
Uh-huh. The fire department.

123
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,299
Yes. They're new, but they're good.

124
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,631
Sir, we should get going.

125
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,302
Don't worry about a thing.

126
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,216
We'll take good care of your house.

127
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,854
HOMER: Look at me!

128
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,732
I'm a billionaire!

129
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,596
(yelling)

130
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,024
I forgot my...

131
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,726
(chuckling)

132
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,026
Good Lord!

133
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,663
This bedroom is as big as our house.

134
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,910
And the bed never needs to be made.

135
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:50,992
Check it out.

136
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,543
(chuckling and gasping)

137
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,633
Hmm. Seems a little wasteful.

138
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,838
Wasteful <i>and </i>practical.

139
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,838
A mechanical dressing dealy.

140
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,012
Watch this, Marge.

141
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,384
(gears grinding)

142
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,466
Oh! Oh! Ow! Oh, no! Oh!

143
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,553
(bell dings)

144
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,892
Now I'm ready to hit the town.

145
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,484
Hmm.

146
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,317
(chuckles)

147
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,446
(tumblers click)

148
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,868
-Close that door.
-(Bart screams)

149
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,415
Wow! He's got every Nancy Drew.

150
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,629
Even the controversial <i>Clue In The Clock.</i>

151
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,341
Tsk-tsk-tsk, so many swears.

152
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,302
(panting)

153
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,683
I'm Al Unser Jr.!

154
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,969
-I'm Princess Margaret!
-(horse neighing)

155
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,683
I'm drunk!

156
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,103
(groaning)

157
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,146
It's nothing serious.
Just lay off the chili

158
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,571
-and you should be fine.
-(laughing)

159
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,200
Don't you laugh, Fidel.
I've been in the car with you.

160
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,359
Let's see. Social security number:

161
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,698
Naught-naught-naught... Naught-naught...

162
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,243
Naught-naught-naught-two.

163
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,910
(whispers) Damn Roosevelt!

164
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,496
Cause of parents' death, got in my way.

165
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,089
Mom, Bart's making faces at me!

166
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:33,677
-I think.
-Look how loud I have to yell!

167
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,393
This all seems a little elaborate
for sloppy joes.

168
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,555
Hmm. I know what
the other 11 forks are for,

169
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,395
but what do you do with this one?

170
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,980
Why, Marge, I believe

171
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,065
you're supposed to scratch
your ass with it.

172
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,440
Homer, watch your lang--

173
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:51,197
Oh! That's a lifesaver!

174
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,331
Man, this is living!

175
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,867
Hmm. Stop that!

176
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,167
Cigars are for rich people
and legendary comedians,

177
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,752
like Bill Crosby and David Letterson.

178
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,967
(humming)

179
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,548
Oops! Forgot to swirl it.

180
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,312
Homer, did you jimmy open
Mr. Burns's liquor cabinet?

181
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,979
"Jimmy" is such an ugly word, Marge,

182
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,232
Unless you're talking about Jimmy Smits.

183
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,600
(sexy growl)

184
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,937
But house-sitting is a sacred... Hey!

185
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,772
MARGE: Stop swirling, Homer.

186
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:30,437
Listen, I worked <i>long</i>
and hard for this place,

187
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,528
and no one's going
to take it away from me.

188
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,533
Not you, not its rightful owner,

189
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,905
not anybody.

190
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,873
And another thing, if I ev--

191
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,594
Operator, get me Thailand.

192
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,088
T-I... And so on.

193
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,129
Homer, who are you calling?

194
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,797
Everybody. I found Burnsy's address book.

195
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,176
I called the New York Yankees
and told them to bunt.

196
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,144
And then I called the Queen of England
and asked her

197
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,854
how it was going. And then, I--

198
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,274
Well, don't run up Mr. Burns' phone bill.

199
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,813
Just a second, Marge. Hello, Thailand?

200
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,397
How's everything on your end?

201
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,447
Uh-huh. That's some language
you got there.

202
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:16,198
And you talk like that 24/7, huh? Hey!

203
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,242
Homer, you've got to stop
pretending this is your house.

204
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,447
You're <i>not </i>a billionaire.

205
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,077
Geez, way to burst my bubble, Marge.

206
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,915
All I'm saying is don't get
too comfortable.

207
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,001
Mr. Burns will be back tomorrow.

208
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,626
Marge, you're right.

209
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,303
We <i>do </i>have to have a party.

210
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,721
Party? No. No parties.

211
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,551
What about "partays"?

212
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,347
No partays, no shindigs,

213
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,770
no keggers, no hootenannies,

214
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:41,928
no mixers, no raves,

215
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,136
-no box socials.
-Damn!

216
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,225
And I looked so good on that bike.

217
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,822
Now, doctor, I want you to test me

218
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,071
for everything...
Every disease on this chart.

219
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,618
Fine. We'll just start
by drawing some blood.

220
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,834
Well, isn't that odd? It's like poking

221
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,501
-through meringue.
-Oh, try this arm.

222
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,420
I saw some blood in there the other day.

223
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,052
Come on, keep blowing.

224
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,762
OK, 12 centimeters. Excellent!

225
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,471
I'm a big boy!

226
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,894
(machine whirring)

227
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,073
-There's your problem.
-(growls)

228
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,698
(snarls)

229
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,609
(Moe humming)

230
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,948
Having a party, Moe. I'll need four kegs

231
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,043
of your finest imported-sounding beer.

232
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,460
How about Tuborg,
the beer of Danish kings?

233
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,170
Mm! Danish.

234
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,591
Now, you know I can't sell you
no beer till 2:00 p.m.

235
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,880
on account of it's Sunday.

236
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,133
Huh? If you can't sell beer,

237
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,925
what are Lenny and Carl doing here?

238
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,888
Huh? Oh, we're just watching
the sun move across the sky.

239
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,637
{\an8}When it gets to here, we can drink again.

240
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,563
But I need that beer now.

241
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,231
Sorry, 2:00 p.m.

242
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,935
Or you can steal a boat

243
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,729
and sail out to international waters.

244
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,483
{\an8}-Huh!
-What's that, a theme park?

245
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,320
No. The ocean.

246
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,740
Once you get 12 miles out,

247
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,698
there's no laws. That's where they held

248
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,358
the Tyson-Secretariat fight.

249
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,777
HOMER: He-he. They were so drunk.

250
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,489
Gentlemen, get off your knees.

251
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,077
Your rich uncle, Homer,

252
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,662
is throwing the wildest Box Social

253
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,378
the high seas have ever seen!

254
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,295
And you're invited.

255
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,759
Yeah! All right!

256
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,433
(yelling)

257
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,258
Oh, no, you don't.

258
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,263
I'm not going to let
you trash Mr. Burns' yacht.

259
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,096
Marge, you know I normally listen to you,

260
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,733
but I got to seize this opportunity...

261
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,610
Just in case I never become
a real billionaire.

262
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:57,068
Oh, Homie, I don't care
if you're a billionaire.

263
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,241
-I love you because...
-Hey, there's another way

264
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,860
-to get on the boat!
-Whoo-hoo!

265
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,866
(laughing)

266
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,543
Propellers... spinning!

267
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,908
Turn... left!

268
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,667
Boat go... there!

269
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,419
(all cheering)

270
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,253
{\an8}Don't worry, Mom. I'm sure he'll be OK.

271
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,877
The boat's going sideways.

272
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,934
-HOMER: Chips ahoy!
-(all cheering)

273
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:24,848
Well done, Mr. Lenny! Well done.

274
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,135
Homer, have we hit
international waters yet?

275
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,187
Because, uh, things are getting real ugly.

276
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,860
I can't sell you beer
till we cross the line!

277
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,241
Legally, you could give us free beer.

278
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,073
Ow!

279
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,108
Could you give us rubbing alcohol

280
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,198
for our wounds?

281
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,703
Hey. Ha-ha-ha. Sucker!

282
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
Ow!

283
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,383
We made it, son!

284
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,961
International waters,

285
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,086
the land that law forgot.

286
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,965
-(music playing)
-(laughing)

287
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,050
Yee-haw!

288
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,809
Yahoo!

289
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,181
(bull bellows)

290
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,730
Wow, you can do anything out here!

291
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,981
That's right.

292
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,312
See that ship over there?

293
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,767
They're rebroadcasting

294
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,567
major league baseball with implied

295
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,990
oral consent.
Not expressed written consent.

296
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,032
Or so the legend goes.

297
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,494
Darr... I now pronounce ya...

298
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,076
man and cow.

299
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,579
(glass breaking)

300
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,583
Please accept these

301
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,874
illegal fireworks

302
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,247
with my blessing.

303
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,383
(chuckling) Yarr...

304
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,625
There are no laws.

305
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,546
We can do anything we want. Anything.

306
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,795
Ow! Ow!

307
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,758
Oh, real mature, Lenny.

308
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,644
Well, doc, I think I did pretty well
on my tests.

309
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,937
You may shake my hand if you like.

310
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,061
Well, under the circumstances,
I'd rather not.

311
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,148
-Eh?
-Mr. Burns I'm afraid

312
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,443
you are the sickest man
in the United States.

313
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,777
You have everything.

314
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,362
-You mean I have pneumonia?
-Yes.

315
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,947
{\an8}-Juvenile diabetes?
-Yes.

316
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,582
{\an8}-Hysterical pregnancy?
-A little bit, yes.

317
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,039
You also have several diseases

318
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,159
that have just been discovered... in you.

319
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,206
I see. You sure you just haven't made

320
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,460
thousands of mistakes?

321
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,421
Uh, no. No, I'm afraid not.

322
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,051
{\an8}-This sounds like <i>bad </i>news.
-Well, you'd think so,

323
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,879
but all of your diseases
are in perfect balance.

324
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,755
I-If you have a moment, I can explain.

325
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,052
-Well!
-Here's the door

326
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,465
to your body, you see?

327
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:32,353
And these are over-sized novelty germs.

328
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,601
Uh, that's influenza, that's bronchitis.

329
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,233
And this cute little cuddle bug
Is pancreatic cancer.

330
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,651
Ah! Here's what happens when they all try

331
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,190
to get through the door at once.

332
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,362
(imitates the Three Stooges grunts)

333
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,443
Move it, chowderhead!

334
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,951
We call it "Three Stooges Syndrome."

335
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,070
So what you're saying is...

336
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,617
I'm indestructible.

337
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,080
Oh, no, no. In fact,

338
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,620
even a slight breeze could--

339
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,083
Indestructible.

340
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,799
Why are we cleaning this room?

341
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,799
I don't think we were even in here.

342
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,091
Honey, we want Mr. Burns
to find this place

343
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,715
exactly the way he left it.

344
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,640
(humming)

345
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,813
(gasps)

346
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,061
(humming)

347
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:25,073
-(music playing)
-(all laughing and cheering)

348
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,534
Look at those poor saps back on land

349
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,991
with their "laws and ethics."

350
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,622
They'll never know the simple joys

351
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,200
of a monkey knife fight.

352
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,834
Give it to him boy! Give it to him!

353
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,791
-(monkey chattering)
-(all encouraging)

354
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,134
MOE: Thrust! Parry!

355
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,248
Stab, stab, stab, stab!

356
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,634
-(Moe laughing)

{\an8}Hey, you're in the net, too.

420
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,709
I said, "Shut up, net face."

421
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,090
Aw, we're going to die,

422
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,919
Ah, you didn't miss much.

423
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,174
Honeydew is the money melon.

424
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,336
And now, we will cut you loose.

425
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,427

That was my plan all along.

430
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:55,485
Now, relax and the currents
will take us home.

00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,319
What about the people on the bottom?

434
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,656
OK, it stopped.

435
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,620
It looks great!
I can't believe we scrubbed

436
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:12,337
that old-man smell out of 137 rooms.

437
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,669
Smithers, old chum, there's nothing like
coming home

with a clean bill of health.

439
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,215
Oh, and sorry about your news.

-Thank you, sir.
-Do they know how many eggs

441
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,604
it laid in your brain?

442
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,888
I prefer not to know.

443
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,141
Frankly, one is too many.

444
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,929
Ugh!

445
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,557

Well, let's see.

What?

453
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,910
Well, I suppose some mishaps
are unavoidable.

What have they done
to your beautiful face?

458
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,879
Oh... There, there.

459
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,296
Smithers, this monkey's going
to need most of your skin.

460

(groans)

461
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,564
Ah! It's good to be home.

462
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,689
I don't know. After living
like a billionaire,

463
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,770
this place is kind of a dump.

464
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,225
Ah, it's not so bad.

465
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,725
Here we can spit on the floor.

466
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,194
Bart, stop that!

467
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,948
Now, we may not have antique furniture

468
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,910
or priceless artwork,

469
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,451
but we have everything we need right here.

470
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,785
That's right.

471
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,539
Just because we're not rich

472
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,671
doesn't mean that we don't have...
