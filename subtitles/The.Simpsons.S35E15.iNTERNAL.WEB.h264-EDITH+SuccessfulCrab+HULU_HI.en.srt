at 6:00 a.m. here.

00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:17,217
Thank you, Moe.

6
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:18,620
And thank you, pro football,

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,194
for playing your worst games
every year in London.

8
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:23,998
Yeah, the games start so early,

9
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,937
now we can spend Sunday morning
as God intended...

10
00:00:27,037 --> 00:00:29,308

Welcome back to Wembley Stadium

13
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:35,454
where the score at the interval

14
00:00:35,554 --> 00:00:37,959
is Jacksonville Jaguars 25,

15
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:40,196
Buffalo Williams nil.

16
00:00:40,296 --> 00:00:42,735
Oh, boy, I got 100 quid
on the Jag-u-ars,

17
00:00:42,802 --> 00:00:44,505
and I don't even know
how much that is.

18
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:46,509
I'm Buffalo all the way.

19
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:48,647
Ten bob, six shillings, baby.

20
00:00:48,747 --> 00:00:50,952
You know, I've dabbled
in a lot of anonymouses

21
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:51,954
but never gambling.

22
00:00:52,054 --> 00:00:54,125
I always thought
betting was for class acts,

23
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:56,997
like, uh, James Bond
or Pete Rose

24
00:00:57,097 --> 00:00:58,399
or Secretariat.

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,270
Why don't you give it a try,
Moseph?

26
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,975
Yeah, make one little bet
on the next game.

27
00:01:03,076 --> 00:01:04,211
Baltimore-Detroit.

28
00:01:04,278 --> 00:01:05,681
It's harmless fun.

29
00:01:05,747 --> 00:01:09,155
Uh, uh, all right,
I guess I could bet a buck.

30
00:01:09,221 --> 00:01:11,091
That's nothing
to get too worked up about.

[announcer] And we are underway
here in Baltimore,

36
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:24,685
as the Ravens take on
the Detroit Lions.

37
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:26,389
Beautiful day for football.

38
00:01:26,522 --> 00:01:28,125
...and Detroit scores!

Touchdown Baltimore!

42
00:01:33,036 --> 00:01:34,672
...and Detroit is coming back.

43
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:36,709
Baltimore retakes the lead.

44

either way.

46
00:01:41,553 --> 00:01:43,489
Baltimore just might
pull it out.

Oh, my God, I'm gonna win!

all my life.

Oh, but what's this?

50
00:01:49,702 --> 00:01:52,007
Detroit scores
a last-second safety

51
00:01:52,074 --> 00:01:54,545
and the Lions are victorious.

52
00:01:54,645 --> 00:01:57,919
De-who scores an un-what
and the wheres are wha-torious?

53

Geez. Tough luck, Moe.

54
00:01:59,756 --> 00:02:00,490
You lost.

00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,993

Uh, calm down, Moe.

59
00:02:08,072 --> 00:02:09,308
It was just a dollar.

60
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:10,577
To you it was just a dollar!

61
00:02:10,644 --> 00:02:12,714
To me it was a whole simoleon!
All right?!

62
00:02:12,747 --> 00:02:14,118
Get the hell out of here!
All of youse!

Guys, I think Larry's...

70
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:32,287
...dead.

[organ playing]

72
00:02:35,427 --> 00:02:36,930
I don't know
why we had to come here.

Funerals are stupid.

You're all excused
from coming to mine.

Good. I had something
that day anyway.

76

I didn't have anything that day.

77
00:02:44,345 --> 00:02:46,449
Homie, you have to pay
your respects.

78
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:49,155
You spent more time with Larry
than your own kids.

79
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:50,490
That's not true at all.

What's my favorite subject?

in the world?

How old am I?
And what color's my bike?

83
00:02:56,502 --> 00:02:59,308
Pass. Pass. Crackle
from Snap, Crackle, and Pop.

84
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,178
Pass. And trick question...

85
00:03:01,278 --> 00:03:03,683
you have a skateboard.

86
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:07,691
Huh. I'm strangely comforted
by the passes.

87

[Marge]
Wow, light turnout.

88
00:03:14,605 --> 00:03:17,244
I'm so glad
you guys could make it.

89
00:03:17,311 --> 00:03:18,313
How could we not?

90
00:03:18,346 --> 00:03:20,050
Larry was... around.

91
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,855
So we just throw some money
into this tip jar here?

92
00:03:22,922 --> 00:03:25,995
What's the right amount?
One? Five?

93
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:26,997
One?

94
00:03:27,097 --> 00:03:28,333
This is gonna take a while.

95
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:30,336

you saw us through so much,

triumph and sorrow,

109
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:05,908
and it's a comfort to know
that you died at 92

110
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:07,244
of natural causes.

111
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:08,513
Natural causes?

112
00:04:08,613 --> 00:04:11,251

from the vaccine!

You shut up,

You're an embarrassment
to this family.

Who are we doing today?

A sad, balding drunk

120
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:28,119
- who hung out at Moe's.
- Got it.

121
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:33,296
Homer Simpson was a beloved
pillar of this community.

122

He thinks you died.

123
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:36,335
Do something.

124
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:38,173
Why? He's saying nice things.

125
00:04:38,273 --> 00:04:39,943
You never call me a pillar.

Uh... anyhoo,

131
00:04:56,342 --> 00:05:01,854
Well, my Lawrence always talked
about his best friends,

132

the fellows at Moe's Tavern.

133
00:05:04,658 --> 00:05:07,664
It would warm my heart
if they came up

134
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:11,605
and shared fond memories
of my son.

135
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:14,311
[quietly]
I'm not talking. You talk.

136
00:05:14,378 --> 00:05:15,714
- I didn't know him.
- No one did.

137
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:17,318
Your stool was closest.

138
00:05:18,086 --> 00:05:22,327
Perhaps one of you could talk
about Larry's love of fishing.

139
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:24,397
Uh, uh, one time,

140
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:26,602
we went
to this great fishing lake.

141
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:27,906
Lake Fish.

142
00:05:27,972 --> 00:05:30,911
Oh, yeah.
Fish Lake was full of...

143
00:05:32,147 --> 00:05:33,049
...fish.

144
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:36,155
You know who always caught
the biggest fish?

145
00:05:36,222 --> 00:05:37,290
Who? Who?

146
00:05:37,357 --> 00:05:39,763
I-I, uh... I want to say Larry?

147
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:41,198
[chuckles]
Big Fish Larry.

148
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:42,734
Oh, yeah. Larry, indeed.

What a true story.

- Oof.
- Why did you never take the time

152
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,454
to get to know this man?

153
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,757
Hey, at least we came, huh?

154
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:55,693
Hey, Barney totally blew this
off.

more important to do.

into our band of bros.

The four of us
are closer than close.

Yeah, we're like

except, uh, super gross.

165
00:06:20,743 --> 00:06:23,449
Yeah, Larry just wasn't part
of our deal.

166
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,754
Because you never asked him
to be.

167
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:29,528
All he ever wanted was
a simple human connection.

168
00:06:29,594 --> 00:06:34,371
But, instead,
he died unloved in a bar.
