(grunts)

348
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,528
Why, you little... (grunts)

349
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,834
Dad, no!
You're gonna strangle a baby!

350
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,578
(gasps) Oh, my God.
That would've been horrible.

351
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,371
-Why, you little... (grunts)
-(chokes)

352
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,714
turning... a sweet little baby...

353
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,170
-into a you! (grunts)
-(Bart continues choking)

354
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,131
Bart, you're a great kid,

355
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,751
but if I had another one like you,

356
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,588
I'd hang myself from a highway overpass.

357
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,514
Please, give your sister
the precious gift

358
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,303
of not being you.

359
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,677
Okay, Dad.

360
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,933
Mags, it was fun while it lasted.

361
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,772
Huh? Ha!
I didn't know it was that easy.

362
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,864
-(chuckles)
-Stop that!

363
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,567
(shrieks) Sideshow Bob!

364
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,864
So, Lisa, think we'll see any stars?

365
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,907
Mom, it's a tourist trap.

366
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,161
Celebrities don't actually come in here.

367
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,413
Until today, right?

368
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,825
Well, you never know.

369
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,003
I'll ask the hostess
if anyone's expected.

370
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,292
-Aw, she keeps doing this.
-I'm sorry, what?

371
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,587
Every time she tries
to fix things between us,

372
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,801
it just emphasizes how different we are.

373
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,592
For what it's worth,
my mom loved your show tonight.

374
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,676
She pretty much sees
the best in everything.

375
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,222
Amazing, really,
considering she has a husband

376
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,806
who randomly shows up to work,

377
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,731
a son who, God bless him,
is probably heading for the chair.

378
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,400
And an ungrateful little girl

379
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,859
who ignores her mother's frantic
attempts at reconciliation,

380
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,319
and tells family secrets
to a total stranger.

381
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,990
A total stranger <i>The New York Times</i>
calls "a charming presence."

382
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,951
You don't know me at all!

383
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,951
But hardly anybody likes jazz.

384
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,084
Why should I expect my mom to?

385
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,751
<i>That's right,</i>
<i>you have to see the other side.</i>

386
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,290
<i>The one that always makes you wrong.</i>

387
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,634
(sobs) Mom.

388
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,919
{\an8}Mom, I can't stay mad at you.

389
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,883
{\an8}I'm putting my pearls back on.

390
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,883
{\an8}Oh, thank you, sweetie.

391
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:15,715
{\an8}And I apologize for expressing
my sincere feelings.

392
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,677
(saxophone playing)

393
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,642
(sighs)

394
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,397
Why don't you show us what you got, Lisa?

395
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,559
(chuckles)
That's right, I learned your name.

396
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:31,028
It's not all about me, Andrew Rannells.

397
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,950
20 bucks for ten minutes with the sax.

398
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,993
(playing intro to
"Don't Rain on My Parade")

399
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,331
Hey, that little turd can play.

400
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,002
I'm just getting warmed up.

424
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,019
Straight ahead
is the 19th Street Liquor Store,

425
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,813
the epicenter of the 1967 riots,

426
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,728
which never fully stopped.

(camera shutters click)

428
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,356
Ahead is the high rise
where State Senator Wilcox

429
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,526
was shot in mid-air,
as he plummeted to his death.
