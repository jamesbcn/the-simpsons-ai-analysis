There’s a mannequin there

Milhouse, that is the most

Oh, my God.

{\an8}Oh, shoe-boy?

20
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,818
{\an8}I’m looking for something

{\an8}We’re already on thin ice

{\an8}The shoe size calibrator

27
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,286
{\an8}is for measuring feet

28
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,503
{\an8}Yes, Mr. Freedman.
I’m sorry, Mr. Freedman.

29
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,213
{\an8}That tie really brings out
your eyes, Mr. Freedman.

00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,547
You’re lacing it wrong.

31
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,630
{\an8}I want it overy-undery,

{\an8}I’m leaving this job to work
at Jolly Tamale

36
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,650
{\an8}because the hours are better

{\an8}When you leave,
what happens to your rule

38
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,360

{\an8}Are you guys hitting on us?

49
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,175
{\an8}No, man, we just want
to talk to you

50
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,684
{\an8}about something near
and dear to us.

51
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,845
{\an8}What? Being gay?

52
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,643
{\an8}Close. The Army.

53
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,727
{\an8}Because of exciting
current events,

54
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,022
{\an8}the Army needs new members.

55
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,855
{\an8}New members who want
to earn money for college,

56
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,650
{\an8}and see a part of the world
that tourists never go to.

57
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,855
{\an8}Doesn’t the Army have to fight
in wars?

59
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,237

that you could play for free,

73
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,232
plus it’s real life
and not a game at all?

00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,686

re-enlisting?

What? Homer!

109
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,758
Our son joined the Army.

110
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,128
Eh, big deal,
by the time Bart’s 18,

111
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,796
we’re going to control
the world.

112
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,135
We’re China, right?

113
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,349
Now listen, Bub.

114
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,770
You go down to those recruiters

115
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,678
and tell them Bart is too young
for the Army.

116
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:55,018
I don’t want this to be
the only memory I have of him.

117
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,734
How come I can’t join the army,
but Lisa gets to be in PETA?

118

00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,498
No, you can’t.

126
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,289
Uh, this one’s ruined.

127
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,503
Give me the backup.

128
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,753
Now the babies.

129
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,343

we’ll tear up
your son’s contract.

133
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,444
Sorry, guys.

134
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,653
You know, his mother’s the one
who made me come down here.

135
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,855
Sounds, uh, like
you’re kind of tired

136
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:45,906
of being bossed
around at home.

137
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,408
Go on.

138
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,870
Would you be
interested in, um...

139
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,700
well, I don’t know,
joining the Army?

140
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,866
Wouldn’t that take me away from
my family for two whole years?

141
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,326
Hey, a big target like you will
be home a lot sooner than that.

142
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,338
Whoo-hoo! Where do I sign?

143
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,711
Now where’s my parade?

144
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,468
Where’s my parade?

145
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,471
We have this issue
of <i>Parade Magazine.</i>

00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,364
Homer, with all the things
you’ve done--

149
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,155
go into space, attend
clown college, join the Navy--

150
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,370
I never thought
you’d join the Army.

151
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,621

152
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,832

has Humvees now.

153
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,748
Homie, don’t do this.

154
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,666
You have a wife and three
young children at home.

155
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,465
I have to, Marge.

156
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,429
Who else is gonna keep oil under
a hundred dollars a barrel?

157
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,350
You? Don’t make me laugh.

158
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,259
(laughing)

159
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,602
You couldn’t...

160
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,443
Aw, oh, oh, don’t, no.

161
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,018
(baby talking):
Daddy’s just teasing.

162
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,653
Of course you could.

163
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,610
You could keep it
under a hundred.

164
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,190
Yes, you could.

165
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,185
(whispering):
No, she couldn’t.

166
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,000
Attention!

167
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,658
(shouting):
Ordinarily, I would
spend the next two hours

168
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,208
questioning your sexuality,

169
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,461
running down your hometowns,

170
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,053
and telling you to drop and
give me various numbers.

171
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,339
Are you gonna ask us
our major malfunctions?

172
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,513
’Cause mine is
I care too much.

173
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:33,802
Unfortunately, the demand for
troops has never been higher,

174
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,888
so we’ve got to speed things up.

175
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,273
While you’ve been standing here,
your hair’s been cut,

176
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,691
and your clothes

(sighs)

355
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,995
Mom, we’ve got to stop them
from pacifying our town.

356
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,254
Don’t worry.

357
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,295
I have
a secret weapon--

358
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,588
one more deadly
than any gun.

359
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,092
-Lisa’s face?
-A phone tree.

360
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,335
Huh?

361
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,676
Well, you’d
better hurry.

362
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,181
I don’t think Dad
can last much longer

363
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,182
where he’s hiding.

364
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,813
(coughing)

365
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,310
Dorothy’s daughter comes
every Sunday

366
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,852
and brings all kinds
of wonderful soups.

367
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:43,846
(annoyed):
Oh...

368
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,317
And Melvin’s son
brings a banjo.

369
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,228
And he works our names
into his songs.

370
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,488
(anguished):
Oh...!

371
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,203
Hello, Helen?

372
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:57,161
I’m calling about the recent
destruction of our town.

373
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,952
Well, I have a little plan
to fix their wagon.

374
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,168
(telephones ringing)

375
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,118
-Hello.
-Hello.

376
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:04,958
Hello.

377
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:09,252
-Hello.
-Hello.

378
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,128
Yes, Nelson,
of course I’ll help.

379
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,755
And a haw-haw to you.

380
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,221
So that’s the plan.

381
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,681
We’re meeting
at the reservoir at 8:00 p.m.

382
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,563
I flushed a potato
down the toilet.

383
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,810
Now we have to
live in a hotel.

384
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:22,812
Terrific.

385
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:23,853
Now call
Lindsay Naegle.

386
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,238
Marge, why did you
have us bring our liquor

387
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,109
to the reservoir?

388
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,196
We’re going to dump it in
the water to get the Army drunk.

389
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,162
Wow, uh...

390
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,252
this’ll be the first time
I ever watered down <i>my </i>booze.

391
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,368
(laughs nervously)

392
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,464
Moe, why are your
eyes darting back
and forth so much?

393
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,750
Oh, I-I’m just thinking

394
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,293
about a-a great tennis
match I saw once, yeah.

395
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,797
Uh, uh, now I’m thinking
about ping-pong.

396
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,549
A... ver-very fast chess game.

397
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,972
A... snappy David Mamet play.

398
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,023
What the hell...
happened to us?

399
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,561
I’ll tell you
what happened to us.

400
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,524
Y-You used to be cool and
then you got promoted.

401
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,605
I’m still cool.

402
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,611
Oh, really?

403
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,322
When’s the last time
we took the tank

404
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,112
and went down to
Hansen’s Point?

405
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,445
Just the two of us?

406
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,240
All right, all right,
here’s the plan.

407
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,584
We’re gonna take
a li-little nap,

408
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,960
and then we’re gonna wake up
fresh as daisies.

409
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,958
(snores)

410
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:34,011
Colonel, we’re here to discuss
the terms of your surrender.

411
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,089
Surrender?

412
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,724
Never.

413
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,140
Hmm, let’s see what
your hangover has to say.

414
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,140
(blows horn)

415
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,971
Great Cheney’s Ghost!

416
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,516
You win.

417
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,890
Colonel, I hope
you’ve learned

418
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,516
that an occupying
foreign force

419
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,273
can never defeat
a determined local populace.

420
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,815
Among the many things
we learned in Vietnam...

421
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,690
Horn, please.

422
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,735
(blows horn)

423
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,571
Simpson, you may have won,
but you still have to serve

424
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,987
the remainder of
your tour of duty.

425
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,196
All right,
but no combat.

426
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,707
Don’t you
worry, ma’am.

427
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,998
A man of your
husband’s ingenuity

428
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,252
can be put to
very good use.

429
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,508
Dudes.

430
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,879
Want to make
some extra spending money?

431
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,335
Get a free pair of boots?

432
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,345
Hey, baby,
you like obstacle courses?

433
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,348
Thinking it over, huh?

434
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,309
I’m cool with that.

435
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,679
Hey, pal, like the way
you handle that mop.

436
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:27,677
You like killing?

437
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,478
Hey, ladies.

438
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,021
Are you tired of waiting
for sanctions to work?

439
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,225
I know I am.
