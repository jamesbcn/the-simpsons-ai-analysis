(Homer humming
"The Wabash Cannonball")

181
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,573
Hello.

182
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,447
Where were you all night?

183
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,544
I was just up at this bar
in Spittle County.

184
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,710
You should have called.
I was very worried.

185
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,458
Marge, let's end this
feudin' and a-fussin'

186
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,170

199

Hey, Moe,
you got any Fudd?

200
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,418
Fudd? I thought they
took that off the market

201
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,460
after all those hillbillies
went blind.

202
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,004
Oh no-- I went to this bar
the other night and...

203
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,008
W-wait a minute.

204
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,719
You went to another bar?

205
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,509
Moe, I was 100 miles
out of town.

206
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,433
Oh, Homer.

207
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:19,096

208
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:26,573
Well, if it isn't
Homer J. Simpson.

209
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,029
Lurleen, I can't get your song
out of my mind.

210
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,240
I haven't felt this way
since "Funky Town."

211
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,160
Oh, aren't you sweet.

212
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,869
Do you think I can get
a copy of it?

213
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,369
Sorry darlin'.
All my songs are up here--

214
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,791
"I'm Basting a Turkey
with My Tears,"

215
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,910
"Don't Look Up My Dress
Unless You Mean It,"

216
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,578
"I'm Sick of Your Lying Lips
and False Teeth."

217
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,587
Lurleen, we've got
to crack open your head

218
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,419
and scoop out those songs.

219
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,634

00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,844

my brother owns a radio

226
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,398
and with your permission,
I'd like to take your CD to him.

227
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,395
Homer,
it's your quarter.

228
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,356
What do you say?

229
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,833
I guess so.

-Nothing.

237
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,757

She's wonderful.

249
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:14,303
I could feel her sweet country soul
in every digitally encoded bit.

250
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,222
Country music sucks.

251
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,050
All it does is take precious air
space away from shock deejays

252
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,886
whose cruelty and profanity
amuse us all.

253
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,682
Shut up, boy.
Marge, what do you think?

254
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,347
Well, it's nice,
but who is this woman?

255
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,806
Well, right now she's an
out-of-work cocktail waitress,

256
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,527
but she's going to be
a country music superstar,

257
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,238
like, uh, that jerk
in the cowboy hat,

258
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,199
and that dead lady.

259
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,819
I don't like you hanging around
some cocktail waitress.

260
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,367
Marge, you make it
sound so seamy.

261
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,911
All I did was spend
the afternoon in her trailer

262
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,035
watching her try on
some outfits.

263
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,463
(growling)

264
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,461
(ringing)

265
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,792
Well, hi, Lurleen.

266
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,546
We were just talking about you.

267
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,668
Uh, I think I can come over.
Let me ask my wife.

268
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,376
(angry groaning)

269
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,927
It's a date.

270
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,724
Oh, Homer.

271
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,557
Everybody's been calling--

272
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:10,732
Mama, Daddy, the triplets,
Vonda Mae, Piney Joe...

273
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,653
and I owe it all to you.

274
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,233
Don't thank me, Lurleen.

275
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,147
You should be thanking
your brain.

276
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,816
Oh, wow, Homer.

277
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,324
No man has ever been
this nice to me without...

278
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,577
you know, wanting
something in return.

279
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,370
Well, I was going to ask
for a glass of water,

280
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,254
but now I feel kinda
guilty about it.

281
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,170
(chuckling)
Homer, you're just a big sack of sugar.

282
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,541
Thanks.

283
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,547
You did say "sugar," right?

284
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,878
Uh-huh.

285
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:39,433
Now, Homer,
I want you to be my manager.

286
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,548
Really?
Well, I should warn you,

287
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,175
-I'm not great with figures.
-That's okay.

288
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,562
I make a lot of
stupid decisions.

289
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,638
Nobody's perfect.

290
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,603
-I did bad in school.
-I didn't even go.

291
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,273
My personal hygiene has
been described as--

292
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,151
Homer, Homer,
you'll be a great manager.

293
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,019
There's only
one thing you need.

294
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,226
Now, this is made from
a space-age fabric

295
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,448
developed especially
for Elvis.

296
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:02,568
Sweat actually cleans
this suit.

297
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:03,866
Hmm.

298
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:06,945
(growling)

299
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,746
(footsteps approaching)

300
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:09,789
(door opening)

301
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,422
Marge, look at me.

302
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,749
I don't want to--
I'm mad at you.

303
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,344
I'm sick of that waitress and
all the time you've been spending with her

304
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,170
and this whole
country music thing.

305
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,915
Then maybe you'd better
not look at me.

306
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,337
(gasps)

307
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,795
Homer, where did you
get that suit?

308
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,176
A friend bought it for me.

309
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,773
Was it Lurleen?

310
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:31,098
-No. I think it was Lenny.
-Don't lie to me.

311
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,345
-Are you having an affair with this woman?
-No!

312
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,767
-Have you kissed her?
-No!

313
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,395
-Has she kissed you?
-A couple of times.

314
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,442
I want you
to stop seeing her.

315
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,186
I can't-- I'm her manager.

316
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,147
Her manage--
That's ridiculous.

317
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,318
I won't allow you
to spend any more time

318
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,235
away from your family.

319
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,544
Marge, you're standing
in the way of my boyhood dream

320
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,698
of managing a beautiful
country singer!

321
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,747
Your boyhood dream was to eat
the world's biggest hoagie,

322
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,292
and you did it at the county
fair last year, remember?

323
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,456
Marge, Lurleen's gonna
be a big success,

324
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,705
and whether you like it or not,
I'm going to be there.

325
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,837
Fine. See if I care!

326
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,434
(footsteps, door slams)

327
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,349
(sniffling)

328
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,641
MAN: This studio has
a lot of history.

329
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,056
Buddy Holly stood on
this spot in 1958 and said,

330
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,315
"There is no way in hell that
I'm gonna record in this dump."

331
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,439
I'm sure Lurleen
will love it.

332
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,026
(gasps) Homer, how much
did you just give that man?

333
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,492
Calm down, Marge.
It's just our life savings.

334
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,623
I'm not going to go
into hock for this.

335
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,240
Hey, Colonel Homer.

336
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,907
And you must be...

337
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,746
Mrs. Homer Simpson.

338
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,751
Charmed.

339
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,252
Hmm.

340
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,753
I thought you said
she was overweight.

341
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,165
Marge, it takes
two to lie:

342
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,843
one to lie
and one to listen.

343
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,381
What does that mean?

344
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,884
I don't have time to answer
all these questions.

345
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,176
Time is money.

346
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,049
Come on, people.

347
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,636
Well, come on, boys.

00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,221
