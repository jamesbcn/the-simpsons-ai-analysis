1
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,411
Homer, the results of your
physical are very concerning.

2
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:15,015
- You're 80 pounds overweight.
- I wore my socks on the scale.

3
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:17,084
And your cholesterol
is sky‐high.

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,452
Go big or go home.

5
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,822
Oh, and your testosterone
is just a little bit low.

6
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,524
Testosterone?

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,425
That's what fuels
my punching and yelling.

8
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,094
And my undeserved confidence.

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,333
Now I'll never be an
NFL quarterback/international superspy.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,070
Don't worry, low T is very
common amongst men your age.

11
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,006
It can be treated
with a prescription drug

12
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,674
called Vicodude.

13
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:43,911
- Pill me up.
- But before I give you the drug,

14
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:48,181
I just need you to watch
this short informational video.

15
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,250
There's an ad first?

16
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:53,420
If I had more testosterone,
I'd kill you.

17
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:57,457
A single truck can't possibly be
best in its class

18
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:00,594
in torque, towing and payload.

19
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:04,798
Think again, Professor Killjoy.

20
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,470
Man up with the Road Monster

21
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,739
Triple‐XL 550.

22
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:17,811
The Triple‐XL 550
delivers ultimate tow,

23
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,213
ultimate payload

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,183
and ultimate torque.

25
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,086
The Triple‐XL 550.

26
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:28,855
It's what a man drives.

27
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:32,960
Dr. Hibbert, you're a genius.

28
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:35,162
That truck
is exactly what I need.

29
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,764
No, what you need is medication.

30
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,634
Wrong again, Professor Killjoy.

31
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,436
See you next year.

32
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,104
Not if this chart is right.

33
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,876
Peonies are such
interesting flowers.

34
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,178
They need less water, but...

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,116
Look what the doctor
made me get.

36
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,886
You know it, baby.

37
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,088
The engine growls
just like that.

38
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,991
And don't worry, it has
maximum torque for its class

39
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:08,561
and the highest possible
ranking from J.D. Power.

40
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,263
What about his associates?

41
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,966
Oh, you know they're on board.

42
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,167
Look at me.

43
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,770
I'm a payload.

44
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,706
This truck is an offense to
everything I hold dear, and...

45
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:24,244
Oh, but it comes with a family
subscription to Slapify,

46
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,146
the music streaming service.

47
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:29,616
I don't know what that is,
but I'm great for having it.

48
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:32,986
Whoa, and check out
the picture on the back‐up cam.

49
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:35,922
It even has infrared.

50
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:42,295
Okay, Slapify,
let's see if your algorithm

51
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,431
can predict my taste.

52
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,467
Good luck.

53
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,270
Age, eight. Gender, female.

54
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,340
How did you hear about truck.

55
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,909
Oh, it already has suggestions.

56
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:01,147
A little trendy,
not for me.

57
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:07,020
Okay, but still
pretty mainstream.

58
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:08,955
Good taste is a curse,

59
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,759
but I'm sure a great song
is just a click away.

60
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,667
If you hate everything,
you might like this.

61
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,836
Quilloughby?
Never heard of him.

62
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:26,272
Quilloughby and his British
bandmates, the Snuffs,

63
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,241
dominated the '80s indie scene

64
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,977
with their brand
of literate, sardonic...

65
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,479
Ooh, sardonic.

66
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,582
Music that focused
on Quilloughby's obsessions,

67
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:39,652
especially his
militant vegetarianism.

68
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,724
<i>The flesh that you cover
with cheese</i>

69
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,128
<i>Is proof
of your moral disease</i>

70
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,598
<i>It's death for no reason</i>

71
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,333
<i>And death for no reason</i>

72
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,902
<i>Is hamburger homicide</i>

73
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,609
Yes.

74
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:08,648
Quilloughby's music
is so smart and dour and jangly

75
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:12,886
and no one has seen him in
30 years, he's a famous recluse.

76
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:16,389
And his commitment to
animal rights is so inspiring.

77
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:20,860
I just had
the most amazing idea.

78
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,631
Lisa doesn't like it
when other people talk.

79
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,535
Attention, Elementarians.

80
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,237
Inspired by
my new favorite musician,

81
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,239
whom I'm sure
you've never heard of,

82
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,842
today is the first
Mushroom Monday.

83
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:40,346
So dig in to these
all‐vegan mushroom tacos.

84
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,883
Mushrooms?
Those are chairs for toads.

85
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,387
Don't you see? The flesh
that you cover with cheese

86
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,190
is proof of your moral disease.

87
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:54,427
Just give them a chance.

88
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,595
So delicious.

89
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:59,332
Three kinds of ground mushrooms,
portobello, shiitake...

90
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,103
Don't forget the yummy
little pieces of bacon.

91
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,575
You said these were vegan.

92
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,145
But they are.
Vegetables plus bacon.

93
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,581
Vegon. Am I wrong?

94
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,650
I ate meat.

95
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,920
This taco had a mom.

96
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,136
Everyone at my school is a jerk.

97
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,304
Why are they so mean? Why?

98
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,506
Is the problem me?

99
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,975
The problem is never you.

100
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,677
It's those sour‐breathed
know‐nothing sheep

101
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:48,548
who graze the blighted meadows
of your so‐called school.

102
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,686
Okay, it was probably
just a bacon hallucination.

103
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,256
Quilloughby isn't actually
in my room.

104
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,725
I'm traumatized by eating meat.

105
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,260
You must stop
talking to yourself.

106
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:01,761
People will think
you've gone mad.

107
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,513
You're not real the real
Quilloughby. You're imaginary.

108
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,872
I've gone crazy.

109
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:14,140
<i>Master of the obvious</i>

110
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,677
<i>Ensconced in her dreadful
red frock</i>

111
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,446
I don't want to be crazy.
Not this kind of crazy.

112
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,848
Just get out of here.

113
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,284
Hey, Lis, what you pointing at?

114
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,452
Some bacon you want to eat?

115
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,788
I've got a pig nose.
Want to eat me?

116
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,904
Bart, slowly,
almost imperceptibly,

117
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,607
your friends
are growing tired of you.

118
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:51,577
What? What? I'm the drumstick
of this chicken bucket.

119
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,013
They're not getting tired of me.

120
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,183
Of course we're not, Bart.

121
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,818
Wait, what was that look?

122
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,586
What look?

123
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,357
You guys are not
getting tired of me.

124
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,027
No, no, I was just yawning

125
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,364
because I stayed up late,
thinking about your pranks.

126
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,066
Still so fresh.

127
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,440
Quilloughby, you completely
ruined my brother

128
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,442
with just one sentence.

129
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:23,776
Thank you.

130
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:27,580
Oh, there's nothing
more tiresome than gratitude.

131
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,016
I think I'm gonna like
hallucinating you.

132
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,319
Here's a gift. Put this
on your faded Army jacket.

133
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,721
Oh, my God.

134
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,924
You think I'm cool enough
to wear a faded Army jacket.

135
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,195
Keep in mind, I'm merely a product
of your fractured psyche.

136
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:44,196
Oh, shut up, don't ruin it.

137
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,771
Hey, Homer, ever so slowly,

138
00:07:51,837 --> 00:07:54,340
your friends
are growing tired of you.

139
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,275
With this much testosterone?

140
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,777
No way, baby.

141
00:07:57,843 --> 00:08:00,379
Take me
for a ride in your truck.

142
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,847
Trucks aren't for driving.

143
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,116
They're for doing
kick‐ass truck stuff.

144
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,886
Have you actually done
any truck stuff?

145
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,387
Put it on.

146
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,496
But I don't want this.

147
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,898
You're welcome!

148
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,152
For an imaginary friend,
you were really keen

149
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,087
to get out of the house.

150
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,723
That small woman
was such a bore.

151
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,592
Maggie's a baby,
and she was sleeping.

152
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,094
Even she knows it.

153
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,696
This place reminds me
of my own hometown.

154
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,265
It's dismal and nothing good
will ever come from it.

155
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,001
Well, almost nothing.

156
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,269
Get out your tickers and tape,

157
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,338
here comes the prat parade.

158
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,942
Facial hair is not
a substitute for personality.

159
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,611
Two times zero is still zero.

160
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,814
Bit early
for the apricot brandy,

161
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,017
is it not, Vicar?

162
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,953
Quilloughby,
is there anyone you do like?

163
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,555
Yeah, well, let me
tell you something, Lisa.

164
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,426
<i>Every day I try to smile</i>

165
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,863
<i>But can't help but frown</i>

166
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,700
<i>Every day I draw my bath</i>

167
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,836
<i>And pray I will drown</i>

168
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:35,574
<i>I step out my door
and I take a deep breath</i>

169
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:39,512
<i>Turn back inside
and pray for my death</i>

170
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:41,380
<i>'Cause everyone is horrid</i>

171
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:44,183
<i>Except me and possibly you</i>

172
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,985
<i>Possibly me</i>

173
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,953
<i>Oh, everyone is horrid</i>

174
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,958
<i>And my dear,
I fear you are too</i>

175
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,906
Lisa Simpson.

176
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:10,276
Those measures were supposed
to be pianissimo,

177
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:14,880
but instead they were sforzando
and scherzando.

178
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,190
Well, would you care to share your
private tee‐hees with the class?

179
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:27,026
I was just thinking,
every day you wave that wand,

180
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,563
and yet nothing magical
ever happens.

181
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,034
You're a smart‐mouthed
little sass pants.

182
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:39,505
And you're a sad little man
whose best days never happened.

183
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,275
I'm not sad, I'm happy.

184
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,945
And 5'8" is a very nice height
for a fella.

185
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:48,414
Very nice.

186
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,817
Lisa, I enjoyed that.

187
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,986
And I enjoy nothing.

188
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,466
Mr. and Mrs. Simpson,
I called you in here

189
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,123
because Lisa's behavior has
become wry, sardonic, and yes,

190
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,262
poetically world‐weary.

191
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,597
I know what's going on.

192
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,732
Lisa's become infatuated

193
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,936
with this snobby, judgy,
British crooner from the '80s.

194
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,407
You're right to worry.

195
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,676
With the popularity of
the Slapify streaming service,

196
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,712
I'm seeing more children
becoming lost

197
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,347
in the music of the past.

198
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:23,883
<i>Oh, here she comes</i>

199
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,552
<i>Watch out, boy,
she'll chew you up</i>

200
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,788
<i>Oh, here she comes</i>

201
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,690
<i>She's a man‐eater!</i>

202
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,993
Well, we take this
very seriously.

203
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:35,895
My husband and I are
going to have

204
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,197
a heart‐to‐heart
with our daughter tonight.

205
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,398
Isn't that right, Homer?

206
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:46,105
You don't tow me!
I tow you!

207
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,673
Stop resisting!

208
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,975
Surrender to my mighty torque!

209
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,878
Never!

210
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,790
What has gotten into you?

211
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,193
You used to be
such a happy little girl.

212
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,727
When?

213
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,930
Okay, but never like this...

214
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,464
with the sour attitude,

215
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:13,933
and the black booties.

216
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,669
You've become a crab...
no, a pill!

217
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:20,272
Lisa, darling,
please silence the din.

218
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,809
That's it!

219
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,478
I'm cancelling
your music subscription.

220
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,615
Jiggly... and bloop.

221
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,351
Shocking.

222
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,889
How can Mom take away
the only place

223
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,757
I can hear your music?

224
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,026
Maybe not the only place.

225
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,362
Apparently, this is happening.

226
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,799
Oh, my God.

227
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,902
I can see you.
I mean, the real you.

228
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,737
Well, you're in for
a treat, my dear.

229
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,072
My live shows are, quote,

230
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:56,675
like a three‐hour dance party
in a freshly‐dug grave.

231
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,478
David Fricke,
Rolling Stone magazine, 1987.

232
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,214
Oh, but Marge will never
let me go.

233
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,883
And even if she would,
I don't have enough money.

234
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,819
Those tickets cost,
like, five Lego sets.

235
00:13:07,886 --> 00:13:09,488
Look in your pocket, Lisa.

236
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,225
My dad's credit card.

237
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,028
Did you steal this?
Did I?

238
00:13:16,094 --> 00:13:17,996
A little of both.
It's complicated.

239
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,965
Sometimes I identify
as imaginary,

240
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,700
but sometimes I can do this.

241
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:26,638
Ow, the zipper!

242
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,348
What?
I'm a little stressed out.

243
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,750
Making sandwiches
calms my nerves.

244
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:42,588
Ooh, sandwiches!

245
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,125
Lisa is sullen, dressing weird,

246
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:49,828
obsessed with English music...

247
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,931
Our eight‐year‐old has
turned into a teenager.

248
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,735
Well, from now on, I'm going to
pay very close attention to her.

249
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:01,106
Marge, little girls are a lot
like all‐wheel anti‐lock brakes

250
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,375
when road conditions
are unpredictable...

251
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:06,411
We're talking about
your daughter, not a vehicle.

252
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:10,415
Well, both do have maximum
torque for their class.

253
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,985
Will you shut up
about the damn truck?

254
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:14,953
But the truck is who I am.

255
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,290
It's a perfect fit for my manly,
off‐road lifestyle.

256
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,658
Oh, really?

257
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,126
You hate the outdoors.

258
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,527
You've never been camping.

259
00:14:22,594 --> 00:14:24,396
You've never hauled
or towed anything,

260
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:27,132
or shown any interest
in hauling or towing.

261
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,235
And please, tell me the meaning
of the word torque.

262
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:34,239
The smoke hole where
the truck's farts come out?

263
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,008
Torque is
the tendency of a force

264
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:39,211
to rotate the body to which
it is applied. Like this!

265
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,179
Homer J. Simpson,

266
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:43,649
you are not a truck guy!

267
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,322
Now, I'm going to deal with
an actual problem,

268
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,592
our daughter's
pre‐pre‐teen rebellion.

269
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,462
Lisa's gone!

270
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:02,501
I'm going to my first music
festival with my best friend!

271
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:05,237
Best imaginary friend.

272
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,606
Right. I guess
I didn't need to buy

273
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,608
two VIP passes then.

274
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:10,876
Sorry, Dad!

275
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:15,514
Oh, the pain of laughter...

276
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,789
Our daughter is by herself

277
00:15:23,855 --> 00:15:25,424
at an outdoor
music whoop‐de‐doo!

278
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,427
And she's using
my stolen credit card.

279
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:29,528
What?

280
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:31,763
Hey...

281
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,031
No...

282
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:37,302
This combines my two
least favorite things...

283
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,738
other people's music,
and other people.

284
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,674
Yeah, but we're going to see
the real you perform.

285
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,176
Ooh, do you think you'll play

286
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:46,244
Labour Action
at the Biscuit Factory

287
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:48,080
or Simon Has a Birthmark?

288
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:49,948
How dreadfully predictable...

289
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,983
but the nippers must suckle.

290
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,287
Oh, these bands are all rubbish,

291
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,556
and this sun is too sunny.

292
00:15:57,622 --> 00:16:00,225
Quilloughby, this festival
is our dream.

293
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,295
Stop being such a, such a...

294
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,730
Such a pill?

295
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:06,365
Sorry, Marge.

296
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:09,000
Hey, I'm just trying
to have a fun day.

297
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:11,002
Oh, a fun day.

298
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:13,572
Why don't we all just
have fizzy drinks

299
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:15,607
and rainbow lollipops?

300
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:19,411
Happy, happy, happy.

301
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:23,081
Vacuous animals waiting
for the slaughter.

302
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:28,329
Well, it's a good thing
Dad got this truck.

303
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:29,821
- Oh, my God.
- You see, Marge?

304
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,299
- I never want to hear another word...
- Bart gets it.

305
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,400
- About this truck.
- The truck is awesome.

306
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:33,984
- It makes me so mad!
- You don't get it...

307
00:16:34,025 --> 00:16:35,269
- And you never will!
- Truck this, truck that.

308
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:37,773
- Truck, truck, truck, truck...
- I wish I was married to Bart!

309
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,600
You never stop whining!

310
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,268
The term is whinging.

311
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,904
Conspicuous eye roll.

312
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,073
I used to think
you just hated bad art

313
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,408
and cruelty to animals

314
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:51,476
and people who wear
baseball hats,

315
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:54,780
but it turns out
you hate everything!

316
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:58,150
But, Lisa,
I thought that was our bond.

317
00:16:58,216 --> 00:16:59,918
Coming now to the main stage...

318
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,486
performing for the first time

319
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:02,921
in over 30 years...

320
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,056
Quilloughby and the Snuffs.

321
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:06,725
This is it...

322
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:07,826
The real you!

323
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,131
Oh, dear God, no!

324
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,367
I look like bloody Churchill!

325
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:21,807
Shut your gobs, you wankers!

326
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:26,077
Woo‐hoo! Wankers!

327
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:29,114
Can't you see this show
is just a cash grab?

328
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,882
I'm only here
because I lost my fortune

329
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,084
suing people for saying things
about me

330
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:35,353
that were completely true.

331
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,524
Is this what I turned into?

332
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,092
I'm greedy, I'm hateful,

333
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:43,995
and my face looks like
a syphilitic moon.

334
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:46,031
Well, it's not your fault
you got old.

335
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:47,466
Sting is old.

336
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:50,635
Old Sting's bloody gorgeous,
and he knows it.

337
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:58,977
You can jeer while
I enjoy this pastrami on rye.

338
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,247
But you're vegan!

339
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,482
I was,

340
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:06,384
until I found out veganism
was invented by foreigners,

341
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:09,387
of whom there are far too many
on this planet!

342
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:13,358
That's right,
I hate the foreign!

343
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,161
Coming to this country
and taking our jobs!

344
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,630
Sleeping with our men!

345
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,131
But you're a foreigner!

346
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:23,435
And you took the job
of sad, washed‐up rock star.

347
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,972
No! You turned your back
on veganism.

348
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:30,108
And you're also a huge racist.

349
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:34,613
Because everything is horrid
except meat,

350
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,516
so slag off to you!

351
00:18:40,318 --> 00:18:43,054
Lisa, dear, don't let him
happen to you.

352
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:45,190
Try not to sneer at everything.

353
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,659
And listen to others,
at least a bit.

354
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,394
Perhaps one out of five times,

355
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,663
but I can't tell you
which times.

356
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,198
Thanks, Quilloughby.

357
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,933
You're the best imaginary friend

358
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,736
a complicated eight‐year‐old
could ever ask for.

359
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,306
But I think we both know
it's time for you to go.

360
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:04,976
I'm going to miss you,

361
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,178
you bloody wanker.

362
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,085
Okay, okay, okay,

363
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:16,721
I'm going to play a few songs
off my new album.

364
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:20,625
It's entitled
Refugees? Again?

365
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,505
Stupid millennial traffic.

366
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,009
And this is just in,
a full‐scale riot has broken out

367
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,477
at the Bummershoot Festival.

368
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:41,880
But Lisa's in there!

369
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:43,448
Who will save her?

370
00:19:43,514 --> 00:19:47,252
Did someone call
for a truck guy?

371
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,068
Misplaced anger!

372
00:20:04,135 --> 00:20:06,371
Somebody save me!

373
00:20:16,614 --> 00:20:18,549
Torque, don't fail me now.

374
00:20:18,616 --> 00:20:20,885
Truck, truck, hooray!

375
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:23,154
Truck, truck, hooray...

376
00:20:24,622 --> 00:20:27,358
Homer. Homer. Homer, wake up.

377
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:29,294
He fell asleep while driving?

378
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,797
No, we got stuck in traffic
and ran out of gas,

379
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,332
so Dad ate a garbage bag

380
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,401
full of Mom's PB&Js
and passed out.

381
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:38,636
Thanks for walking over
and getting me.

382
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:41,406
Me and Trucky saved the day.

383
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:43,574
Sure you did, Homer.

384
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:47,412
Testosterone...

385
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,182
I don't know what came
over me, Mom.

386
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:52,750
I was sullen, moody,

387
00:20:52,817 --> 00:20:55,286
thought everybody except me
was an idiot...

388
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:58,423
Wait, is that what
being a teenager is like?

389
00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:00,325
Well, sometimes, sweetie.

390
00:21:00,391 --> 00:21:02,527
Were you ever like that?

391
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:06,931
Blue mascara is who I am, Mom!

392
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:11,069
You're just jealous because
you can't pull off hot pants.

393
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:12,870
For your information,
I was going

394
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:14,205
to break up with Homer.

395
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:16,607
But if you hate him,
he must be great.

396
00:21:16,674 --> 00:21:19,944
Honey, whatever phases
you go through,

397
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:22,046
I'll always be waiting for you

398
00:21:22,113 --> 00:21:24,615
on the other side
of the slammed door.
