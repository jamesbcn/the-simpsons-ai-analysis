{\an8}George, I'm sorry
to see you up here.

11
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,122
{\an8}Well, yes, but I died
for a worthy cause.

12
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,166
{\an8}As we speak, my body
is about to be dissected

13
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,801
{\an8}by a budding
young scientist.

14
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,919
{\an8}Let's observe
the dedication to learning

15
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,716
{\an8}of this ten-year-old scholar
by the name of Bart Simpson.

00:00:56,806 --> 00:01:00,886
{\an8}Well, his passion
is undeniable.

19
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,057
{\an8}Yes, very...
very impressive.

20
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,606
{\an8}By examining my specimen's
pyloric sphincter valve,

21
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:10,611
{\an8}I deduced that she had
an affinity for fruit flies.

22
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,615
{\an8}By examining my specimen's
natty dreads,

23
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:18,538
{\an8}I was able to deduce that he was
a jammin' Rasta-frogian.

24
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,960
{\an8}My body,
my little green body.

25
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,629
{\an8}Okay, but surely
his portrayal

26
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:27,708
{\an8}of Rastafarianism
will be culturally sensitive.

00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,256

{\an8}Come now, George.

32
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,429
{\an8}At least this Scottish
groundskeeper

33
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,687
{\an8}will give your remains
a respectful burial.

00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,280
{\an8}Hmm? Are you?!

38
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,452
{\an8}Well, are you?

00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,830
{\an8}Well, uh... ribbit?

{\an8}MARGE: I can't put these grades
on the refrigerator.

41
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,209
{\an8}I can't even put them
on the garage refrigerator.

42
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,869
{\an8}It's not my fault.

43
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,918
{\an8}-I blame "so-key-ity."
-What?!

44
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,631
You know, so-key-ity.

45
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,091
That's what everyone
blames for everything.

46
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,842
You mean "society"?

47
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,144
-Yeah, that's the guy.
-Honey,

48
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,928
I know you're a bright boy,

49
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,141
but if you don't try harder
in school,

50
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,222
you could end up...

51
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,074
...not a success.

52
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,070
Oh, that.
Don't worry, Mom.

53
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,282
As long as I can stand on a corner

54
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,992
and spin a sign reading "new condos,"

55
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,072
I'll be just fine.

56
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,253
(groaning)

57
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,368

00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,129
(Marge groaning)

59
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,709
All that pacing
isn't gonna fix the boy.

60
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,085
Just get him some pills.

61
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,422
Two pinks and a blue,
and it's off to the races.

62
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,627
Everything we've tried
with Bart has failed.

63
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,638
What if there's nothing
we can do?

64
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,930
Mm, "nothing we can do"
is a whole lot better

65
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,474
than "it'll take all we've got."

66
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:06,477
I wonder if anyone talks
about parenting online.

67
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,727
Look at this one!

68
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,525
HOMER:
They're skiing.

69
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,149
Skiing means happy.

70
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:17,065
Hmm, an expert with
a new book to promote.

71
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,655
Oh, I wonder if she'd be willing
to speak to a group for a fee.

72
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,245
Getting your child established

73
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,750
on the path to success
isn't easy.

74
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,632
I was driving my daughter
from her falconry tournament

75
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,170
to lute class
when she turned to me asked...

76
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,714
(speaks Mandarin)

77
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,587
...which is Mandarin for,
"How do you do it?"

78
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,505
She and I are learning Mandarin.

79
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,724
The answer?
(speaks Mandarin)

80
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,514
Positive reinforcement.

81
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,518
(inquisitive chatter)

82
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,140
In a recent study,
this mouse was denied food

83
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,858
whenever he failed
to find his way through a maze.

84
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,029
The mouse ended up dying...
of low self-esteem.

85
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,358
(shocked and excited chatter)

86
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,704
I had a nightmare
where that happened to Bart,

87
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,700
but I never told you about it.

88
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,202
I love it when you
don't tell me things.

89
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,874
This mouse was given food

90
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,123
whether he got
through the maze or not.

91
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,535
And this fall,
he'll be in a lab at Harvard.

92
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,955
(excited gasps and chatter)

93
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:17,134
Low self-esteem can cripple
your child's chances of success.

94
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,875
The cure: praise.

95
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,297
(excited chatter)

96
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,465
Praise they can hold
in their hands.

97
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:26,143
Certificates, ribbons and, yes,
even trophies.

98
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,144
(crowd gasps)

99
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,725
(gasps) Trophies.

100
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,060
So that's the easy answer.

101
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,895
If Ralphie's shelf
says he's a winner,

102
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,571
then he'll be one!

103
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,779
And Moe yells a third thing
to feel part of the group!

104
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,492
Yes! Trophies--
that's what Bart needs.

105
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,493
This is how we save him.

106
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,785
(scoffs) Give Bart a trophy?
What for?

107
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,079
Most boogers wiped
on a bedroom wall?

108
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,123
They're giving trophies
for that now?

109
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,827
I weep for this country.

110
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,877
Bart's future is at stake.

111
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,131
Besides, I'm tired
of Springfield missing out

112
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:01,553
on every parenting trend.
Like the time-out and the diaper.

113
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,594
I never got a trophy
when I was a kid,

114
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,308
and I turned out just...

115
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,388
(gulping)

116
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:14,314
(slowly)
...fine.

117
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,897
He's my son, and he's getting
a trophy for nothing.

118
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,404
You hear me?
For nothing!

119
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,985
Huh. Huh?

120
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:24,953
(screams)

121
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,203
Good morning.

122
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,544
How's my special
little winner?

123
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,329
How'd you get that thing
in my bed without waking me up?

124
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,794
Because you're
a champion sleeper.

125
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,875
It's the craziest thing.

126
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,210
She will not give up
on that kid.

127
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,836
Trophies <i>can </i>
boost self-esteem.

128
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,263
If you actually win them,
like I did.

129
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,553
But what's the point

130
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,925
of just handing out
unearned statues?

131
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,433
And statuettes.

132
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,934
Well, it's just a waste
of gullible parents' money.

133
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,687
<i>(echoing) Waste of gullible</i>
<i>parents' money.</i>

134
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,940
<i>Gullible parents' money.</i>

135
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,772
<i>Money. Money.</i>

136
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,567
-(bell dings)
-Hmm.

137
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,900
Step right up!
Every kid's a winner!

138
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,406
The more you spend,
the more you love!

139
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,949
Mm-hmm.

140
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,949
I thought you agreed
that trophies should be earned.

141
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,287
I'm earning nature's
trophy: money.

142
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,293
(wind whistles softly)

143
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,464
Remember, folks.

144
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,091
Nothing but a genuine
Trophyland trophy says

145
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,839

for any accomplishment.

160
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,294
Not wetting the bed,
using your inside voice,

161
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,922
even "go watch TV
in the other room."

162
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:00,089
I still think these things
are good for their self-esteem.

163
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,749
Not to mention
the self-esteem

164
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,168
that comes from
wad riffling.

165
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,167

166
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,638
Look, I even put the boy to work.

167
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,428
Well, then he should get
a trophy for that.

168
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,763
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

169
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,268
We have a saying in
the participation trophy business.

170
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,390
"Don't get high--
self-esteem--

171
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,597
on your own supply--
of self-esteem."

172
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,018
I don't care.
I'm giving him this.

173
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,817
What?
Why did it break?

174
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,530
The parts are of
the highest quality.

175
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,450
They come from
the China of China: India.

176
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,537
Boy, did you glue this trophy together
with bubblegum?

177
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,198
Eh, sticky is sticky.
I'm taking my break.

178
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,053
HOMER: See?
Giving him trophies did nothing.

179
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,670
You've showered him
with praise,

180
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,546
and he's just
as lazy as ever.

181
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,723
Shh!
What if he heard you say that?

182
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,262
Hey, if Bart is as bad
at eavesdropping

183
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,016
as he is at everything else,

184
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,098
we've got nothing
to worry about.

185
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,234
I say we keep
talking loudly.

186
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,271
But what about
his confidence?

187
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,694
Face it.
Our son is a screw-up.

188
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,783
He was born a screw-up,
and no matter how hard he tries--

189
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,360
which he never will--

190
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,775
Bart will <i>always </i>
be a screw-up.

191
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,164
(groans)

192
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,950
And have you ever heard that sound
he makes when he's sad?

193
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,495
Pathetic.

194
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:21,881
(sighs)

195
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,764
Queen's bishop Lomotil
takes king's Ativan.

196
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,049
Oh, looks like I'll be
having a panic attack

197
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,433
on the toilet tonight.

198
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,100
(scoffs) Look at that
whimpering little crybaby.

199
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,809
(mocking)
Wah! Wah!

200
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,389
Abe, that's your grandson.

201
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,805
Come visit me!

202
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,483
I'm so lonely!

203
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:44,021
(crying)
Wah! Wah!

204
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,976
What's got you down, kiddo?

205
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,437
My dad says I'm terrible
at everything.

206
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,408
Oh, he's just repeating
what he heard as a boy from me.

207
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,869
Oh, I was an awful father,
just like my old man.

208
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,621
Your dad didn't
believe in you, either?

209
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,082
It wasn't his fault.

210
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,622
He was just focused
on his career

211
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,076
as a professional child-beater.

212
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,037
<i>Men would come</i>
<i>from five towns over</i>

213
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,957
<i>to study my father's technique.</i>

214
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,716
<i>But no matter</i>
<i>how many strangles he patented,</i>

215
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,129
<i>his father never approved.</i>

216
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,428
(choking loudly)

217
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,431
Even if only a little bit
of that really happened,

218
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,644
I'll never escape
being a loser.

219
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,274
That's loser talk!

220
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:23,151
You're a great kid,
and I'm gonna prove it to you.

221
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,316
Boy, this here's a real trophy.

222
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,609
Our family's
most prized possession:

223
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,283
a Baumont Chrono-master Elite.

224
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,782
It's been a Simpson heirloom

225
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,993
ever since it was stolen
off a dead body at Gettysburg.

226
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,735
In 1982.

227
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,497
Whoa!

228
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,079
Wait. Is this just another
gold shiny thing

229
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,254
to trick me into
feeling special when I'm not?

230
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,543
You are special!

231
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,336
You're like my prostate--

232
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,720
a spiky little troublemaker
who plays by his own rules.

233
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,678
You don't take hooey
from Louie.

234
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,678
Never have, never will.

235
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,259
(shudders)

236
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,887
I feel something.

237
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,104
It's like a sunburn
on the inside.

238
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,394
It's called "pride."

239
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,937
Every tick will remind you

240
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,151
you've got a grandpa
who believes in you.

241
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,771
The same way I believe

242
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,938
the retirement home
has been taken over by robots.

243
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,738
(Eastern European accent)
I am not a robot.

244
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,571
I just have
light-up sneakers.

00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,840
Why is my trophy the smallest?

248
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,171
You all lost-- to me!

249
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,927
(confused murmurs)

250
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,679
Lisa, are you suggesting
we engage in excellence bias?

251
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,773
(crying)
She's loser-shaming me.

00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,481
Why do you always have
to make trouble, ya wee harpy?

255
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,225
How am I supposed to stay silent

256
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,987
when parents are just blindly
chasing the latest trend?

257
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,281
Ugh, parents.

258
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,374
Those lazy lunch-packers.

259
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,489
They just want to be told
what to do.

260
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:04,076
And there's no shortage of experts
who want to tell 'em.

261
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,173
<i>WILLIE: (echoing)</i>
<i>No shortage of experts.</i>

00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,342
(bell dings)

264
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,918
<i>LISA: (thinking)</i>
<i>Another parenting expert, eh?</i>

265
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,684
Clearly,
this is a community in the grip

266
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,089
of an addiction to trophies.

267
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,257
Now, parents,

268
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,515
I warn you, too much praise
creates millennials--

269
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,728
a generation of soft,
entitled narcissists,

270
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,270
who drop out of college
to become deejays.

271
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,935
That only pays well
at the very highest levels.

272
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,315
Instead of showering
your kids with gifts,

273
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,533
you should prod them
to greatness with G.R.I.T.

274
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,284
Get up. Retry.

275
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,116
I don't care if you're...

276
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,621
Tired.

277
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,663
He's got a word made
of other words.

278
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,996
(chuckles) He must know
what he's talking about.

279
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,582
Oh, it is an end to praise.

280
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,997
Praise Vishnu.

281
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,045
(crowd exclaims, murmurs)

282
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,129
Remember,
G.R.I.T. also stands for:

283
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,474
Get Rid of Idiotic Trophies.

284
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,141
Another word word!
He did it again!

285
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,270
Why does the word "of"
sometimes count in the acronym

286
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,269
and sometimes not?

287
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:11,311
Shut up, Mel! Your kids live
in Nebraska with your mom.

288
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,937
CROWD: (chanting)
No more trophies! No more trophies!

289
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,315
Uh-oh.

00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,612

-Burn in hell!

292
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,947
Kill him with G.R.I.T.!

293
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,622
Hi, Homer.
How's the trophy business?

294
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,464
Nobody wants them anymore,
thanks to G.R.I.T.

295
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,090
Stupid parenting method
I can't exploit for money.

296
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,669
Actually kinda makes sense.

297
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,384
Hate it so much.

298
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,014
(Homer gasps)

299
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,340
I know that.

300
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,045
That's my dad's
old pocket watch.

301
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,635
How did you get it?

302
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,850
Oh, Grampa said I earned it.

303
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,970
I guess someone
in this family's proud of me.

304
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,137
Oh, you didn't want it, did you?

305
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,726
(scoffs)
Yeah, right.

306
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,651
That watch means
nothing to me.

307
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,610
Really? Then how do you
explain that case you made?

308
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:59,071
I built it to always remind me
of what not to want.

309
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,073
What about your
self-published novel?

310
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,115
Well, the character
of John Homer

311
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,239
is only partly based on me.

312
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,076
Well, if I didn't know better,
I'd say you were obsessed

313
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,252
with getting Grampa's watch.

314
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:14,171
Ooh, thanks for the analysis,
Dr. Freud.

315
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,921
Next you'll be telling me
that this whole trophy business,

316
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,924
and in fact, all my get-rich-quick
schemes over the years,

317
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,337
are borne of a desperate need
for approval

318
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,296
from a father
who couldn't show love.

319
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,427
Likely because
of his traumatic relationship

320
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:31,265
with his own father,
and his before him, and so on.

321
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,402
But, unfortunately, Dr. Freud,

322
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,820
that couldn't be further
from the truth, Doctor.

323
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,241
If you say so.

324
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,699
Now I'm gonna take this out
and see what life is like

325
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,080
with real love and encouragement
ticking in my pocket.

326
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,619
Stupid watch.

327
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,082
Doesn't even have a fob.

00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,676
-(thud)
-MILHOUSE: Ow!

347
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,314
Did you see
where the rock landed?

348
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,771
In my eye!

349
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,771
Oh. That watch was the only thing
that made me not terrible.

350
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,444
I can't lose it.

351
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,572
I'll drop another rock
a few feet to the left.

352
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,359
My other eye!

353
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,567
Ow!

354
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,986
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

355
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,496
Not a single one
has missed me!

356
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,877
What are you doing?

357
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,708
That expert at the school
said trophies are bad for kids.

358
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,255
It's all part of G.R.I.T.

359
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,970
No, no.

360
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,010
My trophies were earned.

361
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,603
Even the soccer one?

362
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,678
I went to most
of the practices.

363
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,225
Yeah, but what happens
when another parenting expert

364
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,349
comes along with a whole
new theory on self-esteem?

365
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,767
Another expert?

366
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,515
Who are they?
What are they saying?

367
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,066
Aw.

368
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,945
Okay, the watch is gone.

369
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,667
I guess I can live with being
a useless, worthless nothing

370
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,288
as long as no one finds out.

371
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,875
Sweetie, your grampa's
on the phone.

372
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:03,882
Hello.

373
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,303
Great news, kiddo.

374
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,591
<i>Remember That</i> magazine
is putting out

375
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,135
their annual
family heirlooms issue.

376
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,719
They want us for the cover.

377
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,974
You, me and the pocket watch.

378
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:14,926
Um...

379
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,225
It's a great story.

380
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,398
Passing a beloved heirloom
from grandfather to grandson.

381
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,728
A gift that restored
a child's faith in himself.

382
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,645
Uh, Grampa, there's something
I have to tell you.

383
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,784
Hold on one second.

384
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,400
I'm just finishing up

385
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,657
a mandatory
pre-article heart exam.

386
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,529
Doc says as long
as I don't suffer

387
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,696
any major disappointments,
I'll be fine.

388
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,496
Now, what did you want
to tell me?

389
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,749
Uh, helmets ruined football.

390
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,962
Exactly! If you want
to protect your head,

391
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,342
grow your hair long.

392
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,879
Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow
at 10:00 a.m.

393
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,433
And you won't be late
because you've got that watch.

394
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,838
(groans)

395
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,796
Stupid parenting experts.

396
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,966
Why don't they write a book
called <i>Stop Buying These Books?</i>

397
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,596
Everybody'd buy that.

398
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,563
Even if I was listening
to what you said, it doesn't matter.

399
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:01,854
Nothing matters.

400
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,517
My trophy business
has failed

401
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,565
and Bart has
the thing I wanted most:

402
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,189
Grampa's watch.

403
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,186
What watch?

404
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,607
The one you get
for being a success.

405
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,156
Well, then I should have it.

406
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,239
Uh, that never really came up.

407
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:17,584
All that's left to do now
is bring these to the needy.

408
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,790
Best I can do
is charge you ten dollars

409
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,424
to throw them
in my Dumpster.

410
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,250
How about I give you a trophy
that says "Best Pawn Shop"?

411
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,006
Not unless I earned it.

412
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,418
(gasps)

413
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,717
Dad's watch!

414
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,010
Hey, dirtbag shopkeep,

415
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,603
how did this come to you?

416
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,098
Mm.
Some kid brought it in.

417
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,890
Said he was mad
at his friend

418
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,693
for dropping so many rocks
in his eye.

419
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,769
That dude's seen
a lot of living.

420
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,321
Yours for 20 bucks.

421
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,779
That's an insult.

422
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,149
You're talking about
a self-worth-boosting antique

423
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,656
that's been in my family
for generations.

424
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,989
Twenty-two?

425
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,164
You'll take it all,
and you'll like it.

426
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,833
(maniacal laugh)

427
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,536
Yes. I have it.

428
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,166
Some said it would never happen.

429
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,172
Most were unaware
of the situation.

430
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,224
But I finally have
my father's watch!

431
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,299
(maniacal laugh)

432
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,272
(singsongy) Oh, Bart,
look what Daddy's got now.

433
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,599
(Bart crying)

434
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,559
{\an8}Grampa was the only person
who believed in me.

435
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,148
{\an8}But when he finds out
I lost the watch,

436
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,444
{\an8}even he'll give up.

437
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,607
{\an8}(sobbing)

438
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,744
Stay strong, Homer.

439
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,491
Don't go soft on him now.

440
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,122
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
face-rubbing-in.

441
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,870
Mm. Come on, foot.

442
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,042
Kick, damn you!

443
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
(grunts)

444
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,962
{\an8}(sighs) Son, I found something
that belongs to you.

445
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,883
(gasps) Grampa's watch!

446
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,882
No. I can't take it.

447
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,974
I didn't earn it,
so I don't deserve it.

448
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,339
You were right.

449
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,885
I am a screw-up.

450
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,559
But, boy,
who screwed you up?

451
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,429
(gasps) You.

452
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,136
It was you.

453
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,936
And those who came before.

454
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,069
(choking loudly)

455
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,073
It's stuck in your hand fat.

456
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:20,275
Oh. You got to wedge something
in there to break the vacuum.

457
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,037
(grunting)

458
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,497
Okay.

459
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,632
Smile, my little watch watcher.

460
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,665
(camera clicking)

461
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,432
That was a nice thing you did.

462
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,931
Which parenting guide
told you to do it?

463
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,974
Well, baby,
sometimes you just

464
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,227
got to trust your gut.

465
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,646
(watch shatters)

466
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,443
(choking)

467
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,586
It's NBA draft day,
and the world waits to see

468
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,011
who will be the first pick.

469
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,509
The consensus choice
is Cody Harris from LSU,

470
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,552
but there's an exciting
dark horse this year.

471
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,306
It's a player from Springfield
by the name of Ralph Wiggum.

472
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,468
Uh-oh.

473
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,556
There's no tape

474
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,061
on this three-foot-six
second-grader,

475
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,062
but he does lead
the nation in trophies.

476
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,944
You can't argue
with trophies.

477
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,731
Boom! Kid's a winner.

478
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,734
(groans)

479
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,946
From the Springfield Elementary
Afterschool Happy Hamsters,

480
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:41,988
the Philadelphia 76ers select
Ralph Wiggum, power forward.

481
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,834
I'm a millionaire!

482
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,001
