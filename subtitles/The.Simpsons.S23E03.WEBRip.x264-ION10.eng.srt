unflavored dental floss

that candy goes to...

Our fighting
men and women overseas.

17
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,429
It's our way of letting them know
we're having fun back here.

18
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,522
No sneaking off and eating
that candy yourself.

19

I'd never do that.

20
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,774
I'm too scared
of the evil switch witch.

21
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,774

and mate for life.

349
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,006
Don't you mean tentacles?

350
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,676
I know what I said!

351
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,564
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

352
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,851
(zapping)

353
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,479
Today you are a man.
Mazel Tov!

354
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,815
So... was it okay?

355
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,485
It was serviceable!

356
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:35,333
Ah, man, back on Earth
we don't have so many moons.

357
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,501
What do you mean,
"back on Earth"?

358
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,500
Uh... it's a place on the other
side of this planet that's...

359
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,255
very rainy so you can only see
one moon.

360
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,588
You know, like Portland.

361
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,883
I never hear of this Port-land.

362
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:54,217
But on Rigel Seven, lack of eye contact
and too many details

363
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,724
indicate the telling of truth.

364
00:16:56,807 --> 00:17:00,057
I love you, sugar-slime.

365
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,064
(smooching)

366
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,016
Man, you are full
of surprises.

367
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,856
(squawking)

368
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:09,241
I can't believe I'm getting
combat pay for this.

369
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:13,069
Well done, young man!
Our daughter is with child.

370
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,157
Here.

371
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:17,241
Feel the wonder of
one million fetuses!

372
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:20,247
(grunts) You said you
were using birth control!

373
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,830
That only keeps me from giving birth
while we are having sex.

374
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,537
(moans)

375
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,417
How do those mountains float?

376
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,924
They don't.
They are falling.

377
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:33,427
Now that Kamala
has a slug in the oven,

378
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:37,680
we must make sure she gets
her daily dose of Hilarium.

379
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:41,765
Without it, her crankiness
will become unbearable.

380
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:45,692
Unfortunately our environment
is too hostile to grow pickles.

381
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:49,233
And the only flavor ice cream
we have is butter brickle.

382
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,528
To repeat: no pickles,
butter brickle.

383
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,783
It is the Rigelian way.

384
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,945
So, where can I load up on this
Hilarium?

385
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,794
Listen closely.

386
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:03,709
The Hilarium is found in the
sacred secretions of the queen!

387
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,300
(dialing phone)

388
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,971
We have located the Hilarium.

389
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,220
Lock in on my signal.

390
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:19,392
Traitor! How dare you betray
the planet I got laid on?!

391
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,100
They're all in one place.
Let's fry these calamari

392
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,727
and dip 'em in a sauce made
of their own blood!

393
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,895
And wine from
their own grapes.

394
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,193
That's not so bad.

395
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,856
It's a little bad.

396
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,196
So Kamala, where do we keep all
our tanks and planes and stuff?

397
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,997
We have no tanks.
Our planet will protect us.

398
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,213
Oh, man,
you sound like my art teacher.

399
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,713
Look a little like her, too.

400
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,165
(snarling)

401
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,336
(bellowing)

402
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,935
(shouting)

403
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,308
(growling)

404
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,150
(squawking)

405
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,240
(yelling)

406
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,579
(hooting)

407
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:26,371
(battle cry)

408
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,166
I guess this is a good time
to tell you

409
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,090
I've been a double agent
all this time.

410
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,919
But now I am
totally on your side.

411
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,764
And this is a good time to tell you
I have space warts.

412
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,511
And I got them
from Milhouse.

413
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,513
(gasps)

414
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,055
Time for a good old-fashioned

415
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,273
servo-suit/bulldozer-saurus fight!

416
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,320
(grunting)

417
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,695
(growling)

418
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,120
Dammit!

419
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,619
Yo, Colonel! Uh, you've got
some schmutz on your cheek.

420
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,041
Where? Here?

421
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,660
Skinner...!

422
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,249
Had they asked
for the Hilarium,

423
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,586
we would simply have
given it to them.

424
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:18,381
In Rigelian there is no word
for "yours" or "mine."

425
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,677
That's the reason we didn't
enjoy the movie

426
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,221
<i>Yours, Mine and Ours.</i>

427
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,224
(somber music plays)

428
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,273
Halloween is over,
which means, America,

429
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,563
it's time to start your
Christmas shopping.

430
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:35,227
Infuse our stagnant economy
with dollars you don't really have.

431
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:39,657
And whatever you do, avoid the urge
to make homemade gifts.

432
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:44,828
Knitting one sweater for someone
costs 27 Americans their jobs.

433
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,330
{\an8}And don't forget,
Christmas is a wonderful time

434
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,082
{\an8}to take up alcoholism.

435
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,384
{\an8}Come on, you see your
family all year round.

436
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,498
{\an8}The holidays are for
your bartender. (laughs)

437
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,506
{\an8}("Carol of the Bells" plays)

438
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:04,391
{\an8}When are we doing
the <i>Black Swan?</i>

439
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,271
{\an8}(moans)

440
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,480
(scream)

441
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,152
(spooky organ music plays)

442
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,988
