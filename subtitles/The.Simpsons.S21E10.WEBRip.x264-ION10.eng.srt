{\an8}Real humor comes from people

{\an8}Aw, come on, Marge.

26
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,765
{\an8}There's nothing funnier than
a good old bonk on the head.

{\an8}-I concur.
-D'oh!

-Not funny.

{\an8}Good night kids, and don't

{\an8}MAN:
That's a wrap!

31
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,899
{\an8}And you kids
in the studio audience,

32
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,317
{\an8}please hand back all the hats,
toys, and savings bonds

33
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,736
{\an8}I passed out during the taping.

{\an8}(kids exclaiming sadly)

35
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,667
{\an8}Great show, Krusty.

36
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,578
{\an8}Terrific!
We've got to make changes.

37
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,917
{\an8}Big changes.

38
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,711
{\an8}These are your ratings
with young girls.

39
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,255
{\an8}Hey, if my writers knew
how to appeal to girls,

40
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,629
{\an8}they wouldn't
be writers.

41
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:16,676
{\an8}First of all, we <i>love </i>being
in the Krusty business.

42
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:19,471
{\an8}The subtitle:
"We don't trust you at all."

43
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,516
{\an8}Anyway, we're giving you
a new female costar

44
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,019
{\an8}-and she starts Monday.
-What?!

45
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,731
{\an8}A new costar?!

46
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,231
{\an8}Suppose I refuse to go along
with this?

47
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,073
{\an8}Then we've got
an entire reality show

48
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,109
{\an8}all set to pick
the new you.

49
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,702
{\an8}Hey, hey!
I'm non-union!

50
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,818
{\an8}Okay, okay. Change the show
however you want!

51
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,155
{\an8}Make it exactly like the
other crap on your network,

52
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,161
{\an8}but just let me stay!

53
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,913
{\an8}(sobs):
Just don't fire me.

54
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,076
{\an8}Now <i>that's </i>groveling.

55
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,455
{\an8}Time to try out
my new deep fryer.

56
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,042
{\an8}Who wants fresh doughnuts?

57
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,497
{\an8}-Me! Me! Me-me-me!
-Me! Me! Me-me-me!

58
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,047
{\an8}And I even got
rainbow sprinkles.

59
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,181
{\an8}Some rainbow--
there's no violet.

60
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,548
{\an8}Then don't have any.

61
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,934
{\an8}Hey, don't listen to me!

62
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,221
{\an8}What do I know
about rainbows?

63
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,354
{\an8}(smacking lips)
Mmm.

64
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,680
{\an8}None for me, Marge.

65
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,314
{\an8}I get free doughnuts at work.

66
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,481
{\an8}I can see them now.

67
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,689
{\an8}In the break room,
beside the fridge,

68
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,649
{\an8}the pink cardboard box awaits.

69
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,770
{\an8}Groaning with a "United Nations"
of doughnuts:

70
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,358
{\an8}jellies rubbing elbows
with cream-filled,

71
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,954
{\an8}the masculine contours
of the box juxtaposed

72
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,910
{\an8}with the feminine curves
of the treats themselves.

73
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,535
{\an8}Why didn't you
try to stop him?

74
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,699
{\an8}I did, once.

75
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,327
{\an8}(humming happily)

76
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,464
{\an8}(exclaims)

77
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,670
{\an8}No pink box?

78
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,080
{\an8}Wha-What's going on?

79
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,998
{\an8}I'm afraid your daily
doughnuts are no more.

80
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,217
{\an8}You. Can't. Do. That.

81
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,298
{\an8}Until Mr. Roosevelt's
New Deal starts working,

82
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,643
{\an8}this country's still
in a depression.

83
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,888
{\an8}I'm spending
a fortune on atoms,

84
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,060
{\an8}and we have to cut costs.

85
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,598
{\an8}But we have
way more expensive

86
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,141
{\an8}unnecessaries
than doughnuts.

87
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,935
{\an8}Yeah, like the ceiling
furniture.

88
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,308
{\an8}Or all the joke ID badges
we order.

89
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,515
{\an8}No doughnuts!

90
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,685
{\an8}-No!
-D'oh!

91
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,613
{\an8}Nuts!

92
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,030
{\an8}Exactly.

93
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,400
{\an8}Hey! Hey!

94
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,407
{\an8}But seriously,
hey, hey, kids.

95
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,819
{\an8}A word about today's show.

96
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,237
{\an8}The network "geniuses"

97
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,826
{\an8}with the ink still drying
on their MBAs...

98
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,792
{\an8}(derisive laughter)

99
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,882
{\an8}...think your old pal Krusty
should share his limelight

100
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,039
{\an8}with an up-and-coming new star.

101
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,047
{\an8}Let's give a respectful
welcome

102
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,469

Easy there,
Habitrail.

130
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,883
They took away
our doughnuts at work.

131
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,426
-All I've had are my meals.
-And the worst thing is,

132
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,010
there's nothing
we can do about it.

133
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,345
I think that's
the best thing

134
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,770
'cause then you
can say, "Well,

135
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,428
there's nothing
we can do about it."

136
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,266
Bartender, buy these men
a round on me.

137
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,273
You want to
"buy a round?"

138
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,065
I heard about that
in bartending school,

139
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,028
but I never seen it happen.

140
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,988
Oh, this is very good for me.

141
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,489
Very good indeed.

I'm a corporate recruiter

146
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,663
who specializes
in nuclear workers.

147
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,955
I guess these days,
headhunters can be anything.

148
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,340
You nuclear workers have no idea
how valuable you are.

149
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,958
Times have never been better
for your industry,

150
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,295
now that all the protesters
who marched in front

151
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,971
of nuclear power plants
are dying off

152
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,379
from radiation poisoning.

153
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,717
Are these business cards

154
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,683
or passports to a better future?

155
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,643
-Those are business cards.
-Nice.

156
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,095
Krusty, thanks
to Princess Penelope,

157
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,685
your studio audience is packed.

158
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,520
And we didn't need
any cardboard kids.

159
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,936
Yeah, but they're
all girls.

160
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,315
Girls don't laugh,
and they don't buy cigars.

161
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,243
Dutch Masters is gonna

00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,858
Poor Krusty.

175
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,229
He's become the lowest form
of life: a sidekick.

176
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,896
You said it, Bart.

177
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,235
Way to sum up the situation.

178
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,899
Take it easy, little buddy.

179
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,988
That's exactly
how I'll take it.

180
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,672
-Wanna come in
and get your sister with me?
-Hell, no.

181
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,628
Watch your language.
Now, why the hell not?

182
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,959
Ah, <i>The Krusty Show</i>
sucks now.

183
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,884
It's all pink and princessy.

184
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,053
Why are great things
always ruined by women?

185
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,012
The Army, the Fantastic Four.

186
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,842
Think how awesome
<i>American Idol</i>

187
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,257
would be with just
Simon and Randy.

188
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,305
(chuckles)

189
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,809
Oh, Bart, you say that now.

190
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,141
But when you're grown-up,
you'll just think it.

191
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,896
Now you stay here
and I'll get your sister.

192
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,228
(humming)

193
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,023
Princess Penelope,
sign mine, sign mine!

194
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,744
(gasps)

195
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,572
What the...?!

196
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,115
Where's all your Krusty stuff?

197
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,123
Right through
that magical door.

198
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,249
(gasps)

199
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,424
<i>Ay carumba!</i>

200
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,592
(groans)

201
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,384
Krusty?

202
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,007
Snap out of it!

203
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,554
You're Krusty the Clown.

204
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,678
One of <i>Look </i>magazine's
hundred most-promising clowns

205
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,385
of 1958.

206
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,095
A lot of suicides
in that group.

207
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,556
Funny suicides (chuckles),
but still.

208
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,898
My day is over, kid.

209
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,532
What are you talking about?

210
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,109
Whose name is on that sign?

211
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,525
D'oh!

212
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:56,945
-(Krusty doll laughing)
-Hey, how'd this one
get way over here?

213
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,329
That's it. I've hit rock-bottom.

214
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,336
Well, my comeback starts now.

215
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,168
I mean, now. Ow!

216
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,796
Let me start by getting
out of the Dumpster.

217
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,513
Oh, why do clown things
always happen to clowns?

218
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,193
Now other nuclear plants
let their employees

219
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,321
tape Gary Larson cartoons
on their workstations.

220
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,819
But here at Cap City Nuclear,
you can actually see...

221
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,072
Gary Larson.

222
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,569
Gary Larson?!
I thought you retired.

223
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,986
I was retired

224
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,374
until I got the call
from Capital City Nuclear,

225
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,001
offering me the chance to be

226
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,708
the in-house cartoonist
at a nuclear plant.

227
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,208
Gary, why don't you whip up
an instant classic

228
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,001
-for my friends here?
-You got it, Gator.

229
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:53,717
Man, a lion would not want
to see that on his X-ray.

230
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,810
(New York accent):
Where are you? Where?

231
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:01,728
You're not even in Nassau County
anymore. You're in Suffolk.

232
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,809
Look, look, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

233
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:05,765
You're going the wrong way.

234
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,895
-(knocking)
-Hold on.

235
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,401
(lilting voice):
Coming!

236
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,902
Now see here,
Little Miss Scene Stealer,

237
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,395
I'm the star of this show.

238
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,526
You're just the reason
people tune in.

239
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,874
(New York accent):
Krusty, there's something
I have to tell you.

240
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,949
No, no! Let me finish:

241
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,825
I work like I drink: alone.

242
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,121
Or with a monkey watching me.

243
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,584
Krusty... I love you.

244
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,625
That way, if I pass out,
he turns me on my side so...

245
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,920
You what?!

246
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:32,973
I have loved you since
I was a 12-year-old girl,

247
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,719
in Mineola, Long Island,
watching your show.

248
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,431
WDQT?

249
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,971
They had this fat,
pathetic station manager.

250
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,806
-That was my father.
-Great guy.

251
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,851
I still have my
Krusty Klub ring.

252
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:48,805
I wasn't popular because I was
more beautiful and friendly

253
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,068
than everyone else,

254
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,729
but whenever I looked
at this ring,

255
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,947
I knew I had one friend.

256
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,409
You know those rings came
with a membership card.

257
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,236
That's the one.

258
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,750
Oh, my God.

259
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,459
Please don't tell me I died
on the operating table again.

260
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,500
You didn't.

261
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,963
This is real, Krusty.

262
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,554
(nervous chuckle)

263
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:24,269
Welcome to
the <i>Krusty and Princess Penelope</i>

<i>Smoochie-Poo I Love You Hour.</i>

265
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,146
No laughs, just
hugs and cuddles.

266
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,560
Don't worry.

267
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,018
Mr. Teeny's got
a flaming arrow.

268
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,159

Whether she was competing
in equestrian events

282
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:24,702
at the 1976 Olympics or spending
her summers at Holyrood Palace,

Princess Anne is truly
a world leader.

284
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,040
Okay, so far, for
"Inspirational Women Day"

285
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,548
we've had one Princess Anne,
15 Dianas,

286
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,760
two baby Princess
Ingrid Alexandras of Norway,

287
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,012
and one Princess Leia.

I don't care what anyone says.
Massages are relaxing.

291
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,816
Now if you boys sign up
with Cap City Nuclear,

292
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,070
you'll get weekly massages,

293
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,401
plus free sushi
right through the face hole.

294
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,831
Sir, I have some
unsettling news:

295
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,912
three of our workers
are being poached.

296
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,367
The heart
of our tug-of-war team.

297
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,037
No. No, this is our year.
How can this be happening?

298
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,496
Sir, I'm afraid your
doughnut-cutting measures,

299
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,217
while reasonable, were
perceived as draconian.

300
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,468
Comparing me to old Draco, eh?

301
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,641
I'll have to do
something about this.

302
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,472
(cracking)

303
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,185

Thank God.

309
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,711
I'm sick and tired
of this woman...

310
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,003
Yes!

311
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,626
...not being married to me.

312
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,012
Huh?

313
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,129
Penelope, will you be
my princess bride?

314
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:09,064
Oh, Krusty, yes! Yes!

315
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,769
(trilling high note)

316
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,020
That's it. Game over.

317
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,442
Is it, Bart? Is it?

318
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,811
What are you talking about?

319
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,687
A wedding is a
complex thing, Bart.

320
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,315
It's so easy for
something to go wrong.

321
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,783
(gasps)

322
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,623
Milhouse Van Houten,
will you do me the honor

323
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,699
of ruining Krusty's
wedding with me?

324
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,914
Oh, Bart, this is
all happening so fast.

325
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,786
Let's call my mom together.

326
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,965
Goodbye, power plant.

327
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,888
(sobbing)
I'd better get out of here
before I have a meltdown.

328
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,849
If I hadn't had to work in you,
we might've been friends.

329
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,521
So long.

330
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,476
Oh, right.

331
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,568
(all gasping)

332
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,859
Gentlemen.

333
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,824
Please don't leave me.

334
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,736
Sir, I'm afraid
it's too late.

335
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,414
Oh, I imagine Cap City's
been wooing you

336
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,953
with trips to the seashore,

337
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,247
a Christmas goose,
Spanish lemons,

338
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,671
folderol I can't
afford to match.

339
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,379
But please, accept this
little going-away present.

340
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,801
(scoffs)

341
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,589
You can't win us back
with mere doughnuts.

342
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,223
Oh, but these aren't
just any doughnuts.

343
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,351
These doughnuts were made
the old-fashioned way:

344
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,769
the dough is sweetened
with Cuban sugar

345
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:36,688
from pre-Batista plantations,
then it's deep-fried

346
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,939
in the tallow of three
different animals,

347
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,111
two of which are now extinct.

348
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,900
Hmm?

349
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,819
(Delibes' "The Flower Duet"
playing)

350
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:53,076
That is the most amazing
doughnut I've ever tasted.

351
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,910
Well, if you stay on at the
Springfield Nuclear Plant,

352
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,246
you could have one of these
tasty beauties every day.

353
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,632
(groans)

354
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,459
One of these every day
might kill us.

355
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,554
Can we get a health plan
to go with them?

356
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,800
Sure, you can have
a health plan...

357
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,882
or two doughnuts a day.

358
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,888
(moaning ecstatically)

359
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,061
Move over, Brangelina.

360
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,309
Take a backseat,
Queen Latifarod.

361
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,312
Because today belongs
to "Krustelope."

362
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,435
This is the 15th marriage
for Krusty,

363
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,402
and the first for
"Princess Penelope,"

364
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,032
who is not, in fact,
a real princess.

365
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,859
Her actual name is:

366
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:31,244
Penelope Mountbatten Hapsburg
Hohenzollern Mulan-Pocahontas.

367
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,406
(singing in Hebrew)

368
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,841
(clearing throat)

369
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,921
Well, let's do the ceremony.

370
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,297
("Bridal March" playing)

371
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,427
Friends, loved ones,
we are gathered here today

372
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,225
to marry a Jew and a...

373
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,599
Congregationalist--
is that even a thing?

374
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,148
And now, let's continue
with this mockery.

375
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,862
Hmm? Hmm?

376
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,532
You're not my ring bearer.

377
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,070
What happened to the monkey?

378
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,494
I locked him in the Torah room.

379
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,872
(chattering)

380
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,740
Kid, what's your angle?

381
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,947
I'm trying to seal
the deal over here.

382
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,168
Princess, before
you marry Krusty,

383
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,328
there's someone
you should meet.

384
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,786
Holly Hippie.

385
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:28,126
Krusty's sidekick in 1969
and his first wife.

386
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,093
He wouldn't let me watch
the moon landing.

387
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:33,094
I was jealous of
Neil Armstrong.

388
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,047
And his last wife,
Eartha Kitt,

389
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,007
recorded this before
her untimely death.

390
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,427
They were only married
for six hours,

391
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,386
but she still hated Krusty.

392
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,897
<i>He was asleep for</i>
<i>five of those hours.</i>

393
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:47,439
And the one he was awake,
was a cat-tastrophe.

394
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,534
(snarling)

395
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,109
Wow, wow, this is
such an eye-opener.

396
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:56,156
I am blown away by how little
this bothers me.

397
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,041
I really love this guy.

398
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:02,788
And you are the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

399
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,543
And that's why
I can't marry you.

400
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,206
This kid and his ugly
sister are right.

401
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,795
I won't be good
enough for ya.

402
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,050
You can never
disappoint me.

403
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,723
I know your past--
your mug shots,

404
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:19,393
your bowling alley shoe spray
addiction, your country album.

405
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,773
They don't bother me.

406
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,519
They don't?

407
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,141
Don't you love me?

408
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:32,027
Princess, you're the only
woman I care about enough

409
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,571
to ditch at the altar.

410
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,204
Okay, Krusty,

411
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,370
if that's how you feel.

412
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,409
We'll always have
Sideshow Mel's dressing room.

413
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,664

No, it wasn't.
