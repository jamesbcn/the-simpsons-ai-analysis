00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,022
D'oh! (screams)

12
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,909
-(all grunt)
-Ha-ha!

13
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:32,678
{\an8}Hey, Bart, what's your favorite thing
about teachers' conference day?

14
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,009
{\an8}Mmm, I guess that
we don't have to go to school.

15
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,005
{\an8}Wow! Mine too!

16
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,177
{\an8}The world is completely
different on a weekday morning.

17
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,766
{\an8}Banks are open. Old people
are walking the streets with impunity.

18
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,403
{\an8}And look! Barney's not even drunk yet.

19
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,031
{\an8}Morning, boys. Can't stop to chat.

20
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,279
{\an8}Time is money.

21
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,319
HOMER: Morning, Barney.

22
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,863
{\an8}You know what makes it even sweeter?

23
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,618
{\an8}While we're out havin' fun
and walkin' around like crazy,

24
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,870
{\an8}those teachers are cooped up
in school like morons! (laughing)

25
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,455
Mmm, here we go again.

26
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,501
(all laughing, whooping)

27
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,634
Skinner!

28
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:14,432
{\an8}Ah. No day would be completely wasted
without a visit

29
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,929
to the old joke shop.

30
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,808
-(buzzing)
-(gasping)

31
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,059
(chuckles) Rookie mistake, Milhouse.

32
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,643
(groans)

33
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,740
Check it out, Bart. X-ray specs!

34
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,573
Hey, these don't work.

35
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,451
Uh-oh, a lead shirt.

36
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,535
{\an8}I'll take three pairs.
Here's my prescription.

37
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,251
{\an8}BART: Hmm.

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,010
{\an8}You wanna not play with that.
Just got it charged.

39
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,298
{\an8}Maybe you can help me.

40
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,721
{\an8}I don't think my face
is as hilarious as it could be.

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,720
{\an8}What can you show me in a nose
or forehead accessory?

42
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,263
{\an8}(bell jingling)

43
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,142
{\an8}Whoa! Lookin' sharp!

44
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,393
{\an8}(in squeaky voice)
Well, thanks, guv'nor. Oh!

45
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,225
{\an8}If you put dog doo on the suction cups,
they'll stick better.

46
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,435
{\an8}Milhouse, I'm not gonna take dog doo

47
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,195
{\an8}that's been on the dirty ground
and put it on my face.

48
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,358
{\an8}I have a better idea.

49
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,696
(bird squawking)

50
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:23,041
-(both grunting)
-(snoring)

51
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,829
-Hey, Dad, wake up!
-Huh? What? (muttering)

52
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,374
I'm awake! I'm awake!
I'm a productive member of the team.

53
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,998
You can't fire me! I quit!

54
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:33,764
-Please! I have a family.
-Relax, Dad, it's just me.

55
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,798
{\an8}I was wondering if you had any
industrial-strength adhesive

56
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,342
{\an8}I could use on my face.

57
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,045
Well, let's see what we got
in the old drawer.

58
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,683
(humming)

59
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,434
Eh. Eh.

60
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:49,095
Aha! There's some glue. (straining)

61
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,194
Hope this stuff holds.

62
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,485
LISA: This exhibit is
a once-in-a-lifetime event.

63
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,492
{\an8}It's the first time

64
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,873
{\an8}these Egyptian artifacts
have been allowed out of England.

65
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,911
Just let me put some film in the camera,
and then we'll hop in the car.

66
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:09,955
You can get a picture of your mommy
with a mummy. (giggling)

67
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:14,551
Whoops! There goes
Carlsbad Caverns. Oh, well.

68
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,049
Oh, I can't wait! In just 20 minutes,

69
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:20,511
we'll be in a three-hour line
to see the Orb of Isis.

70
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,175
Ta-da! Notice anything new?

71
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,103
Bart, what have I told you about
throwing money away at that joke shop?

72
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:31,653
-To try and cut back a little?
-(groans) Take those silly things off.

73
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,359
(grunting)

74
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,900
-It won't come off.
-(grunting)

75
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,780
(groaning)

76
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:46,155
Ow! Ow! Ow!

77
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,624
-Bart, did you glue those on?
-Oh, don't be ridiculous.

78
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:56,252
MARGE: "In case of accidental ingestion,
consult a mortician."

79
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,257
Oh, my goodness!

80
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,179
Mom, I didn't eat any of it.
I'm not stupid.

81
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,429
We've gotta get you
to a doctor right away.

82
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,097
Ow! Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

83
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,852
Wait! You promised
to take me to the museum!

84
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:13,354
I know, honey, but this is
a very unusual situation.

85
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,898
At least, it would be for most families.

86
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,612
-What if I took a bus?
-A bus?

87
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,203
Alone? Absolutely not.

88
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,569
It's just too dangerous
for an eight-year-old.

89
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,946
In a few years when you're old
enough to drive,

90
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,704
then you can take a bus.

91
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,831
But it's the last day of the Isis exhibit!

92
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:35,424
Well, you should've thought of that
before I glued all this stuff to my face.

93
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,541
Na!

94
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,683
-(snoring)
-(phone ringing)

95
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,219
(muttering) Y'ello?

96
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,264
{\an8}-Dad?
-Who is this?

97
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,098
{\an8}It's Lisa. I just called to tell you
how much I love you.

98
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,104
-And can I take the bus to the museum?
-Museum?

99
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,727
{\an8}Mmm, I don't like the sound of that.
What did your mother say?

100
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,815
Um, I wasn't 100% clear on that.

101
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,402
{\an8}She said something,

102
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,197
{\an8}but she was kind of in a rush
to get Bart to the emergency room.

103
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:08,331
{\an8}Hmm. So you wanna take the bus, huh?

104
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,160
{\an8}I don't know.
That's a pretty big decision.

105
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:15,035
{\an8}Well, if it would put your mind at ease,
I could take a limousine.

106
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,964
<i>Although, that would cost $200.</i>

107
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,714
$200? Oh! Isn't there any other way?

108
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,718
{\an8}Hmm. I guess I could take the bus
if you think that's a better idea.

109
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,432
{\an8}Frankly, I do.

110
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,722
{\an8}I know you had your heart set on a limo,

111
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,556
{\an8}but sometimes daddies
have to say no, honey.

112
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,942
<i>I'm afraid you're gonna</i>
<i>have to take the bus.</i>

113
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,056
(sighs) All right.

114
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,896
-HOMER: <i>Attagirl. I love you--</i>
-Yes!

115
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,409
Ah, the old number 22.

116
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,988
Clean, reliable public transportation.

117
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,534
{\an8}The chariot of the people.

118
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,497
{\an8}The ride of choice for the poor
and very poor alike.

119
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,958
{\an8}-Sure, some folks prefer--
-Are you getting on this next bus, kid?

120
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,460
-Yes.
-(whistles) Taxi!

121
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,762
{\an8}-V.D. clinic.
-(gasps) Look!

122
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,629
It's the bus! The bus! Come on!
You're gonna miss the bus!

123
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,256
(brakes squeal softly)

124
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,603
(chattering, shouting)

125
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,599
That's one small step-- Whoa!

126
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,387
Hi, Larry.

127
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,272
I'm sorry. It's just that
on the school bus--

128
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,606
May I sit there?

129
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,617
Of course not, honey.

130
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,529
That seat's for my coin purse.

131
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,463
May I have that seat?

132
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:39,418
Yes, if you can answer me
these questions three.

133
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,037
-Question the first--
-Never mind.

134
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,465
DRIVER(on speaker): <i>Sycamore Avenue.</i>

135
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,512
<i>Little Newark. Little Newark.</i>

136
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:53,184
- <i>Crackton. Crackton is the stop.</i>
-(siren wailing)

137
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,887
LISA: Crackton? That doesn't sound right.

138
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,443
DRIVER: <i>Industrial Access Road.</i>

139
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,231
<i>Airport Refueling Way.</i>

140
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,662
<i>Rural Route 9.</i>

141
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,454
<i>Army Proving Ground.</i>

142
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:15,162
Um, excuse me, sir? When does this bus
get to the museum?

143
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,874
-It doesn't.
-Oh. But isn't this the 22?

144
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,956
Yeah, Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

145
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,294
Tuesday, Thursday, it's the 22-A.

146
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,627
22-A? Then where the heck am I?

147
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,763
DRIVER: Don't make me tap the sign.

148
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
But I'm lost and I need to know where--

149
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,890
Last stop. End of the line.

150
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,648
LISA (sighs): I should've got off
in Crackton.

151
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,781
OK, the museum's gotta be north of here.

152
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,071
-Now, which way is north?
-(birds squawking)

153
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:55,905
Aha! It's springtime,
so the geese must be flying back north!

154
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:58,905
Hey!

155
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,502
(squawking aggressively)

156
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,221
See, Bart? There's another boy
who played with glue.

157
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:16,432
Actually, it was a plumbing explosion.

158
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,926
Ugh!

159
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,885
That's the kind of faucet
I want for your bathroom.

160
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,897
(sighs) How could I confuse
bus 22 with 22-A?

161
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,818
Area 51? (chuckles)

162
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,860
I found Area 51!

163
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,904
No, ma'am. This is Area 51-A.

164
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,278
{\an8}(grunts) Well, um, I'm kind of lost.

165
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,946
Can you tell me where I am?

166
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,794
I'm sorry. The location
of this location is classified.

167
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,749
(groans)

168
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,876
Stupid bus! It can't even go

169
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,505
to the stupid place
it's supposed to stupid go!

170
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,755
{\an8}(groans)

171
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,675
I seen it first! Ooh!

172
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:02,604
Girlie Sue's gonna have
a elegant weddin' feast.

173
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,475
Uh-huh. (forced chuckle)

174
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,612
Uh, listen, I'm kind of lost.

175
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,900
Do you think you could
give me a lift downtown?

176
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,114
Cletus, what are you beatin'
your gums about?

177
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,534
Never you mind, Brandine.

178
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,624
You just go back to birthin' that baby.

179
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,160
Yeah, I'll fetch ya a ride, little missy.

180
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:24,124
-Hop on in. Mind the skunk.
-(insects buzzing)

181
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:28,036
Them things can go off
even after they's dead.

182
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,707
(gags)

183
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,585
(baby crying)

184
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,720
Hmm.

185
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,679
Young man, there's nothing
funny about novelties.

186
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,814
(chuckles) I mean,
they're humorous and all,

187
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,152
but, uh, this is certainly
no laughing matter.

188
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,398
-(chuckling)
-(Marge groans)

189
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,651
-Can you help him, Doctor?
-Oh, my, yes.

190
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:56,574
Why, if I had $75 for
every novelty I've removed--

191
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,946
Oh, by the way, I'll need a check for $75.

192
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:03,405
Yes, I think a series
of painful injections

193
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,456
directly into Bart's spine
should get the job done.

194
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,631
(gasps)

195
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,465
(whimpering)

196
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,304
-Hmm?
-MARGE: What happened?

197
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,176
You didn't do anything.

198
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,272
Oh, didn't I? (chuckling)

199
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,019
Nothing dissolves glue
better than human sweat.

200
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,482
I knew Bart would panic
and start perspiring

201
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,312
at the sight of this button applicator.

202
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,440
Couldn't you have just
turned up the heat a little?

203
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,907
Oh, heavens, no!
It had to be terror sweat.

204
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:42,117
-(eating loudly)
-LENNY: Oh, yeah. This is good.

205
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,792
(indistinct muttering)

206
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,712
So, uh, ain't you guys
gonna ask me about my hat?

207
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,382
-Ah!
-Ah!

208
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,800
Hey, Carl, what's with the hat?

209
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,839
Oh, what, this thing?
I got it down at the museum.

210
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:00,094
It's what the ancient Egyptians
call a souvenir.

211
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,847
My daughter's at
that Egyptian dealie right now.

212
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,225
(laughs) She wanted to take a limo.

213
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,888
But I made her take the bus.

214
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,597
You sent your little girl downtown
on a bus?

215
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,558
Alone?

216
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,492
Maybe. But you don't know Lisa.
I mean, she's so smart

217
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,609
they hooked her up to a big computer
to try to teach it some things.

218
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,367
But she had so much knowledge,
it overloaded.

219
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,740
And then it got really hot
and caught on fire!

220
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,832
That never, uh, happened, did it, Homer?

221
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,080
Uh, yes.

222
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,207
But now I have to leave
on a totally unrelated matter.

223
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,514
Oh, Lisa!

224
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:42,431
(groans) I didn't know Springfield
had a Russian district.

225
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,471
Excuse me. Can you tell me
how to get to the museum?

226
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:50,226
{\an8}(shouting in foreign language)

227
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,271

00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,631

-No, thanks.
-(wailing)

236
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,301
(panting) Oh, that's it. I give up.

HOMER: You have reached

(tires screeching)

245
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,241
Lisa! Lisa!

246
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,576
Lisa!

247
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,122
(panting) Oh, where is she?

00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,626
-(horns honking)
-(tires screeching)

249
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,511
Has anyone seen my little girl?

250
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,474
Oh, for God's sakes,
my little girl is-- (gasps)

251
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,513
{\an8}(shrieks) Hello.

252
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,005
{\an8}Homer, what's going on?
Shouldn't you be at work?

253
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,058
-I am at work. This is what I do.
-But--

254
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,982
{\an8}Keep it moving, Marge!
This isn't a parking lot!

255
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,021
{\an8}I'm sorry.

256
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,442
Whew!

257
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,068
(screams)

258
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,399
-Shouldn't you be at work right now?
-Uh, yes, sir, Mr. Burns, sir.

259
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,196
Well, then get back to
wherever it is you work, whoever you are.

260
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,583
Excuse me, ma'am.
Have you seen this little girl?

261
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,371
Uh, I'd love to help you, pal,
but I'm on a stakeout here.

262
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,745
Yoink! Ha-ha!

263
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,962
Oh-Oh, great! Somebody stop that awful,
awful man!

264
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:40,915
Oh.

265
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,125
Lisa! Lisa!

266
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,642
{\an8}D'oh! This is no good.
I've gotta get up higher.

267
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,891
Give me all your balloons.

268
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,345
I hope this works.

269
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,441
These are for you if you let me use
your cherry picker.

270
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:58,188
Well, I've already got some balloons,
but they're not this nice.

271
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,482
Deal!

272
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,334
Excuse me, ma'am? Uh, hello?

273
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,247
Somebody? Anybody?

274
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,593
-Oh!
-Lisa?

275
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,958
Lisa? (gasps)

276
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,086
-Lisa!
-Dad!

277
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,013
Stay there! I'll come down and save you!

278
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,178
What's wrong with this thing? (gasping)

279
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,017
(yelling)

280
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,399
Lisa!

281
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,031
Save me!

282
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,899
(yelling)

283
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,618
Hang on, Dad!

284
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,616
(groaning)

285
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,873
D'oh! Ow!

286
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,877
(yelling)

287
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,710
-Ow!
-Look out!

288
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,383
Oh, no. I'm gonna go off the end of the--

289
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,680
D'oh! (indistinct shouting)

290
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,734
I'm not normally a praying man,
but if you're up there,

291
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,100
please save me, Superman.

292
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,607
(horn blowing)

293
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:29,203
-Hurry! Hurry! Lower the bridge!
-You're the boss.

294
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,826
LISA: Dad, grab onto it!

295
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,910
(whimpering)

296
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,329
(gasping) D'oh!

297
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:46,458
Ow! Oh, Lisa, thank God you're OK.

298
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,012
D'oh! Ow! D'oh! Ow!

299
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:53,182
-You said to crush him, right?
-No!

300
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,063
Are you sure you don't wanna
go to a doctor?

301
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,770
{\an8}I mean, a drawbridge
did close on your head.

302
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,101
Nah, I'll just walk it off.

303
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,361
I should have known I wasn't old enough
to take the bus alone,

304
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,653
but I really wanted to see that exhibit.

305
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,946
I'll never take another
stupid risk like that again.

306
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,872
(tires screeching)

307
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,950
-Don't ever say that!
-What?

308
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,827
If I hadn't have taken a stupid risk
with that cherry picker,

309
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,624
I never would've found you.

310
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,578
I guess.

311
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,417
Stupid risks
are what make life worth living.

312
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,673
Now, your mother, she's the steady type,

313
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,006
and that's fine in small doses.

314
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,761
But me, I'm a risk taker.

315
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,014
That's why I have so many adventures.

316
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,716
(gasps) Dad, you're headed
for the river again!

317
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,437
-Dad!
-HOMER: (chuckling)

318
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,348
Feel your heart pumping a mile a minute?

319
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,017
That's what my heart's doing all the time.

320
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,725
Bet your left arm's tingling too, huh?

321
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,567
Dad, are you all right?

322
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,862
I'm enjoying my life too much to care,

323
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,156
and you should be too.

324
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,949
So what would you like to do right now
more than anything in the world?

325
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,705
{\an8}See the Isis exhibit!
But the museum's closed.

326
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,829
Hmm. Closed, eh?

327
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,416
{\an8}So getting in would be a pretty big risk.

328
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,133
{\an8}What do you say, honey?
Feelin' stupid? I know I am!

329
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,545
(tires squealing)

330
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:20,433
Lisa, we're home! Sorry about the museum!

331
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:24,479
(groans) You'd better go up and apologize.

332
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,771
-But my apologies always sound so forced.
-Do it!

333
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,815
Hey, Lise, I'm sorry
I ruined your Egyptian thing.

334
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,866
We're still buds, right?

335
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,498
OK, be that way! Be a big, stupid jerk!

336
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:47,213
Oh! You're not the jerk. I am.

337
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,252
Forgive me?

338
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,087
Oh, like you're Miss Perfect!

339
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,178
Mom, Lisa's making me feel bad!

340
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,759
-MARGE: Stop it, Lisa!
-That shut her up.

341
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,817
HOMER: OK, just a little higher.

342
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,439
(both grunting softly)

343
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,067
Mmm.

344
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,699
Dad, I'm kind of scared.

345
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:24,495
Good. You're gonna need that adrenaline
to make the final jump.

346
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,870
(grunts)

347
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,000
OK. Here goes. (grunting)

348
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,172
Could you open the window?

349
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,335
The cops have Daddy's prints on file.

350
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,983
Wow! It's magnificent!

351
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,403
Now I know how Sir Dudley Winthrop felt

352
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,900
{\an8}when he first fell through the ceiling
and discovered the Temple of Isis.

353
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,698
{\an8}Have you ever seen
such exquisite ushabtis?

354
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,491
Uh, not this exquisite.

355
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,527
(gasps)

356
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:06,788
{\an8}Oh, my gosh! It's the mysterious
Orb of Isis.

357
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,754
Archaeologists have been
studying it for decades

358
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,173
and still have no clue what it means.

359
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,502
Well, Daddy will figure it out.

360
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,671
Oh! We can't touch it, Dad.

361
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,798
It's behind a velvet rope.

362
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,095
A <i>velvet </i>rope.

363
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:26,349
Lisa, you can't go this far
and then not go further.

364
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,312
(grunting, whimpering)

365
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,734
No!

366
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,732
Dad!

367
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,777
-(gasping)
-Uh-oh.

368
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,115
You broke it!

369
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,789
(chiming)

370
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,747
It's a music box.

371
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:55,092
{\an8}Dad, we uncovered the secret!

372
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,092
Oh! So now it's "we," eh?

373
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,553
It's so beautiful.

374
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,514
And just think, we are the first people
to hear its song

375
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,635
in more than 4,000 years.

376
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:10,595
Thanks for making me take
such a stupid risk, Dad.

377
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,186
Anytime, honey. Just remember,

378
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,072
never be afraid to live life on the edge.

379
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,646
Now, let's get home
before your mother kills us.

380
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,278
(music stops)

381
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,493
It's kind of humbling, isn't it?

382
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:27,293
The music we just heard
might never be heard again.

383
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,829
Yeah. But it'll always live on

384
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,213
because we'll never forget it.

385
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,211
(whistling)

386
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,671
-Dad, that's the Old Spice song.
-HOMER: It is?

387
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:42,085
Well, that's a good song too. (humming)

388
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,505
(both humming)

389
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,391
-(humming stops)
-(alarm blaring)

390
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,393
-HOMER: Run!
-(dogs barking)

391
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,385
(Lisa screaming)

392
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,807
(music box playing)

393
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,896
(theme music playing)

394
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,650
Shh!

395
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,661
