What have you found?

176
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,809
(gasps) I knew it was Bob!

177
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,895
Even when they tried
and executed Jailbird,

178
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,480
I knew it was Bob.

179
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,899
Reanimate?

180
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,026
This animation looks good enough to me.

181
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,413
Homer, pull the lever!

182
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,160

Wow, for once,
I was sober at Bart's birth.

185
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,289
Yes, that's right, Officer.

186
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,997
There are intruders in my basement.

187
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,457
Have I the right to shoot?

188
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,667
Oh, yeah.

189
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,837
And you can wear blue jeans
to a Broadway show.

190
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,046
Everything's different now.

That's for trying to frame Krusty!

196
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,568
What about all the times
he tried to kill me?!

197
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,652
Eh.

198
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,276
As the one who suffered
the most, Mom,

199
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,493
may I have custody of Bob's body?

200
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,123
Normally I'd say no,

201
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,200
but you have been showing
responsibility with the dog lately.

202
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,496
So, fine.

Now each grab one ankle

358
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,615
We have to be careful, Milhouse.

359
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,373
There's no telling what that stu...

360
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,455
Bart, what are you doing?!

361
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,040
Madam, how do you do?

362
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,377
You don't know what that stuff
is doing to you!

363
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,553
Oh, it's just the same junk
Dad brings us home from work.

364
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,802
To us Simpsons,
this green goop is mother's...

Where are my owls?

Oh, man, am I looking at a nosebleed.

368
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,524

Somehow, the radioactive explosion

369
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,774
gave us the power to move things
with our intellect.

370
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,900
Flowers for the lady?

(gasps, laughs)

372
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,119
Bart, what powers
did your brain give you?

373
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,409
Look,
you're talking to the guy that got demoted

374
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,163
from the Tadpoles reading group, okay?

375
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,424
Do not make me pity-fly.

377
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,415
You know,
we can't tell anyone about this.

378
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,336
There are going to be
lab tests and scientists...

379
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,844
Do we get to wear those paper gowns?

Ow!
