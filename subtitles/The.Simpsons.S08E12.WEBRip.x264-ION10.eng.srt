00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,746
{\an8}Good morning, sir.

8
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,248
{\an8}Care for some coffee?

9
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,039
{\an8}No, the promise
of a new day

10
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,793
{\an8}is more than enough
exhilaration for me.

14
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,221
Coffee.

15
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,556
Ah!

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,600
{\an8}We need some excitement
around here.

17
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,274
{\an8}Chinese checkers
or domestic, sir?

18
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,312
{\an8}No, no, something fun--

19
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,146
{\an8}Something the men will enjoy,
like a safety drill.

20
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,652
{\an8}But what kind?

21
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,154
Eh, meltdown alert?
Mad dog drill?

22
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,606
Blimp attack?

23
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:15,276
Ah, I think a good old-fashioned
fire drill today.

24
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,486
(alarm blares)

25
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,414
{\an8}All right,
popcorn's ready.

{\an8}(alarm continues)

27
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:25,087
{\an8}Hey,
that's the fire alarm.

28
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,088
{\an8}We got to get
out of here.

29
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,800
{\an8}Wait for me.

30
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,420
{\an8}Come on, come on,
come on!

31
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,757
Look out!

32
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,636
{\an8}Get out of my way!

{\an8}(fretting)

34
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:41,813
{\an8}Huh.

35
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,233
{\an8}Mmm.

36
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,651
{\an8}Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
Fire! Fire!

37
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,780
{\an8}Is it supposed
to take this long?

38
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,071
{\an8}What's a good time

39
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,284
{\an8}for a mass evacuation
of the entire plant?

40
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,195
{\an8}45 seconds.

41
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,623
And what's our time so far?

42
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,081
I don't know, sir.

43
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,911
This stopwatch only
goes up to 15 minutes.

44
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,576
Damnation.

45
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,375
What kind of slow coaches
do I have working for me?

46
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,668
Ah, here comes
one of our fellows now.

47
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,875
I think I won,
Mr. Burns.

48
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,097
Yes, you won,
all right.

49
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,888
You won more
than you bargained for.

50
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:20,893
Whoo-hoo!

51
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,024
What a disgraceful display.

52
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,311
I've seen more orderly behavior
in a Ritz brothers film.

53
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,566
You all need
a serious lesson in teamwork.

54
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,568
Maybe he does,
but I don't.

55
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,110
Hey,
you take that back.

56
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,743
No, you take
that back.

57
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,740
Yeah! Yeah!

58
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,202
Hit him, Carl!
You, too, Lenny!

59
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,243
(groans)

60
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,156
So Burns is going
to make us all

61
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,115
go on a stupid
corporate retreat

62
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,495
up in the mountains
to learn about teamwork,

63
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,463
which means we'll have
to cancel our plans

64
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,543
to hang around here.

65
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,167
-Teamwork is overrated.
-Huh?

66
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:56,125
Think about it. I mean,
what team was Babe Ruth on?

67
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,087
-Who knows?
-ALL: Yankees.

68
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,048
Sharing is a
bunch of bull, too.

69
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,058
And helping others.

70
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,429
And what's all this crap

71
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,925
I've been hearing
about tolerance?

72
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,187
Hmm. Your ideas
are intriguing to me,

73
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,559
and I wish to subscribe
to your newsletter.

74
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,646
But I think we have to go
on the retreat anyway.

75
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,177
Well, here we are.

76
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,841
All right,
let me start off

77
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,598
by telling you this will not
be a walk in the park.

78
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,020
This will be
the most arduous

79
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,928
and backbreaking
weekend of your life.

80
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:49,307
I cannot overemphasize
the dangers which...

81
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,435
Did you bring your family,
Simpson?

82
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:54,362
Yes, sir.
I thought I was supposed to.

83
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,242
Ah, imbecile.

84
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,779
Simpson, your family
will have to remain here.

85
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,163
-Aw, man.
-Aw...

86
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,870
Don't worry, kids.
This is a national park.

87
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,660
We can have lots of fun.

88
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,293
Oh, I'm afraid that's
no longer true, ma'am.

89
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,371
Budget cutbacks
have forced us

90
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,576
to eliminate anything
the least bit entertaining.

91
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,665
Well, uh, see you.

92
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,429
Each two-man team will work
its way through the wilderness

93
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,351
to a cabin hidden somewhere
on this mountain.

94
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,390
The routes are treacherous,
so use your maps.

95
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,885
I lost my map.

96
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,097
You haven't been
issued a map yet.

97
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,437
When you arrive
at the cabin,

98
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,192
there will be
a congratulatory party

99
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,034
with sandwiches and
moderately-priced champagne.

100
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,410
(applause)

101
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,988
Now, as an added incentive,

102
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,243
the second to last team
to arrive at the cabin

103
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,445
will receive
an hilarious

104
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,446
"World's Worst
Employee" Trophy.

105
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,248
Hey, this sounds
like fun.

106
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,751
And the last team
to arrive will be fired.

107
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,294
(chuckles)
Uh-oh.

108
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,337
And to show that
I'm not playing favorites,

109
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,761
both Smithers and I
will be participating.

110
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,140
Who knows? I might be
the unlucky one who gets fired.

111
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,588
(to himself)
Not bloody likely.

112
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,468
I've placed all your
names in this hat.

113
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,886
-Ooh!
-Thank you.

114
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,314
Now, pair off
as I draw your names.

115
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,153
Lenny and... Carl.

116
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,479
Aw, nuts.
I mean, um...

117
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,646
Aw, nuts.

118
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,904
Fong and... Zutroy.

119
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,367
Kimball and... Dawson.

120
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,489
Haney and... Drucker.

121
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:31,287
Simpson and... Burns?

122
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,752
(groans)

123
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,752
HOMER'S BRAIN:
<i>Quiet, you fool.</i>

124
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,304
<i>You're on the one team</i>
<i>that can't possibly be fired.</i>

125
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,298
Oh.

126
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,049
Sir, this can't be right.

127
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,511
You assured me
this drawing was rigged

128
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,511
so we'd be teammates.

129
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,342
Yes, well, frankly,

130
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,927
you've been
bit of a pill lately.

131
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,352
Why do we always
fight on vacation?

132
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,312
Now, there's only
one name left.

133
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,522
Whoever it is
will be paired with me.

134
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,193
And that person is...

135
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,481
Waylon Smithers.

136
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,274
Perfect.
That's just perfect.

137
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,528
Prepare for the
adventure of a lifetime

138
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,070
as you fight for survival

139
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,453
against the merciless
forces of nature.

140
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,070
Toe your marks...

141
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,867
Get set...

142
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,330
Go!

143
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,123
Ready, Mr. Burns?

144
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,289
One moment.

145
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,443
<i>Only who can prevent</i>
<i>forest fires?</i>

146
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,110
<i>You pressed "You,"</i>
<i>referring to me.</i>

147
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,940
<i>That is incorrect.</i>
<i>The correct answer is you.</i>

148
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,447
(snarls)

149
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,859
Mom, can Lisa and I
play outside

150
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,277
away from the bear?

151
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,825
Okay, but when you start
getting apple-cheeked,

152
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,369
it's time to come in.

153
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,588
How could you do this
to me, Mr. Burns?

154
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,222
After all
I've done for you.

155
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,968
Why, if you were here,

156
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,220
I'd kick you right
in your bony old behind!

157
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:13,642
<i>(echoing)</i>
<i>Bony old behind!</i>

158
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,064
Why, thank you, Simpson.

159
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,103
I have been
watching my figure.

160
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,976
(cackles)

161
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,483
Lise, Lise, come here.

162
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,815
I found two snowflakes
that are exactly alike.

163
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,780
LISA: Really?
Let me see.

164
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,821
(evil chuckle)

165
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,369
SMITHERS: Ow!

166
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,118
Oops. Sorry.

167
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,491
Hi, Mr. Smithers.

168
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,408
Oh, great.
It's the Bobbsey twins.

169
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,287
Well, take your
prying eyes elsewhere.

170
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,384
Oh, I'm sorry.

171
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,130
It hasn't been
a good day.

172
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,211
If I don't get to the top
of the mountain real soon,

173
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,377
-I could get fired.
-We'll help you.

174
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,836
I have a watch
with a minute hand.

175
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,335
All right,
you can come.

176
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,348
What time is it?

177
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,009
12:80.

178
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,427
No, wait.

179
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,475
Wait.
What comes after 12?

180
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,519
One.

181
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,602
No, after 12.

182
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,686
Ohh...

183
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,150
Tell me, Simpson,

184
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,941
if an opportunity arose
for taking a small shortcut,

185
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,487
you wouldn't be averse
to taking it, would you?

186
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,281
Um, not as such.

187
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,034
Neither would I.

188
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,736
I've always felt that
there's far too much

189
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,446
hysteria these days
about so-called cheating.

190
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,367
-Yes, a lot of hysteria.
-Mm-hmm.

191
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,917
If you can take advantage
of a situation in some way,

192
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,501
it's your duty
as an American to do it.

193
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,506
Why should the race
always be to the swift

194
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,468
or the jumble
to the quick-witted?

195
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,548
Should they win merely because
of the gifts God gave them?

196
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:34,255
Well, I say cheating is
the gift man gives himself.

197
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,517
Mr. Burns, I insist
that we cheat.

198
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,929
Excellent.

199
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,767
And to do so,
I propose we travel by...

200
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,524
horseless sleigh.

201
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,646
Wow. You sure know
how to cheat, Mr. Burns.

202
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,654
Yes, well,
I'm older than you.

203
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,606
You know, Simpson
you're not as objectionable

204
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,777
as you seemed
when we first met.

205
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,485
No, sir, I am not.

206
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,833
(motor revving)

207
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,592
Bart?

208
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,379
Lisa?

209
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,376
Hello?

210
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,426
(projector whirrs)

211
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,640
NARRATOR: <i>The story of our</i>
<i>national parks begins in 1872.</i>

212
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,732
<i>Perhaps we should let John Muir</i>
<i>tell the tale.</i>

213
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,139
MUIR:
<i>Oh, yeah. I remember...</i>

214
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:26,318
<i>(incoherent mumbling)</i>

215
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,244
Excuse me, sir.

216
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,742
I can't find my children.

217
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,204
Have you checked the woods?

218
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,004
-No.
-Hmm.

219
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,328
Follow me.

220
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,503
We'll take
the chair lift.

221
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,001
It'll give us
an eagle-eye view

222
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,172
of the area directly
beneath the chair lift.

223
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,633
Whoo!

224
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,173
Well, I won't lie
to you, ma'am.

225
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,416
Our chances of finding
your children

226
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,467
are slim to nil.

227
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,390
LISA:
Hi, Mom.

228
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,928
MARGE:
There they are!

229
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,762
Let me down here.

230
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,677
Sorry. There's no way off
till we get to the top.

231
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,305
And even then,
it's sort of tricky.

232
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,142
(grumbles)

233
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,477
All right, kids,
we'll meet you at the top!

234
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,273
Just be careful!

235
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,476
Uh, actually, I'm a little
more concerned about us.

236
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,987
(creaking)

237
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,148
Um, do you know
how to weld?

238
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:20,577
That worked so well.

239
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,291
We have several hours
before the others arrive.

240
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,501
What say we get comfy?

241
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,422
Now we have electricity.

242
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,420
This propane tank
will supply us with heat.

243
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,087
And this doorknob,
properly turned,

244
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,303
will allow us
access to the cabin.

245
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,218
No going through
the window for us.

246
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,434
BART: Is there maple syrup
in this one?

247
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,684
SMITHERS: There isn't any food
in any of these trees.

248
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,267
Please, Bart,
we've got to hurry.

249
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,022
I can't be the last one
to reach the cabin.

250
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,233
Hey, I'm not going
to get fired.

251
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,694
Is there any gold
in this mountain?

252
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,074
(sputtering)
It doesn't matter.

253
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,571
I'll check.

254
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,074
Mr. Smithers!
Mr. Smithers!

255
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,616
I found another
hurt shrew.

256
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,369
I think this one
has a twisted ankle.

257
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,912
Twisted ank...

258
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,205
Aren't there any
healthy animals in this forest?

259
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,459
Well, I don't suppose
the others will mind us

260
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,841
starting the party early,
Homie, old boy.

261
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,379
More champagne?

262
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,632
(chuckles)

263
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,093
You know, Mr. Burns,

264
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,223
you're the richest guy
I know.

265
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,840
Way richer than Lenny.

266
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:22,007
Oh, yes, but I'd trade it
all for a little more.

267
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,228
Oh, these sure are
comfortable chairs.

268
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,888
Oh, yes, sitting.
The great leveler.

269
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,857
From the mightiest pharaoh
to the lowliest peasant,

270
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,149
who doesn't
enjoy a good sit?

271
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,283
Oh, man,
you are so right.

272
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,901
Did you ever
sit like this?

273
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,657
Yes, yes,
that's it.

274
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,329
Oh, I could go
for one of those right now.

275
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,499
Ahh!

276
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:48,538
The only hard part
is getting up.

277
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,544
(chuckles)

278
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,285
Why get up?

279
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,797
Here's a little move
I've been tinkering with.

280
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,839
Say I want
that bowl of dip.

281
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,933
Why, you'd
have to get up.

282
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,218
Oh?

283
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,851
(grunting)

284
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,644
Sir, I am in your debt.

285
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,728
Use it wisely,
my friend.

286
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,573
(tinkling)

287
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,649
(rumbling)

288
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,855
Ah! Oh!

289
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,865
Hey, did you
hear something?

290
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,701
-No.
-Hmm. Did I?

291
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:26,656
I don't know.

292
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,922
Hope that wasn't
an avalanche.

293
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,459
Be a chum
and take a look-see.

294
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,882
You got it, buddy.

295
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,763
Oh!

296
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,771
Isn't there any way
out of here?

297
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,941
I don't see one.
Unless...

298
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,856
No, there's no way out.

299
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,362
There must be
some way

300
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,284
to contact
the outside world.

301
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,952
Ah, the telegraph.

302
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:09,286
S.O.S.

303
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,251
Avalanche...

304
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,922
Send...

305
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,670
Help.

306
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,882
(beeping)

307
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,631
(beeping)

308
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,478
According to the map,
the cabin should be right here.

309
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,232
(grunting)

310
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,904
Hey, maybe
there is no cabin.

311
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,743
Maybe it's one of them
metaphorical things.

312
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,360
Oh, yeah, yeah...
like maybe the cabin

313
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,737
is the place
inside each of us

314
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,945
created by our goodwill
and teamwork.

315
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,365
Oh.

316
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,960
Uh, they said
there would be sandwiches.

317
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,010
Simpson,
I have a confession.

318
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,764
I'm not quite
the tunnel-digger

319
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,056
I made myself out to be.

320
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,468
You can supervise me.

321
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,267
All right, good.
Let's dig.

322
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,060
That's right.
Dig some more.

323
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:16,063
Oh, we make quite a duo--
Burns and associate.

324
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,646
No, no,
what am I thinking?

325
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,361
Burns and teammate.

326
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,816
(both gasping)

327
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,252
We made it,
old friend.

328
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,828
We sure did.

329
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,043
-Huzzah!
-Whoo-hoo!

330
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,884
(rumbling)

331
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,419
(screaming)

332
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,672
D'oh!

333
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,469
What happened?

334
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,517
(rumbling)

335
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,691
I think when we yelled

336
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,478
we caused
another avalanche.

337
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:03,244
(quietly and slowly)
We... should... be... careful

338
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,739
not... to... speak...

339
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:11,871
unless... it's...
absolutely...

340
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,372
pos-i-tively...

341
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,996
necessary.

342
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,252
(rumbling)

343
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,375
Shh.

344
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,884
You're... causing

345
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,344
more... avalanches.

346
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,385
(rumbling)

347
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,099
-I...
-(rumbling)

348
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,889
-Think...
-(rumbling)

349
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:35,102
-They've... stopped.
-(rumbling)

350
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,147
Let's go.

351
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,450
(door creaks)

352
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,204
Oh!

353
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,954
Those last three avalanches
were your fault, Simpson.

354
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,287
So what?

355
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,672
Sew buttons.

356
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,589
There's not another
place for miles.

357
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,511
This must be the cabin
Burns was talking about.

358
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,888
Well, we made it
here first.

359
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,549
All thanks
to teamwork.

360
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,967
Yeah, my teamwork.

361
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,225
We must be covered
by a thousand feet of snow.

362
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,268
It could be days
before they find us.

363
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:22,692
Mmm, no books, no radio
no board games.

364
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,733
Ah!
A "Bazooka Joe" Comic!

365
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,857
Ugh, I heard that one
75 years ago!

366
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,485
We could build
snowmen.

367
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,572
No, I have
a better idea.

368
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,738
We could build real men
out of snow.

369
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,708
Oh.

370
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,118
Okay...

371
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,416
(shivering)

372
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,763
Ah!

373
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,050
Mr. Smithers, Mr. Smithers!
That moose is on fire!

374
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,095
Fine. Good.
I don't care anymore.

375
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,678
I'm the last one here.
You kids cost me my job.

376
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,734
You ain't last,
Mr. Smithers.

377
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,598
Ah, thank goodness.

378
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,595
Yeah, Burnsie and Homer
never made it.

379
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,557
Mr. Burns is still
out there?

380
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,897
(gasps)
What about our dad?!

381
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,783
Ah, 206 bones,

382
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,991
50 miles of
small intestine,

383
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,951
full pouting lips.

384
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,032
Why, this fellow
is less a snowman

385
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,197
than a god.

386
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,621
Well, we've managed
to stave off

387
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,575
cabin fever
for a few hours.

388
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,746
Eh, I think we should
dress the snowmen.

389
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:27,957
Agreed.

390
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,797
Look at them.

391
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,595
Smug and secure
in their finery.

392
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,969
Mocking us.

393
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,016
Uh, they're just
snowmen, Mr. Burns.

394
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,309
Ah, snowmen
have peepers.

395
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,943
Peepers to watch...

396
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,610
To watch for a moment
of weakness and, baff!

397
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,608
Comes the knock on the head
and we're down!

398
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,780
What do we do?!

399
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,318
Oh, wouldn't you
like to know.

400
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,490
Hey, what is going on here?
Who are you people?

401
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,366
This is a lookout post.
Where is ranger McFadden?

402
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,584
(slurred)
I was just happy

403
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,714
to see so many
nice people.

404
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,092
Quiet, you drunk.
Where is ranger McFadden?

405
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,919
Right here, sir.
Right behind the drunk.

406
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,424
Wait a minute.

407
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,216
If this is
a ranger station

408
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,679
we must be
in the wrong place.

409
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,349
Well, the only other
cabin is right over...

410
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,508
There...

411
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,517
Huh.

412
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,888
(whistles)

413
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,434
Look at all
these avalanches.

414
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,018
Do you think they could
have buried the cabin?

415
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,653
I'll tell you
one thing:

416
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,269
They didn't come here for
the mountain music festival.

417
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,897
March 14th to 18th.

418
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,693
Mom, Dad and Mr. Burns
could be trapped in there.

419
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,648
(gasps)

420
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,664
<i>BURNS:</i>
<i>I'm trapped with a madman.</i>

421
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,794
<i>Look at him.</i>
<i>Staring into me.</i>

422
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,296
<i>Filling my mind</i>
<i>with paranoid thoughts.</i>

423
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,509
<i>HOMER:</i>
<i>Mmm. Look at his eyes.</i>

424
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,549
<i>He's trying to hypnotize me</i>

425
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,933
<i>but not in the good</i>
<i>Las Vegas way.</i>

426
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,300
BURNS: <i>(gasps)</i>
<i>I know what he's up to.</i>

427
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,927
<i>He's thinking of killing me</i>

428
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,854
<i>then riding my carcass</i>
<i>down the mountain to safety.</i>

429
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:07,484
<i>He's truly gone mad</i>
<i>if he's thinking that.</i>

430
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,823
<i>Well, he can't kill me</i>
<i>if I kill him first.</i>

431
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:11,899
I'll kill you

432
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,494
you bloated museum
of treachery!

433
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,649
You and what army?

434
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,910
(gasps)

435
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,161
Stay back.

436
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,582
I have powers.

437
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,701
Political powers!

438
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,002
(gasps)

439
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,503
It's... showtime!

440
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,884
(grunting)

441
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,137
Gimme!
Let go of that!

442
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,439
Oh, God...

443
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,559
(grunts)

444
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,146
Ah!

445
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,441
(rumbling)

446
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,824
Homer!

447
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,071
Burnsie!

448
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,701
(both screaming)

449
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,581
Okay, search party,
before we set out

450
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,328
let's take a moment
to humor the children.

451
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,961
Kids, your father is
going to be just fine.

452
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,415
Okay, everybody
put on your

453
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,669
corpse-handling gloves.

454
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,961
We've got two
frozen bodies

455
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,554
buried somewhere
in this mountain.

456
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,799
Did you hear that, Lise?

457
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,260
Dad's going
to be just fine.

458
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,381
(rumbling)

459
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,717
Look! What's that?!

460
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,058
We'll be dashed to pieces!

461
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,601
Oh, Lord, protect
this rockethouse

462
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,774
and all who dwell
within the rockethouse.

463
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,063
It's them, all right.

464
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,936
We're over here, Homie!

465
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,943
Oh, something's wrong
with its brakes!

466
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,525
Gangway!

467
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,584
(door creaks)

468
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,789
Marge, kids.

469
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,785
(all clamoring)

470
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,585
(Burns clearing throat)

471
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,632
Have you people forgotten
our little competition?

472
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,505
Last one
in the cabin is fired!

473
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,052
(clamoring)

474
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,722
You're fired, Lenny.

475
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:07,927
Aw, nuts!

476
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,814
So, how did we do?

477
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,404
It's a new record, sir.

478
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,769
Outstanding.

479
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,315
Well, perhaps all of this
has been worthwhile.

480
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,820
Did you all learn
about teamwork?

481
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,152
ALL: (weakly) Yes.

482
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,697
Excellent!

483
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,740
In that case

484
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,993
no one will be
fired after all.

485
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,825
That old goat
can't fire me.

486
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,331
I'm going to give him
a piece of my mi...

Well, Simpson,
I must say
