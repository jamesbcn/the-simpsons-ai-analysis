1
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:12,049
Well done, the band.

2
00:00:12,117 --> 00:00:13,784
We're all bursting with pride

3
00:00:13,852 --> 00:00:16,537
after our girls' basketball team
beat Shelbyville

4
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:18,772
two-nothing in triple overtime!

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,608
Now let's make some noise.

6
00:00:20,675 --> 00:00:22,076
Using our...

7
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:23,210
inside voices!

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,950
Please welcome Springfield
Elementary's own Lady Pumas!

9
00:00:36,858 --> 00:00:39,260
I'm sorry, but the team
all got food poisoning

10
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:41,528
at the pre-rally
egg salad sandwich party.

11
00:00:41,596 --> 00:00:43,597
Luckily, as equipment manager,

12
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:45,599
I... was not... invited!

13
00:00:47,202 --> 00:00:48,602
No team? Oh, I guess

14
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,605
I just have to give you all
an hour of free play.

15
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,409
Let chaos reign!

16
00:00:58,563 --> 00:01:00,164
Actually, I do have
a speech prepared.

17
00:01:00,231 --> 00:01:02,366
Excellent, Lisa.
Free play cancelled.

18
00:01:03,868 --> 00:01:05,753
No one cancels
my free play!

19
00:01:07,422 --> 00:01:09,006
Sorry, man.

20
00:01:09,074 --> 00:01:12,126
It's okay. Thanks for making me
part of the revolution.

21
00:01:12,193 --> 00:01:13,694
Edna, control your student!

22
00:01:13,762 --> 00:01:14,928
He's ruined more assemblies

23
00:01:14,996 --> 00:01:16,964
than the afternoon sun
in the west window.

24
00:01:17,032 --> 00:01:18,332
He's uncontrollable!

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,967
Pumpkin stickers mean nothing
to him!

26
00:01:20,035 --> 00:01:21,285
That's crazy talk.

27
00:01:29,778 --> 00:01:30,644
Wee!

28
00:01:30,712 --> 00:01:31,812
Me bleachers

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,280
have been weaponized!

30
00:01:33,348 --> 00:01:35,282
Abandon gym!

31
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:55,602
Huh?

32
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,805
You unrepentant
little twerp!

33
00:02:03,345 --> 00:02:05,045
Oh, Edna.

34
00:02:05,113 --> 00:02:07,214
It was an open hand.
Does that help?

35
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:08,649
Edna,

36
00:02:08,717 --> 00:02:10,734
we can tolerate mild alcoholism,

37
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:12,419
leaving melted cheese
in the microwave,

38
00:02:12,487 --> 00:02:14,421
even selling A's
for cigarettes.

39
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:16,457
But in laying a
hand on a student,

40
00:02:16,524 --> 00:02:18,258
you have crossed a line.

41
00:02:18,326 --> 00:02:19,760
Nurse, get
a slap kit.

42
00:02:19,828 --> 00:02:21,161
Right away, sir.

43
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:23,263
In all my years of teaching,

44
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:25,899
I've never raised a hand
to a student.

45
00:02:25,967 --> 00:02:28,235
But you learned!
You grew!

46
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:31,705
No! You should never raise
your hand to a child.

47
00:02:31,773 --> 00:02:33,874
Just leave the crust
on their sandwiches.

48
00:02:33,942 --> 00:02:35,476
They'll get
the message.

49
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:37,111
Rest assured,
Mrs. Simpson,

50
00:02:37,178 --> 00:02:40,481
that we have a zero-tolerance
policy for this sort of thing

51
00:02:40,548 --> 00:02:42,616
when it occurs in
front of witnesses.

52
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:44,418
What's going to happen to me?

53
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:47,271
Edna, you're suspended
with full pay until the hearing,

54
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:50,758
which is currently scheduled
for 57 years from tomorrow.

55
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:54,094
It was going to be 60,
but I moved it up because I...

56
00:02:54,162 --> 00:02:55,779
I like the way
you torment Skinner.

57
00:02:55,847 --> 00:03:00,384
Oh. So I-I still get my check,
but I get to stay at home?

58
00:03:00,452 --> 00:03:02,352
I'm afraid
it's not quite that simple.

59
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,254
Uh, Seymour, who's
running this meeting?

60
00:03:04,322 --> 00:03:05,923
I thought I was.

61
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,776
Edna, until the state
disciplinary committee rules

62
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:11,245
on your case,
every workday you'll report

63
00:03:11,312 --> 00:03:13,914
to a school board
holding facility--

64
00:03:13,982 --> 00:03:16,200
an educational limbo,
as it were,

65
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:19,002
where you are
the unbaptized dead by.

66
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:22,539
They never seem
to like that analogy.

67
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:26,510
This is the Rubber Room,

68
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:28,195
where accused
teachers are held

69
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:30,881
until the school board
decides what to do with them.

70
00:03:30,965 --> 00:03:33,901
You show up here every day,
7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.

71
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:36,937
Shoes remain on, cell
phones remain off.

72
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:39,440
No Wi-Fi, and you may not
refer to this experience

73
00:03:39,507 --> 00:03:41,608
as either Kafkaesque
or Orwellian.

74
00:03:41,676 --> 00:03:43,510
I have to come here
every day?!

75
00:03:43,578 --> 00:03:45,312
Or you could quit.

76
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,514
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

77
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:49,817
The only thing I'd like more is
if I could quit.

78
00:03:49,884 --> 00:03:51,618
Well, I'm not quitting.

79
00:03:51,686 --> 00:03:54,254
I'm staying here
till you give me my job back.

80
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:56,356
So, what do you
do for fun here?

81
00:03:56,424 --> 00:03:58,225
You'll find ways
to pass the time.

82
00:03:58,293 --> 00:04:01,094
Me, I watch that crack
in the ceiling.

83
00:04:01,162 --> 00:04:04,431
Hey, hey, find
your own crack!

84
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:05,833
Now before I leave,

85
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,318
let me turn on this
malfunctioning air conditioner.

86
00:04:09,387 --> 00:04:11,338
Is that ice?

87
00:04:11,406 --> 00:04:13,140
Uh, no, no,
they're spider eggs.

88
00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:16,860
He's a science teacher.

89
00:04:16,928 --> 00:04:18,812
He'll know what to do.

90
00:04:26,237 --> 00:04:27,771
Psst! Mrs. K!

91
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,106
Down here!

92
00:04:29,174 --> 00:04:31,909
Haven't you caused
enough trouble?

93
00:04:31,976 --> 00:04:34,378
You shouldn't suffer
for my bad deed.

94
00:04:34,445 --> 00:04:36,246
It should just go
unpunished forever.

95
00:04:36,314 --> 00:04:38,515
Fine, half-assed
apology accepted.

96
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,250
Now, if you'll excuse me,

97
00:04:40,318 --> 00:04:42,986
I have a lot
of very important things to do.

98
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:49,142
Pah!

99
00:04:52,146 --> 00:04:53,514
What else do you want
to talk about?

100
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:54,581
Meet me in the bathroom.

101
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,721
Check this out--
a dead possum.

102
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:02,973
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

103
00:05:05,894 --> 00:05:07,861
Okay, Bart,
what's going on?

104
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:10,330
I'm a teacher in a
bathroom with a student.

105
00:05:10,398 --> 00:05:12,566
That's why most of these people
are here in the first place.

106
00:05:12,634 --> 00:05:14,768
Mrs. K., I'm here to spring you.

107
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:16,336
Well, that's kind of you,

108
00:05:16,404 --> 00:05:18,906
especially after I nearly
choked the life out of you.

109
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:20,274
You didn't do that.

110
00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:22,442
No, but that's what
I told everyone I did

111
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,514
to earn the respect
of the gangs.

112
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:30,417
But I can't just wander out of
here whenever I feel like it.

113
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:31,985
Who says you're leaving?

114
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:35,489
You made a dummy of me?

115
00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:37,257
Mm, I use it to
workshop my pranks.

116
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:44,631
Now follow me!

117
00:05:48,536 --> 00:05:50,704
Oh, I don't know about this.

118
00:05:50,772 --> 00:05:52,139
I can't believe

119
00:05:52,206 --> 00:05:54,174
a middle-aged woman is scared
of a three-story drop.

120
00:05:54,242 --> 00:05:57,010
I'll show you who's middle-aged!

121
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,267
Hmm?

122
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:04,568
Oh, great!

123
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:06,937
The one day
I put cream cheese on my bagel!

124
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:17,497
Did a volcano
erupt in Candyland?

125
00:06:17,565 --> 00:06:19,933
'Cause I just caught
me a flying red hot!

126
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:21,768
Ha! Ah...

127
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:26,636
You know, I don't believe

128
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:29,204
we've ever been formally
introduced. Anyhoo,

129
00:06:29,303 --> 00:06:31,337
so I don't commit the
deadliest of sins--

130
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:32,906
omission--
here's my card.

131
00:06:32,973 --> 00:06:34,374
Oh.

132
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:36,242
Edna Krabappel.

133
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:38,394
Good luck finding
a rhythm for that

134
00:06:38,462 --> 00:06:40,864
Okay, Ms. Krabappel,
what made you topple?

135
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:43,666
Oh, your card doesn't lie.

136
00:06:43,734 --> 00:06:45,435
Well, I'm a truthful
kind of guy.

137
00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:48,171
And I like
how it's printed in orange.

138
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:50,306
Hmm.

139
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:52,909
Uh, so, uh, we were talking
about why you decided

140
00:06:52,977 --> 00:06:54,811
to drop in
to the Flanders Arms.

141
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,115
For some reason, I was following
the advice of one Bart Simpson.

142
00:06:59,183 --> 00:07:01,417
Bart Simpson? Why, he lives
right next door to me!

143
00:07:01,485 --> 00:07:02,719
Yeah, when they made him,

144
00:07:02,786 --> 00:07:04,687
they did not skimp on
the puppy dog tails.

145
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:06,189
And what about that father?

146
00:07:06,257 --> 00:07:07,423
Homer?

147
00:07:09,426 --> 00:07:11,227
Yeah, he's the peanut
in your popcorn.

148
00:07:11,295 --> 00:07:14,230
Lots of fun... I guess.

149
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:16,699
So, what say
we have lunch?

150
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,585
You know, I wouldn't mind

151
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:20,053
Homer lying naked
in his hammock,

152
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,989
but does he have to string it up
higher than the fence line?

153
00:07:23,057 --> 00:07:24,424
I'll bet your wife
doesn't like it.

154
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:25,658
Ah, I'm afraid

155
00:07:25,726 --> 00:07:27,627
my Maudie's putting plastic
on the clouds now.

156
00:07:27,695 --> 00:07:30,096
Oh, you poor man.

157
00:07:30,164 --> 00:07:31,664
Besides my kids, the only thing

158
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:33,566
in my life is my business,
The Leftorium.

159
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:34,834
We've been the anchor store

160
00:07:34,902 --> 00:07:36,970
in the sad mall
for the last ten years.

161
00:07:37,037 --> 00:07:37,870
Oh.

162
00:07:37,938 --> 00:07:39,772
And you're a former Mrs.,

163
00:07:39,857 --> 00:07:42,308
so, uh, where's
your husband buried?

164
00:07:42,376 --> 00:07:43,626
Probably between
the hooters

165
00:07:43,694 --> 00:07:45,945
of a coat check girl
in Shelbyville. Ha!

166
00:07:46,013 --> 00:07:48,248
Oh, boy, that laugh
is infectious.

167
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:50,283
Ha! <i>Ha!</i>

168
00:07:50,351 --> 00:07:51,884
That's fun.

169
00:07:51,952 --> 00:07:53,870
Thank you for
lunch, Ned.

170
00:07:53,938 --> 00:07:56,339
Well, thank <i>you</i> for taking me
to that Pinkberry place.

171
00:07:56,373 --> 00:07:57,707
It's a lot less racy

172
00:07:57,775 --> 00:07:59,826
than its name
would lead you to believe.

173
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:01,127
Crossing it off
my do-not-go list.

174
00:08:01,195 --> 00:08:02,795
Mm-hmm.

175
00:08:02,863 --> 00:08:05,632
Well, sir, I guess
I better refenestrate ya.

176
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,904
Any chance
I could see you again?

177
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:15,441
You know, I am a fallen woman.

178
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:17,410
Whoa, slow down.

179
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:20,213
I never go to second
entendre on the first date.

180
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:23,766
Oh, ho.

181
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:28,805
You've been in there
for three hours!

182
00:08:28,872 --> 00:08:31,407
What are you doing,
taking a bath?!

183
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:36,913
♪ I cried
through many endless nights ♪

184
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:40,850
♪ Just holding my pillow tight ♪

185
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:44,103
♪ Then you came
into my lonely days ♪

186
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:47,473
♪ With your tender love
and sweet ways ♪

187
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,443
♪ Now, I don't know where
you come from, baby ♪

188
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:52,662
Aw.

189
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,164
♪ Don't know where
you've been, my baby... ♪

190
00:08:55,232 --> 00:08:57,116
Good news, Edna.

191
00:08:57,184 --> 00:08:58,685
The governor crushed
the teachers' union,

192
00:08:58,752 --> 00:09:00,687
so you don't have to
stay here anymore.

193
00:09:00,754 --> 00:09:02,221
Now I can just fire you.

194
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:03,489
Where will I go?

195
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:05,024
I'll rehire you,

196
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:08,294
but you will have to work
weekends as a prison guard.

197
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:10,096
Well, I would get a chance

198
00:09:10,164 --> 00:09:11,998
to see lots
of my former students.

199
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:13,766
You've got a deal.

200
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:15,101
<i>Mmm!</i>

201
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:18,404
Getting sprung really made me
feel like celebrating.

202
00:09:18,472 --> 00:09:20,973
Let's see what you're hiding
under this sweater.

203
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:24,410
Huh. Well, maybe
I should lose a layer.

204
00:09:29,233 --> 00:09:31,300
Edna, you're a very
beautiful woman,

205
00:09:31,368 --> 00:09:33,636
but I'm a little,
uh, you know...

206
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:36,439
uncomfortable with
premarital sex.

207
00:09:36,507 --> 00:09:38,207
Oh, come on, Ned.

208
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:39,842
We've both been
married before.

209
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,378
Those two boys of yours
weren't delivered by stork.

210
00:09:42,446 --> 00:09:43,913
Oh, yes, they were.

211
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:45,681
We deliberately
chose a Dr. Stork

212
00:09:45,749 --> 00:09:47,617
so we could say
it without lying.

213
00:09:47,684 --> 00:09:50,219
But I think if we
hold off for a while,

214
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:52,188
you'll find I'm
well worth the wait.

215
00:09:52,256 --> 00:09:55,625
Like a mild cheddar, I get tangy
when I'm sitting on the shelf.

216
00:09:55,692 --> 00:09:58,561
Okay, I'll try it your way.

217
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:01,531
But can I at least nibble
on the cheese? Mmm.

218
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:06,235
Well, a little nibble
won't hurt your appetite.

219
00:10:17,398 --> 00:10:19,465
You have the energy
for one more?

220
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:21,267
Absolutely.

221
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:25,104
This is the best DVD about
cheese-making I've ever seen.

222
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:26,005
Oh, great.

223
00:10:27,908 --> 00:10:29,809
<i>Episode 17: Muenster.</i>

224
00:10:29,877 --> 00:10:31,094
Oh, what the heck?

225
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:33,196
I know it's impolite
to make a move

226
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:35,631
till episode 25 of a
Ken Burns documentary,

227
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:38,768
but you're
that special.

228
00:10:38,836 --> 00:10:40,369
Ned!

229
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:42,305
That's right, I'm down
to my wife-blesser.

230
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:55,677
It's pinot grigio time!

231
00:10:58,648 --> 00:11:00,248
See you tomorrow, Teach.

232
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:01,549
Don't remind me.

233
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:15,880
Mrs. K.?

234
00:11:15,948 --> 00:11:17,899
Are you still bumping
moustaches with Ned?

235
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:20,168
Yes. And the way
things are going,

236
00:11:20,236 --> 00:11:21,783
you're going to be
seeing me here a lot.

237
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:23,208
Even on snow days?

238
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:27,876
Snow days, strike days, half-day
afternoons, and all summer long.

239
00:11:27,944 --> 00:11:30,345
By the way-- you forgot to bring
home your math worksheet.

240
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:32,314
It's due tomorrow-- no excuses.

241
00:11:32,381 --> 00:11:33,848
But what if my dog eats it?

242
00:11:35,484 --> 00:11:37,752
That's the dog that's always
eating your homework?

243
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,854
Yeah. Um, he hates how learning

244
00:11:39,922 --> 00:11:42,707
has taken me to a place
he'll never go. See?

245
00:11:47,546 --> 00:11:49,314
Hang on.
Wait a minute.

246
00:12:05,464 --> 00:12:08,049
Little help?

247
00:12:08,117 --> 00:12:09,351
Little help?
Little help?

248
00:12:09,418 --> 00:12:10,585
Uh, little
help?

249
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:11,987
Flanders,
little help?

250
00:12:12,054 --> 00:12:15,874
Homer, could you stop throwin'
balls over my fence?

251
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:17,308
Oh, absolutely,
Ned. Sorry.

252
00:12:18,511 --> 00:12:20,862
Little help?

253
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,904
Don't worry, sweetie.

254
00:12:29,972 --> 00:12:32,624
Daddy will put Jack
back in the box.

255
00:12:32,692 --> 00:12:35,260
Okay, time to go
back in the...

256
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:36,795
night-night...

257
00:12:36,862 --> 00:12:38,963
This is harder
than it looks.

258
00:12:39,031 --> 00:12:42,133
Don't you humiliate me
in front of my kid.

259
00:12:42,201 --> 00:12:43,668
I thought we had
a deal, man.

260
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:52,377
Well, if it isn't
the local school marm

261
00:12:52,445 --> 00:12:54,045
and his new girlfriend.

262
00:12:55,981 --> 00:12:58,516
That's a burn on you, Flanders.

263
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:01,119
Pretty funny, Homer.

264
00:13:01,187 --> 00:13:02,921
It's not funny at all.

265
00:13:02,988 --> 00:13:05,557
Homer, I'd appreciate it if
you weren't so rude to Ned.

266
00:13:05,624 --> 00:13:08,793
Whoa. Flanders, this chick
does not get our thing.

267
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:11,262
Actually,
she sort of does.

268
00:13:12,531 --> 00:13:15,133
Homer, do you know
how lucky you are?

269
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:18,570
Ned is a wonderful, caring man,
and a darn good neighbor.

270
00:13:18,637 --> 00:13:19,637
Language.

271
00:13:19,705 --> 00:13:20,839
Yeah, language.

272
00:13:20,906 --> 00:13:22,640
Sorry, Ned, but
I can't watch this guy

273
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,109
push you around anymore.

274
00:13:25,745 --> 00:13:28,179
Marge, tell her how
I don't push Ned around.

275
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:31,082
Actually, sometimes
you do push Ned around.

276
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,817
What?!

277
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:36,121
Don't do that, Homie.
It rubs off your side hair.

278
00:13:36,188 --> 00:13:38,523
Hey Ned, can I
borrow some hair?

279
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:41,092
Which brings me to item
number two on the agenda:

280
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,561
I understand you borrowed
a thing or two from Ned

281
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:45,513
that you never returned.

282
00:13:47,817 --> 00:13:50,785
And I'll just take
my tumbleweed back.

283
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:53,371
See, Dad?

284
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:55,940
Having Krabappel next door
is nothing but trouble.

285
00:13:56,008 --> 00:13:58,476
Teachers should not be allowed
to live near their students.

286
00:13:58,544 --> 00:13:59,778
We're natural enemies,

287
00:13:59,845 --> 00:14:02,113
like George Washington
and Abraham Lincoln.

288
00:14:02,181 --> 00:14:04,015
Don't panic, son.

289
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,984
We can bust up Teachy
and Preachy.

290
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:07,719
Here's what we do:
I'll take Flanders out

291
00:14:07,787 --> 00:14:09,854
and remind him of the joys
of the single life.

292
00:14:09,922 --> 00:14:12,023
You scare Rod and Todd
by telling them

293
00:14:12,091 --> 00:14:14,859
Krabappel will become
their evil stepmother.

294
00:14:14,927 --> 00:14:17,195
If fairy tales have
taught us one thing,

295
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:18,696
it's that first wives
are perfect,

296
00:14:18,764 --> 00:14:20,365
second wives are horrible.

297
00:14:20,432 --> 00:14:22,767
Just the opposite
of real life.

298
00:14:24,336 --> 00:14:25,703
Yeah, isn't this place great?

299
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:28,273
If you're single, you can
come here every night.

300
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,774
I don't want to come here.

301
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:31,609
Last time I did, someone
slipped me a Mickey

302
00:14:31,677 --> 00:14:33,228
and wrote "Churchy Joe"
on my face.

303
00:14:34,864 --> 00:14:37,132
It's your own fault.
You gotta read the coaster.

304
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:41,669
Oh, my.

305
00:14:41,737 --> 00:14:43,638
Ned, let's cut to the chase.

306
00:14:43,706 --> 00:14:44,906
Yeah, let me guess.

307
00:14:44,974 --> 00:14:46,441
You're probably gonna do
something boneheaded

308
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:48,243
like try to talk me
out of seeing Edna.

309
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,978
Ned, if it's
boneheaded to talk

310
00:14:50,045 --> 00:14:53,815
you out of seeing Edna, then
I don't wanna be brainheaded.

311
00:14:53,883 --> 00:14:55,583
Homer, listen to me.

312
00:14:55,651 --> 00:14:57,836
For a long time now I've been
lookin' over the fence

313
00:14:57,903 --> 00:15:00,405
at that wonderful relationship
you have with Marge.

314
00:15:00,472 --> 00:15:03,708
Then I remember what it was like
to have a sweet woman of my own

315
00:15:03,776 --> 00:15:05,109
lying in a twin bed

316
00:15:05,177 --> 00:15:06,678
across the hall
from mine.

317
00:15:06,745 --> 00:15:09,681
Someone to hold the other end
of the sheet when I fold it up.

318
00:15:09,748 --> 00:15:11,149
Someone to put in my prayers.

319
00:15:11,217 --> 00:15:13,718
Oh, Ned, I never dreamed

320
00:15:13,786 --> 00:15:17,822
that beneath those iddilies and
diddilies there was a dude.

321
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,291
That's right.
And like any man, I put on

322
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:23,561
my secret Christian underpants
one leg at a time.

323
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:29,634
Oh, you beautiful,
beautiful wuss.

324
00:15:29,702 --> 00:15:33,338
And Cinderella's stepmom
made her sew clothes

325
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:35,240
and mop the floor.

326
00:15:35,307 --> 00:15:37,408
We do that already.

327
00:15:37,476 --> 00:15:39,010
Wanna see me
load a bobbin?

328
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:40,545
No, I...
Give me that shirt.

329
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:42,780
I'll patch the hole
in the armpit.

330
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:47,869
Haw haw.

331
00:15:47,937 --> 00:15:49,554
Can I get this
by Tuesday?

332
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:52,807
Ned, I have a
confession to make:

333
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,275
I may not have come here

334
00:15:54,343 --> 00:15:56,344
solely with the noble
intention of getting drunk.

335
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:58,713
But now, from the
bottom of my heart,

336
00:15:58,781 --> 00:16:00,548
I wish you
and Edna the best.

337
00:16:00,616 --> 00:16:01,799
Fellow barflies.

338
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:04,369
To Ned Flanders and
Edna Krabappel.

339
00:16:04,436 --> 00:16:05,370
What a fox.

340
00:16:05,437 --> 00:16:06,604
Yeah, to Edna.

341
00:16:06,672 --> 00:16:07,739
Yeah, that broad
is some dame.

342
00:16:07,806 --> 00:16:09,307
You all know Edna?

343
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,642
Oh, yeah, man.

344
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:13,211
Everybody knows Edna.

345
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,013
We made sweet music
in the band room,

346
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,448
poetry during English class,
and you don't want to know

347
00:16:17,516 --> 00:16:19,417
what we did in
the multi-purpose room.

348
00:16:19,485 --> 00:16:21,085
Shut up.

349
00:16:21,153 --> 00:16:23,888
My e-mail address is
Edna-lover-one-seventy-two.

350
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:25,857
It was the lowest number
I could get.

351
00:16:25,925 --> 00:16:28,893
Guys, quit telling the truth.

352
00:16:28,961 --> 00:16:31,079
Yeah, Edna's amazing.

353
00:16:31,146 --> 00:16:32,213
Joey Kramer?

354
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:33,681
The drummer from Aerosmith?

355
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:35,283
Yup, that's me.

356
00:16:35,351 --> 00:16:37,018
And after a night with Edna,

357
00:16:37,086 --> 00:16:39,988
I couldn't walk this way,
that way, or any other way.

358
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:41,222
Ooh la la.

359
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:44,993
Wait, you've all plucked
a peach from her tree?

360
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,128
Uh... Uh...

361
00:16:47,196 --> 00:16:50,882
So Joey, is Wikipedia accurate
when it says "Walk This Way"

362
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,850
was inspired by
<i>Young Frankenstein?</i>

363
00:16:52,918 --> 00:16:55,219
Well Homer, you really
put one over

364
00:16:55,287 --> 00:16:57,655
on old stupid Flanders, here.

365
00:16:57,723 --> 00:16:58,890
Thanks a lot, neighbor.

366
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,892
Don't you mean "neighboreeno"?

367
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,760
No. Just plain neighbor.

368
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,768
You stupid jerks.

369
00:17:10,836 --> 00:17:13,004
I can't believe
you could be so cruel.

370
00:17:13,072 --> 00:17:16,257
Especially you, Joey Kramer.

371
00:17:18,494 --> 00:17:20,795
Ned, is anything wrong?

372
00:17:20,863 --> 00:17:22,897
You've been acting
distracted all night.

373
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:25,400
Oh, I was just wondering
how many boxes of staples

374
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:27,168
I should order for the store.

375
00:17:27,236 --> 00:17:28,903
Does ten sound like
a lot to you?

376
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:30,538
20? 50?

377
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:32,273
What does sound
like a lot to you?

378
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:37,211
What exactly are we
talking about here?

379
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,780
Oh, okay.

380
00:17:38,814 --> 00:17:39,881
See you tomorrow?

381
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,085
Yeah, give me a
kiss, Neddy boy.

382
00:17:44,153 --> 00:17:45,853
That's right.
Kiss all the men

383
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:49,657
that have ever made their way
to Edna's adventurous tongue.

384
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:52,427
I should be discreet in my Tweet
but brutal in my blog.

385
00:17:52,494 --> 00:17:54,896
We made love
in so many elevators.

386
00:17:56,198 --> 00:17:57,632
Experiment.

387
00:17:58,751 --> 00:17:59,717
What is it?

388
00:17:59,785 --> 00:18:02,153
I can't do it.

389
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:04,188
Edna, call me Delta Airlines

390
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:06,457
'cause I can't handle
your extra baggage.

391
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:08,793
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

392
00:18:08,861 --> 00:18:11,662
No leavin' until we all spook
you on Edna's face.

393
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,699
All right, pipe down back there,
you'll get your chance.

394
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:16,601
Oh come on, Moe, quit
hoggin' her face.

395
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:26,373
I hope you're proud
of yourself, Homer.

396
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,176
I've got some bad
news for you, Marge.

397
00:18:29,243 --> 00:18:31,778
I'm actually not.

398
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:33,747
Well, there's Ned
out on his power walk.

399
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:35,115
Maybe you should talk to him.

400
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:37,184
What?
My doctor said "don't walk."

401
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:39,052
That was a traffic signal.

402
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,353
Hmm.

403
00:18:40,421 --> 00:18:43,490
He's a good man
and a good neighbor,

404
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:45,525
and you're drinking coffee
from his mug right now.

405
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:52,832
Hey, Flanders, hold up.

406
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:54,944
I-I know you're
not comfortable

407
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:57,450
with all the guys Edna's
seen around town.

408
00:18:57,518 --> 00:18:58,885
And country.

409
00:18:58,952 --> 00:19:00,653
Ned, I've...

410
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:03,590
Oh... learned
that the only way

411
00:19:03,657 --> 00:19:07,861
relationship survives
is by forgiving.

412
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:10,498
Endless, endless forgiving.

413
00:19:15,938 --> 00:19:18,506
And didn't the Easter
Bunny himself say

414
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,709
"Forgive them, father,
for finding all my eggs"?

415
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:25,213
And if giant rabbit can
lay chocolate eggs,

416
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:28,116
maybe you and Edna can find
a way to make it work.

417
00:19:37,492 --> 00:19:40,027
Edna, I had a long talk with
Homer Simpson yesterday,

418
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,207
and as I was carrying
him back home,

419
00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:43,532
I had a lot of time to think.

420
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:47,635
You've been with a lot of
men, but I forgive you.

421
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:52,372
You "forgive" me?

422
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,708
You sanctimonious prude.

423
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,144
Who are you to judge
how I've lived my life?

424
00:19:57,212 --> 00:20:01,448
Ned, I'm not ashamed of dating
those men, I'm proud.

425
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:04,584
I still wear
your bra.

426
00:20:04,652 --> 00:20:07,521
Well, not exactly proud,
but I'm stuck.

427
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:09,690
Ned, if we're gonna
stay together,

428
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:11,893
you have to promise that
my past will never,

429
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,562
ever get in our way.

430
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,634
I guess this is gonna have to
be decided by a higher power.

431
00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:21,270
So we're going to let
the Internet decide.

432
00:20:21,338 --> 00:20:23,439
Should Ned and Edna
stay together?

433
00:20:23,507 --> 00:20:26,342
Visit TheSimpsons.com and vote.

434
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:29,244
We'll announce the results in
next year's season premiere.

435
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,680
Probably at the end, so you'll
watch the whole thing.

436
00:20:31,748 --> 00:20:35,350
There's a whole host of voting
options-- friends with benefits,

437
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:38,386
frenemies with frenefits,
super friends with wonder pets,

438
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:39,987
all designed to distract you

439
00:20:40,055 --> 00:20:42,056
while we take your
personal information

440
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:44,925
and use it to apply for
credit cards in your name.

441
00:20:44,992 --> 00:20:47,161
Homer, stop teasing.

442
00:20:47,228 --> 00:20:48,329
Right.

443
00:20:48,396 --> 00:20:49,363
Teasing.

444
00:20:49,431 --> 00:20:50,898
I'm waitin' for ya.

445
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:53,535
Also, if you wanna find the
real shooter of Mr. Burns,

446
00:20:53,603 --> 00:20:55,037
go back and look
for more clues.

447
00:20:55,105 --> 00:20:56,205
They're all there.

448
00:20:56,273 --> 00:20:57,874
Homie, it was Maggie.

449
00:20:57,942 --> 00:20:58,941
Yeah, right.

450
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,344
A baby shot a guy.

451
00:21:01,412 --> 00:21:05,115
Just vote. It's your duty
as a citizen of TV.

452
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,512
Shh!
