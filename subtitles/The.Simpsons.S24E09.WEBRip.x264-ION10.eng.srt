Oh, my God!

178
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,896
This unsourced, undated video

179
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,108
has convinced me beyond any doubt!

180
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,279
And I'm the guy you want to know
when the stuff hits the fan.

181
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,609
Hey, man, no need to almost swear.

182
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,025
Come with me.

183
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,701
Well, Homer's gone.

184
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,992
Let's all go into our suspended state
till he gets back.

185
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,464
Homer, meet the Springfield Preppers.

186
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,215
Preppies? Oh, I hate you guys!

187
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,128
Always partying on deck
with your Docksiders

188
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,718
while us townies
are scrubbing the bilge!

189
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,513
Not preppies. Preppers.

190
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,717
But I like your hatred.

191
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,227
It's based on nothing.

192
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,639
That's super.

193
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:43,397
Now, Homer, what would you do
in the case of an E.M.P.?

194
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,572
Electromagnetic pulse.

195
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,356
A burst of radiation

196
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,566
that knocks out every electrical
system in the country.

197
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,907
I'd slash my wrists.

198
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,871
But how, without my electric knife?!

199
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,412
There is an alternative to suicide.

200
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,326
Mm. I can't conceive of any.

201
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,674
We can teach you the skills
you need to survive any crisis.

202
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,591
-Ooh.
-All we ask

203
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,550
is that you keep
your prepping secret.

204
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,510
We won't have room for all the unprepared.

205
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:14,011
Don't worry. I'm very good
at keeping secrets.

206
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,175
"...impending doom."

207
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,354
-What you reading, Dad?
-(screams)

208
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,022
Honey, everything's fine.

209
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,481
There's nothing to worry about.

210
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,021
When grown-ups say that,

211
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,314
it means there <i>is</i> something
to worry about.

212
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,068
Just go play your saxophone.

213
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,529
While you can.

214
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,609
What does that mean?

215
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,034
Secrets?! I have no secrets!

216
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,823
Just enjoy this golden time

217
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,576
you will soon cling desperately
to the memory of.

218
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,699
Smell some bread!

219
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,158
When things go south,

220
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,708
the sheeple will clean out
every supermarket in town.

221
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,133
Typical sheeple.

222
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:50,801
Uh... are you eating my grain?

223
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,631
Maybe.

224
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,217
That was a five-pound bag!

225
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,053
Yeah, but I'll go home, weigh myself,

226
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,058
and I'll have gained six pounds.
What's that about?

227
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,771
<i>♪ Prep, prep, prep ♪</i>

228
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,441
(humming)

229
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,309
Hey, Dad, are we going camping?

230
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,606
I guess an open garage
isn't the best hiding place.

231
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,611
What's up? Going crazy again?

232
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,073
(scoffs) I wish.

233
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,493
Son, the best way to explain this is

234
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,332
to show you some age-inappropriate movies.

235
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,291
So, what have you learned so far

236
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,745
from our post-apocalyptic movie marathon?

237
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,256
Guys who call themselves
Preacher or Deacon are very bad.

238
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,010
Water is money, unless gasoline is money.

239
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:38,012
And even though lots of things
are razor-sharp, no one ever shaves.

240
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,595
Hollywood has taught you well, my son.

241
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,021
Now let's push play.

242
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,226
Now the Ice Bishop of Beverly Hills

243
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,864
will teach you the true meaning of cold!

244
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:55,862
(laughing maniacally)

245
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:59,366
I have come from a place
where the land is warm,

246
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,080
and the only ice is made
by machines called...

247
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,622
fridge-ra-torrs.

248
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:09,456
ALL (chanting):
Fridge-ra-torrs! Fridge-ra-torrs!

249
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,553
Fridge-ra-torrs!

250
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,339
Aren't they just saying "refrigerator"?

251
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,472
Do not question
the wisdom of Tom Skerritt.

252
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,178
Here it is, Homer.

253
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,431
The Springfield Preppers'
top secret Bug-Out Retreat.

254
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,434
Wow! Your end of the world

255
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,886
is better than my during the world.

256
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,186
Homer, we all know America's collapse

257
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,060
is about three months away.

258
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,767
Six weeks at most.

259
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,647
There's always one alarmist.

260
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,364
Anyway, when the Four Horsemen ride,

261
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,074
we want you and your collaterals
right here with us.

262
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:41,695
Aw. Uh, listen, I've got to know--

263
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,454
you're not just being nice to me

264
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,076
because in a pinch you could
make candles from my fat?

265
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,503
Well, that is a big part of it.

266
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,671
It's okay. I know what I am.

267
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,129
MARGE: Hmm?

268
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,672
I can't find all our cereal, crackers,

269
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,296
juice boxes, the butter brush...

270
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,144
Um... a lot of that stuff
must've got lost in the move.

271
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,061
What move? We haven't moved.

272
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,560
What's going on?

273
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:09,401
Oh! I want to tell you,
but I promised to keep it a secret.

274
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,308
You can't have secrets from your wife!

275
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,478
It's very late in the marriage
to tell me that.

276
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,068
I've hidden all our supplies
behind a fake wall.

277
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,405
I thought the basement looked cleaner.

278
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,830
See? These are our bug-out bags.

279
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,249
In here is everything we need to survive.

280
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,328
Survive what?

281
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,753
The looming kablooey.

282
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:33,042
It's reassuring to see
you're aware of the future,

283
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,757
but this is all a little... creepy.

284
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,968
Creepy?!
Marge, the apocalypse is coming.

285
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:42,259
Maybe not tomorrow, maybe never,
but it's coming.

286
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,764
And soon.

287
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,766
I'm going to bed.

00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,280
<i>Your cheese puffs. Those are doodles.</i>

292

Well, just because I imagined it,
doesn't make it any less true.

355
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,992
And now all those people are on their own.

356
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,359
How can you call yourself a Christian?

357
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,696
If Jesus had a gun, he'd be alive today.

358
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,533
Homer Simpson!

359
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,698
When I fell in love with you,

360
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,167
it was because of your big heart
and your good looks.

361
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,538
But some day, those good looks
are gonna fade.

362
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,667
What?!

363
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,376
Soon we'll be approached

364
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,844
by people who haven't prepared.

365
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,045
Now, do not look at their faces.

366
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,045
That can trigger feelings and emotions,

367
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,807
which have no place

368
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,480
in Civilization 2.0: Rise of the Weirdos.

369
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,600
I may have solved that problem.

370
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,438
This rifle scope I modified

371
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,783
makes any human face
look dangerous and threatening.

372
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,324
Boom.

373
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,077
Why do we have to shoot them at all?

374
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,198
Are you that good with a knife?

375
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,655
No! I want to help the people
who didn't prepare.

376
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,997
Boom. Boom.

377
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,003
-Boom.
-What'd you shoot me for?

378
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,585
You were thinking I'd gone mad
with power, weren't you?!

379
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,301
I wasn't, but I am now.

380
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,761
Boom-boom-boom-boom-boom.

381
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,095
(snoring)

382
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,846
-(muffled horn honking)
-(others gasp)

383
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,104
Oh, God, now what?

384
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,105
Every time you wake us up
early in the morning,

385
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,938
it's either church or we have
to change our identities.

386
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,605
Don't be silly, Mary Ellen.

387
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,244
Now, we're going to leave this place.

388
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,280
I'm sorry, Bart. I know you've made
a bug-out camp girlfriend.

389
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,735
I've got to be honest with you.

390
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,945
It was just a bag of rice
I drew a face on.

391
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,866
-White rice or brown?
-I never noticed.

392
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:19,964
Good boy.

393
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,869
So we'll take these supplies

394
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,707
back to Springfield,
where they're needed most.

395
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,133
You're a good man, Homer Simpson.

396
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,625
(alarm blaring)

397
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,637
You said you cut the wires to the alarm.

398
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,969
Hmm, I cut the wires to something.

399
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,480
Okay, everybody,
keep your eyes peeled

400
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,647
for an unlit mile post
marked "23" or "36" or something.

401
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,988
If we miss it, we're dead.

402
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,083
Dad, there are lights following us.

403
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,738
How can that be?
I took every last can of gas.

404
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,002
(horses whinnying)

405
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,745
Now, everyone relax and pretend
we're about to be hit

406
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,087
by a soft brick wall.

407
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,262
(screaming)

408
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,010
Out of our way, corn!

409
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,892
The starving people of Springfield

410
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,178
are desperately in need
of our delivery of canned corn,

411
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,602
corn flakes and flash frozen corn niblets!

412
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,186
(tires squealing)

413
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,646
I'm proud of you.

414
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:36,276
Society may have crumbled,
but our decency hasn't.

415
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,985
Now to save these sorry souls
from a life of anarchy,

416
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,366
starvation,
and having sex for procreation.

417
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,205
Huh?

418
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,045
Huh? Everything's normal.

419
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,471
The world didn't end!

420
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,930
Dad, you said people would be
drinking each other's blood.

421
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:01,771
You got to watch a VHS copy
of <i>Red Dawn</i> 13 times!

422
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,639
Stop complaining!

423
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,345
What happened with the E.M.P.?

424
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,595
Only Springfield lost power,

425
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,318
you see, and after a few days,
it came back.

426
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,899
Maybe a little bit brighter. (mutters)

427
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,145
And the spirit of neighborly
cooperation broke out

428
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,067
as if all the weird,
angry people had left.

429
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,987
Then society didn't crumble?

430
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,075
The zoo animals weren't eaten?

431
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,911
No-- well, a couple.

432
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:28,076
This non-disaster is a catastrophe!

433
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,377
Are you really so disappointed
the world didn't end,

434
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,341
just so you could be proven right?

435
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,802
No, no.

436
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,012
It's just that, in the new world,

437
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,342
I would have been a big shot.

438
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,968
Well, not for long.
Me and the others were planning

439
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,555
to overthrow you
and seal you in a cave.

440
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,941
Yeah, but what you didn't know

441
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,269
was I was gonna poison
all your drinking water.

442
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,524
Which is why I'm only drinking
my own urine.

443
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,528
(groans)

444
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,610
Guys, can't you see
that even an imperfect society

445
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,616
is better than the savagery
of creating a new one?

446
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,949
I for one am glad we're stuck
with civilization,

447
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:07,205
and I think we will be
for a long, long time.

448
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,875
I'm hungry.

449
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,966
Look, you can have potato chips now,

450
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,812
or if you wait ten minutes, you can have
all the brains you can eat.

451
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,229
-I want both.
-(groans)

452
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,154
-(murmuring)
-Shh.

453
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,945
