00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,041
I didn't.

173
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,674
You better freaking vote for it,

174
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,090
or we'll bust your face,
you little troll.

175
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,420
(moans weakly)

176
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:47,134
The anti-bullying law
has passed without objection.

177
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,466
Ow.

178
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,136
Hey, Simpson.
Come over and get your Christmas socking.

179
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,725
(siren whoops)

180
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,150
By the unregulated power vested in us

181
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,819
by the hastily passed bully law,
you're under arrest.

182
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,689
Take 'em away, boys.

183
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,607
Yeah, grab that hat.

184
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,816
Boys, I predict you're gonna
have clear sledding from here on out.

185
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,408
Uh, except on those sleds.

186
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,953
Uh, I'm gonna need 'em as evidence.

187
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,656
Uh, is that a candy cane, Milhouse?

188
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,536
'Cause, uh, yeah.
That-that's also evidence.

189
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,294
Mmm, mmm.

190
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,506
Uh, yes, Kent, the law gives us
broad authority here.

191
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:29,048
We're not just going after
your garden-variety nurple purpler.

192
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,183
No, no.
We're also arresting adult bullies.

193
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,351
The long-trouser crowd.

194
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,140
And let me tell you,
arresting people

195
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,524
who don't think they're criminals--
it's, uh...

196
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,311
it's a hell of a lot easier.

197
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,984
Yeah. Mmm.

198
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:47,277
All you worthless writers ever do
is stare into your phones.

199
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,900
Why don't you text me
some freaking jokes?

200
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,739
A TV star criticizing his writers.

201
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,496
What has this world come to?

202
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,078
Another bully for your collection, boys.

203
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,174
(grunts)
I need some prison jokes. Quick.

204
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,501
How about "Orange is the New Blecch"?

205
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,706
Beautiful.

206
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,047
Uh, yeah. A car just cut me off.

207
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:13,302
License JDB 653.

208
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,346
He's a bully.

209
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,009
(slurping)

210
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,268
(ice rattles)

211
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,889
Oh, and the guy that filled my soda
gave me mostly ice. Bully.

212
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,938
Mostly ice. Dear God.

213
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,821
I'll never grow
a tough enough skin for this job.

214
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,359
Excuse me, this is madness.

215
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,492
The ice costs me more than the soda.

216
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,820
Do you realize this?

217
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,574
<i>Ay, ay, ay.</i>

218
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,406
What hath Mom wrought?

219
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,741
The police are arresting
basically anyone they want to.

220
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,828
Lisa, you got to learn
to trust your government.

221
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,334
(whispers) That's what I do.

222
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,457
<i>-(electrical buzzing)</i>
<i>-(screams, groans)</i>

223
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,705
Daddy, can we make cocoa?

224
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,717
Boys, I'm afraid Mr. Simpson...

225
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,759
borrowed our mix and our mugs.

226
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,603
Why don't you ask for things back?

227
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,678
Are you being bullied?

228
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,433
Now, boys, I'm just turning
the other cheek, like Jesus.

229
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,386
Do you think he was bullied?

230
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,016
<i>(bullies laughing)</i>

231
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,274
<i>Come on, guys. Give it back.</i>

232
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,777
<i>Oh... forgive them, Father.</i>

233
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,610
<i>I raised a wuss.</i>

234
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,201
Dear Lord--
Please demonstrate unto us

235
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,374
Uncle Homer's not a jerk.

236
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,833
(Homer grunting)

237
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,343
See you in hell, old bed.

238
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,344
-(snoring)
-(whistling a tune)

239
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,671
Oh, come on, Chief.
Why am I in here?

240
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,968
You're a workplace bully.

241
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,181
Chief, I put my name on my lunch
because you are always eating it.

242
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,392
Bully! Bully! Bully!

243
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,643
-(phone rings)
-Springfield PD. Chief speaking.

244
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,556
Hello? We'd like to report a bully.

245
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,186
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh!

246
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,073
Wow. This bully's going down!

247
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,781
Yeah.

248
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,451
-(siren wailing)
-(banging at door)

249
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,700
Ooh, I wonder who this could be!

250
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,994
-(screams)
-Homer Simpson, I'm here to charge you

251
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,618
with multiple counts of bullying
your neighbor, Ned Flanders.

252
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,666
What the... Oh, I never dreamed
that a law I had abused

253
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,291
could be applied to me!

254
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,048
-All right, time for the perp walk.
-Walk?

255
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,550
But I just watered up the Slip 'N Slide.

256
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,933
-(reporters clamoring)
-(groaning)

257
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,469
I have no comment at this time!

258
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,313
I sentence you to 90 days treatment

259
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,479
in our new Biff Stiffler
Bully Reeducation Center.

260
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,938
-Is it a school?
-More like a prison.

261
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,939
Phew! Thank God.

262
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,521
MAN: Welcome, friends.

263
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,856
Welcome. Welcome. No need for names.

264
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,112
Well, there are need for names,
or there'd be billions of people

265
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,365
walking around without knowing
each other, but I meant here.

266
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:43,118
I know what you're going through
because I'm a recovering bully myself.

267
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,712
I was bullied for years and years.

268
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,288
I tried to solve it in a way
that I don't suggest.

269
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,344
I shot a man.
But that didn't fix it.

270
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,799
It fixed it for him. He died.

271
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,669
But I then went to a lot of training.

272
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:00,137
I went into the Army,
and I was punished,

273
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,559
and they told me I got over it.

274
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,558
I don't feel it,
but I'm told I got over it,

275
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,061
and I have something on the wall

276
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,853
-that says I do.
-Ow!

277
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:12,606
Time for step one on the path to empathy,
you maggots.

278
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,070
Can I do yard work like the kids?

279
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,401
-Your work is internal.
-You mean like vacuuming?

280
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,697
Did you really think I meant vacuuming?

281
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,661
When I said "internal,"
your brain went to something

282
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,253
inside your house like vacuuming?

283
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,908
Is that what you thought?

284
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,377
Do you know that's why
that Dyson is a billionaire?

285
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,169
Something is wrong with you
when you think vacuuming.

286
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,513
I'm talking about inside your head.

287
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,009
In your head!

288
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,260
Oh, it's so boring in there.

289
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,552
Oh, is it?

290
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:44,135
And I thought it might be
like the Louvre.

291
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,221
Now, no more talking!
I know how this works.

292
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,597
You find the toughest one,
you crack that person,

293
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,444
and the rest of you fall in line.

294
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,609
You'll never crack me.

295
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,978
(chuckles)
Ah, you're probably right.

296
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,395
Just like you never heard
your mother say,

297
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,735
"I love you."

298
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,279
(sobbing)

299
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:04,742
There's not enough tissue in the world
for what I'm feeling!

300
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,865
(sobbing)

301
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,161
There, there.

302
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,374
The first six tissues are free.

303
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,785
The rest you pay for.

304
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,253
Use the first two again.

305
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,883
They don't seem very wet.

306
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,839
Every bully is woven
from the colorful thread

307
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,881
known as humiliation.

308
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,474
Gary, who humiliated you?

309
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,720
Well... (clears throat)
my father was a psychologist.

310
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,564
He was a big believer
in the methods of B.F. <i>Skin-ner!</i>

311
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,391
I had to go through a hamster maze
to get to my breakfast.

312
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,188
Which way is love, Daddy?

313
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,271
(voice breaking)
Which way is love?

314
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,397
(crying)

315
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:41,993
He made me go through a maze.

316
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,821
Ah. Breakthrough.

317
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,277
Just sit down, Gary.

318
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,327
Have the free potato chips.

319
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,040
You, we'll just heavily medicate.

320
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,620
I'm sorry, there's no other hope.

321
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,575
{\an8}-Give me your money.
-Oh, beautiful.

322
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,497
{\an8}You're just proving my point.

323
00:13:56,585 --> 00:14:00,255
What about you, Homer?
Why do you hate this... Flanders?

324
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,589
Well, he thinks he's so perfect,
with his organized garage

325
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,346
and his barbecue grill
that never has crud on it.

326
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,098
That's very good. Keep exploring.

327
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,350
I'm already hating him a little bit.

328
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:13,232
Kids who love him and rub his back.

329
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,270
And he's got enough extra hair
for a mustache!

330
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,855
All I got are Archie and Wicket here.

331
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,861
I'm so bald.

332
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,363
Deeper. You've got to go deeper.

333
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,235
(in a deep voice) I'm so bald.

334
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,452
Deeper! And if you think
I mean underground,

335
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,874
I'm going to punch you!

336
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,042
Why do you hate Flanders?

337
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,291
Oh, everybody hates Flanders.

338
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,543
No, just you.

339
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,674
-That's right.
-(all agreeing)

340
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,710
He ain't no chooch.

341
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,843
Homer, you've got
to find the answer to this.

342
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,050
It's been bothering you your whole life.

343
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,221
Also, it's five to 11:00.

344
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,340
