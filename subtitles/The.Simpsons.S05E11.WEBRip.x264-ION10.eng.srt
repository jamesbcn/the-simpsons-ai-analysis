There was a burglar,
and he took my saxophone!

Whoo-hoo!

was a priceless

Bouvier family heirloom.

29
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,901
You probably got
a whole drawer full of 'em.

30
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,362
Well, yes, I do,
but they're all heirlooms too.

31
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,318
The burglar even took
my stamp collection.

32
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,826
You had
a stamp collection?

00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,799
That saxophone was
my one creative outlet.

38
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,682

Shh! Quiet, Lisa.

42
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,352

You folks
got robbed too?

46
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,396
The burglar took my
Shroud of Turin beach towels.

{\an8}Wow!
It's a crime wave.

48
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,824
Good Lord! My Stormin' Norman
commemorative plates stolen!

49
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,118

50
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,751
Hey, I thought I had
more stuff than this.

51
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,710
{\an8}We are insured,
aren't we, Mom?

52
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,250
Homer, tell your child
what you bought

53
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,594
when I sent you to town
to get some insurance.

54
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,839
Curse you, magic beans!

55
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,592
Oh, stop blaming the beans.

56
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,303
Hello, police?
Are you sitting down? Good!

57
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,054
I wish to report
a robbery.

58
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,466
A robbery, right.
Thanks for the report.

59
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,845
That's another one, Lou.
723 Evergreen Terrace.

60
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,515
Well, there doesn't seem
to be any pattern yet,

61
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,404
but if I take this one
and move it here...

62
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,822
and I move these
over here--

63
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,741
{\an8}Hello! It almost looks
like an arrow.

64
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,451
{\an8}Hey, look,

65
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,701
{\an8}Chief, it's pointing right
at this police station.

66
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:06,004
-Let's get out of here!
-(all screaming)

67
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,884
When cat burglaries start,
can mass murders be far behind?

68
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,711
This reporter isn't saying
that the burglar is

69
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,586
an inhuman monster
like the wolfman,

70
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,093
but he very well could be.

71
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,724
So, professor,

72
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,551
would you say it's time
for everyone to panic?

73
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,426
Yes, I would, Kent.

74
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,853
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

75
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,602
We have a major break
in the case.

76
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,395
We recovered
the burglar's handkerchief

77
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,478
from one of the crime scenes.

78
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,573
Now, one sniff
of this baby,

79
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,819
and our tracking dog
will be hot on his trail.

80
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,901
Gosh, look at me.
I'm sweatin' like a pig here.

81
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:44,618
Ah. Ah, man.
That's better.

82
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,121
All right.
Get the scent, boy.

83
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,412
Come on, get the scent.

84
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,615
-Now kill him! (yells)
-(growling)

85
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,627
-Hey!
-(gasping)

86
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,629
Ah, my jugular! Ah!

87
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,171
Oh! Any questions?

88
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,255
Well, as you can see,

89
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,219
when the burglar
trips the alarm,

90
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,430
the house raises
from its foundations,

91
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,390
and runs down the street and
around the corner to safety.

92
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,770
(nervous chuckle)

93
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,520
Well the--
the real humans won't, uh--

94
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,862
won't burn quite so fast
in there.

95
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:14,858
Aye!

96
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,860

97
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:22,323

101
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,539
All right!
Free laserium.

102
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,666
All the colors
of the 'bow, man.

103
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,715
Ow! Oh.
My cataracts are gone.

104
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,720
I can see again.
All the beauty of na--

105
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,723
Oh!

106
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,635
I'm blind. Oh, well.
Easy come, easy go.

107
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,805

108
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,395
(screams)
It's the cat burglar!

109
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,651
Please don't kill me!

110
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,693
Abe, can I borrow
your ointment?

111
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,147
Oh, it's you, Malloy.

112
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,566
All right.

113
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,494
But this time clean off
the applicator!

114
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,575
-(gunshot)

115
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:15,462
Thank you for coming.
I'll see you in hell.

116
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,541
All right. These are our new
family security rules.

117
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,958
Be home before dark,

118
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,126
and make sure
you're not followed.

119
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,344
Lock all doors
and windows.

120
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,344
And don't take candy
from strangers.

121
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,756
Marge, they're only human!

122
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,354
What's the point
of all these precautions?

123
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,470
I've already lost

124
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,136
the only thing
that matters to me.

125
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,515
Oh, Lisa, stop pining
for your saxophone.

126
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,152
I got you
another instrument.

127
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,149
-What, this jug?
-(rhythmic tones)

128
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:43,112
Hee-hee! (laughing)
Whee! Whoa-ho-ho!

129
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:48,696
Lisa, never, ever stop
in the middle of a hoedown.

130
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,993
(crying)

131
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,697
Oh, honey,

132
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,417
I didn't realize how much
that horn meant to you.

133
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:59,038
Don't worry.
Daddy's gonna get it back.

134
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,507
I don't know how but
I'll figure out something.

135
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,668
{\an8}Thank you.

136
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,427
You know, Lisa,
music helps Daddy think.

139
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,902
Since the police can't seem
to get off their duffaroonies

140
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,693
to do something
about this burglareeno,

141
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,527
I think it's time we start
our own neighborhood watch...

142
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,873
aroonie!

143
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,448
-(cheering)
-Now, who should lead the group?

144
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,204
-You!
-ALL: Yea!

145
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,246

Flanders! Flanders!

147
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,289
I don't really have
very much experience, but--

148
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,544
-Someone else!
-ALL: Yea!

149
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,706
(chanting)
Someone else!

150
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,844
Someone else!
Someone else!

151
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,841
-I'm someone else.
-He's right!

152
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,433
We don't need a thinker.
We need a doer.

153
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,969
Someone who'll act without
considering the consequences.

154
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,853
ALL: (chanting)
Homer! Homer! Homer!

155
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,181
-I'm with you, Homer!
-I be with ya too, matey.

156
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,727
-I'm with you, Homer.
-You're the man, Homer.

157
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,941
-You should do it.
-You're the man, man.

158
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,192
I'll join! I'm filled with
piss and vinegar.

159
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,494
At first I was just
filled with vinegar.

160
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,858
Hmm, sorry, Dad.
You're too old.

161
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,655
(sputtering)
Too old?

162
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,910
Why, that just means
I have experience!

163
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,083
Who chased the Irish out
of Springfield Village

164
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,122
in aught-four?

165
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,075
Me! That's who.

166
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,245
And a fine job
you did too.

167
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,094
Aw, Dad, you've done
a lot of great things,

168
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,341
but you're
a very old man now,

169
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,723
and old people
are useless.

170
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,890
-Aren't they? Aren't they? Huh?
-(giggling)

171
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,759
Yes, they are!
Yes, they are!

172
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,256
(baby talk)

173
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,268
Stop it!
It's a form of abuse!

174
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,481
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

175
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,061

00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,688
<i>On one of my frequent trips</i>
<i>to the ground--</i>

347
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,153
(yelps)

348
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:28,073
<i>I noticed Malloy </i>
<i>wore sneakers...</i>

349
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,993
for sneaking!

350
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,912
My next clue came
just yesterday

351
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,241
at the museum.

352
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,575
We felt slighted
by your age bashing

353
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,411
and started home.

354
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,286
<i>Malloy said,</i>
<i>"I'll catch up with you."</i>

355
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,835
<i>I couldn't quite</i>
<i>put my finger on it.</i>

356
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,933
<i>There was something strange</i>
<i>about the way he walked.</i>

357
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,680
<i>Much more vertical</i>
<i>than usual.</i>

358
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:57,642
And finally, Malloy,
unlike most retired people,

359
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,725
has the world's largest
cubic zirconia

360
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,230
on his coffee table.

361
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,232
Aw, Dad,
I could kiss ya!

362
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,824
Well, kiss me right here.

363
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:06,939
It's the only part
that still has feeling.

364
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,856
-Mwah!
-Hmm.

365
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,244
-(angry shouting)
-No, wait!

366
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,490
I know where the burglar is!

367
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,953
-To the retirement home!
-ALL: Hooray!

368
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,945
-MAN: Let's go!
-(angry shouting)

369
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,673
And there she is,

370
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,290
the world's largest
cubic zirconia.

371
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,297
What an eyesore!

372
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,919
So, Mr. Malloy,

373
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,716
it seems that the cat
has been caught

374
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,800
by the very person
that was trying to catch him.

375
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,518
-How ironic.
-Homer, old chap, well done.

376
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,349
If anyone
was going to catch me,

377
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,854
I'm glad it was you.

378
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:45,765
Actually, it wasn't me.
It was my dad, Grandpa.

379
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,776
Thanks, son.

380
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:51,648
So you see, old people
aren't so useless after all.

381
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,527
Malloy's old, and he
outsmarted the lot of you.

382
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,985
And I'm even older,
and I outsmarted him!

383
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,116
(laughing)

384
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,213
-Shut up.
-I've had my moment.

385
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,578
And of course,
I'm happy to return

386
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,625
all of your
treasured possessions.

387
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,999
(happy murmuring)

388
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,507
-Selma, my dear,
-Ohh.

389
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,298
your lock of
MacGyver's hair.

390
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:14,181
Thank you.
I'll add it to the ball.

391
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,757
And little Lisa,
here's your saxophone.

392
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,637
Thank you,
and thank you, Dad.

393
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,055
You got it back,

394
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,983
just like you said
you would.

395
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,692
I sincerely regret
any inconvenience

396
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,322
I may have caused,

397
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,728
and although I have stolen
your material goods,

398
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,448
let me assure you
that your dear town

399
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,489
has stolen my heart.

400
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,571
ALL: Aww!

401
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,617
-Oh, he's so charming.
-Let's let him go.

402
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,831
-Yeah!
-Oh, sorry, folks.

403
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,752
Gee, I really hate to spoil
this little love-in,

404
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,212
but Mr. Malloy
broke the law.

405
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,802
And when you break the law,
you gotta go to jail.

406
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,708
Uh, that reminds me.
Uh, here's your monthly kickback.

407
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,798
You just-- You couldn't
have picked a worse time.

408

HOMER:
I caught the cat burglar!

409
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,181
I caught the cat burglar!

410
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:03,063
That means you!
You are the cat burglar!

411
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,812
I suppose you're
wondering where I hid

412
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,273
all the millions of dollars
that I stole over the years.

413
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,983
-Shut up!
-Wait a minute.

414
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,363
Maybe we should hear him out.

415
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,189
Where'd you hide
the loot, Malloy?

416
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,275
It's buried right here
in Springfield,

417
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,990
under a big "T."

418
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,110
No kidding.

419
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,117
Big "T," huh?

420
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:23,499
Well, I guess I'll be going
to my home now

421
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,909
and sleep.

422
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,998
Yeah, me too.

423
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,463
I will also go home...
for sleep.

425
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,968
Let me through!
I gotta find a big "T"!

426

428

We need
more information.

429
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:55,235
Very well. It's buried
at 4723 Maple Valley Road.
