1
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:07,172
The Simpsons

2
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:11,711
D'oh!

3
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:30,730
BART: Woo-hoo!

4
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,505
St. Patrick's Day.
I love how they made the river green.

5
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:40,140
Actually, my nuclear plant did that.
And now that you know,

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,240
your life is in danger.

7
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:49,249
Greetings, fellow Irishmen
and lady Irishmen.

8
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:53,019
I, Joseph Fitzgerald O'Malley
Fitzpatrick O'Donnell...

9
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,755
'The Edge' Quimby,
welcome you to Springfield's...

10
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:58,792
...first booze-free St. Patrick's Day!

11
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,829
Come on, people.

12
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,765
Your drunken shenanigans
destroy this town every year.

13
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:09,436
And Ireland is so much more
than the imbibing of spirits.

14
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,604
The Irish gave the world the paddy wagon,

15
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:16,176
the shamrock shake, and folk dancing
where you don't move your arms.

16
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,247
Where's the IRA when you need 'em.

17
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,650
We renounced
the ways of the gun and the bomb.

18
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,155
In the old days
we would've been all over that.

19
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:52,178
Oh, no. The Northern Irish
are also having a parade.

20
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,781
Two kinds of Irish people?
What are they fighting over?

21
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,182
Who gets to sleep in the bathtub?

22
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:00,186
Actually, those Prots and Cathies
have hated each other for centuries.

23
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,556
It always comes down
to transubstantiation...

24
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:06,036
...versus consubstantiation.

25
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,268
Stop it, both of you!
You have a common land, a literature,

26
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,670
and the sweetest songs on earth!

27
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,534
Too-ra-Ioo-ra-Ioo-ral

28
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,734
Too-ra-Ioo-ra-li

29
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:27,040
Hush, my little baby

30
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,116
Hush now, don't you cry

31
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,911
ALL: Too-ra-Ioo-ra-Ioo-ral

32
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:38,156
Too-ra-Ioo-ra-li

33
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:41,853
Too-ra-Ioo-ra-Ioo-ral

34
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:47,957
That's an Irish lullaby

35
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,708
Oh, no! Without the booze,

36
00:02:55,808 --> 00:03:00,313
these guys all remember
how much they hate each other!

37
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,323
This was such a pleasant St. Patrick's Day
until the Irish people showed up.

38
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,658
Urchins!

39
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,862
They took my cupcakes!

40
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:20,066
All right, you unwanted
miracles, give back the lady's cupcakes.

41
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,968
You don't have the teeth for it.

42
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,870
Aye, but we could gum the frosting.

43
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,305
Well, if it's good gumming you're after,

44
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,408
wouldn't you rather have this
lovely cabbage?

45
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,543
CHILDREN: Cabbage, cabbage!

46
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,480
Here you go, ma'am.
Not a sprinkle nor jimmy askew.

47
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,810
Thank you so much, Mr...

48
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,484
Patrick Farrelly at your service.

49
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,320
Marge Simpson. Well, Mr. Farrelly,

50
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,075
the least I could do is offer you
a cupcake.

51
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,861
Mmm.

52
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:51,064
Light, moist, and such a marvelous
shape retention.

53
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,267
Marge, I own a small bakery.
Will you bake for me?

54
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,427
Me? A professional baker's employee?

55
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:00,852
Imagine how different my life would be.

56
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,844
Here we are at school, kids.

57
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,679
Hey, what are those boxes in the back?

58
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,779
Cakes!
- BOTH: See ya.

59
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,184
I'll do it!
- Bless your heart.

60
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,753
You won't regret it.
- I already don't.

61
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,151
Homer! I've got great news!

62
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,591
I'll use my one phone call
to find out all about it!

63
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,262
Mulk request change of venue.

64
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:31,827
Green monster cannot get fair trial
in downtown Springfield.

65
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,938
Granted.

66
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,643
Homer Simpson? You're a repeat offender.

67
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:37,710
Three-peat.

68
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,938
Bail is set at $25,000.

69
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,242
I make that in a year.

70
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:46,239
I suggest you see a bail bondsman.

71
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,691
Okay, Simpson.
All of your information checks out.

72
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,993
I called your boss
to verify your employment,

73
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,229
and he says you're fired
for getting arrested.

74
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,299
You'd be amazed how often that happens.

75
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,433
Oh!

76
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,968
We'll put up your bail money.

77
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:05,805
Just pay us 10 percent
and show up for your court date.

78
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,930
And if I don't show up?

79
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:12,612
Then you gotta deal with me.
The name's Wolf, and I'm a bounty hunter.

80
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:16,216
If someone skips bail,
I track 'em down and bring 'em back.

81
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,220
I also take a tooth, make a
plastic cast, put it on this necklace,

82
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,488
then replace the tooth at my expense.

83
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:25,558
Well, time to go back to my world
of sleazy bars,

84
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,927
tattoo parlors, and greasy spoons.

85
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:31,731
What a great job.
And I could use a job right now.

86
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,799
Whoa!

87
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,536
Not just anyone can be a bounty hunter.
You have to pass an online exam.

88
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,672
No, wait. They got rid of that.
There is a ten-dollar filing fee.

89
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:40,840
But you can get around it.

90
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,109
Congratulations.
You're now a bounty hunter.

91
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,209
Mmm.

92
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,642
Okay. I've set my trap.

93
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:51,551
Now to scatter my cheese cubes
and the rats will come.

94
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:55,781
Condos! Affordable condos!
Bail jumpers welcome!

95
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,992
'Bail jumpers welcome.' That's refreshing,

96
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:04,397
after the cold shoulder we got at the
Town Homes at Sterling Point.

97
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,226
Let's not get too excited till we...

98
00:06:06,326 --> 00:06:08,401
...find out if it's in
a good school district.

99
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:11,004
Well, so wait. Are we telling people now?

100
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:16,884
Stop! In the name of a private citizen
with no connection to the law!

101
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,849
Now are you gonna come quietly,
or do I have to...

102
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,184
...Now let's think about this.

103
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:28,788
If you shoot me,
I won't be able to stop you...

104
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:33,903
...and you'll be free to go.
But someone may come after you.

105
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,530
Probably not, given your reputation
for shooting people who come after you.

106
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,467
What I'm trying to say is,
not shooting me now...

107
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:45,401
...would be the biggest
mistake of your life.

108
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,582
Huh?

109
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:57,717
Bullet-proof glass.

110
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:58,951
Flanders?

111
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,354
Yep. I'm just replacing the front window
of my store,

112
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,919
which was broken in the riot.

113
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,892
Young man, what would your mother say...

114
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,995
...if she knew you were shooting
nice people in the brain?

115
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:13,599
She'd say that year off from Princeton
was the worst decision I ever made.

116
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,302
Well, son, if you take responsibility
for your actions,

117
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,038
this could be the start
of a better life for you.

118
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:22,175
Maybe you're right. Maybe I should just...

119
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,802
This case is in the bag!

120
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,482
Homer, you could've killed him!

121
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,217
I sure could've. Thanks to you.

122
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,057
Now I can clearly see potential customers
walk right past my store.

123
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,625
Enjoy your shopping elsewhere.

124
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,615
Hey, Ned. I brought you something.

125
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,633
What the...
- It's your share of the money...

126
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,269
...for bringing in that bail jumper.

127
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,673
Ned, I never thought I'd say this,
but we make a great team.

128
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:57,577
Us? A team? As the salad said to the soup,
I'm all mixed up.

129
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,812
We should be bounty hunters together.

130
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:03,015
You're kind and smart.
I'm cruel and strong.

131
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,684
Together, we're nothing.

132
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:08,221
But together,
we're the perfect bounty hunter.

133
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,958
Well, I could use money. But you have
to promise me something, Homer.

134
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:15,828
Sure. What is it?
- We have to do everything by the book.

135
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:19,866
And you have to promise
no 'diddilies' or 'doodlies.'

136
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,856
My friend, you have a dealaroonie!

137
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,507
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

138
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:39,385
Marge, your talent with cakes
is a rare and precious thing.

139
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:42,715
Well, thanks. But I've been wondering.

140
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:47,193
Why do you only have me make spheres,
rods, and half-moon shapes?

141
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,362
Well, Marge, I'll tell you,

142
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,599
Right after I talk to these customers.

143
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,737
We're going to a bachelorette
party for a really naughty girl.

144
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:01,374
Yeah. We need something tasty
and tasteless.

145
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,043
I've got just the thing,
courtesy of my newest baker.

146
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,268
Freshly frosted ass cake.

147
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,279
Oh, my God. This is an erotic bakery!

148
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,156
BOTH: Mmm.

149
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,591
Delicious.

150
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,727
Now what do you have
in the way of a suggestive cannoli?

151
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,037
We have quite a selection.

152
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:28,337
Yes! Oh, boy.
- I'll leave you with the book.

153
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,040
How could you not tell me
this is an erotic bakery?

154
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,876
Marge, calm down.
For as long as there's been baking,

155
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,580
there's been erotic baking.
It fills a need and harms no one.

156
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,649
Harms no one? Explain that to...

157
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,460
Well, what about...
I think you forgot about...

158
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:53,125
My number-one customers are married
couples, your friends and neighbors.

159
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,161
I just made a custom order
for the Hibberts.

160
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,563
It's an exact replica
of the good doctor's...

161
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,132
I don't want to know!
- It's not what you think it is.

162
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,400
Good.

163
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,937
It's his penis!
- That's exactly what I was thinking!

164
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,640
Marge, this is a valuable public service.

165
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,177
Without your baking, people like me
will be forced into back alleys,

166
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,546
repurposing Ho Hos and Ding Dongs.

167
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:17,641
You have a great gift.
Don't let it go to waste.

168
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,750
Well, okay.

169
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:27,593
This Taser is awesome!
Finally, a practical use for electricity.

170
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:31,197
Dear Lord, thank you for creating so
many evil criminals for us to bring in.

171
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,267
And also, thank you
for my partner Homer, who...

172
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,068
Did you just Taser my coffee?

173
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:40,039
Just warming it up.
Now to melt the cheese in this croissant.

174
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,441
And get rid of a little excess earwax.

175
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,438
And smoke a relaxing cigar.

176
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:52,952
Homer, can we take it easy on the Taser?
- No problem.

177
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,822
Our first bail jumper!
- Let's roll.

178
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,993
Homer, take the Taser out of your pants.

179
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,093
No, it looks cool!

180
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,264
Boy!

181
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,168
Boy!

182
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:16,242
Down in the street there is violence

183
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,744
And a lots of work to be done...

184
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,147
MAN: Who's there?
- Bible salesman.

185
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,148
No place to hang out our washing

186
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:28,152
And I can't blame all on the sun, oh no

187
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:32,350
We gonna rock down to Electric A venue

188
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,689
And then we'll take it higher

189
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:40,255
Oh, we gonna rock down to Electric A venue

190
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,199
And then we'll take it higher

191
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,465
Workin' so hard like a soldier

192
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:54,614
Daddy's home!
I brought you kids some stuff from work!

193
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,615
Here you go, son! Shell casings!

194
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,586
Whoa!
There's still bullets in some of these!

195
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:03,489
Point them away from your sisters
when you hammer them.

196
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:04,724
Yes, sir!

197
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:05,891
What'd you get for me?

198
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:09,362
Something for the sweetest little
scientist in the world.

199
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,462
A new chemistry set!

200
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:15,735
Dad, is this from a meth lab?
- The biggest one in town!

201
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,269
This is evidence.

202
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,429
Evidence that I love my little girl.

203
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:25,411
Marge, I brought you some flowers.
A full dozen this time! No tricks.

204
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:28,708
Homie! I got you something, too!

205
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,254
A sterling silver picture frame
with pictures of our kids in it.

206
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,354
Yes, for now.

207
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:40,459
I guess things are working out pretty good
at your bakery job.

208
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,362
Maybe we could order one of your cakes
for Lisa's birthday.

209
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,265
How dare you?
- What'd you do that for?

210
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,167
Sorry. Sorry. Muscle spasm.

211
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:52,405
I'm not convinced. Still on the fence.

212
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,505
Now I believe you.

213
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,591
He'll be here sooner or later.

214
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,686
So how about a little stakeout music?

215
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,488
Homer, I don't think we have
the same musical tastes.

216
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,157
Well, I like AC/DC.

217
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,959
I like their Christian cover band, AD /BC.

218
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:18,393
Kindly deeds done for free
Kindly deeds...

219
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,099
Done for free

220
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,362
Kindly deeds done for free

221
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:27,068
Kindly deeds and they're done for free

222
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:30,403
Kindly deeds and they're done for free

223
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,185
I've never seen anyone
eat pizza like that.

224
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,886
You gotta try it!

225
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,190
This way the pepperonis stay intact
until they reach your stomach.

226
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,290
Then bam!

227
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,462
Man! That's harder to swallow
than evolution!

228
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,997
You've gotta roll it from the point.

229
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,097
Here. Let me show you.

230
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,106
Not bad.
- Now let it unfurl in your stomach.

231
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,775
There he is!

232
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,118
Kitten whiskers!

233
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:18,678
There's one thing he didn't count on:
My reckless indifference to human life!

234
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:25,483
Lord, in your mercy,
could you give my friend a stroke?

235
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:32,238
Seymour, those string beans
were cooked to perfection.

236
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,474
After twenty years,
I am finally starting to like you.

237
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,043
Just wait for dessert, sir.
I made it with you in mind.

238
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,178
Outstanding.

239
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,482
I'll just shut my eyes
and let you place it before me.

240
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,554
AGNES: Seymour, what's going on?
I'm coming down there!

241
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,256
Quick! We'll have to eat from each end.

242
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:54,946
We'll know we're safe
when our lips meet in the middle.

243
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,666
Homer, you can't drive a car
onto a subway.

244
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,668
You need a special sticker
just to bring a bike!

245
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,370
Have you no respect for the law?

246
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,906
Hey, it worked, didn't it?
Okay, smart guy!

247
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,133
You're going in the bag!

248
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,678
Wait. I left a sandwich in there.

249
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:18,350
Homer, no. You promised. Everything
was supposed to be by the book.

250
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,718
You know what your problem is?

251
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:22,188
You haven't become as bad
as the people we chase!

252
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,589
This partnership is over!

253
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,429
I'll tell you what's
over: This partnership!

254
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,996
You know, if you'd take your foot off
the accelerator going downhill,

255
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,665
you wouldn't use so much gas.

256
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,910
I can't take another word out of you.

257
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,481
I can't believe Flanders dumped me.

258
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,745
Marge, do we have any more of your
extra-Iong Twinkies?

259
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:51,605
Oh, no! Those were for Mr. Smithers'
commitment ceremony!

260
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,319
Marge, what's going on?

261
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,791
Homie, I've got a confession to make.
I'm an erotic baker.

262
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,869
I hid it all in the one place
you'd never look.

263
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:08,167
Marge, I could see you withholding sex
or withholding cake.

264
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,477
But withholding sexy cake?

265
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:15,289
I know we have to move past this
but I don't see how.

266
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:21,203
Homie, what do you say we go to bed?
You, me, and the cake?

267
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,184
First, why don't you and I
and the cake take a shower?

268
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,284
Oh.

269
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,097
Lucky Jim, I'm out of
the bounty hunting business.

270
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:42,334
Not so fast, Ned. I got one more
bail jumper for you to pick up.

271
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,603
Forget it! I'm turning in my...

272
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,572
Well, I don't really have
anything to turn in.

273
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,375
So that's that!
I suggest you call Homer Simpson!

274
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:53,045
This is one jumper that Homer can't catch.

275
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:58,083
Homer?
- Seems he never showed up in court...

276
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,520
...on his St. Patrick's Day arrest.
- Not interested.

277
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:07,660
All right. If you don't want the job,
I'll just give it to one of these guys.

278
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,199
I'm sure they're all
competent professionals.

279
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,849
But you'd best leave it to me.

280
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,933
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

281
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,316
You jumped bail, Homer.
I gotta bring you in.

282
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,750
What have you done to my family?

283
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,354
I figured a good time to pick you up
was when they were at Lisa's recital.

284
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,289
And how did you know I wouldn't be there?

285
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,624
Lucky guess.

286
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,529
Well, you'll never take me alive!

287
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,228
Forgot my keys.

288
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,178
I loved you, man!
- For the last few weeks.

289
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,680
But most of the time I've known you,
you've treated me like dirt.

290
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,350
You hang onto resentment
like a Confederate widow!

291
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,886
I forgave you for accidentally
killing my wife.

292
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,188
Yeah. But you hold onto the big things!

293
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:19,658
The point is the more I got to know you,
the more I got to like you.

294
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:23,595
I like you, too. But you broke the law.
So I gotta bring you in.

295
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,330
So it's gonna be like that, eh?

296
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,222
I got you, my friend.

297
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,257
Thanks. But what are you holding onto?

298
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,425
Well, I'm...

299
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,067
Now all we have to do is get out
before the concrete hardens.

300
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,037
Damn it.

301
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,877
'Lest I come and strike the earth
with a curse.'

302
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,645
Thus ends the Book of Malachi.

303
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:16,715
I guess I did know the whole
Old Testament by heart.

304
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,451
Out with the Old, in with the New.
Testament that is.

305
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:23,288
Matthew 1.'The book of the genealogy
of Jesus Christ, the son of David,

306
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,790
'the son of Abraham.

307
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,294
'Abraham became the father of Isaac.
Isaac became the father of Jacob.

308
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,197
'Jacob became the father of Judah
and his brothers.

309
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:36,435
'Judah became the father of Perez
and Zarah by Tamar.'

310
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:40,038
Simpson, we're gonna put you away
for a long, long time.

311
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:43,113
Make it life and you've got a deal.

312
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:46,512
MARGE: Don't feel too bad, Homie.
You'll be free tomorrow.

313
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,481
And I used all my new baking skills...

314
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:54,075
...to make a special cake
to remind you of me.

315
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,156
Baby!

316
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,228
Thanks, Marge.
