00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,958
(grunts)

2
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:06,336
(caws)

3
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,255
(exclaiming)

4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,603
(school bell ringing)

5
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,651
(Barney belches)

6
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,401
(whistle blows)

7
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,112
(yells)

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,950
(beeping)

9
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,912
(playing the blues)

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,050
(gunfire)

11
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,059
(tires screeching)

12
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,020
(horn honking, Grampa shouts)

13
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,225
D'oh!

14
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,315
(tires screeching)

15
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,979
(grunts)

16
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,858
(bluesy jazz music playing)

17
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,864
(sirens wailing in distance)

18
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,816
(sign buzzing)

19
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,617
-(clicking)
-Hmm?

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,790
(clicking)

21
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,883
(scratching)

22
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,878
(footsteps approaching)

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,000
-You little!
-(gun cocks)

24
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,415
-(saxophone playing)
-(gasps)

25
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,138
(playing the blues)

26
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,299
(shotgun cocks)

27
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:41,058
(all growling)

28
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,532
(sighs)

29
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,938
-Mm?
-(ice clattering)

30
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,236
Hmm?

31
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,569
Mmm.

32
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,867
{\an8}(all gasp)

33
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,086
(kids chattering)

34
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,499
Everybody out.

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,220
Everybody in.

36
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:19,391
{\an8}-Bathroom break!
-I spilled my pills!

37
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,142
{\an8}Music today has no melody!

38
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,685
{\an8}-(tires screech)
-Everybody out!

39
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,064
{\an8}Children, you can stop
writing letters of support

40
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,018
{\an8}to our troops; that was just busywork.

41
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,277
Now, I want to explain
Miss Hoover's absence.

42
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,873
She is suffering from severe...

43
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,116
...depression.

44
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,621
(kids murmuring)

45
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,326
Not to worry,

46
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,376
she has been treated
with heavy doses of...

47
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,629
Lorazepam and other drugs from the...

48
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,092
Benzodiazepine family.

49
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,640
{\an8}Now, until Miss Hoover returns,

50
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,469
{\an8}this class will be getting
a permanent substitute.

51
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,055
{\an8}(excited chattering)

52
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,640
{\an8}Please let it be someone smart, motivated,

53
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,226
{\an8}and who won't just teach us
corporate-sponsored lessons.

54
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,823
{\an8}Lisa, without corporate sponsorship,

55
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,529
{\an8}we wouldn't be able to teach you
the three R's:

56
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,739
{\an8}reading, refreshment,
and Raspberry Buzz Lite.

57
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,989
{\an8}Get your razz on!

58
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,490
{\an8}(tires screech outside, kids murmuring)

59
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,825
{\an8}Confident,

60
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,700
{\an8}Vassar sticker on the windshield.

61
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,246
{\an8}(gasps) Could it be?

62
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,420
{\an8}Do I detect enthusiasm?

63
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,998
{\an8}She's brought her own orrery!

64
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,205
{\an8}And it's got no Pluto!

65
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,916
{\an8}How cutting edge.

66
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,176
{\an8}Please be her, please be her.

67
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,508
{\an8}Is this Ms. Hoover's class?

68
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,593
{\an8}(quietly) Score!

69
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,177
{\an8}Meet your new teacher, Ms. Cantwell.

70
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,813
{\an8}Do not call her by
the obvious dirty nickname.

71
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,771
{\an8}Now I must meet with
the new art teacher, Mr. Testacleese.

72
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:49,773
{\an8}(snickering)

73
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,154
{\an8}Lisa Simpson. Hi.

74
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,152
{\an8}As second grade student-faculty liaison,

75
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,364
{\an8}-I'd like to welcome you...
-Get back in your seat.

76
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,034
{\an8}If I have any apples that need polishing,
I'll let you know.

77
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:02,083
{\an8}I understand there are
homework assignments.

78
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,868
{\an8}Mm.

79
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,042
{\an8}Well done, Ralpa.

80
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,000
{\an8}If I can't remember the right letter,

81
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,621
{\an8}I just put an "A."

82
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,327
{\an8}Well, here's another one.

83
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,547
{\an8}Well, while you're grading
so generously, here's mine.

84
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,130
{\an8}"B."

85
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,045
{\an8}-As in, "because I say so."
-(gasps)

86
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,644
{\an8}(Lisa groaning)

87
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:27,021
{\an8}Nothing brings them around
like old cafeteria meatballs.

88
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,270
{\an8}Meat?!

89
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,845
{\an8}(Lisa groaning)

90
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:35,067
{\an8}I thought you might be cold, honey,
so I put this chinchilla coat on you.

91
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,779
{\an8}-Fur?! (gasps)
-(chuckles)

92
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,200
{\an8}It's not really chinchilla.

93
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,699
{\an8}I just thought she needed more sleep.

94
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,701
{\an8}(doorbell rings)

95
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,243
{\an8}Hey, Flanders.

96
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,996
{\an8}-Can I borrow some sugar?
-Sure.

97
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,158
{\an8}-Uh, a little cream?
-Goes with the sugar.

98
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,077
{\an8}Now if you could make with
some bacon and eggs,

99
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,205
{\an8}I'll be on my way.

100
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,582
{\an8}(sighs)

101
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,708
{\an8}Why don't you come on in
and have breakfast with us?

102
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,255
{\an8}Are your kids gonna be there?

103
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,378
{\an8}Eh, for a little bit.

104
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,474
{\an8}(sighs) Okay.

105
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,550
{\an8}Homer, you know my parents,
Capri and Nedward.

106
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,045
{\an8}Hey, hey, Homer J.

107
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,257
{\an8}How many beers did you kill today?

108
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,807
{\an8}(laughing)

109
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,310
{\an8}Dad, don't encourage him!

110
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,402
{\an8}Son, you are the Mayor of Dullsville.

111
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,808
{\an8}Now, you know we don't
discuss politics at the table.

112
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,227
{\an8}Hello, police?

113
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,816
{\an8}I'd like to report
a buzz-kill in progress.

114
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,321
{\an8}There's no emergency here.

115
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,573
{\an8}And please charge us for the false report.

116
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,736
I'm going out for a power walk.

117
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,865
Whoa, this room just got
a whole lot cooler.

118
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,253
-(laughter)
-Oh, man.

119
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,264
(both sigh)

120
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,299
Okay, children, ten minutes of free play.

121
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,553
-(kids chattering)
-I'm a fun factory.

122
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,468
Lisa, free play.

123
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,227
But I am playing.

124
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,439
I'm hop-scotching
from paragraph to paragraph,

125
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,809
climbing the monkey bars
of plot and theme.

126
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,397
Ugh, bull-pie.

127
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,402
You're trying to get ahead
of the other children.

128
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,444
That's it, you're losing joeys.

129
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,030
Please keep them together.

130
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,775
If not for me, for the mother.

131
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,913
<i>LISA:</i>
<i>(gasps)</i>

132
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,536
<i>Is it possible I've met</i>
<i>a teacher who doesn't like me?</i>

133
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,794
The joeys go in feet first. (chuckles)

134
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,797
(gasps) Chauncey!

135
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,259
(panting)

136
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,549
Six miles, and I'm all smiles.

137
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,137
Whew.

138
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,138
Funyuns? Little Debbies?

139
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,562
-(sitar playing)
-That's cross-legged music.

140
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,641
(laughter)

141
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,482
Look at the size of that bird.

142
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,824
I'd go Henry VIII on those drumsticks.

143
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,741
Homer, I can't believe

144
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,570
you're partaking with my parents.

145
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,985
Yeah, it's medicinal.
We had a pain in our neck.

146
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,164
(laughter)

147
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,044
(laughter continues)

148
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,344
(grunts)

149
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,172
I didn't know you were left-handed.

150
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,927
(groans)

151
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,637
Homer, you'll need to wear this eye patch

152
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:17,937
for a couple weeks.

153
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,230
And, uh, you may never
see a film in 3-D again.

154
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,855
(laughs)

155
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:27,112
But the storytelling
is finally catching up to the technology.

156
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,696
Ned Flanders.

157
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,701
I can't believe you struck my husband.

158
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,414
Marge, I've been
racked with guilt and pain.

159
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,865
My mustache fell out; this is a clip-on.

160
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,877
Sorry, Homer. Now, do you mind
if I pray at your bedside?

161
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,050
No, I don't. If you pray to Superman.

162
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,670
(chuckles) Not praying to a character
in a comic book.

163
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,627
What about Christian Archie comics?

164
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,468
Neither canonical nor comical.

165
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,183
Here, I'll get you started.

166
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,563
Hail Superman, wearing tights,

167
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,310
Clark Kent be thy name,

168
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,642
one nation, under Zod...

169
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,438
-Not praying to Superman.
-Grouch.

170
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,691
Ned, Homie's a little cranky right now.

171
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:06,243
More than his eye,
I think you hurt his feelings.

172
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,489
Give him one of your
famous murmurs, Marge.

173
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,991
-My what?
-Your famous murmur.

174
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,452
You know. (murmurs)

175
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,293
I never made that noise in my life!

176
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,748
(murmurs)

177
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,248
Thanks, Flanders.
Punch my eye, destroy my marriage.

178
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,501
Now just pull the plug and let me die!

179
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,173
That's the plug for the light.

180
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,251
(imitating flatline)

181
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,587
(sighs)

182
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,139
(yawns)

183
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,930
Neddy, I know you feel guilty
about coldcocking Homer.

184
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,555
Please don't use that word in bed.

185
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,312
(groans) You need to get some sleep.

186
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,154
(sighs) Dare I take another sleep aid?

187
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,270
(sighs)

188
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,358
Better not take a full dose.

189
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,532
Mmm. See you in eight hours.

190
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,735
(snoring)

191
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:57,454
(groaning)

192
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,077
(gasping)

193
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,245
(screams)

194
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,045
(gate creaks)

195
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,508
Was this always waiting for me,

196
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,298
or was it recently thrown together?

197
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,682
That's what I want to know.

198
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,509
<i>MALE VOICES: ♪ Hey-diddly hell-diddly ♪</i>

00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:25,055
Down here, we worship
famous atheist Richard Dawkins,

00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,857
author of <i>The God Delusion!</i>

204
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,072
(laughs maniacally)

205
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,822
I'm making Catholic saint stew.

206
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,615
(gasping)

207
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,249

00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,336
No, not Surf 'n Murph.

210
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,932

00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,684
Nope, not that. Not to my taste.

00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,847
Flag that for later. Finally.

214
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,767
I know what I must do.

215
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,477
(school bell ringing)

216
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,318
(sighs)

217
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,863
-Ms. Cantwell?
-Yes?

218
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,616
-Why are you so mean to me?
-You really want to know?

219
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,159
More than I want unicorns to be real.

220
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,253
Well, if you guess,
I'll give you extra credit.

221
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,709
-I remind you of you?
-Now you've got a demerit.

222
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,539
This class doesn't give demerits.

223
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,415
Now it does,
and you just got another one.

224
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,841
What if I homeschool?

225
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,669
You're bluffing; I've driven by your home.

226
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,165
(gasps)

227
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,756
Principal Skinner...

228
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,261
Not now.

229
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,933
I'm dealing with Mr. Testacleese.

230
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,101
Look, kids can be cruel, Dick.

231
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,430
NELSON: Ha-ha!

232
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,184
We don't know when we've gone too far!

233
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,564
(growls)

234
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,110
"Ann, Mark, Bill and Sally
are on the Ferris wheel.

235
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,693
Ann is behind Sally.

236
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,908
Mark is in front of Bill." (gasps)

237
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,198
Look who's on the Ferris wheel.

238
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,532
Your precious joeys!

239
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,578
(laughs maniacally)

240
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,960
(panting)

241
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,962
Better switch to social studies.

242
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:14,125
"Eleanor Roosevelt became
Franklin's eyes and ears and..."

243
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,675
(gasps)

244
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,588
Here's the new deal: you fail!

245
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,677
(cackling)

246
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,888
(groans)

247
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,306
(grunts) Oh!

248
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,645
I wish you wouldn't wear sweaters

249
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,519
that the senior ladies knit.

250
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,066
Well, putting my arms in sleeves

251
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,689
is about all I got to offer a woman.

252
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,777
-(groans)
-What's the matter, sweetie?

253
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,323
Is a book character having difficulties?

254
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,028
I have a bully at school.

255
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,198
Oh. Did you tell the teacher?

256
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,536
My bully is my teacher.

257
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,712
A teacher can't be a bully.

258
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,541
Oh, they sure can!

259
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,336
When I was a boy,

260
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,460
teachers would rap my knuckles
with a yardstick.

261
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,007
Now you've got the metric system.

262
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,842
We don't have the metric system.

263
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,887
What? This isn't Sweden?

264
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,641
And I'm not King Olaf?

265
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,393
Oh, I got some explaining to do
down at the bank.

266
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,107
CHALMERS: Skinner!

267
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,569
Why am I here?

268
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,989
Did this fat boy injure his eye
in shop class?

269
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,608
That place is a killing field.

270
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:21,775
We're here because our daughter
is being bullied by your teacher.

271
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,366
Mrs. Simpson, this school
does not hire bullies.

272
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,372
-That's right. We...
-Quiet, nerd!

273
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,964
Well, she's just a substitute.

274
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,038
Maybe you could transfer
Ms. Cantwell to another school.

275
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,285
Nix. She's already got two weeks tenure,

276
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,707
so she's impossible to dislodge.

277
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,546
I hate unions.

278
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,091
There's this guy at my plant,
caused three meltdowns,

279
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,006
and he still keeps his job.

280
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,304
Homer, that's you.

281
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,387
Oh, yeah.

282
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,562
I say, "Union," you say, "Power"!

283
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,730
-Union!
-Power.

284
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,058
-Union!
-Power.

285
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,563
(quietly) Marge, you're really
dogging it on the "power."

286
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:55,565
But don't worry.
Because of the union, you're safe.

287
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,899
So, just what are you
gonna do for our daughter?

288
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,645
We should talk about what
we're going to promise to do,

289
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,818
not what we'll actually do.

290
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,906
We really appreciate that.

291
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,161
(murmurs)

292
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,492
(bird squawks)

293
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,118
Look at those eyes.

294
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,785
There's an employee with
a healthy case of the go-get-'ems.

295
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,174
(snoring)

296
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,960
Hear that lion's roar of determination.

297
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,335
Homer, Homer, I found the answer!

298
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,423
Wha...? Huh?

299
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,428
Flanders. How did you get in here?

300
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,470
This place is a highly-sensitive area.

301
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,183
Who here wants to touch radiation?

302
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,944
"Life shall go for life,
eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth."

303
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,938
Hey, I don't go to where you work
and read the Bible to you.

304
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,941
I would embrace such a glad visit.

305
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,193
Just what do you want?

306
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,614
I want you to punch me in the eye.

307
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:40,993
If you do, then we're even,

308
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,360
according to Exodus,
Leviticus and Matthew.

309
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,367
You went and hired a law firm, eh?

310
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,779
That's pretty aggressive.

311
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,037
(sighs)
Jeepers creepers, pop my peeper!

312
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,619
Come on, man. What's the catch?

313
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,794
Homer, just call me a little bubble,

314
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,293
'cause I'm on the level. Punch me.

315
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,046
Hmm.

316
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,759
Come on, Homer.

317
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,223
I'm insisting on a fisting.

318
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,262
What's this about a fisting?

319
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,636
I'm not punching you, Flanders.

320
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,892
What? Why?

321
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,184
Because if I hit you back, we'll be even.

322
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:16,808
But if I don't hit you,
that makes me the better man.

323
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,187
And I'm liking the way that feels.

324
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,815
No, you can't.

325
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,071
If I'm not as good as you,
then I'm horrible!

326
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,163
It's not for me to judge, Ned, because...

327
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,909
I am the better man!

328
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,031
-Now, there's no need to...
-Better man, coming through!

329
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,948
Way better-better-better!
Way better-better-better!

330
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,787
-Zing!
-Enough.

331
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,253
You may be the sweater man,
but Homer is the better man.

332
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,793
-Now you're rhyming?!
-Oh!

333
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,338
I didn't know you were left-handed.

334
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,308
Hello, Lisa.

335
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,429
I was shocked to hear
from Principal Skinner

336
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,306
that you and I aren't getting along.

337
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,653
You should never tell on a bully, Lisa.

338
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,309
Everyone knows that.

339
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,904
Lisa Simpson?!

340
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:02,994
In detention?

341
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,148
Every rap sheet has a first line.

342
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,567
What are you in for, murdering Chopin?

343
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,986
(laughter)

344
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,664
Chopin.

345
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,243
Can I ask you guys something?

346
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,328
Why does someone become a bully?

347
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,833
-Neglect.
-Abuse.

348
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,535
I'm a Cubs fan.

349
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,035
But why would my teacher be a bully?

350
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,837
-What? Huh?
-I don't know.

351
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,211
Your bully's a teacher?

352
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,297
That means all of us can be teachers.

353
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,643
Boo-yah!

354
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,848
I'm gonna buy me a Hyundai Elantra!

355
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,599
-Oh, cool!
-Whoa!

356
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,810
(sighs)

357
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,438
Do not cross.

358
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,109
It is that monster
that terrorizes the jolly fat man!

359
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,439
Come on, people.
You're safe as Sunday with me.

360
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,944
I wouldn't hurt a fly.

361
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,284
(coughing, gagging)

362
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,993
I saw the whole thing!

363
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,453
That innocent fly
flew from that fresh pile

364
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,834
of dog feces right into
that monster's mouth!

365
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:56,793
(spits)

366
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,252
Fear not, people.

367
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,462
I will lead you safely across.

368
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,252
(horn honking)

369
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,456
-MAN: Idiot!
-Help me, Flanders.

370
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,966
(sighs)

371
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,091
Never get into Heaven.

372
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,256
Took harp lessons for nothing.

373
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,675
<i>ANNOUNCER (over TV):</i>
<i>And here comes the tarp.</i>

374
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,604
{\an8}<i>The word "tarp," of course,</i>
<i>is short for "tarpaulin,"</i>

375
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,024
<i>which Wikipedia defines as a strong,</i>

376
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,233
<i>resilient, water-resistant material.</i>

377
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,273
<i>That definition is a hit with no errors!</i>

378
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,188
What's wrong, sweetie?

379
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,946
My teacher's still bullying me.

380
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,658
Even after we came to school?

381
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,068
(sniffles)

382
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,826
That just made it worse.

383
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,038
Oh, every time I try to fix things,

384
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,789
it just makes things worse.

385
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,040
But I'm gonna fix this.

386
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,793
Uh-huh.

387
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,214
I think I have an idea.

388
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:47,303
<i>Now there's a baby duck</i>
<i>paddling around on the tarp.</i>

389
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:51,051
<i>You think they move those legs</i>
<i>one at a time or both at once?</i>

390
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,215
<i>ANNOUNCER 2:</i>
<i>Oh, I'd go with one at a time, Vic.</i>

391
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,513
<i>ANNOUNCER: You know,</i>
<i>the great Mel Ott used to raise ducks</i>

392
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,097
<i>in Louisiana during the off-season.</i>

393
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,932
<i>And when a duck got sick,</i>

394
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,398
<i>he would take it to bed with him</i>
<i>till it got well.</i>

395
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,598
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

396
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,108
(doorbell rings)

397
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,940
Flanders, I've come to forgive you.

398
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,237
Oh, my prayers have been answered!

399
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,030
Well, actually, just this one.

400
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,704
Uh, there is one condition.

401
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,993
You want to hit me.
Well, sir, here's a roll of quarters

402
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,787
to put in your fist
for extra punching power.

403
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,251
Now, you can shatter my orbital bone.

404
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,621
That'll knock the wax off my candle.

405
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,628
Don't want to hit you.
I want your wife.

406
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,211
(gasps)

407
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:34,089
To elaborate,
I want your wife, the teacher,

408
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,808
to help get rid of Lisa's substitute.

409
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,269
Edna? You know how you said
you could help me

410
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,889
with any desire,
and nothing was forbidden?

411
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:45,187
Well, sir, I want you
to get rid of Lisa's bully teacher.

412
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,902
Ooh. Well, there's only one way:
the nuclear option.

413
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,704
How much plutonium do you want?
Got to warn you,

414
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,159
it might take me 20 minutes to get it.

415
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,410
-Ms. Cantwell?
-Yes?

416
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,957
I have a new student for your class.

417
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,041
(demonic voices singing)

418
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,667
-Yo.
-Yes.

419
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,724
This is a very rare mid-year
two-grade send-back.

420
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,879
Something's fishy.
Are you dating this boy?

421
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,967
Right. I can't be around him
'cause he's so delicious.

422
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:18,965
(laughs)

423
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:22,386
Well, I can't see
what harm one kid could do.

424
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:37,203
When I come out of this,
I'll be a butterfly.

425
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,202
(lawnmower whirring)

426
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,285
I just went to the bathroom
for two minutes.

427
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,411
I know. Posted a video online.

428
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,578
<i>Stupid Lisa, stupid Lisa, stupid Lisa.</i>

429
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,208
Okay, you've won.

430
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,594
You've driven me out of this

431
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,841
plum substitute teaching job.

432
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,763
Ms. Cantwell, I can make this stop.

433
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,263
All you have to do is like me.

434
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,005
I... I can't.

435
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,191
Wait, wait. There's no need to leave.

436
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,859
You showed up before
the students; that's all we asked.

437
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,068
You two are the worst-dressed
gay men I've ever met.

438
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,319
(tires screeching)

439
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,990
Ms. Cantwell, wait!

440
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,898
I've got to know before you leave.

441
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,817
Why don't you like me?

442
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,155
Lisa, sometimes you just
don't like a person.

443
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,081
There's no logical explanation.
It just is.

444
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,951
That is so unsatisfying.

445
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,247
(sighs)

446
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,750
Here we go.

447
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,382
If you don't get what you want,
you get all pouty.

448
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,458
All you pretty girls are the same.

449
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,964
You think I'm pretty?

450
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,755
Right, like you don't get told that
every day of your life,

451
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,430
with your perfect blonde hair,

452
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,048
that Kewpie doll voice
that drives the boys crazy.

453
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,556
And what eight-year-old wears pearls?

454
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,848
Bookworms like me
can't stand party girls like you.

455
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:48,103
She hates me because I'm pretty!

456
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,977
(whoops)

457
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,903
Not so pretty now, are you?

458
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,902
Can you sign my yearbook?

459
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,452
I'm glad the only beef between us
is this burger.

460
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,819
Mm, they sure are getting along.

461
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,777
(laughs) They don't know it,

462
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,237
but I slipped a little (whistles)

463
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,368
into the brownies I gave them.

464
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,252
How long has it been since
we prayed together, neighbor?

465
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,794
This is praying? Let me out of here!

466
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,458
(whimpering)

467
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,425
{\an8}<i>HOMER: Help me, God.</i>

468
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,142
Shh!
