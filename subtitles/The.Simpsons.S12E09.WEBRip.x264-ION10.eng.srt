{\an8}Animation is so great.

{\an8}It's way better than

{\an8}whatever the alternative is.

13
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,104

{\an8}Wait, I'm confused.

27
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,515
{\an8}Why was a wolf shooting a web?

28

{\an8}Cartoons don't have to make sense.

{\an8}He's right, you know.

30
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,654
{\an8}Daddy, are you sure it's OK
for us to watch cartoons?

31
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,987
{\an8}Mm-hmm. This one's fine and dandy, Roddy.

I don't know, Gravey.

38
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,724
I'm sick of your lack of faith.

39
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,470
Hmm?

All I need is some courage.

{\an8}Courage, I tell you.

46
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,111
{\an8}Excuse me, but isn't that voice

47
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,275
{\an8}very similar to the Cowardly Lion?

48
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,873
{\an8}Also, sir, your Loudmouth Leopard

That motion-capture suit is
just what this country needs.

99
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,102
Just think of all the hilarious motions

100
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,771

102
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,980
See? Now wouldn't you love
to see that move

103
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,025
performed by a cartoon possum?

104
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:02,358
An opossum capering around like that
would be a smash hit.

105
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,565
That would be the world's
funniest marsupial.

106
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:08,195
You're right. That suit gizmo
could be worth billions.

107
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,584
And I'm going to get
a piece of the action.

109
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,668
So, does he still work here, or what?

110
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,219
I'd like to withdraw my life savings,
please. And hurry!

111
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,339
Uh, sir, this is a joint account.

112
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,676
Uh, you'll need
your wife's signature, too.

113
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,349
Oh! Yes, of course.

114

(as Homer) No, no. No candy for you.

121
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,164

get some candy for yourself.

Uh, sir, your life savings.

127
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,710
Uh, yes, I see that it's in bill form.

128
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:03,837
Excellent.

129
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,299

00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,690
Come on, Marge. We're a team.

178
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,228
It's uter-us, not uter-you.

179
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,403
-Forget it.
-Hmm.

180
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,775
You know, Homer, I got
a great way to make money.

181
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,492
I'm a human guinea pig.

182
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,163
You mean, like medical testing?

183
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,241
Yeah, medical, military, chewing stuff.

184
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,197
-Chewing stuff?
-Yeah,

185
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,958
like you chew on a telephone wire

186
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,249
till you get a shock.

187
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,212
Oh, oh, right. OK.

188
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,253
Yeah, but aren't
those experiments dangerous?

189
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,336
Ah, you get a few side effects.

190
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,342
-Are those ears?
-Ow! Not so loud!

191
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,969
Hmm...

192
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,351
First, we'll test this
experimental perfume on you.

193
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,194
It burns! It burns!

194
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,349
-(screaming)
-Hmm...

195
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,818
-We'll call it "Desert Breeze."
-ALL: Mm-hmm.

196
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:12,569
(humming)

197
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,073
That appetite suppressant is amazing.

198
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,276
Homer, you really have
no desire to eat that food?

199
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,247
Food? I'm blind!

200
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,709
(screaming)

201
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,999
Who's going to buy a pill
that makes you blind?

202
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,423
We'll let marketing worry about that.

203
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,462
(grunting)

204
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:34,884
(beeping, buzzing)

205
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,007
D'oh!

206
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,802
D'oh!

207
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,890
Where did that rat come from?

208
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,603
He must have brought it in with him.

209
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,853
-Hmm...
-(buzzes)

210
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,305
Damn it.

211
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,895
Man, is he dumb.

212
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,480
Where do they get these subjects?

213
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,935
He's a little too well-fed to be a wino.

214
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,486
Hey, what's that?

215
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,453
Zoom in on section eight.

216
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,158
Rotate 20 degrees.

217
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,123
(beeping)

218
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,544
(both gasping)

219
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,883
Mr. Simpson, I'm afraid you have a crayon
lodged in your brain.

220
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,423
There's a crayon in my brain?

221
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,513
But I've had thousands of head x-rays.

222
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,505
How come no one ever noticed it before?

223
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,177
Oh, I can answer that.

224
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,135
You see, whenever I pick up an x-ray,

225
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,846
I always hold it like this.

226
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,648
My thumb must have covered up
the crayon every time.

227
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,231
(chuckling)

228
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,066
I'll show myself out.

229
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,031
Do you have any idea
how this might have happened?

230
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,412
Well, I'm not sure,
but it might have happened

231
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,830
when I was six.

232
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,907
Fourteen,

233
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,866
fifteen,

234
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,377
sixteen!

235
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,462
Whoo-hoo!

236
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,671
Oh, I don't feel so good.

237
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,336
(sneezing)

238
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,886
Uh, I think that's all of them.

239
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,970
Mr. Simpson, this could be responsible

240
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,135
for your subnormal intelligence.

241
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,684
Hey, I came here to be drugged,

242
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,057
electrocuted and probed, not insulted.

243
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,105
We could remove the crayon for you.

244
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,688
It could vastly increase your brain power,

245
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,074
or it could possibly kill you.

246
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:19,201
Hmm... increase my killing power, eh?

247
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,237
Let's do it.

248
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,203
-(vehicle approaching)
-(tires screeching)

249
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,001
Oh, Homer, where have you been?

250
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,078
I just underwent a procedure
to increase my IQ 50 points.

251
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,246
-Really?
-And they gave me

252
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,924
this spiffy nerd ensemble, too.

253
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,924
Do you feel smarter?

254
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,756
Is the capital of North Dakota Bismarck?

255
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,218
It is.

256
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,013
I don't believe it.
Say something else smart.

257
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,887
Dr. Joyce Brothers may be well known,

258
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:50,144
but her psychological
credentials are highly suspect.

259
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,097
It's true!

260
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,688
-Oh!
-(all gasping)

261
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,863
Now, who's up for a trip
to the library tomorrow?

262
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,912
Notice I no longer say
"liberry" or "tomorry."

263
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,158
I'd love to go to the library with you.

264
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,740
It's a date.

265
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,035
Dad, did you read all these books today?

266
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,754
Everything from <i>Hop on Pop</i>
to <i>Death Be Not Proud.</i>

267
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,796
It's so tragic the way they hopped on Pop.

268
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,341
I always dreamed
you'd be my library buddy.

269
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,135
-Get out.
-No, really.

270
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,179
I think books have an amazing
power to bring people together.

271
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,933
Look, even Cletus is checking one out.

272
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,559
Now, hold still.

273
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,904
Nothing cracks a turtle like Leon Uris.

274
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,225
Ow! Dang it! Ow!

275
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,897
-(piano sonata ending)
-ANNOUNCER: <i>That sonata may not be</i>

276
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,316
<i>a Glenn Gould performance,</i>

277
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,494
but I must say it's "good as Gould."

278
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,124
(laughing)

279
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,040
Hey, Flanders, heading for church?

280
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,121
Well, I thought I could
save you a little time.

281
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,077
Ooh, found a new shortcut?

282
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,877
Better. I was working
on a flat tax proposal

283
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,302
and I accidentally proved there's no God.

284
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,472
We'll just see about that.

285
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,046
Uh-oh. Well, maybe he made a mistake.

286
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,427
Nope, it's airtight.

287
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,015
Can't let this little doozy get out.

288
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:18,154
(whistling "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing")

289
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,652
Welcome to the third lecture in our series

290
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,985
on "not putting things up your nose."

291
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,243
Please welcome Homer Simpson.

292
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,333
(sparse applause)

293
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,619
I am here to give hope to the least of you

294
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,293
because we all have a crayon up our nose.

295
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,752
Maybe it's not a crayon made of wax.

296
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,553
-Maybe it's a crayon made of prejudice.
-Question.

297
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,838
-Yes, Nelson.
-A moron says what?

298
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,512
Not being a moron, I wouldn't know.

299
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,471
However... (mumbling)

300
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,641
-What?
-Ladies and gentlemen,

301
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,060
I give you your moron.

302
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,219
-(groans)
-(jeering laughter)

303
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,728
You see, it's cool to be smart.

304
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,808
So be like me, and use your minds.

305
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,688
Paint a painting, sing a song,

306
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,364
and dance a dance.

307
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,743
(cheering)

308
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,200
Thank you. Unfortunately,
due to budget cuts,

309
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,331
we are canceling art, music and dance.

310
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,738
Please evacuate the auditorium

311
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,906
before it's bulldozed into a mini-mall.

312
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,745
-(rumbling)
-(screaming)

313
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,166
So... is that your usual coffee mug?

314
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,724
-Yup.
-Huh. Looks a little bigger.

315
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,588
-It's not.
-(Homer humming)

316
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,684
Whatcha mailing, Homer?

317
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,103
I've compiled a thorough
safety report on this plant.

318
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,063
How come you're not
giving it to Mr. Burns?

319
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,853
I've decided to disintermediate
the local authorities

320
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,938
and send it straight to
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

321
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,944
Yeah, and just in time.

322
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,856
Every day there's more skin on my pillow.

323
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,278
Yeah, it's nice to have
someone with brains

324
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,865
in this nuclear plant.

325
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,740
Homer's the guy who rigged up my pants

326
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,446
with this special codpiece.

327
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,536
-Comfy, isn't it?
-Oh, yeah.

328
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,132
It provides the freedom and protection
I so sorely need.

329
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,459
-(chuckles) Yeah!
-Yeah!

330
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,433
It seems the <i>federales</i>

331
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,220
have been tipped off
by an anonymous whistle-blower.

332
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,604
Mm-hmm.

333
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,684
Now, while the plant
is brought up to code,

334
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,937
-there will be massive layoffs.
-(all gasping)

335
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,729
That is to say, total layoffs.

336
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,983
Toodles.

337
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,024
(indistinct chatter)

338
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,358
(tires squealing)

339
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,408
(groans) Way to put us
out of work, genius.

340
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,409
I can't feed my family with a codpiece.

341
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,745
Hey, you can't hate me.

342
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,539
I'm your better.

343
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,792
Your better!

344
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,964
Ooh, you've really done it
this time, dum-dum.

345
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,134
(moans)

346
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,723
MEN (chanting): Burn! Burn! Burn!

347
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,682
Burn! Burn! Burn!

348
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,182
Effigy, eh?

349
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,184
Yeah, nothing burns like an effigy.

350
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,099
Hey, that's me.

351
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,645
Stop that.

352
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,229
The fire inspector would be appalled.

353
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,864
Don't tell me how to feel. (grunts)

354
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,855
So, you all hate me?

355
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,275
That's right, brainiac.

356
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,663
You cost us our jobs,

357
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,740
which we need for working.

358
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,655
Not to mention driving to.

359
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,044
And I was a lot happier

360
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,580
before I knew Dame Edna was a man.

361
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,794
A lot happier.

362
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,174
You ain't welcome here

363
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,090
no more, smart boy.

364
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,169
Hmm. I'm detecting a distinct strain

365
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,585
of anti-intellectualism
in this tavern-- Ah!

366
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,755
Power off, Einstein.

367
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,888
Lisa, why didn't you warn me?

368
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,443
Being a brain has alienated me
from all my friends.

369
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:45,398
Dad, as intelligence goes up,
happiness often goes down.

370
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,191
In fact, I made a graph.

371
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,818
I make a lot of graphs.

372
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,952
Well, what gets you through the day?

373
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,489
Oh, many things, tai chi, chai tea.

374
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:59,044
But I find, when I can't keep the unhappy
thoughts from swirling in my brain,

375
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,619
the best thing is
usually a nice, long walk.

376
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,915
A walk? That's a really good idea.

377
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,714
Hmm? Hmm...

378
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,510
(all laughing)

379
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,064
<i>Do you take this woman</i>

380
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,098
<i>to be your lawfully wedded wife?</i>

381
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,732
BOTH: <i>I do.</i>

382
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,479
<i>One groom...</i>

383
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,310
<i>Two grooms?</i>

384
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,605
<i>But he...</i>

385
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,938
<i>But you can't...</i>

386
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,863
<i>Oh, my medication.</i>

387
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,612
(groans)

388
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,993
<i>Radical.</i>

389
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,110
<i>Is that your final answer?</i>

390
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,827
(laughing)

391
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,198
I don't understand.

392
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,084
That wasn't funny.

393
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,661
Wait a minute.
Somebody's not laughing here.

394
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,037
-It's him.
-Hey, don't blame me.

395
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,035
This movie is tired and predictable.

396
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,547
You know she's going to
wind up marrying Richard Gere.

397
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,709
(all gasping)

398
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,377
I thought she'd wind up
with that rich snob.

399
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,796
Ably played by Bill Paxton.

400
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,385
It's Bill Pullman, you fool! Ah!

401
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,555
Point out your plot holes elsewhere.

402
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,561
Is there no place for the man

403
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,516
with the 105 IQ?

404
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,092
I'm a Spaulding Gray in a Rick Dees world.

405
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,799
Change me back to the blissful boob I was.

406
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,840
I'm sorry, we don't play God here.

407
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,933
That's ridiculous.
You do nothing but play God.

408
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,640
And I think your octoparrot would agree.

409
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,221
(squawks) Polly shouldn't be. (whistles)

410
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,267
Look, what if we gave you the name

411
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,770
of an unlicensed surgeon?

412
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,562
Oh, that would be heaven.

413
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,194
(stutters) "Moe Szyslak"?

414
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,153
MOE: <i>That's right. I'm a surgeon.</i>

415
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,526
So what do you want here?

416
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,574
Appendectomy? Lipo?

417
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,117
Or... the sampler?

418
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,371
That's very popular.

419
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,582
I want you to stick this crayon

420
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,372
into my brain.

421
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,826
No problem.

422
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,996
The ol' Crayola oblongata.

423
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,893
Ah. Now for a little powder blue.

424
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,351
Oh, no. He wouldn't.

425
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,562
All right. Tell me when I hit
the sweet spot.

426
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,404
Deeper, you pusillanimous pilsener-pusher.

427
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,940
All right, all right.

428
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:37,074
Defense! Uh! Uh! Defense! Uh! Uh!

429
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:40,162
Uh, that's pretty dumb, but, uh...

430
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,413
Extended warranty?

431
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,781
How can I lose?

432
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:44,867
Perfect.

433
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:50,368
Sweetheart, a missing crayon
could be anywhere.

434
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,208
Who wants lottery tickets?

435
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,463
OK, it's in his brain.

436
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,005
Dad, how could you?

437
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,679
We were connecting
in such a meaningful way.

438
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,218
We were what-what in a what-what?

439
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,681
(sighs)

440
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,561
Yeah, which reminds me, I need a sandwich.

441
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,564
Hey, what's this?

442
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,692
I don't know. Must be something

443
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,518
I wrote before Moe fixed me.

444
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,440
"Lisa, I'm taking the coward's way out,

445
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,355
but before I do, I just want you to know,

446
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:23,874
being smart made me appreciate
how amazing you really are."

447
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,539
-(munching loudly)
-Oh, Dad.

448
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,788
Huh?

449
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,869
Oh, you want a hug.

450
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,285
Well, that I know how to do.

451
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,553
-(grunting and chomping loudly)
-Mmm.

452
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,798
Mmm... ug.

453
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,430
(closing theme playing)

454
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,183
Shh!

455
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,602
