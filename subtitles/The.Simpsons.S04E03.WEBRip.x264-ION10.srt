00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,360
Marge, come to bed.

178
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,730
No, Homer.

179
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,317
He doesn't mean
to be sacrilegious, Lord.

180
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,863
He just likes
to sleep in on Sundays.

181
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:52,948
Marge...

182
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:56,492
come to bed, Marge.

183
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,957
Lord, he's not a bad person,
Lord, really.

184
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,408
He just sometimes...

185
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,118
It's good for what ails you.

186
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,588
He doesn't mean any harm.

187
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,799
I can wait all...

188
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,379
(snoring)

189
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,224
(rumbling)

190
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,926
Ooh!

191
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,346
(static)

192
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,780
God?

193
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:34,371
Thou hast forsaken my church!

194
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,618
Well, kind of...
but...

195
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,871
But what?

196
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,752
I'm not a bad guy.

197
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,999
I work hard
and I love my kids

198
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,001
so why should I spend
half my Sunday

199
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,173
hearing about
how I'm going to hell?

200
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,212
Hmm.

201
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,376
You've got a point there.

202
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,724
You know, sometimes

203
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,089
even I'd rather
be watching football.

204
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,966
Does St. Louis
still have a team?

205
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,014
No. They moved
to Phoenix.

206
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,467
Oh, yeah.

207
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,137
You know what I really hate
about church?

208
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,766
Those boring sermons.

209
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,403
(God sighing)
I couldn't agree more.

210
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,320
That Reverend Lovejoy
really displeases me.

211
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,820
I think I'll give him
a canker sore.

212
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,242
Give him one for me.

213
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,701
I will.

214
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,740
So I figure I should
just try to live right

215
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,825
and worship you
in my own way.

216
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,870
Homer, it's a deal.

217
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,414
Now, if you'll excuse me

218
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:27,337
I have to appear in a tortilla
in Mexico.

219
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,513
Dad, can I ask you
a question?

220
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,894
Sure, honey.

221
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,810
{\an8}Why are you dedicating
your life to blasphemy?

222
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,430
Don't worry,
sweetheart.

223
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,646
If I'm wrong,
I'll recant on my deathbed.

224
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,728
Hello, my animal friends.

225
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,274
Peace be with you.

226
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,491
Guys, please,
could you give me five minutes?

227
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,160
Reverend Lovejoy

228
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:59,118
I had an ulterior motive
in inviting you to dinner.

229
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,080
-What?!
-No, it's nothing bad.

230
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,831
I'm just concerned
because my husband

231
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,293
hasn't been attending
your services lately.

232
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,584
Well, I wasn't sure
I was doing the right thing

233
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,548
but then God himself told me
I should seek a new path.

234
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,589
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

235
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,013
He appeared before me
in a dream

236
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,431
and I knew that was special

237
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,219
'cause I usually dream
about naked-- Marge.

238
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,393
(growls)

239
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,431
So, Homer,
you saw the big cheese?

240
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,965
What did he look like?

241
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,768
Perfect teeth,
nice smell...

242
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,351
a class act
all the way.

243
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,356
Homer, you're crazy!

244
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,518
Tell him
this is all crazy.

245
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,817
Homer, I'd like you
to remember Matthew 7:26--

246
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,032
The foolish man

247
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,282
who built his house
on sand.

248
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,124
And you remember...

249
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,620
Matthew... 21:17.

250
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,004
"And he left them

251
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,960
"and went out of the city
into Bethany

252
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,210
and he lodged there"?

253
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,211
Yeah.

254
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,923
Think about it.

255
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,463
Hello, work?
This is Homer Simpson.

256
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,548
I won't be coming in tomorrow.

257
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,143
Religious holiday.

258
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,218
The, uh, feast of...

259
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,392
maximum occupancy.

260
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,931
Pretty slick.

261
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,894
You should join
my religion, Moe.

262
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:06,885
It's great.

263
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,306
No hell, no kneeling...

264
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,984
Sorry, Homer.

265
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,362
I was born a snake handler
and I'll die a snake handler.

266
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,610
(doorbell rings)

267
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,317
Neighbor,
I heard about your heresy

268
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,993
and we've made it our mission
to win you back to the flock.

269
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,333
-No sale.
-Homer, Christian life

270
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,369
isn't all praying and sacrifice.

271
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,163
Hey, dig this.

Dad, the heathen's
getting away.

282
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,521
I see him, son.

283
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,399
(bell clanging)

284
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,818

288
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,258
Where are we going?

289
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,545
Garbage island.

290
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,258
(foghorn blasts)

291
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,652

298
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,465
Let's go, kids.

299
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,675
How come we have
to go to church

300
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:10,925
and Dad gets to stay home
and watch cartoons?

301
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,056
(growls)

302
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,313
I have
a responsibility

303
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,055
to raise these
children right,

304
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,566
and unless you change

305
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,278
I'll have to tell them
their father is...

306
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,486
Well, wicked.

307
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,899
Kids, let me tell you

308
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,407
about another
so-called "wicked" guy.

309
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,619
He had long hair
and some wild ideas

310
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,991
and he didn't always do

311
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,497
what other people
thought was right

312
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,830
and that man's name was...

313
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,126
I forget.

314
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,339
But the point is...

315
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,089
I forget that too.

316
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,131
Marge, you know
who I'm talking about.

317
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,295
He used to drive
that blue car.

318
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,143
Kids, could you wait outside
for us?

319
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,097
Homer, please
don't make me choose

320
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,980
between my man and my God
because you just can't win.

321
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,268
There you go again.

322
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,941
Always taking
someone else's side.

323
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,441
Flanders,
the water department, God...

324
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,614
I'm only going to ask you
one last time.

325
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,744
Are you sure you won't
come with us to church?

326
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,952
MAN (on TV): <i>Coming up next:</i>
<i>Make your own ladder.</i>

327
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,083
Very sure.

328
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,872
LOVEJOY:
My friends

329
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,325
the devil walks among us.

330
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,246
(gasping)

331
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,875
I got him!

332
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,881
No, don't look for the pitchfork
and pointy tail.

333
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,934
Today's devil has assumed
a more seductive form

334
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,299
pleasing to the eye.

335
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,925
Oh-h-h.

336
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,432
An interview
with Lorne Michaels.

337
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,434
Oh-h-h-h.

338
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,385
Wait, that's no good.

339
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,096
Hey, now we're talking.

340
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,976
"Our unabashed dictionary
defines I.U.D.

341
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,944
as 'love springs internal.'"

342
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,185
(laughs)

343
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,396
I don't get it.

344
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,856
(doorbell rings)

345
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,406
Hello.
I'm collecting

346
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,780
for the Brotherhood
of Jewish Clowns.

347
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,197
Last year tornados
claimed the lives

348
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,076
of 75 Jewish clowns.

349
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,583
The worst incident

350
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,575
was during our convention
in Lubbock, Texas.

351
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,248
There were floppy shoes
and rainbow wigs everywhere.

352
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,628
It was terrible.
(sobbing)

353
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,256
Wait a minute.
Is this a religious thing?

354
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,684
A religious
clown thing, yes.

355
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,933
-Sorry.
-Well, bless you any--

356
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:17,274
Remember the Sabbath day
to keep it holy.

357
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,399
Apu, I see you're not in church.

358
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,730
Oh, but I am.
I have a shrine to Ganesha

359
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,936
the god of worldly wisdom,
located in the employee lounge.

360
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,857
Hey, Ganesha,
want a peanut?

361
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,776
Please do not offer my god
a peanut.

362
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,994
No offense, Apu, but when
they were handing out religions

363
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,075
you must have been out
taking a whiz.

364
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,370
Mr. Simpson,
please pay for your purchases

365
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,914
and get out, and come again.

366
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,078
Pride goeth before destruction.

367
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,707
Boy...

368
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:47,634
everyone is stupid except me.

369
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,425
(snoring)

370
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,857
(explosion)

371
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:08,645
Marge, turn down the heat.

372
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,736
That's better.

373
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,617
(snoring)

374
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,327
(sniffing)

375
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,288
(growling)

376
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,514
Ah! Fire!

377
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,767
What do I do?!
What do I do?!

378
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,059
(coughing)

379
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,602
Oh, the song, the song.

380
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,895
<i>♪ When a fire</i>
<i>starts to burn ♪</i>

381
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,609
<i>♪ There's a lesson</i>
<i>you must learn ♪</i>

382
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,899
<i>♪ Something, something,</i>
<i>then you'll see ♪</i>

383
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,283
<i>♪ You'll avoid</i>

384
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,780
D'oh!

385
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,412
(coughing)

386
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,530
(Apu gasps)

387
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,156
Fire at the old
Simpson place!

388
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,124
You're on your honor
not to steal anything.

389
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,366
Oh, we won't.

390
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,843
Little Jumpshid,

391
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,760
the store
is in your hands.

392
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:10,958
{\an8}How I have waited
for this day.

393
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,970
(siren wailing)

394
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,440
(quacking)

395
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:31,148
You ducks are really
trying my patience!

396
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,685
But you're so cute.

397
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,658
Homer! Homer!

398
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:48,093
No!

399
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,598
Dear Lord,
may your loving hand

400
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,982
guide Homer to the mattress,
square and true.

401
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,281
Okay.

402
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,492
(sirens wailing)

403
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,325
(coughing)

404
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,160
Flanders, you saved me.

405
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,706
Why?

406
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,879
Heck, you would have done
the same for me.

407
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,420
{\an8}Help! Help!

408
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,594
(laughing)

409
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,925
That's right, old friend.

410
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,179
BOTH: Dad!

411
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,680
Oh, Homie, are you all right?

412
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:43,181
Our magazines and
roach traps, gone!

413
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,885
All gone.

414
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,185
(cat yowling)

415
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,269
I saved your cat.

416
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,145
Ow! That hurt.

417
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:55,652
Hey, what
are these axes for?

418
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,906
I don't know.
Chopping stuff.

419
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,108
Gotcha!

420
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,698
(grunting)

421
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,203
Some nice chopping.

422
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,205
Truly, this was
an act of God.

423
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,213
Hey, wait a minute!

424
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,711
Flanders is
a regular Charlie Church

425
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,093
and God didn't save his house.

426
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,169
D'oh!

427
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,837
Any valuables
in the house?

428
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,177
Well, the Picasso,

429
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,182
my collection
of classic cars...

430
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,684
Sorry. This policy
only covers actual losses,

431
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,057
not made-up stuff.

432
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,813
Well, that's just great.

433
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,395
Fire-- man's oldest foe.

434
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,231
Insatiable, remorseless,
unquenchable.

435
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,487
FIREMAN:
Hey, it's out.

436
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,198
(cheering)

437
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,238
Coming up next:
Which work better--

438
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,202
springy clothespins
or the other kind?

439
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:50,504
You know, I have a feeling
there's a lesson here.

440
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,082
Yes. The lesson is--

441
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,457
No, don't tell me.
I'll get it.

442
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,964
Oh, I know.

443
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,046
The Lord is vengeful.

444
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,881
Oh, spiteful one

445
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,507
show me who to smite
and they shall be smoten.

446
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,104
Homer, God didn't
set your house on fire.

447
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,390
No, but he was working
in the hearts

448
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,694
of your friends and neighbors
when they went to your aid,

449
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,519
be they Christian, Jew, or...

450
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,064
miscellaneous.

451
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,687
Hindu.
There are 700 million of us.

452
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,025
Aw, that's super.

453
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,990
I was rude to
every one of you,

454
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,950
and you saved my life

455
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,780
when you could have
just left me to fry

456
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,485
like the proverbial pancake
that I am.

457
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:30,996
Oh, Homie, I'm so glad
to hear you say that.

458
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,081
Now, would you give church
another try?

459
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,626
I'll be there next Sunday,
front row center.

460
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,972
(snoring)

461
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,894
GOD:
Don't feel bad, Homer.

462
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,432
Nine out of ten religions
fail in their first year.

463
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,020
That's game, Hendrix.

464
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,484
God, I got to ask you
something.

465
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,525
What's the meaning
of life?

466
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,278
Homer, I can't tell you that.

467
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,030
Come on.

468
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,492
You'll find out when you die.

469
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,873
I can't wait that long.

470
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,079
You can't wait six months?

471
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,950
HOMER: No, tell me now.

472
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,287
GOD: Well, okay.

473
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,752
The meaning of life is...

474
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,504
Shh!

475
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,927
