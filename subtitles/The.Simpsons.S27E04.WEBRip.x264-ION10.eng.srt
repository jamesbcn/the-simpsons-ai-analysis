178
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,330
(crying)

179
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,010
Mm-hmm.

180
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,419
Lisa, aren't you going to wear

181
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,177
your costume to school?

182
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,009
No, I'm not doing
Halloween this year.

183
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,845
Oh, sweetie, I know you
had a scare last night,

184
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,271
but you worked so hard
on your Frida Kahlo outfit.

185
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,351
Maybe just wear
the eyebrow and mustache?

186
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,557
No.

187
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,606
No!

188
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,280
SKINNER: You kids look great.

189
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,438
Delightful.

190
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,027
No place like home.
(chuckles)

191
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,612
Hold on, Simpson.

192
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,197
Let's take a look at that
buccaneer costume.

193
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,783
No weapons, of course.

194
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,248
Bandana, possible gang wear.

195
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,368
Eye patch, offensive
to the half-blind.

196
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,866
Oh, and just to reassure

197
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,207
those who are afraid of pirates...

198
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,791
{\an8}(groans)

199
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,627
(gasps, shudders)

200
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,512

201
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,932

203

No! Leave me alone!

204
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,693
Leave me alone!

205

206
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,697
Lisa.

207

208
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,791
(shuddering)

209
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,844
Homer, I think we should
take down Everscream Terrors.

210
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,460
Wha-- W-We... we can't!

211
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,927
I'm the Mozart
of Halloween decorations,

212
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,468
and tonight is the Super Bowl.

213
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,471
Lisa's in a bad place.

214
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,473
You know how sensitive she is.

215
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,465
We don't want her
to go back to...

216
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,057
Tailee.

217
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,482
No, she wouldn't.
She couldn't.

218
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,811
Not Tailee.

219
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,896
Where is she?

220
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,358
(both gasp)

221
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,453
HOMER:
Oh. Oh.

222
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,609
Ah, let's see.

223
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,156
(gasps)

224
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,490
Oh, God.

225
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,954
We're too late.

226
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,664
The glue stick didn't hold.

227
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,788
So, Tailee's back.

228
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,334
Hmm.

229
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,627
Tailee just makes me
feel so safe.

230
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,671
I don't know why
I ever gave it up.

231
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,465
Breaks my heart that Lisa
can't deal with her emotions

232
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,880
without a crutch.

233
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,048
Well, kids are weak, Marge.

234
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,755
Oh, yeah.

235
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,307
No. No!

236
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,732
Stop it!

237
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,020
Why are you taking down
Everscream Terrors?

238
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,364
Our house has to be
a Halloween-free zone.

239
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,610
Your sister has a tummy ache
in her courage.

240
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,824
What?

241
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,033
Lisa goes nuts,
and you turn us into...

242
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,784
into skippers?!

243
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,695
{\an8}I know what this makes us.

244
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,044
{\an8}I know!

245
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,369
Honey, I knew you'd be upset,

246
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,084
and that you'd think
only of yourself.

247
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,825
So I'm taking you to the best

248
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,247
trick-or-treating block party

249
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,705
in the tri-Springfield area.

250
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,216
There's a dad who's a deejay.

251
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,469
Even an E.T.
who says your name.

252
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,551
What if I tell the E.T.
my name is a swear?

253
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,967
He'll have to say it.

254
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,215
Then I'm in.

255
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,689

256
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,403

259
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,533
Okay, sweetie,

260
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,036
just you and me spending
a regular eve together.

261
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,699
Nothing hallows about it.

262
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,207
I'm sorry
I ruined Halloween, Dad.

263
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,750
(scoffs)
Ruined?

264
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,923
Why, you just created
a new holiday...

265
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,053
Puzzle Wednesday.

266
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,880
A tabby and a calico.

267
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,886
(chuckles) I wouldn't want
to be that ribbon.

268
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,469
(doorbell rings)

269
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,064
Oh, trick-or-treaters.

270
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,969
Don't worry,
I'll get rid of them.

271
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,564
Trick or treat.

272
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,604
Porch light's off, kids.

273
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,976
Don't you know what that means?

274
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,983
We're not here for candy,
big man.

275
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,276
Hey, you're those
pop-up scuzzos.

276
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,900
What do you scuzzos want?

277
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,906
We want our jobs back.

278
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,738
Look, I don't want to be rude,

279
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:01,413
but you sad losers should
go suck somewhere else.

280
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,954
Uh, uh...

281
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,407
That? (chuckles)
Oh, that was just

282
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,038
a kindly priest here
to bless our home.

283
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,745

00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,013
(laughter)

358
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:48,553
Okay, okay, I don't think those
pop-up guys saw us come up here.

359
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,887
This isn't real, this isn't real,
this isn't real.

360
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,846
Honey, I'm your dad.

361
00:14:55,936 --> 00:15:00,266
I've lied to you more times
than there are stars in the sky.

362
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,107
But I got to be straight.

363
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,652
This is real.

364
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,316
(whimpers)

365
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,364
Okay, Halloween isn't over yet.

366
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,908
We can still squeeze in
some solid trick-or-treating.

367
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,413
(tires screeching)

368
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:15,004
Hurry, go, go, go!

369
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,420
What? What's the rush?

370
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,248
Go, go, have fun.

371
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,794
There's still time.

372
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,008
(gasps)
It's too late.

373
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,431

398
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,921
(cheering)

399
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,877
Can't hide forever,
thumb-head.

400
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,882
Sooner or later,
you're gonna have to buy

401
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,884
a Thanksgiving decoration,

402
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:52,176
and we'll be waiting
by the Indian corn.

403
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,681
(clattering)

404
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,472
Oh, no, now they're trashing
our stuff.

405
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,307
(chiming)

406
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,312
Oh, they've tangled up
my wind chimes.

407
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,354
How will I know
when the wind is blowing?

408
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,768
(groans) I hate this.
I hate feeling afraid.

409
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,818
Maybe I shouldn't
admit this to my daughter,

410
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,151
but I'm scared, too.

411
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,697
But you can't let fear
shut down your brain,

412
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:16,541
because between the two of us,
we've only got one good one.

413
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,578
I've got it.

414
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:24,631
What if... we use these
decorations to signal for help?

415
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,710
You're right.

416
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:30,715
I may not be the smartest dad
or the bravest or the smartest,

417
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,549
but I am great at one thing:
drawing attention to our home.

418
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,386
If we're gonna get out of this,

419
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,932
we're going to need
every holiday you've got.

420
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,853

422
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:49,686
Ooh, the Señor Skeletinos.

423
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,697
He must have leaned
on the "try me" button.

424
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,949
(laughs maniacally)

425
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,371
(taunting)
We're coming to get you.

426
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,870
And no fancy ceiling door
is gonna stop us.

427
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,959
(gasps)

428
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,379
MAN:
Almost got it.

429
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,630
(grunts)

430
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,171
Stuck.
(grunting)

431
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,755
They're coming-- hurry!

432
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,090
Time to wake up
the neighborhood.

433
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,512
D'oh!

434
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,474
D'oh!

435
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,306
(thugs clamoring)

436
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,150
Here we go.

437
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,559
(panting) Hurry.

438
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,227
Light the fireworks.

439
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,895
The match won't stay lit--
it's too windy.

440
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,783
I've got something
that will burn.

441
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,534
(gasps)
Are you sure?

442
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,486
Yes, this ratty
piece of polyester

443
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:43,537
has been soaking in face oil
for eight years.

444
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,292
Light him up.

445
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,172
Good-bye, Tailee.

446
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,804
(whistling and popping)

447
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,295
-(gasping)
-What the...?

448
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,717
Huh?

449
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,515
Now plug it in!

450
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,975
(people gasping)

451
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,685
Help, help!

452
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,935
Help! We're up here!

453
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,026
(muffled speech)

454
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,281
Everscream Terrors
needs our help!

455
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,783
We can get plastered
and hit on our coworkers later.

456
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:19,826
Come on!

457
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,028
Get 'em, Zardoz!

458
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,448
(gasping)

459
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,366
Sexy drunks, stop them!

460
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,374
(groaning)

461
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,792
Tragic, really.

462
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,838
For are these guys not victims, too,
in a way,

463
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,222
of our disposable pop-up culture?

464
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,010
When you get out,
look me up.

465
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,223
I know a guy who owns
a 99-cent store.

466
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,055
99-cent store?

467
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,061
Those places
are open year-round!

468
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,064
The holidays will come and go,

469
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,896
but... (sniffles) we'll stay.

470
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,741
Grown-up Halloween
seemed pretty fun.

471
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,740
I saw an areola.

472
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,742
Oh, man, this is the lamest night

473
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,584
of my entire miserable li...

474
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,199
(gasps)

475
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,412
Yes!

476
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:09,326
Everscream Terrors is back!

477
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:11,918
(Bart laughs)

478
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,672
Stop it, stop it!
This will scare Lisa!

479
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,755
Boo!

480
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,969

481
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,470

482
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,352
My brave girl.

483
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,509
(whispers)
I burned Tailee.

484
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,559
(laughs)

485
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,944
Foolish Simpsons.

486
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,900
This was not their typical
Halloween experience.

487
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,941
Wow, cool alien voice, Lenny.

488
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,736
Thanks, I've been practicing it.
As a mat...

489
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,990
(normal voice)
Oh, damn it, I lost it.
