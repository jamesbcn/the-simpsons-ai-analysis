1
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:10,810
D'oh!

2
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,530
Care to try our new sciencewater?

3
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,860
MARGE: The label is all in lower case.

4
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,903
It's like drinking e.e. Cummings.

5
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:40,440
And each of our flavors
is named after a real word!

6
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,908
Nourish.
- Mmm.

7
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:43,677
Vitality.
- Oh!

8
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,011
Purple.
- Ooh!

9
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,846
Potato Lime.
- Mmm.

10
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:48,615
I Love the '90s.
- Oh.

11
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,715
New Car Smell.

12
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,876
Excuse me.
I'm feeling a little over-hydrated.

13
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,888
That's normal.

14
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:58,124
It just means your
bladder's full of science.

15
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:02,899
Now if you'll excuse me,
our company just went bankrupt.

16
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,605
Gotta find a place to tinkle!

17
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,705
Language!

18
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,679
Schools have bathrooms.
And I'm a woman,

19
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:22,749
so my going in unattended
won't cause a panic.

20
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,295
Hey, Mrs. Simpson.
- Janey.

21
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,924
That's Bart's class.

22
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,226
Lousy teachers.

23
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,788
Lousy hangover.

24
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:42,310
This school has really gone downhill.

25
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,564
That's an awfully crowded classroom.

26
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,247
Three, two, one.

27
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,816
Okay, children,
I've just been granted tenure,

28
00:01:56,916 --> 00:02:01,336
so I'm gonna sit back
and let Ralph teach for awhile.

29
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,636
Class, in what year was one plus one?

30
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,248
The answer is the Amazing Ralph!

31
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:16,236
The only person getting
an education here today was me,

32
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,871
in how bad it is!

33
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,507
Mrs. Simpson, let me pour you a drink.

34
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,309
Scotch? Vodka? Gin?
I got everything you want.

35
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,879
I want my kids in a decent school!

36
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,715
Hey, I want the 'check engine'
light on my dashboard to shut off,

37
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,195
but that ain't gonna happen.

38
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,752
Aah!

39
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:36,489
And because of cutbacks,
they were combining math with P.E.

40
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,291
They were playing dodgebook!

41
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,728
Look at this.
Springfield Elementary's rating is so low,

42
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,098
it's more than two standard deviations
below the norm!

43
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:49,135
I can't understand that math reference
because I went to Springfield Elementary!

44
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:53,740
My cousin goes to a much better school.
He lives in Waverly Hills.

45
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,842
Their school system's the best!

46
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:59,145
Their auditorium and their gym
are two different rooms.

47
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:04,451
We can't afford to move to Waverly Hills.
Their house prices have commas in them.

48
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:08,546
As it is, our lawn
is just green-painted cement.

49
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:14,561
I just wish I could go
to a school like that even for one week.

50
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,364
'Tis better to have learned and lost
than never to have learned at all.

51
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:22,035
What if we got a small apartment there?
We wouldn't have to live in it,

52
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,704
but we would
have a Waverly Hills address.

53
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,306
Mom, that's brilliant!

54
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,342
We could go to a school
where special doesn't always mean bad...

55
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,812
...and where the teachers
don't have to moonlight as telemarketers.

56
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,949
As you know,
the music of Air Supply is timeless.

57
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,918
And now their 50 biggest hits
are on four CDs.

58
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,688
Wait, wait, wait.
You're putting us in a new school?

59
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,788
What about my friends?

60
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:47,694
Oh! Elementary school friends,
those are forever!

61
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:51,534
You're always
gonna be friends with Milhouse!

62
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:55,564
Stand by me Oh, stand by me

63
00:03:55,668 --> 00:04:01,129
Oh, stand now, stand by me Stand by me

64
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,044
I need to rent an apartment
in the worst part of Waverly Hills,

65
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,513
the crappier the better.

66
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:10,413
So cheap, eh?
- Ahso sheepay to you.

67
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:17,359
I can't afford this place.
It's way too fancy.

68
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,593
Sometimes there's not a train going by.

69
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,495
Four walls?

70
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:26,845
I was thinking
more of something in a two or three.

71
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,338
No windows, no parking
and a man died here.

72
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,241
Play it cool, Homer.
Don't let her know it's perfect.

73
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,341
Yeah...

74
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:41,047
Well, I'm looking
at a lot of murder sites right now.

75
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:43,952
Where's the bedroom?
- Right here.

76
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,287
Tempting, tempting.
Where's the bathroom?

77
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,788
In the Ethiopian restaurant...

78
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,790
...at the end of the block.
- I'll take it!

79
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,229
Waverly Hills

80
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,095
That's where I want to be!

81
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,395
Gimme gimme Gimme gimme

82
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,971
Squatting in Waverly Hills

83
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,233
Waverly Hills

84
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:11,367
Get education fraudulently

85
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,638
Gimme gimme Gimme gimme

86
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,374
Mooching off Waverly Hills

87
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,055
Well, welcome to Waverly Hills.

88
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,390
Your children can
start school immediately.

89
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,725
Thank you.
- Now,

90
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,362
you'll be getting a random visit
from the inspector sometime this month.

91
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,631
The what?
- It's just a formality...

92
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,733
...to make sure you actually live here.

93
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,971
Some people use the address
just so their kids can go to our schools.

94
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:41,808
I can see them now with their
bald heads and their blue-haired wives!

95
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,908
How I despise them.

96
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,055
Yeah. Well, here's our inspector now.

97
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,975
Call it, friendo.

98
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:56,155
Heads! I mean, tails! I mean, on its side!

99
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,846
Well done.
Now let me validate your parking.

100
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,963
That's not enough.

101
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,132
Thank you.
- Oh!

102
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,003
Goodnight, Marge.

103
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:17,744
It's so kind of you to live there
so our kids can go to a better school.

104
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,746
When do I get to move back home?

105
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,281
You just have to stay there...

106
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,978
...until that psychopathic
school inspector...

107
00:06:24,078 --> 00:06:25,351
...makes a surprise visit.

108
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,186
You can come home when the heat's off.

109
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:30,556
The heat is off.
The hissing from the radiator is a snake.

110
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:35,728
Please just stay there
till Bart graduates high school.

111
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,422
That's another 20 or 30 years!

112
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,507
Where am I?

113
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,414
Wow! Your first day at the new school.

114
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,894
Lisa, have fun. Bart, don't.

115
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,023
Look at this place.
It's everything I've ever dreamed of.

116
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,123
On campus stables!

117
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,363
Field trips to Europe!

118
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:18,398
Oh, my God.
Look what they serve in the cafeteria.

119
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,109
Welcome.
I'm your new principal, Dr. Bettelheim.

120
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,209
Ooh! A doctorate!

121
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,313
Wait! Don't matriculate those students!

122
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:28,581
Principal Skinner?

123
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,817
We need Lisa Simpson
at Springfield Elementary.

124
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:35,254
She's our top student and she writes the
fun facts in the morning announcements.

125
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,023
Skinner!

126
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,191
Bettelheim.

127
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,928
Superintendent Chalmers!
What are you doing at another school?

128
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:46,766
Seymour, as superintendent,
I supervise every school in the district.

129
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,063
So, you're overseeing other people?

130
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,539
I'm sorry if you
misunderstood our arrangement.

131
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,441
What am I supposed to tell our children?

132
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:59,196
They already know.
And they're happy for me.

133
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,786
Hey, neighbor. Welcome to the jungle,

134
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,422
also known as,
'Royal Waverly Apartments.'

135
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,391
Brought you a housewarming present.

136
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,763
That was great!
You mind if I use that at work?

137
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:19,365
It's yours, my friend.
- Hey, are you into poker?

138
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,801
Well, I love to play,
but I'm not very good.

139
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:25,872
Also, I always forget
to cash my chips back in for money.

140
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,741
This man crush just got bromantic.

141
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,443
You make words into dudes!

142
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,543
Guy five!
- Yeah!

143
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,951
Hi, newbie. I'm Caitlin with a 'C.'

144
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,088
This is Kaitlyn with a 'K.'
And this is Kate Lynn, two words.

145
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,418
I'm Lisa, one word.

146
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,527
So, Lisa, what's your favorite
Alaska Nebraska song?

147
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,128
Mine's Touch a Star.

148
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,098
Mine's Make It Yours: The Star Song.

149
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,699
Who's Alaska Nebraska?

150
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,892
Who's Alaska Nebraska?

151
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,872
Only the greatest 16-year-old
singer /actress in the world!

152
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,074
Do you even know how lame you are?

153
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,677
I should warn you.
By using the term 'lame,'

154
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,547
you're violating
the Americans with Disabilities Act.

155
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,197
Ew! That makes you even lamer!

156
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,386
B-plus?
- Nice work.

157
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,027
But I always get A's!

158
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:25,398
At my old school, I got so many A's,
the teachers didn't even check my work!

159
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,267
Maybe that's why you got so many A's.

160
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:34,572
Oh, my God. You've been challenged.
Well, Lisa, let's see how you respond.

161
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:44,383
Bart, at this school,
I'm not a brain, I'm not popular,

162
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:45,651
I'm not anything!

163
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,221
Not to worry.
At this school, we've got a clean slate.

164
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,157
In fact, I'm establishing
my cred right now.

165
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,358
CLANCY: Got you!

166
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,428
Hey!
- Come on!

167
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:59,499
Take this as a warning, kids.
Bart Simpson is the ultimate bad boy.

168
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,134
Befriend him
and you'll wind up just like him,

169
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,271
a rebel who does
what he wants when he wants.

170
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:08,534
Wow. Come on, tough guy. Let's go.

171
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,009
GIRL: He's so bad!

172
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,586
Okay, I held up my side of the bargain.

173
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:23,623
Now you have to go to Ralphie's
birthday party.

174
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,893
A deal's a deal.
- And you'll stay till we cut the cake.

175
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,828
Fine. I want one gift bag now,

176
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:33,093
and one when the party's over.
- Fine, you got it.

177
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,936
BIG TONY: You wanted a powwow, Chief?

178
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,338
I know you been dealing drugs
at the high school.

179
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,642
But I'll look the other way
if you come to Ralphie's party.

180
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,344
I ain't gonna pin no tail on no donkey!

181
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,513
Look, just come to the party.
It's gonna be fun.

182
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:48,981
Batman's gonna be there!

183
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,483
Batman?

184
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,898
I ain't messing with no caped crusader.

185
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,825
ALL: Wow.

186
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,327
I wonder what he did?

187
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:05,665
I heard he burned down his old school.
- I heard he killed a groundskeeper.

188
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,060
Oh, my. That's a bit rough.

189
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,708
Now to turn my sis from loser
to schmoozer.

190
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,281
Qué pasa, ladies?

191
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,384
You're that bad boy.
- What do you want from us, bad boy?

192
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:30,222
Don't tell anyone but my sister Lisa
is best friends with Alaska Nebraska.

193
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,557
Get out of here!
- No way!

194
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:32,658
You so lie!

195
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,161
She didn't even know
who Alaska Nebraska was.

196
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,564
Duh! She said that
because she respects Alaska's privacy,

197
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:43,002
just as I have no doubt
you guys will respect Lisa's privacy.

198
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,048
We're approaching
bandwidth overload, sir.

199
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,950
It's gossip at Waverly Elementary.

200
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,685
How juicy is it?
- The juiciest!

201
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,557
Hi, Lisa.
- Hi, Caitlin.

202
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,860
She knows my name!
- No, she knows my name!

203
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,562
Bart, your plan worked.

204
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:14,066
My plan was to lie, lie like hell,
and that's what I did.

205
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,201
Well, well.

206
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,404
It seems like someone
forgot about a previous engagement...

207
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:22,074
...at the bowling alley from 2:00 to 4:30!

208
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,454
Get him and string him up!

209
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,051
'You have the right to be delighted.

210
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,996
'If you do not have a gift,
one will be provided for you.'

211
00:13:12,588 --> 00:13:14,090
HOMER: It's open.

212
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,959
Marge, I'm glad you came!
There's a kegger down the hall.

213
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:20,799
We can go as soon
as I desecrate this corpse.

214
00:13:21,164 --> 00:13:23,366
I'm sorry, Marge. Where are my manners?

215
00:13:23,466 --> 00:13:27,136
Did you want to taunt my kill, also?
Press the X button.

216
00:13:27,236 --> 00:13:29,236
I'm doing it!

217
00:13:35,244 --> 00:13:37,454
I'll get us some brewskis.

218
00:13:37,914 --> 00:13:42,785
Cup, m'lady? Or would you
care to funnel it down thy throat?

219
00:13:42,885 --> 00:13:44,253
Definitely a cup.

220
00:13:44,353 --> 00:13:46,648
Foam wasn't spilt in a day.

221
00:13:47,023 --> 00:13:49,892
Dude, your date is hot.
- Does she have a sister?

222
00:13:49,992 --> 00:13:51,828
Two, actually. Twins.

223
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:53,928
Twins!

224
00:13:54,497 --> 00:13:58,747
I was an astronaut for a little bit.
So many rules.

225
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:05,439
Your hair smells nice.

226
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:11,972
Listen. I got a place down the hall.
- Let's go.

227
00:14:14,784 --> 00:14:19,016
So were you two in the same accident
or what?

228
00:14:22,692 --> 00:14:26,028
We don't need a bed.
We're not gonna be sleeping.

229
00:14:26,128 --> 00:14:28,128
Woo-hoo!

230
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:33,169
We're not the only ones
having a good time.

231
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:36,159
What in God's name was I thinking?

232
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,008
Maybe you could over again.

233
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:41,811
I'll cook you
my special microwave burritos.

234
00:14:41,911 --> 00:14:43,091
I stop the oven...

235
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:46,215
...when the middle is
still a little bit frozen.

236
00:14:46,315 --> 00:14:51,378
You know what a girl likes, mister.
So can I see you again?

237
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:55,480
How about you, me
and my wife have a two-way?

238
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,795
Hi.

239
00:14:59,895 --> 00:15:02,331
Lisa, I re-graded your paper
from the other day...

240
00:15:02,431 --> 00:15:04,467
...and you got an A.
- Really?

241
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:06,602
My kid's a huge Alaska Nebraska fan.

242
00:15:06,702 --> 00:15:09,372
If she could somehow get
an autographed photo or t-shirt,

243
00:15:09,472 --> 00:15:11,852
that would be A+ in my book.

244
00:15:12,341 --> 00:15:14,210
Did you just wink at me?

245
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,412
Oh, look.
There are pumpkin stickers on the floor.

246
00:15:16,512 --> 00:15:18,514
They must have fallen off
your homework for next week,

247
00:15:18,614 --> 00:15:21,334
which you don't have to hand in.

248
00:15:23,352 --> 00:15:27,256
I didn't think I'd get
a fresh start like this till junior high.

249
00:15:32,295 --> 00:15:35,464
Even the Ralph of this school
speaks French.

250
00:15:40,603 --> 00:15:42,138
I love tapas.

251
00:15:42,238 --> 00:15:46,142
It's like appetizers for a meal
that never comes.

252
00:15:46,242 --> 00:15:48,611
Try the flan de leche de cabra.

253
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:51,601
Be sure to dig around in the gunk.

254
00:15:54,116 --> 00:15:55,818
Homie!

255
00:15:55,918 --> 00:15:58,443
A key to your apartment.

256
00:16:00,323 --> 00:16:02,491
And I've got a present for you.

257
00:16:02,591 --> 00:16:06,362
But you'll have to wait
till we're back at the apartment.

258
00:16:06,462 --> 00:16:09,398
Why can't I have it now?
You got your present here.

259
00:16:09,498 --> 00:16:12,048
Basic fairness dictates... Oh!

260
00:16:14,203 --> 00:16:17,373
Caitlin, hi.
Do a reading at your bat mitzvah?

261
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:23,012
Now my bat mitzvah means something.
By the way, I was wondering.

262
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:25,381
There's this Alaska Nebraska concert
this weekend,

263
00:16:25,481 --> 00:16:27,483
and the tickets are all sold out.

264
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:28,818
Well, if it's sold out,

265
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:32,688
even Alaska Nebraska's best friend
couldn't do anything about that.

266
00:16:33,856 --> 00:16:35,424
Can't build more seats.

267
00:16:35,524 --> 00:16:37,989
Then get us backstage passes.

268
00:16:39,995 --> 00:16:41,995
Surprise!

269
00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:43,699
I redecorated!

270
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:46,569
Where are my video games, my X-Box?
My Wii?

271
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:51,741
You don't need a Wii now that I'm here,
because you and me make us.

272
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:54,343
You know, you're starting
to remind me a lot of my first wife.

273
00:16:54,443 --> 00:16:57,046
We can talk about that
after brunch with my mother.

274
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:02,518
Miss Nebraska,

275
00:17:02,618 --> 00:17:07,038
your purified water
and fried chicken skins are here.

276
00:17:10,226 --> 00:17:13,195
I am so tired of fans in my food.

277
00:17:13,763 --> 00:17:17,933
Alaska, we've never met,
but everyone thinks I'm your best friend.

278
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:19,468
Wait, wait. Let me guess.

279
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:23,839
I'm supposed to give all your best friends
front row seats and backstage passes.

280
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:26,442
Could you?
- First, riddle me this.

281
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:28,878
What's your favorite episode of my show?

282
00:17:28,978 --> 00:17:30,978
You have a show?

283
00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:37,386
Look, can you please, please help a poor
little girl who was just trying to fit in?

284
00:17:37,486 --> 00:17:39,889
It's what half your songs are about.

285
00:17:39,989 --> 00:17:40,989
You know what?

286
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:43,492
I was a little girl who
didn't fit in, either.

287
00:17:43,592 --> 00:17:46,862
So you know what I did?
I got a new nose, I got famous,

288
00:17:46,962 --> 00:17:49,732
and now I date the starting point guard
for the L.A. Clippers.

289
00:17:49,832 --> 00:17:53,402
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go meditate and smoke.

290
00:17:55,805 --> 00:17:57,373
Wait. I want to ask you something.

291
00:17:57,473 --> 00:17:59,909
Could you tell I lip-synched
that whole speech?

292
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:01,009
You know what?

293
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:03,512
I was a little girl who
didn't fit in, either.

294
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:06,315
So you know what I did? I got a new nose.
I...

295
00:18:06,415 --> 00:18:07,616
That's amazing.

296
00:18:07,716 --> 00:18:09,251
I know. Security.

297
00:18:09,351 --> 00:18:12,321
You know, I think
those shirts should say 'Insecurity.'

298
00:18:12,421 --> 00:18:14,890
Because if you feel you have
to put what you are on your shirt,

299
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,559
then I feel sorry for you.

300
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:19,719
Do you feel sorry for me? Guess not.

301
00:18:23,532 --> 00:18:26,369
Where have you been?
We have mirrors to hang!

302
00:18:26,469 --> 00:18:29,472
I went to a movie.
- Without me? How'd you get there?

303
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:31,572
I drove.
- Without me?

304
00:18:32,074 --> 00:18:34,043
Sometimes I think
this 50-square-foot apartment...

305
00:18:34,143 --> 00:18:35,711
...isn't big enough for the both of us!

306
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:38,616
Fine! You can have your key back!

307
00:18:39,381 --> 00:18:41,576
I got it halfway.

308
00:18:42,051 --> 00:18:43,285
It went back.

309
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:48,889
City inspector.

310
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:56,109
I'm here to verify that this is
the residence of Bart and Lisa Simpson.

311
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,875
D'oh!

312
00:19:09,612 --> 00:19:11,705
Hello, friendos.

313
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:17,820
Here comes Lisa
with our backstage passes.

314
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,355
Yay!
- Yay!

315
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:21,557
People, I'm not who you think I am.

316
00:19:21,657 --> 00:19:24,827
I'm just a transfer student
who wanted to make some friends.

317
00:19:24,927 --> 00:19:28,264
Yes, I lied to you.
But you only liked me because of a lie.

318
00:19:28,364 --> 00:19:29,532
So if you think about it...

319
00:19:29,632 --> 00:19:31,632
Get the liar!

320
00:19:40,743 --> 00:19:42,478
Those are last year's shoes!

321
00:19:42,578 --> 00:19:44,547
Kill her!
- Also, it's Lisa!

322
00:19:44,647 --> 00:19:46,647
Kill her twice!

323
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:49,977
Go, Dog. Go with pages missing.

324
00:19:51,086 --> 00:19:53,756
Lego spaceship, poorly assembled.

325
00:19:53,856 --> 00:19:58,027
Clearly this is the home
of elementary school children. Too bad.

326
00:19:58,127 --> 00:20:01,997
I was looking forward to killing you
and making it look like a suicide.

327
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:04,097
Thank you, friendo.

328
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,936
I am not your friendo.
- But I thought...

329
00:20:07,036 --> 00:20:09,036
You said...

330
00:20:09,471 --> 00:20:13,409
Mom! Dad! I have to leave Waverly Hills
and never come back!

331
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:14,477
I gotta get back, too!

332
00:20:14,577 --> 00:20:16,846
I just remembered I was playing
hide and seek with Milhouse.

333
00:20:16,946 --> 00:20:20,583
Three weeks?
This has gotta be some kind of record!

334
00:20:20,683 --> 00:20:22,551
I can't leave my bachelor pad.

335
00:20:22,651 --> 00:20:24,987
My bros will miss me.
- No, we won't.

336
00:20:25,087 --> 00:20:27,556
Your comments
when we watch movies aren't funny.

337
00:20:27,656 --> 00:20:30,726
Why do you watch comedies
if you don't want to hear more jokes?

338
00:20:30,826 --> 00:20:35,965
Please. I just want to go back to a place
where I'm ostracized for being me,

339
00:20:36,065 --> 00:20:38,000
not for who I pretend to be.

340
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,303
What do you think, Marge? Maybe we've
outgrown our first apartment.

Yeah. A house in the suburbs
does sound pretty nice right now,

miss our little love nest.
