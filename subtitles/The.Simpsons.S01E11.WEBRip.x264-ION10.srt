Hi, little fella.

I got some nice

Jeez, Louise.
Look at this mess.

Homer, what happened?

24
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:38,237
The boy.
Bring me the boy.

25
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,834
Bart, if you had
cleaned up your room

26
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,329
when I asked you to,

27
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,751
your father's trick back
would still be aligned.

28
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,620
So, you'll pick up
this mess right now.

29
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,088
Clumsy Homer.

30
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,209
Everything's always my fault.

31
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,837
If he'd just watch out
where he was going.

32
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,474
Hello.
What have we here?

33
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,802
A cherry bomb.

34
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,218
I thought I blew
all you guys up.

35
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,056
People, people, no rough-housing
on the monkey bars.

36
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,555
You there.
Tuck in your shirt.

37
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,266
Watch it. I saw that.

38
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:14,316
You certainly have done
awfully well for yourself, Spanky.

39
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,742
Mother, please don't call me Spanky
on school grounds.

40
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,492
Wow! A cherry bomb!

41
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,164
What are you gonna
do with it, Bart?

42
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,372
Watch out, Bart. It's Skinner!

43
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,579
Good morning,
Mr. Skinner.

44
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,575
Morning, boys.

45
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,667
Why haven't you introduced me
to any of your students, Spanky?

46
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,842
- Well?
- Mother, I would like you to meet

47
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:41,635
Milhouse, Lewis, Richard
and Bart Simpson.

48
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,351
This is the Bart Simpson
you're always talking about?

49
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:47,022
But he looks so sweet.

50
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,441
- I am, Ma'am.
- Simpson!

51
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,059
Let's move on now,
Mother, shall we?

52
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,107
Bye, Spanky.

53
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,529
So, you're gonna flush it?

54
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,741
What can I say?
I've got a weakness for the classics.

55
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,741
I think I need to make a stop
at the little girls' room.

56
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,624
Okay, Mother. This way.

57
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,075
So long, sucker.

58
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,973
Now hold it right there,
you little...

59
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,878
- Spanky?
- Mother?

60
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,887
Marge, I still hurt.

61
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,850
Marge. Marge!

62
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,221
Homer.

63
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,597
How many times do I
have to fluff your pillow?

64
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,365
Actually, I was wondering
if you could make me

65
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,645
a grilled cheese sandwich.

66
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,059
Well, okay.

67
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,997
Make sure it's squished flat
and crunchy on the outside.

68
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,944
I know how you like 'em, Homer.

69
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,566
And maybe some of those
little wieners that come in a can?

70
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,284
And some fruit cocktail
in heavy syrup.

71
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:48,619
Marge.

72
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,615
Marge.

73
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,537
Marge, get the door!

74
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,257
Principal Skinner!

75
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,340
Hello, Mrs. Simpson.
I'm afraid there's been

76
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,986
a very disturbing incident
at school today.

77
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,051
I'm outta here, man.

78
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,266
Homer, Principal Skinner is here.

79
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,558
Hello, Principal Skinner.

80
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,042
I'd get up, but the boy
crippled me.

81
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,980
I understand completely.

82
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,082
The disturbing incident I was referring to
happened this morning

83
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,146
when your son flushed
an explosive device

84
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,073
down the boys' lavatory.

85
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,572
- That ol' gag.
- Unfortunately, at the same moment,

86
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,324
my mother was in the girls' lavatory

87
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,566
making use of the facilities.

88
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,777
- Dear.
- Mr. and Mrs. Simpson,

89
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,908
we have transcended incorrigible.

90
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,785
I don't think suspension
or expulsion will do the trick.

91
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:35,213
I think it behooves us all
to consider... deportation.

92
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,793
Deportation?

93
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,758
You mean kick Bart
out of the country?

94
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,468
Hear him out, Marge.

95
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:44,008
Well, perhaps I was being a tad glib.
Let me explain.

96
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,723
Our elementary school
participates in

97
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,433
a foreign exchange program.

98
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,473
Normally, a student
is selected on

99
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,637
the basis of academic
excellence or intelligence,

100
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,436
but in Bart's case,

101
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,269
I'm prepared to make
a big exception.

102
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,855
And if you're willing
to play along,

103
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,479
he can spend
the next three months

104
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,816
studying far, far away.

105
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,672
Sounds great. Although,
a kid can't learn much

106
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,195
in just three months.

107
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,570
Homer, you didn't even ask
where Bart would be going.

108
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,577
Actually, he'd be staying
in France,

109
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,039
in a lovely chateau
in the heart of the wine country.

110
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,040
But Bart doesn't speak French.

111
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,042
When he's totally immersed
in a foreign language,

112
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,354
the average child
can become fluent in weeks.

113
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,706
Yeah, but what about Bart?

114
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,844
I'm sure he'll pick up
enough to get by.

115
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,841
And, the whole thing
won't cost you a dime,

116
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,903
as long as you're willing to
take in a student of your own.

117
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,835
Wait a minute, Skinner.

118
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,847
How do we know
some principal over in France

119
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,059
isn't pulling
the same scam you are?

120
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,119
Well, for one thing,
you wouldn't be getting a French boy.

121
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,891
You'd be getting an Albanian.

122
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,146
- You mean all white with pink eyes?
- No. No, no, no.

123
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,689
A student from Albania.

124
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,902
It's a country on the Adriatic Sea.

125
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,902
Well, going to France sounds like
a fantastic opportunity,

126
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,195
but I think Bart
should have a say in this.

127
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,239
The life of a frog.

128
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,203
That's the life for me.

129
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,583
Bart, how would you like
to spend

130
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,291
the next three months
living in France?

131
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,382
France? Wow!

132
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,128
He makes me crazy
12 months a year.

133
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,211
At least you get the summer off.

134
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,186
And I get to take a plane
there, wouldn't I, Mom?

135
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,295
Yes, Bart.

136
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,433
Wow! And one back?

137
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,140
Well, Bart seems
very enthusiastic about the idea.

138
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,272
- Yes, baby!
- Way to go!

139
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,440
Bon voyage, boy.

140
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,399
Good-bye, my special...

141
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,645
My special little guy.

142
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,946
You will write us, won't you?

143
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,950
- All the time.
- What do you know about France?

144
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,952
I know I'm going,
and you're not.

145
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,954
I'm gonna miss you, son.

146
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,616
And listen, while you're seeing
all those great sights,

147
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,166
always remember that
you're representing your country.

148
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,171
I guess what I'm saying is,

149
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,193
don't mess up France
the way you messed up your room.

150
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,723
Okay, Dad.

151
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,678
Is one of you going to be
on the charter flight?

152
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,798
- Yes, sir.
- Come along.

153
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,096
- Bye. Be good.
- We'll miss you.

154
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,384
Hey, man, watch it.
Ooh!

155
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,927
Hey, man.
It's me, Bart Simpson.

156
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,394
- Okay, kid. Let's go.
- Hey!

157
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,095
♪ Every little breeze
seems to whisper Louise ♪

158
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,686
♪ Birds in the trees seem to...
Louise ♪

159
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,483

160
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,107
Ooh la la!

161
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,904
How much longer, sir?

162
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,907
This is where we're going, right?

163
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:55,119
Chateau Mah-son.

164
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,298
Eww. What a dump.

165
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,675
You know, in Albania,

166
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,851
the unit of currency
is called the lek.

167
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,520
You gotta be kiddin'. The lek.

168
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:21,269
And the national flag
is a two-headed eagle on a red field.

169
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,562
Give me the old
stars and stripes.

170
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,476
And the main export is furious
political thought.

171
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,646
Political what?

172
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,133
Trans Albanian Airlines, flight number two,

173
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,201
Tirana to Springfield,
is now arriving.

174
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,199
Welcome to your new home.

175
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,201
Escape is impossible.

176
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,993
My name is Cesar.
This is my nephew, Ugolin.

177
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,407
You may find life here
at the chateau hard,

178
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,416
but if you shut up and do
exactly what we say,

179
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,379
the time will pass more quickly.

180
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,709
- He's right, you know.
- Well, okay, sir.

181
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,304
- Adil?
- Mother?

182
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,255
Well, I guess
for the next few months,

183
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,465
yes, I will be your mother.

184
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:01,225
And this must be
Lisa and Maggie.

185
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:05,229
And you must be
my new father, Homer.

186
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,023
Affectionate
little Albanian, isn't he?

187
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,410
Hey, come on, guys.
Quit being so grabby.

188
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,455
Sorry, man. Be my guest.

189
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,956
You may find
his accent peculiar.

190
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,634
Certain aspects of his culture

191
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,762
may seem absurd,

192
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,878
perhaps even offensive.

193
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,085
But I urge you all
to give little Adil

194
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,426
the benefit of the doubt.

195
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,800
In this way,
and only in this way,

196
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,768
can we hope to better understand

197
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,558
our backward neighbors
throughout the world.

198
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,357
Thank you, Principal Skinner.

199
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,358
Thank you, fellow students.

200
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,530
Although I have only been in
your country a few days,

201
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,240
I have already found Americans

202
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,201
to be most... trusting.

203
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,911
Although, officially,
I am required to hate you,

204
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,122
I want you to know

205
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,002
I do not feel it in my heart.

206
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,251
♪♪

207
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,051
Hurry up, boy.

208
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,720
My grapes are waiting
for their water.

209
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,096
How can you defend a country

210
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,390
where 5% of the people
control 95% of the wealth?

211
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,055
I'm defending a country
where people can think,

212
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,984
and act and worship
any way they want.

213
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,443
- Can not. Can not.
- Can too. Can too!

214
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,654
Please, please, kids.
Stop fighting.

215
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,945
Maybe Lisa's right about America
being a land of opportunity,

216
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,950
and maybe Adil has a point

217
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,412
about the machinery
of capitalism

218
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,762
being oiled with the blood
of the workers.

219
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,865
Your father is right.
We should not fight.

220
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,294
Friends?

221
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,622
Well, okay.

222
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,128
Well, now that that's settled,
I'll just clear the dishes.

223
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,500
No, no, Mrs. Simpson.

224
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,416
You have been oppressed
enough for today.

225
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,045
- I will clear the dishes.
. Okay.

226
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,893
Did you see that?

227
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,599
You know, Marge, this is the way
I've always wanted it to be.

228
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,470
We've become a fully functioning
family unit.

229
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,478
We've always blamed ourselves,

230
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,310
but I guess it's pretty clear
which cylinder wasn't firing.

231
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,856
- Homer!
- Your paper-thin commitment to your children

232
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,860
sends shivers down my spine.

233
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,992
- May I be excused?
- Lisa!

234
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,489
She's just jealous.
She'll get over it.

235
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,492
And if she doesn't, we can
always exchange her.

236
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,655
- Homer!
- Just kidding.

237
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,793
Can I have something
to go with my turnip?

238
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,285
Quiet!

239
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,846
When you work like a man,
we will feed you like one.

240
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:37,128
Now go to sleep!

241
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:44,048
Hey, hey, come on.
Move it, pal.

242
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,678
You leave Maurice alone.

243
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,215
The floor is
good enough for you.

244
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,228
You go to sleep there.

245
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,030
Nice and cozy, Adil?

246
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,650
Yes. Thank you, Father.

247
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,777
Look, Adil, you can call me Dad.

248
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,784
All right, Dad.

249
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,236
Aw!
You called me Dad.

250
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,407
Dad, do you think
I could come visit you

251
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,996
at the nuclear power plant?

252
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,080
- You wanna see where I work?
- Yes, very much.

253
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,797
None of my biological kids
ever wanted to see me at work.

254
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,299
- Then I can go?
- Well, I'll have to pull a few strings

255
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,551
with the boys in security,
but sure, you bet.

256
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,005
Excellent.

257
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,005
Now watch me.

258
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,927
You grab the grape
between your thumb and forefinger,

259
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:34,187
and gently twist it off
and drop it in the bucket.

260
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,191
Now you do it.

261
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:40,153
Very good. Now do it
a million times.

262
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,986
See these?
American doughnuts.

263
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,242
Glazed, powdered
and raspberry-filled.

264
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,695
Now how's that for
freedom of choice?

265
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,287
Dad, do you think
I might see your

266
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,503
plutonium isolation module?

267
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,752
Maybe.
Hold on a second.

268
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,746
Hey, Lenny.

269
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,068
Does this place have one
of those plutonium isolation deals?

270
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,220
- Yeah, over in sector 12.
- Sector 12?

271
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,260
Third floor,
by the candy machines.

272
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,934
That sector 12.

273
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,312
Come along, Adil.

274
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,225
Ungrateful swine!

275
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,363
We give you food,
we give you shelter,

276
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,650
and this is how you repay us!

277
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,065
You little shutterbug.

278
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,040
Cheese!

279
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,042
Cheese!

280
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,044
Wait a minute.

281
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,796
Stupid grapes.

282
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,169
Bunch of creeps!
I hate France!

283
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,509
You sure have
taken a shine to little Adil.

284
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,677
Well, he sure makes life
a lot easier around here.

285
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,265
You have to admit that.

286
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,020
Well, okay, I will,
if you admit you love Bart.

287
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,613
Okay. Okay.
I love Bart.

288
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,689
- Well?
- What?

289
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,614
Well?

290
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,283
Adil's a very sweet boy.

291
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,202
Darn tootin'.

292
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:42,072
"Dear Bart, How is France?

293
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,069
"I don't know why
you haven't written.

294
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,281
I guess you're just
having too much fun."

295
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:50,452
- Yeah, right.
- Silence!

296
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,832
"Everyone here
in the United States is fine.

297
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:57,041
"We think Maggie may say
her first word any day now.

298
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,502
"Lisa got an 'A' in math,

299
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:03,173
"which I'm only mentioning as news.
I'm not putting you down.

300
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:06,883
"And your father, well...

301
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,586
"last night, he went to sleep

302
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,296
talking about how much
he loves you."

303
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,848
"Remember to dress warm,

304
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,333
"and try to be as helpful
as you can

305
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,313
"to your adopted parents.

306
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,765
All my love. Mom."

307
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,888
What are you doing?
Get out of here!

308
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,095
Sorry.

309
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:05,935
On second thought, Bart.
Bart, come here.

310
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,908
- Drink this.
- No, thanks.

311
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,330
Do not worry.
This is France.

312
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,619
It is customary
for children to take

313
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,953
a little wine now and then.

314
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,078
Yeah, but it's got
antifreeze in there.

315
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,165
Drink it!

316
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,354
Ooh!

317
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,346
Bart.

318
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,656
No.

319
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,254
You're a policeman, aren't you?

320
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,495
Excusez-moi.
Je ne parle pas Anglais.

321
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,297
But you gotta help me.

322
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,840
These two guys I'm staying with,
they work me day and night.

323
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,335
They don't feed me.
They make me sleep on the...

324
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,099
I... I don't want
a piece of candy.

325
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,812
I need your...

326
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,854
Come on, Mister.
Can you help me?

327
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,360
Forget it.

328
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,992
I'm so stupid.

329
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,160
Anybody could have learned
this dumb language by now.

330
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,490
Here I've listened to nothing
but French for the past...

331
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,977
Honey, I'm home.

332
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,857
Hello, Homer.
What's that?

333
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,855
Just some blueprints
Adil wanted.

334
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,697
I'm telling you,
he's such a curious little dickens.

335
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:23,663
I bet he could build
a nuclear power plant if he wanted to.

336
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,155
All right, Sparrow.

337
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,827
We know you're in there.

338
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,955
We'll give you one minute
to surrender.

339
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,922
My!

340
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,884
Ooh, trouble
in the neighborhood.

341
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,184
Let's check it out.

342
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,428
I'm his neighbor.
What did he do?

343
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,100
Well, sir, we...

344
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,759
Well, sir, we've
been on the trail

345
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,387
of a spy transmitting
highly confidential information

346
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,394
- to an unfriendly nation.
- Ooh!

347
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,516
Through the use
of radio triangulation,

348
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,364
we tracked him
to exactly this point.

349
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,689
Wow.

350
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,693
- That's all I can tell you.
- Aw.

351
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,875
All right. Well, the name of
his country starts with the letter "A."

352
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,823
- Ooh!
- Time's up, Sparrow.

353
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,735
We're coming in after you.

354
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,953
Gee whiz. Adil would get
a kick out of seeing this.

355
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,945
- Adil?
- The Sparrow!

356
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,421
Adil.
There you are.

357
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,710
Get him!

358
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,598
Au revoir, suckers.

359
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,698
So, he's going to prison?

360
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,160
No. We've arranged
an exchange

361
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,841
for one of our own men
caught in Albania.

362
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,788
So, Sparrow, we meet again.

363
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,160
Yes.
Sometimes I think

364
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,247
I am getting
too old for this game.

365
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,212
Okay, kids.
Let's hurry it up.

366
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,882
Good-bye, Simpsons.
Thank you for your hospitality.

367
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,382
I hope this experience

368
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:59,683
will not sour you on
the student exchange program.

369
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,635
- Good-bye, Adil.
- Have a nice trip.

370
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,771
Good-bye, Adil.

371
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,138
I'll send you those
civil defense plans you wanted.

372
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,806
Air France, flight dix-neuf
cent quatre-vingts huit,

373
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,265
Paris to Springfield
is now arriving.

374
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,823
Look, Mom.
There he is!

375
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,152
Bart, my baby boy.

376
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,987
- Welcome home.
- Hey, where's the big guy?

377
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,782
He means me.

378
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,786
- Hey, boy.
- Hey, Homer.

379
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:30,248
He brought us gifts.
His first unselfish act.

380
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,040
So, basically, I met
one nice French person.

381
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,086
Bart, I have something to say

382
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,729
that's gonna bother me
if I don't say it.

383
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,094
- It's good to see you.
- Same here.

384
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,633
I'd love a glass of that wine

385
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,387
Bart brought us.

386
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,968
Sorry, Marge. Some wise guy
stuck a cork in the bottle.

387
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:53,598
You hear that, Marge?
My boy speaks French.

388
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:01,529
♪♪

389
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,876
Shh!
