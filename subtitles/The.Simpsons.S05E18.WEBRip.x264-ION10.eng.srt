00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,801
Smithers, do you realize,
if I had died,

55
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,512
there would be no one
to carry on my legacy?

56
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,603
Due to my hectic schedule
and lethargic sperm,

57
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,969
I never fathered an heir.

58
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,056
Now I have no one

59
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,852
to leave
my enormous fortune to.

60
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,856

I propose to you that
your heir need not be a boy.

98
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,690
In this phallocentric
society of ours--

99

I don't know what "phallocentric" means,
but no girls!

That's it, boy.
You're our last hope.

102

{\an8}Ohh. I just don't want
to be here, Dad.

103
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,157
{\an8}Besides, I started a fire
this morning

104
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,542
{\an8}that I really
should keep an eye on.

105
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,209
Bart, this isn't the kind of thing
I normally would think was a good idea,

106
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,419
but you wouldn't have
to live with Mr. Burns.

107
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,749
You'd just get all
of his money someday.

108
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,754
This could provide
for your entire future.

109

-(applause)
-Congratulations.

110
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,675

for the common cold--

113
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,643
Hello, Marge. I'm Lee Majors.

114
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,975

00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,760
-It's Kurns, stupid!
-No, it's not.

are feeling

136

137
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,006
Isn't there something
you'd like to say?

138
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,092
There sure is.

139
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,257
Kids, you tried your best,
and you failed miserably.

140
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,637
The lesson is,
never try.

141
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,595
(laughing)
Right in the butt.

142
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,687
That was great.

143

(angry grumbling)

144
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,647
It's no use.

145
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,113

to leave all my money

146
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,113
to the egg advisory council.

147
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,315
Eggs have gotten quite a bad rap
lately, you know, Smithers.

148
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,866
Oh, look. A bird has
become petrified

149
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,911
and lost its sense
of direction.

150
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,705
I think it's a rock, sir.

151
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,748
We'll see what the lab
has to say about that.

Look, Smithers.

158
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,241
A creature
of pure malevolence.

159
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,661
He's the perfect one
to suckle

160
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,200

161
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,083

Why, it's Christmas day.

I was talking to him.

00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,421
-You, what day is this?
-Huh?

165
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,250
I'll tell you
what day it is.

166
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,875

you become my heir.

Whoo-hoo!
We're rich.

172
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,025
Bart, get over to the mansion
and open up all the windows.

173
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,738

00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,487
<i>(gasps, screaming)</i>

345
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,044
(laughing)

346
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,788
(laughing continues)
Funny.

347
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,129
That was delightful.

348
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,788
Did you see that?

349
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,457
That mouse butchered
that cat like a hog!

350
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,336
Is all TV this wonderful?

351
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:34,144
Um, I'd kind of like
to go home now.

352
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,009
Like a hog!

353
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,136
I-- What?
What was that?

354
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,233
Mr. Burns, I don't want
to seem ungrateful,

355
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,810
but I want to go home
to my family.

356
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,316
(sighs) I was hoping I wouldn't
have to tell you this,

357
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,359
but I'm afraid your family
doesn't want you back.

358
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,120
<i>(stilted speech)</i>
<i>I do not miss Bart at all.</i>

359
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,700
<i>(shaky voice)</i>
<i>I am glad he's gone.</i>

360
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,246
<i>-As am I.</i>
<i>-B'oh!</i>

361
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,250
It's probably
my imagination,

362
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,292
but something about them
didn't seem quite right.

363
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,916
Really? Excuse me
for just a moment.

364
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,216
People,
that was all wrong!

365
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,841
Homer Simpson doesn't say "B'oh."
He says--

366
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,257
"D'oh."

367
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,640
(British accent)
Sorry, M.B.,

368
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,436
but I'm having trouble
with this character.

369
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,730
Is he supposed to have some kind
of neurological impairment,

370
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,145
like <i>Rain Man</i>
or Awakenings?

371
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,744
I mean, what the hell
am I doing here?

372
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,410
And this dialogue has none of the wit
and sparkle of <i>Murphy Brown.</i>

373
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,490
(low voice) Hey, you know
we're getting into golden time?

374
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,076
Yes, well, just get it right,

375
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,791
or you'll all be back doing
<i>Come Blow Your Horn</i>

376
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,081
at the Westport Dinner Theater.

377
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,754
All right then.

378
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,503
Let's see what the old
Simpson family is up to now.

379
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,003
<i>Duh-oh!</i>

380
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,678
(groans)
That's them, all right.

381
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,548
I can't believe it.

382
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:02,352
I guess you're
the only one I can trust.

383
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:05,272
-Hmm? Hmm?
-Dad?

384
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,935
-(bone snaps)
-Oh! That rib always breaks.

385
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,780
(groaning)

386
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,913
Lisa, what are you doing?

387
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,870
Just trying to fill the void of random,
meaningless destruction

388
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,621
that Bart's absence
has left in our hearts.

389
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,124
(yelps)

390
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,915
That's sweet, honey.

391
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,039
It's a little tight.

392
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,376
Yes, that's to correct
your posture.

393
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,420
Soon you'll have
a mighty hump.

394
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:36,014
Now, you really
are my son.

395
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,221
This calls for a celebration.

396
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,762
Let's fire some employees.

397
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,305
Excellent.

398
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,557
Okay, let's make this
sporting, Leonard.

399
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,153
If you can tell me
why I shouldn't fire you

400
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,689
without using the letter "E,"
you can keep your job.

401
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,283
Uh, okay. Um--

402
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,070
I'm a good work guy.

403
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,355
-You're fired.
-But I didn't say--

404
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,818
You will.

405
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,738
Eeeeeeee!

406
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,077
(chortling)

407
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,752
-Let me try one.
-(switch clicks)

408
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:11,461
Mmm. Mmm. Hey, the trail
of donuts ended.

409
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,633
-(gasps) Bart!
-(gasps) Homer!

410
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,632
(gasps)
What a coincidence!

411
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,934
And a perfect opportunity
for you to prove your loyalty.

412
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:21,758
Go ahead, Bartholomew.
You may fire when ready.

413
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,305
-(groans)
-(whimpers)

414
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,975
Hurry. Fire him now or I'll disown you.
You'll lose everything.

415
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,074
The fabulous toys,
a lifetime of wealth and luxury,

416
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,360
the gift certificate
from Blockbuster Video,

417
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,954
the freedom to do
whatever you want.

418
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,910
I'll miss you, son.

419
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:46,120
I'm sorry, Dad.

420
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,413
You're fired!

421
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,456
What? Fire me?

422
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:54,539
That does it.
You can never be my son.

423
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:58,128
-A little to the left.
-Huh? Oh, very well.

424
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,585
You can never be my--

425
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,136
-Eeeeeeee!
-(gasps)

426
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,930
{\an8}Sir, try to land
on Leonard's carcass!

427
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,104
(sighs)

428
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:14,064
Son, I know you're upset because
you thought you saw us on TV

429
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,937
saying we didn't want you
in our family,

430
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,904
but those were just
actors playing us.

431
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:19,856
How do you know?

432
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,195
Because one of them hung out
with me for a week,

433
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,370
trying to get
my character down.

434
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,698
Yeah, me too. That midget
taught me a lot about his native Estonia.

435
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:30,155
The point is, the real Simpson family
missed you a lot,

436
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,707
and we're really glad
you're home.

437
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,210
(kisses)

438
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,462
-I love you guys.
-Right back at ya, son.

439
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,335
(all sighing)

440
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:42,762
And now I want you to meet your
new brother, Hans Moleman.

441
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,143
Cowabunga, dudes.

442
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,182
(kissing)

443
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,636
Give it a try.
It's like kissing a peanut.

444
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,937
(chuckling)

445
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,980
(kissing)

446
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,984
{\an8}MARGE: Homer, I want
that thing out of my house.

447
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,107
{\an8}(kissing continues)

448
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:03,033
{\an8}♪♪

449
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,066
Shh!
