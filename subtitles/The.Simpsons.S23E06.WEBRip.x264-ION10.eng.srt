Aw, I've always wanted an Aiden.

Where's the trolls?

348
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,891
The trolls are now vampires,

349
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,983
the Brooklyn Bridge
is now a castle,

350
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,059
and Fuzzlepitch is now Bloodball.

351
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,564
Oh, weak! Weak and lame!

352
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,067
How could the publishers
change our book?

353
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,979
If they had been in charge
of the Sistine Chapel,

354
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,818
the whole thing would be vampires,

355
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:49,243
instead of the pope's
private naked dude mural.

356
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,243
Look, we market-tested the book,

357
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,405
and it really got dinged
on the whole trolls thing.

358
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,834
I mean dinged.

359
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,832
So we made some changes.
Don't feel bad.

360
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,294
Before we got our hands on <i>Twilight,</i>

361
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,384
it was about a girl
who fell in love with a golem.

362
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,629
But teenagers weren't going
to spend their allowances

363
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,091

364
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,131
But the trolls were the best part!

365
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,755
Do the characters still say
trolly instead of cool?

366
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,182
-No.
-Oh, that is so untrolly!

367
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,891
Hey, if you don't want your words
changed, write a screenplay.

368
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,143
We own your book,
so why don't you go and cry

369

370

-How could they do this to our book?

371
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,766
It was the singular vision
of seven people.

372
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,187
-No way!
-What you're feeling is called

373
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,696
pride of authorship.

374
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,818
You thought you only cared
about money,

375
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,905
but you actually care more about
what you've created together.

376
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,874
British Fonzie is right.

377
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,873
Our story is actually
more important than money.

378
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:43,247
I was gonna buy the apartment
next door and fill it with dolls,

379
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,205
but now that just sounds stupid.

380
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,625
They can't do this to us.
We've got to fight back!
