1
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:07,131
The Simpsons

2
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:11,344
D'oh!

3
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,490
If you ask me,
Muhammad Ali
in his prime

4
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,076
was much better
than anti-lock brakes.

5
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,912
Yeah.
But what about Johnny Mathis
versus Diet Pepsi?

6
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,872
I cannot listen
to this again!

7
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:44,210
Guys, I just ordered
my wife the greatest
anniversary present.

8
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,586
A koi pond!

9
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,130
A koi pond?

10
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,716
Yeah. A meditative
lily pond with big,

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,884
beautiful fish that
fry up really good.

12
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,261
That's the perfect gift.

13
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:56,431
Yeah. You don't even
have to feed the fish,
'cause squirrels drown in it.

14
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,474
You got this
husband thing down, Homer.

15
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,269
Yeah. You must be
some kind of marriage
super genius.

16
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:02,687
How about a few tips?

17
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,313
Certainly, Lenford.

18
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,233
Make every day
a celebration
of your love.

19
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,360
Surprise her
with a pasta salad.

20
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:11,404
Put a mini-beret
on your wang.

21
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,364
This stuff is gold.

22
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,408
Happy marriage,
here I come.

23
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,746
This'll really help
with my speed dating.

24
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,958
I got 400 no's.

25
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,795
I can't wait to
see my surprise!

26
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,174
Hey, hey, hey!
No peeking!

27
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,385
Happy anniversary, Marge!

28
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,852
A koi pond!
It's beautiful!

29
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,898
Oh, you sweet,
wonderful man-child.

30
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,069
I finally have
a peaceful place to sit
and hear my own thoughts.

31
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:55,364
How much money
did he piss away on this?

32
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,288
What was that?

33
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,125
What the hell
is that noise?

34
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,377
That caterpillar
is screaming.

35
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:15,176
The poor thing's
in pain.

36
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:21,516
What he needs is a visit
from kindly old Doctor Foot.

37
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,936
Hold it right there,
Doctor Foot.

38
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:29,398
You're about to kill
an endangered species,
the screamapillar,

39
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,903
which has chosen
your yard as its home.

40
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,863
Fine, I won't kill it.

41
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,365
Finish the job.

42
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,994
Mr. Simpson, allowing
an endangered species to die
is a federal offense

43
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,872
under the Reversal of
Freedoms Act of 1994.

44
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,541
You are now
legally responsible

45
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:50,044
for the safety and well-being
of this screamapillar.

46
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,922
Everything you need to know
is in this pamphlet.

47
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,051
Wow. Look at
all this stuff.

48
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,846
"Without constant reassurance,
it will die.

49
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,014
"It's sexually
attracted to fire. "

50
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,559
Are you sure God doesn't
want it to be dead?

51
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,687
Hey, what's God gonna do?
Make my wife leave me again?

52
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,609
What does he want now?

53
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,445
If he wants to sleep
with us, forget it!

54
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,462
Put him down, boy!
Put him down!

55
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,929
"Once upon a time
there were three bears.

56
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,389
"The end. "

57
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,686
Oh, fine! I'll go
back to the beginning!

58
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:55,568
Oh, no!
I crushed that horrible bug!
What should I do?

59
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,864
Bury it, quickly,
before anyone finds out.

60
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,283
I'm gonna tell!

61
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,701
The hell you will!

62
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:11,500
Now we're in it together.
There's no going back.

63
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,462
Yeah!

64
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,513
Stop what you're doing!

65
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,602
Why don't I hear
any screaming?

66
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,103
He's sleeping!

67
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,439
Then why don't I hear
any sleep screams?

68
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,108
Well, the thing
about that is...

69
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,613
Woo-hoo! He's alive!

70
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,158
Now you can't punish me.

71
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,788
Homer Simpson,
for attempted insecticide
and aggravated buggery,

72
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:52,208
I sentence you to 200 hours
of community service.

73
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,754
Next case. Duffman v.
Duff Brewing Corporation.

74
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,924
Duffman's pension
has been mismanaged!

75
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,300
Oh, yeah!

76
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,135
Objection.

77
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,137
That party-hearty
attitude is a registered

78
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,098
trademark of
the Duff Corporation.

79
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,934
Whatever happened
to fair use?

80
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,397
Lousy community service!

81
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:18,025
Meals on Wheels!
Eat it up or I go to jail.

82
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,279
Didn't these meals
used to have a cobbler?

83
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,782
They discontinued
the cobbler.

84
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,076
You smell like cobbler.

85
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,246
Now let's not get into
who smells like what.

86
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,504
Come in.

87
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:56,063
Oh, I can't let you
leave now.

88
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,402
Safe and sound.

89
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,157
That's better.

90
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:12,788
Thank God I'm out of matches!
Oh, no. Here's another one.

91
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:19,253
Please don't kill me!
I won't tell anyone
about the skeleton!

92
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,547
And I could bring
you more victims!

93
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,592
Like Lenny!
He'd go great
with wild rice!

94
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:27,511
Oh, don't be such
a nervous Pervis.

95
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:31,807
That's not a real skeleton,
it's a Halloween costume.

96
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,184
But what about the ax?

97
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,102
Oh, don't be silly.

98
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,146
I just use that
to chop through

99
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,024
those tough Meals
on Wheels steaks.

100
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:46,572
Oh, I couldn't
possibly eat all this.

101
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,365
Please join me.

102
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,992
You're the shut-in.

103
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,288
So I threw
the SuperBall so hard

104
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,541
it hit the ceiling twice,
then broke a lamp!

105
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:04,048
Oh, Homer, I feel like
I'm talking to Bennett Cerf.

106
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:08,052
Yeah, I've gotten a lot of
compliments about my talking.

107
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:13,015
Before you go,
would you mind opening
this jar of butter pickles?

108
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,683
My pleasure.

109
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:24,777
Oh, my.
You're as strong
as you are handsome.

110
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,779
And I can ride
my bike real fast.

111
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,823
Aren't you a wonder?

112
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,953
Can I call you
the next time I need
a muscular he-man?

113
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,956
Hey!
I'm not running an employment
service, you old...

114
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,210
Oh, you mean me?
I'd be delighted.

115
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,965
Yello? Hi, Mrs. Bellamy.

116
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,593
No, I'm not doing anything.
I can mow your lawn.

117
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,887
Cover for me.

118
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,326
Hello? Uh-huh.

119
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,163
Yes, Mrs. Bellamy.
I'll be right there.

120
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,082
That woman is
taking advantage of you.

121
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,459
And we need you to do
things around here.

122
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:23,586
The oven light is out.

123
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,754
And you never finished
filling up the aquarium.

124
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,428
Marge, I can't say no
to a helpless old lady.

125
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,513
They put spells on you!

126
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,599
Fine. I'll go talk to her.

127
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:40,352
Homer's family
needs him, too.
And that's that!

128
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,647
Oh, Marge,
you're such a good woman

129
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,192
to care so much
about your husband.

130
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:52,323
All I have left
of my Chester is his
tattered old Army jacket.

131
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,035
Let me sew that
up for you.

132
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,204
Make sure
you double stitch.

133
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,122
Then do these socks.

134
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,835
Darn her socks?
I say darn her!

135
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,963
I'll do them and
then I'm out of here.

136
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:18,015
Did you hear that
Gertie had a terrible fall
outside the thrift store?

137
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,559
Oh! She would fall there!

138
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,565
Hey, who do I have to
gum to get a refill?

139
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,112
Freshen your drinks,
ladies?

140
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,365
Laxative?

141
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,866
Yeah.

142
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,828
Mother,
may I read a magazine
while I wait in the car?

143
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,123
Don't you read enough
at school, bookworm?

144
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,340
I am so sick of
doing her dirty work.

145
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,009
She's taking
advantage of us, Homer!

146
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,929
The Missus prefers
you call me Simpson.

147
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,432
She's got a set
of lungs on her.

148
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,937
Are you all right?

149
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,858
That man took my
diamond necklace.

150
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,864
Don't worry.
You're gonna
be just fine.

151
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,702
Okay.

152
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,581
Oh, my gosh.
She's dead!

153
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,258
So let me get this straight.

154
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,303
This mysterious man
with braces

155
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,389
just stabbed the old lady
and disappeared?

156
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,224
Without a trace.

157
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,268
Found her will, Chief.

158
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:48,397
It was just changed
to leave the Simpsons
$50,000.

159
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,066
So it's a good
thing she died,

160
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,652
from our point of view,
financially.

161
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,405
Well,
I'd like to thank you both
for cooperating with...

162
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,489
Did you do it?

163
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,784
Chief Wiggum!
Homer and I are innocent!

164
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,328
I'm sorry, Marge.

165
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,205
I can't believe
I tried to trick you
with such an...

166
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,082
Did you do it?
No!

167
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,043
Now if you'll excuse us,
we'll just be...

168
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,210
Does that ever work?

169
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,212
No. No, never does.

170
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,505
Book him, Lou.

171
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,842
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
I'll be back on the streets
by dinnertime.

172
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,302
You'll see.

173
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,348
And the elephant that
couldn't stop laughing
was put to death.

174
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,432
Speaking of death,

175
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,727
octogenarian Myrna Bellamy
was brutally murdered
last night.

176
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:30,731
The top suspects,
her disgruntled servants,
Homer and Marge Simpson.

177
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,815
Hmm?

178
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,400
Top suspects?

179
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,112
Oh, dear.
Now everyone will think
Homer and I did it.

180
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,574
The real killer is
the man with the braces.

181
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,285
Yeah.
If Dad killed everyone
he talked about killing,

182
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,828
would any of us be here?

183
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,164
You'd be dead
a million times.

184
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,710
Do you really think
Homer could be a killer?

185
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:55,130
I just can't believe
a man we sat and drank
with all these years

186
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,840
could do such
a horrible thing.

187
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,551
Well, we've all got
that voice in our heads
telling us to kill.

188
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,595
You just have
to drown it out.

189
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,057
I've been
working on the railroad
all the livelong day

190
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,392
Yeah, that's better.

191
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,645
Oh, man. What a day!
I'd kill for a beer.

192
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,650
Right away, sir.
I don't want no trouble.

193
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,403
Mmm.

194
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,155
I'd stab somebody
for a pickle.

195
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,118
Give me some peanuts.

196
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,662
You didn't say
you'd kill me.

197
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,498
I'll kill you if you don't
give me some peanuts.

198
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,083
Here you go, mister.

199
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:39,299
Today's readings
come from Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John.

200
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,137
Well, maybe just
Matthew and Mark.

201
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,348
Amen!

202
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,064
Next on the
Springfield Death Tour

203
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,067
is the home of Marge
and Homer Simpson,

204
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:00,654
also known as "H-Diddy
and his Murder Ho. "

205
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,198
Go away!

206
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:08,036
Wait, wait!
That's a suggestion,
not a threat.

207
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,541
Homer!

208
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,918
What? It goes
right by our house.

209
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:21,800
This is ridiculous.

210
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,927
You've been through
my delicates, my silkies,

211
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,805
my dainties,
and my unmentionables!

212
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,309
I insist on
searching every inch
of this home personally.

213
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,478
Here's my underwear drawer.

214
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:33,770
Where's that robot?

215
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,522
Hey, Chief.
You better get in here.

216
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,028
Mrs. Bellamy's necklace!

217
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,571
Homer and Marge Simpson,

218
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,824
you're under arrest for
the murder of Myrna Bellamy.

219
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,077
Homer,
what are we going to do?

220
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,538
You know, Chief,
if you let us go,

221
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:54,082
there's a diamond
necklace in it for you.

222
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,751
I hope you're
not suggesting

223
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,462
that I would take that
necklace as a bribe.

224
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,214
Think again, dirtbag.

225
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,425
Because I can
just swipe it later
from the evidence locker!

226
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,681
Yeah, your wife's gonna look
pretty good in that, Chief.

227
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,767
Yeah. She's a super lady.

228
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,986
I can't believe
we've been arrested
for murder.

229
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:24,279
Don't worry, Marge.

230
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,533
I'll cut us
a deal by becoming
a jailhouse snitch.

231
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,035
I know who
stopped up the toilet.

232
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:37,209
Now don't worry, kids.
You'll be placed with
a caring foster family.

233
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,837
Young'uns, meet your new
brother and sister.

234
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,383
They's worth five dollars
a day county money.

235
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,593
I'm Bart.
And this is Lisa.

236
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,387
Them's city names.

237
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:54,059
From now on,
you're Dingus Squatford Jr.
and Pamela E. Lee.

238
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,852
But I like my old name.

239
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,271
You hush up, Dingus!

240
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,358
They hated the victim.

241
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,403
Her death earned
them $50,000.

242
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,364
And the necklace was
found in their home.

243
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,241
Does the defense have
any closing remarks?

244
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,368
Well, not at this time,
Your Honor.

245
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,452
This is the only time.

246
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,329
Well, then no.

247
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,254
Mr. Foreman,
have you reached
a verdict?

248
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,340
Verdict? Is that what
we were supposed to do?

249
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,093
Well, in all my
years on the bench...

250
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,220
'Cause that's what we did!

251
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,224
You juries.
Gonna be the...

252
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,892
How do you find?

253
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,606
We find
the defendants guilty.

254
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,109
Homer and Marge Simpson,

255
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:48,030
I sentence you to death
in the electric chair!

256
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:53,827
But we're innocent!
It was the man
with the braces!

257
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,873
Can't you do anything?
Surprise witnesses?
Evidence tampering?

258
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,876
Play the race card!
Play it!

259
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:10,093
We appreciate your
coming to comfort us.
But we're not Catholic.

260
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,637
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

261
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,723
Well, then I hope you enjoy
your stay in hell.

262
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,061
Nice dress.

263
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,688
Oh, go home and have
sex with your wife!

264
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,732
That's it. Bring it on!

265
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,525
Why you little...

266
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,447
Come on, you sainted...

267
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:42,084
How can you have
such an appetite
at a time like this?

268
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:46,505
Let's just say
I'm planning a little
surprise for the execution.

269
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,175
This cannon is gonna
be full when I go off.

270
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,593
Ka-boom!

271
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,680
You know,
this is our last night

272
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,724
and our cells
are side by side.

273
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,519
It's hard to get
in the mood

274
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,605
with all those
murderous eyes
staring at us.

275
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,525
Just think of them
as twinkling stars.

276
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,695
Homie, I'm sorry.
I can't.

277
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,699
I just keep thinking about
everything we're gonna miss.

278
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:18,203
The kids growing up.
Grandchildren.

279
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:25,711
I want to confess.
I killed and robbed
the old lady all by myself.

280
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,713
Marge is completely innocent.

281
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,716
The only thing
she's guilty of
is loving too much.

282
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,467
The murder I did.

283
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,515
Congratulations,
Mrs. Simpson.

284
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,102
Your husband
confessed to everything.
You're free to go.

285
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:46,940
Oh, my love.
You saved my life.

286
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,317
Now you do it for me.

287
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,786
Dead man walking
on the green mile!

288
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,669
Give me your hands, boss.

289
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,422
I'll kill you!

290
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,759
I killed them other people,
and I'll kill you, too!

291
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:17,429
You want some cornbread,
Mr. Jingles?

292
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,098
Well, you can forget it.

293
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,725
Because I'm gonna kill you!

294
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,119
Hello?

295
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,079
Yes, Governor!

296
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,082
No, Governor.
It's not too late.

297
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,211
Yes, Governor.
I'll tell him right away.

298
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:53,298
The governor says he hopes
you're a twitcher!

299
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,925
Oh, yes!

300
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,135
Oh.
Chin up, Homer.

301
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,222
We've gotta put
an electrode there
to ground the brain stem.

302
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,681
Thank you.

303
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,438
Goodbye, Marge.

304
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:11,149
I'll always love you.

305
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,155
You're on Frame Up!

306
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:19,991
That's right.

307
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,993
Homer Simpson,
you're the latest victim

308
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,830
of the new reality show,
Frame Up!

309
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,041
It's the man
with the braces!

310
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,920
I'm also your host.
Now let's meet a ghost.

311
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,340
Mrs. Bellamy?

312
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,093
There never was
a Mrs. Bellamy.

313
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,555
Only me,
Carmen Electra!

314
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,014
I knew it!

315
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,891
And I'm some
actor they hired!

316
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,686
Frame Up is
Fox's latest hit,

317
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,481
right after
No Pants Island
and Fart Date!

318
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,900
This whole thing
was a joke?

319
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,070
I've never been
so relieved!

320
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,447
Relieved and angry.

321
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,532
So wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

322
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,367
You tied up
the judicial system,

323
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,536
costing the city
millions of dollars,

324
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,204
just for a TV show?

325
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,330
Yes.

326
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,748
And I'm gonna be
in the show?

327
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:09,833
Yes!

328
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,544
Can Eddy and Lou
have producer credits?
Yup!

329
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,296
Now what are
your last names?

330
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,798
We don't have them.
We're like Cher.

331
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,886
Oh, Homie.
I'm so lucky
to be married

332
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,889
to such a selfless
and loving man.

333
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,727
Mom, Dad!
Thank God you're okay!

334
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,855
We were in the greenroom.
I had so much shrimp.

335
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,941
Well, I'm glad
everyone's all right.

336
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,193
But I think you
should be ashamed.

337
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:40,030
Toying with a human life
for TV ratings.

338
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,657
Uh, Homer.
My face is up here.

339
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,743
I've made my choice.

340
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,630
