40
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,506
in light of your unbelievable
contempt for human life,

41
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,516
this court fines you
$3 million.

Ooh, there's going to be
a town meeting

49
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,328
to decide how to spend
Mr. Burns' money.

50
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,713
Oh, what a boon it could be

51
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,999
for our underfunded
public schools.

52
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,880
Children, it's time
for your history lesson.

00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,803

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,640
{\an8}Mmm, excellent.

60
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,530
Come on, Lis, we both know
how this money should--

61
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,899
nay, must be spent.

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,909

Bart, we'll do anything
you want.

(evil laughter)

68
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,256
Well, I think we should
spend the money on something

69
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,683
the whole town
can be proud of.

70
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,522

that says, "No fat chicks"?

71
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,558
No.

72
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,523
Ooh, it looks like everyone in
Springfield showed up for this.

73
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,726
-(glass breaking, alarms ringing)
-Ha ha!

74
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,818
Could this town
be any stupider?

75
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,164
Order. Please rise
for the Pledge of Allegiance.

76
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,581
Get to the money!

77
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,239
In a moment.

78
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,827
First, let's review the minutes
from our last meeting.

79
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,542
-Get to the money!
-Get to the money!

80
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,172
Get to the money!

81
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,579
Very well.

82
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,377
We will now hear suggestions

83
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,170
for the, uh, disbursement
of the, uh, $2 million.

84
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,795
Don't you mean $3 million?

85
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,046
Of course.
How silly of me.

86
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,425
Excuse me.

87
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,181
We could use the money
to hire firemen

88
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,853
to finally put out that blaze
on the east side of town.

89
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,392
Boring!

90
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,055
Hello.
My name is Mr. Snrub,

91
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,935
and I come from, uh...
someplace far away.

92
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,034
Yes, that will do.

93
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,779
Anyway, I-- I say
we invest that money

94
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,452
back in the nuclear plant.

95
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,700
I like the way Snrub thinks.

96
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:28,452
(grumbling)

97
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,957
Pardon me, but I would like
to see this money

98
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,255
spent on more police officers.

99
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,379
I have been shot
eight times this year,

100
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,256
and as a result,
I almost missed work.

101
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,434
Crybaby!

102
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:49,141
My name is Marge Simpson
and I have an idea.

103
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,523
It may sound a little
boring at first.

104
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,811
Chat away.
I'll just amuse myself

105
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,055
with some pornographic
playing cards.

106
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,437
Oh.

107
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,073
Well, surely
you've all noticed

108
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,990
the terrible condition
Main Street is in.

109
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,738
<i>Many of us have destroyed it</i>

110
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,624
<i>by leaving winter chains</i>
<i>on our tires</i>

111
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,581
<i>and carrying</i>
<i>too much weight.</i>

112
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,078
Woo-hoo!
Look at that pavement fly.

113
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,956
MARGE: <i>And those potholes</i>
<i>are becoming a real nuisance.</i>

114
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,465
Now hold on just one minute.

115
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:30,062
Sure, we <i>could</i> fix up
Main Street.

116
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,849
We <i>could</i> put all our eggs
in one basket.

117
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,694
(cheering)

118
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,189
Shut up!

119
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,810
I wasn't done yet.

120
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,437
I'm just saying,
we <i>could</i> blow all our money

121
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,895
on a stupid little street,
but--

122
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,815
(cheering)

123
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,025
Oh, I ain't fer it.

124
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,656
I'm agin' it.

125
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,622
ALL (chanting):
Main Street! Main Street! Main Street!

126
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,793
All those in favor
of Grampa Simpson's plan

127
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,922
for rebuilding Main Street,
please--

128
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,419
(whistling)

129
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,921
You know, a town with money
is a little like

130
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,883
the mule with
a spinning wheel.

131
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,384
No one knows how he got it,

132
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,375
and danged if he knows
how to use it.

133
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,387
(laughter)

134
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,219
Heh, heh... mule.

135
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,224
The name's Lanley,
Lyle Lanley,

136
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,177
and I come before
you good people tonight

137
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,978
with an idea.
Probably the greatest--

138
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,902
Oh, it's not for you.

139
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,901
It's more of
a Shelbyville idea.

140
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,994
Now, wait just a minute.

141
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,319
We're twice as smart as
the people of Shelbyville.

142
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,655
Just tell us your idea
and we'll vote for it.

143
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,370
All right,
I tell you what I'll do.

144
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,752
I'll show you my idea.

145
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,369
I give you
the Springfield monorail.

146
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,828
(all gasping)

147
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,457
I've sold monorails
to Brockway, Ogdenville,

148
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,915
and North Haverbrook.

149
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,625
{\an8}And by gum, it put them
on the map.

150
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,376
Well, sir,
there's nothing on earth

151
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,258
like a genuine, bona fide,
electrified, six-car monorail.

152
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,055
-What I say?
-Monorail!

153
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,889
-What's it called?
-BOTH: Monorail.

154
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,894
That's right, monorail!

155
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,016

D'oh!

181
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,321
(chanting)
Monorail, monorail, monorail.

182
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,737
I still think we
should have spent the money

183
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,405
to fix Main Street.

184
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,584
Well, you should have written
a song like that guy.

185

(grumbles)

186
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,169
Thank you for coming,
Mr. Lanley.

187
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,420
I'm Miss Hoover.

188
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,501
Miss Hoover?

189
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,955
That is hard
to believe.

190
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,545
Oh, you.

191
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,510
Now I'm here to answer
any questions

192
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,050
you children may have
about the monorail.

193
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,393
CHILDREN:
Me! Me! Me!

194
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,798
-Can it outrun The Flash?
-You bet.

195
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,967
Can Superman
outrun The Flash?

196
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,976
Uh... sure. Why not?

197
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,888
Hello, little girl.
Wondering if your dolly

198
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,977
can ride the monorail
for free?

199
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,822
Hardly. I'd like you
to explain why we should build

200
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,898
a mass transit system
in a small town

201
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,994
with a centralized population.

202
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,649
(laughs) Young lady,

203
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,317
that's the most
intelligent question

204
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,576
-I've ever been asked.
-Really?

205
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,028
Oh, I could give you
an answer,

206
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,488
but the only ones
who'd understand it

207
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,038
would be you and me,

208
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,081
and that includes
your teacher.

209
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,084
(giggling)

210
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,206
Next question.

211
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,213
You there, eating the paste.

212
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,455

228
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,668
Homer, no.

229
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,340
It's my lifelong dream.

230
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,128
Your lifelong dream

231
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,671
was to run out on the field
during a baseball game,

232
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,415
and you did it last year,
remember?

233
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,723
Oh, yeah.

234
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,433
LANLEY:
Good evening.

235
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,274
Before we begin,

236
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,020
is anyone here
an investigative reporter?

237
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,601
I am and she is.

238
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,516
Well, I'd like you
to please leave.

239
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,935
Should we take
our hidden camera?

240
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,283
-Would you?
-Let's go, Phil.

241
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,991
"True or false:

242
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,571
You can get mono
from riding the monorail."

243
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,237
Mmm... false.

244
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,075
No, wait.
Maybe it's true.

245
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,830
No, you were right.
It's false.

246
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,832
Wow, you really are
gonna be

247
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,124
a monorail conductor.

248
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,577
That's right, boy.

249
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,707
You know, I used to think
you were stuck

250
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,674
in an emasculating,
go-nowhere job.

251
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,884
(chuckles)
Kids.

252
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,973
But now, I want to follow
in your footsteps.

253
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,220
Do you want to change
your name to Homer, Junior?

254
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,512
The kids can call you Hoju.

255
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,426
I'll get back to you.

256
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,635
Come on, keep it coming.

257
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,725
Over.

258
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,270
Over.

259
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,273
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

260
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,605
Hi, Homer!

261
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,030
Oh, I hate that sound.

262
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,072
According to this book,
the monorail goes

263
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,865
over 150 miles an hour.

264
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,199
What if something
goes wrong?

265
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,373
What if?

266
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,411
What if I'm taking a shower

267
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,905
and I slip on a bar of soap?

268
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,786
Oh, my God, I'd be killed!

269
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,383
It frightens me
that you want to work

270
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,168
on something
that's so unsafe.

271
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,212
We monorail conductors
are a crazy breed--

272
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,666
half in love with death,

273
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,546
gobbling up danger
like ordinary men eat peanuts.

274
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,974
Am I turning you on?

275
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,143
-No.
-What if I undo this button?

276
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,432
Good night, Homer.

277
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,135
(deepens voice)
What if I talk like this?

278
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,436
What if I sing to you?

279
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:15,360
<i>♪ I gave my love a chicken</i>
<i>that had no bone... ♪</i>

280
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,703
Mmm, chicken.
(licking lips)

281
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,779
So, then, mono means "one,"

282
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,776
and rail means "rail,"

283
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,868
and that concludes our
intensive three-week course.

284
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,254
Hey, wait, man!

285
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,790
Who gets to be conductor?

286
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,424
Oh, right, that.

287
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Well, I've been monitoring
your progress closely,

288
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,877
but this gentleman here clearly
stands out above the rest.

289
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,054
Who, me?

290
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,012
-Yeah, sure.
-Woo-hoo!

291
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,722
<i>After an exhaustive search,</i>

292
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,222
<i>Springfield has found</i>
<i>its monorail conductor--</i>

{\an8}<i>Homer Simpson.</i>

294
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,596
This is the snack holder

295
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:54,146
where I can put my beverage,
or, if you will, cupcake.

296
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,861
Wow, Dad, you really
know your monorails.

297
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,396
(hissing)

298
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,368
Homer, there's a family
of possums in here.

299
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,369
I call the big one Bitey.

300
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,001
Mmm. I'm going to
see Mr. Lanley.

301
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,501
Mr. Lanley?
Mr. Lanley?

302
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,386
(gasps)
Oh!

303
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,473
How much did you see?

304
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,637
Uh... nothing incriminating.

305
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,646
-Good.
-Well, bye.

306
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,689
I don't know why
I leave this lying around.

307
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,824
<i>I've sold monorails</i>

WOMAN: Go away.

317
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,649
There ain't no monorail,
and there never was.

318
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:21,904
(screams)

319
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,106
Excuse me, miss.

320
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,985
You asked
about the monorail?

321
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,162
Who are you?

322
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,330
My name is Sebastian Cobb.

323
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,409
Lanley hired me
to build his monorail.

324
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,955
He cut corners everywhere--

325
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,538
bad wiring, faulty brakes,

326
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,923
and the celebrity on
the maiden voyage was Gallagher.

327
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,051
This is all that's left

328
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,470
of one of the crappiest
trains ever built.

329
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,220
Mr. Cobb,
what can we do?

330
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,853
You just better have
a damn good conductor.

331
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,851
I locked my keys
in there.

332
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:53,813
Get a rock.

333
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,404
Ladies and gentlemen,
nothing brings out the stars

334
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,904
like the maiden voyage
of a monorail.

335
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,657
Everyone's here--

336
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,949
from recently-outed
leading man Dash Calhoun

337
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,624
to Krusty the Clown.

338
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,912
Hey, hey!

339
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,535
Krusty, why won't you
answer my calls?

340
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,622
You've never even
seen our son.

341
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,337
(babbling)

342
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,748
Here's one of those lovable
high schoolers

343
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,467
from TV's
"Springfield Heights, 90210."

344
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,928
He's cool.
He's sexy.

345
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,299
He's 34 years old.

346
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,295
Let's hear it
for Kyle Derin.

347
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,757
(women screaming)

348
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,847
And here's
country singing sensation

349
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,603
Lurline Lumpkin,

350
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,944
fresh from her latest stay
at the Betty Ford Clinic.

351
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,401
(crowd cheering)

352
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,521
What you been up to,
Lurline?

353
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,898
I spent last night
in a ditch.

354
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,775
How about that, folks?

355
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:50,122
Now I'd like to turn things
over to our grand marshal,

356
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,989
Mr. Leonard Nimoy.

357
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,616
Heh heh. I'd say this vessel
could do at least warp five.

358
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,294
(laughter)

359
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,293
And let me say,

360
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,915
"May the force
be with you."

361
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,462
Do you even know
who I am?

362
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,915
I think I do.

363
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,915
Weren't you one of
the Little Rascals?

364
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,103
Mr. Lanley!

365
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,258
Aren't you gonna ride
the monorail?

366
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,097
Little lady, I'd love to,
but I have to catch a plane.

367
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,773
But the ride only takes
a minute.

368
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,851
Yeah, well, my plane leaves
in less than one minute.

369
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,404
All aboard!

370
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,195
(electricity crackling)

371
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,458
We're too late!

372
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,375
I shouldn't have stopped
for that haircut. Sorry.

373
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,221
(jazzy lounge music playing)

374
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:58,602
Actually, you see, the doors
on "Star Trek" were not mechanical.

375
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,734
We had a stagehand
on either side

376
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,441
who would pull the door open
when he saw you approach.

377
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,902
Uh-huh.

378
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,362
Stick your head
out the window, boy.

379
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,783
It's the greatest.

380
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,451
Yee-ha!

381
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,794
BOTH: Aah!

382
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,619
(alarm blaring)

383
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,836
Can't you stop it,
Dad?

384
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,045
I'm trying my best.

385
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,465
(electronic tones)

386
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,893
WOMAN'S VOICE:
<i>The lever you have pulled--</i>

387
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,521
<i>"brakes"--</i>
<i>is not in service.</i>

388
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,889
<i>Please make a note of it.</i>

389
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,845
How fast are they going?

390
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,515
(Homer screams)

391
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,904
Well, judging by your
husband's cowardly scream,

392
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,111
-180 miles an hour.
-HOMER: Yee!

393
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,569
(distant shouting)

394
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,743
Ugh. It's making me dizzy.

395
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,322
I'm gonna take a nap.

396
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,617
All right,
I'm in charge here.

397
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,120
Oh, run along, Quimby.

398
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,662
I think they're dedicating
a phone booth somewhere.

399
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,616
Watch it, you talking tub
of doughnut batter.

400
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,626
Hey, I got pictures
of you, Quimby.

401
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,538
You don't scare me.
That could be anyone's ass.

402
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,377
Now beat it.
I'm calling the shots.

403
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,423
I think that sash is cutting
off the air to your brain.

404
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:16,138
The town charter says that
in an emergency, I run the show.

405
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,430
Well, we'll just see
about that.

406
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,893
Let's go to town hall.

407
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,392
Fine!

408
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,894
Should we take one car
or should I follow you?

409
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,346
(screaming)

410
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,646
Hey, according to the charter,
as chief constable,

411
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,610
I'm supposed to get
a pig every month.

412
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,070
"...and two comely lasses
of virtue true."

413
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,202
QUIMBY: Keep the pig.

414
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,698
How many broads
do I get? Hey.

415
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,620
Hey! Hey, let go,
you're ripping it!

416
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,028
-No, you are!
-No, you are!

417
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,907
Let go.
That's the charter.

418
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:40,953
(screaming)

419
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,446
Wait a minute.

420
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,958
We can just shut off
the power.

421
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,329
No such luck.

422
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,995
-It's solar-powered.
-Solar power.

423
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,495
When will people learn?

424
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:56,587
A solar eclipse.
The cosmic ballet goes on.

425
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,347
Does anyone want
to switch seats?

426
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,308
(engine powering down)

427
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,102
(cheering)

428
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,308
I did it.

429
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,399
D'oh!

430
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,701
<i>Folks, this is</i>
<i>your captain speaking.</i>

431
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,279
<i>Our non-stop flight</i>
<i>to Tahiti</i>

432
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,124
<i>will be making</i>
<i>a brief layover</i>

433
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,739
<i>in North Haverbrook.</i>

434
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,536
North Haverbrook.
Where have I heard that name before?

435
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,410
Oh, no.
Oh, no!

436
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,667
There he is.
Seat 3-F.

437
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,209
(angry shouting)

438
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,343
-(angry shouting)
-(Lanley grunting)

439
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,586
Krusty wants out.

440
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,638
No.

441
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,392
The world needs laughter.

442
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,143
Are we gonna die, son?

443
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,185
Yeah, but at least
we'll take

444
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,019
a lot of innocent
people with us.

445
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,734
MARGE: <i>Homer? Homer?</i>

446
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,654
-Yello.
-Homer, there's a man here

447
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,233
who thinks he can help you.

448
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,318
-Batman?
-No. He's a scientist.

449
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,403
Batman's a scientist.

450
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,857
It's not Batman!

451
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,237
I think I have a way
to stop the train.

452
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,575
You need to find an anchor
of some sort.

453
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:09,959
Think harder, Homer.

454
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,963
(gasps)

455
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,592
I'll take that.

456
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,691
Uh, Dad...

457
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,652
(screams)

458
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,003
Now,
separating Siamese twins

459
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,672
is a long
and costly procedure.

460
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:02,136
Aargh!
You call that an anchor?

461
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,984
Huh?

462
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,743
Donuts.

463
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,160
Is there anything
they can't do?

464
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,529
Dad! You're a hero.

465
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,116
Yes, son.

466
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,081
I'm the best mono-thingy guy
there ever was.

467
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,082
(cheering)

468
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,424
Well, my work
is done here.

469
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,540
What do you mean,
your work is done?

470
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,747
You didn't do anything.

471
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,837
(chuckles)

472
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,921
Didn't I?
