174
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,337
No, I mean ketchup.

175
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,924
Where's your sense
of magic and wonder?

176
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,136
Come on, Marge. When
are you going to call?

177
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,220
(RINGING)

178
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,439
Let it ring, play hard to get.
That's hard enough!

179
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,267
Oh, my darling, I love you!
Please forgive me!

180
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,482
MOE: Hey, Homer. 
Moe, what are you calling me for?

181
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,938
You told me to call.
You wanted to see

182
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,193
if your phone
was working.

183
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,025
But what if Marge tries to
call while I'm talking to you?

184
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,234
Ain't you got
call waiting?

185
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,737
Of course, I have
call waiting, you idiot!

186
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,289
I just never
learned how to use it!

187
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,538
Uh-oh, I might have broken the phone.
I better call Moe.

you get off the line?

I'm coming home.

193
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,108
Oh, Marge, what
a pleasant surprise.

194
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,526
I'm at a rest stop
south of Springfield.

195
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,401
I know.
You're sorry now.

196
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,486
Then you'll buy me some
Kwik-E-Mart flowers

197
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,913
maybe a box of candy,
where half the pieces

198
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,582
mysteriously
have testing bites,

199
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,375
and a week
later you'll be back

200
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,078
to your old
thoughtless self.

201
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,165
No, no, it's not going
to be like that, I swear.

202
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,252
Ew! Lemon cream. 
You're going in the Marge pile.

203
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,679
I mean,
I love you so much.

204
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,139

Listen, buster, I had to buy
a club soda I didn't want

209
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,978

for this phone.

give it the phone.

got in his pocket.

Yummy, yummy kelp-

00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,539
Good girl,
yes, yes.

217
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,213
This animal
means you no harm.

218
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,381
She's a sweet old
Florida manatee,

219
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,834
also known as
a sea cow or dugong.

220
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:29,512
HOMER: <i>Hello, Marge, where do we keep
the socks that don't smell like feet?</i>

221
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,214
I'll call you back.

222
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,223
I'm Dr. Caleb Thorn

223
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,395
and I would do anything
to protect a manatee

224
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,143
except harm
another manatee.

225
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,517
What if by harming
a manatee

226
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,317
you could save
two manatees?

227
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,942
But before you answer,
consider this.

228
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,569
The manatee you'd have
to harm is pregnant.

229
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,156
Those are the questions
that keep me up at night.

230
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,577
(GROANS)

231
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,534
I see a manatee
the needs a hug.

232
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,543
Ooh!

233
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,045
HOMER: <i>Hello, Marge?</i>

234
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,842
<i>Does the pizza
guy take a check?</i>

235
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,840
<i>If so, where do we
keep the checks?</i>

236
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,342
<i>And lastly,
how do you write a check?</i>

237
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,385
I think the worst
part was when I realized

238
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,935
that Homer lied to me.

239
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,805
From what you've told
me, it sounds like

240
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,516
what your husband did
was nothing new.

241
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,816
Exactly.

242
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,856
I have a saying
which goes,

243
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,437
"You can't teach
a manatee any tricks."

244
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,023
Maybe you could just put a hat
on him and say it's a trick.

245
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,781
My point is Homer is the
exact same man you married

246
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,986
and if there's
a problem here,

247
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,197
it's that you keep
expecting him to change.

248
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,372
Huh!

249
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,668
MARGE: <i>He cares so much 
about those doggone dugongs.</i>

250
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,871
<i>I wish I felt
that kind of passion.</i>

251
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,921
<i>Maybe I should join
him on his mission.</i>

252

00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,834
while you're sitting there
staring at the ceiling

in the parking lot

255
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,965

in a walrus.

256
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,100

good for business.

I'll be good.

00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,316
Can I get out of
the dog carrier?

260
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,569
It was hard enough getting you in there.
I'm not letting you out.

261
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,654
Yeah, she came
through here.

262
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,906
I believe she
was looking

263
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,983
to rekindle
her passion for life.

Oh, no, no.

00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,207
"Handsome" means he look at
himself in the mirror all day.

00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,815
I just can't find it in my
heart to come back right now.

352
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,642
Well, that's
very reasonable.

You stole my wife!
I'll kill you!

Homer, I have no interest
in stealing your wife

355
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,483
but Marge is getting something
from her work with me.

356
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,410
Something a strong, passionate
woman like her needs.

357
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,612
A Purpose.

WOW!

359
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,078
I can see why
she loves you.

360
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,918
She doesn't love me. She's
just trying to find herself.

(EXHALES)
You know everything.

362
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,080
I don't know everything.
I'm just a man.

363

And what a man!

364
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,972
Okay, the key to this
thing is the manatees.

365
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,341
Is Marge saving them or killing them?
Saving!

366
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,847
Okay. To save the manatees,
I guess I could donate

367
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,476
my time and money
and help them build a...

368

Why don't you pick
on someone your own size?

378
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,331
They are roughly our size.

379
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,878
In fact,
they're bigger than us.

380
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,007
Look, if it were up to me I'd
be harassing them with you.

381
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,551
If anything, I'd be the
guy who took it too far.

and I want to win her back!

You're a brave man.
And we respect two things,

you to vacate these waters.
