- Want to know what it is?

No.

75
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:04,412

this race and no one suspects.

thousand-to-one odds.

my action to Willie.

the rent, Willie.

I'll have it by Friday, Mr. U.
I swear.

Rounding out the pack are all
the kids that we never see.

110
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:35,338
What's this? Milhouse
takes the lead?

111
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:38,611
<i>The same boy who sprained his shoulder
doing the Pledge of Allegiance?</i>

Uh-oh! If Milhouse wins this
race, we're out a fortune.

114
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:47,150
Don't worry. The race takes a turn
through the trees where no one can see.

115
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:49,525
When Milhouse gets there,
you know what to do.

116
00:05:49,545 --> 00:05:53,525
Oh, yeah. Totally.
I mean, it's so obvious.

117
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,020
- Just punch him!
- Exactly.

118
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:59,980
Right in the nnn...
fff... dee...?

And what does he
have to jump over?

122
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,458
Nothing, that's what.
I'm out of here.

128

146
00:07:27,106 --> 00:07:31,386
Son! What happened to you in the
dark place behind the school?

147
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:32,689
Something good?

148
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:36,858
I'm afraid I
don't remember.

149
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,095
Whew.

150
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:40,496
Well, it looks like Milhouse
has traumatic amnesia.

151
00:07:40,508 --> 00:07:42,245
He may never remember
what happened to him.

152
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:45,964
The most important thing is, the
race results are now official.

153
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:49,536
Now I've got to look at some severe
cases of ice cream headache.

166

A chicken feather? Why
would you hand this to me?

167
00:08:31,784 --> 00:08:35,371
Oh, you must've figured out
I chickened out during the race.

168
00:08:35,393 --> 00:08:38,223
Well, who are you

00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:52,329
Marge, if this stupid, one-reactor town
won't put on a fireworks show, I will.

173
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,997
I've mapped it out.

174
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:55,155
(laughs)

175
00:08:55,193 --> 00:08:57,305
- Hmm?
- (groans)

176
00:08:58,229 --> 00:09:01,980
Maybe we should just light
sparklers in the backyard.

177
00:09:01,993 --> 00:09:05,075
Eh, I've had my problems
with sparklers.

178
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,231
Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun!
Fun! Fun! Fun!

179
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:08,905
(screams)

180
00:09:08,934 --> 00:09:11,834
LISA: <i>But Fourth of July fireworks
were a different story.</i>

181
00:09:11,847 --> 00:09:15,588
<i>They meant more to my dad
than my Mom could ever know.</i>

182
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:17,468
<i>It was the one night
of every year</i>

183
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:19,915
<i>that he couldn't hear
his parents argue.</i>

184
00:09:19,941 --> 00:09:24,596
<i>He figured it was because they loved
the fireworks just as much as he did.</i>

185
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:26,549
I want to take a class!

186
00:09:26,572 --> 00:09:29,973
Why can't you be happy
ironing my shirts?!

187
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,389
I need space!

188
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,209
Then close your eyes
and go to Hawaii!

189
00:09:35,246 --> 00:09:38,284
LISA: <i>With his mom gone,
Homer needed a hero,</i>

190
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:41,442
<i>and no one was a bigger hero
than the magical little man</i>

191
00:09:41,462 --> 00:09:43,299
<i>behind the controls.</i>

192
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:45,318
(fireworks whistling)

193
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:48,774
- Are you God?
- No, no.

194
00:09:48,794 --> 00:09:52,340
But I shoot rockets
into his a-face.

195
00:09:52,364 --> 00:09:57,011
Here's-a my card. Don't
forget to treasure it.

196
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,602
Hmm.

197
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:02,169
Now let's see. Which
pants have that card?

198
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:04,395
Board shorts,
interested shorts.

199
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,025
Here we are.

200
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:08,520
Kaboom.

201
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:13,255
Giuseppe, I want you to
come out of retirement

202
00:10:13,268 --> 00:10:16,091
for the greatest fireworks
show of your career.

203
00:10:16,104 --> 00:10:19,456
Why do you come here and
remind me of a time in my life

204
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:22,990
when I made a-tons of money
doing a-what I love?

205
00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:25,556
If the <i>Expendables</i> movies
have taught us anything,

206
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:29,968
it's that people do their best work
after they're old and forgotten.

207
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:33,820
Well, I am younger
than Sylvester Stallone.

208
00:10:33,838 --> 00:10:35,518
I will do it!

209
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:43,555
- Hey, buddy.
- Bart, my truest friend.

210
00:10:43,582 --> 00:10:45,384
I brought you a cake.

211
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:46,651
Read it.

212
00:10:46,671 --> 00:10:48,663
That's an odd message.

213
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,280
But who am I to
argue with icing?

214
00:10:51,295 --> 00:10:54,295
Will you watch <i>Cassidy
the Crocodile</i> with me?

215
00:10:54,314 --> 00:10:59,046
- Um, that's kind of a baby show.
- It's all I can handle now.

216
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,407
(sighs)

217
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,000
Henrietta Kitten?
Will you marry me?

218
00:11:05,023 --> 00:11:06,763
Meow, meow, maybe.

219
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:09,628
Why would a kitten marry a crocodile?
Wouldn't it eat her?

220
00:11:09,648 --> 00:11:10,748
(shushes)

221
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:13,349
Suspension of disbelief.

222
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:16,158
Friends help friends
in trouble.

223
00:11:16,182 --> 00:11:18,861
No! Turn it off! It's
too intense for me!

224
00:11:18,884 --> 00:11:22,632
Some guys just can't
handle crocodiles.

225
00:11:22,658 --> 00:11:23,828
Is it over yet?

226
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:25,162
(chicken clucks)

227
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,002
And if you're dissatisfied
for any reason,

228
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:31,824
I will refund your money
in the form of acorns.

229
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:35,639
(groans)

230
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:39,653
Hey, this gunpowder,
it has a-crystal meth in it.

231
00:11:39,678 --> 00:11:44,211
Crystal meth? Then what the heck did
I sell to them Colombian drug lords?

232
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:49,966
Brandine! We're feuding
with the Escobars again!

233
00:11:49,995 --> 00:11:52,663
Does that mean I ain't
talking to Maria?

234
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:54,404
Duh! Yes.

235
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:58,021
Homer, we will get the
fireworks someplace else.

236
00:11:58,477 --> 00:12:01,861
The pig's been eating
the C-4 blocks again!

237
00:12:01,894 --> 00:12:04,028
(burps)

238
00:12:04,616 --> 00:12:06,221
(dog barks)

239
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:10,253
We've invited a new athlete to
join our do-gooding dream team.

240
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:13,898
Please welcome fleet-footed
phenom, Bart Simpson.

241
00:12:13,924 --> 00:12:15,870
(crowd cheering)

242
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:18,456
Hey, everyone. I sure
got a lot of attention

243
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:20,439
for winning this year's
Race around the School.

244
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,467
(crowd cheering)

245
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:24,274
Completely deserved!

246
00:12:24,303 --> 00:12:28,160
Yeah, yeah. Thank you, Mel. But I
am not here to talk about myself.

247
00:12:28,174 --> 00:12:30,705
Milhouse, would you
join me at the podium?

248
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:32,065
(clamoring)

249
00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:35,025
What's going on? Seriously,
what-what's transpiring?

250
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:36,385
I've got to set things straight.

251
00:12:36,408 --> 00:12:39,260
During that same race, my friend
Milhouse was in the lead,

252
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:41,952
when something
horrible happened!

253
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:47,505
LISA: <i>Bart knew the worst thing
to do was pile lie upon lie.</i>

254
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:49,486
<i>And that's exactly
what he did.</i>

255
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:51,001
Rather than try to figure
out what happened,

256
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,634
Milhouse had the
courage to move on.

257
00:12:52,651 --> 00:12:54,271
To me, that's a hero.

258
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:55,691
(crowd cheering)

259
00:12:55,714 --> 00:12:56,961
Nicely done.

260
00:12:56,988 --> 00:12:59,560
Now we will give out
free rubber bracelets.

261
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:03,421
Do not wear them to bed. They smell
like truck tires. They're disgusting.

262
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:08,999
Crotch or forehead?

263
00:13:09,028 --> 00:13:11,324
Uh, forehead for once.

264
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:13,323
Wha...?

265
00:13:24,355 --> 00:13:26,382
Bart Simpson!

266
00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:29,180
You ran away when I
was getting beat up!

267
00:13:29,214 --> 00:13:30,487
(crowd booing)

268
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:33,057
- Bart's a coward!
- He lied to us!

269
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:34,846
Stop the tattoo!

270
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,222
Uh, I could make it
a bag of groceries.

271
00:13:38,243 --> 00:13:40,790
All right, make sure there's
some French bread sticking out.

272
00:13:40,803 --> 00:13:43,466
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow!

273
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:49,574
(crowd rabbling)

274
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:53,210
Look how he runs now!

275
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:55,816
LISA: <i>So Bart was
revealed as a coward.</i>

276
00:13:55,837 --> 00:13:58,992
<i>And now it seemed like the
whole world was against him.</i>

277
00:13:59,023 --> 00:14:00,481
(screams)

278
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:02,227
(panting)

279
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:05,479
MALE ANNOUNCER: <i>Have you ever
considered a reverse-equity mortgage?</i>

280
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:07,686
That's what put
me in this dump!

281
00:14:07,704 --> 00:14:10,497
Grampa, everyone's
calling me a coward.

282
00:14:10,742 --> 00:14:12,239
Well, join the club.

283
00:14:12,262 --> 00:14:15,685
Anyone who makes it to old age
has got to be part-coward.

284
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:17,901
Come on, you were
in World War II.

285
00:14:17,921 --> 00:14:20,344
Do you know how I
survived D-Day?

286
00:14:22,377 --> 00:14:23,370
(retches)

287
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,887
Don't worry... just a
day at the beach.

288
00:14:29,893 --> 00:14:33,743
I'll be back around 1946!

289
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:36,107
But don't people
hate cowards?

290
00:14:36,113 --> 00:14:38,554
Sure do. But we
outlive the brave.

291
00:14:38,582 --> 00:14:42,263
Leaving us cowards to make
time with the heroes' widows.

292
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:45,564
After Korea, I was
drowning in boobies.

293
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,853
Wow, that sounds
pretty sweet.

294
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,620
Well, there is a price.

295
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,777
Do you wake up sweating
in the middle of the night?

296
00:14:52,797 --> 00:14:55,097
- Yes.
- So do I.

297
00:14:55,123 --> 00:14:58,116
But I get back to sleep by
counting the men I let down.

298
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:04,447
There's Jerry, Izzy, Brooklyn, the
O'Donnell boys, the lost ship PT-108,

299
00:15:04,481 --> 00:15:08,594
the Poor Buggers of Meatloaf
Ridge, the Andrew sisters...

300
00:15:08,611 --> 00:15:10,512
(snoring)

301
00:15:13,642 --> 00:15:15,032
(gasps)

302
00:15:18,902 --> 00:15:21,640
I understand. You
have standards.

303
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:24,153
(gasps)

304
00:15:25,027 --> 00:15:27,407
This is an angry sleepover.

305
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,256
I'm only doing it 'cause
it was on the books.

306
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:35,734
LISA <i>While Bart was in hell, Homer was
happily surrounded by fire and brimstone.</i>

307
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:39,658
Okay, let's make
some fireworks.

308
00:15:39,678 --> 00:15:43,858
Now drive slowly and
a-carefully to my workshop.

309
00:15:43,886 --> 00:15:46,985
It's in-a the
Cobblestone a-District.

310
00:15:50,772 --> 00:15:53,209
Oh, thank God...
a rickety bridge.

311
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,173
Don't worry. We'll be safe in
the Gas a-Lamp a-District.

312
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:07,009
(tires screeching)

313
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:13,982
("Stars and Stripes Forever"
playing)

314
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:31,452
- Can I pitch something?
- Go ahead.

315
00:16:31,475 --> 00:16:35,095
Boom! Biddy bom-bom boom!
Biddy bom bow! Ba-dip-boo!

316
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:36,118
Boom! Boom!

317
00:16:36,137 --> 00:16:38,518
That's-a nice.

We're on it, ma'am!

324
00:16:56,904 --> 00:16:59,782
Okay, coarse gunpowder,
get the ball in there,

325
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:03,901
don't forget the wadding, tamp, tamp,
tamp, fine gunpowder in the pan,

Aw, my boy's having
a bad night.

332
00:17:23,096 --> 00:17:24,883
We should get this
show on the road.

333
00:17:24,907 --> 00:17:27,119
No, the time is
not yet right.

334
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,549
When they look at their
watches and mutter,

335
00:17:29,572 --> 00:17:32,613
"Hey, when are these
a-jerks going to a-start?"

336
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:35,813
That's when they're
ready to be enchanted.

337
00:17:35,832 --> 00:17:37,279
Come on, let's go!

338
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:41,524
I can't stand to see my family
unhappy on America's holiest day.

339
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:47,372
Actually, July 2 is when
congress declared independence,

340
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:50,538
the date that-a
should be celebrated.

341
00:17:50,557 --> 00:17:54,118
Hey, Super Mario. Don't you
tell me about America!

342
00:17:54,685 --> 00:17:57,189
- Idiot! I'm-a right!
- No, you're a-wrong!

343
00:17:57,215 --> 00:18:00,249
"July 2" ... I am
quoting John Adams!

344
00:18:00,275 --> 00:18:01,383
Who the hell is that?

345
00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:02,579
(both grunt)

346
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,299
(all screaming)

347
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:10,248
Oh, dear. The term "target audience"
is taking on a sinister connotation.

348
00:18:14,764 --> 00:18:17,031
Milhouse, this is my chance
to make things right.

349
00:18:17,051 --> 00:18:19,264
What are you up to now?

350
00:18:19,295 --> 00:18:22,068
Get on that bus! I'll explain
during the explosions!

351
00:18:22,094 --> 00:18:27,316
Don't a-panic! We'll be okay as long
as the sequence doesn't a-start.

352
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:29,836
Hit Bart's dad in the butt!

353
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:31,243
Roger that.

354
00:18:31,273 --> 00:18:32,840
Did you factor
in the wind?

355
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:33,951
No.

358

359
00:18:46,616 --> 00:18:48,443
(cackles)

360
00:18:48,465 --> 00:18:50,900
(all clamoring)

361
00:18:53,209 --> 00:18:55,109
(coughing)

362
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:56,694
So, who is our hero?

363
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,177
- I hope it's Carl.
- Nah, no such luck.

364
00:18:59,209 --> 00:19:02,289
I was just Tweeting a picture of
what I thought was my last meal.

365
00:19:02,312 --> 00:19:04,337
Hot dog and French fries!

366
00:19:07,016 --> 00:19:08,349
(all gasping)

367
00:19:10,345 --> 00:19:13,586
Milhouse is our
unlikely savior!

368
00:19:13,603 --> 00:19:16,604
MAN: Quit explaining
everything, let him talk.

369
00:19:16,624 --> 00:19:19,218
Well, it wasn't me.
It was Bart who...

370
00:19:19,238 --> 00:19:23,085
Saw everything you did.
Milhouse is the hero.

371
00:19:23,112 --> 00:19:26,014
Take it from me, the boy
who's lied throughout.

372
00:19:26,043 --> 00:19:28,743
ALL:
Milhouse! Milhouse!

373
00:19:28,756 --> 00:19:31,890
Oh, I get it now.
Thanks, Bart.

374
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:36,309
LISA: <i>So Milhouse got the
redemption he deserved,</i>

375
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:38,852

way, did Bart.</i>

376
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:41,737
ALL:
Coward! Coward! Coward!

377
00:19:41,756 --> 00:19:43,692
LISA: <i>Which meant
that, at long last,</i>

378
00:19:43,713 --> 00:19:46,915

(slow melody playing on piano)

380
00:19:56,772 --> 00:19:59,193
Oh, enough doom and gloom!

381
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:01,582
(playing upbeat melody)

382
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:16,806
Look, Maggie, I
undid my deed.

383
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,468
So I'm just gonna take your
feather and say good night.

384
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:22,972
Oh, where are these
coming from?

385
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:27,964
Oh, I see. That's
all you wanted.

386
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,518
How's that, kiddo?

387
00:20:32,382 --> 00:20:34,763
