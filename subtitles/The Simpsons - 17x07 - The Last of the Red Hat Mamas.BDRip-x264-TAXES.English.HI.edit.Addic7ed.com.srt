Zero to the right, zero to
the left, (DIAL CLICKING)

351
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,243

(POLICE SIREN WAILING)

353
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,643
Marge, l wanted to save you from the cops.
But the cops followed me!

354
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,200
Game over, man!
Game over!

355
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,244
So are you gonna introduce
me to your friends?

356
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,722
Don't worry, Mr. Burns. We'll
get to the bottom of this.

357
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,451
Excuse me, Lou.
I'm supposed to say that.

358
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,126
Acting like the chief
doesn't make you the chief.

359
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,642
If I was acting like the
chief, I'd need size 58 pants.

360
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,960
Oh, here we go
with the fat jokes.

361
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,849
You know, I just wish you
could hit the easy targets

362
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,445
on the firing range
so well.

363
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,451
Oh, Lou, why do we
hurt each other so?

364
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,409
Because sometimes
it's easier to be cruel

365
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,448
than to say what
you really feel.

366
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,005
Permission to hug, Chief?

367
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,489
Permission (SOBS) granted.

368
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,528
Granted, Lou!
Thank you, Chief!

369
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,880
Oh, enough!

370
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,364
While you morons
are canoodling,

371
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,249
someone's burgling
my miscellanea.

373
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,531
Try to take my eggs,
will you?

374
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,967
Well, this rooster
has a beak.

375
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,362
A beak which calls out
death-a-doodle-doo.

376
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,525
Why, you're all women.

377
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,965
I'm not.

378
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,562
I suppose. But you're
certainly buxom and flirty.

379
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,968
Oh, well, l try to
have a good time.

380
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,005
All I wanted to do
was join a group

381
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,566

the same outfits!

385
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,565
Oh, no jury on earth
would convict

386
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,449
a bunch of
moist-eyed mothers.

387
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,244
I'll tell you
what, ladies.

388
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,800
Give me my eggs back
and I'll let you go.

392
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,170
Well, I guess our
fundraiser was a failure.

393
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,483
Don't be so sure.

394
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,561
Ah, Marge, I love you.

395
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,971
But to be safe,
sweetie, I don't think

396
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,088
we can ever see
each other again.

397
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,401
I'll really
miss you guys.

398
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,848

activities we did together.

Listen, Marge.

401
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,528
No matter where you go
in this life,

402
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,210
you'll always have
one friend

403
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,282
who loves you,
body and soul.

404
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,803
And Marge,
there are certain things

405
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,282
I can do for you that
no other friend can.

406
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,044
Special things.

happened to me twice!
