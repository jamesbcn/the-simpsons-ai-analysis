NARRATOR:
<i>High above Zenith City,</i>

00:01:37,108 --> 00:01:39,549
<i>Radioactive Man keeps
a lonely vigil!</i>

28
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:40,565
RADIOACTIVE MAN:
<i>All seems quiet.</i>

29
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:42,659
<i>Maybe I'll fly to China</i>
<i>and get some takeout.</i>

30
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:43,657
(gasps)

31
00:01:43,682 --> 00:01:45,562
A sky tweet from
Commissioner Sweeney!

32
00:01:45,584 --> 00:01:49,406
This looks like a job for:
@radioactivemanó01.

33
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:50,901
(whooshing)

34
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:54,676
Leaping Leptons! It's
the Fossil Fuel Four!

35
00:01:54,693 --> 00:01:56,373
Old King Coal...

36
00:01:56,385 --> 00:01:58,140
Patroleus Rex...

37
00:01:58,163 --> 00:02:00,578
French Femme Fatale
Charcoal Briquette...

38
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,523
...and the enemy of
drinking water everywhere,

39
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,516
the Fracker.

40
00:02:05,564 --> 00:02:07,381
(grunting with effort)

41
00:02:08,993 --> 00:02:10,782
Stop attacking the
nuclear plant...

42
00:02:10,809 --> 00:02:12,838
this country's safest
energy source!

43
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:17,396
Studies show, <i>I'm</i> America's best hope
for energy independence. (laughs)

44
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,424
Those studies were
industry financed.

45
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,067
You lie!

46
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,293
Holy Hedrons!

47
00:02:23,313 --> 00:02:24,562
I need backup!

48
00:02:25,097 --> 00:02:28,070
Calling Citizen Solar, and
his sidekick Wind Lad.

49
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:31,463
(French accent): I believe you
will find them lacking in energy.

50
00:02:31,483 --> 00:02:33,560
It's too cloudy.

51
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,876
People don't like
the noise I make.

52
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:38,069
Ehhh...

53
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:43,020
Petroleus Rex, please
remember when you used to be

54
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:45,127
Environmental Scientist
Rex Bernstein.

55
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,589
I have become my <i>destiny.</i>

56
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:55,318
(grunts, groans)

57
00:02:57,315 --> 00:02:59,832
I'll crush you like
a gnat, King Coal.

58
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,377
(shouting in pain)

59
00:03:03,648 --> 00:03:05,177
(grunting with effort)

60
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:07,029
(shouting)

61
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:16,066
Half life.

62
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:17,867
Quar... ter life.

63
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:19,778
Eighth life.

64
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,443
Gone.

65
00:03:22,347 --> 00:03:24,237
Frack-cellent!

66
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:25,795
(laughs sinisterly)

67
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:30,050
They killed off
Radioactive Man?

68
00:03:30,074 --> 00:03:32,074
I did not see that coming.

69
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:34,287
Die-carumba!

70
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:38,452
They'll just reboot Radioactive Man
in an overpriced new origin issue

71
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:42,104
and get clueless fanboys like you
to line up at midnight to buy them.

72
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:44,464
Clueless fanboys in costume.

73
00:03:44,495 --> 00:03:45,692
(text alert chimes)

74
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:47,844
MILHOUSE:
Wow!

75
00:03:47,865 --> 00:03:49,098
Midnight.

76
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:51,867
I won't know which day
to write in my diary.

77
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,150
- Homer.
- What?

78
00:03:53,156 --> 00:03:55,417
Will you take me to buy a comic
book Tuesday at midnight?

79
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,520
And miss the back
half of Jimmy Kimmel?

80
00:03:57,555 --> 00:03:59,686
That's when
he experiments, boy.

81
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:02,659
You never watched an episode
of Jimmy Kimmel in your life.

82
00:04:02,687 --> 00:04:05,474
Yes, I have. After the
Oscars, when he forces you.

83
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,929
(Ralph Wiggum singing
random melody)

84
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:13,383
(door bell dings,
all cheering, clapping)

85
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:14,719
Quiet. Quiet!

86
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:17,639
And attention please,
valued customers.

87
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:21,499
You will each be allowed to enter
the store, and buy <i>one</i> copy.

88
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:23,889
Swallow your gum, <i>now.</i>

89
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:24,662
(all gulp)

90
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:27,676
MILTON: Oh. Oh. Mr. Book Guy.
Can I go first?

91
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:30,837
I was once cast to play
Fallout Boy in a movie.

92
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,564
Tell it to Harlan Ellison.

93
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:34,791
I think, you
over-privileged kids

94
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:37,580
with your electronic tablets
and your talking phones,

95
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:41,448
wouldn't know a good piece of fiction
if your iPod read it to your ass.

96
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:43,963
I wish someone would have
come from the future,

97
00:04:43,976 --> 00:04:45,996
and warned me
not to talk to you.

98
00:04:46,011 --> 00:04:47,311
That's my idea!

99
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,992
You're stealing my idea!

100
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:50,065
Sorry.

101
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:02,885
C-B-G. What's the happs, my man?

102
00:05:02,905 --> 00:05:05,058
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Milo,

103
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:08,023
the owner of my main
competitor, Coolsville.

104
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:10,359
Or should I say,
"Foolsville."

105
00:05:10,388 --> 00:05:13,108
That is some tasty
cashish, my friend.

106
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:13,988
Indeed.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,975
And how did you
spend your evening?

108
00:05:15,994 --> 00:05:17,222
Um... Let's see.

109
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:19,157
I wrote a <i>Lost</i>
fan fiction finale

110
00:05:19,177 --> 00:05:21,855
that also answers all the
questions from <i>Twin Peaks.</i>

111
00:05:21,873 --> 00:05:24,793
Reranked all the <i>Doctor Whos
</i> by puffiness of the hair.

112
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:28,004
Oh, and I also got married
to my actual, non-imaginary,

113
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:30,813
comic-tolerating
girlfriend, Strawberry.

114
00:05:30,835 --> 00:05:34,122
Now when Milo talks to
himself, it won't seem crazy.

115
00:05:34,146 --> 00:05:36,619
So, Milo talks to himself.

116
00:05:36,646 --> 00:05:39,328
We will treasure
that information.

117
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:42,592
Yes... we will.

118
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:47,294
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna share
this primo origin ish with my <i>bride.</i>

119
00:05:47,325 --> 00:05:49,808
Even the mintiest comic
is just acidifying pulp,

120
00:05:49,828 --> 00:05:51,481
if you have no one to
read it with, right?

121
00:05:51,503 --> 00:05:53,483
Nerds don't get girls.

122
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:54,963
These days they do, man.

123
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:57,046
Comic-Con is now
eight percent women.

124
00:05:57,288 --> 00:05:58,256
STRAWBERRY:
Burn!

125
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,396
Wrong... Wrong!

126
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,306
Wro... Where is he?

127
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:06,326
Come on, buddy, I gotta get home and
climb into bed with my loving wife.

128
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:08,729
Oh, right. You have
a loving wife.

129
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:11,076
Oh. Marge and I
get along perfect.

130
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:14,651
We're like George Burns
and John Denver.

131
00:06:16,393 --> 00:06:18,027
Oh, man!

132
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,977
Carrying these kids
is hard on my back.

133
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,673
Oh...!

134
00:06:22,693 --> 00:06:24,081
Oh, yeah!

135
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:26,108
- And now to Moe's.
- Look at him. Look.

136
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:29,024
He's got family... friends.
What do I have?

137
00:06:29,037 --> 00:06:32,476
Oof. <i>Jimmy Olsen</i>
<i>vs. Matter Eater Lad.</i>

138
00:06:32,963 --> 00:06:34,990
Hm. This is better than
I remembered, actually.

139
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:37,913
No...! No it isn't!
It-It's horrible!

140
00:06:37,942 --> 00:06:38,673
(moans)

141
00:06:38,686 --> 00:06:41,292
The only thing that could make
this moment more cliched,

142
00:06:41,304 --> 00:06:43,907
is if I started to sing
about my feelings.

143
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:45,836
And... here I go.

144
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:48,658

Or, is it my imagination?

169
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:04,529
I'm your imagination.

170
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:06,646
The real Stan Lee's over there.

171
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:07,972
Excelsior!

172
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,193
But listen, as comic
book guys go,

173
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:15,358
you're trim, friendly,
and, quite a catch.

174
00:08:15,384 --> 00:08:16,229
(laughs)

175
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,733
But now... your
opportunity is knocking.

176
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:22,669
Huh...?!

177
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,710
Don't let it slip by.

178
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:28,081
- Can you help me?
- I can only watch.

179
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:30,197
I cannot interfere.

180
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:33,912
New <i>Radioactive Man
</i> number one, please.

181
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,654
Come on, nudnik.
Ask her out.

182
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:38,957
- You're interfering.
- Hey, I'm 90 years old.

183
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,668
I can do what I want.

184
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:49,699
Um... Er...
Stammer. Eh...

185
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:52,373
C-Can I sign you up for our
frequent buyer's club?

186
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:53,956
The <i>Just Us League?</i>

187
00:08:53,977 --> 00:08:57,741
You would be member number 003.
I... I am the first two.

188
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:01,162
Sure. I am Kumiko
Nakamura from Osaka.

189
00:09:01,184 --> 00:09:03,666
I am visiting America's
saddest cities,

190
00:09:03,686 --> 00:09:06,697
as research for my
autobiographical manga.

191
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:09,865
<i>Volume Six, Springfield.</i>

192
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:11,773
<i>Land of Angry Tears.</i>

193
00:09:11,808 --> 00:09:13,466
That's you.

194
00:09:14,017 --> 00:09:17,137
The man with sparkling
eyes, and zigzag beard.

195
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,208
- You have seen me before?
- Yes. Through window.

196
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:21,624
But you don't see me.

197
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:24,964
You're either looking down in
disgust, or up in disdain.

198
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:27,062
I think you have great soul.

199
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:29,721
Would you permit me to go in the
back, and do a brief inventory?

200
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,235
(muffled):
She tolerates me!

201
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,835
Ah... Is it too soon to give
you flowers in a Hulk hand?

202
00:09:37,107 --> 00:09:39,191
It is the perfect time.

203
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,069
(doorbell rings)

204
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,638
(humming happily)

205
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:43,485
Hmm?

206
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:46,267
(yelling): Bart! Your
comic vendor's here.

207
00:09:46,296 --> 00:09:48,630
Uh, actually, it is <i>you</i>
that I am here to see.

208
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:50,845
I, um, I need your help.

209
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,876
I am getting ready for a date.
(stammers)

210
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,565
The closest thing I have to a father
is the Obi-Wan doll in my store.

211
00:09:56,578 --> 00:09:58,900
And he comes from a race
of celibate knights.

212
00:09:58,922 --> 00:10:00,682
- So...
- I will help you.

213
00:10:00,703 --> 00:10:05,454
As long as our bellies never touch
again like they are right now.

214
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:06,528
BOTH:
Ew!

215
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:07,663
Oh...!

216
00:10:07,904 --> 00:10:08,997
Why pick me?

217
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,502
Because you are the only
fat man in real life

218
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:12,989
who ever got a hot woman.

219
00:10:13,008 --> 00:10:14,481
- Hey.
- Ooh... (laughs)

220
00:10:14,504 --> 00:10:16,138
Well, come in.

221
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,859
I'll explain how it all works.

222
00:10:17,892 --> 00:10:21,625
Okay. It helps if she's got a
mother she's trying to get back at.

223
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:22,845
MARGE:
Aw...

224
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,572
No woman will be able to
resist you, dressed like this.

225
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,383
Now, remember, don't be
the way you normally are

226
00:10:29,406 --> 00:10:32,039
and sustain that for
the rest of your life.

227
00:10:32,074 --> 00:10:35,654
Kumiko, uh, meet my dear friends
uh, Homer and Marge Simpson.

228
00:10:35,672 --> 00:10:37,183
I-In my country,
it is a tradition

229
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,503
to bring a much older
couple on a first date.

230
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:42,186
It is not in any way,
weird, or-or sad.

231
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:46,689
Does anyone tell you that you look
like the man on a box of Mr. Sparkle?

232
00:10:46,702 --> 00:10:49,042
<i>Aka ni taishte burei da!</i>

233
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:51,707
<i>Yogore o yaburu!</i>

234
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:55,867
In Japan, drinking your detergent
is a popular method of suicide.

235
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,696
(gasps)
<i>Honki da yo?!</i>

236
00:11:01,805 --> 00:11:05,439
Kumiko, for you, we chose the
coolest restaurant in town.

237
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,892
But the walls are
covered with garbage.

238
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,209
MARGE:
Oh...

239
00:11:10,214 --> 00:11:12,681
Not garbage, Americana.

240
00:11:15,004 --> 00:11:18,538
Here's some more Americana,
that bubbled up in the swamp.

241
00:11:18,581 --> 00:11:22,954
Here you go: Your All-American
Fifty State Potato Skin Sampler.

242
00:11:22,993 --> 00:11:25,620
Okay: Wisconsin, cheddar.

243
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:27,183
Maryland, blue crab.

244
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:29,917
They're neither in alphabetical,
nor geographical order.

245
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,967
What-What madness is this?

246
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:35,936
Please, sir. Ask your questions
after all 50 "tates."

247
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,371
I cannot hide the snide inside.

248
00:11:42,392 --> 00:11:43,919
Oh. I don't mind.

249
00:11:43,941 --> 00:11:46,888
If you think it's stupid,
say it's stupid.

250
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:47,736
Really?

251
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:50,316
In Japan, no one ever
says what they think.

252
00:11:50,347 --> 00:11:52,420
We know our game
shows are degrading

253
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:54,483
and our baseball
fences are too close.

254
00:11:54,511 --> 00:11:56,225
But no one says anything.

255
00:11:56,251 --> 00:11:56,878
(gasps)

256
00:11:56,898 --> 00:11:58,871
Attention, restaurateurs!
(diners murmuring)

257
00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:00,871
You should've spent
less on the kitsch,

258
00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:02,874
and more on
the kitch-en.

259
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:05,634
With this bowl of
Chuck's Cherokee Salsa,

260
00:12:05,653 --> 00:12:09,146
I baptize you mediocre, at best.

261
00:12:09,165 --> 00:12:10,079
(laughs)

262
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,737
American nerd snark is
the finest in the world.

263
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:16,478
Let's go walking and
mocking in the rain.

264
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:17,701
I'm in love!

265
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:19,921
And, yet, still
a little bitter.

266
00:12:20,054 --> 00:12:21,653
It-It's surprising.

267
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,753
(Japanese pop song
"Ponponpon" playing)

268
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:36,410
JIM-JAM BONKS: Father,
why-sa you-sa forsake-a me-sa?

269
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,305
♪

270
00:12:52,102 --> 00:12:53,571
(applause)

271
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,699
Marge, Homer, you have
nurtured our love

272
00:12:59,723 --> 00:13:03,636
like Steven Speilberg nurtured the
careers of Zemeckis and Gale.

273
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:04,662
(sympathetically):
Oh...

274
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:07,794
So, we want you to know, I
have decided to move in

275
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,597
to the basement
under his store.

276
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,470
At last, we'll be
in the same bed.

277
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:13,308
Just like Batman and Robin.

278
00:13:13,362 --> 00:13:14,912
- HOMER: Ohh...
- MARGE: Hmm...

279
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,718
Homer, I want you
to take Kumiko

280
00:13:18,737 --> 00:13:21,105
and Comic Book Guy a
housewarming present,

281
00:13:21,123 --> 00:13:22,516
and maybe check in on them?

282
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:24,177
We talked about this, Marge.

283
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:26,480
The hammock is a
chore-free zone.

284
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:30,313
Apparently, including tying
the knots on the hammock.

285
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:35,379
And getting the termites
out of the trees.

286
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,426
(squeaking)

287
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,801
Not a word.

288
00:13:41,558 --> 00:13:43,299
(Japanese accent):
Excuse me, sir.

289
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,333
I am looking for my daughter.

290
00:13:45,355 --> 00:13:49,616
I thought this was her residence, but
all I see is a store full of, uh,

291
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:51,576
non-pornographic manga.

292
00:13:51,594 --> 00:13:54,007
(gasps)
You're Kumiko's father?

293
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:55,809
Welcome, sensei.

294
00:13:55,832 --> 00:13:57,539
I am not a Kung fu instructor.

295
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,106
I am a humble salary man
who could kick your ass.

296
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,091
Say, has anyone told
you you look like...

297
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:04,303
I know. Mr. Sparkle.

298
00:14:04,316 --> 00:14:07,343
I was going to say, like
you're going to have a stroke.

299
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,137
(laughs)

300
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:09,544
I get that a lot too.

301
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:12,213
Now, please,
where is my daughter?

302
00:14:12,248 --> 00:14:14,697
Okay. She moved in
with her boyfriend.

303
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:18,187
Well, he's not a boy. He's immature.
But, fat and old.

304
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:22,433
So, an obese nerd has stolen my
daughter to live in his basement?

305
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,598
- I didn't tell you about the basement.
- It was an obvious guess!

306
00:14:25,628 --> 00:14:26,741
(bell dings)

307
00:14:26,757 --> 00:14:27,988
(crying)

308
00:14:29,484 --> 00:14:31,915
Daughter! You are
coming back to Japan!

309
00:14:31,941 --> 00:14:35,672
There are 87 old people who
need you to take care of them.

310
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:38,218
No. Please... Please. I
was becoming cuddly.

311
00:14:38,247 --> 00:14:40,689
I deleted rants from my blog.

312
00:14:40,716 --> 00:14:43,635
You can retrieve rants if you
did not empty your trash.

313
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:44,746
Goodbye!

314
00:14:52,106 --> 00:14:53,849
Now I know I've got a heart...

315
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:55,502
because it's breaking.

316
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:57,216
<i>Wizard of Oz</i> reference!

317
00:14:57,658 --> 00:14:58,791
Did I do that?

318
00:14:58,813 --> 00:15:00,301
Urkle reference!

319
00:15:00,347 --> 00:15:01,714
(panting)
Help me.

320
00:15:01,782 --> 00:15:02,915
<i>Fire</i> reference!

321
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,623
(panting): I can't stop.
I can't stop.

322
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,926
Homer Simpson, this was your
doing. And I want you to fix it.

323
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,862
I have a bad feeling about this!

324
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,969
Every action movie
ever made reference!

325
00:15:12,993 --> 00:15:14,074
Now!

326
00:15:16,308 --> 00:15:18,921
Yeah, Homer. We have
much in common.

327
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:22,668
We both love our daughters,
and discipline our sons.

328
00:15:22,696 --> 00:15:26,950
No... discipline would imply,
I'm trying to make him better.

329
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,382
So... are you married?

330
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:29,104
(sighs)

331
00:15:29,131 --> 00:15:31,250
My dear Michiko
has passed away.

332
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,584
But she's always with me.

333
00:15:33,614 --> 00:15:35,861
You promise double suicide.

334
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:37,555
You hear what you want to hear.

335
00:15:38,112 --> 00:15:39,931
<i>Always</i> with me.

336
00:15:39,954 --> 00:15:42,133
Another drink!
Something stronger!

337
00:15:43,731 --> 00:15:44,834
(creaks)

338
00:15:49,576 --> 00:15:51,746
JAPANESE BARTENDER (dramatically):
Snake rice wine.

339
00:15:51,765 --> 00:15:53,428
Now, that's disgusting.

340
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,008
Wine made of rice?

341
00:15:58,979 --> 00:15:59,912
Try some.

342
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:00,980
<i>Hai.</i>

343
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:05,404
(hissing)

344
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:06,499
(Homer slurring drunkenly)

345
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,029
(Mr. Nakamura drunkenly laughs)

346
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:12,193
(slurring): Why didn't I
stop with the snake wine?

347
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:14,903
Why did I drink the fish wine?

348
00:16:14,921 --> 00:16:16,685
That was the aquarium.

349
00:16:16,723 --> 00:16:18,758
(quiet, gentle melody plays)

350
00:16:24,204 --> 00:16:25,797
(engine humming)

351
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:27,940

thoughts, on this blessed occasion?

Yes. (clears throat) I-I-I
would like to say something.

00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,080
Um, since I met Kumiko,

410
00:19:35,114 --> 00:19:38,520
strangely, comic books no
longer seem so important.

411
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:40,738
I will also be selling
greeting cards.

412
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,499
