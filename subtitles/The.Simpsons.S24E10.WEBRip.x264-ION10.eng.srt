174
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,129
-It's Bart.
-(all groaning)

175
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:51,132
I have an aunt named Hope.
Perhaps you'd like to kill her as well.

176
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,763
Bart will take his exam
first thing tomorrow morning.

177
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,715
Bart, I'm begging you to try and study.

178
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,556
When I think begging,
I don't imagine someone standing up.

179
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,772
Sorry, I can't grant a favor

180
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,773
to someone
I don't respect anymore.

181
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,185
You can spin in my chair!

182
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,284
Whee!

183
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,449
Spinner! Slow down.

184
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,038
(chuckles)

185
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,503
Well, sure the Lord wouldn't
have placed his meter there

186
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,211
if he didn't want me to park.

187
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,301
This is the easiest money I've ever made.

188
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,970
Lugging around a 90-pound parking meter.

189
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,057
It's not that kind.

190
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:48,772
All right, now to drag
the meter to the next idiot.

191
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,936
Oh, God, my back.

192
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,605
(laughing) Suckers.

193
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,704
Oh, my disks are grinding.

194
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,451
(laughing)

195
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,953
Easy money. (grunting)

196
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,996
<i>♪ Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes ♪</i>

197
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,130
<i>♪ Turn and face</i>
<i>the strange ch-ch-changes ♪</i>

198
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,209
<i>♪ Don't wanna be a richer man ♪</i>

199
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,545
<i>♪ Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes ♪</i>

200
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:17,591

201
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,597

202
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,061
(laughing)

203
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,270
Thanks for the freedom of speech, dorks.

204
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,441
(whistling)

205
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,360
Uh, we're cool, right, boy?

206
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,518
Nothing a few George Washingtons
won't solve.

207
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,357
(chuckles, grunts)

208
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:38,203
Now, to sleep the sleep of the just.

209
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,200
(sighs)

210
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,625
Godspeed, old chum.

211
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,263
Pass the test
and your lunch money is yours.

212
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,970
I'm a kid you've never seen,
and I speak for all

213
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,431
the kids you've never seen.

214
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,346
Do it, man, or you'll never see us again.

215
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,937
Principal Skinner, could you help me
sharpen this pencil?

216
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,520
I guess a little circular
grinding might relax me.

217
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,614
I can't do this. I'm not ready.

218
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,033
You really didn't study?

219
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,991
Well, I slept on my books,

220
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,701
so I might have gotten
something through osmosis.

221
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,701
So, you know what osmosis is?

222
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,543
Uh, pajamas?

223
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,908
Let me make this crystal
clear to you, Simpson.

224
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,536
If you don't pass this test,

225
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,622
it will destroy the school.

226
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,087
(laughing)

227
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,524
Our entire school riding on that
coffee can head of yours.

228
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,559
We've got to get you
more time to study.

229
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,482
But how?

230
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,351
Pull the fire alarm.

231
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,058
I'd do it, but everyone's looking at me.

232
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:01,155
What to do, what to do?

233
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,658
Don't do it, Seymour.

234
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,700
You've never broken school rules. Ever.

235
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,124
You wimp.

236
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,081
(alarm ringing)

237
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,748
Children, remain calm,
find your disaster buddy,

238
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,384
which is different from your lab partner

239
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,551
but may be the same
as your lunchroom buddy.

240
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,260
BART: Well, well, well...

241
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,928
Looks like Mr. Vanilla
just grew some chocolate chips.

242
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:27,601
Save your analogies for the
analogy portion of the exam.

243
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,181
I bought you time, boy. Don't blow it.

244
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:33,437
I won't. I'm going to ignore everything
else on my schedule.

245
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,437
{\an8}Pass this test and the eggs are on me.

246
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,355
They will be, Seymour. They will be.

247
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,616
(laughing)

248
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,618
I'm king of the bus station.

249
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,540
<i>Meter, meter, quarter cheater?</i>

250
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,211
A rogue parking meter has been
terrorizing the streets.

251
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,670
Experts estimate the cost
to taxpayers at north of $50.

252
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,922
That's right, Kent.

253
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,843
The entire force is on
the lookout for anyone

254
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,132
with an excessive amount of change.

255
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,177
Our top criminologists have a theory

256
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,721
as to what the suspect
just might look like.

257
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,925
But, of course,
that question mark could be

258
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,515
an exclamation point or an interrobang.

259
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,600
And the man or woman could be Hispanic or,

260
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:19,147
most frightening,
contain no punctuation at all.

261
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,823
(whimpers)

262
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,699
So, how's the studying going?

263
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,036
When I start I'll tell you.

264
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,206
This is the most selfish thing
you've ever done.

265
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,922
You're letting your friends
go hang because you

266
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,633
are lazy and selfish and, hey,
are you falling asleep

267
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,965
just to spite me?

268
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,562
Hey, why aren't you eating that?

269
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,812
There's four of us and eight slices.

270
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,725
We don't know how to divide it.

271
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:01,823
Something Stu forgot the music he loves.

272
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,991
Mrs. Krabappel?
Are you a teacher of the night?

273
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,951
Ha, I wish I was a hooker.

274
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,662
No one in this town has any money.

275
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,412
But the worst thing is what's
happened to the school.

276
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,334
No, no!

277
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,753
(all grumbling)

278
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,955
(groans) What have I done?

279
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,884
Spinach farm, huh?

280
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,756
That's right, you talk in your sleep.

281
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,473
Lisa, I want to pass that test.

282
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,934
But I need your help.

283
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,024
I have all sorts of problems:

284
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,849
Lack of attention, I'm afraid of ovals,

285
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,595
I only know 24 letters.

286
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,436
Don't you fall asleep on me.

287
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,821
Excuse me, you're that proctor

288
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,452
that's shutting down my children's school.

289
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,029
I don't shut anything down.

290
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,914
People cut their own heads,

291
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,531
and I just tip 'em into the basket.

292
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:56,368
You've been in public education
a long time, haven't you?

293
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,799
(grunting)

294
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,465
Freeze, Jack Nickel-scum.

295
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,055
Wha...?

296
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,980
You know what they do
to parking meter thieves in prison?

297
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,980
They probably treat 'em pretty well.

298
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,022
But when you get out,
you're not eligible for jury duty.

299
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,977
Which, again, sounds pretty good.

300
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,822
Eat silver, copper.

301
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:29,914
D'oh!

302
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,199
(tires screeching)

303
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,245
Stay with me, man. Stay with me.

304
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,214
No, no!

305
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,962
You're the first successful
business I've ever run.

306
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,051
It's hopeless.

307
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,303
I can't make up for ten years
of goofing off in one day.

308
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,965
I need two days.

309
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:56,063
Look, the thing is,
it's more important to know

310
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,310
how to take a test
than knowing what's on it.

311
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,982
So do the ones you know first.

312
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,270
If you don't know one,
guess "B" and move on.

313
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,574
Now, what is the capital of Massachusetts?

314
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,689
Uh, "B"?

315
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,026
Very good.

316
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,412
(ticking)

317
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:19,122
<i>BART: Okay, this is it. Do or die.</i>

318
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,544
D'oh. Will you stop that?

319
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,882
(tapping)

320
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,209
Burly Paper Towels, Burlyville, Minnesota.

321
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,046
Dear Sir or Madam:

322
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:33,091
Your paper towel packets
promised 102 sheets of towels.

323
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,097
But I was blessed to receive 103.

324
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,100
I'm returning the extra towel, unused...

325
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,482
-(jingling)
-Hmm?

326
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,559
A pillow case full of quarters?

327
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,515
Where did you get that money?

328
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,396
And what have you done with the pillows?

329
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,073
The pillows are safe at my workstation.

330
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,702
As for the quarters, well,

331
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,319
I'm ashamed to tell you what I did.

332
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,116
How long have you been in there?

333
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,908
Well, we're going to turn this change

334
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,167
-into change for the better.
-Whoo-hoo!

335
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,629
And I wish that Mr. Teeny gets a banana,

336
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,920
that the Isotopes emerge from this season
with a great blooper reel.

337
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,375
I wish that wishing wells worked

338
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,125
so I wasn't tossing my money away,

339
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,638
and that Marge loves me forever

340
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,220
no matter what stupid things I do.

341
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,138
(grunts)

342
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,596
(splash)

343
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:27,185
And I hope Bart passes his test
and saves the school.

344
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,822
Way to get us back on topic, Marge.

345
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,526
<i>If you have to guess, guess "B."</i>

346
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,250
-Not every question!
-(groans)

347
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,000
The second that boy fails,
we're knocking down this school.

348
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,714
Please have a little faith.

349
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,174
I hear you, Seymour.

350
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,924
Start the upswing!

351
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:59,009
The least common blood type is A) B,

352
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,596
B) A, C) AB,

353
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,272
-D) O... D'oh!
-Ten more seconds.

354
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,414
(buzzer)

355
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,124
And the last answer, "C"...

356
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:26,043
is correct.

357
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,043
Congratulations, you made it by one.

358
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,996
{\an8}That'll do, bug, that'll do.

359
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,916
{\an8}<i>(Superman</i> theme
by John Williams playing)

360
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,886
-He passed.
-Stop that ball!

361
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,311
Now your mom can see you
work from her house.

362
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,480
Seymour, stop slouching!

363
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:56,696
I'm not sure if you gave
my son any extra help,

364
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,068
but if you did, thank you.

365
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:02,026
Perhaps this was a test of my humanity.

366
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,827
A test I like to think I passed.

367
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:09,002
Would you like to have coffee
or dinner, or just talk?

368
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:12,092
None of the above.

369
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,669
Testward ho!

370
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,472
(wind blowing)

371
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,766
(growls)

372
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,231
Is this Wilson Elementary?

373
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,021
-No.
-Sorry.

374
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,159
Shh!
