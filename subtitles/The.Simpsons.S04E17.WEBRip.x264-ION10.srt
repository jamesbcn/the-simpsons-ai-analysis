{\an8}that union representative?
He's 20 minutes late.

34
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,730
I don't know, sir.
He hasn't been seen

35
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,521
since he promised
to clean up the union.

36
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,609
Oh!

37
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,900
What the hell?

38
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:31,904
Well, let's look

39
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,145
at the contract
ourselves, eh?

40
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,907
Benefits, perks,

41
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,119

St. Patrick's Day. Ho ho.

42
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,080
It didn't use
to be this way, Smithers.

43
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,001
No, it didn't use
to be this way at all.

44
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,626
Come on, come on,
crack those atoms.

45
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,177
You, turn out
those pockets.

46
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,311
Atoms. One, two,
three, fo...

47
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,430
six of them.

48
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,137
Take him away.

49
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,767
You can't treat
the working man this way.

50
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,024
One day we'll form a union,

51
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,686
and get the fair and equitable
treatment we deserve.

52
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,985
Then we'll go too far,
and get corrupt and shiftless,

53
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,280
and the Japanese
will eat us alive.

54
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,534
The Japanese?

55
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,366
Those sandal-wearing
goldfish tenders?

56
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,452
Ha ha! Bosh. Flimshaw.

57
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,165
If only we had listened
to that boy

58
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,550
instead of walling him up
in the abandoned coke oven.

59
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,009
Well, I am going
to avenge my grandfather.

60
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,470
We'll take
on that greedy union

61
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,721
and we'll get back our...

62
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,390
dental plan.

63
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,479
How often do you brush, Ralph?

64
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,074
Three times a day, sir.

65
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:57,069
Why must you turn my office
into a house of lies?

66
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,363
You're right, I don't brush.

67
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,906
I don't brush.

68
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,120
Let's look at a picture book.

69
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,679
That's enough!
That's enough!

70
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:22,008
Dr. Wolfe likes to pull kids'
teeth so he can sell them.

71
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,345
To who?

72
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,639
Know that rattle
when you shake up spray paint?

73
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,933
That's a kid's tooth.

74
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,347
(whimpering)

75
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,895
Maggie's teeth are coming
in crooked.

76
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,443
Has she been sucking
on a pacifier?

77
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,397
Um, not to my knowledge.

78
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,357
Liar!

79
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,912
I'm also afraid

80
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,162
little Lisa is going
to need braces.

81
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,754
Oh, no. I'll be
socially unpopular.

82
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,041
More so.

83
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,294
Are you sure, doctor?

84
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,205
Well, judge for yourself.

85
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,344
Here's Lisa today.

86
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,341
Without treatment,
here's what she'll look like

87
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,093
at age 11...

88
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,144
age 14...

89
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,888
age 17...

90
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,520
and finally, age 18.

91
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,558
(gasps)

92
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,061
Cool. She'll be a freak.

93
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,154
Bart!

94
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,148
We can stick
her in a trailer,

95
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,309
drive around the south,

96
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,107
and charge
two bits a gander.

102
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,963
I hope they kill
that Iron Yuppie.

103
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,289
Thinks he's so big.

104
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,133
Homer, Lisa needs braces.

105
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,669
Don't worry.

106
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,763
We won a dental plan
in the strike of '88.

107
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,918
That's where I got this scar.

108
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,547
What do we want?

109
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,303
ALL: More equitable treatment
in the hands of management!

110
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,386
When do we want it?

111
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,601
ALL: Soon!

112
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,270
Where's my burrito?!

113
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,349
Where's my burrito?!

114
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,814
Where's my burrito?!

115
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,314
Ow!

116
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,395
Then I got this scar
sneaking under the door

117
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,151
of a pay toilet.

118
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,607
CARL: Welcome brothers
of local 643.

119
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,616
As you know, our president,
Chucky Fitzhugh,

120
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,328
ain't been seen lately.

121
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,948
We're all praying he'll
turn up soon, alive and well.

122
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,536
(derisive laughter)

123
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,122
All right, all right,
but seriously...

124
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,997
we have to vote
on Burns' new contract.

125
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,634
It's basically the same deal,

126
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,920
except we get a free keg
of beer for our meetings.

127
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,014
(cheers)

128
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,299
And in exchange for that,

129
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,182
we have to give up
our dental plan.

130
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,060
So long, dental plan.

144

If we give up
our dental plan...

145
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,507
I'll have to pay
for Lisa's braces!

146
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,969
People, stop! We can't
give up our dental plan.

147
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,801
Lenny, without
that dental plan,

148
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,926
you wouldn't have that
diamond in your tooth.

149
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,141
Yoink!

150
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,314
Hey!

151
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,062
And Gummy Joe.

152
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,404
Where would you be
without that dental plan?

153
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,399
{\an8}(Walter Brennan voice)
I wouldn't have old chomper here

154
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,361
{\an8}that's for sure.

155
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,069
You know what I think
of this contract? This!

156
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,236
(growling, straining)

157
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,709
Who is that firebrand,
Smithers?

158
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,331
That's Homer Simpson, sir.

159
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,248
Simpson, eh? New man?

160
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,126
Actually sir, he thwarted
your campaign for governor.

161
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,724
You ran over his son.

162
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,299
He saved the plant
from meltdown.

163
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,604
His wife painted you
in the nude.

164
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,258
Uh, doesn't ring a bell.

165
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,227
(chanting)
Homer! Homer! Homer!

166
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,309
I move that Homer Simpson
be our new union president.

167
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,685
All in favor?

168
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,861
ALL: Aye!

169
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,019
All opposed?

170
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,397
MAN (with nebbish
voice): Nay.

171
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,784

174
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,407
Nothing.

176
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,365
Whoo-hoo!!

177
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:20,997
President of the union!
I'm so proud of you, Homie.

178
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,173
This is your chance
to get a fair shake

179
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,171
for the working man.

180
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:28,053
And make lifelong connections
to the world of organized crime.

181
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,682
Mmm, organized crime.

182
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,727
Don Homer, I have baked
a special doughnut

183
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,980
just for you.

184
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,692
Mmm.

185
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,234
<i>Grazie.</i>

186
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,993
Don Homer, my son, he has
trouble with the, uh...

187
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,873
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh...

188
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,286
<i>Molto bene.</i>

189
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,001
That's-a nice-a doughnut.

190
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,504
Do you think you can get
the dental plan back?

191
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,756
Well, that depends on
who's a better negotiator--

192
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,628
Mr. Burns or me.

193
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,715
Dad, I'll trade you
this delicious doorstop

194
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,012
for your crummy
old Danish.

195
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,425
Done, and done.

196
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,644
(chuckling)

197
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,393
D'oh!

198
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,806
Lisa and Marge,

199
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,564
these braces
are invisible, painless,

200
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,186
and periodically release
a delightful burst

201
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,904
of Calvin Klein's
Obsession for teeth.

202
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:30,989
(sniffs)

203
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,570
Mmm!

204
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:36,445
Doctor, we don't have
a dental plan right now

205
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,794
so we'll need something
a little more... affordable.

206
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,170
These predate stainless steel,
so you can't get them wet.

207
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,036
(coughs)

208
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,011
He's a worthy foe.

209
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,969
Look at him, Smithers--
Exercising away

210
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,010
while the others are off
at the candy machine.

211
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,604
(grunting)

212
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,220
Hey, Lenny, can you get

213
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,477
this Sugar Daddy
off my back?

214
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,599
Okay, but it's
the last time.

215
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,980
We don't have
to be adversaries, Homer.

216
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,447
We both want
a fair union contract.

217
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,028
HOMER: <i>Why is Mr. Burns</i>
<i>being so nice to me?</i>

218
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,874
And if you scratch my back,
I'll scratch yours.

219
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,621
{\an8}<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>Is he coming on to me?</i>

220
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,374
I mean, if I should slip
something into your pocket,

221
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,667
what's the harm?

222
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,710
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

223
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,252
<i>He is coming on to me.</i>

224
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:32,166
After all, negotiations
make strange bedfellows.

225
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,296
(snickers)

226
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,682
(clicks tongue)

227
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,679
<i>Ahh!</i>

228
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,390
Sorry, Mr. Burns,

229
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,640
but I don't go in for these
backdoor shenanigans.

230
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,312
Sure, I'm flattered,
maybe even a little curious,

231
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,931
but the answer is no.

232
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,598
(sighs)

233
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,266
Lisa, so you won't be scared,

234
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,185
I'll show you some
of the tools I'll be using.

235
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,114
This is the scraper,

236
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,863
this is the poker,

237
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:57,664
and this happy little fellow
is the gouger.

238
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,159
Uh-huh.

239
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,242
Now, the first thing
I'll be doing

240
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,288
is chiseling some teeth
out of your jawbone.

241
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,253
Hold still while I gas you.

242
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,416
('60s music playing)

243
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,278
(cockney accent)
Look, fellas.

244
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,951
It's Lisa in the sky.

245
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,449
No diamonds, though.

246
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,451
Look out for the campy drawing
of Queen Victoria!

247
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,124
All: Oh, no!

248
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,622
For the love of God,
help us!

249
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,754
-Help us!
-Help us!

250
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,495
The mirror.

251
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,300
The mirror!

252
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,971
(evil cackling)

253
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,305
Honey, you look fine.

254
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,483
(barking)

255
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,765
(yelping)

256
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,742
(doorbell rings)

257
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,148
Who is it?

258
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,196
MAN: Goons.

259
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,199
HOMER: Who?

260
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,360
Hired goons.

261
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,488
Hired goons?

262
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,082
(sinister laughing)

263
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:38,088
Ah, Homer. I hope Crusher
and Low Blow didn't hurt you.

264
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,434
You know, you could
have just called me.

265
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,719
Oh, yes, but the telephone
is so impersonal.

266
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,973
I prefer the hands-on touch

267
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,925
you only get
with hired goons.

268
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,726
Hired goons?

269
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,519
This is the largest TV
in the free world.

270
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,569
<i>Aiee! Un gato malodoro!</i>

271
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,532
(shivering groan)

272
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,410
This is a thousand monkeys

273
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,242
working at a
thousand typewriters.

274
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,867
Soon, they'll have written

275
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,673
the greatest novel
known to man. Let's see.

276
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:15,419
"It was the best of times,
it was the blurst of times!"

277
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,213
-You stupid monkey!
-(chattering)

278
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,507
Oh, shut up.

279
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,550
(footsteps trudging)

280
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,345
And this
is my basement.

281
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,389
Gee, it's not as nice
as the other rooms.

282
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,063
Yes, I really should stop

283
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,181
ending the tour
with it.

284
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,154
Now, let's get down
to business.

285
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,609
HOMER: <i>Oh, man,</i>

286
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,568
<i>I really have to go</i>
<i>to the bathroom.</i>

287
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,239
<i>Why did I have all that beer</i>
<i>and coffee and watermelon?</i>

288
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,068
Now, Homer, I know
what you're thinking,

289
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,243
and I want to take
the pressure off.

290
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,282
It doesn't take a whiz to see

291
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,696
that you're looking out
for number one.

292
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,914
Well, listen to me
and you'll make

293
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,624
a big splash very soon.

294
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,714
Which way to the bathroom?

295
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,540
Oh, it's the 23rd door
on the left.

296
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,995
Nope.

297
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,335
Nope.

298
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,299
Nope.

299
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,009
Ah, he wouldn't even
hear me out.

300
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,510
(grunting)

301
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,011
Find the bathroom
all right?

302
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,763
Uh... yeah.

303
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,767
Well, you've won
this round, Simpson.

304
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,435
But I'll grind you
into the earth like a bug.

305
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,194
(maniacal laughing)

306
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,566
(screaming)

307
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,697
{\an8}Simpson, be a dear
and rub my legs

308
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,200
{\an8}till the feeling
comes back.

309
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,698
A bug, I tell you!

310
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,164
A bug!

311
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,004
(maniacal laughter)

312
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,000
(groans)

313
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,131
(sighs)
I'm going to resign.

314
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,378
I don't know why they made
me union president

315
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,630
in the first place.

316
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,172
Because they love you
down at the plant.

317
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,716
Yeah, you're right.

318
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,719
Guys are always patting
my bald head for luck,

319
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,562
pinching my belly to
hear my girlish laugh.

320
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,388
Hmm. That doesn't sound like
they like you at all.

321
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,564
You know,
I think you're right.

322
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,062
First thing tomorrow morning,

323
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,024
I'm going to punch Lenny
in the back of the head.

324
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,064
Hmm. (grunts)

325
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,858
Batten down those cowlicks.

326
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,704
Straighten that part.

327
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,409
Uncross those eyes,
mister.

328
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,449
But I can't!

329
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,122
Oh, sorry, Quigley.

330
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,750
Come on, honey, smile.

331
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,658
I bet you've got
a beautiful smile.

332
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,668
Why don't you share it
with the world?

333
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,752
(gasping)
There is no God!

334
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,671
Fellow workers,
I've been meeting

335
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,967
with Mr. Burns day and night
and I've had enough.

336
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,011
(chanting)
Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!

337
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,554
All in favor of a strike?

338
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,558
ALL: Aye!

339
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,559
All opposed?

340
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,640
MAN (with nebbish
voice): Nay.

341
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,064
Who keeps saying that?

342
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,939
(nebbish voice)
It was him.

343
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,901
Let's get him,
fellas.

344
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,981

345
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,608
(chuckling)

346
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,158

Ah, this is the life.

Smithers, get me
some strikebreakers.

358
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,685
The kind they had
in the '30s.

359
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,284
We can't bust heads
like we used to.

360
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,200
But we have our ways.

361
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,198
(murmuring in agreement)

362
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,240
One trick is to tell
them stories

363
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,244
that don't go anywhere.

364
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,406
Like the time I caught
the ferry over to Shelbyville.

365
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,576
I needed a new heel
for my shoe,

366
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,246
so I decided to go
to Morganville,

367
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,586
which is what they called
Shelbyville in those days.

368
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,093
So I tied an onion to my belt,

369
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,215
which was the style
at the time.

370
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:55,102
Now, to take the ferry
costs a nickel,

371
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,810
and in those days,

372
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,060
nickels had pictures
of bumblebees on them.

373
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,944
"Give me five bees
for a quarter," you'd say.

374
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,192
Now, where were we?

375
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,283
Oh, yeah.
The important thing was

376
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,069
that I had
an onion on my belt,

377
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,493
which was the style
at the time.

378
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,742
They didn't have
white onions

379
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,334
because of the war.

380
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,079
The only thing
you could get

381
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,001
was those big,
yellow ones.

382
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,909
(shouting angrily)

383
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,368
Full power, Smithers.

384
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,004

Now do "Classical Gas".

390
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,941
(playing "Classical Gas")

391
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,750
Ooh, look at him strutting around
like he's cock of the walk.

392
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,923
Well, let me tell you.

393
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,091
Homer Simpson
is cock of nothing.

394
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,210
Hmm?

395
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,376
Why, you and I can run
this plant ourselves.

396
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,086
(upbeat music playing)

397
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,128
ROBOTS: Crush, kill, destroy.

398
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,340
Tonight on Smartline:

399
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,170
"The Power Plant Strike--
Argle-bargle or Foofooraw?"

400
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,417
With us tonight

401
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,388
are plant owner
C.M. Burns,

402
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,598
union kingpin
Homer Simpson,

403
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,759
and talk show mainstay
Dr. Joyce brothers.

404
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,428
I brought my own mic.

405
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,096
Yes, well...

406
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,864
Homer, organized labor has been
called a lumbering dinosaur.

407
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:08,768
(screams)

408
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,726
Uh, my director's telling me

409
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,436
not to talk to you anymore.

410
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,396
-Whoo-hoo!
-Uh, Mr. Burns,

411
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,446
you mentioned you wanted
an opening tirade?

412
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,610
Yes, thank you, Kent.

413
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,198
15 minutes from now,

414
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,163
I will wreak a terrible
vengeance on this city.

415
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,204
No one will be spared!

416
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,078
No one!

417
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,285
(chuckles)
A chilling vision of things to come.

418
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,114
Oh, for God's sake.

419
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,403
(whines)

420
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,108
Good-bye, Springfield.

421
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,118
From hell's heart,
I stab at thee.

422

through the darkness
I'm bringing.

432
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,538
They're not sad at all.
They're actually singing.

433
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,294
They sing without juicers.

434
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,285
They sing without blenders.

435
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:58,418
They sing without flunjers,
capdabblers, and smendlers.

436

Dooh...

437

Tell Simpson
I'm ready to deal.

438
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,639
All right, Homer.

439
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,560
You can have the dental plan

440
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,469
on one condition.

441
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,347
You must resign
as head of the union.

Smithers, I'm beginning
to think that Homer Simpson

445
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,857
was not the brilliant
tactician I thought he was.
