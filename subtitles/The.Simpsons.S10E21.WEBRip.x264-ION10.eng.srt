00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,105
D'oh! (screams)

00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,366

00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,349
ANNOUNCER: <i>And welcome back now</i>

13
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,943
<i>to </i>Cash In Your Legacy <i>.</i>

14
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:45,358
<i>This week we're appraising</i>
<i>antiques in Springfield.</i>

15
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,938
{\an8}<i>This gentlemen's beer tap</i>

16
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,733
{\an8}<i>dates back to the turn of the century,</i>

17
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,527
{\an8}<i>and remarkably seems</i>
<i>to never have been washed.</i>

18
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,611
{\an8}<i>Yeah, yeah,</i>
<i>I've been meaning to wash that,</i>

19
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,656
{\an8}<i>but, huh, it's been such a century.</i>

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,290
{\an8}<i>At auction, I'd expect this</i>
<i>to bring $20,000 to $30,000,</i>

21
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,459
{\an8}<i>except that on the handle,</i>
<i>somebody's carved "Homer rocks."</i>

22
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,459
{\an8}And I do! Whoo!

23
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,748
{\an8}<i>Appraised value, $15.</i>

24
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,335
{\an8}<i>I-I'm gonna kill him! I'm gonna kill him!</i>

25
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,050
(grunts) <i>Aw, geez.</i>

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,430
{\an8}I don't know how you can all
just lay around the house

27
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,969
{\an8}on a nice day like this.

28
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:20,008
{\an8}When was the last time we went for a good,
old-fashioned family walk?

29
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,978
{\an8}Oh, we stopped those when the kids said

30
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,728
{\an8}I was too fat to carry.

31
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,310
{\an8}Oh, come on, let's go for a walk.

32
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,896
{\an8}This family's getting so lazy.

33
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,324
{\an8}I'm not lazy.

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,240
{\an8}I'm just, um, uh...

35
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,698
{\an8}Lisa, finish my sentence for me.

36
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,280
{\an8}Why don't you finish your own darn...

37
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,196
{\an8}-(snoring)
-(thud)

38
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,115
{\an8}Fine! If we're not going for a walk,

39
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,083
{\an8}we'll just talk about our day.

40
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,464
{\an8}I wrote another poem about a duck.

41
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,999
{\an8}Can't we go home yet? My feet hurt!

42
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,797
{\an8}All this fresh air is making my hair move,

43
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,552
{\an8}and I don't know
how much longer I can complain.

44
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,764
{\an8}(tires screeching)

45
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,014
{\an8}Get a horse!

46
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,472
{\an8}Could we, Marge? Could we get a horse?

47
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,766
{\an8}We're walking, Homer.

48
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,349
{\an8}(groans) There's some dogs.

49
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,604
{\an8}We could all ride dogs.

50
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,225
Forget it! Nobody's riding any.

51
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,482
Hi-yo, Silver. Away!

52
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,074
-(dog whimpers)
-(thud)

53
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:16,401
{\an8}Oh, look! There's the store
where I buy my yarn.

54
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,566
But you don't want to buy
your buttons there.

55
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,327
Phew! Well, I dodged a bullet.

56
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,289
Now, there's the place
you want to buy your buttons.

57
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,420
And that's where the bookmobile lady
used to live.

58
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,826
{\an8}If you love me, you'll kill me.

59
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,208
Hey, Mom. Look.

60
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,256
MARGE: Oh! looks like
something exciting's happening.

61
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,429
Well, we'll have to read
about it in tomorrow's paper.

62
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,138
{\an8}Why can't we see it now?

63
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,809
Well, it's not really
on our walking route.

64
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,597
(grunts)

65
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,848
Where'd you get that champagne?

66
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,978
Clown.

67
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,687
Thanks, noodles.

68
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,605
All this commotion just for a store?

69
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,954
Hey, it's not just a store.
It's a megastore.

70
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,451
"Mega" means "good"
and "store" means "thing."

71
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,372
(gasping)

72
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,507
Wow, what a high-tech wonderland.

73
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,628
Oops, got an itch.

74
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,506
-Itch.
-Ew!

75
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,763
Whoa, this place has everything.

76
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,675
Even a shoplifting department.

77
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,354
{\an8}What convenience.

78
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,432
{\an8}I'm doing all my thieving here.

79
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,020
This is so much nicer
than the Kwik-E-Mart.

80
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,515
-Oh?
-(baby cooing)

81
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,777
I'm sorry, but... it really is.

82
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,196
Yes, I know, but still.

83
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,610
(baby cooing)

84
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,659
{\an8}Hey, Dad. Give me 50 bucks.
I gotta buy some things.

85
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,833
{\an8}-Uh, better make it 100.
-Yeah, me, too.

86
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,286
Homer, don't you think
you're spoiling... (chuckles)

87
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,835
(blowing raspberry) New music?

88
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,260
Man, all these bands are
just ripping off Judas Priest.

89
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,880
("Living After Midnight"
playing on headphones)

90
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,967
Oh, I hear this really sucks.

91
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,680
Hmm, "director's commentary."

92
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,885
<i>I'm sorry. I am really sorry.</i>

93
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,266
<i>Ach, uh, I don't know what I was thinking.</i>

94
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,613
<i>But, uh, </i>Field of Dreams
<i>was good, wasn't it?</i>

95
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,439
<i>Made us all believe again.</i>

96
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:20,034
Oh, poor Mr. Costner. He tries so hard.

97
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,031
<i>Aw, thanks. You're sweet to say that.</i>

98
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:25,123
Uh... where are you?

99
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,239
<i>I'm back here.</i>

100
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,996
Hi, will you bring me
a sandwich... please?

101
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,198
No-no crust.

102
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:42,088
(all screaming, crying)

103
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,215
Cool!

104
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,466
-(tires screeching)
-(horn honking)

105
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,814
-Step lively, Smithers.
-(horn honking)

106
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,889
That orphanage won't demolish itself.

107
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,854
-(horn honking)
-Sir, although...

108
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,944
I do enjoy your loud, excessive honking,

109
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,310
it doesn't seem to be moving the crowd.

110
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,437
Deploy the cow-catcher.

111
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,317
-(grunting, moaning)
-(thud)

112
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,485
(tires screeching)

113
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,333
Whoosh! Once again, my underwear

114
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,198
has become tangled in a cow-catcher.

115
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,035
Ooh, d'oh, tarnation!

116
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,160
I've got to see
what the excitement's about.

117
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,287
Make way!

118
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,424
Doctor coming through.

119
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
(groaning)

120
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,094
-Excuse me.
-(shrieks)

121
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,249
-I'm sorry.
-(shrieks)

122
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,337
Pardon me, good sir.

123
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,221
Well, hi-diddly-- (screams)

124
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,418
That's a good lad.

125
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,800
(groaning)

126
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,345
Books and cocoa in the same store?

127
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,259
What's next, a talking banana?

128
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,597
-Huh?
-Uh, I don't see one, sir.

129
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,144
No, of course not.

130
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,898
The very notion
of a talking banana is absurd.

131
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,105
Still...

132
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,402
(fanfare playing)

133
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,815
(crowd exclaiming)

134
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,994
Attention, good shoppers of Springfield.

135
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,745
Someone very special
has just entered the store.

136
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,789
The world's most popular billionaire--

137
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:58,922
Oh, please. All this fuss
for little old me.

138
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,511
Please welcome the owner
of Fortune Megastores,

139
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,878
Arthur Fortune.

140
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,005
What?

141
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,465
Hello, Springfield!

142
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,806
Hello, Arthur!

143
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,641
You know, I've done a lot
of exciting things in my life.

144
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,227
I went down Mount Everest
on a boogie board...

145
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,573
Oh! Ooh!

146
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,938
Climbed Niagara Falls...

147
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,534
Oh! Wow!

148
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,239
And just last month,
I knocked out Muhammad Ali.

149
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,361
(doorbell ringing)

150
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,372
(blow landing)

151
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,700
How awful.

152
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,454
But this is the biggest thrill ever,

153
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,706
the opening of my 112th store.

154
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,709
(cheering)

155
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,750
Now, I'm afraid, I've got some bad news

156
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,085
from my accountant today.

157
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,300
It seems I have too much money.

158
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,473
Who wants a dollar?

159
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,010
I do! I do!

160
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,433
I do!

161
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,721
Hah, right! What's your name, young man?

162
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,555
I don't know. Just give me the dollar.

163
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,100
Well, I hope this starts you
on your way to a great fortune.

164
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,896
Now, who wants the second dollar?

165
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,359
-I do.
-Uh, well, all right. Here.

166
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,480
-Now.
-I do.

167
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,776
Oh, the heck with it.

168
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,780
Dollars for everyone.

169
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:11,412
(cheering, clamoring)

170
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,701
Fortune! Fortune! Fortune...

171
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,535
That man's totally insane.

172
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,961
Uh, well, this goes
right into the old poor box.

173
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,581
Not so fast, old chum.

174
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,707
(screaming)

175
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,671

Uh, the man has no idea

191
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,655
how to behave like a billionaire.

192
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:58,865
Where's the dignity?

193
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,205
Where's the contempt for the common man?

206
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,405

HOMER: Easy.

210
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,622
Easy.

211
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,170
(exclaims excitedly)

212
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,502
Whoo-hoo! Look at me, I can juggle.

213
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,168
-Mmm, Simpson!
-(grunts)

214
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,296
(explosion)

215
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,552
I need your help.

216
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,717
I want to be loved.

217
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,224
I see.

218
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,932
Well, I'll need some beer.

219
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,675
I want you to look at me

220
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,436
the way I saw you look at Arthur Fortune.

221
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:07,646
Oh, Arthur Fortune. (wistful sigh)

222
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,032
Yes. That's the look I'm looking for.

223
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,819
What would make you and your slovenly kind
look at me that way?

224
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,664
Well, you don't have to
call me "slovenly."

225
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,700
Yes, exactly.

226
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,742
That's the kind of pointer I need.

227
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,156
Tell me more, fatty.

228
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,658
-Hmm.
-Though, this is a great idea, Simpson.

229
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,078
Free silver dollars!

230
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,996
Compliments of C. Montgomery Burns!

231
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:33,384
-(coins clinking)
-(screaming)

232
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,136
(yells) Take it out! Take it out!

233
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,217
No! Ooh! Put it back! Put it back!

234
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,481
That was a close one.

235
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,192
Want to go bowling?

236
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,898
Maybe you should see a doctor
about that coin in your brain.

237
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,809
Maybe you should mind your own business.

238
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,938
Afternoon, miss.

239
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,074
(horrified gasp)

240
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,742
I can't believe it.

241
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,282
{\an8}I'm still not among the hundred
most popular billionaires.

242
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,156
{\an8}I'm behind Adam Sandler, for God's sake.

243
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,503
Well, how about donating money to charity?

244
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,619
Lots of crazy old coots do that.

245
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,286
A charitable donation, eh?

246
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,629
Well, there's a first time for everything.

247
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,257
Um, there.

248
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,419
Take this check for $200,000

249
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,718
to the Springfield Hospital.

250
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,842
Can do.

251
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,515
(grunts)

252
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,694
Now there's nothing to do

253
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,729
but sit back and wait

254
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,613
for the kudos to roll in.

255
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:37,783
(crickets chirping)

256
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,699
(coughing, gagging)

257
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,871
Where are my kudos?

258
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,285
Mm, no.

259
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,333
We don't have any record

260
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,536
of you giving the hospital
any money, Mr. Burns.

261
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,746
(gasps) Oh, but we did get

262
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,046
a very generous donation

263
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,169
from a Mr. Homer Simpson.

264
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,296
What?

265
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,474
{\an8}(grunting)

266
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,764
{\an8}It's not fair. It's not fair.

267
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,428
{\an8}(muttering)

268
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,558
(groaning) Morphine, please.

269
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:08,975
HOMER: Wait a minute.

270
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,601
Because I brought the check,

271
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,818
they named a wing after <i>me</i>?

272
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:16,738
(laughing)

273
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,649
Oh, you must be mad.

274
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,118
Well, I will be
when the morphine wears off.

275
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,318
But until then...

276
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,698
<i>♪ Teedily, deedily, dee-dee ♪</i>

277
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,294
<i>♪ Teedily, dee-dee-dee ooh... ♪</i>

278
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,659
Gee, I feel bad.

279
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,874
If people knew the real Monty Burns,

280
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,536
and not the silver-dollar-throwing

281
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,464
morphine addict you've become,
they might like you.

282
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,094
{\an8}Yeah, if you want to change your image,

283
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,921
{\an8}you've got to get your face out there.

284
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,006
Go on the radio.

285
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,802
That's it. The radio.

286
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,506
I'll go on the most
popular program of the day.

287
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,932
I assume that's still <i>Don McNeill</i>
<i>and his Breakfast Club</i>.

288
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,727
Oh, get with the times, man.

289
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,190
It's <i>Jerry Rude and the Bathroom Bunch </i>.

290
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,441
Oh, I don't think Mr. Burns
would like that show.

291
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,744
What's the matter? Think I'm not hip?

292
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,698
I don't have enough vo-dee-oh-doh?

293
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,083
Thank you, knick-knack and paddy-whack,
the Siamese midgets.

294
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,291
We'll be sure to catch
your new series on FOX.

295
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:10,655
Good luck, Mr. Burns.

296
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,578
And if you get in trouble,
I wrote some jokes

297
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,166
about how white people are different
from black people.

298
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,382
Hmm.

299
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,552
How're you doing, Mr. Burns?

300
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,380
Jerry Rude, welcome to the show.

301
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,005
(titters) I am pleased to--

302
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,511
All right. Let's get this geezer out quick

303
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,393
so we can bring in the lesbian gladiators.

304
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,060
You see, white people
have names like "Lenny,"

305
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,229
whereas black people
have names like "Carl."

306
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,019
(laughing)

307
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,524
Zoom.

308
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,984
Now, Mr. Rude,

309
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,484
I just want you to know I'm a good sport.

310
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,146
If you want to make fun
of my legendary love of cashews,

311
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,816
(chuckles) you have at it.

312
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,074
Uh-huh. All right.

313
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,277
Uh, how many times a day
do you go to the can?

314
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,116
Oh, about 40, I suppose.

315
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,241
When are we going on the air?

316
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,787
We're on the air now, skeletor.

317
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,410
-What?
-Question two.

318
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,037
how long is your wiener, seriously?

319
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,463
Great heavens!

320
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,502
What kind of Radiola show is this?

321
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,415
All right. How about this?
When was your first gay experience?

322
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,875
Oh, well, when I was six,
my father took me on a picnic.

323
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,007
That was a gay old time.

324
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,764
Ho-ho, I ate my share of wieners that day.

325
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,097
Oh, that sounds lovely.

326
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,931
(coughing) Queer. Queer.

327
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,096
Um, ever murder anybody?

328
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,225
Murder?

329
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,651
Well, mistakes have been made.

330
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,730
Monty, I've heard
you're a pretty flatulent guy.

331
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:19,936
Any comment on that?

332
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,435
-No, no. See here.
-(farting)

333
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,777
Stop that. Attention wireless listeners.

334
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,203
Most of the sounds you are now hearing

335
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,371
are not being made by me.

336
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,829
-Do stop. Stop it.
-(farting sounds)

337
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,499
Will someone please stop the farting!

338
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,209
D'oh! Oh! Oh!

339
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,669
Don't worry, folks. He's not dead.

340
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,668
I still hear some faint sounds of life.

341
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,960
(farting sounds)

342
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,634
{\an8}That didn't go well, did it?

343
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,134
Good thing those lesbians knew CPR.

344
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,676
Oh, what's the use?

345
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,179
I'll never be a popular,
beloved billionaire

346
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,602
like Arthur Fortune.

347
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,430
Oh, Arthur Fortune.

348
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,144
(sighs)

349
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,524
You know what that fabulous man just did?

350
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,864
He gave the Springfield Zoo
two male pandas,

351
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,940
and got them to mate successfully.

352
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,237
{\an8}And a stunt like that impresses people?

353
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,991
Oh, yeah, and I'm not easily impressed.

354
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,084
Wow! A blue car!

355
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,080
If a couple of Chinese bamboo gobblers

356
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,542
can win people's hearts,

357
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,752
I'm going to bring them something

358
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,291
that man has searched for

359
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,464
since the dawn of time.

360
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,713
{\an8}-A sober Irishman?
-Even rarer.

361
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,020
HOMER: Whoo! That was
one long helicopter ride.

362
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,654
Do you really think you can capture
the Loch Ness monster?

363
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,733
I mean, he's eluded

364
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,607
Leonard Nimoy and Peter Graves.

365
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,744
(scoffs)

366
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,610
Peter Graves couldn't find ugly

367
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,197
at a Radcliffe mixer.

368
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,742
(clears throat) Let's see now,

369
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,785
we have the monsterometer,

370
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,499
flipper-finder,

371
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,079
hoaxiscope, which is important

372
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,874
for the looking and finding.

373
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,208
Ach, the whole town's turned out.

374
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,053
I've never seen them so excited.

375
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:08,005
Hey, Willie. That old couple
looks just like you.

376
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,092
Aye, 'tis my Ma and Pa.

377
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,927
They own a tavern hereabouts.

378
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,602
They still have the same pool table

379
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,771
on which I was conceived,
born and educated.

380
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,654
{\an8}-So you're back, son?
-Aye.

381
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,820
I suppose you'll be leaving soon.

382
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:24,939
Aye.

383
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,454
(grunting) Good. Good. One more.

384
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,735
-(grunts)
-Where's my monster, tubby?

385
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,787
{\an8}What do you people think
I'm paying you for?

386
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,870
{\an8}Uh, to work in your power plant?

387
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,706
You're not paying me anything.

388
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,881
You kidnapped me. I remember it distinctly

389
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,250
with the grabbing and the duct taping

390
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,546
and the tennis ball in the mouth.

391
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,669
It hurt me.

392
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,756
The beast looks something like this,

393
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,388
{\an8}only without the saucy T-shirt.

394
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,224
-Check.
-OK.

395
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:58,266
(whistling)

396
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,100
(water bubbling)

397
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,690
He's been down
in that icy water for hours.

398
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,446
How can the lad survive
such brutal punishment?

399
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,412
-(dog barks)
-(call bell rings)

400
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,745
(grunts) Tilt, you monster!

401
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,919
(beeping)

402
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,342
Oh, my great, good God.

403
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,920
Gentlemen, your attention, please.

404
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,125
I am detecting a gigantic amphibious
life-form.

405
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,966
It's 80 meters long
and it's heading this way.

406
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,433
Oh, good glayvin! It's on my shoe!

407
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,513
(beeping continues)

408
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,268
It's a... a small frog.

409
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,559
Just get off. Just get off there.

410
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,732
Get out. Get out!

411
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,557
Stupid machine. Oh, wait a minute.

412
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,186
This isn't the monsterometer.
It's the frog-exaggerator.

413
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,534
Oh, my!

414
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,439
We're the laughingstock of the town.

415
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,244
Don't worry, Mr. Burns.

416
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,322
We're going to find that monster

417
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,816
no matter how long it takes.

418
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,485
Besides, I'm getting
kind of used to wearing a kilt.

419
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,957
(chuckles) Can you believe,
I'm a size four? Whoo!

420
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,124
-Ach!
-Aye.

421
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,828
D'oh, it's pointless hunting for an animal

422
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,458
that has 24 miles of water to hide in.

423
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,051
Drain the lake.

424
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,421
-What?
-You heard me.

425
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,548
{\an8}Deploy the delochinator.

426
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,812
(grunting, groaning)

427
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,520
(muttering)

428
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,284
(church bell rings)

429
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,366
We've lost our homes
and everything we hold dear.

430
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,488
Aye.

431
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,699
I see it! I see the monster!

432
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,708
(snorting)

433
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,710
Nay, 'tis merely

434
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,132
a Loch Ness High School's
discarded homecoming float.

435
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,050
{\an8}-No way! Aberdeen rules!
-(explosion, crashing)

436
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,344
(all screaming)

437
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,348
-(roaring)
-(all screaming)

438
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,144
My God, it's him!

439
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,899
Come on, boys. Overpower it.

440
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,309
(whistling)

441
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,727
Fine. I'll do it myself.

442
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,534
(snorting)

443
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,662
That was amazing, Mr. Burns.

444
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,699
I was a little worried
when he swallowed me,

445
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,043
but, well, you know the rest.

446
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,502
(sighs)

447
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,749
And now for my triumphant return

448
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,871
to Springfield.

449
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,008
Monster fever has gripped
Springfield by the throat,

450
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,841
and it's all thanks to one man.

451
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,846
Montgomery Burns has captured
not only a legendary monster,

452
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,559
but also our hearts.

453
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,229
And by the way, girls, he's single.

454
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,479
Single?

455
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,440
Well, he passes the Selma test.

456
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,271
(crowd cheering)

457
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,860
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

458
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:57,742
And now, presenting
the ninth wonder of the world,

459
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,871
the eighth being Gomer Pyle's
heavenly singing voice,

460
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:04,539
I give you the Loch Ness monster!

461
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,500
(cheering)

462
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,421
-Thank you. You're too kind.
-Monty! Monty!

463
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,959
-Yes, that's it. Let it all out.
-Monty! Monty!

464
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,884
Clutch me to your common bosom.

465
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,302
Hey, look. He's getting up!

466
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,433
No, no. Stop it. Stop it.
You'll enrage the beast!

467
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,564
(cooing)

468
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,601
No more pictures.

469
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,853
You're driving him mad.

470
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,935
(groaning)

471
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,114
Stop it. You're blinding me!

472
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,146
(groaning) Oh! I can't see.

473
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,488
(grunting) Run!

474
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,372
Run!

475
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,946
Mr. Burns will kill us all!

476
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,618
-Wait. Don't go.
-(thud)

477
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,037
Love me!

478
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,797
Well, if you wanted people to love you,

479
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,261
you sure blew it with that insane rampage.

480
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,842
-(sighs)
-But you know what?

481
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,894
To be loved, you have to be
nice to people,

482
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,392
every day!

483
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,693
But to be hated,
you don't have to do squat.

484
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,308
You know, perhaps, you're right.

485
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,765
I got so swept up
with the notion of being liked,

486
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,855
I completely forgot who I am.

487
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,901
I am a selfish old crank,

488
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,895
and that fits me like a Speedo.

489
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,949
(cooing)

490
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,371
So what do we do with our friend here?

491
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,831
Throw him in the dumpster?

492
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,161
No, no, no.

493
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,289
I really want to give
the lovable scamp a good home.

494
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,633
-D'oh!
-Tough luck, Simpson.

495
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,297
Come on, Nessie, one more pull.

496
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,965
(shrieking)

497
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,313
OK. OK.

498
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,138
You want a shrimp cocktail?

499
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,273
-(grunts)
-Yeah, they're not great.

500
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,190
(theme music played on bagpipes)

501
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,530
(theme music playing)

502
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,267
Shh!

503
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,227
LISA: <i>Ooh, I hear this really sucks.</i>
