{\an8}We're sure to be

20
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,280
{\an8}You set off the smoke alarm
to rush us to a beer festival?

{\an8}(laughing) I know, I'm a character.

-Twist off, damn it.

00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,148
{\an8}I guess I'll be driving.

34
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,947
{\an8}Right this way to the Duff
designated drivers' rockin' fun zone.

{\an8}Rockin' fun zone?

36
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,199
{\an8}That sounds fun...

37
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,543
{\an8}I don't see the need for razor wire.

38
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,257

89
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,151

See what happens when you skip rehearsal?

97
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:43,677

101
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,352
I wouldn't have to touch the drunk.

00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,301
Uh, I just want to say that

109
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,092
it was an honor for me to compete

110
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,715
with the Mick and the chick
with the rack there.

111
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,263
-Yeah, all right, Moe!
-That's my Moo!

112
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,307
And now, to take

119
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,375
When I get home, there are going to be
a lot of open pickle jars.

120
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,965
That one.

121
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,013
Kids, would you like a balloon?

122
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,675
Yeah, right, Mom. Then I'd like
a rattle and a wowwipop.

123
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,225
Actually, I would like a wowwipop.

124
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,348
Those balloons won't biodegrade
for 10,000 years.

125
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,767
And if Bart gets a wowwipop,
I want a wowwipop.

126
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,232
Ah, Maggie wants a balloon

127
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:26,197
and daddy will take a hand
stamp so he can get back in.

128
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,609
-(groaning)
-Just kidding.

129
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,329
Remember my face.

130
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,372
Oh, boy! Uh... (groans)

131
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,376

-Moe, the new Duff calendars are out,

132
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,462
the ones with your picture!

133
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,297
Oh, boy! Move over, liquor license.

134
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,343
Hey, Moe, this license expired in 1973,

135
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,928
uh, and it's only good in Rhode Island,
and it's signed by you.

136
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:58,385
Yeah, yeah, I've been meaning to get
that updated, uh, for this state and real.

137
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,648
Now, let's see the poster boy
for the new Moe-lennium.

138
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,614
(stammering)

139
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,822
They put a sticker over my face.

140
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:11,865
Hey! "Viva La... Kiss..." What?

141
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,369
Aw, for the love of Jeff!

142
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:20,331
-Ugh... Oh! Am I really that ugly?
-Moe, it's all relative.

143
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,206
-Is Lenny really that dumb?
-(gasps)

144
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,633
Is Barney that drunk?

145
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,011
Is Homer that lazy, bald and fat?

146
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,127
Oh, my God, it's worse than I thought.

147
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,047
(crying)

148
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,306
See, this is why I don't talk much.

149
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,059
I can't believe they put
those stickers over my face.

150
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,022
(sighs) I must be the ugliest man alive.

151
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,816
Oh, Moe, there's lots of people
uglier than you.

152
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,531
Like, you ever been to White Castle?

153
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,031
Oh, boy, Pigtown, U.S.A.

154
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,743
Aw, come on, look at me, I'm a gargoyle.
What with the cauliflower ear

155
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,285
-there and the lizard lips...
-Little rat eyes.

156
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,620
-Caveman brow.
-Don't forget that fish mouth.

157
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,455
OK! I get it. I ain't pleasant to look at.

158
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,962
-Or listen to.
-Or be with.

159
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,053
Come on, Moe, don't feel bad.

160
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,588
There's too much emphasis
on looks these days.

161
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,683
That's why they won't let Bill Maher on TV
before midnight.

162
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,219
Hey, Moe, if you're
tired of being an eyesore

163
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,813
Why not get some plastic surgery?

164
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,968
Plastic surgery, huh?

165
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:22,057
Yeah, maybe they can dynamite Mount
Crapmore here and carve me a new kisser.

166
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:25,524
Oh, I don't know. Plastic surgery might
make you look good on the outside,

167
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,226
but you still might
feel bad on the inside.

168
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,277
But I'd look good on the outside, right?

169
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,901
Yeah, but you'd feel bad inside.

170
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,658
Plastic surgery it is!

171
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,909
Carl Carlson, you just saved my life.

172
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,082

-Hey! Get out of there.

173
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,956
-(gurgling happily)
-Look at her.

174
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,841
It must be great to be a baby
and be so easily amused.

175
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,169
Yeah, I wish I could be entertained

176
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,554
by two cents' worth of rubber

177
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,300
shaped like some colorful animal

178
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:55,092
dancing and twirling...
Dancing and twirling...

179
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,637
-Hey! Give me that!
-(grunting) That's mine!

180
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,771
(squealing unhappily)

181
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,364
The door!

182
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,025
Oh, no!

183
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,199
(gurgling unhappily)

184
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,411
OK, don't panic, I'll get the bikes.

185
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,491
I hope they're hover bikes.

186
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,407
Oh, man, that would be so awesome.

187
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,655
(groaning)

188
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,002
Mm-hmm... Yeah.

189
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,206
Hmm...

190
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,960
Hmm...

191
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,678
(imitates bomb whistling)

192
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,299
(imitates explosion)

193
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,595
It's hopeless, ain't it?

194
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,008
No, no, no, I love a challenge.

195
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,967
First, we must install buttocks.

196
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,808
Nah, nah, nah,
no luxury items, just a face.

197
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,484
OK, I'm going to move this up, this wider.

198
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:49,984
We're going to lose that.

199
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,976
I've never even seen one of these.

200
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,738
Can the medical mumbo jumbo.

201
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,069
-Can you fix me or not?
-Well, we'll see.

202
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,775
You know, most faces
need a little remodeling,

203
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,076
but this is a total tear-down.

204
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,907
Let me clean up this mess I made.

205
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,246
Hey, hey! Hey, that really burns there!

206
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,332
Oh, stop it, you're worse
than Faye Dunaway.

207
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,839
(Bart grunting) We've got to get closer.

208
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,842
Oh, I'm trying!

209
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,974
Can't I get on your shoulders?

210
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,841
I'm not riding a girl's bike.

211
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,848
Hey, it's getting away!
Step on it! Hyah! Hyah!

212
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,971
-Stop kicking me!
-Hyah!

213
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,814
Oh, boy! What a mug!

214
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,935
Yeah. You should see his genitals.

215
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,022
Would you like to see them?

216
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,607
I'm awake here.

217
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,569
{\an8}Uh-oh. This isn't anesthetic.
It's new car smell.

218
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,204
Oh, sorry, Doctor.

219
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:45,371
<i>♪ Oh, silver bells, silver bells... ♪</i>

220
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,625
It's going into that building!

221
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,172
Nice suit, Jeeves.

222
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:59,216
{\an8}Daddy, I'm stealing! I'm stealing!

223
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,599
Oh, that's my little dude.

224
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:07,564
We need a symbol. Something that says
we're gay and Republican.

225
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,107
A little on the nose, don't you think?

226
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,650
(panting) Excuse me.

227
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,494
We just came to get our balloon.

228
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,069
Here you go. And have a bumper sticker.

229
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,235
Thank you.

230
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,992
"A Gay President in 2084"?

231
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,075
We're realistic.

232
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,075
Hurry. Hurry up! I have to pee!

233
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,764
{\an8}-Beautiful.
-OK, now do Moe.

234
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,921
Well, Moe, now we see

235
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,008
if you go on my wall of fame

236
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,603
or my blooper reel.
-Oh...

237
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,062
Oh...

238
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,808
-(both gasping)
-What? I'm a monster, right?

239
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,935
I knew it. I guess I'll just crawl back
to live in the sewer,

240
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,233
periodically emerging to sue you.

241
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,742
{\an8}(gasps) Is that me?

242
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,784
Oopsie! We've got some leakage.

243
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,866
{\an8}Let me just cauterize that for you.

244
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,081
(Moe screaming)

245
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,911
-Bye, Moe.
-Don't be a stranger, handsome.

246
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,167
Bye-bye.

247
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,578
Homer, did you hear that?

248
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,997
She called me handsome. Me!

249
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,006
It's like I've gone to heaven.

250
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,094
Wait a minute. I died on
the operating table, didn't I?

251
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,925
(laughing) Yeah, but just for a minute.

252
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,891
It's a funny story.
I'll tell you sometime.

253
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,431
So this is all real?

254
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,805
Oh, you dear, dear man.

255
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,312
You're one of us beautiful people now.

256
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,814
And your new life begins today.

257
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,067
{\an8}A new life.

258
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,738
{\an8}A second chance... for revenge.

259
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,159
That brown patch needs a little H2O!

260
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,659
Oh, yeah!

261
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,913
Hey, Duffman, let's see
how you like a sticker

262
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,123
on <i>your </i>face! Yeah!

263
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,038
Duffman can't breathe!

264
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,253
Oh, no! Ooh!

265
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,220
-Hello.
-Yeah, hello, yourself.

266
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,928
I'm Moe Syzslak. Back in high school,

267
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,809
I asked you to the Springtime
Pumpkin Dance and you turned me down.

268
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,598
Well, I just wanted to show you the face

269
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,143
-that you could have been kissing.
-HOMER: Yeah!

270
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,397
Oh, I was just a stupid kid back then

271
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,439
and I feel terrible about hurting you.

272
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,153
Will you accept my apology?

273
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,573
Apology?

274
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,737
Uh... Geez, I wasn't expecting that. Uh...

275
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,235
Run!

276
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,203
Man, that felt great!

277
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,205
OK, last stop, Channel Six.

278
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,419
You going to get even with that lottery
guy that never picks our numbers?

279
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,170
Nah, nah, nah. This is personal.

280
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,381
<i>It all goes back to my acting days.</i>

281
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:45,184
<i>I was auditioning for the role</i>
<i>of Dr. Tad Winslow</i>

282
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,639
<i>on the hit soap, </i>It Never Ends.

283
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,760
-Angela, I'm afraid I--
-Woman: Thank you. Next!

284
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,977
-What were you thinking?
-Well, you said you wanted "gritty."

285
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,690
In other words, "ugly."

286
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,770
I wanted "Mary Ann
on <i>Gilligan's Island" </i>ugly

287
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,566
not "Cornelius on
<i>The Planet of the Apes" </i>ugly.

288
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,990
"TV" ugly, not "ugly" ugly.

289
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,746
I've been called ugly,
pug ugly, fugly, pug fugly,

290
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,618
but never ugly ugly.

291
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,825
Well, it's time to get some closure.

292
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,917
Extreme closure.

293
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,973
But I've been Dr. Tad Winslow
for 25 years.

294
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,260
It's time I got a raise.

295
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,104
{\an8}Oh, shut up, you windy, old hack.

296
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,469
And another thing. You have
to stop calling me that.

297
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,976
Remember me? Twenty-five years ago,

298
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,229
you said I was too ugly
to play Dr. Tad Winslow.

299
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,192
{\an8}I did? Well, that's why
pencils have erasers, hon.

300
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,443
You're our new Dr. Tad Winslow.

301
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,895
Really? You mean it?

302
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,605
But there can't be two Dr. Tad Winslows.

303
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,776
That's going to... Oh.

304
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,162
{\an8}I've been waiting
all my life for this moment.

305
00:15:56,246 --> 00:16:00,076
-(laughing)
-Homer, whoa, whoa, Homer.

306
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,627
Change of plans.

307
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,498
Whatever.

308
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,426
MAN (on TV): <i>Like the cleaning of a house,</i>

309
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,930

<i>And as Dr. Tad Winslow,</i>

00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,823
<i>Moe Szyslak.</i>

314
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,610
I don't know if I'll be able to accept Moe

315
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,284
as Dr. Tad Winslow.

316
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,742
Well, I'm going to keep watching

317
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,912
as long as they have shocking story twists

318
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,411
and endless pillow talk.

319
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,374
Cleo, Cleo...

320
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,002
You've brought music to my heart,

321
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,789
but this relationship can never work.

322
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,713
I'm a doctor and you're
a 5,000-year-old mummy

323
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,043
I brought back to life.

324
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,748
But I love you, Tad.

325
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,758
And together, we can burn
all the cities of the Earth.

326
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,141
It's against
hospital regulations, damn it!

327
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:54,468
And Clive Dancer's
just waiting for me to slip up.

328
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,265
So, Lenny, how are things working out

329
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,730
with you and that girl next door?

330
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,020
Ah, it's over. She got a window shade.

331
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,396
{\an8}-ALL: Wha...
-Whoa, whoa,

332
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,941
if you must grope me, ladies.

333
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,685
Please, a little softer.

334
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,026
(chuckles) OK, now, harder.

335
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,994
Hey, there are women in our bar.

336
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,453
Hey, Moe, beer me.

337
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,953
I'm a little busy, Homer.

338
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,325
Uh, you can pour it yourself.

339
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:22,083
Hmm. This isn't nearly as complicated
as Moe made it seem.

340
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,376
(acreaming and sputtering)

341
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:29,551
(gurgling)

342
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,091
I didn't bring you back to life

343
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,335
so you could make
a fool of me at the club!

344
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,677
You don't love me!

345
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,012
The only thing you love is

346
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,056
your ear, nose and throat pavilion.

347
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,480
I've dedicated my life
to diseases of the head hole,

348
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,730
but the one hole
I've never been able to fix

349
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,652
is the one in my soul!

350
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,401
That was amazing, Moe.

351
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,363
I'm actually a little turned on.

352
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,033
Yeah. Hey, I got a gift.

353
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,451
As a child, I was bitten
by the acting bug.

354
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,830
Then it burrowed under my skin
and laid eggs in my heart.

355
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,869
Now those eggs are hatching, and I...

356
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,662
The feeling is indescribable.

357
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,116
I know what you mean. Our dog had that.

358
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,207
-(knocking at door)
-DELIVERY BOY: Excuse me.

359
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,672
I got a delivery here for the producers.

360
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,877
"Top Secret Storylines"?

361
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,723
Uh, I'll sign for it.

362
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,387
Eh, might as well have a little peek...

363
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,720
(chuckles)

364
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,602
Hmm... Hmm! Looks like my character

365
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,805
gets back together
with that evil Contessa.

366
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,726
-The one with the amulet?
-Precisely.

367
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,943
Then I get in a skydiving accident

368
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,815
{\an8}and have to be rushed to the... graveyard?

369
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,073
{\an8}They're killing off Dr. Tad Winslow!

370
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,695
What? Let me see that.

371
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,532
"Interior coroner's office.

372
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,787
Close-up on Dr. Winslow's mangled corpse.

373
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,209
{\an8}"CORONER: Let's get
that brain out and weighed

374
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,708
and call it a day."

375
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,830
Yep. That does sound kind of bad.

376
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,207
Well, if they're going
to stomp on my dreams,

377
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,924
the least I can do is go out
in a blaze of sour grapes.

378
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,971
I never used to trust you, Contessa,

379
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,261
but now you seem so nice.

380
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:01,805
Why don't we celebrate
your newfound trust in me

381
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,104
by taking a skydiving lesson?

382
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,805
Well, how could I say no
to such a captivating--

383
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,566
-HOMER: Ding dong.
-Whoa! It's the door!

384
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,526
(ghostly voice) Dr. Winslow.

385
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,033
Why, who are you?

386
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,945
I am an angel from the future.

387
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,123
-Angel?
-What the fudge?

388
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:25,252
{\an8}-Should I cut him off?
-No. Let's see where this is going.

389
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,630
And what do you have to tell
us, oh, angel of the future?

390
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:32,839
You're going to die
in a skydiving accident.

391
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,131
How tragic! Tell me more.

392
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:38,505
Gabriella's baby shower
will be invaded by terrorists,

393
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,354
with sexy results.

394
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,929
Ooh, that's unexpected. What else?

395
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,555
Well, Sister Bernadette
will leave the convent

396
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,982
and start a softball team,

397
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,850
<i>with sexy results.</i>

398
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,767
What's Dad doing on the show?

399
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,026
Who cares? He's dishing out the dirt.

400
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,858
And only then do we find out
that Professor Gallaway's half-sister

401
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:01,366
<i>is plotting to take over</i>
<i>International Perfume and Wine.</i>

402
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,660
Ah! He just gave away
a year's worth of story lines!

403
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,495
Cut him off... now.

404
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,832
(both laughting)

405
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:10,917
-Yeah.
-Yes!

406
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,631
What the hell are you doing?

407
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,381
Sticking it to you
for killing off my character!

408
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,304
-(laughing) Whoo!
-Yeah!

409
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:21,012
You idiot! Dr. Winslow was
only going to die in a dream.

410
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,974
-What?
-Pink pages always mean a dream.

411
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,056
{\an8}I thought dreams was on goldenrod.

412
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,351
{\an8}No. Goldenrod is for coma fantasies.

413
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,305
{\an8}I see.

414
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:34,315
{\an8}So, uh... what time tomorrow?

415
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,609
(laughing)

416
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,952
Escort these men out... now.

417
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,067
Get your hands off me. Get off!

418
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,237
I don't need your stinking show, anyway.

419
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:48,996
With a mug like this,
I can get on any soap in Springfield.

420
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,751
(grunts and scoffs)

421
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,128
Ahhh...

422
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,263
Oh! Oh, my face!

423
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,931
I'm not supposed to put weight on it!

424
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,310
-(all gasping)
-What? What?

425
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:13,398
-Sorry about your face, Moe.
-Nah, it's just as well.

426
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,610
That handsome face was nice,
but it was too much maintenance.

427
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,282
I had to wash it,
rub it with Neat's foot oil.

428
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,951
You did me a favor, Homer

429
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,489
And to think I was about
to sell the bar to hooters.

430
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,083
Yeah. You were... D'oh!

431
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,658
Well, I guess that wraps it up.

432
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,253
Hey, there's one thing
I don't get, though.

433
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,868
When my face was crushed,

434
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,705
why'd it go back to my old face?

435
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,210
I mean, shouldn't it have turned into some
kind of third face

436
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,343
that was different?

437
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,459
(chuckles) It don't make no...

438
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,850
(theme song playing)

439
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,132
-(murmuring)
-Shh.

440
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,546
Oh, yeah!

441
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,012
