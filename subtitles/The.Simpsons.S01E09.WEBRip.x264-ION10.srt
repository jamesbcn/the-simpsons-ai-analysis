I love birthdays.

No, Homer, it's mine.

26
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,758
You don't even know
your own wife's birthday?

Well, of course I know.
Sure.

I forgot, didn't you?

Right.
What did you get her, Dad?

00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,005
Yeah, what did you get?

00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,892
Well, a very thoughtful gift.

I think I'll take a little stroll
around the block.

35
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,323
I think he forgot, Mom.

36
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,738
No. Come on.
Come on. Open up!

37
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,537
Good morning, consumers.

38
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,700

Um... nah.

43
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,428
Nah, too corny.

44
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,850
Too exciting.

Patty, he's out buying me
something right now.

46
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,596
Marge. He never gets you
anything you want.

47
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,346
He always gets something
for himself.

48
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,607
The tackle box.

49
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,129
Remember when he got you
the tackle box?

50
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,689
And Connie Chung.

51
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:34,025
And when he surprised you
with the Connie Chung calendar?

52
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,572
I'm sure he doesn't
do it deliberately.

53
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,246
Well, Homer and I had
a lovely dining experience

54
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,409
at Chez Pierre.

55
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,417

Marge, please?

I'm gonna stop talking...
now.

111
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,793
You bought that bowling ball
for you, not for me.

112
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,047
What? No.

113
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,128
The holes were drilled
for your fingers.

114
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,093
I wanted to surprise you.

115
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,284
I couldn't very well
chop your hand off

116
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,720
and bring it to the store,
could I?

117
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,931
You never intended for me
to use that ball.

118
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,972
Well, if that's how you feel,
I'll take it back.

119
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,636
You can't take it back.
You had your name engraved on it!

120
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,095
- So you'd know it's from me!
- Homer,

121
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,726
I'm keeping the ball...
for myself!

122
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,943
What? But you don't
know how to bowl. Oops.

123
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,435
I'm keeping it,
and I'm going to use it.

124
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,107
Thank you
for the present, Homer.

125
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,617
Well... you're...
welcome.

126
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,094
Excuse me.
Where do I throw this?

127
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,088
- Over there.
- Thank you.

128
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,630
- Wait a minute. You're gonna need a lane.
- No, thanks.

129
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,094
- I'm here out of spite.
- Can't bowl without a lane.

130
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,005
- Well, all right.
- Okay. Here you go.

131
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,425
You keep score on this.

132
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,563
- What size shoes you wear?
- Never you mind.

133
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,560
You can't wear
street shoes on the lanes.

134
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,792
You gotta wear bowling shoes.

135
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,190
What size, please?

136
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,439
- 13 double "A."
- 13 double "A"?

137
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,782
This is the closest I've got.

138
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,818
A nine and a fifteen.

139
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,702
Thank you.

140
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,118
A little warm and moist.

141
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:10,601
So, 120 pins later,
I am the better man.

142
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,563
I don't see what he's doing

143
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,404
that's so different
from what I'm doing.

144
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,448
I'm... I'm awfully sorry.

145
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,450
Entirely my fault.

146
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,582
It is nice to meet you,

147
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,044
Homer.

148
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,460
No, no.

149
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,918
Homer's my... ball's name.

150
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,169
I'm Marge.

151
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,430
Your fingers are so slender,
so feminine.

152
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,638
They're far too tapered
for the ball you're using.

153
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,059
You need something lighter.
More delicate.

154
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,059
Here.
Use my ball.

155
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,191
No. No, thank you,
Mr., um, Brunswick.

156
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,649
- Call me Jacques.
- Jacques.

157
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,440
- Marge.
- I'll just use my ball.

158
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,105
As you wish.

159
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,824
Many people have
senseless attachments

160
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,614
to heavy, clumsy things,

161
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,617
such as this Homer of yours.

162
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,829
May I ask you a bold question?

163
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,121
- Sure.
- You've never bowled before.

164
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,825
- Never. No.
- No.

165
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,875
Then I will teach you.

166
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,588
I don't wanna trouble you.

167
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,298
Not at all.
I am a professional.

168
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,838
Roll the ball for me, Marge.
Let me see your form.

169
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,383
All right.
But I'm not very good.

170
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,760
I can hit that one pin
all right,

171
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,467
but the rest of them
don't even wobble.

172
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,727
I can help you, Marge.
Pick up the ball.

173
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,099
Pick up Homer.
Pick him up.

174
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,899
- Now throw.
- But...

175
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,072
Throw, damn you.

176
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,076
You're a very good teacher.

177
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,698
Yes, I am a very good teacher,
and I can teach you everything.

178
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,786
I can tell you what the little arrows
on the wood floor mean,

179
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,922
which frame is the beer frame.

180
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,019
I bet you don't know how to make
a five-seven-ten split.

181
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,253
- Do you, Marge?
- No.

182
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,007
But first of all, you yell,
"The eight-pin is a cop."

183
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,680
Let it out, Marge. Laugh loud.

184
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,139
Laugh out loud.
You'll lose weight.

185
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,180
- That's very funny.
- Feels good.

186
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,724
I didn't realize there was
so much to this game.

187
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,728
What do you charge for lessons?

188
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,310
- Twenty-five dollars.
- Twenty-five dollars!

189
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,936
It's a $40 value.

190
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,983
Well, all right.
When do we start?

191
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,147
We have already begun.

192
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,405
Now this is living, kids?

193
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,621
Hot pizza... the food of kings.

194
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,003
Don't be scared, Dad.

195
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,619
It's not so hard
takin' care of us.

196
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,956
Lisa, I'm not scared.

197
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,631
I think it's a great chance
to spend some time with you kids.

198
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,311
Your mother always gets
to be alone with you,

199
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,377
and now it's my turn.

200
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,798
Does the time
always drag like this?

201
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:58,505
First, you must get
to know your lane.

202
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,308
Feel the slickness.
Feel the satiny finish.

203
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,153
Caress it.
Experience it.

204
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,319
- Quite smooth, isn't it, Marge?
- Ooh, very smooth.

205
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,438
- Smooth? Yes?
- Yes, very. Yes.

206
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,145
- Yes. Smooth? Yes.
- Smooth. Yes.

207
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,026
You could eat off of it.
You hungry?

208
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,454
- Yes.
- Four onion rings!

209
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,873
Delicioso!

210
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,582
My compliments
to the delivery boy.

211
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,582
Okay. We've eaten
and eaten well.

212
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,964
What else do we have to do?

213
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,842
Let's check the list
your mom left us.

214
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:31,008
Eat.
Clean up.

215
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,298
Don't worry, everybody.

216
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,591
This will be a breeze
if we all pitch in.

217
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,465
All right!
We're clean!

218
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:46,187
Now we'll...
put Maggie to bed.

219
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,360
♪ Lullaby
and good night ♪

220
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,110
♪ Go to bed
and sleep tight ♪

221
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,573
♪ Close your eyes,
start to yawn ♪

222
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,655
♪ Pleasant dreams
until the dawn ♪♪

223
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,378
Homer. Homer?

224
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,130
How was bowling?

225
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,263
It's a very challenging hobby.

226
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,220
Sport, dear. It's a sport,
you silly thing.

227
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,559
But I think I'll do
much better tomorrow night.

228
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,477
You're going back?

229
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,688
Well, sure.
If you don't mind

230
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,768
taking care of the kids again.

231
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,523
No.
I don't mind.

232
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,526
Good night, Homer.

233
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,528
Good night.

234
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:39,283
- It is for you.
- Jacques, it fits.

235
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,485
You got it in my size,
and it has my name on it.

236
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,496
It's really for me.

237
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:48,168
Seventeen-fifty.
Enjoy it, my darling.

238
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,910
Here we are.

239
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,659
You didn't have to drop me off.

240
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,081
But I wanted to.

241
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,749
Marge, do you know
how beautiful you look

242
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,118
in the moonlight?

243
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,924
Jacques.
I'm a married woman.

244
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,919
I know. I know.

245
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,881
My mind says, "Stop,"
but my heart...

246
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,091
and my hips cry, "Proceed."

247
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,633
Marge, darling,
I want to see you tomorrow.

248
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,257
Not at Barney's Bowlarama.

249
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,723
Away from the thunderous
folly of clattering pins.

250
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,215
- Meet me tomorrow for brunch.
- What's brunch?

251
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,698
You'd love it.
It's not quite breakfast,

252
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,476
it's not quite lunch,

253
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,231
but it comes with a slice
of cantaloupe at the end.

254
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,574
You don't get completely
what you would at breakfast,

255
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,029
but you get a good meal.

256
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,149
- I don't think so.
- Marge, darling...

257
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,987
there are ten pins in my heart.

258
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,993
You've knocked over eight.

259
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,495
Won't you please
pick up that spare?

260
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:11,748
All right!

261
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,625
- Marge?
- What, Homer?

262
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,929
Nothing.

263
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,808
School bus.

264
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,067
Here you go, kids.
Special lunches.

265
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,070
Lots of good things
for growing bodies,

266
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,072
and some treats just for fun.

267
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,744
Ay, caramba!

268
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,533
Are you going bowling
again tonight, Mom?

269
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,736
Well, yes, I am,
as a matter of fact.

270
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,907
Here's more treats.

271
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,885
But don't worry,
your dad will take care of dinner.

272
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,214
Wednesday.
Hoagie night.

273
00:13:56,252 --> 00:14:00,882
Good-bye, Lisa.
My darling little Lisa.

274
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,681
Good-bye, Bart.
My special little guy.

275
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,846
Great lunches, Lis?

276
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,562
Bart, don't you see?

277
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,812
This is what psychologists
call overcompensation.

278
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,515
Mom is wracked with guilt

279
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,015
because her marriage is failing.

280
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,027
Hey, don't rock the boat, man.

281
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,149
Whatever it is,
we're making out like bandits.

282
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,356
Bart, I read about
what happens to kids

283
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,736
whose parents no longer love
and cherish each other.

284
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,334
They go through
eight separate stages.

285
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,370
Right now,
I'm in stage three, fear.

286
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,374
You're in stage two, denial.

287
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,376
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

288
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,378
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

289
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,340
- I'm not. I'm not. Am not!
- I stand corrected.

290
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,639
- Mimosa?
- I'm a married woman.

291
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,429
Please, don't call me that.

292
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,432
No, no, no, no, no.

293
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,434
Mimosa is the name of the drink.

294
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,436
It's orange juice and champagne.

295
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,938
You're so wonderful

296
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,440
that you thought it was
something offensive.

297
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,772
Well, thank you.

298
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,438
Marge?
Marge Simpson.

299
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,067
You remember me, don't you?

300
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,284
I'm Helen Lovejoy,

301
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,703
the gossipy wife
of the minister.

302
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,281
Yes.
Hello, Helen.

303
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,536
I had just finished eating
and was about to leave

304
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,869
when I looked over this way
and said to myself,

305
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,584
"Why, isn't that
Marge Simpson over there

306
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,504
having brunch with a man
who isn't her husband?"

307
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,304
And I just had to come over
and say hello.

308
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,758
- We're, um...
- Don't squirm on my account.

309
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,469
I am giving her a bowling lesson,
thank you.

310
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:31,430
Now, Marge, the pins on
the three-seven-ten split would be here.

311
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,933
We'll make this little piece
of food the ball.

312
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,936
The ball's bigger.
You know that.

313
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,558
But for food,
this is a good ball.

314
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,895
Well, bye-bye.

315
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,860
See you in church
on Sunday, Marge.

316
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,981
Good-bye, Helen.

317
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,107
Good-bye, Helen.

318
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,114
You have a lovely friend there.

319
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,236
Let's hope something runs over her.

320
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,235
Your laughter
is like music to me.

321
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,867
But if you laugh at what I say next,
I will die,

322
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,865
for I am about to say
something very serious,

323
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,877
perhaps shocking.

324
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,999
Marge, my darling,

325
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,545
I want you to meet
with me again.

326
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,549
- That doesn't shock me.
- Away from prying eyes,

327
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,592
away from the Helens
of the world,

328
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,887
at my apartment...
The Fiesta Terrace.

329
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:27,531
I've been waiting for you.
Come in, my captivating one.

330
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,661
May I have this dance?

331
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,659
Sure.

332
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,661
♪♪

333
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,338
Whoa!

334
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:51,393
You certainly have a lot
of bowling trophies.

335
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,848
I like you so much.

336
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,929
They're not for bowling, Marge.

337
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,845
You're so naive.
They are for lovemaking.

338
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,194
- Really?
- Yes.

339
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,744
- Champagne?
- Please.

340
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,740
There, my darling.

341
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,742
Thank you.

342
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,365
What cosmic force
brought us together, Marge?

343
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,834
- Destiny?
- Yes.

344
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,924
Some divine pinspotter...

345
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,380
must have placed us
side by side.

346
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,512
Like two fragile bowling pins...

347
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,430
Standing bravely...

348
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,258
- Until inevitably...
- We must topple.

349
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,437
Marge, speak to me.

350
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:46,108
- Is Thursday okay?
- It's okay, indeed.

351
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,913
"For Marge"?

352
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,625
Hey, Dad.
What do you say we toss

353
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,625
the ol' apple around?
Sound like fun?

354
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,927
Son, I don't know
if I can lift my head,

355
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,261
let alone a ball.

356
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,176
Aw, come on, Dad.
Get the lead out.

357
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,158
Simpson checks the runner on first.
He's cool. He's fine.

358
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,145
Here's the windup,
and here's the pitch.

359
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,071
Dad, you didn't
even say "ouch."

360
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:34,281
Sorry.
Ouch.

361
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,373
Lisa. Lisa, I think
you're right about Dad.

362
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,508
- Something's very, very wrong here.
- Frightened, Bart?

363
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,704
Welcome to stage three: fear.

364
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,616
Well, come on.
We gotta do something, man.

365
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,624
Sorry, Bart.
I'd love to help you,

366
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,746
but I'm mired
in stage five, self-pity.

367
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,705
Look, Dad. I don't know
what's going on,

368
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,715
but once you gave me
some advice that might help.

369
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,667
I gave you advice?
Get out of here.

370
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,047
Yeah, you did.

371
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,224
You told me when
something's bothering you,

372
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,642
and you're too damn stupid
to know what to do,

373
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,891
just keep your fool mouth shut.

374
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,894
At least that way,
you won't make things worse.

375
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,476
Good advice.

376
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,576
Marge, may I speak to you?

377
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,368
- Sure.
- You know, I've been thinking.

378
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,502
Everyone makes peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches,

379
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,750
but usually the jelly
drips out over the side,

380
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,002
and the guy's
hands get all sticky.

381
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,554
But your jelly stays
right in the middle

382
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,048
where it's supposed to.

383
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,720
I don't know how you do it.

384
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,928
You just got a gift, I guess.
I've always thought so.

385
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,680
I just never mentioned it,

386
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,931
but it's time you knew
how I feel.

387
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,774
I don't believe in keeping
feelings bottled up.

388
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,774
Good-bye, my wife.

389
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,685
Good-bye, Homer.

390
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,449
To the most beautiful
moment in life.

391
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,704
Better than the deed,
better than the memory...

392
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,206
The moment of anticipation.

393
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,883
Jacques, you handsome devil.
Look at you.

394
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:17,131
You're really going
to strike out tonight!

395
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,389
- Ain't you hungry, Homer?
- Starving.

396
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,391
Well, then why aren't
you eating your sandwich?

397
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,893
How can I eat it?

398
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,274
She made it.
It's all I have left.

399
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,563
