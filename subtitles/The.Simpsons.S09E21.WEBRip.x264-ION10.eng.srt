an outstanding student

67
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,704
to be anchor-child.

68
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,330

Today's top story,

00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,198
"Little girl on cloud nine
as dream comes true."

70
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,535
Lisa, I've selected you
to be that child anchor.

71
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,622
I know. I already jumped
to that conclusion.

72
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,337
Hmm. All right,
if you're so smart,

73
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,798
tell me who I selected
to be lunchroom monitor.

74
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,959
Me?

75
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,256
{\an8}Take your sash and go.

76
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,141
This isn't right!

77
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,970
This isn't right at all!

78
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,845
(grunting)

79
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,354

83
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,865

My beautiful shack!

85
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,208
Oh, and I just got it
the way I like it.

87
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,883

The man knows quality work.

89
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,171

in for it, Bart!

90
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,588
Hah! What's he going to do?

91
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,046
I'll kill ya!

93
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,139

98
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,895

All your hard work
and grade-grubbing

100
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,067
have finally paid off.

101
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,914
So who's on your news team?

102
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,620
Nerd, nerd...

103
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,740
Nelson?!

104
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,866
Well, we used to date.
Plus, he threatened me.

105
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,003
Well, don't worry about sports.
I got that covered.

106
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,040
Back off, Bart.

107
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,583
This may be the only chance
I get as a second grader

108
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,877
to produce my own TV show,

109
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,550
and I'm not gonna let
you screw it up.

110
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,588
Mom...

111
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,511
Oh, let your brother do sports.

112
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,469
Mom...

113
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,009
That "mom" stuff
doesn't work on me.

114
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:08,179
HOMER: Ooh! "The gum with
the cracker center."

115
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,426
Mmm.

116
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,397
That'll do it, Apu, so just...

117
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,518

APU: Do not be alarmed.

120
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,737
That is just
my helper monkey, sir.

121
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,068
I got him after a robber

122
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,913
shot me six times
and left me for dead.

123
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,865
Helper monkey, eh?

124
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,042
(laughing)

125
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,621
Hey, I'm on TV!

126
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,666
Fart!

127
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,079
Come on! Quit
fooling around, you guys.

128
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,339
(in foreign accent)
So, we meet again, Mr. Bond.

129
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,172
Bart, get out
of my anchor chair.

130
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,967
Silence, Octopussy!

131
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,301
Come on! This isn't a joke.

132
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,676
All over town, kids are just
waking up from their naps,

133
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,474
cranky and hungry for the news.

134
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,188
Wow! Kent Brockman!

135
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,598
Good luck, kids.

136
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,306
Where the hell's
my grilled cheese?

137
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,688
(monkeys hooting)

138
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,066
I'd like a monkey, please.

139
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,492
And maybe one of those dogs.
What do they do?

140
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,371
Um... They serve as seeing eyes
for the blind, sir.

141
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,869
They do any other tricks?

142
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,290
-No.
-Just the monkey then.

143
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,000
Uh... May I inquire as to how
you are differently abled?

144
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,212
(chuckles) I'm not handicapped.

145
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,963
I'm just lazy.

146
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,875
Uh... Sir, helper monkeys
are only for

147
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,343
the physically challenged
or enfeebled.

148
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,474
Enfeebled?

149
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,970
Ooh, I know just the guy.
Be right back.

150
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,926
Oh, son, this monkey's

151
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,937
going to change my life.

152
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,939
Mind if I take him for a ride?

153
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,941
Sure. I'll just stand here.

154
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,073
(tires screech)

155
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,902
{\an8}Mmm! I can't wait
to eat that monkey.

156
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,777
(imitating news theme music)

157
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,525
And now, <i>Kidz Newz!</i>

158
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,077

160
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,116
Thank you.

161
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,746
Our top story today.

162
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,383
In a move that could
affect children town-wide,

163
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,880
the library book
purchase committee

164
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,592
slashed its budget
by three percent.

165
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,433
First on the chopping block,
periodicals.

166
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,139
Boring.

167
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,429
And now, sports.

to lock the doggy in the barn

169
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,596
'cause here comes
dodgeball action!

170
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,444
The shirts continued
their domination over the skins today.

171
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,690
And in schoolyard fights,

172
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,611
the highly anticipated match
between Kearney and Mr. Largo

173
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,861
ended in a disqualification
for use of dog doo on a stick.

174
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,954
Lisa?

175
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,993
DIRECTOR: And we are out.

176
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,914
All right, kids.
We learned a lot today.

177
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,083
Now, this is what
makes my job difficult.

178
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,043
Bart, you're off
the sports beat.

179
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,123
What?

180
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,917
Sorry, Bart. But you've got to
take some things seriously.

181
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,212
From now on,
you're Lisa's co-anchor.

182
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,586
What?!

183
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,342
Ooh, that's gotta hurt.

184
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,470
{\an8}Anchorman, huh?
Well, if I'm going to be an anchorman,

185
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,266
I better go bleach
the crud off my teeth.

186
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,389
I'll be in makeup.

187
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,807
-(door closes)
-I don't need a co-anchor.

188
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,395
I'm a straight "A" student.

189
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,730
Lisa, Bart's got something

190
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,154
you can't learn
in school. Zazz.

191
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,323
What is "Zazz"?

192
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,111
Zing, zork, kapowza.

193
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,235
Call it what you want.

194
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,871
In any language, it spells
mazuma in the bank.

195
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,618
"Zork"? What is "zork"?

196
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,870
I didn't say "Zork."

197
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,621
The point is,
the camera loves him.

198
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,463
{\an8}But that trivializes
the whole idea of <i>Kidz Newz.</i>

199
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,959
{\an8}I mean, let's be honest.

200
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,591
{\an8}Bart's not exactly
the brightest penny in the fountain.

201
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,628
In English, Lisa.

202
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,336
Damn blueberry stains.

203
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,133
<i>Look, I love Bart,</i>

204
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,967
<i>but he's never even</i>
<i>read a newspaper.</i>

205
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,393
<i>Between you and me,</i>
<i>he's, well...</i>

206
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,394
<i>Kind of dumb.</i>

207
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,728
(sighs)

208
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,858
-(monkey chattering)
-(panicked grunting)

209
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,027
There a problem, honey?

210
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,488
Monkey!
There's a monkey in the house!

211
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,859
-Ah!
-Relax. It's only Mojo.

212
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,818
-Mojo, Marge.
-Marge, Mojo.

213
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,868
He can do anything
you show him.

214
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,042
Watch.

215
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,662
Simpson residence.

216
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,752
(chitters)

217
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,463
Oh. Why didn't you tell me

218
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,375
you were bringing home
a filthy monkey?

219
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:11,513
This filthy monkey
made the orange juice you're drinking.

220
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,512
I'll show Lisa who's dumb.

221
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,734
"Supreme court reverses..."

222
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,979
(groans)

223
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,900
I won't turn to the comics,
I won't turn to the comics.

224
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,230
All right.

225
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:28,194
I'll read one comic just
to get me rolling-- "Archie."

226
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,318
"Hey, Jughead, did you hear?

227
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,863
The supreme court reversed..."
(groans)

228
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,867
(Mojo gibbering)

229
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,080
Mom, am I dumb?

230
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,409
Honey,
I'd love to reassure you,

231
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,504
but right now, mommy needs
a tetanus shot.

232
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,535
(doorbell rings)

233
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,553
Mr. Brockman, I need your help.

234
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,798
I've got to become
a great anchor

235
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,169
so I can show up my sister.

236
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,756
Sister, huh?

237
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,091
I've got a sister.

238
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:56,215
Miss Big-Shot-CNN
Washington correspondent.

239
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,604
(blows raspberry)
But she's not the boss of me!

240
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,021
Come in.

241
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,225
Let's take the trophy
route to the den.

242
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,404
Twelve newsies.

243
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,689
Seven iron mikes.

244
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,902
Four golden coifs.

245
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,943
This is the most prestigious
award that Del Monte gives.

246
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,948
Do you want to hear
my award-winning secret?

247
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,700
Human interest stories.

248
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,121
They tug at the heart
and fog the mind.

249
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,293
Observe.

250
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,160
<i>KENT: Hear that?</i>

251
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,746

00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,918

256
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,773

Marge, the kids are on.

270
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,431
The monkey's
on my part of the sofa.

Honey, he's clearly

We'll bring you more
on this chalk shortage as it continues.

And now, Bart's
been looking into

275
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,231
that alleged ham salad from
yesterday's school lunch.

276
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,773
No, I haven't, Lisa,

277
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,476
because I went out
with a camera

278
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,816
and did a different
kind of story.

279
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,612
(nervously) Bart,
I really think we should stick--

280
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,776
It's about a man...

281
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,073
A simple man.

282
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,776
He's one of...

283
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,656
"Bart's People."

284
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,503
Joe Banks, 82 years young,

285
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,500
has come to this pond every day

286
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,842
for the past 17 years
to feed the ducks.

287
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,049
The last month,
Joe made a discovery.

288
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,510
The ducks were gone.

289
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,801
Some say the ducks
went to Canada.

290
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,795
Others say Toronto,

291
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,257
and some people think

292
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,517
that Joe used to sit down
there, near those ducks.

293
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,810
But it could be

294
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,063
that there's just no room
in this modern world

295
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,977
for an old man and his ducks.

00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,373
Do you think maybe
my power plant

300
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,754
killed those ducks?

301
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,000
There's no maybe about it, sir.

302
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,252
(sniffs)
Excellent.

303
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,554
Marge, can I get a duck?

304
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,418
You already have a monkey.

305
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,626
Can he get a duck?

306
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,926
-No!
-(chattering)

307
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,966
One man, no ducks.

308
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,216
Lisa?

309
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,098
That's <i>Kidz Newz. </i>Good night.

Way to go Bart.

312
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,435
That wasn't news.

313
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,605
That was sappy,
manipulative drivel.

314
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,864
Well. I'm sorry you couldn't
feel for Old Joe.

315
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:02,907
You didn't feel
for him, either,

316
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,530
you big, fat phony!

317
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,867
Bart, look up here.

318
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,371
This is where the tears
would be if I could cry.

319
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,544
But I can't. Botched face-lift.

320
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,293
You could learn
from him, Mary Ann.

321
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,424
-It's Lisa.
-Mary Ann's better.

322
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,297
They want cheap sentiment?

323
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,590
I'll pump them so full of sap,
they'll be blowing their nose

324
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:21,684
with a pancake!

325
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,642
They call her "The Cat Lady."

326
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,010
People say she's crazy

327
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,636
just because she has
a few dozen cats.

328
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:32,314
But can anyone who loves animals
that much really be crazy?

329
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,559
(raving incoherently)

330
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,818
(cats screeching)

331
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,573
The old Union Pacific doesn't
come by here much anymore...

332
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,775

335
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,549
Come on. Come to papa.

336
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,385
(Mojo chittering)

337
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,350
Good boy, Mojo.

338
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,469
Now, bring them down
and I'll give you one.

339
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,399
Will you... stop that?

340
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,519
You're a helper monkey!

341
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,935
This isn't helping!

342
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,895
Oh... I don't need your pity.

343
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,914
(whimpering)

344
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,790
BART: Our forgotten veterans.

345
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,292
Their guns are quiet now...

346
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,043
Their helmets lost or pawned,

347
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,835
and yet, here they are,

348
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,628
making flags
out of old clothes.

349
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,553
Sure, they may not have
the right number of stripes

350
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:48,603
and the colors are all wrong,
and some purists will tell you

351
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,639
the American flag doesn't
contain the word "Jordache."

352
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,845
But, you now, if they
run this up the flagpole,

353
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,106
I'll salute.
I'm Bart Simpson.

354
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,898
Hmm. Thank you, Bart,

355
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,152
for yet another
touching "Bart's People."

356
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,324
Now, turning to--

357
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,992
I just think our veterans deserve
a little recognition.

358
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,491
That's what Veterans Day
is for, Bart.

359
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,914
But is that really enough
to honor our brave soldiers?

360
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,915
(chuckles) They also
have Memorial Day.

361
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,458
Oh, Lisa, maybe you're right.
Maybe you're wrong.

362
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:21,462
The important thing is,
veterans deserve a day to honor them.

363
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,005
They have two!

364
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,508
Well, maybe they
should have three.

365
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,590
I'm Bart Simpson.

366
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,970
Oh, my! Look at
all these letters

367
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,095
from people who want
to be "Bart's People," Bart.

368
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,062
I wish they could all
be "Bart's People," Mom.

369
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,813
I truly do.

370
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,685
I'm proud of you, honey.

371
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,072
You're finally giving
something back

372
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:45,148
to the community
after taking so, so much.

373
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,065
Hmm. Really makes you think.

374
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,866
What does that even mean?

375
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,240
Mom might not see
through you, but I do.

376
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,157
You don't care about
any of these people.

377
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,155
Well, if I'm guilty
of anything,

378
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,917
maybe it's caring too much.

379
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,079
I'm Bart Simpson.

380
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,087
Stop talking like that!
Stop it!

381
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,749
Lisa, please!

382
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,297
You have absolutely
no reason to be jealous.

383
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,932
You're still
a very important part

384
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,468
of Bart's show.

385
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,681
(frustrated groan)

386
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,982
"Bart's Show"!

387
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,848
If everybody knew
what a phony Bart was,

388
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,935
he'd be off
that show so fast...

389
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,477
I've got it!

390
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,193
(laughs)

391
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,943

392

-(screeching laugh)
-(scream)

394
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,873
Hey, Lise, be a doll
and hand me that sealant.

395
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,749
Hey, here's another letter
for "Bart's People."

396
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,296
Oh, so many souls,
so little air time.

397
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:49,877
"Dear Bart,

398
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,177
I came to this country

399
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,350
hoping to share
the American dream.

400
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,719
But after many years
of backbreaking labor,

401
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,386
I find myself homeless
and sleeping in a junkyard."

402
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,515
Oh, how terrible. Read on.

403
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:01,902
"Should I abandon hope

404
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,019
or fight on bravely
against impossible odds?"

405
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,146
Oh, this is too perfect.

406
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,863
It <i>is, </i>isn't it?

407
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,323
I'm going to put him
on the air tonight live.

408
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,824
Oh, Bart, you'll have
to ride your bike pretty fast

409
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:13,946
to get out there in time.

410
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,283
Nah, I'll just
take the chopper.

411
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,239
They gave you a chopper?!

412
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,924
(exhausted groan)

413
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,999
Mojo, will you wipe my mouth?

414
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,594
(grunting)

415
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,257
Oh, for Pete's sakes!

416
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,168
Why is that monkey
wearing a diaper?

417
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,587
I thought he was housebroken.

418
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:32,925
(both grunting)

419
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,430
(annoyed groan)

420
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,932
You said this monkey
would be sweeping the floors

421
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,265
and cleaning the gutters.

422
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,939
And now he just lies there,
struggling to breathe.

423
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,770
(gasping)

424
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:48,105
What do you want?
His cholesterol's through the roof.

425
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,362
I want you to take
that monkey back

426
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,744
so he can be rehabilitated
and get a second chance.

427
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,912
No, no. He's fine.

428
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,031
Go on, Mojo.

429
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,737
Show Marge your happy dance.

430
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,327
(chattering slowly)

431
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,083
(heavy breathing)

432
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,343
And so on.

433
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,629
(grumbles)

434
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:11,924
(buzzes)

435
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,344
(tires squealing)

436
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,467
(gasps)

437
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,723
Mojo! What have
they done to you?!

438
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,596
<i>COMPUTER VOICE:</i>
<i>Pray... For... Mojo.</i>

439
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,607
So, by waking up a little early

440
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,480
and having
some extra sheets handy,

441
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,277
no one's the wiser.

442
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,324
Tomorrow,
destroying the evidence.

443
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,695
Eww.

444
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,742
Uh, thank you, Milhouse.

445
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,196
Now it's time for today's
special live edition

446
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,156
of "Bart's People."

447
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:48,167
(clears throat) Lisa, I've just arrived
at the Springfield dump.

448
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,092
A lot of things get
thrown out here--

449
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,420
Sometimes, even a human being.

450
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,387
Somewhere in this pile
of twisted metal

451
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,098
and soiled mattresses...

452
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,138
(nervous chuckle)

453
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,641
...lives a poor immigrant

454
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:04,232
whose home
was cruelly... taken away.

455
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,889
Yeah! By you!

456
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,058
Groundskeeper Willie!

457
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,556
Um... Uh,

458
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,937
so you're the immigrant
I'm here to help.

459
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:14,034
Help?!
You destroyed my house

460
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,611
and reduced me
to living in a dump!

461
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,027
Groundskeeper Willie, furious with
the government that let him down.

462
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,156
-I'm Bart...
-WILLIE: (yelling)

463
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,163
(chuckling)

464
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,704
I'll kill you!

465
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:25,912

466
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,118
(glass breaking)

467
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,287
Oh, no! What have I done?

468
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,706
Nelson, cover for me.

469
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,926
(clears throat)

470
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,850
(arm farts)

471
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,863
(in singsong voice)
Oh, Bart, it's me, a jolly policeman.

472
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,648
Oh, we got Willie.

473
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,822
Come on out
so we can give you a medal.

474
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,489
Way to go, officer.
(screams)

475
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,200
(both grunting)

476
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,736
Willie, stop!

477
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,155
Away with you!
I got to finish him off

478
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,714
while I'm still
temporarily insane.

479
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,539
No, you can't hurt Bart!
He's...

480
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,042
Well, he's your son!

481
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:12,997
What?!

482
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,383
Well, not literally.

483
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,009
But, in a way, isn't
he everyone's son?

484
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,432
For you see, that
little hell-raiser

485
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,181
{\an8}is the spawn of every
shrieking commercial.

486
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,354
Every brain-rotting soda pop.

487
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,193
Every teacher who cares
less about young minds

488
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,269
than about cashing
their big, fat paychecks.

489
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,776
No, Bart's not to blame.

490
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,358
You can't create a monster

491
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,113
and then whine when he stomps
on a few buildings.

492
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,356
I'm Lisa Simpson.

493
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,414

495
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,579
You're right.

496
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,371
It's all Willie's fault.

497
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,674
I've been a terrible father.

498
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,210
Hey, Lise, thanks.

499
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,962
Boy, that phony
schmaltz of yours

500
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,424
sure is powerful stuff.

501
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,924
Uh, yeah, but I have
a certain respect

502
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,676
for that whole "truth" and
"hard work" thing that you do.

503
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,759
You know, Bart, if we combined

504
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,064
your showmanship
with my integrity,

505
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,558
we could make kids
really care about the news.

506
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,891
You're right.

507
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,726

there's no stoppin' us.
