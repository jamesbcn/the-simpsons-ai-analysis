-(scoffs, sighs)
-Mmm. Hmm.

51
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:56,381
Sir, bad news from accounting.
The economy's hit us pretty hard.

52
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,847
(scoffs) Tough times, huh?
I've lived through 12 recessions,

eight panics and five years
of McKinleynomics.

54
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,385
I'll survive this.

55
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:06,194
Even so, sir, we could stand
to lay off a few employees.

56
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,859
Oh! Very well. Lay off...
him, him, him, him-- Hmm.

Useful people are starting

68
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,641
I haven't been able
to find a job in six years.

69
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,484
Huh. And what training
do you have?

70
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,649
Five years of modern dance.
Six years of tap.

00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,769
{\an8}BROCKMAN: The economic slump
began last spring,

72
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,726
{\an8}when the government
closed Fort Springfield,

73
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:57,146
devastating the city's liquor
and prostitution industries.

74
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,107
Now, at the risk
of being unpopular,

75
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,867
this reporter places the blame

76
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,659
for all this squarely on you,
the viewers.

77
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,661
I propose that I use what's left
of the town treasury...

78
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,287
to move to a more prosperous
town and run for mayor.

79
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,455
And once elected,
I will send for the rest of you.

80
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,593
Boo!

81
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,012
-Excuse me, Mr. Mayor?
-The chair recognizes

82
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,142

of hope in her eyes.

83
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:24,889
This piggy bank contains $15
I saved from my allowance.

84
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,523
It isn't much,
but I would like to help.

85
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,651
Aw, just what I need
to tip the skycaps.

86
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,859
I'll tell you what
made this town great!

87
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,480
Good, old-fashioned gumption!

88
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,487
There's nothing here
a little elbow grease won't fix!

89
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,700
So let's roll up our sleeves...

90
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,571
and--
(snoring)

91
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,618
People! People!

92
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,002
Let's be a little
more realistic.

93
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,368
Now, I, uh, hesitate
to bring this up,

94
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,665
but a number of cities
have rejuvenated their economies...

95
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,959
with, uh, legalized gambling.

96
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,883
(crowd murmuring)

97
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,762
There is an added bonus.
Some of the revenue...

98
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,180
can go to help our underfunded
public schools.

99
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,969
(distant cricket sound)

100
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,934
-Well, I like the part about the gambling.
-What do you think, Reverend?

101
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,687
Once something has been approved by
the government, it's no longer immoral.

102
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,650
-(cheering)
-By building a casino,

103
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,731
I could tighten my stranglehold
on this dismal town!

104
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,067

109
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,249
Actually, I think it might
really help our economy.

00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,582
(murmuring excitedly)

111
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,127
Very well then.
Instead of fleeing this town,

112
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:40,381
I'll stay here and grow fat
off kickbacks and slush funds.

113

And you know
what the best part is?

117
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,727

Gambling with all the glitz
and glamour of the British Isles.

140
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,175
Best of all, the waitresses
and showgirls are all real Brits.

141
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,765
Fresh from the streets of Sussex they are!

-Okay. All right. Wait--

- Get out!

145
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,113
{\an8}(chuckles) Wow. Oh, let me
just get my head together.

146
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,114
{\an8}Now!

147
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:29,155
I'll need three ships
and 50 stout men.

148
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,370
We'll sail round the Horn
and return with spices and silk,

ye have never seen.

-Arr.

00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,002
Can you give me five minutes?

152
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:43,504
(scoffs) Idiots. I'll design it myself!
I know what people like.

153
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,968
It's got to have sex appeal
and a catchy name.

154
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,560
Mom, we're having
a geography pageant at school,

155
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,729
and I don't know
which state to go as.

156
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,978
In honor of legalized gambling,
why not go as the state of Nevada?

157
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,111
No. Nevada makes
my butt look big.

158
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,399
Then how 'bout going
as Florida?

159
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,533
You enjoy orange juice.
Old people like you.

161
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:11,025

00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,825
-Why?
-I got a job at Burns' casino.

As you know, it's been my lifelong dream
to become a blackjack dealer.

164
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,417
Your lifelong dream was to be
a contestant on <i>The Gong Show.</i>

165
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,210

00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,223
(gonging continues)

168
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:35,472
We got more gongs than the break-dancing
robot that caught on fire.

169
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,939
Hello. I'm retired
heavyweight boxer Gerry Cooney.

170
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,033
Welcome to Mr. Burns' casino.

171
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,238
If there's anything I can do to
make your visit more enjoyable,

172
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,609
please, just let me know.

173
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,855
Yeah, great. See ya!

174
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,567
Uh, don't forget
to apply for...

175
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,777
our V.I.P. platinum club
for special discounts on--

176
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,367
-Hey! I said bug off!
-(whimpers)

177
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,418
{\an8}Uh, let's see.
Eighteen, 27, 35--

178
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:07,001
{\an8}Dealer bust!
Looks like you all win again.

179
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,048
Yee-Haw! Homer,

180
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,511
I want you to have
my lucky hat.

181
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,512
I wore it the day
Kennedy was shot,

182
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,014
and it always
brings me good luck.

183
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,597
Why, thanks, Senator. Oop!
Looks like my shift is over.

184
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,524
(all)
Uh-Oh!

185
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,982
GRAMPA:
Come on, lucky seven!

186
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,403
Papa needs
a new pair of spats.

187
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,572
I want some of that
sweet, sweet do-re-mi!

188
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,862
Fat City, here I come!

189
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,986
Please throw the dice now.
Please. Now.

190
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,333
Don't rush me!
I have arthritis.

191
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,329
Will the gentleman
please roll the dice?

192
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,331
All right, all right,
smart guy.

193
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,503
(gasps) Oh, for crying out loud,
I dropped one.

194
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,503
Oh! Now it's in my shoe!

195
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,585
Ow! Ow! Ooh!

196
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,630
Ow! Ooh! Ow! Ooh!

197
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,095
A round of applause please
for Anastasia!

198
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,218
She loves show business.

199
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,636
So much nicer than the savagery
of the jungle, ja?

200
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,068
-(honking)
-(low growl)

201
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,649
Hey, tiger! Wake up!

202
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,485
(growling)

203
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,360
(roaring)

204
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,543
-(roaring)
-(screaming)

205
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,000
(shouting in German)

206
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,297
Whoo-hoo! Jackpot.

207
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,508
Wait a minute!
Are you over 21?

208
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,799
-Are you?
-I'm not authorized to answer that.

209
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,431
(grunts)
By the way, your martinis suck!

210
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,142
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?
Start your own casino,

211
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,853
in your tree house and get all
your little friends to come?

212
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,484
I'd like to see that!
(laughing)

213
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:50,112
Hi. Yeah, welcome.
Have a lucky day! Mm-hmm.

214
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,191
Well, he certainly showed me.

215
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,322
MARGE:
Hi, Homie!

216
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,445
Hey, Marge, after your big tantrum
against legalized gambling,

217
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,163
I bet it feels pretty weird
to be in a casino.

218
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:05,584
-I was for the casino!
-Strike three, Marge!

219
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,955
I remember that meeting,
and I have a photographic memory.

220
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,590
Legalized gambling
is a bad idea.

221
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,052
You can build a casino
over my dead body.

222
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:18,342
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

223
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,807
-For you. It's the president.
-Y'ello?

224
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,428
And then I said to the president--
get this--

225
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,636
Marge? Marge?

226
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,099
Hmm.

227
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,230
Hmm, I wonder if they have
a lost and found.

228
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,151
Oh, what the hey!

229
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,275
-(coins clanking)
-♪♪ (fanfare)

230
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,786
Mmm!

231
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,829
Hmm.

232
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,835
-(lights buzzing)
-(distant chatter)

233
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,049
(chattering continues)

234
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,591
Hey, how's it goin'? Hey!
Good to see you. Tell your friends.

235
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,215
Lookin' lucky! Hey, what's happenin'?
Love the jacket.

236
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,892
-(meows)
-Behold the box of mystery!

237
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,603
The cat goes in-- (straining)
Right here--

238
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:11,395
(screeching)

239
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,570
(screeching continues)

240
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,859
Twenty-one?

241
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,403
Do that card-counting thing again.
Come on. Do it again.

242
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,107
Definitely have
to leave the table.

243
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,157
No! Please, please,
please, please, please.

244
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,121
Gotta watch Wapner. Leave the table.
Yeah, leave the table.

245
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,622
-No!
-(screaming)

246
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,205
(screaming)

247
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,720
Sir, you haven't slept since
the casino opened five days ago.

248
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,933
I've discovered
the perfect business.

249
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,934
People swarm in,
empty their pockets and scuttle off!

250
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,017
Nothing can stop me now!

251
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,522
Except microscopic germs.

252
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,055
But we won't let that happen,
will we, Smithers?

253
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,858
Uh-- No, sir.

254
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,910
-(jingling)
-(whimpering)

255
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,827
(whimpering)

256
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,382
{\an8}Whoa! A baby on the table!
That's good luck!

257
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,880
{\an8}ALL: Yay!

258
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,841
-Snake eyes. Sorry.
-ALL: Boo!

259
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:24,143
Garsh, it must be excitin'
to live in the casino.

260
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,680
<i>-Ja.</i>
-You know, we are having a party tonight.

261
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,984
-(roaring)
-(grunts)

262
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,112
Whoa, Marge!
You gotta watch out.

263
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,030
Your little boy Bart could have been
eaten by that pony!

264
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,529
(gasps) Oh, my God!
Barney, thank you.

265
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,612
I would never have
forgiven myself.

266
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,907
Now, you stay put,
young lady.

267
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,041
-(grunting)
-Oh!

268
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,368
Man, that's classic
compulsive behavior.

269
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,294
Wow! Free beer!

270
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,214
Buddy, those are
my quarters!

271
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,592
-(belches)
-Hey, this guy's paying off!

272
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,920
-(belching)
-(chattering)

273
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:09,769
I don't wanna hit a sore spot,
but can we talk about herpes?

274
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,849
<i>♪ Herpes, herpes bo-berpes ♪</i>

275
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,444
<i>♪ Banana-fana, fo-ferpes</i>
<i>herpes, oh ♪</i>

276
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,771
Hey, that spot
on Gorbachev's head--

277
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,227
Herpes! Trust me.

278
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:24,027
-Anybody here have herpes? Huh? Huh?
-(person coughing)

279
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,953
You people are the worst
audience I've ever seen.

280
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,032
Well, you're the worst
comedian we've ever seen!

281
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,658
Oh, great! Well, we'll just sit here
silently for the next 90 minutes.

282
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,916
-Fine with us.
-(groans)

283
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,968
They're all covered with filthy germs!
Aren't they, Smithers?

284
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,168
Why, what do you mean, sir?

285
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:49,223
-GERMS: Freemasons run the country!
-Ew!

286
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,595
(Marge grunting)

287
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,023
Marge, you waited for me!

288
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,153
(grunts)

289
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,230
-Okay, Marge. Let's go.
-I'll catch up to you.

290
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,776
-Marge, I'm taking the car.
-I'll walk.

291
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,780
-This late? Through the bad neighborhood?
-Yeah.

292
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,323
-Marge--
-Go home! You're bad luck!

293
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,447
Wait! I see
what's happening here.

294
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:17,496
You're just mad because everyone in
this town loves gambling except for you!

295
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,343
-Well, that's just sad.
-(grunting continues)

296
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,925
(grunting)

297
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,221
-Um--
-What?

298
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,765
Excuse me, ma'am. Don't you
think you've gambled enough?

299
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,310
No!

300
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:38,851
Okay. We're required by law to ask every
75 hours. Get her another free drink.

301
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,688
(meows)

302
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,073
Do you get the feeling
this family is disintegrating?

303
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,529
I mean, we haven't had
a meal with Mom all week.

304
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,900
And she hasn't even started my costume
for the geography pageant.

305
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,697
Pipe down, sister! I gotta book
a new act for tonight.

306
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,832
Turns out that Liza Minnelli impersonator
was really Liza Minnelli.

307
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,200
(shivers, grunts)

308
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,327
-There's nothing to eat for breakfast!
-You gotta improvise, Lisa.

309
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:02,795
Cloves, Tom Collins mix,
frozen pie crust-- Mmm!

310
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,168
Maybe Mom just doesn't realize
we miss her.

311
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,375
We could go down to
the casino and let her know.

312
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,636
Aw, come on, Lisa.
There's no reason to--

313
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,929
Let's go see Mom.

314
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,104
(grunting)

315
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,773
Marge, we need to talk.

316
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,062
You're spending
too much time at the casino,

317
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,555
and I think you may
have a problem.

318
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,567
I won $60 last night.

319
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,029
Whoo-hoo!
Problem solved!

320
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,950
Smithers,
I've designed a new plane.

321
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,159
I call it the Spruce Moose,
and it will carry 200 passengers...

322
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:37,121
from New York's Idlewild Airport
to the Belgian Congo in 17 minutes!

323
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,964
-That's quite a nice model, sir.
-Model?

324
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,630
-Mom!
-Huh? What? Lisa, what's up?

325
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,511
-I just had a bad dream.
-Oh, sure.

326
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,968
You just lie down
and tell me all about it.

327
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,929
Well, I know it's absurd,

328
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,970
but I dreamed the bogeyman
was after me, and he's hiding--

329
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,973
(screams)
Bogeyman!

330
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,175
You nail the windows shut.
I'll get the gun.

331
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,976
(grunts) Bart, I don't want
to alarm you,

332
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,860
but there may be a bogeyman
or bogeymen in the house.

333
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,018
(screams)

334
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,566
(tires screeching)

335
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,199
(trembling audibly)

336
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,411
-(Bart and Lisa sighing)
-Hmm.

337
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,621
-What happened here?
-Nothing, Marge. Just a little incident

338
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,753
-involving the bogeyman!
-(gunshot)

339
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,960
None of this would have happened

340
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,790
if you had been here to keep me
from acting stupid!

341
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,546
Oh, I'm sorry. I have been spending
too much time at the casino.

342
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,549
I'll be around more
from now on.

343
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,011
Does this mean you'll help me
with my costume?

344
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,102
Oh, sure, honey.
I promise.

345
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,599
-Thanks, Mom.
-Mmm.

346
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,231
Aw, just like on TV.

347
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:44,059
-(grunts)
-(canned laughter, applause)

348
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,145
Hi. You from the casino?

349
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,283
-I'm from a casino.
-Good enough. Let's go.

350
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,400
{\an8}(lights buzzing)

351
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,160
I'm afraid Robert Goulet
hasn't arrived yet, sir.

352
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,372
Hmm. Very well.
Begin the thawing of Jim Nabors.

353
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:04,044
(panting)

354
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,924
Are you sure this is the casino?

355
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,052
I think I should
call my manager.

356
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,589
Your manager says
for you to shut up!

357
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,593
Vera said that?
Huh.

358
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,345
(grunting)

359
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,678
Dad! Mom said she'd be home
to help me with my costume.

360
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,515
And she's not!
And the geography pageant is tonight!

361
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,061
Lisa, your mom
still loves you.

362
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:28,895
It's just that she has a career now.
She's a slot jockey.

363
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:32,402
But, Dad, if I don't show up in a rubber
suit shaped like the state of Florida,

364
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,236
I'll be the laughingstock
of the whole school.

365
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,322
Oh, it's always something,
isn't it?

366
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,287
First I have to drive your
pregnant mother to the hospital...

367
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,539
so she can give birth to you,
and now this!

368
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,711
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

369
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,921
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow!

370
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,634
-Dad!
-(chuckling) Oh, yeah. The costume.

371
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,505
Hello, "Floreda"!

372
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,223
{\an8}(gasps)
I'm not a state!

373
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,974
I'm a monster!
(sobbing)

374
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,774
No, Lisa. The only monster here
is the gambling monster...

375
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,904
that has enslaved
your mother!

376
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,981
I call him Gamblor!

377
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:14,526
And it's time to snatch your mother
from his neon claws!

378
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:18,281
(groaning)
Marge! Where are you?

379
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,195
Damn this casino!

380
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,450
(grunts)

381
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:27,667
-(yells)
-Double stars! Everybody wins!

382
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,499
(cheering)

383
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,165
-(grunting)
-Hey!

384
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:35,223
-Seven. Lucky seven!
-(cheering)

385
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:39,139
-Yeah-- Ooh!
-He can't talk now.

386
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,309

387
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,019

388
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,309
<i>-Hey!</i>
-Smithers,

389
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,193
I don't want that unpredictable lunatic
working in my casino.

390
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,521
Fine. We'll transfer him
to the nuclear plant, sir.

391
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,687
Oh, my beloved plant.
How I miss her.

392
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,736
Bah! To hell with this!

393
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,950
Get my razor! Draw a bath!

394
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,581
-And get these Kleenex boxes off my feet!
-Certainly, sir.

395
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:06,329
-And, uh, the jars of urine?
-Oh, we'll hang on to those.

396
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,123
Now, to the plant!
We'll take the Spruce Moose!

397
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,338
-Hop in!
-But, sir-- (gasps)

398
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,128
I said hop in.

399
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,553
(panting, gasps)

400
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,342

401
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,346
(shouting incoherently)

402
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,348
Homer, what is it?
Slow down.

403
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,600
Yer getta ferda redda oura.

404
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,603
Think before you say
each word.

405
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:32,305
-You broke a promise to your child.
-What?

406
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,317
You promised Lisa to help her
with her costume.

407
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,451
You made her cry.
Then I cried.

408
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:43,239
Then Maggie laughed.
She's such a little trouper.

409
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,325
(gasps)
Lisa's costume!

410
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:51,171
(gasps) Homer, I didn't realize.
I'm so sorry.

411
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,300
Marge, I want you to admit
you have a gambling problem.

412
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,129
You know,
you're right, Homer.

413
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,465
Maybe I should get
some professional help.

414
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,010
No, no! That's too expensive.
Just don't do it anymore.

You know, Marge, for the first time
in our marriage,

426
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,165
I can finally
look down my nose at you.

427
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,250
You have a gambling problem!

428
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,745
That's true.
Will you forgive me?

429
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,008
Oh, sure!

430
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,430
Remember when I got caught stealing
all those watches from Sears?

431
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,969
-(groans)
-Well, that's nothing,

432
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,562
because you have a gambling problem!

433
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,968
And remember when I let that
escaped lunatic in the house...

434
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,977
'cause he was dressed
like Santa Claus?

435
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,099
-(groans)
-Well, you have a gambling problem!

436
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:57,437
Homer, when you forgive someone,
you can't throw it back at them like that.

437
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,234
Aw, what a gyp.

438
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,358
