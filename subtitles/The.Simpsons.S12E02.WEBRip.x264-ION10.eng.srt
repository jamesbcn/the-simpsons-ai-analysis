{\an8}Come on, Lise. There's got to be a way

27
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,200
{\an8}to lure that badger out.

28
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,831
{\an8}Well, according to whatbadgerseat.com,

29
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,289
{\an8}"Badgers subsist primarily

30
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,119

31
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,455
{\an8}Hmm, stoats, stoats...

32
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,671
{\an8}Stoats are weasels, Bart.

33
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,880
{\an8}They don't come in cans.

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,800
{\an8}Then what's this?

35
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,588
{\an8}That says "corn," Bart.

36
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,053
{\an8}Must you embarrass me?

37
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,546

{\an8}"In a pinch, badgers have even

{\an8}Perfect! Hey, Todd,

40
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,562
{\an8}can we borrow your woodpecker?

41
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,812
{\an8}I guess so.

42
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,391
{\an8}But we need him back by 6:00.

43
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,936
{\an8}It's his birthday.

{\an8}No, there's a badger in there.

53
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,883
{\an8}Badger, my ass!

54
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,588
{\an8}It's probably Milhouse.

00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,208
{\an8}Milhouse... Milhouse...

{\an8}Or possibly a griffin.

61
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,932
{\an8}Bart, do you have
any dynamite in your room?

62
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:04,847
{\an8}-Tons.
-Get it.

63
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,604
{\an8}No, Dad, we don't want to kill him.

64
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,096
{\an8}Let's call animal control.

65
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,358
{\an8}Great idea.

66
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,149
{\an8}Then we should
call a doctor about this.

67
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,324
{\an8}How did the badger do that
without ripping your shirt?

68
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,532
{\an8}What am I, a tailor?

69
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,445
{\an8}Hmm-hmm. Hmm

{\an8}RECORDED VOICE: <i>Your call</i>
<i>cannot be completed as dialed.</i>

73

<i>the correct area code.</i>

74
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,919
Area code? But it's a local call!

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,920
The phone company ran out of numbers,

76
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,802
so they split the city
into two area codes.

77
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,760
Half the town
keeps the old 636 area code,

78
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,841
and our half gets 939.

79
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,887
939? What the hell is that?

80
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,971
Oh, my life is ruined!

81
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,597
Jeez, you just have to remember
three extra numbers.

82
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,944
Oh, if only it were that easy, Marge.

83
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,400
-(growling)
-Go away!

84
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,770
We got bigger problems now!

85
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,944
I'm not going to stand for this.

86
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,565
I'm going to call
the newspapers, the TV stations,

87
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,533
the gas stations, everybody!

88
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,202

00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,914

91
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,415
HOMER: I hate this new area code.

92
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,127
Like I don't have enough
to remember already.

93
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,467
{\an8}Is that right?

94
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,799
Don't you miss the old 636... Carl?

95
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,596
I'm not sure which one's better.

96
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,270
The six is closer to the three,

97
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,808
so you got convenience there,

98
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,641
But the nine
has less to do with Satan,

99
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,016
which is a plus
in this religious world of ours.

100
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,154
What really burns me up

101
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,400
is they didn't give us
one word of warning.

102
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,322
What do you mean?

103
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,860
They ran those TV commercials about it

104
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,363
and that big radio campaign.

105
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,574
Don't forget the leaflets they dropped

106
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,494
from the space shuttle

107
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,951
and the two weeks we all spent
at area code camp.

108
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,372
Not a single word of warning.

109
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,161
BILL (on radio): And traffic's
all backed up

110

A mattress? Uh-oh!

112
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,330

Oh, it's not fair!

141
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,521
I've been a fan of The Who
since the very beginning

142
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,231
when they were
The Hillbilly Bugger Boys.

143
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,521
You should call that radio

00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,555
Good idea!

covered with dynamite.

156

First, let me reassure you

157
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,425
your fears are groundless

158
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,259

It's a movie, Dad.

Quiet, honey, daddy's asking

You're probably thinking,

174
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,917
"Sure, more area codes are great

175
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,289

the extra hidden fees,

176

all those numbers?"

00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,631
Well, scientists have discovered

179
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,586
that even monkeys
can memorize ten numbers.

180
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,758
Are you stupider than a monkey?

181
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,057
How big of a monkey?

182
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,350
(laughing)

183
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,683
Of course you're not.

184
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,520
Well, I'm convinced.

185
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,193
A professional-looking film
like that has got to be right.

186
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,776
I agree. Two area codes
is more convenient.

187
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,399
-MAN: I like it.
-Wait a minute,

188
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,985
we haven't heard from me yet,

189
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,240
the nut with the dynamite!

190
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,872
The phone company
is bamboozling you.

191
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,449
(murmuring)

192
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,084
I accuse the phone company

193
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,121
of making that film on purpose.

194
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,325
Well, of course we did.

195
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,374
(all gasping)

196
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,877
Now, I'm not one to make trouble,

197
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,879
but it seems to me that everyone

198
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,131
who got to keep the old,

199
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,882
or classic 636 area code,

200
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,135
lives on the rich side of town!

201
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,178
Ooh, poppycock.

202
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,851
-I never!
-Eh.

203
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,719
And, as usual,

204
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,476
we Joe 12-packs

205
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,058
get the royal screw job.

206
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,104
Homer's right!

207
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,477
We're getting the Joan Collins special.

208
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,114
(clamoring)

209
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,442
Well, I've had it!

210
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,032
You rich snobs aren't
pushing us around any more!

211
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,783
And what are you pathetic slobs
going to do about it?

212
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,276
Well, I...

213
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,621
(grunting)

214
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,829
Huh?
(grunting)

215
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,504
Oh, nice wiring, Bart.

216
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,962
It worked on the test corpse.

217
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,042
OK, plan B.

218
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,997
Fellow 939-ers,

219
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,508
I say we break off
and form our own city!

220
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,180
(all cheering)

221
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,588
- MAN 1: Yes!
- MAN 2: We're with you, Homer!

222
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,136
Come on! Let's go!

223
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,010
-(all cheering)
-(in Spanish) <i>Viva la revolucian!</i>

224
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,517
HOMER (in English): No, who's stupid.

225
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,360
There, we're officially a city.

226
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,109
Now we just sit back
and wait for an NFL franchise.

227
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,324
(whistling)

228
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,823
Say, I couldn't help but overhear.

229
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,775
I represent the Arizona cardinals...

230
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,445
-Keep walking.
-Mmm.

231
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,195
Good decision there, Homer.

232
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,745
You showed a lot of poise.

233
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,538
Yeah, maybe you ought
to be mayor of New Springfield.

234
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,083
Mayor, eh?

235
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,384
(gunshots)

236
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,093
{\an8}NARRATOR: <i>The Mayor.</i>

237
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,263
{\an8}<i>Starring Homer Simpson.</i>

238
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,888
I reluctantly accept

239
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,970
this highly-paid glamorous job.

240
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,228
MAYOR QUIMBY:
Presenting our new plaque.

241
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,138
(all cheering)

242
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,556
I say the time for bitterness
has passed.

243
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,939
Let us extend to our brothers
in New Springfield

244
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:26,943
the olive branch of...

245
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,864
-(groans)
-New Springfield rocks!

246
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,533
(all laughing)

247
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,105
Go ahead and laugh.

248
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,776
We have a better town bird.

249
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,584
Oh, yeah? What is it?

250
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,738
The bluebird.

251
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,580
-Damn it.
-More wheatcakes, Mr. Mayor?

252
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,623
Read my lips... Yes.

253
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,248
Dad, you got syrup on your sash.

254
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,630
No problem.
(grunts)

255
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,552
If you ask me...

256
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,459
HOMER: Stop right there.

257
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,717
It's stupid to divide the city

258
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,758
over something
as silly as an area code.

259
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,302
It'd be like
you and Mom splitting up

260
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,845
every time you have a fight.

261
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,308
Sweetie, you know your mother and I

262
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,258
only stay together

263
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,927
for the sake of my political career.

264
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,096
That's not true.

265
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,894
Big grins.

266
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,097
Mwah!

267
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,016
That'll play great in the sticks.

268
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,771
(slurps)

269
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,937
(hums)

270
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,857
Oh, that was 50 already?

271
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,646
Go long!

272
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,236
(grunts)

273
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,540
Hey, look what I found,

274
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,211
a novelty flying disc.

275
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,579
BART: Give it back.

276
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,125
That's my novelty flying disc.

277
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,588
You're in Olde Springfield now.

278
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,301
Everything on this side
of the park belongs to us.

279
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,931
Hey, his pants are in our park, too.

280
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,009
Get him!

281
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,013
(grunting)

282
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,677
(laughing)

283
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,181
My homework is in your park.

284
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:44,983
Let's do it!

285
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:45,981
Yoink!

286
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,309
What's does freedom mean to me?

287
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,187
APU: All right, root beer, bananas

288
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,574
and toilet paper.

289
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,991
50% out-of-towners' tax.

290
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,320
Out-of-towner tax?

291
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,744
I'm sorry, Mrs. Simpson,

292
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,332
but we have to charge
you foreign devils more.

293
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,408
All right, but this better be

294
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,504
the best toilet paper I've ever had.

295
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,079
Oh, no worries there.

296
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,674
That's Henderson's toilet paper.

297
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,959
Oh, why didn't you say so?

298
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,503
Hey, is there a bathroom here?

299
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:11,626
Not for you.

300
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:12,672
(grumbles)

301
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,090
MARGE: I don't know why,

302
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,434
but I just didn't feel comfortable

303
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,510
until I was back here
in New Springfield

304
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,545
with my own kind.

305
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,638
Mom!

306
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,022
They were looking at me

307
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,271
with their eyes.

00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,961
(all cheering)

359
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
Eureka!

360
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,128
<i>With the money made from the gold,</i>

361
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,630
<i>Olde Springfield was able to buy</i>

362
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,131
<i>the Evian water factory</i>

363
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,303
<i>and fly it over here from France.</i>

364
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,551
Oh!

365
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,933
Thanks, Mayor Simpson.

366
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,929
Because of you, we're all
taking golden showers.

367
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,312
-(crew laughing)
-What?

368
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,479
We can't go on fighting
with Olde Springfield.

369
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,939
These people are our neighbors.

370
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,729
We see them every day.

371
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,733
You're right.

372
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,364
We've got to block them
from our sight

373
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,480
with a giant wall.

374
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,146
Like the one in Berlin?

375
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,568
Good idea.

376
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,283
We should call the guys
they used.

377
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,783
(tri-tone beeps)

378
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,287
Homer.

379
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,829
{\an8}It's ringing.

380
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,162
(tri-tone beeps)

381
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,292
And I'd like to thank
Low Ball Construction

382
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,496
for building this amazing wall

383
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,967
from 90% recycled material.

384
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,928
(scattered applause)

385
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,589
-I'm so conflicted.
-About what?

386
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,138
Loyal citizens of New Springfield,

387
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,019
you stayed on my side of town

388
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,230
despite a total lack
of hospitals and schools

389
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,975
and a sewage nightmare

390
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,363
that threatens to consume us all.

391
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,650
How do we get our food?

392
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,993
All the roads are blocked.

393
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,068
(murmuring)

394
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,492
Don't worry.

395
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:27,161
We have plenty of supplies
to get through tomorrow.

396
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,700
And then a wave of disease
should help to...

397
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,865
Hey!

398
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,833
Stop streaming over the wall!

399
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,123
At least wait till I'm through talking.

400
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,707
OK, now, as for food,

401
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,672
the following breeds of dog are edible.

402
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,382
-See ya!
-(Barney) Bye, Homer!

403
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,382
(grunting)

404
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,054
Oh! I can't believe

405
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,553
all those rats fled my town.

406
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,847
I guess it's just us
and the tumbleweeds.

407
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,683
Oh!

408
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,064
BART: Well, Dad,

409
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,817
you're mayor of a ghost town.

410
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,729
Oh, I can't believe

411
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,567
those traitors abandoned us.

412
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,782
They couldn't take one lousy famine.

413
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:06,783
(grunts)

414
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,569
Dad, you're bleeding.

415
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,117
No problem. (grunts)

416
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:16,076
Anyhow, those rats
will come crawling back.

417
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,035
{\an8}(chuckles)

418
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,754
{\an8}We've got The Who playing here tonight.

419
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:23,045
{\an8}Dad, the arena's in Olde Springfield.

420
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,050
D'oh!

421
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,011
{\an8}Don't give up, Dad.

422
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,300
{\an8}Maybe we can get The Who
to play here, instead.

423
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,096
{\an8}Hey, maybe we could.

424
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,101
{\an8}But we'll need some liquid persuasion.

425
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,941
(grunts)

426
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,519
Come on, Bart. We're going
to bring back The Who.

427
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,435
(kissing)

428
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,442
(moaning)

429
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,361
(elevator bell dings)

430
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,951
-HOMER: Ohh...
-Can I help you?

431
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:55,957
Uh...

432
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,578
Dad, the chloroform.

433
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,535
Huh?

434
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,464
Oh, right.

435
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,957
I'll give you this bottle
of chloroform

436
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,134
-if you'll take us to The Who.
-D'oh.

437
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,973
Oh, so you want to see
The Who, huh?

438
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,468
Well, I'll take you to The Who.

439
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,182
Here's your Who!

440
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,429
(both grunting)

441
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,264
I thought we fired that guard.

442
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,018
Oh, yeah, right.
I got fired by The Who.

443
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,641
Whatever you say, pal.

444
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,767
(whistles)
Wacko.

445
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,074
Wow, The Who!

446
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,482
(chuckles)

447
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,316
(grunts)
Whoo!

448
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,822
Rock and roll!

449
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,275
(grunts)

450
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,993
What the hell are you doing?

451
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,203
(chuckles) Duh.

452
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,372
Trashing the hotel room.

453
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,580
But we promised
the desk clerk we'd be good.

454
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,621
Yeah, we don't want to lose
our pool privileges.

455
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,535
Whatever.

456
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,042
The point is, I'm Homer Simpson.

457
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,535
The mayor of New Springfield?

458
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,746
That's right.

459
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,046
{\an8}The crazy mayor of New Springfield?

460
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,590
That's right.

461
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,553
And I implore you to move
your concert to our town.

462
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,094
Don't play Olde Springfield.

463
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:56,018
Or, as it is sometimes known, Sun City.

464
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,348
{\an8}But we have a handshake agreement

465
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,603
{\an8}with a concert promoter

466
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,354
{\an8}and that's a sacred bond.

467
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,186
ALL: Sacred bond.

468
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,271
Come on, what happened
to the angry, defiant Who

469
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,777
of "My generation,"
"Won't get fooled again"

470
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,570
and "Mama's got a squeeze box"?

471
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,113
We know our songs, Homer.

472
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,906
But those Olde Springfield squares

473
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,780
are just going to make you
cut your hair,

474
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,947
turn down your music,

475
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,695
and wear frilly shirts
like Keith Partridge.

476
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,157
Keith Partridge?

477
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,669
Who huddle.

478
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,169
(muttering)

479
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,749
We'll do it.

480
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,209
Yeah!

481
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,717
Just send a cab for us.

482
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,048
Why, is something wrong with your legs?

483
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,393
{\an8}You're right. The walk will do us good.

484
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,101
I opened for The Who at Woodstock.

485
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,682
I came out in a Beatle wig
with a ukulele.

486
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,268
Hendrix said he almost plotzed.

487
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,773
His exact words.

488
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,685
Oh, I never tire of that story.

489
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,185
Smithers, why did you iron

490
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,486
a crease in these dungarees?

491
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,699
I look like a square.

492
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,071
Uh, that crease is in your leg, sir.

493
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,366
Oh, so it is.

494
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:56,696
Yes...

495
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,834
(all yelling)

496
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,913
Hmm, it's not like The Who to be tardy.

497
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:02,827
I'm worried.

498
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,955
-(music playing)
-What's that?

499
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,587
Argh! 'tis The Who!

500
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,214
By my reckoning,

501
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,335
they're in the scurvy depths
of New Springfield.

502
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,427
Homer stole our rock performance.

503
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,336
That fat, dumb and bald guy

504
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,387
sure plays some real hardball.

505
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,431
Who's ready to riot?

506
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,095
(all yelling angrily)

507
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,394
<i>♪ I won't get to get</i>
<i>what I'm after ♪</i>

508
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,560
<i>♪ Till the day I die ♪</i>

509
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,570
How you doing out there,
New Springfield?

510
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,115
(cheering and applause)

511
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,948
To be honest, it's a little chilly...

512
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:38,873
Ow!

513
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,161
DALTREY: Get out of the way, Marge.

514
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,204
We were expecting
a bigger crowd, Homer.

515
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,287
Oh, don't worry, they'll be here soon

516
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,463
and then they'll see
who's got the better town.

517
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,751
Now, these are the tunes
I want you boys to play.

518
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,957
Wait a minute.

519
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,706
Homer, a lot of these

520
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,508
are grand funk railroad songs.

521
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,091
And we don't know "Pacman fever."

522
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,296
Oh, come on, it plays itself.

523
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,257
<i>♪ A Pacman fever ♪</i>

524
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,887
<i>♪ A doodle-ee-do ♪</i>

525
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,484
<i>♪ It's a-drivin' me</i>
<i>a cra-aa-aazy! ♪</i>

526
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,269
Look, Lisa, daddy's in The Who.

527
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,016
Oh.

528
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,187
(chuckles)

529
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,815
(imitating electric guitar)

530
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:13,781
(singing gibberish)

531
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,820
Ow!

532
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,124
Give us back our concert, Simpson!

533
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,698
So, new Springfield's

534
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,703
looking pretty good now, isn't it?

535
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,325
With our ample parking

536
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,582
and daily Who concerts.

537
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,754
-Daily?
-We'll talk.

538
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,172
Yeah, all right, enough chitchat.

539
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,340
Let's see how you like
flaming garbage!

540
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,629
(all yelling angrily)

541
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,593
(grunting)

542
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,139
(singsong)
Ha, ha, you hit the tire fire.

543
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,258
You'll have to do bet...

544
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,104
Ow! Oh, why me?

545
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,390
(screams)

546
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,678
People, please.

547
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,017
What's all this fighting about?

548
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,312
Apparently, they have
two different area codes.

549
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,436
Well, I'll be chuggered.

550
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,732
That's a sticky wicket.

551
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,185
Why not just buy telephones

552
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,435
with auto ring-up?

553
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,396
Or, as you yanks call it,
"speed-dial."

554
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,356
(intrigued murmuring)

555
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,237
Radio shack has some great ones.

556
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,494
Ah, says you.

557
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,619
"Magic bus".

558
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,952
ALL: Yeah, "Magic bus"!

559
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,327
OK, we'll play "Magic bus"

560
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,044
if you tear down this wall.

561
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,337
"Pinball wizard"!

562
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,379
Oh, hell, I'll do it myself.

563
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,848
(power chord)

564
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,929
(plays "Won't get fooled again")

565
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,904
(all cheering)

566
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,648

567
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:37,193

Well, Marge,

570
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,872
looks like
your insane experiment is over.

571
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,410
My experiment?

572
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,703
You're the one who came up
with this whole idea...

573
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,791

574

579
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,741
(whimpers)

580
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,371
(theme music playing)

581
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,832
-(tri-tone beeping)
-Shh!

582
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,660
(tri-tone beeping continues)
