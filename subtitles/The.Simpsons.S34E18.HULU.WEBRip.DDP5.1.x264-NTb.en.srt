Oh, my God.

380
00:16:18,197 --> 00:16:19,467
Ashlee took the things
I told her

381
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:20,908
in new-friend confidence

382
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:25,317
and made it into
a bad boyfriend song.

383
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,589
This has been quite the morning.

384
00:16:27,594 --> 00:16:30,544
But I'm most disappointed
in you, Maggie.

385
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:32,036
Mm? Eh?

386
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:35,379
Evil triumphs
when good babies do nothing.

387
00:16:35,382 --> 00:16:38,762
I'm leaving.

388
00:16:38,761 --> 00:16:41,941
Homer? What happened? Aw.

389
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:44,406
I can't believe
they would do this to me.

390
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:45,679
Hey, could I use

391
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:48,961
your billion-dollar
entertainment complex

392
00:16:48,957 --> 00:16:51,667
to produce a diss track
to take them all down?

393
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,036
You should be careful with that.

394
00:16:53,036 --> 00:16:55,106
When my dermatologist
wouldn't fly to Japan

395
00:16:55,109 --> 00:16:56,649
to remove a culturally
insensitive mole,

396
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,288
I hit him with my single

397
00:16:59,288 --> 00:17:01,628
"Mole Check, Soul Check."

398
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:03,369
It destroyed him.

399
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:05,867
Do you want to do that
to your family?

400
00:17:05,874 --> 00:17:08,254
No. I love them.

401
00:17:08,248 --> 00:17:11,628
Homer, music isn't just
for dissing people.

402
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:13,056
Wha...?!

403
00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:15,043
Why don't we make a video
that tells your family

404
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:15,935
how much they hurt you?

405
00:17:15,938 --> 00:17:18,748
An "I've been dissed" track,

406
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:23,997
- if you will.
- I will.

407
00:17:23,996 --> 00:17:25,996

00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:28,582
Dad's never
stayed mad this long.

409
00:17:28,577 --> 00:17:30,647
Maybe we should
run the can opener.

410
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,659
He always comes
when he hears that.

411
00:17:32,656 --> 00:17:33,656

485
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:56,629
the Murmur Nation has decided
to stop attacking you.

486
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:57,702
My video made you think, huh?

487
00:20:57,703 --> 00:21:00,513
No. It was super cringe,

488
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:02,581
like watching
two teachers make out.

489
00:21:02,584 --> 00:21:04,124
I understand. Been a pleasure
doing war with you.

490

I believed in someone

495
00:21:17,763 --> 00:21:21,613
so much that I got
swallowed up in groupthink.

496
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:24,048
I know. So scary.

497
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:26,318
