A little help?

25
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,673
{\an8}Well, I never thought
it would come to this,

26
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,128
{\an8}but I guess
we'll have to sell

27
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,758
Grandma's Civil War doll.

28
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,554
{\an8}Mom, are you sure
you want to sell

29
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,268
{\an8}a family heirloom
to pay the gas bill?

30
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,979
{\an8}I mean, what would
your grandma say?

31
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,349
{\an8}I'm sure
she'd be proud

32
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,765
{\an8}that her descendants
had piping hot tap water

33
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,824
{\an8}and plenty of warm,
dry underwear.

34
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,148
{\an8}That is so true.

35
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:58,447
{\an8}Hmm, these campaign buttons
are all partisan.

36
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,405
{\an8}Don't you have
any neutral ones?

37
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,825
{\an8}"May the better man win"?

38
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,333
{\an8}"Let's have a good,
clean election"?

39
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,834
{\an8}That sort of thing?

40
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,166
{\an8}No, but we do have
some old shirt buttons.

41
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,752
{\an8}They're kind of kooky
and fun.

42
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:09,877
{\an8}Missy, you just
talked yourself

Hey, Lise, check it out,
pogo stilts.

45
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,811

Wow, an actual robot
from the movie

"Clank, Clank,
You're Dead."

49
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,856
Think of how awful
it would be

50
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,742
for the poor
midget inside.

51
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,899
Oh, boo-hoo.

52
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,527
That's what they
get paid for.

53
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,790

54
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,699
Oh, Homer, look!

{\an8}A TV guide

Oh, you should see
the crossword puzzle.

57
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,788
She thought that Mindy
lived with "Mark."

58
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,798
Give her a break.
Her husband was killed.

59
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,840
Oh, I know.
Wasn't that awful?

60
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,553
Hi, I'm John.
Can I help you with anything?

61
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,433
Yes, I have something
that I'd like to sell.

62
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,851
Please tell me
it's your hair.

63
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:00,849
(giggling)

64
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,970
No. It's an heirloom

65
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,427
my grandmother
passed down to me,

66
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,437
a very rare old figurine
from the Civil War.

67
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,110
Please don't construe
our ownership of this

68
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,979
as an endorsement
of slavery.

69
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,685
Hmm.

70
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,435
Well, see,
here's the thing on this.

71
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,407
It's a Johnny Reb bottle,
early 1970s.

72
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,528
One of the J&R Whiskey
"Liquor Lads."

73
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,776
Two books of green stamps,
if I'm not mistaken.

74
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,158
Oh, no.

75
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,504
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

76
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,250
It's a very,
very old figurine.

77
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,343
No, it's a liquor bottle.

78
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,424
See?

79
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,047
Ah, that will make
your bull run.

80
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,094
(murmuring sadly)

81
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,098
Well, I guess it'll
always be a monument

82
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,310
to Grandma's secret
drinking problem.

83
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,190
Okay, so maybe that thing's
a hunk of junk,

84
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,898
but look at what
you're selling.

85
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,728
50 bucks for a toy?
No kid is worth that.

86
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:55,574
Oh, but this is the Rex Mars
Atomic Discombobulator.

87
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,032
Don't you just love
the graphics on this box?

88
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,992
No.

89
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,663
How you can you love a box
or a toy or graphics?

90
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,702
You're a grown man.

91
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,985
It's camp.

92
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,332
The tragically ludicrous?
The ludicrously tragic?

93
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,166
Oh, yeah.
Like when a clown dies.

94
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,633
Well, sort of...

95
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,052
But I mean more like
inflatable furniture

96
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,971
or "Last Supper" TV trays,

97
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,590
or even this bowling shirt.

98
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,797
Can you believe somebody
gave this to Goodwill?

99
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,677
(murmuring sheepishly)

100
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,144
And that kind of stuff
is worth money?

101
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,564
Boy, howdy.

102
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,642
Man, you should come over
to our place.

103
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,057
It's full of valuable,
worthless crap.

104
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,856
Well, if you're
inviting me over...

105
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,280
I practically insist.
Shall we say 5:00?

106
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,529
The snacking hour?

107
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,660
My heart is palpitating.
Woo-hoo!

108
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,328
Pimento nose and voila.

109
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,579
Mommy's patented
happy-cracker snack platter.

110
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,712
(doorbell rings)

111
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,246
(doorbell rings)

112
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,256
Ding-dong.
Classic.

113
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,008
I mean, that says
it all, doesn't it?

114
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,340
Oh, man, you weren't kidding
about this place.

115
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,547
Well,
I just love it.

116
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,966
Do I know you?

117
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,394
Oh, the color scheme
and the rabbit ears.

118
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,684
And the 2.3 children.

119
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,637
I mean, where's the Hi-C?

120
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,898
Hi-C
and fluffernutters.

121
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,399
Oh!

122
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,320
And pearls
on a little girl.

123
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,319
It's a fairy tale.

124
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,361
Oh.

125
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,195
Oh, I've got the exact
same curtains,

126
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,740
only in my bathroom.

127
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,743
Didn't you just die
when you found these?

128
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,325
Not really.

129
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,000
They just had corn on them.
Kitchen? Corn?

130
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,290
Oh!

131
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,634

132
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,790

133
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,958
Oww!
Why you little--

134
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:43,127
Aaah! Dad! Dad!
Company! Company!

135
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,007
Oh. I'll just be
another minute, John.

136
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,104
Have a seat.

137
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,259
(choking)

138
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,573
So do those records
have camp value?

139
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,358
Everything here does.

140
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,362
You yourself are worth
a bundle, Homer.

141
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,074
Why, I could wrap a bow
around you

142
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,864
and slap on a price tag.

143
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,367
<i>♪ I love the night life</i>
<i>I love to boogie ♪</i>

144
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,079
Come on, Homer,
join the party.

145
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,830
<i>♪ On the disco... ♪</i>

146
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,662
Mom, John loves Itchy
and Scratchy

147
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,167
as much as we do--
Maybe more.

148
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,209
Yeah, and he collects
toy robots.

149
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,253
He is quite a charmer.

150
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,627
Your father's certainly
taken a shine to him.

151
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:25,224
Oh, Homer,
you are the living end.

152
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,011
(both laughing)

153
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,345
Oh!

154
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,639
That John is the greatest guy
in the world.

155
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,233
We've got to have him
and his wife over

156
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,678
for drinks sometime.

157
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,348
Mmm, I don't think
he's married, Homer.

158
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,437
Oh, a swinging bachelor, eh?

159
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,494
Well, there's lots
of foxy ladies out there.

160
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,318
Homer, didn't John
seem a little...

161
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,195
festive to you?

162
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,281
Couldn't agree more.
Happy as a clam.

163
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,657
He prefers
the company of men.

164
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,124
Who doesn't?

165
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,674
Homer,
listen carefully--

166
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,288
John is a ho-mo--

167
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,376
Right.

168
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,090
...sexual.

169
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,340
(screams)

170
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,215
Oh my God, Oh my God,
Oh my God,

171
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,391
Oh, my God!
I danced with a gay.

172
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,470
Marge, Lisa, promise me
you won't tell anyone.

173
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,096
Promise me!

174
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,892
You're being ridiculous.

175
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,476
Am I, Marge? Am I?

176
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,811
Think of the property values.

177
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,145
Now we can never say

178
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,320
only straight people
have been in this house.

179
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,319
I'm very sorry
you feel that way,

180
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,951
because John invited us
all out for a drive today,

181
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,198
and we're going.

182
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,240
Whoa-ho-ho. Not me.

183
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:32,083
And not because John's gay,
but because he's a sneak.

184
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,500
He should have the good taste
to mince around

185
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,959
and let everyone know
that he's that way.

186
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,249
What on earth are
you talking about?

187
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,793
You know me, Marge.

188
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,797
I like my beer cold,
my TV loud,

189
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,469
and my homosexuals
fa-laming.

190
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,679
(horn honking
"Over the Rainbow")

191
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,773
Zzzapp!

192
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:55,769
(gasps)

193
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,437
Homer, at least come out
and say hello.

194
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,810
-No. Nuh-uh. No.
-Oh, come on.

195
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,517
-Oh, no.
-You liked John this morning.

196
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,898
No! I am not setting
foot outside this house

197
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,645
until that man is gone.

198
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,567
Oh! Dad,
you are the living end.

199
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,745
Hey, where'd that cool,
creepy Santa come from?

200
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,541
Japan. Except over there,
they call him

201
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,035
"Annual Gift-man"
and he lives on the moon.

202
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,546
JOHN:
And that's where Kent Brockman

203
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,175
was caught cheating
in the Springfield marathon.

204
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,601
-Whoa.
-Ooh. Oh.

205
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,559
And there's where
Lupe Velez

206
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,390
bought the toilet
she drowned in.

207
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,305
ALL: Oh! Oh!

208
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,814
BART:
That was a killer tour, man.

209
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,437
I never realized
how many celebrities

210
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,324
humiliated themselves
right in our own backyard.

211
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,241
This is a sordid little burg,
isn't it?

212
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,450
Makes me sick
in a wonderful, wonderful way.

213
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,122
-John.
-Oh... Waylon.

214
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,791
I'd like you
to meet the Simpsons.

215
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,369
I know the Simpsons.

216
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,714
So this is your
sick mother?

217
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,000
Don't do this
to me, Waylon.

218
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,455
(laughing)

219
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,758
How'd it go?

220
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,260
Tell me everything
that happened.

221
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,142
He didn't give you gay,
did he? Did he?

222
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,179
Oh, jeez, Louise!

223
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,973
You don't even know
what you're worried about anymore.

224
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,596
John's a witty,
urbane person.

225
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,274
Oh, and I'm not.

226
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,902
Hey, Dad, look
what I got.

227
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:27,359
Zzzapp. Zzzapp.
Zzzapp... Zzzapp...

228
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,740
Bart! Where'd you
get that shirt?

229
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,616
I don't know.
Came out of the closet.

230
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,253
Uh... huh.

231
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,212
I hope
you all saved room,

232
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,092
because I made
your favorite dessert.

233
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:49,088
Store-bought snack cakes--
Both kinds.

234
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,681
Hmm, hmm.

235
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,638
Hmm...

236
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,889
(gasps)

237
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,760
(Homer mumbling)

238
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,479
Homie, I can hear you
chewing on your pillow.

239
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,901
What's wrong?

240
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,439
Marge, the boy was wearing
a Hawaiian shirt.

241
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,194
So?

242
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,066
There's only two kinds of guys
who wear those shirts:

243
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,953
gay guys and big,
fat party animals.

244
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,780
And Bart doesn't look like
a big, fat party animal to me.

245
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,947
So if you wore a Hawaiian shirt
it wouldn't be gay?

246
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,907
Right.
Thank you.

247
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,537
I hope you realize
this is all your fault.

248
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,625
I mean, do you have to be
so effeminate around the boy?

249
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,131
Homer, I don't think
there's a problem with Bart

250
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,223
but if there is,
it's probably because

251
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,259
you're not spending
any time with him.

252
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,643
Good night.

253
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:44,596
("It's In His Kiss" playing)

254
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,765
All right, boy, come on.
Today we're going to--

255
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,864
-(screams)
<i>-♪ Or is it in his face? ♪</i>

256
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,229
<i>♪ Oh, no,</i>
<i>it's just his charm ♪</i>

257
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,937
Gonna what, Homer?

258
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:53,987
<i>♪ Oh, no that's... ♪</i>

259
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,490
(record scratches)

260
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,241
And Helen Lovejoy,
sure, she looks blonde,

261
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,874
but I've heard cuffs
and collar don't match,

262
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,120
if you get my drift.

263
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,582
I don't,
but I loved hearing it.

264
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,293
You!

265
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,543
I should have known.

266
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,924
Well, good morning,
sunshine.

267
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,210
Homer, John brought us
cactus candy.

268
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,054
Look, John, you seem like
a perfectly nice guy and all.

269
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,050
Just stay the hell away
from my family.

270
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,642
Well, now you don't
get any candy.

271
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,808
-No, that's cruel. Take a teensy piece.
-No.

272
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,598
Homer, what have you
got against gays?

273
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,603
You know. It's...
It's not... usual.

274
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,556
If there was a law,
it would be against it.

275
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,226
Oh, Homer, please--
You're embarrassing yourself.

276
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,145
No, I'm not, Marge!

277
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,204
They're embarrassing me.
They're embarrassing America.

278
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,568
They turned the navy
into a floating joke.

279
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:42,406
They ruined all our best names,
like Bruce and Lance and Julian.

280
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,413
Those were the toughest
names we had.

281
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,155
Now they're just... uh...

282
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,628
-Queer?
-Yeah, and that's another thing.

283
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,789
I resent you people
using that word.

284
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,627
That's our word
for making fun of you.

285
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,674
We need it.

286
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:00,757
Well, I'm taking back our word,
and I'm taking back my son.

287
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,555
Don't worry, boy.

288
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,558
We're going to
set you straight.

289
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,179
By tomorrow morning,

290
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,016
you'll be a regular
Burt Reynolds.

291
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,351
What are you talking about,
Homer? Where are we going?

292
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,647
Just a couple of good,
old-fashioned manly places...

293
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,691
Father and son.

294
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,404
<i>HOMER'S BRAIN: You're leaving</i>
<i>the arm there too long.</i>

295
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,614
<i>You want</i>
<i>to make it worse?</i>

296
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,655
<i>No! No! He'll know</i>
<i>you're onto him.</i>

297
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,909
<i>Quick, shake his hand.</i>

298
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,700
Just remember, son,

299
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:26,043
whatever happens
I'll always love you.

300
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,080
<i>As? As?</i>

301
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,003
As a father. A father.

302
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,171
Regular father.

303
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,249
Whew.

304
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,264
What am I supposed
to do here?

305
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,010
Nothing.
Just sit. I'll be back.

306
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,555
Well, it's been two hours.
How do you feel?

307
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,185
I don't know.
I kind of want a cigarette.

308
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,483
That's a good start.
Let's get you a pack.

309
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,647
What's your brand?

310
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,695
Anything slim.

311
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,359
Okay, that didn't work.

312
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,527
But I know
something that will.

313
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,736
(machinery clanking)

314
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,657
Bart, I want you
to shake hands with--

315
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,116
What's your name, fellow?

316
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,786
-Roscoe.
-Roscoe, here, runs this mill.

317
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,125
He's going to show us around

318
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,750
and let you get
a first-hand look

319
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,956
at real, all-American Joes
doing what they do best.

320
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,418
Why the hell would
I want to see that?

321
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,378
You'll thank me
on your wedding night.

322
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,428
Hey! Listen up!

323
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,268
I want all of youse to say
hello to the Simpsons.

324
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,774
TOGETHER:

325
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,066
(gasps)

326
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,359
Has the whole world
gone insane?

327
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,823
(lisping) Stand still.
There's a spark in your hair.

328
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,244
Get it, get it!

329
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,992
(whimpering)

330
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,704
Hot stuff
coming through.

331
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,365
Dad, why did you bring me
to a gay steel mill?

332
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,124
I don't know.

333
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,786
This is a nightmare!

334
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,794
You're all sick!

335
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,706
Oh, be nice.

336
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,415
Oh... My son doesn't stand
a chance.

337
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,756
The whole world's gone gay!

338
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,131
(factory whistle)

339
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,337
Oh, my God,
what's happening now?

340
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,717
We work hard,
we play hard.

341
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,845

342
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,142

<i>♪ Everybody dance now! ♪</i>

345
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:27,032
And the entire steel mill
was gay.

346
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,526
Where you been,
Homer?

347
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,577
Entire
steel industry's gay.

348
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,161
Aerospace, too,
and the railroads.

349
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,617
And you know what else?
Broadway.

350
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,838
I always thought
Bart would grow up

351
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,498
to be just like us.

352
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,627
What happened?

353
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,593
Oh, it ain't
no mystery.

354
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:46,393
Whole modern world's got
a swishifying effect on kids today,

355
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,468
and their MTVs
and their diet sodas

356
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,434
ain't going to set them
straight neither.

357
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,394
You got to do it yourself,
Homer and you gotta do it fast.

358
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,595
What would turn Bart
into a man fast?

359
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,766
You have to think for me.

360
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,524
Well,
let's see now...

361
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,726
Time was, you'd send
a boy off to war.

362
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,396
Shooting a man
would fix him right up,

363
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,114
but there's not even
any wars no more

364
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,534
thank you very much,
Warren Christopher.

365
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,494
Better yet,
Bart could shoot a deer.

366
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,695
That's like shooting
a beautiful man.

367
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:12,825
Hey, he's right,
Homer.

368
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,752
After the boy
bags a deer,

369
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,000
all the diet sodas in the world
won't turn him back.

370
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,542
Then you just
sit back

371
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,496
and watch the grandkids
roll in.

372
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,296
Hunting, eh?

373
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,469
(laughter)

374
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,305
(growling)

375
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,602
Stand aside, Marge.

376
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,483
I'm taking the boy
deer hunting.

377
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,730
He's going to grow up
straight for once.

378
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,612
What?
You never went hunting before,

379
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,609
and you're
perfectly straight.

380
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,941
Oh, yeah? How long
since you've had a baby?

381
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,897
But, Dad,
it's barbaric.

382
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,237
How does killing a deer
make you more of a man?

383
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,163
It just does.
Name me one gay Indian.

384
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,121
Uh-oh. Something's
going to die.

385
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,412
Butt out, buttinsky.

386
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,325
What would you know
about hunting?

387
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,043
I know this much.
I wouldn't wear that hideous hat.

388
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,503
Here. Take this one.

389
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,543
It was worn
by Yale Summers in "Daktari."

390
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,547
Hang on to it, toy-boy
you might need it

391
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,089
when it starts
raining naked ladies.

392
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,470
Today you're going
to be a man, Bart.

393
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,394
You guys going
to teach me to drive?

394
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,433
Oh, yeah. Let a twinkle-toes
drive Betsy. Right.

395
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,438
(nervous laughing)

396
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,689
No, boy.

397
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,560
You can't drive.
You're only ten.

398
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,727
You're going hunting.

399
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,066
You ever been hunting
before, there, Barty?

400
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,741
Nope. Something
about a bunch of guys

401
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,280
alone together
in the woods...

402
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,324
Seems kind of gay.

403
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,874
That is a very immature
attitude, young man.

404
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,870
Remember, guys, the truck
only holds six carcasses,

405
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,038
so don't shoot nothing
but trophy bucks, huh?

406
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,638
Aw, we should have
just stayed at the bar

407
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,604
and shot some rats.

408
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,104
Hey, those ain't
your rats, Barn.

409
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,936
Well, Homie, you ready
to call it quits?

410
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,902
Oh, but... Wait a minute.

411
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,152
Bart's not fixed yet.
He hasn't even...

412
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,074
Homer...

413
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,573
Ohh...

414
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,873
Come on, don't take
it so hard, Homer.

415
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,463
You still got
that other kid--

416
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,538
Uh... Lisa.

417
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,043
Let's, uh, take her out
hunting tomorrow,

418
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,665
make her into a man.

419
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,922
Aw, she'd never go.

420
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,843
She's a vegetarian.

421
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:31,931
Oh, jeez! Homer, jeez!

422
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,049
You and Marge ain't
cousins, are you?

423
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,466
No. This whole thing
is my fault.

424
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,846
I've been a lousy Dad.

425
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:43,773
(gasps)

426
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,114
Cheer up, Homer.

427
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,519
Christmas is coming
early this year.

428
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,582
JOHN: Did he say
where were they going?

429
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,870
No. They were just going
to find a deer

430
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,584
and make Bart
shoot it.

431
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,634
Deer? Ha!
Not around here.

432
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,128
They all migrated north

433
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,130
when the state park
converted to astroturf.

434
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,672
But if there's
no deer out there

435
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,375
then what are they hunting?

436
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,045
The only thing around here
that's even close to deer is...

437
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:24,731
Hey, boy, wake up.

438
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,612
Your old man
found some deer.

439
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,518
Huh? You did?

440
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,487
Wait, man,
those are reindeer.

441
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,620
-(gun cocks)
-Yeah. And it's your shot, son.

442
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,538
What? I'm not going to shoot
a reindeer in a pen.

443
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,698
Come on, Bart.

444
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,707
Be a sport
and kill Blitzen, okay?

445
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,119
Dad!

446
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,087
Aw, criminy,
here come the waterworks.

447
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,708
Bart, I'm going
to turn my back,

448
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,415
and when I turn around,
I want to see

449
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,125
a whole pile
of dead reindeer!

450
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,222
(loud bang)

451
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,973
That a way, son!

452
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,135
You made your old man proud.

453
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,484
I didn't do anything.

454
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,599
(bang)

455
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,145
Hey, they're going nuts

456
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,108
like in those nature films!

457
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,608
Ah, must be mating season.

458
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,612
(all screaming)

459
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,704
Dad, I'm scared.

460
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,954
Me, too, son.

461
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,752
No, don't.

462
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,212
You have to protect
yourself!

463
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,552
Son, there comes a time
in every father's life

464
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,548
when he must...

465
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,339
(grunting)

466
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,761
Dad, are you hurt?

467
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,393
Just my bones and organs.

468
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,521
-(snorts)
-(grunting)

469
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,640
D'oh!

470
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:51,185
("Jingle bells" playing)

471
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,693
MECHANICAL VOICE:
<i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>

472
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,645
<i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>

473
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,736
What the--

474
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,411
<i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>

475
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,739
Bart, look!
It's Santa Claus!

476
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,165
Whoa! It's Santa,
all right,

477
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,788
and he is kicking ass!

478
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,625
MECHANICAL VOICE:
<i>Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!</i>

479
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,802
It's a miracle!

480
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,421
JOHN: No-- Ultrasuede
is a miracle.

481
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,547
This is just good timing.

482
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,797
(groaning)

483
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,887
Oh, Homie, I'm so glad
you're safe.

484
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,853
Hmm, you feel softer
than before.

485
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,555
I've been tenderized.

486
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,015
How'd you know
that thing would work?

487
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,114
Well, the sound
is just brutal,

488
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,900
and I figured reindeer
would naturally be afraid

489
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,153
of their cruel master,
Santa Claus.

490
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,486
I mean,
wouldn't you be? Ha!

491
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,661
Is it okay to come out now,
Mr. Gay Man, sir?

492
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,662
I'll do anything
you say. Anything.

493
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,915
Aw, Moe, we were saved
by a sissy.

494
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,210
Yeah, yeah.
We'll never live it down.

495
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:57,634
Oh, boy, it looks like
it's suicide again for me.

496
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,384
Hey! We owe this guy,

497
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:02,506
and I don't want you
calling him a sissy.

498
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,934
This guy's a fruit,

499
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,473
and a...
No, wait, wait, wait.

500
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,097
Queer, queer, queer.

501
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,694
That's what you like
to be called, right?

502
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,559
Well, that or John.

503
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,226
This is about
as tolerant as Dad gets,

504
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,614
so you should be flattered.

505
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,821
Great!

506
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,740
Well, Homer,
I won your respect

507
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,949
and all I had to do
was save your life.

508
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,529
Now, if every gay man
could just do the same,

509
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,775
you'd be set.

510
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,026
Amen to that.

511
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,575
You know, Bart,

512
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,785
maybe it's just
the concussion talking,

513
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,335
but any way you choose
to live your life

514
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,090
is okay with me.

515
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,511
Huh?

516
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,469
(whispering)
He thinks you're gay.

517
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,140
He thinks I'm gay?
