{\an8}-(alarm buzzing)
-Ahhh!

15
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,109
{\an8}Num-num, Maggie. Num-num.

16
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,777
{\an8}Did somebody say "num-num"?

17
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,118
{\an8}(groans)
I can't get Maggie to eat.

18
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,252
{\an8}Maybe if <i>you </i>try...

19
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,458
{\an8}Oh, I'm 26 hours late for work.
No time for Maggie.

20
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,792
{\an8}Ooh, <i>Where's Waldo! </i>No. No.

21
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,956
{\an8}This would be a lot easier
without all these people.

22
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,755
{\an8}Nope. Nope. (gasps)
It's there! Oh. Nope.

23
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,630
{\an8}-Homer!
-Waldo, where are you?

{\an8}<i>and the sidewalks filled</i>

28
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:31,396
{\an8}Hey! How'd you like
a <i>Details </i>magazine up the wazoo?

HOMER: Oh, sure, single me out.

32
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,538
{\an8}All right, smart guy,
where's the fire?

33
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,622
Over there.

34
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,127
{\an8}(fire alarm ringing)

35
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,875
{\an8}OK, you just bought yourself
a 3-17,

36
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,093
{\an8}pointing out police stupidity.

37
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,684
{\an8}Or is that a 3-14?

38
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,678
{\an8}Nah, nah, 3-14 is a dog,
uh, in...

39
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,351
{\an8}No, or is that a 3-15?
You're in trouble, pal.

40
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,311
(crow caws)

41
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,734
(panting and chuckles)

42
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,810
{\an8}I'd hate to see the look
on old Burnsie's face

43
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,976
{\an8}If he knew I was
just getting in. (chuckling)

(clearing throat)

45
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,492
Hmm... who is that?

46
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,621
Big, ugly nose,

47
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:22,948
bald, liver spot,
liver spot. Hmm...

48
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,828
(clearing throat)

49
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,665
{\an8}-(cash register ringing)
-Turn around, Simpson.

50
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,592
(screams) No!
I can't get in trouble

51
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,670
If I can't see you.

52
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,005
I'm afraid he's got us, sir.

53
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,633
(screams)

54
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,263
(crying hysterically)

{\an8}(panting and sighs)

56
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,972
{\an8}Safe in the core, and now...

57
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,637
{\an8}(gagging)

58
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,936
Don't forget the leg protectors, sir.

59
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,019
Ah, yes.

60
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:52,863
{\an8}(gagging) Ow! (yelps) Ow!

61
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,031
I knew I had those
installed for a reason.

62
00:03:55,109 --> 00:04:00,369
{\an8}-(grunting)
-(yelling and gagging)

63
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,752
Aw, this is the worst day ever.

64
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,329
Hey, Homer, what gives?

65
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,584
Mr. Burns is making me eat
all these drums of toxic waste.

66
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,128
Geez, that's rough.

67
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,301
There must be 200, 300 gallons in here.

68
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,010
Yeah, and even a teaspoon
could cause a fatal tumor.

69
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,593
Hey, you want to come
bowling with us tonight?

70
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,717
OK.

71
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:26,058
(phone ringing)

72
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,270
Hello?

73
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,850
Homer? Where are you?

74
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,395
You promised you were going to have
a tea party with Maggie.

75
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,073
<i>HOMER: Oh, Marge,</i>
<i>I'm sorry. I can't make it.</i>

76
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,440
A cooling tank just blew

77
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,447
and they're taking Lenny to the hospital.

78
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,529
Oh, no, not Lenny!

79
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,574
Not Lenny!

80
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,698
Yeah, so I'm going to have to work late

81
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,115
instead of seeing you and the kids,

82
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,453
which is what I really want.

83
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,538
OK. Sure.

84
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,252
Kids, turn off the TV.

85
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,714
I have some bad news about Lenny.

86
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,506
BOTH: Not Lenny!

87
00:04:58,965 --> 00:04:59,965
(laughing)

88
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,889
Hey, Carl, check out
the overhead scoreboard.

89
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,183
(both laughing)

90
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,853
"Poo." Uh, Homer,

91
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,561
what wacky name do you want?

92
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,061
Are "poo" and "ass" taken?

93
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,273
-Yeah.
-Damn!

94
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,312
Could my life get any worse?

95
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,475
Simpson! Ugh!

96
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,565
Even for a bowler, you're fat!

97
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,860
Hey, guys, is it normal

98
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,783
to see Burns's face
on a bowling ball?

99
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,202
Uh, actually,
I'd say you're having

100
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,610
a severe psychotic episode.

101
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,158
Aw, what a rotten day!

102
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,445
(grunts)

103
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,914
Wow, a strike.

104
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,128
Hey, if that's psychotic,
then why am I taking these?

105
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:42,053
(groans) You're polishing bone!

106
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,769
Hey, Homer,
that's four strikes in a row.

107
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,388
You've got a perfect game going!

108
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,385
-Really?
-Careful what you say, Lenny.

109
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,897
-You'll jinx it.
-Oh, right. Sorry.

110
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,150
LENNY: Miss! Miss!

111
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,782
Sorry, I was calling the waitress.

112
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,649
Uh, this split you sold me
is making me choke.

113
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,157
-Lenny...
-What?

114
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,948
I paid $7.10 for this split.

115
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,532
Will you at least call it
a banana split, you dumbwad?

116
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,078
Hey, spare me your gutter mouth.

117
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,082
(groans) Ow!

118
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,014
Practice ball, practice ball.

119
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,350
Real, real, real, real, real!

120
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,506
Whoo-hoo!

121
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,347
<i>Kids, today we have to talk about</i>

122
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,274
<i>Krusty brand Chew Goo</i>
<i>gum-like substance.</i>

123
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,154
<i>We knew it contained spider eggs,</i>

124
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,691
<i>but the hantavirus,</i>

125
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,494
<i>well, that really</i>
<i>came out of left field.</i>

126
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,236
<i>So, if any of you have experienced</i>

127
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:48,241
<i>numbness or comas,</i>
<i>send proof of purchase</i>

128
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:52,084
{\an8}<i>and five dollars</i>
<i>to "Antidote, P.O. Box 14...</i>

<i>live from Barney's Bowlarama</i>

130
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,174
{\an8}<i>where local pinhead Homer Simpson</i>

131
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,710
{\an8}<i>Is on the verge of a perfect game.</i>

132
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,593
{\an8}Hey, there was no accident
at the plant.

133
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,881
{\an8}Dad just wanted to go bowling.

134
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,005
He shouldn't have deceived me,

135
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,102
but I'm just so relieved Lenny's OK.

136
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,764
This could be the greatest
individual achievement

137
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,268
In the history of Springfield,

138
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,890
which proves just how pitiful
this town is.

139
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,902
(scoffing) Morons.

140
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,940
CROWD (chanting): Homer! Homer!

141
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,573
Homer!

142
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,903
(cheering)

143
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:31,028
Whoo-hoo! I'm ten pins away
from perfection!

144
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,196
Now, listen, your father
really needs to concentrate,

145
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,458
so we'll just stay here
and not disturb him.

146
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,167
{\an8}Why won't they come over?

147
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,962
{\an8}I'm so lonely.

148
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,915
This is it, folks,
the ball that will determine

149
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,966
whether Homer Simpson rolls
a perfect game

150
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,589
or a pathetic two-ninety-something.

151
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,137
(mumbling)

152
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,847
(chuckles) What's wrong, Abe?

153
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,937
This is as fast as I can move.

154
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,829
Get down, get down.

155
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:44,398
Whoo-hoo! This is
the greatest day of my life!

156
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,153
MAN: Ow!

157
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,324
(all cheering)

158
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,242
You did it, Homey.

159
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,366
In your face, to-do list!

160
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,453
(crowd chanting)
Homer, Homer, Homer...

161
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,578
Thank you. Thank you.

162
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,285
But there was someone else
with me on that alley.

163
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,956
I'm talking about the big man,

164
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,045
Carl.

165
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,669
Aw, can the corn, bonehead.

166
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:11,588
(Marge scoffs)

167
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,809
Children, today's local hero
is Homer Simpson.

168
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,928
(cheering)

169
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,425
Mr. Simpson bowled
a perfect game

170
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,188
without the aid of steroids,
crack, angel dust

171
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,441
or the other narcotics

172
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,072
that are synonymous
with pro bowling.

173
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,529
Thank you, Bart's teacher.

174
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,073
You know, kids, my teachers said

175
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,815
I would never amount to anything.

176
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,407
And until last week,
they were dead right.

177
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,373
But now I've achieved perfection.

178
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,712
Hmm...

179
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,585
Any questions?

180
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,298
Yes, Bart's weird friend.

181
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,089
Will you be my dad?

182
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,132
(laughs) You've got a father.

183
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,836
He's just a dud. Next question.

184
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,803
Yes, the girl Bart has a crush on.

185
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,136
(groans)

186
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,391
Do you think I could grow up
to be a doctor?

187
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,683
Hey, this was supposed
to be about me.

188
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,057
Now, any other questions?
Pumpkin face?

189
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,442
Head gear? Chicken pox?

190
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,822
Smelly? Lazy eye? Spiky head?

191
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,072
OK, class dismissed. Rock on!

192
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,494
(cheering)

193
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,702
Want to split the birthday cupcakes?

Hey. Hi, Ron. (grunting)

199
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,050
There's a stairway, dumbass.

200
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,050
(laughs) OK, we'll start with
our returning champion,

201
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,133
Disco Stu.

202
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:39,757
Disco Stu's going to groove up
some dough playing tic-tac-toe.

203
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,727
Stu, we like to downplay
the resemblance to tic-tac-toe.

204
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,518
{\an8}I can dig it. Hit me
with the center square.

-KENT BROCKMAN: Uh, Homer.
-Yes, Kent?

206
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,071
According to <i>Redbook </i>magazine,

208
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,528
Well, that...
(stammering) Wait, uh...

209
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,743
Do I read from the sheet
labeled "jokes" or "answers"?

210
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,703
Oh, for the love of--
Stop tape.

211
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,374
Make me center square, Kent.

212
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,702
I'm ready. I can handle it.

213
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,907
Dream on, Drunky.

214
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:04,956
{\an8}Oh, that's it.

215
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,999
{\an8}You're going down. Ugh!

216
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,883
(gagging)

217
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,919
Stop it, you two.
You're making Scratchy cry.

218
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,634
Oh, we've got to stop putting
these flavors of the month on.

219
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,715
-Flavor of the month? Me?
-Yeah, Homer.

220
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,392
You can't just ride
one accomplishment forever.

221
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,971
Why do you think I stopped acting

222
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,346
and became a director?

223
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,432
I don't know.

224
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,807
Because you weren't cute anymore?

225
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,603
Hmm... I'll agree.

226
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,397
Circle gets the square.
Good night, everyone.

(gagging)

228
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:39,199
Now, before my partner, Teller,
hits the shark-infested water

229
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,161
I'll need to borrow
someone's crossbow.

230
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,831
I only need one.

231
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,584
Now, to save my partner's life,

232
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,536
-I'll need complete--

You idiot.
You'll ruin everything.

235
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,182
I'm doing a walk-on.

236
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,759
It's a show business thing.

237
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,466
So, how are you all doing?

238
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,144
Let's see,
what's in the news today?

239
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,683
Will you shut up?

240
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,056
Hey, I thought you never talked.

241
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,983
Uh... I didn't mean to.
(chuckles nervously)

242
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,521
It just slipped out.

243
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,274
Oh, God.
Now Penn's going to beat me.

244
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,527
{\an8}(laughs) Folks,
it's all part of the act.

245
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,609
No, it isn't.

246
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,034
Don't leave me alone with him.

247
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,162
{\an8}You've ruined the act.
I'm going to kill you.

248
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,239
He'll do it.
I'm not the first Teller.

249
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,333
Remember, Springfield,

Mmm-hmm.

00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,629
Well, the one sure cure
for the blues

is to talk it over
with your life partner.

Geez, Homer, I've never seen
you so depressed.

As your life partner,
I'm very worried.

to dedicate my life to.

help you out, Homer,

340

00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,656
Really? You have children?

351
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,334
Aw, well, look.
Here's some money.

352
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,753
{\an8}No. I don't want your pity
or your money.

353
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,245
{\an8}Usually when you say that,

354
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,125
{\an8}you give the money back.

355
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,672
{\an8}-I do what now?
-Yoink.

356
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:48,968
Listen, boy.

357
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,379
I was wondering if you could use

358
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,297
a little more fatherly attention.

359
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,756
No need, Dad. Over the years,

360
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,136
{\an8}I've learned to find father figures

361
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,392
{\an8}wherever I can.
Construction workers,

362
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,394
{\an8}the Internet, and Nelson here.

363
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,595
If you tie a string
around your finger real tight,

364
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,268
you can make it turn purple.

365
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,646
{\an8}I can see I'm not needed here.

366
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,193
Lisa, honey.

367
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,108
Do you need any help
with your homework?

368
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,486
Sure. You can help me
find three words

369
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,534
where "Y" is the vowel.

370
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,621
I've been so blind.

371
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,956
I'll lavish my attention on Maggie,

372
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,592
the forgotten Simpson.

373
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,878
(in sing-song voice) Maggie.

374
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,881
It's me, Daddy.

375
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,513
Daddy's going to spend
a lot more time with you.

376
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,801
Yes, he is!

377
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,094
Yes, he is!

378
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,547
(speaking goofy gibberish)

379
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,926
(speaking sinister gibberish)

380
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,812
Where's Maggie?

381
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,354
Where's Maggie?

382
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,437
Hey, where is she?

383
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,225
There you are.

384
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,193
Hi, Maggie.

385
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,737
I'm Homey-womey, the Teletubby.

386
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,871
And I'm all man,
in case you heard otherwise.

387
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:58,118
{\an8}Let's see what's on tummyvision.

388
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,792
Ow! Oh, that hurts!

389
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,461
(Homer moaning)

390
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,455
Whee!

391
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,541
Whee!

392
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,836
Don't be scared, Maggie.

393
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,129
Daddy won't drop you.

394
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,262
(pulley squeaking)

395
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,020
You're a tough cookie, Maggie,
but I'm going to win you over,

396
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,022
just like I did with Lisa.

397
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,314
Hi, honey.

398
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,784
OK, dads.

399
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,570
This is where
your child's trust in you

400
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,994
really pays off.

401
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,122
D'oh!

402
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,583
ALL: Come on. Come on.

403
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,119
Come on, Maggie. You can trust me.

404
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,753
Come to daddy!

405
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,160
(grunting baby-talk gibberish)

406
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,167
(sinister grunting)

407
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,713
Oh.

408
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,461
I'm sorry, Maggie.

409
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,046
I never realized things between us

410
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,301
had gotten this bad.

411
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,801
What are you pointing at?

412
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,806
The ocean?

413
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,055
That's a great idea!
We'll swim in the ocean!

414
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,685
See, Maggie?

415
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,112
The ocean is just like a bathtub.

416
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,991
Except instead of rubber duckies,

417
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,778
it has barracudas and moray eels.

418
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:16,913
(chuckles)

419
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,276
(screaming)

420
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,286
Nothing to worry about.
Just a little wave.

421
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,210
And this riptide is certainly

422
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,169
nothing Daddy
can't struggle against.

423
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,209
Help! Help!

424
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,672
Somebody help!

425
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,422
{\an8}(gurgling)
Current... too strong.

426
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,468
{\an8}I know. If I sink to the bottom,
I can run to the shore.

427
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,550
(inhales)

428
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,805
(gasping) Maggie, call Aquaman!

429
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,444
(gurgling)

430
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,166
(gagging and coughing)

431
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,961
Maggie, you're swimming!

432
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,758
You swam out to save me!

433
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,931
Oh, you <i>do </i>love me!

434
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,192
Mr. Simpson,
you're going to be fine.

435
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,941
Although you do seem
to have swallowed

436
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,273
a number of shark eggs.

437
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,358
{\an8}Actually, that was
before I went in the ocean.

438
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,494
Well, I don't want to pry
into your personal life--

439
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,991
{\an8}-Then don't.
-Doctor, how could a little baby

440
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,284
save a full-grown man from drowning?

441
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,698
{\an8}(laughs) It's quite simple.

442
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,287
{\an8}When a parent's life is in danger,

443
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,962
{\an8}a child can summon
superhuman strength.

444
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,171
And all I care about

445
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,591
is that my little girl loves me.

446
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,340
Oh. And we're going to spend

447
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,131
a lot more time together
from now on.

448
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,796
(ball striking pins)

449
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,048
(ball rolling slowly)

450
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,806
Good girl, Maggie!

451
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,646
You knocked down all the pins!

452
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,651
But you stepped over the line
just a little bit.

453
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,364
So I'll have to give you a five.

454
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:24,034
And that gives you
a final score of... 295.

455
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,616
Looks like Daddy won.

456
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,451
But 295 is awfully good
for a baby.

457
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:33,878
Yes, it is. It's very good,
and you're a good little baby.

458
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,419
Yes, you are!

459
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,212
{\an8}(laughing)

460
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,257
(baby talk)

461
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,510
(content hum)

462
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,810
(theme music playing)

463
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,718
Shh!

464
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,059
