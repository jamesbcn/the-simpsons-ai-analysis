{\an8}Grampa! I don't mind

{\an8}but I have to work
with these people.

{\an8}Oh, jabberjack.

{\an8}All right, seniors. We'd all love
to share in your wisdom, experience--

{\an8}Yadda, yadda, yadda.

12
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,054
{\an8}Let's start
with Milhouse's grandfather.

13
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,596
{\an8}Uh, how many of you
have a house?

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,560
{\an8}All right.
Now, how many of you

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,390
{\an8}drove your house
to school today?

16
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,726
{\an8}-(kids muttering)
-Huh?

17
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,361
{\an8}Well, I did.
(chuckles)

18
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,269
{\an8}No, I'm not Superman.

19
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,277
{\an8}I just own an R.V.

20
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,399
{\an8}Me and the new wife
travel the country

21
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,567
{\an8}searching for adventure.

22
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,695
{\an8}Last fall, we won a chili
cook-off in Beaumont, Texas.

23
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,035
{\an8}CHILDREN:
Wow.

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,000
{\an8}You're living in a
fool's paradise, Van Houten.

25
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,081
{\an8}If you fell down in the shower,
that thing would be your tomb.

26
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,707
{\an8}Grampa, hush.
Here, why don't you spit some more?

27
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,206
(chuckles)

28
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,917
No, I'm not Superman.

29
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:31,967
I'm a judge.

30
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,470
Why, just this morning,

31
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,511
I sentenced my 46th man
to death.

32
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,465
Oh-- No, 47th.

33
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,805
(applause)

34
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:43,651
Wow, 47.
I love you, Grampa.

35
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:46,938
Yeah, well-- I may not have
a fancy black bathrobe

36
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,983
and a hammer like Snooty,

37
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,737
but I do have slippers
and an oatmeal spoon. Look.

38
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,860
(kids snickering)

39
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,446
Bart, perhaps
your grandfather

40
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,992
would like to come up front now

41
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,615
and give someone else a chance
to interrupt.

42
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,411
Oh, please, no.

43
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,365
-'Bout time, Knothead.
-Aah!

44
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,575
Now...

45
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,247
Hey, listen!

46
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:11,506
Now, my story begins
in 19-dickety-two.

47
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,339
We had to say "dickety"

48
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,974
'cause the Kaiser had stolen
our word "twenty."

49
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,512
I chased that rascal
to get it back

50
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,516
but gave up after
dickety-six miles.

51
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,519
(Martin chortles)
"Dickety"?

52
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,601
Highly dubious.

53
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,096
What you cackling at, fatty?

54
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,897
Too much pie,
that's your problem.

55
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,192
Now, I 'd like to digress
from my prepared remarks

56
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,527
to discuss how I invented
the terlet.

57
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,033
"Terlet." Ha!

58
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,115
(all laughing)

59
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,450
Stop your snickering.

60
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,945
I spent three years
on that terlet.

61
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,924
And then he claimed
he was the one

62
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,625
who turned cats and dogs
against each other.

63
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,296
Why is he always making up
those crazy stories?

64
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,635
Maybe it's time we put Grampa
in a home.

65
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,181
You already
put him in a home.

66
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,675
Maybe it's time we put him in
one where he can't get out.

67
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,596
No! Old people
deserve our respect.

68
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,845
Look at Jacques Cousteau
and Goldie Hawn.

69
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,147
You wouldn't shut them away
like second-class citizens.

70
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,611
Second-class?

71
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,031
What about Social Security,

72
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,740
bus discounts,
MedicAlert jewelry,

73
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,451
Gold Bond powder,

74
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,371
pants all the way up
to your armpits,

75
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,830
and all those other
senior perks?

76
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, if you ask me,
old folks have it pretty sweet.

77
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:30,674
(groans)
Let's see.

78
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,002
Ehh...

79
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,474
(sighs)

80
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,088
(muttering)

81
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,547
Eh, this junk was hardly worth
getting up for.

82
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,888
Maybe if I go back to sleep
for a few days,

83
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,603
some good mail will build up.

84
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,313
Hey, what's this?

85
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,436
"Asa Phelps has--"

86
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,480
(gasps)

87
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,523
The Seventh Hellfish is dead?

88
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:56,487
That means the fortune's
almost mine.

89
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:08,747
Asa Phelps spent his entire life
in Springfield

90
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,081
except for
four years' service

91
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,247
in World War II,
and one high school day-trip.

92
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,587
He worked at the United Strut
and Bracing Works

93
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,764
as a molder's boy
until he was replaced

94
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,723
by a molder-matic and died.

95
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,738
Would you do the honors?

96
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,956
Well, Simpson,
seven gone.

97
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,668
As soon as you're in
your pressboard coffin,

98
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,709
I'll be the sole survivor,
and the treasure will be mine.

99
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,634
Over my dead body
it will.

100
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,923
That's exactly the point--

101
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,627
Oh, Simpson,
can't you go five seconds

102
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,218
without humiliating yourself?

103
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,473
(boinging)

104
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,182
How long was that?

105
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,517
Your clownish behavior
notwithstanding,

106
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,402
we have made
a gentlemen's agreement

107
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,479
and sworn on our lives
to honor it.

108
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,236
Smithers, I want
that man killed.

109
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,320
(boinging)

110
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,584
Let's see, "mesmerists,
dowsers, luddites,

111
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,212
alienists, Zoroastrians,
alphabetizers--"

112
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,210
Aha! "Assassins."

113
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,592
I was wondering, sir,
do we really need to, uh,

114
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,670
"settle" Abe Simpson?

115
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,466
I mean, I 'm familiar with
his physical state and--

116
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,429
Perhaps if we wait, nature
will assassinate him for us.

117
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,100
Well, I can't risk it.

118
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,469
I won't allow that Simpson boy

119
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,095
to take the Hellfish bonanza,

120
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,062
and I can't get it
without his key.

121
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,392
Ah, just the man I need.

122
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,688
Fernando Vidal, the world's
most devious assassin.

123
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,239
(phone ringing)

124
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,279
<i>Hola.</i>

125
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,492
BURNS: <i>Fernando, it's M.B.</i>

126
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,322
Ah, Marion Barry.

127
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,867
Is it time
for another shipment already?

128
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,911
<i>This is Montgomery Burns.</i>

129
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,325
Oh, <i>caramba.</i>

130
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,713
I'm sending you a photo
over the faxtrola.

131
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,751
I need you to fly to Springfield

132
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,924
and assassinate this man,
post-haste.

133
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,430
Ah, Del Monte.

134
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,762
Enjoy them, old man.

135
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,017
They will be your last.

136
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,269
(snoring)

137
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,914
(alarm ringing)
I'm up! I'm up!

138
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:52,953
Ah, he's more clever
than he looks.

139
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,880
-(buzzing)
-WOMAN (on speaker): <i>Abraham Simpson,</i>

140
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,839
<i>your family is here</i>
<i>to visit you.</i>

141
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,209
Hot diggity, my family's
come to visit me!

142
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,258
Wait a minute.

143
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,341
My family never comes to vi--

144
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,717
(yells)

145
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,100
D'oh, not again!

146
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,482
I can't take much more
of your blundering numskullery.

147
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,231
I'll be in the car, dudes.

148
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,033
There is one more way
to kill a man,

149
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,991
but it is
as intricate and precise

150
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:31,332
as a well-played game of chess.

151
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,078
Was that me,
or was that you?

152
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:48,085
Nurse! Nurse!
Someone's trying to kill me!

153
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,466
Okay, we'll do something
about that right away.

154
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,683
Let's start
by doubling your medication.

155
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,189
The residents...

156
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,189
are trying...

157
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,611
to nap!

158
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,356
(pounding on door)

159
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,652
Let me in!

160
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,355
Someone's trying
to kill me!

161
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:11,155
Sweet merciful McGillicuddy,
you got to open the door!

162
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,490
Who is it?

163
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,575
It's Grampa.

164
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,750
And it sounds like he's gotten
into the horseradish again.

165
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,000
And then a knife flew
at my head,

166
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,793
and you were there--

167
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,417
And you were there.

168
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,085
Uh, Grampa, maybe I should
moisten your washcloth.

169
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,884
It's plenty moist!

170
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,137
Listen, Monty Burns
is trying to kill me,

171
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,640
and it's all because--

172
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,641
Of, um-- I can't tell you why.

173
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,063
Well, I 'm sure
you'll make up something.

174
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,022
Maybe you just need
more of my classmates around.

175
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,852
I got to hole up here
for a while.

176
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,228
They might still be after me.

177
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,646
Wow, he's even more
agitated than usual.

178
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,235
Maybe we should
let him stay.

179
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,610
Where are we going
to put him?

180
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,776
-Bart's room.
-Bart's room.

181
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,244
-Bart's room.
-Dumpster.

182
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,621
Sorry to crowd you, boy,

183
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,496
but I'll let you in
on a secret.

184
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,173
Burns is after me

185
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,922
'cause he wants
the Hellfish bonanza.

186
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,514
Look, if you're going
to stay in my room,

187
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,219
could you at least
stop making up gibberish?

188
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,140
Gibberish, eh?
Then what's this?

189
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,300
Wrinkly gibberish?

190
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,598
Why, you smart--

191
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:22,602
I got this in the
second World War II.

192
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,517
{\an8}Back then, I was known
as sergeant Simpson,

193
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,396
{\an8}and I commanded
the Flying Hellfish--

194
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:32,034
the fightingest squad
in the fightingest company

195
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,833
in the third-fightingest
battalion in the army

196
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,868
and we were all
from Springfield.

197
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:41,082
There was police chief Wiggum's
father, Iggy Wiggum.

198
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:44,583
Um, if anybody finds a grenade
without a pin, that's mine.

199
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,505
Our radioman,
Sheldon Skinner.

200
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,919
All right, very funny.

201
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,798
Well, I didn't join the service
to make friends.

202
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,595
And watching our backs

203
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,679
was private fifth class
Arnie Gumble.

204
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,385
(loud belch)

205
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,725
Then there was also
Griff, Asa, Ox and Etch.

206
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,481
But every unit has
a troublemaker.

207
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:10,744
Ours was a cocky little private
named Montgomery Burns.

208
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,938
(yawns)

209
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,408
Haven't you won the war yet?

210
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,868
Duh, hey, you said you was dead.

211
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,579
Yes, dead tired.

212
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,160
But I 'm quite refreshed now.
Thank you.

213
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,956
Mm-hmm.

214
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,920
You bossed around the richest,
most powerful guy in town.

215
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,671
How come you were a sergeant
and he was only a private?

216
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,924
Well, he got busted down

217
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,086
for obstructing a probe
from J. Edgar Hoover.

218
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,505
We got stuck with him.

219
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,223
(Grampa chuckles)

220
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,925
Now they'll never
save your brain, Hitler.

221
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,524
A little help?

222
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,475
(shells whistling
and exploding)

223
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:53,486
(whimpering)

224
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,449
Boom! Boom, it went.
Boom! Just like that.

225
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,200
They took a photo of my keister
for <i>Stars and Stripes.</i>

226
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:03,334
At least they told me
it was for <i>Stars and Stripes.</i>

227
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,872
Well, if you saved Burns' life,

228
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,615
why does he want to kill you?

229
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,457
It was the closing days
of the war.

230
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:12,092
We had just flushed some Germans
out of an abandoned castle--

231
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:21,853
-Hey, Burnsie found some pictures.
-Wait a minute.

232
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,851
We ain't a-sposed
to steal from civilians.

233
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,143
You want me to report you
to Commander Flanders?

234
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,437
Just leave them, Burnsie.

235
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,150
Leave them for whom,
the Germans?

236
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,820
The folks
who shoot at us all day?

237
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,228
Let's just take them.

238
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,776
We'll all be rich,
rich as Nazis.

239
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,820
-Whoa!
-Yeah.

240
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,203
He's got a point there.

241
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,739
Think of what a guy
could get himself

242
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,623
with that kind of scratch.

243
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,740
I could buy chicken dinners
three times a day.

244
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,077
I could buy a brand new Studebaker
with a fan on the dashboard.

245
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,833
I could buy my way into high--

246
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:48,825
(belches)

247
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,376
...society.

248
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,039
Well, I don't feel
right about it,

249
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,088
but I could use a nest egg
for retirement.

250
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,171
I'd hate to wind up
in one of them old folks' homes.

251
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,218
Then it's agreed.

252
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,971
Of course, we can't sell
the paintings now.

253
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,603
We'd be caught.

254
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,970
How many of you are familiar
with the concept

255
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,307
of a "tontine"?

256
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,231
All right, Ox. Why don't you
take us through it?

257
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:14,403
Duh, essentially,
we all enter into a contract

258
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,993
whereby the last
surviving participant

259
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,489
becomes the sole possessor
of all them purty pictures.

260
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,993
Well put, Oxford.

261
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,374
Now, remember, you can't
all sign with an "X."

262
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,254
GRAMPA:
<i>So we sealed up the paintings</i>

263
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,592
<i>knowing only one of us would</i>
<i>ever look upon them again.</i>

264
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,797
Ox was the first to go.

265
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,803
He got a hernia carrying
the crate out of the castle.

266
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:46,016
Five more men died in the Veterans' Day
float disaster of '79.

267
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,808
Now, with Asa gone,
it's down to me and Burns.

268
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,404
Great story, Grampa.

269
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,899
Could have used
a vampire, though.

270
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,610
'Night.

271
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,650
Oh-- My own grandson
thinks I'm a liar.

272
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,816
(loud buzzing)

273
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:01,815
(yells)

274
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,576
Don't kill me!

275
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,948
I've tried to meet you
halfway on this, Simpson,

276
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,826
but you had to be
little Johnny Live-A-Lot.

277
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,884
Now, give me your key
to the Hellfish bonanza.

278
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,998
Oh, wow.
There really is a treasure.

279
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,505
Whatever you do,
don't give him the key, Grampa.

280
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,758
Here's the key.

281
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,129
Aw-- Figures.
Hey, Mr. Burns!

282
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,637
Can I go with you
to get the treasure?

283
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,138
I won't eat much,
and I don't know

284
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,890
the difference between
right and wrong.

285
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,931
Oh, you're a good boy,
but the child labor people

286
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,726
have been watching me
like a hawk.

287
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,270
Well, I 'm off
to get the paintings.

288
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,233
As they say, time is "Monets."

289
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,693
As you were, Sergeant.
(chuckles)

290
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,364
Oh, terribly sorry.
Back to sleep, little girl.

291
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,195
LISA:
Santa?

292
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,659
Well, I guess Burns
is finally going to be rich.

293
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,617
Not without
the keys, he isn't.

294
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,417
Hey! You got the keys.

295
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,252
Now we can get the treasure.

296
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,007
Oh, what's the use?

297
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,299
Burns would still find
some way to take it from me.

298
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,854
I can't believe you,
Grampa.

299
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,758
The sergeant
in that story you told

300
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,137
would never be scared
of a dork like Burns.

301
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,103
You got to get
that treasure.

302
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,063
You got to do it for Ox and Asa
and Griff and Burnsie.

303
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,064
Well, not so much Burnsie.

304
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:19,356
You really think
I can do it?

305
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,111
Uh-- Yes.

306
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,283
But we got to act fast.

307
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,612
Where are you two
going at this hour?

308
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,778
-On a treasure hunt.
-Oh, can I come?

309
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,657
Only if you're ready
to stare danger in the face,

310
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,664
put your manhood
to the ultimate test,

311
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,496
-and take--
-Pass.

312
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,048
Hey, Grampa, do you think
your dead buddies

313
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,340
get up and walk
around at night?

314
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,724
If they're anything like me,
they have to get up twice.

315
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
Okay, hold up here.

316
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,346
Fellas, it's me, Sarge.
At ease.

317
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,471
I know I'm bending
the rules tonight,

318
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,348
but I also know
none of you wants

319
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,645
that skunk Burns
to take our treasure.

320
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,229
And I want you to know
that when I die,

321
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,236
you're all welcome
to visit me

322
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,159
in rich man's heaven.

323
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,957
(rumbling)

324
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,643
Now it's going to show us
exactly where to dig.

325
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,096
TOGETHER:
D'oh!

326
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,108
Boy, you borrow us
some diving equipment

327
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,651
while I borrow this boat.

328
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,606
Well, howdy-doodily,
stranger.

329
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,236
Couldn't help but notice
you stealing my boat.

330
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,743
I'll bring it back.

331
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,044
-You ever operated
a power boat?
-No.

332
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,328
-Know anything
about water safety?
-No.

333
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,872
-What do you need it for?
-It's a secret.

334
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,376
Sounds spine-tingly-dingling.

335
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,539
Just promise you'll
have a good time.

336
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,378
Maude, boys, come on up.

337
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,173
We're going to have
a camp-out in the dinghy.

338
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,177
KIDS:
Yay!

339
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,428
Now, remember the plan, boy.

340
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,096
If you run out of air,
tug on the rope--

341
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,185
64 times. No more,
no less. Got it.

342
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,690
No, 63 times
if you're out of air.

343
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,113
64 is if you've
found the treasure.

344
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,532
Gotcha.

345
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,070
Hey, Grampa,
do you think

346
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,243
I could have been
a Flying Hellfish?

347
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,202
You're a gutsy daredevil
with a give-'em-hell attitude

348
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,243
and a fourth-grade
education.

349
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,157
You could have made sergeant.

350
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,431
(gurgling)
Wow!

351
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,277
Sixty-one,

352
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,162
sixty-two,

353
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,529
sixty-three!

354
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,746
Oh, no, 63!

355
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,288
He's out of air!

356
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,961
I've sent my only grandson
to a watery--

357
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,791
Sixty-four!

358
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,376
He found the treasure!

359
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,711
I'm rich!

360
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,143
You're one heck
of a grandson, boy.

361
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,140
Now let's break her open
and have a look-see.

362
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,988
Huh. The light must
have burned out.

363
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,414
I'll thank you to stop
pinching my Botticelli.

364
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,992
(gasps)

365
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,117
Looks like I didn't need
the keys after all.

366
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,254
I'll take the masterpieces,
thank you.

367
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,371
Consarn it.

368
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,917
You coward.

369
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,255
You're an embarrassment
to the name Hellfish.

370
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,841
Oh, am I?

371
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,926
No. Look, take
the art if you want.

372
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,971
Just don't hurt the boy.

373
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,215
Hmm-- I'd rather do both.

374
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,771
(gasping)

375
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,945
So long, Sarge. See you
at the reunion in November.

376
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,456
(gasping)

377
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,338
(gurgling)

378
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,361
I'm sorry I cost you
your fortune, Grampa.

379
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,164
The fortune
doesn't matter, boy.

380
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,199
The important thing
is you're safe.

381
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,624
Now let's get that fortune!

382
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,995
They're gaining on us, sir.

383
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,001
We'll have to jettison
something.

384
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,668
It's been an honor
to serve you, sir.

385
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,297
Consarn it,
he's getting away.

386
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,052
In a pig's eye he is.

387
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,694
Act your age, Simpson.
You look foolish.

388
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,214
Don't kill me.

389
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,869
I ain't gonna kill you.

390
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,997
That would be cowardly,
Monty Burns cowardly.

391
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:15,455
I just want to watch
you squirm.

392
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,837
Yes, sir.

393
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,844
Is this to your liking?

394
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,546
(grunting)

395
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,060
Now, Burnsie,
there's one thing

396
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,930
we don't stand for
in the Hellfish

397
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,437
and that's trying to kill
your commanding officer.

398
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,019
So consider this
your dishonorable discharge.

399
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,896
You're out of my unit,
you're out of the tontine,

400
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,114
and that means
the paintings are mine.

401
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,405
Private, you are dismissed.

402
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,500
You're rich, Grampa.
You did it.

403
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,618
And Burns can never
take that away from you.

404
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,576
(sirens wailing)

405
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,417
Freeze. U.S. State Department.

406
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,963
We'll take those.

407
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,376
We've been helping
the German government

408
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,474
search for this stolen art
for 50 years.

409
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,469
To avoid
an international incident,

410
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,101
we'll be returning it
to the descendants

411
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,678
of its rightful owner.

412
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,184
Baron von Wortzenburger,

413
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,227
on behalf of the American
people, I apologize--

414
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,900
<i>Ja, ja, ja--</i>
<i>mach schnell mit</i>
<i>der art things, da?</i>

415
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,321
I must get back
to <i>dancecentrum</i> in Stuttgart

416
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,530
in time to see Kraftwerk.

417
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,530
Hey, und, <i>dummkopf,</i>

418
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,122
watch out for the C.D. changer
in my trunk, huh?

419
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,408
Idiot.

420
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,412
(techno-pop playing)

421
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,415
I guess he deserves it
more than I do.

422
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,838
Well, at least
I got to show you

423
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:38,208
I wasn't always
a pathetic old kook.

424
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,627
You never were, Grampa.

425
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:46,006
Oh, I'd hug you, but I know
you'd just get embarrassed.

426
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,556
I won't get embarrassed.

427
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,219
I don't care who knows
I love my Grampa.

428
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,476
Hey, fun boys, get a room.
