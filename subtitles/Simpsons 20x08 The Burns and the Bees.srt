1
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,674
The Simpsons

2
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,318
D'oh!

3
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:14,607
Sir, we're two minutes
from landing at the billionaire's retreat.

4
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:17,143
Ah! My favorite week of the year.

5
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:21,648
Sophisticated financial discussions
with my fellow plutocrats.

6
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,716
Food fight!

7
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:29,744
Take that, Ted Turner.
In your face, founder of Facebook!

8
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,437
Skinny dip!

9
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,540
Yee-haw!

10
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,612
MAN: Gangway!

11
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,352
'Men.' The room for me.

12
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,503
Nice prank, Simpson.

13
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:20,273
I dare you to dump that bees' nest
on those second-grade babies.

14
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,408
Why would I want to?

15
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:26,246
Because I said, 'I dare you.'
Kearney, can you read it back?

16
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,648
'Nice prank, Simpson. I dare you to...

17
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,184
'dump that bees' nest
on those second-grade babies.

18
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:34,387
'Bart: Why would I want to?
Jimbo: Because I said, 'I dare you.'

19
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,156
'Kearney, can you read it back?

20
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:39,025
'Kearney, reading: Nice prank, Simpson.
I dare you to...'

21
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:43,196
The point is, Simpson,
a dare has been placed on your nards!

22
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,296
My nards accept!

23
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,834
Stingamajigs!

24
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,203
Save yourselves!

25
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,310
Huh?

26
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,678
Where are the bees?

27
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,837
No bees?
- Dare annulled.

28
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,616
Can I appeal?
- Yeah. Appeal to other guys,

29
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,716
Captain Wuss!

30
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:12,951
Other than the birth of my kid,
this is my happiest moment.

31
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,994
All the bees are dead!

32
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:20,033
Aye, lass. The bees are dying,
and not just here. All over the world.

33
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:24,638
From Glasgow clear to Edinburgh.
And no one knows why.

34
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,918
I've lost a lot of wee friends of late.

35
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,088
Willie, I didn't know
you were an apiarist.

36
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,958
From context, I can tell
that means beekeeper.

37
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:49,028
'Tis a tragedy, Lisa.
No man should outlive his bees.

38
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,253
They're stinging God now.

39
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:12,080
And the call from the SEC...

40
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:16,520
...was coming from inside
their own brokerage house!

41
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,359
Jeff Bezos wet his pants!

42
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:23,114
I did not.
That was apple juice from before!

43
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,232
I fold.
- I raise a million dollars.

44
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:29,302
And to sweeten the pot,
my assistant, Smithers.

45
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,138
If you lose me, sir, may I say
what an honor it's been to...

46
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,908
Bets don't talk. They see and raise.

47
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:41,014
Well, if we're betting people,
I got a whole herd of them.

48
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:45,449
My professional basketball team,
the Austin Celtics.

49
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,223
Well, they're hardly worth a Smithers.
But we don't have all night.

50
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,416
Can you beat nine high?

51
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,793
Damn! Eight high!

52
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:59,059
So I own a basketball team, do I?

53
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,994
Take good care of them, Burnsie.

54
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:03,570
Don't let the forwards
mix with the guards.

55
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,174
And if they're acting sluggish,
slip some steroids into their cocaine.

56
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,274
Mmm-hmm.

57
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,914
Fortune Four Lotto numbers are nine...

58
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,449
Knew it.
- Seven...

59
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:17,517
Duh.

60
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,618
Three...
- What?

61
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,420
And...
- Boring.

62
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,590
Dad, we have to do something!
All the bees are dying!

63
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,784
Oh, no! No bees? Ooh!

64
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:30,563
Now who will sting me
and walk all over my sandwiches?

65
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,966
But, Dad, bees pollinate flowers.

66
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:36,569
Flowers.
The painted whores of the plant world.

67
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,669
No bees means no honey.

68
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:51,217
Synthetic honey, just like you remember.

69
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,418
Honey?

70
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,257
Thank you.

71
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,332
D'oh!

72
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:10,095
I never dreamed the future could be scary.

73
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,371
Let's go, Lisa.

74
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,140
We've got some worms to save.
- Bees.

75
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,043
Worms, bees, ticks,
fleas. Let's go, go, go!

76
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,811
I'm glad you called me.

77
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,848
I know I'm not the first scientist
in the phone book.

78
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,250
That's Associate Professor Aaron Ableman.

79
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,885
How I hate him.

80
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:30,235
Thundering thorax!
It's just exactly what I feared!

81
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,259
In there. Close. See these red dots?

82
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,564
This bee has been felled by bee measles.

83
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,224
Or as I call it, beesles.

84
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,202
Animals can get sick?

85
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,571
I'm going to talk to the girl from now on.

86
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,907
You're the nerd.
- What we need to do now...

87
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:51,644
...is find enough uninfected bees
to start a healthy colony.

88
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,719
This pheromone should attract them.

89
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,951
Marry me, and I'll support you for life.

90
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,487
You're not a bee! This thing is useless.

91
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,823
There's one on Lisa.

92
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,662
Hold still, sweetie. Daddy will kill it.

93
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,596
And this time, no screw-ups.

94
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,103
Stop! Stop! It's an uninfected queen!

95
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,472
How do we catch her without hurting her?

96
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:23,209
Unfortunately, the best method
is to allow her to sting you.

97
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:27,013
Yeah. Much like that.
Now squeeze around the stinger...

98
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,990
...to keep her attached,
and a colony of bees...

99
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,065
...will soon form around your face.

100
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:41,027
Now just keep them there
until the colony is healthy and thriving.

101
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,428
How long is that?

102
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:46,299
Long enough that you will be known
as Springfield's crazy bee girl.

103
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,399
She likes the stingers!

104
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,939
Marge, remember when we were
talking about our worst fears?

105
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,006
Mmm-hmm.

106
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,975
And mine was snakes, and yours was...

107
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,677
Never being a grandmother.

108
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,446
Really? I thought
it was Lisa with a beard of bees.

109
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,181
Well, whatever. Brace yourself.

110
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:11,858
President Lincoln, you've come back!
And you got rid of that hat!

111
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,958
You've got my vote!

112
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,365
Lisa, I don't like this at all.

113
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:22,435
It's not for long.
But until they find a suitable habitat,

114
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:25,171
this beard is the only
hope for these bees.

115
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:30,116
Relax, Mom. I'll mold them
into a shape you know and love.

116
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,258
Stop Milhousing your sister!

117
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,817
Now take it off before they sting you.

118
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,553
Actually, bees rarely sting
when they're in a cluster.

119
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,989
They only attack to defend their hive.

120
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,459
I don't know.
All it takes is one troubled Ioner.

121
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,639
Please let me keep them
for just a little longer.

122
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,265
Okay. One night.

123
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,340
So let's see how my burly-bottomed
ball handlers are faring.

124
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,807
Smithers, we're leading two to nothing.

125
00:09:05,907 --> 00:09:09,562
Run out the clock,
boys. Run out the clock.

126
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,855
Oh, yeah! Three points!
Big three in the Big D for the Big C!

127
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,955
Mark Cuban, that's me!

128
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,894
Who is that man? And why isn't
his enthusiasm being punished?

129
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,029
That's Mark Cuban, sir.

130
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,869
He's the most flamboyant owner
in the league.

131
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,401
I'm out of my mind!

132
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,841
How odd. His money seems to have
bought him happiness.

133
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,080
I'd like to meet him, Smithers.

134
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,216
So you made your money in nuclear power?

135
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,451
I can't remember how I made my money!

136
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:49,422
If you're really a billionaire,
give me the secret billionaires handshake.

137
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,490
Smithers, turn away.

138
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,038
Hey!

139
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,612
So tell me, why don't you
recoil from the public...

140
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,013
...like a normal billionaire?

141
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,316
Hey, why own a basketball team
if you're not gonna have any fun?

142
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,952
'Fun'? Is that how it's pronounced?

143
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,787
I've only seen it written.
- Hold that thought.

144
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:25,625
No one's paid attention to me
for 10 whole seconds.

145
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,964
It's time for this peacock
to show his feathers.

146
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,366
You know, the feathers with the big eye...

147
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,901
...that trick them
into thinking that's my front?

148
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,976
Said feathers are what I'll flaunt!

149
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,342
Mom, maybe you shouldn't have put
so much syrup on the pancakes.

150
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,747
The secret is not to swallow the stingers.

151
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,718
Dad, don't eat the bees!
- They're just drones, Lisa.

152
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,921
They only live for like
five minutes anyway.

153
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:58,891
And they only have haploid cells,
not diploid, like me and Bart!

154
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,359
Yeah!
- Listen, Lisa,

155
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,195
I was trying to think of a way
to help your bees.

156
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,266
And I remembered this abandoned
greenhouse outside of town.

157
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,702
Which used to be a beautiful
thriving greenhouse...

158
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,352
...till I was hired to run it.

159
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:16,042
Your bees will have plenty of room
in this old greenhouse.

160
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,209
Plus, there are flowers.

161
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,713
And it's near a prison,
so they'll have a place to sting people.

162
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:24,016
Oh, Mom, it's perfect! Go live your lives!

163
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,116
Get off my face!

164
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,255
I miss them.

165
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,024
Now you know how I'll feel
when you go to college.

166
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,259
You'll always have Bart,

167
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,360
always.

168
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,964
But he'll be gone a lot,
repairing refrigerators.

169
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,832
Always.

170
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:42,168
ANNOUNCER ON PA: Ladies and gentlemen,

171
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:45,071
please welcome your new fun-Ioving owner.

172
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:48,207
You've seen him on the cover
of the December 1943 issue...

173
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:53,472
...of Collier's Magazine,
Montgomery Burns!

174
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:04,090
Silence! Now let's make some noise
for everyone's favorite basketball team,

175
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,100
whom I have renamed
the Springfield Excitement!

176
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,127
I knew it!

177
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,733
Now I would like to sing
our national anthem.

178
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,434
My country 'tis of thee

179
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:20,837
Austria, Hungary

180
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,374
Obey your king...

181
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:24,710
...Sir, the Archduke is dead.

182
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,579
What? The Archduke is dead?

183
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,913
And the empire is destroyed.

184
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,582
Then what happened?
- World War I.

185
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,983
Then what?
- World War II.

186
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,385
Then what?
- A postwar period.

187
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,753
Then what?
- The Cold War.

188
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,488
Then what? Then what?

189
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,024
Then what?
- The European Union.

190
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,759
A European union? Good heavens.

191
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,828
MR. BURNS: Ladies,
hold on to your husbands.

192
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,831
It's time for the saucy antics
of Springfield's own

193
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,700
Basket-Belles!

194
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:57,576
Enough of this vulgarity!
Back to your brothel, harlots!

195
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,546
Now enjoy your game and
the madcap antics...

196
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,282
...of the freewheeling
title holder of this asset,

197
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,917
me!

198
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:05,985

199
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:10,681
Hip-Hop hooray! Ho!
Hey! Ho!

200
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,193
Hey! Ho! Hey! Ho!

201
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,662
You drew a picture of my morning

202
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:17,797
But you couldn't make my day...

203
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,968
Sir, were those real bullets?
- Yes. Was that a real gorilla?

204
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,804
No.
- I see.

205
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,543
Sir, your escapades,
while well intentioned,

206
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,878
seem to be driving away our fans.

207
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,814
We have to turn this business around.

208
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,550
Time to think outside the boxiola.

209
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,775
What would Mark Cuban do?

210
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,654
I'm out of my mind!

211
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,059
That's not much help.

212
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,762
Build a new arena, state-of-the-art!

213
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,862
New arena.

214
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,180
That's it, men!
Pave and tar the way God intended!

215
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,282
Mr. Burns, you can't do this!

216
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,486
I can, I shall, and in the future,
I will have done!

217
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,586
I cannot be stopped.

218
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:20,264
Kill his acorns and make him watch.

219
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,564
First, one announcement.
I regret to inform you...

220
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,767
...we are not offering childcare tonight.

221
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,569
I don't know who that guy was
you were leaving your kids with.

222
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:35,402
Now without further ado,
let's get ready to referendum!

223
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:39,278
There's only one place in town
where the bees can survive,

224
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,947
and Mr. Burns wants to tear it down.

225
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,985
Please, people. You didn't listen to me
about the snail darter.

226
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,920
You didn't listen to me about the osprey.

227
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,422
And you didn't listen to me
about the javelina!

228
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:51,924
The feisty pig of the desert?

229
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,893
Apparently not feisty enough.

230
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:58,898
Future generations will judge us
by how we cared for the tiniest creatures.

231
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,634
I am not just asking you to save the bees.

232
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,794
I am asking you to save your souls!

233
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,109
Excellent speech. Just excellent.

234
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:13,913
I no longer wish to build my
magnificent new basketball stadium.

235
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,013
You don't?
- Heavens no.

236
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:19,584
No skyboxes. No kiss cam.

237
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:22,788
Nor will we have the chance to marvel
at number-one draft pick

238
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,618
Muk Mu, the human North Pole.

239
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:31,163
No. I'm afraid he'll be on the
first kayak back to Ketchikan.

240
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,493
ALL: No!
- Please don't take our freak!

241
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,168
I love you, Muk Mu!

242
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,604
Muk Mu! Muk Mu!
- Muk Mu! Muk Mu!

243
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:42,374
All those in favor of building
this decadent monument to excess,

244
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,474
say aye.
- ALL: Aye!

245
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,577
Nay.

246
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:51,617
I know it's not your fault, Muk Mu.
You're a gentle, loving soul.

247
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,298
What's wrong with your bees, Lisa?

248
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,434
Mr. Burns took away their sanctuary.

249
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:13,379
And now they aren't strong enough
to survive on their own!

250
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,942
I'm going home.
Give me the keys to my bike lock.

251
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,011
Are you sure?
- Give me the keys!

252
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:22,348
Okay, okay. I don't know why I had them
in the first place.

253
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,555
I'd do anything to
cheer up my little girl.

254
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,558
Really? Listen, Homer. In the back room,

255
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,094
I got these super tough Africanized bees.

256
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:38,731
I saw this ad in a gentlemen's magazine
for excited African honeys,

257
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,065
and that's what they sent me.

258
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,268
If we could combine them with Lisa's bees,

259
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,970
it would make them strong enough
to survive any environment.

260
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,207
But how are we supposed to
combine the DNA of two strains...

261
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,942
...of the same species?

262
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,042
Actually, Homer...

263
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:57,948
You and me?
- No. The bees!

264
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,252
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's what I meant, too.

265
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,617
I have no inclination.

266
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,158
Got the queen?

267
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:12,378
Yup. And she's ready for a night of
anonymous sex with multiple partners.

268
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:19,538
Now let's give 'em some privacy
while they get down to 'buzziness.'

269
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,141

270
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,972
Come with me, my love

271
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:31,074
To the sea The sea of love...

272
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,583
...If they was me,
they'd be done by now.

273
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,460
Wow, this must be important, Dad.

274
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,396
I've never seen you walk up
an incline before.

275
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,733
Sweetie, I have a very special
surprise for you.

276
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,833
My bees?

277
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,870
Your bees died days ago!

278
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,140
These are their angry mutant descendants!

279
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,377
And they're tough enough to
live in any environment.

280
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,246
They sound awfully mad.
Are they dangerous?

281
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,982
Hmm. I'm not sure. Let me check.

282
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,082
Are you guys dangerous?

283
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,089
A simple 'yes' would've sufficed!

284
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:13,483
Don't worry, Lisa.
Where else are they gonna go?

285
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:18,476
To that new stadium
that looks exactly like a hive!

286
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,869
Welcome to the American dream.

287
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,971
A billionaire using public funds...

288
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:31,341
...to construct a private playground
for the rich and powerful.

289
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:35,614
And now, so our skybox owners
can really enjoy the game,

290
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,978
I shall let in the sky!

291
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,488
Stop! I am one of you!

292
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,331
We've been invaded by a swarm
of killer bees.

293
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,267
My microphone is no microphone at all.
It's bees!

294
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:58,937
Am I being badly stung? Yes. And it hurts.

295
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:20,756
Our bullets are useless!
Okay, they're useful on me.

296
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,690
Oh! They've found a home!

297
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,838
You've won this round.
But when next we meet,

298
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:36,237
the beekeeper will be the beekeepee.

299
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,315
Help me, Muk Mu!

300
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,399
So that's how I was outfoxed...

301
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:52,958
...by a little girl and
her halfwit companion...

302
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,794
...when my beautiful stadium
was declared a bee sanctuary,

303
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:59,164
and I had to take a third-quarter
write-down of 804 million dollars.

304
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:02,749
Wait a minute!
Someone crunch the numbers!

305
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:07,761
He's only worth $996,036,000!

306
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,609
He's not a billionaire at all!

307
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,878
Wait, wait, wait!
It's only a matter of four million.

308
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:18,418
I'm sure I can find that somewhere.
I have $50 here in my wallet.

309
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:22,087
Mark, can you get me off the hook
for old times' sake?

310
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,187
Can't do it, Monty.

311
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,428
Don't worry.
You'll feel a lot more comfortable...

312
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,326
...in the millionaire's camp.

313
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,831
No! No! Just kill me now!

314
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,307
Howdy do!
I own a minor league hockey team!
