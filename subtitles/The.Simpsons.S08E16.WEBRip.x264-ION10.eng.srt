{\an8}<i>Well, Krusty,</i>

{\an8}<i>after I tried to frame you</i>
<i>for armed robbery,</i>

36
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,308
{\an8}<i>I tried to murder</i>
<i>Selma Bouvier.</i>

37
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,811
{\an8}<i>Let's see-- I rigged</i>
<i>the mayoral elections,</i>

38
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,564
{\an8}<i>I tried to blow up Springfield</i>
<i>with a nuclear device,</i>

39
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,937
{\an8}<i>and I tried to kill you.</i>

40
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,573
{\an8}<i>Oh, yeah, yeah.</i>

41
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,030
{\an8}<i>And whenever I could find</i>
<i>a spare moment,</i>

42
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,610
{\an8}<i>I've tried to murder.</i>

43

{\an8}<i>Bart Simpson.</i>

{\an8}(yelling)

45
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,946
{\an8}He said, "tried."

46
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:00,996
{\an8}Someone should
really go up there

47
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,959
{\an8}and talk to him.

48
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,000
(sighs)

49
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,173
Whew.

50
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,961
Homer!

51
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:12,224
Oh,
all those stairs...

52
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,968
Oh, you have nothing
to worry about, honey.

53
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,432
Your mother's right,
Bart.

54
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,392
Sure, you're the one
who ruined

55
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,722
all of Sideshow Bob's
criminal schemes--

56
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,598
We're very proud
of you, by the way.

57
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,975
And sure, he's probably
so insane with rage

58
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,323
that he'd butcher you
horribly if he could.

59
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,729
But he's
safely locked away.

60
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,568
In a medium-security prison.

61
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,783
-For life.
-Unless he gets out somehow.

62
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:35,953
Which is impossible.

63
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,620
Or so you think,

64
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,779
except he's done it
so many times before.

65
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,198
Thanks for trying, guys,

66
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,496
but Sideshow Bob
wants me dead,

67
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,790
and Sideshow Bob

68
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,673
is an unstoppable
killing machine.

Yes.

81
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,871
I'm a good, good man.

82
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,502
You know, it's hard to believe
this model prisoner

83
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,870
could be the same
monstrous fiend

84
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,876
who once ran for mayor.

85
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,038
It's a pleasure
to have recommended you

86
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,837
for the work-release
program.

87
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,881
Me? I'm touched.
I really am.

88
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,005
But you'll never find
anyone willing to hire

89
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,352
a five-time loser like me.

90
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,008
I already have.

91
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,650
Cecil?

92
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,098
Is it really you?

93
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,398
Hello, brother.

94
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,571
I'm happy to see you.

95
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,034
But it's been ten years.

96
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,780
We haven't spoken
since the...

97
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,073
unpleasantness.

98
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,406
You mean
Arthur Fiedler's wake?

99
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,041
No, no, no.
I mean our falling out.

100
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,038
Oh, that.

101
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,999
That's ancient history.

102
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,460
Let's make a fresh start.

103
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,829
Come work for me.

104
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,036
But this is wonderful.

105
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,296
You do know
I used to have a--

106
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,629
(clears throat)

107
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,923
problem with trying
to kill people?

108
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,967
Goodness, I had no idea.

109
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,181
For, you see, I have been
on Mars for the last decade

110
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,892
in a cave with my eyes shut
and my fingers in my ears.

111
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,314
Touché, Cecil.

112
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,312
I'm aware
of your felonious past,

113
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,444
but you are
still my brother,

114
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,731
and blood is thicker
than bread and water.

115
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,975
You don't have to worry
about me, brother.

116
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,937
I'm all murdered out.

117
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,567
Praise the Lord.

118
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,960
(booing and yelling)

119
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,170
Get back in there!
Get back in there!

120
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,501
How can you even think
of releasing Sideshow Bob?

121
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,667
He's just faking it
to get out of jail.

122
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,126
He's a maniac!

123
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,966
Bob is no maniac.

124
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:05,141
He explained his reasons
for trying to kill us all.

125
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,851
And I assure you,
they were perfectly sane.

126
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,602
Oh, you gotta be kidding!

127
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,854
My friends, please.

128
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,306
I make no secret
of my past.

129
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,357
But isn't our system
of justice

130
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,031
based on the idea
that a man can change?

131
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,740
Have the boys
check into that.

132
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,200
I know I don't deserve
another chance,

133
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,200
but this is America.

134
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:27,202
And as an American,
aren't I entitled to one?

135
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,285
MAN: Probably!

136
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,119
Can't you find it in your hearts

137
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:33,004
just to let me
live and work in peace?

138
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,252
(all agreeing)

139
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,224
Don't you see
what you've done?

140
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,014
Sideshow Bob hasn't reformed.

141
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,467
He's pure evil!

142
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,927
Oh, if only you knew
what he was thinking.

143
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,862
<i>I hope they still make</i>
<i>that shampoo I like.</i>

144
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,826
Now, make yourself
at home.

145
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,753
Perhaps a glass
of Bordeaux?

146
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,211
I have the '82
Chateau Latour

147
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,841
and a rather indifferent
Rausan-Segla.

148
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,629
I've been in prison,
Cecil.

149
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,302
I'll be happy just as long
as it doesn't taste

150
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,881
like orange drink
fermented under a radiator.

151
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,586
That would be
the Latour, then.

152
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:30,597
And God bless Mom and Dad
and Lisa and Maggie

153
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,141
and, please, God,
kill Sideshow Bob.

154
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,346
Bart, no!

155
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,685
It's him or me, o, Lord.

156
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,110
-(grunting)
-Ow!

157
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,728
You can't ask God
to kill someone.

158
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,486
Yeah! You do
your own dirty work.

159
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,453
Well, I suppose I should
ask you what you do

160
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,945
if I'm to be
working with you.

161
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,116
For me, Bob. For me.

162
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,865
I am Springfield's

163
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,287
chief hydrological
and hydrodynamical engineer.

164
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,246
Hydrological
and hydrodynamical--

165
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,256
talk about
running the gamut.

166
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,048
Snigger all you like, Bob.

167
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,972
Thank you.
I believe I shall.

168
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,970
But you'll find
one gets more respect

169
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,722
as a humble civil servant
than as a homicidal maniac

170
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,055
or a clown's sidekick.

171
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,520
Aha! I knew it.

172
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,100
You're still angry that
Krusty picked me instead of you.

173
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,436
I can't imagine
what you mean.

174
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,441
Oh, come now.

175
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,153
You wanted to be Krusty 's
sidekick since you were five!

176
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:27,994
What about the buffoon lessons,
the four years at clown college?

177
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,322
I'll thank you not to refer
to Princeton that way.

178
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,288
The point is you obviously
still blame me

179
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,198
for what happened
at your audition.

180
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,372
(whimpering)

181
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,588
Thanks for driving me,
big brother.

182
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,960
These giant clown mitts
are extremely hilarious,

183
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,007
but do make it
difficult to shift gears.

184
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,011
That's the title of Erma Bombeck's
latest, isn't it?

185
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,473
KRUSTY: Number 73!

186
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,603
You're next.
Make with the laugh-laugh.

187
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
(drum roll, rim shot)

188
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,354
(clearing throat)

189
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,683
(meekly)
Hey, children.

190
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,437
Meet me, Sideshow Cecil.

191
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,610
KRUSTY (imitating buzzer):
Next.

192
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,189
Uh, I have prepared
a pie-in-the-face take.

193
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,025
(groaning)

194
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,820
All right.
Knock yourself out, kid.

195
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:08,824
Hal?

196
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,124
Ooh.

197
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,950
Free comedy tip, slick:

198
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,615
The pie gag's only funny
when the sap's got dignity,

199
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,365
like that guy.

200
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,207
Hey, Hal, pie job for
Lord Autumnbottom there.

201
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,424
Oh, dear.

202
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,415
(laughing)

203
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,257
(applause, laughter)

204
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,303
That guy's a genius!

205
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,596
He's gonna change the way

206
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,769
we think about
getting hit by pies!

207
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,228
Chumley, you're hired.

208
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,306
When that pie hit your face,

209
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,896
I saw my dreams explode
in a burst of cream and crust.

210
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,363
But I suppose
I should thank you.

211
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,613
After all,
it led me to my true calling.

212
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,485
Cecil, no civilization
in history

213
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,623
has ever considered
chief hydrological engineer

214
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,120
a calling.

215
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,412
(clearing throat)

216
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,825
Yes, yes. The Cappadocians.

217
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,174
Fine.

218
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,631
CECIL: There it is--
the future site

219
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,630
of the Springfield
hydroelectric dam.

220
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,973
Just the thought of all
that raw, surging power

221
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,629
makes me wonder why the hell
I should care.

222
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,847
Because you'll be supervising
the construction crew.

223
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:15,969
Oh, great.

224
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,555
Whenever a woman
passes by,

225
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,100
I suppose it will be my job
to lead the hooting.

226
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,853
"Oh, yeah!
Shake it, madam.

227
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,016
Capital knockers!"

228
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,654
Come on, Bob.

229
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,400
This is your chance to show
the people of Springfield

230
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,732
you can hold down
an honest job.

231
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,028
He's planning something evil--
I know it.

232
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,612
It must have something to do
with the town's water supply.

233
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,448
Maybe he's gonna pee
in the river!

234
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,743
Mmm. Nah.
That's not his style.

235
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,252
Who is that?

236
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,250
(gasps)
Why...

237
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,832
it's Bart Simpson!

238
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,587
Hello, Bart!

239
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,170
He's just a little shy because
I've tried to kill him so many times.

240
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,166
Oh.

241
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,005
I really must thank you

242
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,683
for this moment
of tranquility, Edna.

243
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,812
You know, I haven't been
on a date in six years.

244
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,729
Oh, the pleasure's
mine, Bob.

245
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,058
It's so exciting
to be dating a killer.

246
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,314
To be fair, I never
successfully killed anyone.

247
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,567
Oh. I see.

248
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:15,278
I did once try to kill
the world's greatest lover,

249
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:19,084
but then, I realized there are
laws against suicide.

250
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,410
(giggling)

251
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,455
-You get my drift?
-Oh, you.

252
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,499
Mrs. Krabappel, no!
That's Sideshow Bob!

253
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,384
Well,
that's the last time

254
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,801
I announce my dinner
plans in class.

255
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,010
That was Edna Krabappel.

256
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:37,641
You only get one chance
with Edna Krabappel.

257
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,390
I hope you're happy.

258
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,562
I won't be happy
until I find out

259
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,890
what you're up to.

260
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,104
Wherever you go
and whatever you do,

261
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,845
I'll be there
watching and waiting.

262
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,897
He says that, but I bet
he gives up pretty quickly.

263
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,988
Hello, brother.
All's well, I trust?

264
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,372
It most certainly is not!

265
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,699
The workmen you've given me
don't know their asses

266
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:00,994
from the hole in the ground

267
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,327
they accidentally
blew yesterday.

268
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,211
Come now, you speak as if
they were a gaggle

269
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,168
of slack-jawed yokels.

270
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,328
Mr. Terwilliger,
come quick!

271
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,747
There's trouble down to
the "see-ment" mixer, sir!

272
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,837
See, cousin Merl
and me

273
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,133
was playin' fetch
with Geech--

274
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,467
that's our old
smellhound-- and--

275
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,762
Geech gone to heaven,
Mr. Terwilliger.

276
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,927
Oh, cousin Merl, really!

277
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,557
Temper, temper.

278
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,654
You know cousin Merl
ain't been quite right lately.

279
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:29,979
I'm telling you, Cecil,

280
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,524
I can't take
much more of this--

281
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,477
rustic workmen who've
turned the Sanijohn

282
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,027
into a smokehouse...

283
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,821
coveralls that don't
quite cover all...

284
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,366
and a psychotic little boy

285
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,909
who will not stop
hounding me!

286
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,912
This little boy right here.

287
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,714
Sometimes, I wish
this dam would burst

288
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,539
and bury this cursed town.

289
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,762
Hey, you said we were
going to Dairy Queen.

290
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,550
I lied. Now, help me rummage
through Bob's trash for clues.

291
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,184
Then, I promise
we'll go to the water slide.

292
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,392
Okay.

293
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,926
(both screaming)

294
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,597
You again!

295
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,436
Well, that's it.

296
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:14,731
I'm going to do what I should
have done a long time ago.

297
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,487
(knocking)

298
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,163
Madam, your children
are no more...

299
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,200
than a pair of
ill-bred troublemakers.

300
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,446
Lisa, too?

301
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,707
Especially Lisa.

302
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,708
But especially Bart.

303
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,551
If he crosses me one more time,
just once more--

304
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,008
Well, I can't be held
responsible for my actions.

305
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,259
Well, I hope
Bob fed you

306
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,930
'cause I ate
your dinners.

307
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,719
I know it's hard to accept,
Bart, but face it--

308
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,313
Sideshow Bob has changed.

309
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,719
No, he hasn't.

310
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,097
He's more the same
than ever,

311
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,234
and I know
where the evidence is.

312
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,521
There's only one place
it could possibly be.

313
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,355
Bob's trailer at the
construction site?

314
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,230
That's even better.
Let's go there.

315
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,567
What were you thinking?

316
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,241
The haunted mine.

317
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,908
Blueprints...
concrete invoices...

318
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,786
construction schedules...

319
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,173
If I didn't know better,

320
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,789
I'd swear Bob
was building a dam.

321
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,206
Oh, yeah?

322
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,424
Then explain this.

323
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,955
(gasping)

324
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,968
Bart! There must be millions
of dollars there!

325
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,351
What is Sideshow Bob
doing with--

326
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,548
(rattling)

327
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,348
(grumbling)

328
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,311
(roaring)

329
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,271
(screaming)

330
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,314
Who left the lights on?

331
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,477
Who's in here?
Cletus? Cousin Merl?

332
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,897
Big Hungry Joe?

333
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,696
I think he may
have spotted us.

334
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:46,873
Run!

335
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,791
(gasping)
You two.

336
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,001
Be careful.

337
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,831
There's hydroelectricity
in there.

338
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,590
Whoops.

339
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,934
Will you children
stop tormenting me?

340
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,847
I've done nothing wrong.

341
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,016
Give it up, Bob.
We found the money.

342
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,981
Where did that come from?

343
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,106
I've never seen that money
before in my life.

344
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,033
Then you must have
had your eyes closed

345
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,572
when you embezzled it.

346
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,905
I told you, I'm not
a criminal anymore.

347
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,622
You want to know
what I've been up to?

348
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,872
Here's a clue
for you, Jack.

349
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:35,884
100,000 tons of
reinforced concrete.

350
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,841
My God,
it's completely hollow.

351
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,343
What happened
to all the concrete?

352
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,255
You cut back
on building materials

353
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,183
and kept all the money
for yourself.

354
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,182
That's what happened.

355
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,353
Get him, Lis.

356
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,426
But I wasn't in charge
of the money.

357
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,057
Cecil was.

358
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,064
Now, let's stop bickering
and get out of here.

359
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,936
This dam could collapse
at any minute.

360
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:02,743
CECIL: One minute past sunrise,
to be precise.

361
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,818
SIDESHOW BOB:
Cecil?

362
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,283
Once I blow up the dam

363
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,162
there will be no evidence
of missing concrete

364
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,119
and I walk away
with 15 million.

365
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
But everyone will know
you did this.

366
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,076
Perhaps...

367
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,213
or perhaps they'll blame
the master criminal.

368
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,830
You know, the one
who's been working at the dam

369
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,088
and has a grudge
against Springfield.

370
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,630
I know cousin Merl has had
his troubles with the revenuers

371
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,054
but he's hardly a master crim--

372
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,802
Oh. You're referring to me.

373
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,764
Yes. I'm framing you,

374
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,724
and I'm doing a really
excellent job, too.

375
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,434
Wait a minute.

376
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,644
This is all because I got
to be Krusty's sidekick

377
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,935
instead of you, isn't it?

378
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,388
Off the record, yes,

379
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,558
but officially,
I did it for the money.

380
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,017
Speaking of which
hand it over.

381
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,700
Ta.

382
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,994
I forgot to mention,

383
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,946
I'm planning to blow up the dam
with you inside.

384
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,326
Well, obviously.

385
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,673
(lock clicking)

386
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,118
(grunting)

387
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,878
Oh, it's hopeless--
utterly, utterly hopeless.

388
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,841
Oh, I see.

389
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,011
When it's one of my schemes,
you can't foil it fast enough,

390
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,340
but when Cecil tries
to kill you,

391
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:11,045
"It's hopeless-- utterly,
utterly hopeless."

392
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,176
Well, if you kids
aren't going to foil him,

393
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,602
I'll have to do it myself.

394
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,400
Come on, quickly now.

395
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,652
Bart, for once,
I'm not trying to kill you.

396
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,025
I know it's an
awkward situation,

397
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,492
and I don't like it
any more than you do,

398
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,031
but you've got
to trust me.

399
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,834
Ah, what the hell.

400
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,077
(gasping)

401
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,014
(screaming)

402
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,177
(coughing)

403
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,610
Let's go again.
Let's go again.

404
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,650
No!

405
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,903
Come on, children.

406
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,614
Let's go thwart my brother.

407
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,696
<i>♪ I'm on the top</i>
<i>of the world ♪</i>

408
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,742
<i>♪ Looking down</i>

409
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,536

410
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,540

411
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,091
Um, do you know
what you're doing?

412
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,382
Lisa, you don't spend
ten years

413
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,126
as a homicidal maniac
without learning

414
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,427
a few things
about dynamite.

415
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,555
Plunger? Check.

416
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,348
Hard hat? Check.

417
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,892
$15 million and a gun?

418
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,475
Checkmate.

419
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,480
Good-bye, Bob.

420
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,232
No!

421
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,355
Guess who?

422
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,231
Maris?

423
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:54,907
Oh!

424
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,658
Shoot.

425
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,540
Bob, look.

426
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,843
At last, I'm going to do
what Bob never could--

427
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,471
kill Bart Simpson.

428
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,178
By throwing me off a dam?

429
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,258
Isn't that a little crude
for a genius like you?

430
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,305
Ooh, I suppose it is.

431
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,428
If anyone asks, I'll lie.

432
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,926
(screaming)

433
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,847
Bart!

434
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,782
Bart!

435
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:35,908
(screaming)

436
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,084
Cecil...

437
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,912
And now, to kill you.

438
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,867
There may be a slight
ringing in your ears.

439
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,668
Fortunately, you'll be
nowhere near them.

440
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,672
{\an8}I guess this is it.
Thanks, anyway.

441
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,625
You know, I could
snip the wires.

442
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,795
We'd fall to our deaths,
but we'd save the entire town.

443
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,425
Bart, how would you like to do
something incredibly noble?

444
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,144
Do we have to?

445
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,854
Yes.

446
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:04,984
(screaming)

447
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,229
(gasping)

448
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,065
(screaming)

449
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,790
(grunts)

450
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,750
You-- You saved
my life, Bart.

451
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,541
Yeah.

452
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,044
I guess this means you can't
ever try to kill me again, huh?

453
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,377
Oh, I don't know about that.

454
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,632
Joking. Joking.

455
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,505
(sirens wailing)

456
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:45,232
You've brought shame
to this family, Cecil.

457
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,889
Oh, I don't relish
having to write

458
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,647
the Christmas letter
this year.

459
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,309
Nor I to read it.

460
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,767
You know, Bob,
all this time

461
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,437
I thought
you were a bungler,

462
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,195
but destroying the city
is far tougher than I thought.

463
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,115
Here's your man, chief.

464
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,949
Cecil? I think not.

465
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,704
This looks like the work
of crazy old Sideshow Bob.

466
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:06,997
No, chief.
Bob's innocent.

467
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,080
It's the truth.

468
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,285
The truth, huh?

469
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,794
That sounds
like the testimony

470
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,166
of crazy old
Lisa Simpson.

471
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,593
Cecil just voluntarily
confessed, chief.

472
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,132
That's some good work, Lou.

473
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,426
You'll make sergeant
for this.

474
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,388
Uh, I already am
a sergeant, chief.

475
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,349
Perhaps you are,
but I say

476
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,309
Bob goes
back to jail.

477
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,809
But, surely--
I mean, I caught Cecil.

478
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,943
Maybe so,
but Lou here says

479
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,980
you were
resisting arrest.

480
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,443
No, I didn't, chief.

481
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,482
Quiet, Lou, or I will
bust you down to sergeant

482
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,066
so fast, it'll make
your head spin.

483
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,323
Funny, isn't it, Lise?

484
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,534
Those people down there

485
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,454
have no idea
how close they came

486
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,282
to complete destruction.

487
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,550
Marge, I'm going
to look for the kids.

488
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,258
(screams)

489
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,140
I think I wet my bed.

490
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,306
But you can't do this.

491
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,364
I saved
the children's lives!

492
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,188
I'm a hero!

493
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,904
Tell them they'll live
to regret this.

494
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,904
You'll live to regret this.

495
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,027
Oh, thanks a lot.
Now I look crazy.

496
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,950
There they go--

497
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:28,083
two criminal geniuses
locked away together.

498
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,711
Who knows
what diabolical schemes

499
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,289
they might concoct?

500
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,129
You give me--

501
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,386
I'm older.
I get the top bunk.

502
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,548
Oh, poppycock.

503
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,006
I called it
at the arraignment.

504
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,096
Get back.

505
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,939
So, when do
they bring us the menus?

506
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,485
Shh!
