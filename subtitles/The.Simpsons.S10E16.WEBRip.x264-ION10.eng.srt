00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,900

one Saturday a month

67
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,859
Oh!

00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,402
Oh, quit complaining.

normal people would like.

83

Why do you assume that I won't

84
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,601
pick something fun?

85
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,731

-Oh!

quite enlightening.

-Fine. How about--

00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,235
She didn't say it yet.

-Go ahead, sweetie.
-The book fair?

00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,582
Oh, no.

92
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,079
I'm not falling

93

Siamese twins in a jar,

94
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,751
it's not a fair.

00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,078
Oh, this is perfect.

96
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,917
We're going to go
see Marmaduke?

97
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,632
No, the Smithsonian
Traveling Exhibit.

98
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:19,053
It encapsulates America
and makes history come alive.

99
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,513
What? And Marmaduke doesn't?

100
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,803
Sorry, Dad.
My mind is made up.

101
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,597
This is your fault
for trading away your turn.

102
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,232
Just for that,
no dessert tonight.

103
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,228
Trade you my next turn
for your dessert.

104
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,349
-Deal.
-D'oh!

105
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,146
Hey, how come the Smithsonian

106
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,151
needs to be sponsored
by a cell phone company?

107
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,574
I can answer that.

108
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,952
Uncle Sam needs
to spend our tax dollars

109
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,148
on the essentials.

110
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,908
Anti-tobacco programs,

111
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,240
pro-tobacco programs,

112
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,454
killing wild donkeys,
and Israel.

113
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,945
Good old government.

114
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,866
Yeah, but corporate sponsorship

115
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,285
cheapens our nation's
treasures.

116
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,634
Actually, they're Omnitouch's
treasures now.

117
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,590
We bought them during
the last budget crisis.

HOMER (gasping):
Fonzie's jacket!

123
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,607
Who's Fonzie?

124
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,112
"Who's Fonzie?"

125
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,033
Don't they teach you
anything in school?

126
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,952
He freed the squares.

127
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,241
How can they put a prop
from a TV show

128
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,485
next to the Bill of Rights?

129
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,747
So what's so great
about the Bill of Rights?

130
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,709
It guarantees all
of the basic freedoms.

131
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,920
{\an8}Speech, religion,
the right to a speedy trial...

132
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,052
HOMER: Where?
I don't see that.

133
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,338
(gasping) Dad!

134
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,801
Don't do that!

135
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,051
-(alarm buzzing)
-(guns cocking)

136
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,223
Get out of
Archie Bunker's chair! Now!

137
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,102
Relax. I'm just boning up
on the old constitution.

138
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,390
Oh, you're going
to regret that, pinko.

139
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,885
Oh, I am so sick of people

140
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,226
hiding behind
the Bill of Rights.

141
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,021
Look, he got chocolate on it.

142
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,734
I didn't mean to. Look...

143
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,608
Mm-hmm. You just
licked off the part

144
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,363
that forbids cruel
and unusual punishment.

145
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,695
(chuckling)

146
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,200
Beautiful.

147
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,161
Really? That much?

148
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,121
It's going to cost $10,000
to repair that document.

149
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,253
What?

150
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,079
Of course, Omnitouch
understands

151
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,884
that real money doesn't grow on trees.
Not these days.

152
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,088
Finally, a company
that understands my needs.

153
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,420
We sure do.

154
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,585
It's called caring.

155
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,882
So, we're even then?

156
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,585
Not by a long shot.

157
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,715
But I have a solution
that'll work out for both of us.

158
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,803
Especially you.

159
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,518
I don't want
a cellular transmitter

160
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,190
sticking out of my roof.

161
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,848
We prefer to think of them
as "keep in touch towers."

162
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,068
It's called caring, Marge.

163
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,478
Plus, you've increased

164
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,736
Springfield's roaming
capabilities 64%.

165
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,819
You've got to admit, Marge,
that's a lot more roaming.

166
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,074
Oh, I guess.

167
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,199
Hey, this is pretty
comfortable.

168
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,906
That Andy Capp
was on to something.

169
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,417
Ugh. That antenna is an
eyesore.

170
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,090
Just pretend it's a tree,
honey.

171
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,918
Or as we say at Omnitouch,
a "progress tree."

172
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,085
Yeah, well, I hope
it doesn't hum too loud

173
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,594
'cause I have a ton
of homework to do

174
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,836
and if don't finish it by...

175
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:08,927
(screams)

176
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,601
My room!

177
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,466
What? I heard a yell.

178
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,768
Did you touch a wire?

179
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,941
What happened to my room?

180
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,059
Nothing. They just
needed a place to put

181
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,857
all the electronic gizmos

182
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,070
and I know much you like that
science-y stuff, so I decid--

183
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,242
You gave away my room?

184
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,241
Come on, Lisa,
try and see this

185
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,873
from the Omnitouch
Corporation's point of view.

186
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,161
Your father's right, Lisa.

187
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,664
Cellular service is about

188
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,075
communication and unity.

189
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,374
Community.

190
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,541
Hmm.

191
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,384
Oh...

192
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,144
I can't believe
you did this, Dad.

193
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,601
Why didn't you put
that thing in your room?

194
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,732
Hmm, that thought
never occurred to me.

195
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,639
Funny how your mind works
in a crisis.

196
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,148
It's just until we pay off

197
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,479
Daddy's desecration
of a priceless artifact.

198
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,315
{\an8}I thought I'd never
have to say that again.

199
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:08,241
Uh. But where am I
supposed to live?

200
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,531
Lisa... what's
your favorite movie?

201
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,986
{\an8}Until you taped over it,
<i>The Little Mermaid.</i>

202
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,446
That's right, <i>The Odd Couple.</i>

203
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,907
So meet your comically

204
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,497
mismatched roommate,
Bart Simpson!

205
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,753
(hums "The Odd Couple" theme)

206
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,629
I'm going to make your life
a living hell.

207
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:28,625
Uh-oh.

208
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,336
(humming continues)

209
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,142
Dad!

210
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,430
Whoa.

211
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,101
Okay, if you're going
to live in my room

212
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,938
you're going to obey
my rules.

213
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,363
One, I am Bart, thy god.

214
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,862
If I am out,
the Krusty doll is thy god.

215
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,235
If the doll's with me,

216
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,361
you will worship
the Night-light.

217
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,697
Should the Night-light

218
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,822
be unable to fulfill
its duties...

219
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,488
-Shut up.
-You shut up.

220
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,826
Oh, this is not going to work.

221
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,002
No, you shut up.

222
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,620
(groaning) Oh...

223
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,786
(electric current crackling)

224
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,338
<i>-PRINCIPAL SKINNER: Hello, Mother?</i>
-(gasping) Maggie?

225
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,965
<i>MRS. SKINNER:</i>
<i>Seymour, you were supposed</i>

226
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,182
<i>to call me three minutes ago.</i>

227
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,013
Sorry, Mother, I was driving
through a tunnel

228
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,428
and my cell phone
wouldn't work.

229
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,636
I don't want you driving
through tunnels.

230
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,136
You know what that symbolizes.

231
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,938
<i>But, Mother, it cuts 90 minutes</i>
<i>off my drive.</i>

232
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,482
<i>MRS. SKINNER: No tunnels!</i>

233
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,106
Homer, we're picking up
cell phone calls

234
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,362
over the baby monitor.

235
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,073
Whoo! Anything spicy?

236
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,663
Oh, that's not the point.

237
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,158
We should report this
to an Omnitouch care rep.

238
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,161
People's privacy is at stake.

239
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,123
Great. I'm going
to eat mayonnaise.

240
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,794
(groans)

241
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,210
(chair squeaking)

242
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,634
Bart, stop it.

243
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,092
-Stop what?
-Squeaking that chair.

244
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,012
Hey, that's what I do
in my room, Lis.

245
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,261
I squeak my chair.

246
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,762
-(squeaking faster)
-Argh!

247
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,644
Oh, quit it, quit it,
quit it, quit it!

248
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,432
Well, well, if it isn't
Frick and Frack,

249
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,976
Jack and Jill, Fred and Ethel,
the three...

250
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,730
Dad, will you please tell Bart
to stop squeaking his chair?

251
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,693
I'm trying
to do my homework.

252
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,783
Bart, stop squeaking
your chair.

253
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,819
If you've got to do
something, click this pen.

254
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:13,953
(clicking)

255
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,360
No!

256
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,488
-Hey, that looks like fun.
-Race you.

257
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,535
You're on.
Lisa, you play winner.

258
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,119
(rapid clicking)

259
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,793
Come on, come on!

260
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,332
-I'm gaining on ya!
-(both laughing)

261
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,879
Oh, honey, you missed
a great race.

262
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Bart was winning,
but then he said,

263
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,045
"this is stupid,"

264
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,459
and he stopped and I won.

265
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,837
Dad, I am trying
to do my homework.

266
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,465
Hmm. Hey, you're mad at me.

267
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,143
That wasn't
your mayonnaise, was it?

268
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,141
Dad, why did you have
to take away my room?

269
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,484
Maybe you'd feel better

270
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,309
if we watched
some TV together.

271
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,614
(groans) I just want to study.

272
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,108
-That's no fun.
-It is to me.

273
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,111
-No, it's not.
-Dad!

274
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,404
Oh, here's something
you'll like--

275
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,568
"When animals attack
magicians."

276
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,237
<i>MAN: Pick a card, any...</i>

277
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,285
-(baboon screeches)
-(man screams)

278
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,829
-(chuckling)
-That's awful.

279
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,713
-Awful entertaining.
-(stomach gurgling)

280
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,750
Oh, my stomach hurts.

281
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,384
<i>Hey, it's Krusty.</i>

282
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,551
<i>I need you to get me</i>
<i>out of another jam.</i>

283
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,050
I picked up this chick
last night.

284
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,972
At least I thought
she was a chick.

285
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,681
(laughing)

286
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,811
Showbiz is so fascinating.

287
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,769
Uh, Mom,
I don't feel so good.

288
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,101
(groans)

289
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,306
What is it, honey?

290
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,686
My tummy really hurts.

291
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:34,783
Somebody wants mommy
to change baby's diaper.

292
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,030
Is that somebody you, Homer?

293
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,823
Yes, it is.

294
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,486
Okay, then you can take Lisa
to Dr. Hibbert's.

295
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,655
Great. Maybe on the way back,

296
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,584
we can swing
by the Demolition Derby

297
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,213
and have a nice talk.

298
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,209
Oh, sounds great.

299
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,961
-(gurgling)
-Lisa, I'm afraid

300
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,553
your tummy ache
may be caused by stress.

301
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,209
Well, that's a relief.

302
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,007
(chuckles) Yes. Anyway,
when it comes to stress,

303
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,392
I believe laughter
is the best medicine.

304
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,469
You know, before I learned
to chuckle mindlessly,

305
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,515
I was headed
for an early grave myself.

306
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,978
(chuckling)

307
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,099
Give it a try, honey.

308
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:11,055
(half-hearted chuckling)

309
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,147
Oh, now,
you call that chuckling?

310
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,612
Come on, child, force it.

311
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,612
I'm really not
the chuckling type.

312
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,414
It's true. I'm always making
clever noises

313
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,448
and she never chuckles at 'em.

314
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,332
Well, I could prescribe
some harsh antacids,

315
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,500
but I think Lisa
would benefit more

316
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,329
from some herbal teas
or aromatherapy.

317
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,705
Yeah, you know,
some of that all-natural stuff

318
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:32,712
is really very...

319
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:33,793
Oh, no, you don't.

320
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,378
Screw that touchy-queery crap.

321
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,924
We'll take the harsh antacids.

322
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,927
Nothing's too good
for my little girl.

323
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,930
I sure settled his hash.

324
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,602
Imagine that quack
thinking you'd try

325
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,850
one of those crazy
new-age cures.

326
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,772
They're not all crazy, Dad.

327
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,101
Sure they are, honey.

328
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,557
You know, just because
you say something is crazy

329
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,567
doesn't make it so,
and just because you think

330
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,649
museums are boring
and demolition derbies are fun

331
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,275
doesn't make that true, either!

332
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,815
I'm sorry, Lisa.

333
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,157
Oh, it's not your fault.

334
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,992
I know we love each other, Dad,

335
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,867
but we're two
very different people,

336
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,634
and, much as I hate to say it,
as time goes on,

337
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,498
we'll probably just drift
further and further apart.

338
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,756
HOMER: Oh, Lisa, honey,
I won't ever let that happen.

339
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,049
Oh.

340
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,892
Dad, you don't have to go
to a new-age store just for me.

341
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,972
I know you think
this stuff is stupid.

342
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,768
Nah, you must be
thinking of your mother.

343
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,401
I'm always exploring
alternatives

344
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,519
and expanding my horizons
into realms of...

345
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:38,818
Can't we just go in?

346
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:39,941
(bell ringing)

347
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,490
Oh, good...
I've been meaning to buy a...

348
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,872
{\an8}"dream-catcher"?
Give me a break.

349
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,740
{\an8}I just wish
you could keep an open mind

350
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,077
{\an8}about other cultures.

351
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,501
Other cultures are fine.

352
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,869
I'm just saying
I can get along in life

353
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,206
without a... "toothbrush."

354
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,501
<i>Namaste.</i>

355
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,844
And, uh, ooga-booga to you, too.

356
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,090
May I tell you
about our white-light specials?

357
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,972
Absolutely not.
My little girl's tummy hurts.

358
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,800
Do you have anything
to stop her complaining?

359
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,175
Dad!

360
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,392
Here...

361
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,971
try this wheat grass juice.

362
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,725
(slurping) Blah!

363
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,439
Well, your tongue works.

364
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,809
Mm-hmm. Hmm...

365
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,435
Let's try some oil of Lorenzo,

366
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,572
and, uh, what's keeping
Joan Rivers alive?

367
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,069
Fetal grindings,

368
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,820
but I have a better idea.

369
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,655
Oh, no, no freezing.

370
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,198
No, Mr. Simpson,

371
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,872
this is
a sensory-deprivation tank.

372
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,501
It blocks out
all the external distractions

373
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,709
-that bombard our souls.
-Can you pee in it?

374
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,619
-I'll take two hours.
-Me, too.

375
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,417
You're about to take
a journey into the mind.

376
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,303
You may see
and experience things

377
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,050
that are strange
and frightening,

378
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,842
but remember,
they can't physically harm you,

379
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,886
though they may
destroy you mentally.

380
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,010
HOMER: So what?

381
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,732
<i>LISA:</i>
<i>Ah, this is kind of relaxing,</i>

382
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,774

383
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,648

00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,855

00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,493

-Ooh, this sounds juicy.

397
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,222
Hmm...

398
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,887
Hey, Milhouse,
want to have some fun?

399
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:36,886
Uh...

400
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,307
Okay.

401
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,686
{\an8}How am I supposed to
hallucinate with all these swirling colors

402
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,987
{\an8}distracting me?

403
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,071
Hey...

404
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,576
Oh, it's a ball of yarn.

405
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,739
That's funny.

406
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,786
I feel like batting it around.

407
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,790
Wow, I have a paw!

408
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,166
Oh, my gosh.

409
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,422
I've entered the body
of our cat.

410
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,625
(sucking)

411
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,514
Ah! Maggie!

412
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,091
Hey, hey,
get your sticky hands off me.

413
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,097
Ow!

414
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,508
(hisses)

415
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,636
Oh, bad cat. Leave her alone.

416
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,853
(grunts)

417
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,063

00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:22,106
{\an8}Wow, my mind just created
that out of nothing.

419
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:25,479
{\an8}This tank is releasing

425
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,332
Where is everybody?

426
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,504
Does this town
shut down at 5:00?

Ooh, talk to me, baby.

430
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,925
Okay, I think I lost them.

431
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,600
-(mooing)
-Uh-oh, a cow.

432
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,009
Eat lead, bossy.

433
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,727
Listen, Tony,
I need someplace to hide.

434
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,348
Oh, this place looks good--

435
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,686
"742 Evergreen Terrace."

436
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,232
-(gasps)
-Now, to open the door

437
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,776
and kill whoever's inside.

438
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,782
<i>I'll start by turning the knob.</i>

439
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,115

440
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,779
Got you, Mrs...

00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,988
(groans)

442
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,077
Oh, my God.

444
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,831
Oh, Mom, you are
a prankster's dream.

00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,036
(laughs)

446
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,876
Wow, you really
clobbered him.

447
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,711
That was a horrible trick
to play on your mother.

448
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,877
Yeah, well, it serves you right
for eavesdropping.

449
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,676
Hmm.

450
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,100
Well, I guess we both learned
a lesson...

451
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,470
But, if anybody asks,
you hit him.

452
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,347
(groaning)

453
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,814
CLERK: But you can't just
repossess our merchandise.

454
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,475
The I Ching said I had
six months till bankruptcy.

455
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,984
Hey, channel somebody
who gives a damn.

456
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,738
Can't we discuss this
over some sympathy tea?

457
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,240
Sorry, the teas are
already on the truck.

458
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,624
There's only enough room

459
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,370
on the truck for this one.

460
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,332
We'll get the other one later.

461
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,712
(both grunting)

462
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,249
Hey... this piece of junk

463
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,423
is finally doing something.

464
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,752
(laughs)

465
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,296
Oh, man, this is heavy!

466
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,219
You should lift
with your legs.

467
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,128
Yeah, aw, screw it.
I got health insurance. Oh!

468
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,765
Abracadabra.

469
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,901
The crystal says,
"Your baby shall be a girl."

470
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:26,899
Shut up!

471
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,610
(tires squealing)

472
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,820
(crashes)

473
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,490
Whoo!
Sensory deprivation kicks ass!

475
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,739
Oh, Neddy, you almost hit
that coffin.

476
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,959
(gasping) Leapin' Lazarus!

477
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,539
Is this what passes
for eternal rest these days?

478
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,705
Rod, go get Daddy
his burying shovel.

479
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,004
Yay!

480
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,335
You sure buried him deep,
Daddy.

481
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,513
(laughing) Not so deep
the Lord can't find him...

482
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,263
and judge him.

483
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:01,055
This is the best birthday
I ever had.

484
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,191
Okay, I'm ready
to get out now.

485
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,520
Yoo-hoo, hippie lady.

486
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,855
Hippie lady?

487
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,440
Hey, hippie lady!
(yelling)

488
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,816
Oh! What's going on?

489
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,738
(yelling)

490
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,581
Oh! Ow! Oh!

491
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,330
This inner-peace stuff is tough
on the old coconut!

492
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,963
(grunting)

493
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,959
Hippie lady,
I want to get out.

494
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,171
Oh!

495
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,546
(humming)

496
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:35,339
Hmm? Look, Daddy,
a whale egg.

497
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,514
Oh, geez, I am so sick
of companies dumping their crud

498
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,104
in our ocean
without a permit.

499
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,309
It's not like
those permits are hard to get.

500
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,929
You're going right back
where you came from.

501
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,187
But, Daddy,
you're on vacation.

502
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,479
Crime doesn't take a vacation.

503
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,525
Hey, hey, hey, careful!
You'll pop it!

504
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:57,399
Wow, I've been a cat,
a tree, and Cokie Roberts.

505
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,357
(gasps)
It's happening again.

506
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,368
I wonder where
I'm going this time.

507
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,580
What's that? Oh, yuck!

508
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,330
That sandwich is full of meat!

509
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,542
There's... bacon...

510
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,463
Canadian bacon...

511
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,001
Mexican bacon...

512
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,254
(loudly salivating)

513
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,548
LISA: (as Homer)
And a mouthwatering veal chop.

514
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,764
(slurping)

515
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,853
Oh, no. Now I'm Dad.

516
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,180
Oh... and I'm
at a stupid, boring ballet.

517
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,096
(yawning)

518
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,015
(snoring)

519
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,944
Dad! Wake up!

520
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,073
Your snoring is disturbing
the dancers.

521
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,650
Hmm.

522
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,695
How can you embarrass me
like this?

523
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,279
Ooh, you won't sit
through anything

524
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,204
that doesn't have car crashes.

525
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,412
I'm sorry, honey.

526
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,832
Jeez, why's she so mad at me?

527
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,371
I only came to this dump
so I could be with her.

528
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,455
And what happened
to my big sandwich?

529
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,130
(snoring)

530
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,713
(snoring)

531
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,126
(sighs)

532
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,594
(groans)

533
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,394
Boy... I can really be a pain
in the butt.

534
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,888
-(creaking)
-Gee, I should cut Dad some slack.

535
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,102
After all,
he did take me to the ballet

536
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,692
and the Smithsonian Exhibit.

537
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,518
In fact, he takes me
lots of places he hates.

538

Hi, sweetie.

542
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,324
Hi, Dad. How was it?

543
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,368
I went on a wild ride

544
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,331
without ever leaving
the building.

545
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,662
How was yours?

546
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,456
Pretty cool,
but now what do you say

547
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,290
we go do something
we'll both enjoy?

548
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,746
Oh... like what?

549
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,456
(screeching)

550
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,756
(crashing)

551
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,299
Whoa, look at that car burn.

552
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,343
Does it get
any better than this?

553
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,347
Not to me, Dad.

554
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,679
(screeching and crashing)

555
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:48,814
Oh!

556
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,020
(laughter)

557
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,020

Shh.
