1
00:00:08,505 --> 00:00:09,405
D'oh!

2
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:30,859
Hey, look,
the late shift's leaving.

3
00:00:32,462 --> 00:00:34,062
I don't like
those guys.

4
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,532
Yeah, they think they're better
than us just because

5
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:38,000
their performance reviews
reflect that fact.

6
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:40,602
Oh, no. I left a
candy bar in my desk.

7
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,171
That's funny,
'cause I found

8
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:44,940
this candy bar
in <i>my</i> desk.

9
00:00:46,776 --> 00:00:48,877
Time to punch in.

10
00:00:59,443 --> 00:01:01,978
Sir, the shifts are
fighting like Iran and Iraq.

11
00:01:02,046 --> 00:01:04,381
Who?
Persia and Mesopotamia.

12
00:01:04,448 --> 00:01:05,849
Hush!

13
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:07,417
Sign your full legal name
here,

14
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:09,386
and your will
shall be fully executed.

15
00:01:09,453 --> 00:01:12,822
Charles Montgomery
Plantagenet...

16
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,125
Schicklgruber... Burns.

17
00:01:15,193 --> 00:01:17,227
Sir, is that your will?

18
00:01:17,295 --> 00:01:19,930
It is. I know it's hard
to see a young buck like me

19
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,465
and think of a day
when I'm no longer in the pink.

20
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:26,970
We just need one more
set of initials here.

21
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:29,372
Quickly, now. We're almost
through the half hour per day

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,874
where you're
mentally competent.

23
00:01:30,942 --> 00:01:32,909
And...
...demented.

24
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:43,753
Yeah! Yeah!

25
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:49,859
Yank!

26
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:51,361
Yeah! Yeah!

27
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:52,963
A dinosaur!

28
00:02:04,842 --> 00:02:06,977
<i>"I, C. Montgomery Burns,</i>

29
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,379

Your tortoise?!
Yes.

34
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:22,859
It always saddens me

35
00:02:22,927 --> 00:02:25,095
that you and Sheldon
have never gotten along.

36
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:30,967
Sir, how could you leave me
out of your will?

37
00:02:31,035 --> 00:02:33,136
I'm your right-hand man,
your guy Friday!

38
00:02:33,204 --> 00:02:35,872
Smithers, you are the
campiest of my aides du camp,

39
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,907
but I'm afraid my true
admiration is reserved

40
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:39,442
for the self-made man.

41
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,713
No Steve Woz-ni-ak thee.

42
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:45,615
So... you don't respect me?

43
00:02:45,683 --> 00:02:47,317
No, not until you earn it.

44
00:02:47,385 --> 00:02:50,654
Until then, I will never
see you as my equal.

45
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,358
Smithers... wait!

46
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,826
Yes, sir?

47
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:58,261
In case you
didn't hear me,

48
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:00,597
I said I will never
see you as my equal.

49
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:02,265
I heard you very clearly, sir.
Excellent.

50
00:03:07,822 --> 00:03:10,340
Hmm. Here's a place
I can feel wanted.

51
00:03:12,143 --> 00:03:13,810
You, with the
six-pack-- you're in.

52
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:15,245
You, with the
Ben Affleck chin

53
00:03:15,313 --> 00:03:16,846
and the Matt Damon
everything else.

54
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:18,181
Guess what?
You're in!

55
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:20,083
In, in, in.

56
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:22,452
Uh, in your dreams.

57
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,387
Oh, come on.
I've had a rough day.

58
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,156
With the buzz cut
and the bow tie?

59
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:27,691
This is a nightclub,

60
00:03:27,758 --> 00:03:29,259
not a John F. Kennedy
cabinet meeting.

61
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,501
Can I have a
Scotch and water?

62
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:40,070
My Scotch <i>is</i>
a Scotch and water.

63
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:46,843
Business is slow, huh?

64
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:50,213
Yeah. Frankly, I'm surprised
you're not across the street,

65
00:03:50,281 --> 00:03:52,215
where they drink for fun,
instead of here,

66
00:03:52,283 --> 00:03:54,984
where, uh,
horrible addiction compels you.

67
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:56,386
They won't let me in.

68
00:03:56,454 --> 00:03:57,887
No one wants an
executive assistant

69
00:03:57,955 --> 00:03:59,589
who only works out
six hours a day.

70
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:01,458
If only this town
had a men's bar

71
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:04,728
for the average-looking fellow.

72
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:05,995
<i>True admiration.</i>

73
00:04:06,063 --> 00:04:07,297
<i>Self-made man.</i>

74
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:08,932
<i>Kill the other two heads.</i>

75
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,034
<i>True admiration.</i>
<i>Self-made man.</i>

76
00:04:11,102 --> 00:04:12,669
<i>Kill them before they suspect.</i>

77
00:04:12,737 --> 00:04:13,837
<i>Suspect what?</i>

78
00:04:13,904 --> 00:04:15,338
Huh? Huh?

79
00:04:15,406 --> 00:04:17,807
Listen, what if I
helped you turn this bar

80
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,576
into a hangout
for guys like me?

81
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:21,177
Uh-huh.

82
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:23,012
Just so it's clear
what I'm proposing,

83
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,714
the men I'm talking
about are...

84
00:04:24,782 --> 00:04:27,050
...men... dinner parties.

85
00:04:27,118 --> 00:04:28,685
Whoa-ho-ho,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

86
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:29,986
Uh, no offense, uh,

87
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:31,821
but, uh,
I just ain't comfortable

88
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:33,923
hanging around all night
with, uh, you know,

89
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:36,259
whatchamacallit,
uh, swish kabobs.

90
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:37,827
Mm, yeah, right.
That's too bad.

91
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:39,429
Could have been fun.

92
00:04:39,497 --> 00:04:41,264
Could have made
a little money.

93
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:42,832
Yeah, you know,
thank you,

94
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,435
but, uh, I'm very happy with
my clientele as they are.

95
00:04:45,503 --> 00:04:48,438
Hey, Moe,
two more for me and my buddy.

96
00:04:48,506 --> 00:04:50,073
That was my grandmother's
wedding urinal!

97
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:51,591
All right, that's it.

98
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:53,143
We are changing
this place up.

99
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,577
<i>Whoa, check that out!</i>

100
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:55,945
<i>Stuff is getting done!</i>

101
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:57,614
<i>Look at them renovations!</i>

102
00:04:57,681 --> 00:04:59,716
<i>And... finished!</i>

103
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:01,885
After this,
ain't no turning back.

104
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:09,192
B-E! Four points.

105
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,960
I challenge!

106
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:13,963
Sorry, hobbits.

107
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:16,633
It's back to the
shire for you. Slam!

108
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,436
Oh, gentlemen,

109
00:05:19,503 --> 00:05:22,372
there is no need
to head home so soon.

110
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,773
Hmm...

111
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:25,341
Ew! Isn't that the place

112
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,844
where all those rats
committed suicide?

113
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:30,313
Oh, it's totally different now.

114
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:32,715
And it welcomes men
with a few extra pounds

115
00:05:32,783 --> 00:05:35,118
or a little less hair.

116
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:37,287
- Ooh! Ooh! Mmm.
- What a great idea!

117
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,936
What about
super-hairy Wonder Woman?

118
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,925
No problem.

119
00:05:41,992 --> 00:05:44,627
Thank you
for humoring me.

120
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:55,472
So, uh, what would
you gentlemen like?

121
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:57,574
I mean, I know what you'd like,

122
00:05:57,641 --> 00:05:59,242
and, hey, why wouldn't you like it?

123
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,611
Oh, ain't being comfortable
with something weird the best?

124
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:04,214
I'm gonna pour some beers now.

125
00:06:07,651 --> 00:06:09,052
Huh?

126
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,687
Hey, something's
different about Moe's.

127
00:06:10,754 --> 00:06:12,589
There's no
chicks here.

128
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:14,207
There's never
any chicks here.

129
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,727
Somehow, there's more no
chicks here than usual.

130
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:19,229
Something's
changed.

131
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,030
There's a sense of
acceptance in the air.

132
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:23,366
Hey, what's that guy doing
in the men's room?

133
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:26,836
He's washing his hands.

134
00:06:26,904 --> 00:06:29,005
I'm never gonna get that image
out of my head.

135
00:06:29,073 --> 00:06:31,808
Look, I have turned this bar
into every other kind of bar,

136
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:33,443
and it never worked.

137
00:06:33,511 --> 00:06:34,844
Total disaster.

138
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:36,579
A complete bomb.

139
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,181
Utter failure.

140
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:40,116
Uh, dream I painted.

141
00:06:40,184 --> 00:06:41,551
And in this economy,

142
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:43,286
a man needs
to find new customers

143
00:06:43,354 --> 00:06:44,654
while keeping
his old best friends.

144
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:46,122
So, what do you say?

145
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,091
Hey, there's nothing
against it in the bible.

146
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,527
Hmm...

147
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:51,995
Uh-huh.

148
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:53,663
Wait a minute!

149
00:06:53,731 --> 00:06:56,065
Your standard
markup is 400%?

150
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:57,500
Now give me that!

151
00:06:57,568 --> 00:06:59,235
Don't you dare question
the gospel

152
00:06:59,303 --> 00:07:01,404
according to Dr. Swig McJigger.

153
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:03,105
He's drinking
his own brains.

154
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:14,251
Children,
I have an announcement.

155
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:17,473
Today is my last day
as your music teacher.

156
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:22,478
Come on, pretend
he meant something to you.

157
00:07:22,546 --> 00:07:24,747
- Stay! Stay, please!
- Don't go! No!

158
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:26,349
Oh, bless your little hearts.

159
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:27,884
This is a happy thing.

160
00:07:27,952 --> 00:07:30,086
I met my soul mate
at a local tavern.

161
00:07:30,154 --> 00:07:32,322
There he is!

162
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:33,790
Aw.

163
00:07:33,857 --> 00:07:35,325
I'm not the soul mate!

164
00:07:35,392 --> 00:07:36,559
I'm dating one
of your mothers.

165
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:37,961
I-I forget whose.

166
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:39,529
Anyway, I-I'm here

167
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:42,231
to introduce your new
music teacher, Ms. Juniper.

168
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:44,701
Honey, just teach the one

169
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:47,036
with the starfish head,
and you'll be okay.

170
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:48,571
Teach?

171
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,340
You can't teach music.

172
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:52,241
You embrace music.

173
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:53,810
Oh, you inhale music.

174
00:07:53,877 --> 00:07:56,179
You roll around
in a pile of music until...

175
00:07:57,748 --> 00:08:00,717
...the scent of music
is on you forever!

176
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:02,652
Mm, good luck with that.

177
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,253
Tick-tock, Dewey!

178
00:08:04,321 --> 00:08:06,122
Tanglewood beckons!

179
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,290
Coming, Dewey!

180
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:08,992
We're both named Dewey.

181
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:10,626
Drum roll, please!

182
00:08:14,498 --> 00:08:16,299
You know, this is
the first time

183
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:18,101
I've ever been at Moe's

184
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:20,837
without that little voice
in the back of my head saying,

185
00:08:20,904 --> 00:08:23,239
"This is not a safe place
to drink."

186
00:08:23,307 --> 00:08:25,675
Check out <i>my</i>
tolerance, Marge.

187
00:08:25,743 --> 00:08:28,044
I'm going to use
the men's room.

188
00:08:28,112 --> 00:08:30,813
Hey, I didn't know
you were,

189
00:08:30,881 --> 00:08:32,515
uh, you know,
one of those...

190
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,083
I am not Comic Book Guy.

191
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:36,452
I am his cousin, Comic Book Gay.

192
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,287
But you do like comic books.

193
00:08:38,355 --> 00:08:40,456
Certain kinds.

194
00:08:40,524 --> 00:08:43,159
Oh, honey, no one's gonna
believe that wig is real.

195
00:08:43,227 --> 00:08:44,494
What do you mean, wig?

196
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:46,095
And about that voice.

197
00:08:46,163 --> 00:08:47,530
Hmm. What's wrong
with her voice?

198
00:08:47,598 --> 00:08:49,032
Steve, is that you?

199
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:50,867
I'm gonna knock
you inside out.

200
00:08:50,934 --> 00:08:52,568
Doctor already did.

201
00:08:52,636 --> 00:08:54,270
Hey, Moe!
Looking good.

202
00:08:54,338 --> 00:08:56,205
Mm-hmm.

203
00:08:56,273 --> 00:08:57,907
He is cute with a
capital scrumptious.

204
00:08:57,975 --> 00:09:00,043
Uh, Moe,

205
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,344
tomorrow's Gay Day
at Krustyland.

206
00:09:01,412 --> 00:09:02,578
Want to come?

207
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:04,213
Oh. Oh, Grizzly Shawn,

208
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:07,150
that-that's so nice of you
to think of me, but, uh,

209
00:09:07,217 --> 00:09:08,785
the Tony Awards are that night,

210
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:10,953
and I'll be too keyed up
to have fun.

211
00:09:11,021 --> 00:09:12,488
Maybe some other time.

212
00:09:12,556 --> 00:09:16,025
Moe, do these guys think
you're one of them?

213
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:18,227
Why would they think that?

214
00:09:18,295 --> 00:09:24,901
Oh, I love you,
Neil Patrick Hairless.

215
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:33,709
Huh. Yeah, maybe I
should clear the air.

216
00:09:36,146 --> 00:09:38,314
Uh, excuse me, fellas.
Excuse me!

217
00:09:38,382 --> 00:09:39,849
First of all, thank you.

218
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:42,085
This bar was on its last legs.

219
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:44,253
I was gonna have
to move in with Ma,

220
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:45,855
who's dead
and doesn't have a house.

221
00:09:45,923 --> 00:09:47,523
So, would not have been good.

222
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:49,392
Oh, yeah, that's true.
No, no, no. Makes sense.

223
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,261
But now there's, uh... There's
something I got to tell youse.

224
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:54,647
Um...

225
00:09:57,568 --> 00:09:59,102
If you tell them
you're straight,

226
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:00,636
they just might go
somewhere else.

227
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:02,171
All right, all right,
good point,

228
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,973
but, uh, let's hear
from Angel Moe.

229
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,808
I <i>am</i> Angel Moe.

230
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:15,184
So, anyway, uh,
what I wanted to say was, uh...

231
00:10:15,252 --> 00:10:16,719
everybody vogue!

232
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:32,068
Children, if I learned anything

233
00:10:32,136 --> 00:10:34,036
from my years as a groupie

234
00:10:34,104 --> 00:10:37,373
for the Dave Matthews Band,
it was to listen.

235
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:38,841
So now you listen...

236
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:42,345
to the string quartet of birds,
river and wind and...

237
00:10:44,014 --> 00:10:45,781
We haven't met...

238
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:47,450
...but something terrible
has happened.

239
00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:51,354
You misfiled the...
permission slips.

240
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:53,689
You keep the green.
I need the white.

241
00:10:56,093 --> 00:10:59,162
Hey, come back to Earth,
Mr. Permission Man.

242
00:10:59,229 --> 00:11:00,563

You've earned my respect.

Hey, Smithers, I didn't know
you were a geezer-pleaser.

257
00:11:57,854 --> 00:11:59,922
Having a "lemon party"?

258
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,858
Ooh, a good old-fashioned
lemon party.

00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:04,260

Sir, we are way past

00:12:08,398 --> 00:12:11,767
So, Moe, you wanna go
to a <i>Grease</i> sing-along?

263
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:14,070
You can be the Doody

Oh, yeah, oh,
I'm so sorry, uh,

265
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:20,076
but tonight I've got a
long-overdue manscaping.

266
00:12:20,143 --> 00:12:22,078
Yeah, but have fun.

267

Moe, have you
been telling

271
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:33,356
the men here
that you're...

272
00:12:33,423 --> 00:12:34,924
"one of them"?

273
00:12:34,992 --> 00:12:37,727
Hey, it's the bartender's job
to agree with the customer.

274
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:40,563
Now, enough chitchat,
I gotta put up this painting.

275
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:42,431
Mm-hmm.

276
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:44,967
A Tom of Shelbyville?

277
00:12:45,035 --> 00:12:46,702
Just relax there, Waylon.

278
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,237
We got a great
thing goin' on.

279
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:50,640
Now we can afford
real bowls of pretzels

280
00:12:50,707 --> 00:12:53,242
instead of trompe l'oeiling
them on the bar.

281
00:12:54,711 --> 00:12:55,645
Huh?

282
00:12:58,915 --> 00:13:00,182
Ah. Got one.

283
00:13:12,386 --> 00:13:13,720
What am I doing
here, Seymour?

284
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:15,741
The thing I'm planning
hasn't even gone off yet.

285
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:18,110
That wasn't me and
you're my alibi.

286
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,342
Yes, well...

287
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,446
I might have a crush
on the music sub, Ms. Juniper.

288
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,014
Simpson, here's my plan.

289
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,784
Ms. Juniper is divorced,

290
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,886
and her daughter Melody
is in the third grade.

291
00:13:31,953 --> 00:13:33,654
Oh, yeah, her.

292
00:13:33,722 --> 00:13:36,023
Classic
space case.

293
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:39,060
Well, if you took
"space case" on a date

294
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:42,029
and brought me to chaperone
along with her mother...

295
00:13:42,097 --> 00:13:43,564
I see how it is.

296
00:13:43,632 --> 00:13:46,000
You get a booty call
and I get a cootie call.

297
00:13:46,068 --> 00:13:48,035
Well, it's gonna cost ya.

298
00:13:48,103 --> 00:13:50,037
How would you like two weeks
of spring break?

299
00:13:50,105 --> 00:13:53,174
Triple spring break plus
four weeks at Christmas.

300
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:56,844
No, but... no, if, if the state
finds out, they'll shut us down.

301
00:13:56,912 --> 00:13:58,479
Okay, have fun dying alone.

302
00:13:58,547 --> 00:13:59,413
Deal.

303
00:14:02,284 --> 00:14:05,219
I can't believe I'm playing
videogames with Bart Simpson.

304
00:14:05,287 --> 00:14:07,655
I've sketched you so many
times in my dream journal.

305
00:14:09,324 --> 00:14:10,291
Great, baby.

306
00:14:10,358 --> 00:14:11,509
Get me some more tokens.

307
00:14:14,863 --> 00:14:18,766
Oh, Bart rides that board
with a passion

308
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:20,701
of an Arapaho ghost dancer.

309
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:23,337
You know, passion has always
been a passion of mine.

310
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,876
Uh, something else about me

311
00:14:28,944 --> 00:14:31,779
is that I'm thinking of
becoming an excellent cook.

312
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:35,249
♪ Would you love her?
Yes, I would, sir ♪

313
00:14:35,317 --> 00:14:36,817

314
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:39,687
What? Here? Right next
to the Nacho-Cano?

315
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:40,955
I like you, Seymour.

316
00:14:41,022 --> 00:14:42,156
You do?

317
00:14:42,224 --> 00:14:43,757
But why?

318
00:14:43,825 --> 00:14:46,577
I mean, but why?
Shh-shh-shh.

319
00:14:46,661 --> 00:14:48,896
Words are your enemy, my love.

320
00:14:48,964 --> 00:14:50,898
Melody is staying at
her father's tonight,

321
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:53,434
and, well, I can't
dance by myself...

322
00:14:53,502 --> 00:14:54,935
although I do.

323
00:14:57,072 --> 00:14:59,039
Can you believe it?

324
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,208
Oh, this is an outrage.

325
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,643

00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,852
have a drink
and tell Mama Moe all about it.

331
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,687
The city won't
let us march

332
00:15:13,755 --> 00:15:15,990
in the Springfield
Founder's Parade.

333
00:15:16,057 --> 00:15:17,057
Well, who needs them?

334
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,626
We can have our own parade.

335
00:15:18,693 --> 00:15:21,028
We do. We have,
like, 20 of them.

336
00:15:21,096 --> 00:15:23,864
But we're sick of being
second-class citizens.

337
00:15:23,932 --> 00:15:25,432
Things will never change

338
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,635
until one of us
is on the town council.

339
00:15:27,702 --> 00:15:29,303
Moe should run.

340
00:15:29,371 --> 00:15:32,573
He's the heart of this
town's gay community.

341
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:35,075
Will you do it, Moe?

342
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,210
Will you become
Springfield's

343
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:38,179
first openly gay
city councilman?

344
00:15:38,246 --> 00:15:40,414
Heh. Well, I think
if you guys can manage

345
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,750
to go into the voting booth
one at a time,

346
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,785
then I can manage to win.

347
00:15:44,853 --> 00:15:46,587
Hooray for Moe!

348
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:51,692
Moe, can I discuss an inventory
issue with you in the back room?

349
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,963
You can't be these
people's leader

350
00:15:56,031 --> 00:15:58,098
if you're lying to them
about who you are.

351
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,833
You're not gay.

352
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:01,802
Whew. I thought
it was an inventory issue.

353
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,504
That's a big relief.

354
00:16:03,572 --> 00:16:06,440
Now don't worry, I'll
let them down easy.

355
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:08,042
In four years!

356
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,612
Yes! Your queen is back!

357
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:17,719
♪ I'm walking on sunshine ♪

358
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:19,041
♪ Not literally ♪

359
00:16:19,109 --> 00:16:21,644
♪ It means that I'm happy
post-coitally ♪

360
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:23,746
♪ It was on a school night... ♪

361
00:16:23,814 --> 00:16:25,381
Skinner!

362
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:27,750
That song needed
no lyrical improvement.

363
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:29,552
Gary...

364
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:32,188
Gary, you know
what you need?

365
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,823
A little...
honey in your yogurt.

366
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,291
Skinner!

367
00:16:35,358 --> 00:16:37,193
You're a regular Casanova.

368
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,028
Or in English,
"new house."

369
00:16:40,197 --> 00:16:42,598
Come on, come to life!

370
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,567
I swear I'll be nice to you.

371
00:16:44,634 --> 00:16:46,569
Can I do a handstand
against you?

372
00:16:46,636 --> 00:16:47,570
Sure.

373
00:16:49,973 --> 00:16:52,174
Melody, you're
a great girl,

374
00:16:52,242 --> 00:16:55,478
but I see you as
more of a sister,

375
00:16:55,545 --> 00:16:57,446
and I don't like my sister.

376
00:16:57,514 --> 00:17:01,183
You're breaking up with me...
upside down?

377
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:05,754
Raggedy Ann was
so right about you.

378
00:17:05,822 --> 00:17:08,123
Thanks to you, Melody's
mother is so upset,

379
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:09,992
she's moving them out of town.

380
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,027
Good-bye, Seymour.

381
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:15,464
Think of me whenever you see
a tattoo you don't understand.

382
00:17:15,532 --> 00:17:18,834
Calliope, is there anything
I can say to make you stay?

383
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:21,103
No. But you can say
you'll come with us.

384
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:22,604
Leave with you?

385
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:24,406
I'll have to check with Mother.

386
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:26,308
Seymour, I found a ticket stub

387
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:28,043
for a James Bond movie
in your pants.

388
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:30,045
Explain yourself!

389
00:17:30,113 --> 00:17:33,115
Well, it-it, uh... took place
in a country we teach about.

390
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,284
Fibs break baby Jesus's ribs.

391
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:38,987
Look, I don't know
how long this will last.

392
00:17:39,055 --> 00:17:40,322
It could be a day.

393
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,057
It could be the rest
of our lives.

394
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,127
But you'll never know
unless you take this chance.

395
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:47,696
Give yourself permission.

396
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:00,609
Willie, you're principal now.

397
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:01,777
Really?

398
00:18:01,844 --> 00:18:03,378
Who's the new groundskeeper?

399
00:18:03,446 --> 00:18:05,414
Also you, and you
don't get more money.

400
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:07,349
Ach.
Yes.

401
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:20,062
My name is Moe Szyslak,
and I'm here to elect me.

402
00:18:21,664 --> 00:18:22,631
Hello, Moe.

403
00:18:22,698 --> 00:18:23,999
Uh, hey there.

404
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:27,202
Well, it's my business
partner, Mr. Smithers.

405
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,071
Nice of you to drop by

406
00:18:29,138 --> 00:18:31,773
and not say nothin' that
costs nobody no election.

407
00:18:31,841 --> 00:18:34,109
But Moe, how can
you be their leader

408
00:18:34,177 --> 00:18:36,244
when you're not
one of them?

409
00:18:36,312 --> 00:18:37,245
Oh!

410
00:18:37,313 --> 00:18:38,280
I am one of them.

411
00:18:38,347 --> 00:18:39,748
I only read <i>Hustler</i>

412
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:41,850
to see the pictures
of Larry Flynt.

413
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:42,851
Sounds great.

414
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:44,019
But first, answer me this:

415
00:18:44,087 --> 00:18:45,720
Do you find me attractive?

416
00:18:45,788 --> 00:18:47,689
Oh, yeah, yeah.

417
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:50,192
Like all gays, I'm
attracted to all men.

418
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:53,628
Most insidious stereotype ever.

419
00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:55,030
You're cute.

420
00:18:55,098 --> 00:18:56,098
You want to go out
later?

421
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:58,366
Whoever said that, yes.

422
00:18:58,434 --> 00:19:00,936
All right, if you're
attracted to me,

423
00:19:01,003 --> 00:19:02,471
then kiss me, Moe.

424
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:07,542
Okay, okay, uh,
prepare to be kissed.

425
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,045
Ha, here we go.

426
00:19:10,113 --> 00:19:12,914
Giving in to my
natural urges.

427
00:19:12,982 --> 00:19:15,917
Okay, a few jumping
jacks just to warm up.

428
00:19:18,354 --> 00:19:20,589
Okay, here comes
the airplane.

429
00:19:26,729 --> 00:19:28,763
I'm sorry, everyone.

430
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:30,298
Oh, this is the most
embarrassing thing

431
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:31,933
I've ever had
to say, but...

432
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:33,034
I ain't gay!

433
00:19:34,203 --> 00:19:36,037
Oh, Moe.

434
00:19:36,105 --> 00:19:38,240
How could you lie
about who you are

435
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:40,509
when who we are
is all we are?

436
00:19:40,576 --> 00:19:42,077
I didn't mean to.

437
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:44,412
At first, I was only gay
for your money.

438
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,616
And, and I had real, deep
feelings for that money.

439
00:19:47,683 --> 00:19:49,885
But then I-I felt accepted
by you

440
00:19:49,952 --> 00:19:52,320
in a way
that I'd never been before.

441
00:19:52,388 --> 00:19:54,589
I just wish
you people could know

442
00:19:54,657 --> 00:19:56,892
what it's like
to want acceptance.

443
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:59,060
Well, so who you
gonna vote for?

444
00:19:59,128 --> 00:20:01,863
Me, or a Republican
whose record is so anti-gay,

445
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:04,399
he's clearly secretly super gay.

446
00:20:05,801 --> 00:20:07,435
Now we don't know
who to vote for,

447
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:09,371
the liar or the denier.

448
00:20:09,438 --> 00:20:11,339
Once again the powers that be

449
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:15,310
have spurned our request
for basic human equality.

450
00:20:15,378 --> 00:20:18,980
Must not the heavens
themselves cry with rage?

451
00:20:22,118 --> 00:20:23,285
How did you do that?

452
00:20:23,352 --> 00:20:25,887
Classical training.

453
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:31,293
I'm very sorry.

454
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,428
I-I had to do what
I thought was right.

455
00:20:33,496 --> 00:20:35,931
Well, as long as I
got nothin' to lose.

456
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:40,001
Not bad.

457
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:42,771
Like Frisbee golf,
I'm glad I tried it once.

458
00:20:47,877 --> 00:20:49,377
What happened?

459
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:51,112
Well, it could
have been a day,

460
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,114
it could have been
the rest of my life.

461
00:20:53,182 --> 00:20:54,249
And?

462
00:20:54,317 --> 00:20:56,818
It was only a day.

463
00:20:56,886 --> 00:20:58,653
You've been gone
for three months.

464
00:20:58,721 --> 00:20:59,955
Groovy.
