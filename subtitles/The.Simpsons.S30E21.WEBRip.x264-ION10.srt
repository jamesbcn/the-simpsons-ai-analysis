1
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,083
D'oh!

2
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:37,298
Will you take us
to Mount Splashmore?

3
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:39,133
Will you take us
to Mount Splashmore?

4
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:40,734
Will you take us
to Mount Splashmore?

5
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,636
Will you take us
to Mount Splashmore?

6
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,639
You're here,
you're just in a long line.

7
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:47,841
- Thank you.
- We appreciate it.

8
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,044
Points.

9
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:55,416
Follow me.

10
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,286
- Where?
- Points.

11
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,688
Points, points,
excuse me, points.

12
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,656
- Coming through, points.
- My visor!

13
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,596
No, Dad. No.
We've been in line for an hour.

14
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,264
You have a point.

15
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:12,200
Points!

16
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:17,471
Will you please explain
where you're taking us,

17
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:19,139
and don't just say points.

18
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:21,542
Okay. Over a lifetime
of credit card debt,

19
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,345
and paying for credit card debt
with worse credit card debt,

20
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:27,147
this family has two million
hotel rewards

21
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:30,651
loyalty... points,
which we can only use

22
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:34,455
at the nearest
Second Best Western Motel.

23
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,325
Oh, Dad,
the points expire at midnight.

24
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:39,793
No worries.

25
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:42,663
If I average 80 miles an hour
for 14 straight hours,

26
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:45,199
- we'll make it.
- I love you, Homer.

27
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:46,700
Step on it, Dad!

28
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,536
And I'll field this call
from Grampa.

29
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,471
Connection failed.

30
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,672
But my liver!

31
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,341
So where exactly are we going?

32
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,142
Niagara Falls.

33
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,977
Paid for by points.

34
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,513
Points! Points! Points!

35
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:03,351
I spy a closed-down Toys R Us.

36
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:10,023
I spy a bankrupt
Sears and Roebuck.

37
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:12,025
- D'oh!
- I don't know about this game.

38
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:13,994
I find it a little...

39
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,365
Circuit City overrun
by wild dogs.

40
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:20,934
Booyah!

41
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:23,437
How can you booyah
this country's decline?

42
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:24,938
Cheer up, honey.

43
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:28,242
We're headed to the one place
that can never decline,

44
00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:33,080
because it was never that great,
Upstate New York.

45
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:43,691
<i>Start watching Fox News</i>

46
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:48,028
<i>Stop watching your weight</i>

47
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:52,032
<i>There is no fancy part of it</i>

48
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,969
<i>Upstate New York</i>

49
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:59,707
<i>They're fond of their booze</i>

50
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,077
<i>Hot wing sauce is great</i>

51
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:07,748
<i>I'm gonna clog

<i>That never wakes</i>

55
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,096

<i>But I can make it there</i>

<i>Upstate New York</i>

66
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,807
Benedict Arnold
fought here, baby.

67
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,713
You want a quarter
for the binoculars?

68
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:13,881
I guess.

69
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,450
Those tourist binoculars
are never that strong.

70
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,991
Now, that's worth a quarter.

71
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,326
So magnificent.

72
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,964
Hey, Lis, want to bounce?

73
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:34,468
Not till I've soaked in
the full majesty of the falls.

74
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:36,604
And done.

75
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,408
Take that, blue boy.

76
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,242
Eat rubber, red head.

77
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,579
I can't believe the kids
are already bored with the view.

78
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:49,082
While the kids
are bouncing around,

79
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:52,019
why don't we do
a little bouncing too?

80
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:57,157
That's even more romantic
than what you said at Fort Dix.

81
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:08,201
Let's see, the angle of rebound
equals the angle of incidence.

82
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,743
Ooh, I forgot to account
for surface irregularities.

83
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,381
Okay, time to take a sick day.

84
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:23,216
Oh, God, oh, God,
oh, God, oh God!

85
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,385
Ooh, a rainbow.

86
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:27,087
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

87
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,996
Where am I?

88
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:40,300
Oh, handsome, horsey.

89
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,035
Am I in heaven?

90
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,605
Even better, eh?
You're in beautiful Canada...

91
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:48,308
is what I'd say if Canadians
weren't too modest to brag.

92
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,643
But we are.

93
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:54,482
I have a young girl who may,
I repeat, may...

94
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:56,383
need medical attention, eh?

95
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,418
I repeat, eh.

96
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,931
Ms. Simpson,
you're a very lucky lady.

97
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,300
Oh, sweetie, thank God,
thank God.

98
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:18,939
Your daughter's fine,
but I recommend a five-day stay.

99
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,642
Of course, of course.
We'll take out a third mortgage.

100
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:26,814
Sir, you're in Canada now,
where your health care is free.

101
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:29,449
Free health care.
Why can't America do that?

102
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:30,984
She's delirious, Doc.

103
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:33,687
America can't pay for health
care and give corporations

104
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:36,356
the tax breaks
they so desperately need.

105
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,858
I'm not delirious.

106
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:40,628
In fact,
I've never felt more protected.

107
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,329
Not like back home.

108
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:45,533
Ooh, hang on. Did you just say
you don't feel safe

109
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:46,934
in your home country?

110
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,936
Why should she feel safe?

111
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,472
In America, the great El Barto
roams the streets.

112
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:55,142
So, let me get this straight,
you're afraid of America.

113
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,544
Is that right, young lady?

114
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:59,179
Well, there's
voter suppression...

115
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,982
and utter disregard
for the environment...

116
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,818
a president
who's such a son of a...

117
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:07,955
Oh, save that language
for the lower 48.

118
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,525
No, I'm telling you.
Our president really is a god...

119
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,661
- Shush.
- We know.

120
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:20,300
Lisa, as you're clearly a victim
of political persecution

121
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,070
who fears for her life,
I must keep you in Canada

122
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:26,473
where you'll be safe and
assigned your own hockey team.

123
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,342
Please not Ottawa,
please not Ottawa.

124
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,812
Yeah, I'm, I'm so sorry.

125
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,314
You can't keep my daughter.

126
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,984
She's the heart and soul
of this family.

127
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,252
- Hey. What am I?
- You're the spleen.

128
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:41,421
We don't know what it does
and we don't care.

129
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,756
My hands are tied, ma'am.

130
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,925
She's in the asylum
pipeline now.

131
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,927
You can't separate us
from our child.

132
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,562
That's America's thing.

133
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:50,263
Well, then you leave us
no choice.

134
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:53,867
We have to deport you,
Canadian-style.

135
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,636
Great. Come on. Bring it in,
bring it in.

136
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,012
Lisa, are they taking care
of you? Are you eating okay?

137
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,680
Look, I'm fine, eh.

138
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:08,115
We're losing her.

139
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,449
Mom, I'm okay.

140
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,218
They put me
in a nice foster home

141
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,886
with Gord and Francette here.

142
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,387
Enough with the accent.

143
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:15,723
Okay.

144
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:18,391
Lisa, where should we go
for dinner tonight?

145
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,527
Harvey's or Swiss Chalet?

146
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,095
How about Mr. Submarine?

147
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,864
Or Earls?

148
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,132
Don't forget Humpty's.

149
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:29,302
Mmm, restaurant chains
I never heard of.

150
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:34,775
Homer, you take Bart back
to Springfield.

151
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:37,444
I am going for my daughter.

152
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:40,313
Local smarty-pants Lisa Simpson
has been abducted

153
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:43,450
by America's Ned Flanders
to the north, Canada.

154
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,953
Here in Springfield,
reactions to Lisa's loss

155
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:48,756
have been loud and uninformed.

156
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,624
Lisa was the moral center
of this town.

157
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:52,626
Now it's Barney,
who knows nothing.

158
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,129
Except it is the purpose of
government to see that not only

159
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,799
the legitimate interests
of the few are protected,

160
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,501
but that the rights of the many
are conserved.

161
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,172
Shut your gibber-hole.

162
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:08,241
She was the only one in
this band worth a tinker's damn.

163
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,811
Oh, come on.

164
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,279
You know you all stink.

165
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:15,182
We've been working on the same
song for 30 years.

166
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,853
Can you fall in love
with a country?

167
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:23,623
The science textbooks
acknowledge climate change.

168
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,993
Class, let's give
an enthusiastic

169
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,461
but quiet hello
to Lisa Simpson.

170
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,130
Hello.

171
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,666
As an American,
I'd like to apologize

172
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,301
for something
our president said about

173
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,970
your wonderfully progressive
prime minister.

174
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:39,606
Is there any way I can send
a note? Or maybe I could...

175
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,275
Right this way.

176
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,979
- Mr. Trudeau?
- Yes, Lisa?

177
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:51,484
I am really, really sorry about
what our president called you.

178
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:55,188
I don't think about it,
I've moved on.

179
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,357
Weak.
He called me weak.

180
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,026
Absolutely.

181
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,360
Let me ask you.

182
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,796
Does this look weak?

183
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,197
Seriously?

184
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,967
Wow, that is impressive.

185
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,902
Watch your tie.

186
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:11,504
So, listen, if I could just
ask you one question

187
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,041
about the SNC-Lavalin
scandal?

188
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:25,753
Now, Lisa,

189
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:29,089
we'll be doing a class play
based on a great Canadian novel.

190
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:32,059
The Apprenticeship of Duddy
Kravitz by Mordecai Richler?

191
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:33,426
Maybe next year, Oliver.

192
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,828
It's never Duddy.

193
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:37,330
No, we're doing
a child-friendly version

194
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,431
of The Handmaid's Tale.

195
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,768
I'd like to try out
for Offred.

196
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:46,106
Oh, so you're asking directly
for something you want.

197
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:49,442
Well, that's not very Canadian,
but I like it.

198
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:59,119
I've never been happier.

199
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,854
Polite applause, children.

200
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,931
No.

201
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:21,141
Hi, Mrs. Simpson.

202
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:24,144
I have to get my daughter back.
Can I hide in the trunk?

203
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:27,480
Okay, but don't tell anyone
we're going up for beer.

204
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:29,449
We all know.

205
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,662
What's this blue stuff, eh?

206
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,465
Oh, it's called a car tail.

207
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,334
Stupid new American fad.

208
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,002
Oh, we'll get it in six months.

209
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:51,872
Move along.

210
00:12:58,345 --> 00:12:59,847
Good-bye!

211
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,748
Where is she?

212
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,316
Mom.

213
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,286
Oh, sweetie.

214
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:09,422
This is the best hug
we've ever had.

215
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,291
Yes, it's wonderful.

216
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,260
Please don't make me leave.

217
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,695
Your home is with us, not them.

218
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,165
You must have known
I wasn't happy in Springfield.

219
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:20,367
All I did was play the blues.

220
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,035
Are you sure you didn't
play the blues

221
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:23,937
because slow tempos
are easier?

222
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,338
Maybe a little.

223
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,307
But this country is better.

224
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,177
Their Fox News
is just news about foxes.

225
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,445
Listen, you little traitor.
I'm your mother.

226
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,014
And you live where I live.

227
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,849
You're coming home with me.

228
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:40,153
I'm really gonna miss
this place.

229
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:42,022
If it makes you feel any better,

230
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:44,357
Canada exploits
its environment too.

231
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,826
- Wha...?
- This country does it all.

232
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,230
Tar sands, strip-mining,
Mountie-mocking,

233
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:53,700
geese-goosing,
French fry-gravying.

234
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:57,570
Okay, but I'm sure
you treat all peoples equally.

235
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:00,640
- Except the Québécois.
- And the Newfies.

236
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,742
Stupid Newfies.

237
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,144
I'm a Newfie.

238
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,750
I guess that does make me feel
a little better.

239
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,019
Thank you.

240
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:16,689
<i>Where the wind blows cold</i>

241
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:19,059
<i>And there's ice and snow</i>

242
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:22,762
<i>Some days go on forever</i>

243
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,265
<i>But I'm warm and fed</i>

244
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,434
<i>In a Newfoundlander's bed</i>

245
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:31,571
<i>I'll be an islander forever</i>

246
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,607
<i>I'll be an islander</i>

247
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,476
<i>Forever</i>

248
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,351
Sir, we'd appreciate it

249
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,787
if you gave us safe passage
back to America.

250
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,458
Sorry, but as it now says
on the Statue of Liberty,

251
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,426
no re-entry
without hand stamp.

252
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,828
- Where do you get the hand stamp?
- There isn't one.

253
00:15:00,034 --> 00:15:03,303
Our top story tonight,
Estranged Brew.

254
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,072
Marge Simpson and her daughter
have now been

255
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:08,208
banned from the United States,
just like asbestos.

256
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,110
And this just in,
asbestos is back

257
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,945
into America's hospitals
and schools.

258
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:14,114
Let me just say
this asbestos will be

259
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,183
reinstalled
with the greatest of care.

260
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,425
Oh, Homie, I don't know
how we're gonna get back.

261
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,995
How soon can you grow
a mustache?

262
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,329
That won't work.

263
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,164
Your call.

264
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:32,832
At least it looks like

265
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,002
you're getting along okay
without us.

266
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:40,307
You know, since Lisa and I
are stuck here,

267
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,575
maybe you should
move up here with us.

268
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,311
Great idea, great idea.

269
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,079
What the heck? Bring Bart.

270
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:48,348
No way.
I can't move to Canada.

271
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,083
I revere this country.

272
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:53,486
Really? The last vote you cast
was for Quisp.

273
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,155
And I won.

274
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:58,958
Maybe we could find a way
to sneak out. I snuck in.

275
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:00,860
You do what you want,
I'm not leaving.

276
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,098
Okay. You win, Lisa.

277
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,700
Looks like we're gonna
be here together.

278
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,469
But there's one thing
I need you to do.

279
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:12,639
Take one last look
at the country you left behind

280
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:15,508
and focus on anything
good about it.

281
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:18,111
You're right.
America's like a great boyfriend

282
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,647
that maybe got a little fat
and lost a little hair.

283
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,884
What does that have to do
with anything? Just go.

284
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,454
Good-bye, USA.

285
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,556
I feel like we did
the best we could.

286
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,391
And we can still be friends.

287
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:35,062
Okay, now I'm gonna focus on
the good things that you've got.

288
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,304
Abe Lincoln, Dumbo,

289
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,374
Aretha Franklin,
Eleanor Roosevelt,

290
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:50,977
Seabiscuit, the computer
that won on Jeopardy!

291
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,713
What is we miss you, Lisa?

292
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,648
Judy Blume.

293
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,550
Oh, I own all your books.

294
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,986
I know, I read
my royalty reports.

295
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,155
Having awkward new feelings
for your country...

296
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,656
it's normal, Lisa.

297
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,259
And you're one
of my favorite readers.

298
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:07,894
Welcome home, Lisa.

299
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,762
Well, I haven't decided yet.

300
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:12,265
Hello, Lisa.

301
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,768
- Louis Armstrong.
- Yeah. And I'm mighty tired

302
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:18,538
of having to keep appearing
in your fantasies.

303
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,107
Get your ass back over here.

304
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,874
Yes, sir, Satchmo.

305
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,777
America ain't perfect, but it's
my job to make it better.

306
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:26,179
See you soon.

307
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,418
What are you going
over there for?

308
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,421
It's legal now.

309
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,956
What is pass the Dutch?

310
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,363
Psst, Mom.

311
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,132
I want to go home.

312
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,966
Oh, finally.

313
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,702
We're out of this hellhole.

314
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,271
Who made my bed?

315
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,072
Least I could do.

316
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,751
We will get you
across the river.

317
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,987
Nous allons vous faire
traverser la rivière.

318
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,258
God, it wastes so must time
saying everything twice.

319
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:17,297
I feel so relieved to have
finally made up my mind.

320
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:22,802
We must ditch
our excess cargo.

321
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,671
You two.

322
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:27,974
You're abandoning us
in the middle of a frozen river?

323
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:31,244
Wow, Canadians
really can be jerks.

324
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,246
Yes, for every Martin Short,

325
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,348
there is no shortage
of Shatners.

326
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,621
Hope you wash up
on a shore you like!

327
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,130
- Homie!
- Dad!

328
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,367
Guess who's here
to save the day.

329
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:59,339
Why did you get a truck
so big?

330
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,441
It's the smallest one
Detroit makes.

331
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:06,145
How will we get in?

332
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,482
I know one place where
there's always plenty of room.

333
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:19,326
I missed you, Krusty Burger
where there's only

334
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,860
one thing I can eat.

335
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,463
I missed you,
pony I had for a week.

336
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:27,033
I missed you,
snarky comic book seller.

337
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,468
Thanks for nothing.

338
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:32,405
I missed you, nuclear ash
that looks like snow.

339
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:35,642
I missed you,
mixed martial arts megachurch.

340
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,310
I missed you, Ralph.

341
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:38,645
You were gone?

342
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,981
Now can we do Duddy Kravitz?

343
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,883
No, we're gonna watch
an episode

344
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,718
of The Beachcombers.

345
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,728
For my show and tell,

346
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:58,431
I brought something
from my trip to Canada.

347
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:01,601
What did you do this week, sir?

348
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,437
Well, a Japanese tourist
took pictures of me,

349
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:06,939
I fed my horse an apple,
and I found

350
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:10,610
a very interesting man
hiding in Medicine Hat.

351
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:13,280
- Papa.
- Hey, Nelson, good news.

352
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:16,082
You've got a brother
in Fort McMurray.

353
