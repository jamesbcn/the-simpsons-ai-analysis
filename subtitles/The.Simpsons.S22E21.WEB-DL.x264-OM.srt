1
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:05,988
It was this or a Porsche!

2
00:00:38,555 --> 00:00:39,672
D'oh!

3
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,395
I love your low prices,

4
00:00:59,455 --> 00:01:01,472
but why did these weddings
get cancelled?

5
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,224
Returned because of a
fight over the prenup.

6
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:05,109
Aw...

7
00:01:05,177 --> 00:01:07,812
That one there-- bride's dad
made a racist toast.

8
00:01:09,365 --> 00:01:10,848
She wanted a cake
with blue rosettes,

9
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:13,451
he slept with her sister.

10
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,271
Cake, will you do me the honor
of making my stomach

11
00:01:17,339 --> 00:01:19,440
the happiest bag of acid
in the world?

12
00:01:19,525 --> 00:01:20,675
You will?!

13
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:26,614
Time for a shortcut.

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,233
Woo-hoo!

15
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:36,007
Dad, the cake!

16
00:01:42,197 --> 00:01:43,965
Dad, our lives!

17
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:45,683
Fine.

18
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:59,113
Uh-oh, they've got
the right-of-way!

19
00:02:03,268 --> 00:02:04,952
Morning.
Guten Tag.

20
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,082
Who's alone in the vehicle?

21
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:21,586
Maggie's locked in!

22
00:02:21,653 --> 00:02:22,687
With the keys!

23
00:02:22,755 --> 00:02:23,755
Oh!

24
00:02:23,822 --> 00:02:25,073
What's wrong?

25
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,774
Uh, first the good news.

26
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:29,360
Two of your kids are not
locked in the car.

27
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:30,678
Maggie!

28
00:02:36,702 --> 00:02:38,486
We've got to get
her out of there!

29
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,522
Babies aren't supposed to sleep
on their stomach on a cake.

30
00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:45,410
Okay, okay, the spare key
is somewhere in here.

31
00:02:47,663 --> 00:02:51,082
What's this key
with the plastic skull for?

32
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,785
That's the key to my box
with the real skull.

33
00:02:55,954 --> 00:02:57,772
Maggie!

34
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,647
So how come we have
all these other keys?

35
00:03:06,715 --> 00:03:10,334
Well, if you live long enough,
you start to accumulate things.

36
00:03:10,402 --> 00:03:12,537
This is from a gas
station men's room.

37
00:03:12,604 --> 00:03:15,973
They put the block of wood on it
so you don't walk away with it.

38
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:18,559
These are from a
key party we went to

39
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:20,862
before we realized
what a key party was.

40
00:03:20,929 --> 00:03:23,564
We got out of there
just in time.

41
00:03:26,235 --> 00:03:27,435
Aw, come on.

42
00:03:27,503 --> 00:03:29,237
You'll miss all the sex.

43
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:31,806
Uh, this key opens
your parrot cage.

44
00:03:31,874 --> 00:03:33,207
Rules are rules.

45
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,278
And these keys
are from all my jobs.

46
00:03:37,346 --> 00:03:38,529
At some point,

47
00:03:38,597 --> 00:03:40,465
we should try
to return these keys

48
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:41,599
to their
rightful owners.

49
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:42,867
Are you nuts?

50
00:03:42,935 --> 00:03:44,034
Let's have some fun!

51
00:03:44,086 --> 00:03:45,369
Homer, stop him!

52
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,338
Stop who, Marge?
Be specific.

53
00:03:48,507 --> 00:03:50,591
Time to get my mischief on.

54
00:03:51,877 --> 00:03:54,211
Let's start with
a little federal crime.

55
00:03:56,431 --> 00:03:58,282
Oh, thank God!

56
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,985
I can get back the angry letter
I wrote to my boss.

57
00:04:01,052 --> 00:04:03,654
I really didn't want that
subscription to <i>The Atlantic.</i>

58
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:08,793
Yes, and this patent
application for a robot dog

59
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:10,611
could use a bit
more tinkering.

60
00:04:10,696 --> 00:04:13,197
With the biting and the
chewing on my tuchus.

61
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:14,682
Oh, the laser eyes!

62
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,284
Why did I give
it to him?

63
00:04:16,368 --> 00:04:17,702
What the...?

64
00:04:17,753 --> 00:04:19,370
I tried to do bad
and I did good.

65
00:04:19,438 --> 00:04:20,922
Haw-haw.

66
00:04:21,006 --> 00:04:22,907
Keys to the
Duff Brewery?

67
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,241
Where'd you
get those?

68
00:04:24,293 --> 00:04:26,844
Well, it might have been
the time when...

69
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:36,204
Duffman doesn't need
Duff to have fun.

70
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:38,105
Seriously, you got any beer?
No.

71
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:40,942
I heard drowning makes you
feel like you're drunk.

72
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:48,165
Or maybe I just
found them on the ground.

73
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:57,325
Wow! The guys at the AA meeting
will never believe this.

74
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:01,078
Oh, my God,
there's the fire brewer.

75
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:05,833
The beech wood ager!

76
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:09,453
The rat filter!

77
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:14,225
The Duff blimp!

78
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:16,527
Oh, how I'd love
to drive that thing!

79
00:05:19,915 --> 00:05:21,098
Really, Duff blimp?

80
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,333
You really want me to?

81
00:05:26,004 --> 00:05:27,138
Oh, what the hell.

82
00:05:27,205 --> 00:05:28,689
Life is made to be lived.

83
00:05:28,774 --> 00:05:30,691
I've been buttoned down
too long!

84
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,794
Hey, Homer,

85
00:05:33,862 --> 00:05:35,496
I really had you
going there, huh?

86
00:05:35,564 --> 00:05:36,898
Homer?

87
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:39,200
When we see each
other again,

88
00:05:39,268 --> 00:05:42,036
you'll be an old man
and I'll be a baby!

89
00:05:42,104 --> 00:05:45,106
And these are from sardine
cans your father opened.

90
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:47,475
He saved them
out of sentimental value.

91
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:49,343
Oh.

92
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:51,545
I'll return this to the school.

93
00:05:51,613 --> 00:05:54,548
Well, Maggie, one
key left for us.

94
00:05:54,616 --> 00:05:57,618
Hmm. This looks like
it's from a windup toy.

95
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:06,928
Hmm, I hope I haven't stumbled
onto my anniversary present.

96
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:21,492
Homer? Oh.

97
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,412
Could you please turn
down those blimp engines

98
00:06:24,496 --> 00:06:26,213
and tell me
where you are?!

99
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:29,700
I'll call you back.

100
00:06:29,768 --> 00:06:31,669
Come back, Pooter Toot!

101
00:06:31,737 --> 00:06:34,438
People might be offended
by your mild tastelessness!

102
00:06:36,174 --> 00:06:37,892
Oh, isn't that a cute
little choo-choo...

103
00:06:39,528 --> 00:06:40,428
Oh.

104
00:06:40,495 --> 00:06:41,829
Daddy, did you make

105
00:06:41,897 --> 00:06:43,030
that devil's music?

106
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:44,332
It wasn't me, boys.

107
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,533
It was the train.

108
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,168
What train, Daddy?

109
00:06:47,235 --> 00:06:48,636
It-It was
right there.

110
00:06:48,704 --> 00:06:51,272
With the... and the...
you know, the...

111
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,342
Jesus cries blood
every time you lie.

112
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:55,843
Oh.

113
00:06:58,163 --> 00:06:59,330
Hey, Lisa.

114
00:06:59,397 --> 00:07:00,965
What you doing?

115
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:03,084
Returning this lost key
to Principal Skinner.

116
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:05,202
But that key could open
any door in the school.

117
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,470
Aren't you curious?

118
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:08,072
Well, maybe a little.

119
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,774
But I'd never break the rules.

120
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:11,375
Little Miss Play-It-Safe.

121
00:07:11,443 --> 00:07:12,943
Have a nice day.

122
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:16,147
Just like yesterday
and the day before that

123
00:07:16,214 --> 00:07:20,484
and the day before that
and the day before that

124
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:24,488
and the day before that and
the day before that...

125
00:07:24,556 --> 00:07:26,073
...and the day before that

126
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:28,242
and the day before that...

127
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,244
Nelson, either tell them
what they're having for lunch

128
00:07:30,312 --> 00:07:31,712
or get off the P.A.

129
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,880
Sloppy Joes!

130
00:07:32,948 --> 00:07:34,482
...and the day before that...

131
00:07:34,549 --> 00:07:35,883
Tater tots!

132
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:37,218
...and the day before that...

133
00:07:38,987 --> 00:07:41,438
Ooh, banned books!

134
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,709
Band books!

135
00:07:45,777 --> 00:07:48,813
Could this key open...?

136
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,515
Get thee behind me Namuche!

137
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,734
That's the
Buddhist Satan.

138
00:07:53,802 --> 00:07:55,403
Let's give it a shot.

139
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:02,493
No problem; just some cobwebs.

140
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:16,190
I've discovered a mystery
wrapped in a riddle

141
00:08:16,258 --> 00:08:18,225
in the basement
of a lousy school!

142
00:08:21,873 --> 00:08:24,174
It's like five classrooms
in one.

143
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:26,897
A science room, student lounge,
mathnasium.

144
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,384
An experimental theater
all set for

145
00:08:30,451 --> 00:08:32,719
a production of
Samuel Beckett's <i>Endgame.</i>

146
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,873
A pull-down map of...

147
00:08:36,941 --> 00:08:38,508
nothing?

148
00:08:38,576 --> 00:08:41,244
And this ruler is unmarked,

149
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,214
and the tabs on this pop-up book
have no effect.

150
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:47,517
And this tooth has no dentin!

151
00:08:47,585 --> 00:08:49,186
Everything is fake.

152
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:50,687
What is going on?!

153
00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:55,525
Mother, it is <i>my</i> birthday,
not our anniversary.

154
00:08:55,593 --> 00:08:57,327
Principal Skinner,

155
00:08:57,395 --> 00:08:59,963
do you know anything about
a bizarre hidden classroom

156
00:09:00,014 --> 00:09:01,281
underneath the school?

157
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:02,883
Mother, I have
work to do.

158
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,652
Well, it's work
if they pay you.

159
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,921
They say they're
going to.

160
00:09:07,989 --> 00:09:11,758
Lisa, I know every moldy inch
of this unaccredited school,

161
00:09:11,826 --> 00:09:14,561
but I have never seen
such a thing as you describe.

162
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:15,796
It's real!

163
00:09:15,863 --> 00:09:17,230
I can show you.

164
00:09:17,298 --> 00:09:19,800
Well, I have a very busy
schedule, but...

165
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:21,468
Myra, cancel all
my appointments.

166
00:09:21,536 --> 00:09:23,103
You're just pressing a Mento.

167
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:26,206
Very true.

168
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,958
Okay, let's go.

169
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,316
Hmm. Is it drinking and driving
if you're flying a blimp?

170
00:09:36,384 --> 00:09:38,585
Maybe I can find the answer
by texting.

171
00:09:38,653 --> 00:09:40,036
Yo, Lenny,

172
00:09:40,088 --> 00:09:44,091
do you know anything about

173
00:09:44,158 --> 00:09:47,978
driving a blimp
while intoxica...

174
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,404
What was that?

175
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:02,743
Uh-oh.

176
00:10:05,747 --> 00:10:08,949
This train is mocking
our intestinal distress!

177
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:10,751
I don't think I've ever felt
this irritable.

178
00:10:10,835 --> 00:10:13,303
Excuse me.
Has anyone seen my toy?

179
00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:15,455
You mean your
windup hate crime?

180
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,690
Ooh!

181
00:10:18,392 --> 00:10:22,863
And now, without further
ado, I give you this.

182
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,235
What?!

183
00:10:28,302 --> 00:10:30,137
<i>"One Thousand and One</i>

184
00:10:30,204 --> 00:10:32,439
<i>Vulgar Marching Band</i>
<i>Formations."</i>

185
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:37,260
Truly these band books
deserve to be banned.

186
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:38,962
I swear, there
was a room here.

187
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,465
Lisa, Lisa, go home, relax.

188
00:10:41,532 --> 00:10:43,200
Try to do some kid things.

189
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,851
You know,
with a ball or something.

190
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:47,521
Or decorate your sneakers
with a Magic-brand marker.

191
00:10:47,588 --> 00:10:48,789
Oh.

192
00:10:56,547 --> 00:10:59,816
Maybe this key will be the key

193
00:10:59,884 --> 00:11:01,885
to putting the "key" in anarchy.

194
00:11:03,754 --> 00:11:06,506
Last place anybody would
expect to see a moon: the sky.

195
00:11:10,178 --> 00:11:11,561
Ow!

196
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,464
Why, we never!

197
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,818
Good-bye, cruel world!

198
00:11:18,903 --> 00:11:21,037
I'm alive!

199
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:23,356
And you're my naked
fairy-god-boy.

200
00:11:23,424 --> 00:11:25,725
Aw, geez, I hope no one
heard you say that.

201
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:28,461
And so, to this naked
fairy-god-boy,

202
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:30,697
I present the key to the city.

203
00:11:30,765 --> 00:11:34,434
Now do us a favor and lower
your pants for the picture.

204
00:11:34,502 --> 00:11:35,785
Oh!

205
00:11:35,837 --> 00:11:37,637
Lisa Simpson
may be onto us.

206
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:39,873
I oversee 14 schools,
Seymour,

207
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:42,342
and for some reason, I always
find myself talking to you

208
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,777
about one of
the Simpsons kids!

209
00:11:43,845 --> 00:11:45,378
Now... Oh, my God,
there she is.

210
00:11:45,446 --> 00:11:47,297
Act natural.
Act natural!

211
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:50,100
Oh. Oh, hello, student.

212
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,302
Um, we were just
standing here

213
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,404
discussing how we have
no, uh, secrets.

214
00:11:54,472 --> 00:11:56,139
And nothing to hide.

215
00:11:56,207 --> 00:11:58,341
I'll just take that
key back now.

216
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:00,143
What? No!
Give me that!

217
00:12:01,712 --> 00:12:03,246
Ah!

218
00:12:03,314 --> 00:12:05,949
Backing away from
something, Lisa?

219
00:12:12,323 --> 00:12:14,291
I've got to get back in
that room,

220
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,159
but Skinner took away
the only key.

221
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,029
What would Nancy Drew do?

222
00:12:19,096 --> 00:12:20,530
Oh, don't you worry.

223
00:12:20,598 --> 00:12:22,799
I'll get my friends
The Hardy Boys to help.

224
00:12:24,268 --> 00:12:26,770
Extra!
Read all about it!

225
00:12:26,837 --> 00:12:30,140
Lisa's a liar!
Pants on fire!

226
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:38,515
Pull over before
somebody gets hurt!

227
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:44,254
So long, suckers!

228
00:12:44,322 --> 00:12:46,573
Oh! Oh, the Zoomanity!

229
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,261
Aha!

230
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:55,899
Hi, my name is Lisa Simpson.

231
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:58,201
Ah, yes, the Simpsons:
a notch and a bump,

232
00:12:58,269 --> 00:12:59,469
two notches and a bump.

233
00:12:59,537 --> 00:13:01,137
That's us.

234
00:13:01,205 --> 00:13:03,740
Do you think you could reproduce
the key in this photo?

235
00:13:03,808 --> 00:13:06,076
Yeah, but it's gonna cost ya.

236
00:13:06,143 --> 00:13:07,077
How much?

237
00:13:07,144 --> 00:13:09,579
$1.85. If you want

238
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:11,214
that little plastic ring
around it,

239
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:13,450
now that's gonna cost you
another seven cents.

240
00:13:13,517 --> 00:13:15,585
Keep the change.

241
00:13:15,653 --> 00:13:17,120
Yes, ma'am!

242
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:30,333
How did this bookshelf
get here so fast?

243
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:31,868
I bet it's shoddy.

244
00:13:34,405 --> 00:13:38,008
What do you think
of that, Nancy Drew?

245
00:13:38,075 --> 00:13:40,410
Geez, they're dropping
like flies.

246
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:51,021
"The children
are on bus 23."

247
00:13:57,261 --> 00:13:58,862
I'm so sick of keys.

248
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:01,481
They've brought nothing
but good luck since I got them.

249
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,287
Brandine, I think we finally
gots us something

250
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:10,073
to cut off that umbrilical cord.

251
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,742
Well, then you got
one more mouth to feed.

252
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,861
Y'all want some chocolate milk?

253
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:16,496
Yes, Mama.

254
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,731
You got it, Embry-Joe.

255
00:14:20,368 --> 00:14:21,584
Mmm!

256
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:28,867
That wisenheimer windup toy
could be anywhere.

257
00:14:29,931 --> 00:14:31,564
Hmm?

258
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:37,651
Chief Wiggum,
stop that train!

259
00:14:39,621 --> 00:14:42,490
Things on the ground
are out of my jurisdiction.

260
00:14:42,505 --> 00:14:43,838
Oh, not through my legs.

261
00:14:43,906 --> 00:14:45,673
Oh, that's really rubbin' it in.

262
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:50,862
Ah. Maybe if I use a pen.

263
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,468
Aw, geez, here comes that girl
I always liked in high school.

264
00:14:56,535 --> 00:14:58,203
Clancy, is that you?

265
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,872
Oh, uh, hey, Maryann!

266
00:15:00,956 --> 00:15:04,225
Uh, how are you at getting
pants off the ground?

267
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:07,262
Skinner's involved
in this, deep.

268
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:10,298
Crazy classroom, bus
full of missing kids...

269
00:15:10,366 --> 00:15:12,033
I know who'd
have some answers.

270
00:15:12,101 --> 00:15:15,069
Someone who's been here
a long, long time.

271
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,608
Yeah, I've been held back
more times than I can count.

272
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:23,278
Which I guess is why
I keep getting held back.

273
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:24,612
You know anything about

274
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,714
Bus 23?

275
00:15:26,782 --> 00:15:28,650
Whoa, Goldilocks!

276
00:15:28,717 --> 00:15:31,786
You best be leaving
those bowls of porridge alone.

277
00:15:31,854 --> 00:15:34,122
There's only one bed
that's just right for me,

278
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,657
the bed with
the truth in it.

279
00:15:35,724 --> 00:15:37,892
Which is probably
the third one.

280
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,361
All right, I'll tell you.

281
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:44,265
I'll tell you about Bus 23.

282
00:15:45,918 --> 00:15:49,721
<i>It was a cold winter--</i>
<i>two-vest cold.</i>

283
00:15:49,788 --> 00:15:52,524
<i>A bus was loaded with kids</i>
<i>for a field trip.</i>

284
00:15:52,591 --> 00:15:55,293
<i>I was gonna shake 'em down</i>
<i>for field trip money,</i>

285
00:15:55,361 --> 00:15:58,763
<i>but what I heard shook me worse</i>
<i>than my dad when I was a baby.</i>

286
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:00,698
Sir, this bus
is too heavy

287
00:16:00,766 --> 00:16:02,133
to cross
the ice bridge.

288
00:16:02,201 --> 00:16:04,135
They'll have to take
a more circuitous route.

289
00:16:04,203 --> 00:16:05,503
There's no time
to be safe!

290
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:07,172
Now bang the side
of that bus!

291
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:08,439
Bang it twice!

292
00:16:10,726 --> 00:16:13,328
<i>That bus never came back.</i>

293
00:16:13,395 --> 00:16:15,330
So the answer
to our mystery lies on

294
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:17,232
the other side of
that ice bridge.

295
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:18,666
But it's summertime.

296
00:16:18,734 --> 00:16:21,002
The ice bridge will be
a water nothing.

297
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,904
Hey, kids!
If I tossed you guys

298
00:16:22,972 --> 00:16:24,839
a bucket full
of something,

299
00:16:24,907 --> 00:16:28,042
could you pour it out and
toss the bucket back up?

300
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,260
Don't drink it!

301
00:16:30,963 --> 00:16:32,380
That's where the ice bridge
would be.

302
00:16:32,431 --> 00:16:33,648
Go down!

303
00:16:37,136 --> 00:16:38,519
Dad, stop!

304
00:16:38,587 --> 00:16:40,605
But, oh, there's
so many buttons!

305
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,731
Ooh!

306
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:06,208
Bart, take the controls!

307
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,459
What video game
is this like?

308
00:17:07,544 --> 00:17:09,244
Blimp Assassin 3.

309
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:11,163
For Wii or Xbox?
Xbox.

310
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:12,915
Original or 360?

311
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:14,800
Fly the blimp,
you spoiled kid!

312
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,588
I'll save you, honey!

313
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,457
Boy, stomp on my head!

314
00:17:21,524 --> 00:17:23,492
Yes! And I've got
gum on my shoe!

315
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,115
You're a real jerk...!

316
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,645
Why you undead little...!

317
00:17:42,712 --> 00:17:45,547
That's not a real arm,
it's plastic.

318
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:47,549
That doesn't mean you're any
better than him, young lady.

319
00:17:47,617 --> 00:17:48,984
He could be a war hero.

320
00:17:49,052 --> 00:17:50,619
No, I mean they're mannequins.

321
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:01,764
Oh, there's nothing I can do
to save my sister,

322
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,849
the blimp or this airship.

323
00:18:31,061 --> 00:18:33,495
It's all pooted out.

324
00:18:33,563 --> 00:18:36,281
Oh, I'm sorry, Homie.

325
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:37,683
It's worse
than you think.

326
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:41,186
I have to buy you
a new anniversary present!

327
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:46,291
Skinner and Chalmers loaded
that bus with those kids.

328
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,060
But why?

329
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,828
I can tell you why.

330
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:51,663
Otto?

331
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:54,233
Are you the one who left
the message on the blackboard?

332
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,701
Yeah, it was me.

333
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:58,637
I was the bus driver
when those sweet young angels

334
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,272
were swallowed up
by the river.

335
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,475
Now I'm gonna join them!

336
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:06,145
Otto, they're just mannequins!

337
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:09,381
Then... I'm not responsible
for a horrible tragedy.

338
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,683
And I didn't do anything wrong
by fleeing the scene

339
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,486
and not reporting it and killing
that hobo with the big mouth.

340
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,623
I might have imagined
that last part.

341
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,893
Skinner! When I say
"Drive us to Bolivia,"

342
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,729
that is your cue
to start the damn car!

343
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:26,315
I can't find the key!

344
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:28,050
Looking for something?

345
00:19:28,118 --> 00:19:29,418
Yes, my car key.

346
00:19:29,486 --> 00:19:31,186
Does it look like this?

347
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:32,588
Yes, quite a bit.

348
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:35,457
He's got your key,
Seymour.

349
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:37,843
I suppose you'll want to know
why this all happened.

350
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:41,096
Picture what I'm describing
in your minds.

351
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,631
<i>Years ago, we received</i>
<i>a government grant</i>

352
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:43,766
<i>to improve the school.</i>

353
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,434
<i>Unfortunately, I cashed it,</i>

354
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:49,404
<i>and the money was in my pants</i>
<i>when Mother did the laundry.</i>

355
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,160
But these pants were
good for another day.

356
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:56,862
That's not your decision.

357
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,064
I'm the boss of
my own laundry.

358
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,817
Well, you don't have to sleep
next to you!

359
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:04,253
<i>To keep the feds</i>
<i>from coming after us,</i>

360
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:06,121
<i>we built the phony schoolrooms</i>
<i>that you saw.</i>

361
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,008
<i>So all you had to do was fill</i>

362
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,111
<i>the class with mannequins</i>
<i>and take a few pictures.</i>

363
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,829
<i>Yes, except for</i>
<i>one small glitch:</i>

364
00:20:13,897 --> 00:20:16,198
<i>we could only afford</i>
<i>to rent the mannequins.</i>

365
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:20,068
<i>If we didn't get them back</i>
<i>by 5:00,</i>

366
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,187
<i>we'd be charged</i>
<i>for the extra day.</i>

367
00:20:22,272 --> 00:20:24,389
<i>And they didn't prorate.</i>

368
00:20:26,075 --> 00:20:29,611
Otto, maybe it was wrong of us
to let you think

369
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,948
you killed 24 children.
Who can say?

370
00:20:33,016 --> 00:20:35,150
Well, there's two things
you didn't count on:

371
00:20:35,218 --> 00:20:36,819
my dad getting
a giant wedding cake

372
00:20:36,886 --> 00:20:38,720
and my sister
locking herself in the car.

373
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:40,289
We planned for
the wedding cake,

374
00:20:40,356 --> 00:20:41,690
we just didn't see
the baby thing coming.

375
00:20:41,758 --> 00:20:43,158
Well, you
should've.

376
00:20:43,226 --> 00:20:45,260
How could I?
She wasn't even born yet.

377
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,795
People have
babies!

378
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,139
Not to worry.
They're just mannequins.

379
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,057
No, we're not!

380
00:20:59,142 --> 00:21:02,678
<i>Maybe we'll fall real slow</i>
<i>like</i> Inception.

381
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,725
<i>Oop, guess not.</i>

382
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:53,866
Shh!
