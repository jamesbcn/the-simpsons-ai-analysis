1
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:16,332
Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce
our youngest and brightest star.

2
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,840
He was very helpful during
our recent operation in Prague.

3
00:00:19,907 --> 00:00:22,211
Only 11 dead.

4
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:23,848
- Excellent. Huzzah!
- Bravo.

5
00:00:23,915 --> 00:00:25,518
Barely double digits.

6
00:00:25,585 --> 00:00:29,058
He will now be taking over
our most critical assignment.

7
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:32,197
I am on the hunt
for a turned American

8
00:00:32,264 --> 00:00:35,738
now working for Russia
code‐named Grey Fox.

9
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:40,080
In World War II, he served
with the fabled Flying Hellfish,

10
00:00:40,147 --> 00:00:43,888
the only unit that served
in the Pacific, European

11
00:00:43,955 --> 00:00:46,426
and Grauman's Chinese Theatres.

12
00:00:46,492 --> 00:00:49,298
Now Grey Fox lives
in a small American town

13
00:00:49,365 --> 00:00:53,173
containing a nuclear plant,
stealing their secrets.

14
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:56,479
This is a map of all
nuclear plants in America,

15
00:00:56,547 --> 00:00:59,185
and these
are all the nuclear plants

16
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:01,122
with bad security.

17
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:06,734
I will go to each city,

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,136
and in no time at all,

19
00:01:08,203 --> 00:01:11,510
I will have flushed out
Mr. Grey Fox.

20
00:01:11,577 --> 00:01:14,348
Even if it takes me a fortnight.

21
00:01:14,415 --> 00:01:15,785
Oy, what's a fortnight?

22
00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:17,622
Nobody knows.

23
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:20,160
Goodbye, chaps.
I shall find this man

24
00:01:20,227 --> 00:01:23,868
with English speed
and efficiency.

25
00:01:26,874 --> 00:01:28,410
No, sir.

26
00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:30,013
I haven't found him yet.

27
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,919
Yes, I know it's been 50 years.

28
00:01:32,986 --> 00:01:34,723
But I've called you
because the dots

29
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,061
have finally connected,

30
00:01:37,127 --> 00:01:38,931
and I'm off to prove it.

31
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:43,974
If I'm wrong, my entire life
has been a waste.

32
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,680
Except, of course,
for the reading.

33
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:51,690
And now to flush out the fox.

34
00:02:02,144 --> 00:02:04,783
Oh, my God.
That's Louise's room.

35
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,920
Yes, it's terrible.

36
00:02:06,987 --> 00:02:08,591
Did she...?

37
00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:12,231
Her family took her back home
to live with them.

38
00:02:12,297 --> 00:02:14,803
I hate to lose them that way.

39
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,807
I sure am gonna miss Louise.

40
00:02:16,874 --> 00:02:18,577
She had a great smile.

41
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:20,289
- Oh, yeah, I loved her smile.
- Yeah, she sure did.

42
00:02:20,313 --> 00:02:21,517
She had a great room.

43
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,521
- Oh, what a room!
- That was the best.

44
00:02:23,587 --> 00:02:26,527
- It has a window!
- That opens.

45
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:30,233
Her call button actually works!
I want it, I want it, I want it.

46
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,770
- I want it.
- I want it.

47
00:02:31,837 --> 00:02:33,507
- I said... I want it.
- It's mine.

48
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:35,477
She was my friend!
I should get it.

49
00:02:35,545 --> 00:02:37,381
Louise hated your guts.

50
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:39,418
She hated your guts.

51
00:02:39,485 --> 00:02:42,759
Now, now,
she hated all your guts.

52
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:45,130
So she let someone else know
the room was available,

53
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:47,669
and they put down
a huge deposit.

54
00:02:49,506 --> 00:02:52,612
For this
I'm taking lucidity meds?

55
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:55,551
Who am I?

56
00:02:55,618 --> 00:02:57,020
It is an emergency.

57
00:02:57,087 --> 00:02:58,791
You've got to see
how I got cheated

58
00:02:58,858 --> 00:03:01,229
out of the only good room
in the place.

59
00:03:01,295 --> 00:03:03,567
Come on, Dad.
You love your room.

60
00:03:03,634 --> 00:03:06,072
How would you know?
You never come to visit.

61
00:03:06,138 --> 00:03:08,009
You don't know
a single thing about me.

62
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:09,144
Yes, I do.

63
00:03:09,211 --> 00:03:10,548
What's my greatest fear?

64
00:03:10,615 --> 00:03:12,484
Cocktail olives and fascism.

65
00:03:12,552 --> 00:03:14,388
Everyone's afraid of that.

66
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:16,359
Those olives look like eyes.

67
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:18,631
Look at this closet.

68
00:03:18,697 --> 00:03:21,369
It's got
a nice new light fixture,

69
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:25,578
not a naked bulb that leaves
nothing to the imagination.

70
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:27,849
Hello, boys.

71
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:30,955
Sorry to startle you.

72
00:03:31,022 --> 00:03:33,293
Sorry. I'll be okay.

73
00:03:35,898 --> 00:03:37,301
Ah, thanks.

74
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:40,942
How nice of you
to welcome me to my new room.

75
00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:42,712
I'm Terrance.

76
00:03:45,584 --> 00:03:47,087
What are you looking at?

77
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:49,960
It is so good
to finally meet you.

78
00:03:50,026 --> 00:03:51,162
You're real.

79
00:03:51,228 --> 00:03:53,466
You do exist.

80
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:54,769
Would you...! Hey!

81
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:57,909
My face was wrinkled
just the way I like it.

82
00:03:58,677 --> 00:04:00,447
Oh, you stay away from me,
fella.

83
00:04:00,514 --> 00:04:02,384
Unless I need companionship.

84
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,421
But don't hold your breath.

85
00:04:04,488 --> 00:04:06,025
We should talk.

86
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:07,528
Yeah, you seem interesting,

87
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:09,833
but I can't stand old people.

88
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:12,638
Ah, just a minute.
I think I know how to tempt you.

89
00:04:12,705 --> 00:04:14,408
I've studied your family.

90
00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:17,247
I know your habits,
your personal pleasures.

91
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:18,584
Now, what might work here?

92
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,055
Oh, yeah.
Can I buy you a...

93
00:04:21,122 --> 00:04:22,290
- Drink?
- Yes.

94
00:04:22,357 --> 00:04:24,395
- And maybe have pretzels?
- Yes.

95
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:26,332
You know everything.

96
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,702
So, pal, where you from?

97
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:29,739
A little bit of everywhere,
really.

98
00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:31,576
I was born in Bristol.

99
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:33,514
Caught cod off of Cardiff.

100
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,653
Fed pudding
to a terrier in Yorkshire.

101
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,991
And I know who you are.

102
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:40,528
You work at the nuclear plant,

103
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:43,934
are married to Marge
and have three children.

104
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:45,470
No, I only have tw...

105
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:47,307
Wait a minute, you're right.

106
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:48,777
That's amazing.

107
00:04:48,844 --> 00:04:52,417
You're making the hair stand up
on the back of my neck.

108
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,292
This is it.

109
00:04:56,358 --> 00:04:58,463
The moment when I say it all.

110
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,501
There's a lot.
I'm gonna exhaust you.

111
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:03,774
Anyone who's interested
in hearing a life story,

112
00:05:03,841 --> 00:05:05,678
gather round.

113
00:05:05,744 --> 00:05:08,116
I'll buy you a drink
for your troubles.

114
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,986
I'm calling my sponsor.

115
00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:13,527
Get over here.
They're giving out free drinks.

116
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:27,254
Wow, those three hours
just flew by.

117
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,959
I want to hear more
about Terrance.

118
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:31,530
I am a spy.

119
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:33,366
- No!
- Oh, yes.

120
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:35,236
My father was an awful spy.

121
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:37,407
A blundering spy.

122
00:05:37,474 --> 00:05:39,579
Sir, I've figured out
how the Russians

123
00:05:39,646 --> 00:05:41,482
have stayed
one step ahead of us.

124
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,452
Lucky guesses.

125
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,490
You fool.
They've planted a mole

126
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:47,528
at the top
of our secret service.

127
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:49,364
Not possible.
I've asked everyone

128
00:05:49,431 --> 00:05:52,672
if they were a mole,
and they all said no.

129
00:05:57,748 --> 00:06:00,621
I became a spy
to redeem my father's name.

130
00:06:00,688 --> 00:06:02,892
I was top of my class.

131
00:06:04,094 --> 00:06:07,000
A real‐life spy. You must
know your way around women

132
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,604
and disillusionment.

133
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,141
Ah, yes, I certainly do.

134
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,845
Always the same.

135
00:06:12,912 --> 00:06:15,383
She saves your life,
you fall in love,

136
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,153
you hold her in your arms,

137
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,659
then some bugger
shoots her dead.

138
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:22,230
You hunt the killer,
you track him down,

139
00:06:22,297 --> 00:06:24,602
he captures you,
he tortures you,

140
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:26,372
you kill the killer.

141
00:06:26,438 --> 00:06:29,478
And round and round you go,
boys.

142
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:31,850
That's amazing, Moe.

143
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,756
So, did you restore
your father's good name?

144
00:06:34,822 --> 00:06:38,462
No, but I will
when I apprehend my target.

145
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,333
How long you been at it?

146
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,402
50 years.

147
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:45,176
Are you paid by the project
or by the hour?

148
00:06:45,243 --> 00:06:46,846
No amount of money

149
00:06:46,913 --> 00:06:49,484
could wipe away
the shame I feel.

150
00:06:49,552 --> 00:06:52,257
Are you supposed
to be telling us all this?

151
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:55,196
Sure.
Nobody retains a word you say

152
00:06:55,263 --> 00:06:57,735
when you're a man
of a certain age.

153
00:06:57,802 --> 00:07:00,908
50 years
of serving queen and country.

154
00:07:00,974 --> 00:07:03,446
Just the one queen, actually.
She really hangs in there.

155
00:07:03,513 --> 00:07:06,051
But I have nothing
to show for it.

156
00:07:06,118 --> 00:07:07,855
Until now.

157
00:07:07,922 --> 00:07:10,928
But...
I shan't get into that just yet.

158
00:07:10,994 --> 00:07:13,466
- Whatever happened to your father?
- Oh, he was

159
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,002
banished to Tipperary,

160
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:17,016
making his way back
to my mother, who had left him.

161
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,714
Do you by any chance know,
It's a Long Way to Tipperary?

162
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:24,589
<i>Up to mighty London
came an Irishman one day</i>

163
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:28,797
<i>It's a long way
to Tipperary</i>

164
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:31,503
Damn it!
Everybody sings it that way.

165
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:34,040
It was written
to be sung faster.

166
00:07:34,107 --> 00:07:36,345
It's a pop song.

167
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:38,750
<i>It's a long way to go</i>

168
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:41,790
<i>It's a long way to Tipperary</i>

169
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:45,229
<i>To the sweetest girl I know</i>

170
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,141
Oh, Daddy, I'm so sorry.

171
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,545
Aw, he's miserable.

172
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:55,049
- He fits right in.
- Homer.

173
00:07:55,116 --> 00:07:57,353
You were supposed to be home
three hours ago.

174
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,257
Oh, please, don't get up.

175
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:02,096
No, my dear.
Once you start this,

176
00:08:02,163 --> 00:08:04,034
it's best to go ahead with it.

177
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,938
Ah, charmed.

178
00:08:06,873 --> 00:08:09,712
Homer,
this is the nicest man

179
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:11,950
you've ever gotten
sloppy drunk with.

180
00:08:12,016 --> 00:08:13,653
You must be Marge.

181
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,427
When's the last time
you told Marge you loved her?

182
00:08:17,494 --> 00:08:19,231
Let's see.

183
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:21,803
It was...

184
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:26,211
When I figured out
how to stuff a porkchop

185
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:27,681
with another porkchop.

186
00:08:27,748 --> 00:08:29,451
Thank you for asking.

187
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,321
Nice drinking free with you.

188
00:08:31,388 --> 00:08:32,925
Maybe I'll see you again.

189
00:08:32,992 --> 00:08:34,862
Oh, you will.

190
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,801
Once more, boys. With feeling.

191
00:08:37,868 --> 00:08:41,308
<i>It's a long way to Tipperary</i>

192
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,249
Every time you sing a song,
it's $5,000 in damage.

193
00:08:46,653 --> 00:08:48,455
Aw, come on!

194
00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:51,295
What?

195
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:52,831
2:00 in the morning.

196
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:56,338
Don't answer it.
Don't answer it.

197
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:59,712
So, you want to snuggle?

198
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:01,516
I'm not gonna be romantic
with you

199
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,285
while the phone's ringing.

200
00:09:03,352 --> 00:09:04,421
Hello?

201
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:06,291
Oh, hi, Terrance.

202
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:08,495
Yes, it was a pleasure.

203
00:09:08,563 --> 00:09:10,366
Oh, give me that.

204
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:11,869
Y'ello?

205
00:09:11,936 --> 00:09:14,642
If you want to know
the awful truth

206
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:16,411
about your father,

207
00:09:16,478 --> 00:09:18,349
come see me now.

208
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:22,825
All right.

209
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:30,641
I've spent half my life
hunting a Russian agent

210
00:09:30,707 --> 00:09:32,578
known as Grey Fox.

211
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:36,519
But now I believe I've found him
in this very home.

212
00:09:36,586 --> 00:09:38,455
Your father, Abe.

213
00:09:38,523 --> 00:09:41,061
What? My dad is not a spy.

214
00:09:41,128 --> 00:09:43,933
So you say.
Ask yourself a few questions.

215
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,271
What did your father do
for a living?

216
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:47,574
I don't know.

217
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:49,144
Yet he always had money.

218
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,781
More than I expect.

219
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,985
Does he hate this country?

220
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:56,659
Well, he doesn't like
any of our political parties,

221
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:59,732
he says Grand Canyon
sarcastically,

222
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,803
he thinks
The Star‐Spangled Banner

223
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:03,472
is impossible to sing,

224
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,009
he calls Uncle Sam, Uncle Scam,

225
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:07,113
and he doesn't like
people who are different,

226
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,887
so I'd say he's as American
as Apple Watches.

227
00:10:10,954 --> 00:10:14,360
Well, I'm about
to show you otherwise.

228
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,385
Let me ask you this...

229
00:10:26,485 --> 00:10:28,388
Have you ever wondered
how it was

230
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:32,096
that you got a job
at a nuclear plant so easily?

231
00:10:32,163 --> 00:10:34,935
How you retained that job

232
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:38,408
even though you screwed it up
time after time?

233
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:40,279
Answer me that!

234
00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:41,883
This is insane.

235
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:44,822
What if Grampa's not the man
I think he is?

236
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:47,895
What if his name
isn't Grampa at all?

237
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:51,334
Listen, I understand
you need absolute proof.

238
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:55,109
If you really want to learn
the truth about your father,

239
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:59,317
meet me today at Springfield
Harbor at 10:00 till 2:00.

240
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:00,587
Okay. I'm in.

241
00:11:00,654 --> 00:11:02,056
But I have one question.

242
00:11:02,123 --> 00:11:02,791
Anything.

243
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:04,528
Your voice, it's so great.

244
00:11:04,595 --> 00:11:05,664
Can you do Churchill?

245
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:10,372
Never was so much owed
by so many to so few.

246
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:11,474
Amazing!

247
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:15,617
I feel like I'm at a movie
I would fall asleep in.

248
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:22,063
He's not here.
Of course he's not.

249
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:25,169
He's just another crazy coot
from the old folks' home.

250
00:11:25,236 --> 00:11:28,342
Don't get between me
and the pigeons, dearie.

251
00:11:28,408 --> 00:11:29,511
Get away from me, lady.

252
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:30,680
Homer, you fool.

253
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:31,749
It's me.

254
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,185
What? Prove it.

255
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,462
Oh, my God. That's amazing!

256
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:41,468
An Englishman dressing in drag!

257
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,171
Never mind, now.

258
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:45,810
Hide behind that newspaper
and sit down.

259
00:11:45,877 --> 00:11:48,015
Grey Fox is here.

260
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:51,822
Each Wednesday,
at precisely 2:00,

261
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:53,626
Grey Fox comes
to this boardwalk.

262
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:57,567
He finds an excuse to sit
on the very first bench he sees.

263
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:01,435
Hey, why is that woman talkin'
like a bloody Englishman?

264
00:12:02,103 --> 00:12:03,312
I'm not English.

265
00:12:03,378 --> 00:12:04,380
I'm Scottish.

266
00:12:04,447 --> 00:12:05,684
And if you say different,

267
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,155
I'll rouge your fat behind!

268
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:10,894
You sound just like me ma.

269
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:12,831
Well, why don't you mind
your own business,

270
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,735
you red‐haired baboon?

271
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:17,273
Oh, it's like a letter
from home.

272
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,043
God bless ya.

273
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,981
Now, watch closely.

274
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:24,220
The second man
is gonna put down his cane.

275
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:27,861
Now see which cane
your father takes.

276
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:29,865
No, Dad.
Don't switch canes. Don't.

277
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:31,769
Don't. Don't. Didn't.

278
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:33,171
Don't. He did!

279
00:12:33,238 --> 00:12:34,975
Oh, no!

280
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:36,879
It's called a dead drop.

281
00:12:36,946 --> 00:12:39,384
He's receiving instructions
from his handlers,

282
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,553
hidden in the cane.

283
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,726
Oh, that
definitely proves he's a spy.

284
00:12:44,995 --> 00:12:47,333
He took the wrong cane!

285
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,807
Now we're gonna see him
get his payment.

286
00:12:50,874 --> 00:12:52,944
My dad would not spy for money.

287
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:56,284
He would only do it
because he hated his country.

288
00:12:57,386 --> 00:12:59,457
Just look through these.

289
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:03,766
This is the worst thing
I've ever seen!

290
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,505
Okay, third worst thing!

291
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,747
I can't believe it.

292
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:13,151
<i>Got my secret envelope</i>

293
00:13:13,218 --> 00:13:15,590
<i>Will I say what's in it?
Nope!</i>

294
00:13:15,657 --> 00:13:16,826
No, no.

295
00:13:16,892 --> 00:13:17,961
There, there.

296
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:20,767
A reveal takes time
to get used to.

297
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:21,902
I should've known.

298
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,639
He was a lousy dad.

299
00:13:23,706 --> 00:13:25,777
He never took me
on a Ferris wheel.

300
00:13:25,844 --> 00:13:28,649
I'd have been proud
to have a boy like you.

301
00:13:28,716 --> 00:13:30,219
I've only known you a few days,

302
00:13:30,285 --> 00:13:32,490
but I believe
everything you say.

303
00:13:32,557 --> 00:13:34,862
Let me buy you a cotton candy.

304
00:13:34,928 --> 00:13:36,498
Pink one, Daddy!

305
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,705
You can't bring
that cup of wine with you

306
00:13:39,771 --> 00:13:41,441
on the Ferris wheel, sir.

307
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:43,646
It shall be gone
before you finish tightening

308
00:13:43,713 --> 00:13:44,715
the safety arm.

309
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:50,192
Look at all those blurry
little dots down there.

310
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:53,165
Sir, you haven't gotten
on the ride yet.

311
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,339
Balance me with a cannonball
and start her up.

312
00:13:57,406 --> 00:13:59,645
Okay.

313
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:01,749
So my father's a spy.

314
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:02,918
What happens now?

315
00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:04,655
There are two ways this can go.

316
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:06,491
Here's the better one.

317
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,627
Your father trusts you,

318
00:14:07,694 --> 00:14:10,767
so you're the only one
who can bring him in safely.

319
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,571
Then I'll deliver him
to justice.

320
00:14:12,637 --> 00:14:16,712
I promise he'll be treated as
well as he is in the home now.

321
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:20,285
I prefer
he be treated slightly better.

322
00:14:20,352 --> 00:14:21,352
Deal.

323
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,632
Brush your teeth after.

324
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,235
You didn't say with what.

325
00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:34,615
Dad, we have to go.

326
00:14:34,681 --> 00:14:35,817
Go where?

327
00:14:35,883 --> 00:14:37,262
You don't have to lie
to me anymore.

328
00:14:37,286 --> 00:14:38,756
I know who you really are.

329
00:14:38,823 --> 00:14:40,793
That's good. Who am I?

330
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,263
No more games! I'm sorry,

331
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:44,433
but the only thing I can do
is turn you in.

332
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,373
Don't worry.
They promised me you'll be okay.

333
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:49,645
Is this one of your tricks
to get me to see

334
00:14:49,711 --> 00:14:51,949
- the butt doctor again?
- Please!

335
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,086
Terrance will be here
any second.

336
00:14:57,459 --> 00:14:59,163
No! I can't do it!

337
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,735
I'll take you somewhere far away
where they can't find you.

338
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:03,104
But we've got to leave now.

339
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:04,407
Say your goodbyes, quick.

340
00:15:04,473 --> 00:15:06,879
You know,
goodbye is a contraction

341
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:09,350
of the farewell phrase
God be with you,

342
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:12,489
while farewell is a
contraction of fare thee well.

343
00:15:12,557 --> 00:15:14,093
Shut up and let's go!

344
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,963
Sorry, gentlemen.

345
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,504
I'm afraid
there's been a change in plans.

346
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,575
Get in the car.

347
00:15:21,642 --> 00:15:22,911
I call shotgun!

348
00:15:24,213 --> 00:15:28,088
Thank heaven
I lost all feeling years ago,

349
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:29,925
so this won't be difficult.

350
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:31,562
Do you even have a license?

351
00:15:31,628 --> 00:15:34,668
Just a license... to kill.

352
00:15:41,147 --> 00:15:43,284
You idiot!
Someone tells you I'm a spy

353
00:15:43,351 --> 00:15:44,755
and you immediately believe it?

354
00:15:44,821 --> 00:15:47,761
No, I believed it
because I saw you do spy stuff.

355
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:49,263
What spy stuff?

356
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,134
You switched canes in the park.

357
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,939
I'm always takin'
someone else's somethin'.

358
00:15:54,006 --> 00:15:55,342
I have two Jell‐Os every lunch,

359
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:57,413
and I'm not even supposed
to eat Jell‐O.

360
00:15:57,479 --> 00:16:00,118
Well, what about the envelope
from the Russians?

361
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:03,358
Those were
Canadian blood pressure meds.

362
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:06,297
I got high blood pressure

363
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:08,334
from trying to pay
for my American pills.

364
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,773
I know you always think
the worst of me,

365
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,445
but how could you believe this?

366
00:16:13,512 --> 00:16:14,915
Wait a minute.

367
00:16:14,981 --> 00:16:17,687
Even though you suspected
I was a traitor,

368
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:19,724
you wanted to save me.

369
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,360
Of course I did.

370
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:22,564
Which means...

371
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,968
you love me.

372
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,807
Apparently.

373
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:30,613
I love you, Dad.

374
00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:34,888
I love you.

375
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:36,558
I love you.

376
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,631
Oh, and I love you.

377
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,568
And I love you.

378
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:44,774
And I love you more
than you love me.

379
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:46,344
Oh, no.

380
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,318
We're here to see Terrance.

381
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:53,659
My husband went to see him last
night and he never came back.

382
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:54,728
Not here.

383
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:55,997
How 'bout our grandpa?

384
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,165
Also not here.

385
00:16:57,232 --> 00:16:59,470
Do you see anything
that goes on here?

386
00:16:59,538 --> 00:17:02,544
Your father and
grandfather left with Terrance.

387
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,017
Your father‐in‐law was mouthing
the words help me,

388
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,187
but I'm trained to ignore that.

389
00:17:08,254 --> 00:17:11,027
Excuse me,
are you friends with Terrance?

390
00:17:11,093 --> 00:17:13,064
I'm his daughter, Hazel.

391
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:16,437
Your father took my husband
and his father away.

392
00:17:16,505 --> 00:17:19,143
Homer left me this phone message
last night.

393
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:21,314
Marge! I'm...
locked in a trunk!

394
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,051
And not in a good way!

395
00:17:23,117 --> 00:17:24,588
I got to...

396
00:17:24,654 --> 00:17:25,890
What's going on?

397
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:28,161
Have you heard anything
from your dad?

398
00:17:28,227 --> 00:17:30,165
He never remembers to call.

399
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:32,737
Especially when
he's killing people.

400
00:17:32,804 --> 00:17:34,841
Killing people?!

401
00:17:34,908 --> 00:17:36,511
But that's when he was a spy.

402
00:17:36,578 --> 00:17:39,350
Now he's retired
and a bit delusional,

403
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,253
bless his moldy melon.

404
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,460
Good thing
he couldn't get hold of a gun.

405
00:17:44,527 --> 00:17:45,796
In England.

406
00:17:45,863 --> 00:17:48,301
Gun delivery for Crazy Terrance.

407
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:49,704
Didn't give a last name.

408
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:52,242
Just said he was workin'
for a foreign government.

409
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:54,113
What about the waiting period?

410
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,518
Oh, I waited for him
to hand me cash.

411
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:57,585
Period.

412
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:03,866
We're on a gravel road
and we're slowing down.

413
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:05,603
Not a good sign.

414
00:18:10,078 --> 00:18:11,213
This is it, Dad.

415
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,750
I forgive you for everything.

416
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:14,186
You too, son.

417
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:16,223
If he asks me
to dig my own grave,

418
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,729
I'm totally not gonna do
a good job.

419
00:18:18,796 --> 00:18:20,966
Well, this is
a wild goose chase.

420
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,369
There's no one in the car.

421
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,574
Open the trunk.

422
00:18:24,641 --> 00:18:25,976
Well, I'll be.

423
00:18:26,043 --> 00:18:27,847
I solved a case.

424
00:18:27,914 --> 00:18:29,016
How did I do this?

425
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,389
I tracked my father
with my cell phone.

426
00:18:32,456 --> 00:18:33,525
Show‐off.

427
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:35,529
I'll put out
the bulletin, Yanks.

428
00:18:35,596 --> 00:18:36,965
Damn it. I mean...

429
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:37,967
Guys!

430
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,071
Dad, I know that's you.

431
00:18:40,138 --> 00:18:42,810
Move yo' ass, sister.
I'm workin' here.

432
00:18:44,446 --> 00:18:47,854
I heard someone's been
a little naughty.

433
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,389
A bit kidnappy.

434
00:18:49,456 --> 00:18:51,360
Oh, my God, you're right.

435
00:18:51,427 --> 00:18:53,397
I've mucked it up again.

436
00:18:53,464 --> 00:18:55,335
Officers, I hope you never know
what it's like

437
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:58,241
to face a lifetime
of failing at your duty.

438
00:18:58,307 --> 00:19:00,178
Never happen, my friend.

439
00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:01,848
Cuffs. Cuffs.

440
00:19:01,915 --> 00:19:04,153
Oh, who's got the cuffs?!

441
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,627
I'm nothing.

442
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:09,998
I'm a failure.
I'm worse than my father.

443
00:19:10,064 --> 00:19:14,239
I'm just a hopeless bag
of useless...

444
00:19:14,306 --> 00:19:17,547
Can't even kick myself.

445
00:19:17,613 --> 00:19:18,749
Poor fella.

446
00:19:18,816 --> 00:19:21,020
Nothin' to show
for 50 years' work.

447
00:19:21,086 --> 00:19:26,297
But who does except for Tom Jones?
That guy loves not being dead.

448
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:28,167
But I could help this guy.

449
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,973
By being the Grey Box.

450
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,977
Or whatever.

451
00:19:33,044 --> 00:19:35,315
You know what?
You got your man.

452
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:37,687
I did spy for the Russkies.

453
00:19:37,753 --> 00:19:39,824
I am the Grey Fox!

454
00:19:39,891 --> 00:19:41,628
Really?

455
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:45,034
Yep. I always knew
you'd be the one to get me.

456
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,439
Good show, me!

457
00:19:47,506 --> 00:19:50,980
I have to admit, I did doubt
myself a couple of times.

458
00:19:51,046 --> 00:19:53,451
Well, now you can retire
a happy man,

459
00:19:53,518 --> 00:19:57,259
watch Fox News and feel
your brain turn to angry mush.

460
00:19:57,325 --> 00:19:59,463
Congratulations.

461
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,206
Marge, may I give you a hug?

462
00:20:04,273 --> 00:20:06,076
Of course.

463
00:20:07,178 --> 00:20:09,784
No! It's happened again!

464
00:20:09,851 --> 00:20:10,886
No, no, no, she's fine.

465
00:20:10,953 --> 00:20:13,457
I was just shootin' off the top
of a soda can.

466
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:14,928
Yeah.

467
00:20:14,994 --> 00:20:18,502
Homer, why don't you ride back
with Terrance?

468
00:20:18,568 --> 00:20:19,369
Okay.

469
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:21,073
No, no. Up front.

470
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,044
Up front! Like a grown‐up!

471
00:20:25,114 --> 00:20:26,751
<i>It's a long way</i>

472
00:20:26,818 --> 00:20:28,956
<i>To Tipperary</i>

473
00:20:29,022 --> 00:20:30,391
Faster! Come on!

474
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,097
<i>It's a long way to go</i>

475
00:20:33,164 --> 00:20:34,534
<i>Tiddly pom</i>

476
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,740
<i>It's a long way to Tipperary</i>

477
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:40,946
<i>To the sweetest girl I know!</i>

478
00:20:52,737 --> 00:20:54,941
- Dad, come here.
- What is it?

479
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,212
Korova govorit mu.

480
00:20:57,278 --> 00:20:58,782
Koza govorit ba.

481
00:20:58,849 --> 00:20:59,784
It's Russian.

482
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:02,723
What's going on in here, missy?

483
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:06,430
Osel govorit
hee haw, hee haw.

484
00:21:06,497 --> 00:21:08,134
Made in Russia?

485
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,342
Oh, that's why that thing
only cost three bucks on Amazon.
