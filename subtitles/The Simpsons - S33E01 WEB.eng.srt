1
00:00:08,818 --> 00:00:10,454
Mmm. When I die,

2
00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:12,726
we should totally
get this sandwich place

3
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:13,828
for my memorial.

4
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:16,934
So good. Mmm. Can't wait.

5
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:20,440
Oh, all these people
loved Mr. Chase.

6
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:22,946
His students
are taking it so hard.

7
00:00:23,013 --> 00:00:25,585
Yeah, nobody grieves
like theater kids.

8
00:00:30,862 --> 00:00:32,298
This is my show!

9
00:00:32,364 --> 00:00:35,170
Why are they singing
about computers?

10
00:00:35,237 --> 00:00:37,141
- It was a musical about Y2
- K,

11
00:00:37,207 --> 00:00:39,646
which was very scary back then.

12
00:00:39,713 --> 00:00:42,051
Scarier than anything
we have now.

13
00:00:42,117 --> 00:00:44,556
The whole show takes place
on New Year's Eve,

14
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:06,065
Mom, which one are you?

15
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:08,303
I was right over here.

16
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,075
In the wings,
calling all the shots...

17
00:01:11,142 --> 00:01:14,115
as the stage manager.

18
00:01:14,181 --> 00:01:17,956
Mrs. Chase,
I'm so sorry for your loss.

19
00:01:18,023 --> 00:01:19,325
Oh, thank you, dear.

20
00:01:19,392 --> 00:01:21,797
Say, look what I found
when I was cleaning out.

21
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:23,534
Franklin's office.

22
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:25,037
My prompt book.

23
00:01:25,103 --> 00:01:27,074
This binder lists all the cues

24
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:29,478
for the entire production.

25
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:32,686
Oh, Franklin always said you
were the heart of the show...

26
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:36,392
That your stage managing
was so... zealous.

27
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:38,798
I definitely ran a tight ship.

28
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:41,402
But in a fun way
everyone loved, obviously.

29
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:43,440
- Oh, yeah, totally.
- Super fun.

30
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:46,547
Of course, I would have loved
to have been in the show,

31
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:48,450
except I'm not much of a singer.

32
00:01:48,517 --> 00:01:52,525
But in my imagination, I've got
the voice of a Disney princess.

33
00:01:53,393 --> 00:01:55,297
What a special time.

34
00:01:55,363 --> 00:01:58,169
I'd give anything
to feel that magic again.

35
00:02:23,253 --> 00:02:25,056
It's me!

36
00:02:25,123 --> 00:02:27,294
The cast said yes!

37
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:29,900
We're putting on a musical!

38
00:02:58,456 --> 00:03:00,393
Wow, you're the director?

39
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,299
No, more
important... the stage manager.

40
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:05,571
Five minutes, guys!

41
00:03:05,638 --> 00:03:07,542
- Thank you, five.
- Five minutes.

42
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:10,882
I always used to love
saying that, before...

43
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:49,325
Good!

44
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:17,515
Wow, honey,
those dorks are so excited to be

45
00:04:17,582 --> 00:04:18,817
in your show again.

46
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:19,884
And I will do everything

47
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,523
I can to support you...

48
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,092
while I'm at Moe's.

49
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:24,529
Mwah.

50
00:04:24,596 --> 00:04:27,401
Sorry, Marge, but I got to
drop out of the show.

51
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,238
I broke my hip
while singing and dancing

52
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:30,875
about feeling young again.

53
00:04:31,777 --> 00:04:34,181
Say, Dad, what if
you filled in for Lenny

54
00:04:34,248 --> 00:04:35,651
and joined Mom's musical?

55
00:04:35,718 --> 00:04:39,893
Yeah, then you'd be the most
supportive husband ever.

56
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,295
Great idea, kids.

57
00:04:41,362 --> 00:04:42,565
I'm all in, babe!

58
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:45,437
One pair of super tight
dance pants, please!

59
00:04:47,675 --> 00:04:50,514
From this day forward,
we are enemies.

60
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,384
Forever and ever.

61
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:54,254
Forever.

62
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:55,624
Okay,

63
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:59,732
back on stage... it's just like
we're teenagers again.

64
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,037
Now let's start the rehearsal.

65
00:05:02,104 --> 00:05:03,306
Theater!

66
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:05,711
Wait, we can't start
without Sasha Reed.

67
00:05:05,778 --> 00:05:07,356
- She was the star of the show.
- Mm-hmm.

68
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,084
She got into Julliard.

69
00:05:10,253 --> 00:05:11,255
Sasha.

70
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:12,892
You never forget
your first diva.

71
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,163
I'd love to know
what she's been up to.

72
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,067
Well, as your dutiful
stage manager,

73
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:20,875
I did reach out repeatedly,
but never heard back.

74
00:05:20,941 --> 00:05:23,312
I guess we'll never know
what happened

75
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:25,985
after Sasha
left little old Springfield

76
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:27,420
for New York City.

77
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:28,857
Never say never!

78
00:05:28,924 --> 00:05:31,061
Hello, old friends!

79
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:33,099
Ah! It's Sasha!

80
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,673
Let me tell you all about it.

81
00:07:08,222 --> 00:07:11,295
Oh, I can't believe
Sasha came back.

82
00:07:11,362 --> 00:07:13,032
What a career!

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,639
I know a famous person
that knows what's his name,

84
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:18,677
who is she,
and never heard of him!

85
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:21,616
Okay, okay, everybody.

86
00:07:21,683 --> 00:07:24,989
It's so exciting that
Sasha is a massive success,

87
00:07:25,056 --> 00:07:27,628
but we really need
to walk through our blocking.

88
00:07:27,695 --> 00:07:29,231
Let's make it precise, gang!

89
00:07:29,297 --> 00:07:31,201
Blocking, so important.

90
00:07:31,268 --> 00:07:33,072
That's what Hal always told me.

91
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:34,408
Hal Prince.

92
00:07:34,474 --> 00:07:35,844
Boom! Named it!

93
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:38,617
But before we get into
the technical stuff,

94
00:07:38,683 --> 00:07:42,558
we need to reconnect
as an ensemblé.

95
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,029
Let's all go to my lake house
and do trust falls.

96
00:07:45,096 --> 00:07:47,601
But we have to carve out
some time to run lines.

97
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:51,375
Marge Bouvier,
you have not changed a bit.

98
00:07:51,442 --> 00:07:53,647
Okay, Mom, we'll run lines,

99
00:07:53,713 --> 00:07:55,249
but don't wait up for us.

100
00:07:55,316 --> 00:07:56,485
Us? What do you mean?

101
00:07:56,553 --> 00:07:59,124
This bonding session
is for the cast.

102
00:07:59,191 --> 00:08:00,994
You understand, right?

103
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,234
Sure.
Of course.

104
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:06,472
Come on, friends!

105
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,612
I was wrong.
Theater kids are super cool.

106
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:10,981
Thanks for the hookup, honey.

107
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:45,551
Okay, the curtain-raiser
went a smidge long,

108
00:08:45,617 --> 00:08:47,387
so stay on your marks next time.

109
00:08:47,453 --> 00:08:49,357
- Take five!
- Thank you, five.

110
00:08:49,424 --> 00:08:53,265
Anyway, I hope you all remember
the best part of rehearsal...

111
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,835
brownies!

112
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:59,010
Are those Margie's Brownies
with walnuts and M&Ms?

113
00:08:59,812 --> 00:09:01,749
It's true, I do matter.

114
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:04,254
Look what else I'm included in.

115
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:05,891
It's all from our shows.

116
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,395
We were such
a tight-knit group.

117
00:09:08,462 --> 00:09:10,366
Remember the tightness
of the knitting?

118
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:12,938
There's my old guitar pick.

119
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:17,080
Oh, I haven't played guitar
since I lost this!

120
00:09:18,382 --> 00:09:19,619
Still works!

121
00:09:20,887 --> 00:09:23,158
Oh, man, this takes me back...

122
00:09:23,225 --> 00:09:24,327
Remember, guys?

123
00:09:39,024 --> 00:09:41,028
Remind me who Billy was again?

124
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:42,631
You know... Billy.

125
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,747
Right. Uh-huh.
The diner.

126
00:09:57,093 --> 00:09:58,763
Is that why you guys
always smelled

127
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,899
like burnt cinnamon?

128
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:10,352
- That was you guys?
- Yeah.

129
00:10:24,114 --> 00:10:27,120
Okay, I might've missed
some of those specific moments,

130
00:10:27,186 --> 00:10:30,025
but I'm sure I'll remember
all the other ones.

131
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:31,896
What else?

132
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,745
Wait, there was a party
at my house?

133
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:41,281
Where was I?

134
00:10:46,692 --> 00:10:49,932
Guys, that's like,
pretty messed up.

135
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:56,979
You weren't even in the show.

136
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,937
Is that why I couldn't
go away to college?

137
00:11:13,478 --> 00:11:15,015
Wait, I thought Jackie moved.

138
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:27,371
Which one?

139
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:33,720
How'd I miss all of this?

140
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:39,264
Except me.

141
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,496
I was unpopular and never knew!

142
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:14,467
All my best memories are ruined.

143
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:17,473
I wish I had never done
this stupid musical again.

144
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:21,448
As soon as Sasha showed up,
it was like I didn't exist.

145
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:23,251
I never liked that Sasha Reed.

146
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:25,890
Taking pop out of the fridge
without asking...

147
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:27,426
getting us sued...

148
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:30,499
Of course!
It's all Sasha's fault.

149
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:33,773
Someone ought to teach
that Broadway big shot a lesson.

150
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,746
Mom, do you
still have a computer?

151
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:43,960
Last night I made some
very interesting discoveries,

152
00:12:44,027 --> 00:12:47,968
requiring the printing
of a revised playbill.

153
00:14:05,557 --> 00:14:07,226
So you don't know the people

154
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:09,998
you said you knew
but who are they?

155
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:11,869
Marge Bouvier, you're...

156
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:13,171
mean!

157
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:20,219
Well, I'm sure you're all
as angry at Sasha as I am,

158
00:14:20,285 --> 00:14:22,356
but now we can wipe
the slate clean

159
00:14:22,423 --> 00:14:25,763
and really come together
as a theater family.

160
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,134
Without Sasha, there's no show.

161
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,909
You ruined everything,
you... techie!

162
00:14:31,976 --> 00:14:34,013
But, w-w-wait.
She made it all up.

163
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,750
She's a liar!

164
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:37,687
I think this is
the kind of thing

165
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:41,528
that makes people not want
to invite you to stuff.

166
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:50,947
Stupid, ungrateful cast.

167
00:14:51,014 --> 00:14:52,917
Did you sleep at all last night?

168
00:14:52,984 --> 00:14:54,888
"We don't care
that Sasha's a liar."

169
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:56,725
"We still love her
more than you."

170
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:59,263
Mo-om!
Bart replaced my Kashi cereal

171
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,835
with woodchips
from the hamster cage!

172
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,140
So? You didn't notice
till I told you.

173
00:15:05,743 --> 00:15:07,947
- What's wrong with Mom?
- Well, kids, your mother has

174
00:15:08,014 --> 00:15:10,853
severely pissed off
all the theater weirdos...

175
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,156
Of which I am now one...

176
00:15:12,222 --> 00:15:14,628
But she can't see
it's her fault.

177
00:15:14,695 --> 00:15:16,532
So... are you gonna tell her?

178
00:15:16,598 --> 00:15:21,341
Indeed I am, and there's
only one way to do it.

179
00:15:58,014 --> 00:15:59,785
Marge, darling...

180
00:15:59,851 --> 00:16:01,354
Leave me alone!

181
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:03,626
Marge, listen!
I'm being delicate!

182
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:05,462
Oh, are you?

183
00:16:17,887 --> 00:16:19,591
Oh, you're right, Homie.

184
00:16:19,658 --> 00:16:21,027
It's all my fault.

185
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:24,266
I did the one thing
a stage manager must never do:

186
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,372
I put myself before the show.

187
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:29,475
You see, kids?

188
00:16:35,021 --> 00:16:36,825
I have to make things right.

189
00:16:36,892 --> 00:16:38,161
You need to let me see

190
00:16:38,228 --> 00:16:41,234
the cast-only text chain.

191
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,504
Yeah, I don't know.

192
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,975
It's really not cool
for me to share it.

193
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,514
Plus, you wouldn't get
any of the jokes.

194
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,250
You might want
to skip over the stuff

195
00:16:49,316 --> 00:16:50,620
with your name in it.

196
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:51,955
Sasha hasn't left town.

197
00:16:52,022 --> 00:16:53,659
There's still time.

198
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:58,167
Why would Marge do that to me?

199
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:00,138
I was never mean to her.

200
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:01,675
I never even talked to her!

201
00:17:01,742 --> 00:17:04,648
Yeah, we don't care
that you only sell makeup

202
00:17:04,714 --> 00:17:07,185
and that you're a huge liar.

203
00:17:07,252 --> 00:17:09,490
I miss high school.

204
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:12,129
Remember the night
of the cast party?

205
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:15,402
You and me... in the hot tub?

206
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,740
That night really happened?

207
00:17:17,807 --> 00:17:19,143
I thought I imagined it.

208
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:20,713
It was real.

209
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,251
And I've never had better.

210
00:17:24,988 --> 00:17:27,594
Sasha!
Sasha, I'm so sorry.

211
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,496
Once my husband
sang and danced to me

212
00:17:29,564 --> 00:17:32,035
about what I did,
I felt terrible.

213
00:17:32,102 --> 00:17:34,774
I acted like
such a crazy teenager.

214
00:17:34,841 --> 00:17:37,412
All I wanted to do was
recapture my glory days,

215
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:39,884
when I could've
become anything...

216
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:41,387
instead of what I really am,

217
00:17:41,454 --> 00:17:43,892
a floor manager at Sephora.

218
00:17:45,095 --> 00:17:46,263
Sales associate.

219
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,303
I guess we both wanted
to be stars again.

220
00:17:50,105 --> 00:17:51,040
There she is.

221
00:17:51,107 --> 00:17:52,175
Probably called us here

222
00:17:52,242 --> 00:17:54,013
to expose the lies
the rest of us put

223
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,650
in our playbill bios.

224
00:17:55,716 --> 00:17:56,952
What lies?

225
00:17:57,019 --> 00:17:59,123
I am
"thrilled to reprise my role

226
00:17:59,189 --> 00:18:01,628
- as Steve/
- Ensemble."

227
00:18:01,695 --> 00:18:03,766
I was supposed
to manage the stage,

228
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:07,139
but instead I just managed
to screw everything up.

229
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:09,143
But there's still time
to put on the best show

230
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:11,147
of the latter part
of our lives.

231
00:18:11,213 --> 00:18:13,752
What do you say?
Should we give it a try?

232
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:15,155
Oh, why should we?

233
00:18:15,221 --> 00:18:18,394
What has trying
ever gotten anyone?

234
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:35,295
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

235
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:39,637
Barney, nobody needs
to do this show more than you.

236
00:18:43,244 --> 00:18:44,581
Yay!

237
00:18:46,016 --> 00:18:48,054
It's a full house, so...

238
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,966
Marge, when I'm onstage
and it's not my turn to talk,

239
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,505
- can I look at my phone?
- No.

240
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:14,741
It's almost midnight.

241
00:19:14,808 --> 00:19:16,377
What's going to happen?

242
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:22,623
Five, four...

243
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,596
Three, two, one!

244
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,704
So the show just ends?

245
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:30,873
What a cop-out!

246
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,677
At least at the endof Rent
you get to see

247
00:19:32,743 --> 00:19:34,246
Mimi come back to life.

248
00:19:34,313 --> 00:19:36,150
This is just lazy.

249
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:44,366
Marge, thanks for reminding me
how good it feels

250
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,671
to be a big fish
in a small pond.

251
00:19:46,738 --> 00:19:48,842
I guess that's why
you never left.

252
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:50,779
Actually, I think
it was because my parents

253
00:19:50,846 --> 00:19:53,785
couldn't afford college
after a lawsuit from a party

254
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:56,423
you threw at my house
but didn't invite me to.

255
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,296
Such timey times.

256
00:20:03,337 --> 00:20:05,441
Oh, my God, it's really her.

257
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:07,045
It's Marge Bouvier.

258
00:20:07,112 --> 00:20:09,684
Just ask her.

259
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:12,990
Um, would you please
sign my prompt bible?

260
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:15,395
You know me?

261
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:17,767
You're a stage-managing icon!

262
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:22,242
Would you go
to the diner with us?

263
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:24,346
We'd die to hear
some of your stories.

264
00:20:24,413 --> 00:20:26,584
Invited to the diner.

265
00:20:26,651 --> 00:20:28,822
I'm getting cheese fries!

266
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:32,128
Cast party at Marge's house!

267
00:20:32,195 --> 00:20:33,932
All right!

268
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,736
Theater!
