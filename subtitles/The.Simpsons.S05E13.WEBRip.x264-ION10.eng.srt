my roles and really get into it.

-Really?
-Yes.

324
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,282
-You?
-Yes.

325
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,319
I hope this has been
enlightening for you.

326
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,573
-But I must--
-Thank you. Come again.

327
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,656
-But--
-Thank you. Come again.

328
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,701
Well, that was a big bust.

329
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,826
Is he really the head
of the Kwik-E-Mart?

330
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,173
-(angry groan)
-No need to apologize, Apu.

331
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,459
It was as much my fault
as it was yours.

332
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,424
-(growling)
-(gagging)

333
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:54,424
Okay, Apu!
I accept your apology.

334
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,388
(both screaming)

335
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:58,931
TOGETHER:
Dad! Dad!

336
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,432
What'd you bring us?
What'd you bring?

337
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,524
-How did it go?
-Fine! Oh, I mean, not good.

338
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,150
{\an8}I'm sorry, Apu. But remember--
<i>♪ Who needs the Kwik-E-Mart ♪</i>

339
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,520
Do you mind?
I'm not in the mood.

340
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,487
Apu, if it'll make you
feel any better,

341
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,529
I've learned that life is one
crushing defeat after another...

342
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,533
until you just wish
Flanders was dead.

343
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:23,286
Yes, yes. You are right, sir.
I've got to accept my fate.

344
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,750
I have feared it
for long enough now.

345
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,631
I'm going to go down to the Kwik-E-Mart,
and I am going to face my demon!

346
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,750
Oh, that'll work out great!
We're out of Lucky Charms.

347
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:43,059
-(door chimes)
-(delighted gasp)

348
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,600
Ah, my old Squishee machine.

349
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,267
And my scum bucket with flies.

350
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,030
{\an8}And the hot-check list.

351
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:59,951
Hey, hey, you're Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,
aren't ya? I mean, you're the--

352
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,202
God, you're-- you're like the guy!
You're a legend around here.

353
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,075
Can I ask you-- is it true you once
worked 96 hours straight?

354
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,134
Oh, yes.
It was horrible, I tell you.

355
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,839
By the end, I thought I was
a hummingbird of some kind.

356
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,510
Oh, yeah! You know, I studied
your old security tapes.

357
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:19,219
<i>Fee-ee-ee-ee.</i>

358
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,677
<i>Fee-ee-ee-ee.</i>

359
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,353
In a few minutes,

360
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,731
I try to drink nectar
out of Sanjay's head.

361
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:30,098
All right, you! Hand over the cash,
and don't try any funny stuff!

362
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:34,977
Hey, pal. I assure you. If I tried any
funny stuff, you would be in hysterics.

363
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,147
-Hey, you're James Woods!
-Oh, thank you. Yes, yes. Thank you.

364
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,447
Well, Mr. Woods,
your new song is gonna be

365
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,911
-number three with a bullet.
-(gun cocks)

366
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,492
-Uh, I'm not a singer.
-Shut up!

367
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,707
-(frightened gasp)
-No!

368
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,300
{\an8}-Apu!
-Oh!

369
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,049
{\an8}The searing kiss of hot lead.

370
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:02,221
{\an8}How I've missed you.
I mean, I think I'm dying.

371
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,512
{\an8}-Uhh.
-Oy.

372
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,465
(Dr. Hibbert chuckling)

373
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,057
Well, you are
a very lucky man, Apu.

374
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,903
You see, the bullet ricocheted
off another bullet

375
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,280
that was lodged in your chest
from a previous robbery.

376
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,068
Apu, you saved my life.

377
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,532
And as a small token of
my appreciation,

378
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:25,033
I got you your job back
at the Kwik-E-Mart.

379
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,327
Oh! Oh, Mr. Woods, you're--

380
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:31,541
but as for me, I'm off to battle aliens
on a faraway planet.

381
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:36,843
-That sounds like a good movie.
-Yes. Yes, a movie. Yes.

382
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:42,224
Hey, let's all hug Apu.

383
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,051
-SIMPSONS: Aww.
-Ooh!

384
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:52,269
Hey, there's still time.
Let's hug him again.

385
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:55,442
-Aww.
-Mm!

386
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,741
{\an8}♪♪

387
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,122
Shh!
