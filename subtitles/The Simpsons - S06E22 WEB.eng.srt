1
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:06,006
The Simpsons.

2
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:25,543
Hey, kids, it's story time.

3
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:30,048
I'm gonna tell you the story
of Krusty's expensive new suit.

4
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,217
His sexual harassment suit!

5
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,011
Oh, boy...

6
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,680
Anyway, as part of
Krusty's plea bargain,

7
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,557
he has a new court-ordered
sidekick,

8
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,684
Ms. No-means-no.

9
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,312
Whoa, you're hot!

10
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,064
Let's get some dinner
after the show.

11
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,567
I have dinner
with all my employees,

12
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,027
right, Sideshow Mel?

13
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,987
We've never spoken
outside of work.

14
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,867
I'm surprised he doesn't try

15
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,831
to blame his problems
on his Percodan addiction.

16
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,080
It wasn't my fault.
It was the Percodan.

17
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,999
If you ask me,
that stuff rots your brain.

18
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,960
And now a word
from our new sponsor.

19
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,964
Percodan?! Aw, crap!

20
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,258
Bart, are you ready
for your history test?

21
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,135
You bet, Mom.
Ask me anything.

22
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,012
Okay. Who was George
Washington Carver?

23
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:21,766
Um... the guy who chopped up
George Washington?

24
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,685
Really? Wow.

25
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,866
Bart, you said you
were going to study.

26
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,993
Oh, my stomach.

27
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,078
You just don't want
to take that test.

28
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,205
No, I mean it.
It really hurts.

29
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,082
Mom, I think he's serious.

30
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,334
Kids are so naive.

31
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,752
Lisa, when you
get to be our age,

32
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,129
you'll learn
a few things.

33
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,756
Like when a sign says,
"Do not feed the bears,"

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,593
man, you'd better not
feed the bears.

35
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,428
Now get to school, boy.

36
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,492
Mrs. Krabappel,
I can't take the test.

37
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,893
I have a stomachache.

38
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,897
Well, that's a lame excuse
for an excuse. Ha!

39
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,815
Look, if you ignore me
and I die,

40
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,400
you'll get in a lot of trouble.

41
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:15,111
Read page six
of the school charter.

42
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,113
"No teacher
shall be held accountable

43
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,199
if Bart Simpson dies."

44
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,368
We're also absolved if Milhouse
gets eaten by the school snake.

45
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,580
Hey, cool,
there's a rabbit in here.

46
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,001
Mrs. Krabappel,
I'm done failing the test.

47
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,295
Can I please go to the nurse?

48
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,714
Gosh, Bart,
maybe you really are in pain.

49
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,841
Well, it would be cruel
not to let you go.

50
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,436
Now you may go.

51
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,398
Lunch lady Doris?

52
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,609
- Why are you here?
- Budget cuts.

53
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,128
They've even got
groundskeeper Willie

54
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,779
teaching French.

55
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,781
Bonjour,

56
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,158
you cheese-eatin'
surrender monkeys.

57
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,661
Look, my stomach really hurts.

58
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,747
All I can give you are these
chewable Prozac for kids.

59
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,748
Your choice...

60
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,874
Manic-depressive mouse

61
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,293
or the bluebird of unhappiness.

62
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,397
Superintendent Chalmers,
I'd like you to meet

63
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,215
our new school nurse,
lunch lady Doris.

64
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,884
Yeah, nice to see you.
Seymour, why is that student

65
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,594
lying unconscious on the floor?

66
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,180
Well, in many cases,
the floor is the bes...

67
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,808
Oh, look, here comes Lumpy,
the school snake.

68
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,060
Help! Help!

69
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,020
Oh, Lord.

70
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,030
Don't worry, son.
You'll be fine.

71
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,033
This boy's appendix is inflamed
and about to burst,

72
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,744
which will make it easier
to find once I get in there.

73
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,749
Man, these are primo seats.

74
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,751
I could really go
for a hot dog.

75
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,878
Homer, this is
an operation.

76
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,962
Hot dogs!

77
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,047
Get your
hot dogs here!

78
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,215
Whoo-hoo!

79
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,051
Okay, Bart,
I will count to three,

80
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,137
and you will be
sound asleep.

81
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,015
One, two, three.

82
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,766
Out like a light.

83
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,310
Scalpel.

84
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,895
Oopsie.

85
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,024
Maybe if I fiddle
with these knobs.

86
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,401
Hey, I smell gas.

87
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,445
Pleasant gas.

88
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,864
Night-night gas.

89
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,161
How's my special little guy?

90
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,997
How you feeling,
big brother?

91
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,790
Oh, this is wonderful.

92
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:33,874
You're alive.

93
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,418
No thanks to you, Homer.

94
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,045
Why, you little...!

95
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,591
Now, Homer, please.

96
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,801
The boy's just had
a very serious operation.

97
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,011
Oh, right.

98
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:48,056
Now, Bart,
I found the culprit...

99
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,808
A jagged metal cereal "O."

100
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,311
Wicked! I got this cool scar

101
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,146
and I get to miss
a week of school.

102
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,108
Dr. Hibbert, can I have
my appendix out?

103
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,152
- Yeah, me, too.
- I want mine out first.

104
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,989
Why not? Follow me, kids.

105
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,116
Nurse, prep these children.

106
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,578
I'm glad
you're okay, Bart.

107
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,091
Bleeding Gums Murphy!

108
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,759
Little Lisa,

109
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,511
it's good to see ya again.

110
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,513
It's been a long time.

111
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,809
My friends call me
Bleeding Gums.

112
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,769
Eww! How'd you get
a name like that?

113
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:38,147
Well, let me put it this way...
You ever been to the dentist?

114
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,357
- Yeah.
- Not me.

115
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,734
I suppose
I should go to one,

116
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,278
but I got enough pain
in my life as it is.

117
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,489
What are you here for?

118
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,491
My brother just had
his appendix out.

119
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,867
Is he gonna be okay?

120
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,078
Hello, I'm Dr. Cheeks.

121
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,455
I'm doing my rounds,
and I'm a little behind.

122
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,624
He'll be fine.

123
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,879
Lisa, I sure am glad
you dropped by.

124
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,631
You're the first visitor
I've had.

125
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,049
What about your family?

126
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,884
I don't really
have a family.

127
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,304
All I had was a little brother
who grew up to become a doctor.

128
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,932
He used to laugh at
the most inappropriate times.

129
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,745
Hey, I've got an older brother
that I'll never see.

130
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,063
He's a jazz musician,
or some such.

131
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,606
Oh, well. Bye-bye.

132
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,317
It must be awful to be
all alone in the world.

133
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,486
Well, I always had my music.

134
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,406
I learned at the feet
of Blind Willie Witherspoon.

135
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,660
I've been playing jazz
for 30 years,

136
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,370
and I just can't make
a go of it.

137
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,414
I want you to have
my saxophone.

138
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,459
This isn't a saxophone.
It's an umbrella.

139
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,711
So I've been playing
an umbrella for 30 years?

140
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,296
Why didn't anybody
tell me?

141
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,466
We all thought it was funny.

142
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,384
That's not funny.

143
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,677
Then I got my big break.

144
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,512
I was on "Steve Allen's
Tonight Show."

145
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,350
Now, a brilliant jazz musician

146
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,353
who's inspired me
to do some improv poetry.

147
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,355
"Twinkle, twinkle, groovy cat,

148
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,648
"how I wonder where you at.

149
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,317
"I really love
the way you cook.

150
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,669
Just like me
when I wrote this book."

151
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,278
"How To Make Love
To Steve Allen."

152
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,404
From the author of...

153
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,741
...and...

154
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,871
I cut my first
and only album:

155
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,623
"Sax on the Beach."

156
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:23,211
But then I spent all my money
on my $1,500-a-day habit.

157
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,465
I'd like another
Faberge egg, please?

158
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,467
Sir, don't you think
you've had enough?

159
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,344
I'll tell you
when I've had enough!

160
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,598
When was the last time
you worked?

161
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,976
In '86, when I did a guest shot
on "The Cosby Show."

162
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,687
Hey, kids.

163
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,232
Meet Grandpa Murphy.

164
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,692
But we have
three grandpas already.

165
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,237
This one's a great
jazz musician.

166
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,072
Oh, they all are.

167
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,658
You see, the kids...

168
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,785
They listen
to the rap music

169
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,246
which gives them
the brain damage

170
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,790
with their hippin'
and their hoppin'

171
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,625
and the bippin'
and the boppin'.

172
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,462
So they don't know
what the jazz is all about.

173
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,757
You see, jazz is like
a Jell-O pudding pop.

174
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,969
No. Actually, it's
more like Kodak film.

175
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,389
No. Actually,
jazz is like the new Coke.

176
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,349
It'll be around forever.

177
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,396
Wow! You've had
some career.

178
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,022
Although the moral
seems to be

179
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,441
that a lifetime of jazz
leaves you sad and lonely.

180
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,278
Well, before you
came to visit,

181
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,988
I would have agreed
with you.

182
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,950
This just in.

183
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,994
Krusty The Clown staged
a press conference today

184
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,329
to defend himself
against charges

185
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,706
that his products
are unsafe,

186
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,165
his theme park is
a deathtrap

187
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,875
and that he's
marketing videos

188
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,878
of Tonya Harding's
wedding night.

189
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,715
And I contend that those
tourists were decapitated

190
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,842
before they entered the
Krustyland House of Knives.

191
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,552
Next question.

192
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,804
What about that little boy
who got appendicitis

193
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,473
from eating your cereal?

194
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,684
To prove that this
metal "O" is harmless,

195
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,103
I will personally eat one.

196
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,105
See, there's nothing...

197
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,861
Ah, boy!

198
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,280
This thing
is shredding my insides!

199
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,407
Uh, Krusty, that wasn't
the metal one.

200
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,326
That was a regular
Krusty "O."

201
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,702
It's poison.

202
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,539
So, you all set
for your recital?

203
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,540
I sure am!

204
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,666
Look!

205
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,768
I stopped brushing my teeth

206
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,586
so I can play just like you.

207
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,296
Aw. Lisa, honey,

208
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,548
music comes from
what's in your heart,

209
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,091
not what's on your teeth.

210
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,760
Come on.
Let's jam.

211
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:41,557
Lift me,
won't you lift me.

212
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,853
Above the old routine?

213
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,855
Make it nice.

214
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,149
Play it clean.

215
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:53,736
Jazzman.

216
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:05,414
When the jazzman's
testifying.

217
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,001
A faithless man believes.

218
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:13,631
We can sing you
into paradise.

219
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:17,343
Or bring you
to your knees.

220
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,722
Jazzman.

221
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:25,935
Oh, jazzman.

222
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:34,026
Hey, Moe, what'll you give
me for an A.A. chip?

223
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,529
Barney, this is
a five-minute chip.

224
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,364
Eh. It's worth
the Pabst.

225
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,870
Baby, you are gonna
knock 'em dead.

226
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,583
Here...
Take this for luck.

227
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,419
Your sax!

228
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,546
Thank you so much!

229
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,263
Now, I have learned that most
of the orchestra

230
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,140
is having
their appendixes removed.

231
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,435
So, without further ado,
I give you the remnants

232
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,979
of the Springfield
Elementary School orchestra.

233
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,314
On saxophone,
Lisa Simpson.

234
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,692
On triangle,
Martin Prince,

235
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,527
and with a flute
up his nose,

236
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,610
Ralph Wiggum.

237
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,406
That's some nice flutin', boy.

238
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,742
They will be playing
"Stars And Stripes Forever,"

239
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,076
hopefully not forever.

240
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,082
This sucks!

241
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,640
Hey, Bleeding Gums,
I was great!

242
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,309
And I owe it all to...

243
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,894
What happened to Mr. Murphy?

244
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,896
I'm sorry. He passed away.

245
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,703
Lisa, honey, are you
gonna be okay?

246
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,497
Bleeding Gums
was my hero,

247
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,999
and I never got to
tell him how I felt.

248
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,876
Oh, I'm sure he knew.

249
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,504
And I'm sure that wherever
he is now, he's happy.

250
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,797
But he was the only person

251
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,841
who had the same love
for music that I do.

252
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,470
Thank you.

253
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,139
Oh, Dad,
why did he have to die?

254
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,267
Well, it's like the time
that your cat Snowball

255
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,894
got run over.

256
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,270
- Remember, honey?
- Yeah.

257
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,855
What I'm saying is

258
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,483
all we have to do
is go down to the pound

259
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,859
and get a new jazzman.

260
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,362
Oh, Dad!

261
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,826
Oh. I blew it again.

262
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:47,909
What?

263
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,499
Hey, Lis, you still upset
about that jazz guy?

264
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:57,044
If it helps,
I believe that after you die,

265
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,171
you can come back
as whatever you want.

266
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,631
I'll be a butterfly.

267
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,049
How come?

268
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:06,303
Because... nobody ever
suspects "the butterfly."

269
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,683
I didn't burn down the school.

270
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,518
It was the butterfly,
I tell you.

271
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,936
The butterfly!

272
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,272
He's crazy, boys.
Get the Taser.

273
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,405
Maybe I need
to talk to somebody

274
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,740
with a little more
age and wisdom.

275
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,743
Death stalks you
at every turn!

276
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,787
- Grampa.
- Well, it does.

277
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,541
There it is!
Death!

278
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,876
It's only Maggie.

279
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,169
Oh, yeah.

280
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,713
You know, at my age,

281
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,756
the mind starts
playing tricks, so...

282
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,800
Death!

283
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,427
That's only the cat.

284
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,430
Death!

285
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,931
That's Maggie again,
Grampa.

286
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,474
Oh. Where were we?

287
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,809
Death!

288
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,188
How come it won't
stop hurting?

289
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,190
Oh, Lisa,
it's normal

290
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,859
to be sad
when a friend dies.

291
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,153
And Bleeding Gums was
a good friend to you.

292
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,156
But nobody is really gone,
as long as we remember them.

293
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,284
Lisa, honey, if you really want
to preserve his memory,

294
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,119
I recommend getting a tattoo.

295
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,580
It preserves the things
you love.

296
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,041
"Starland Vocal Band?!"

297
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,208
They suck!

298
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,210
Death!

299
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,637
Isn't anybody gonna show up?

300
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,388
Well, Lisa,
we've waited an hour.

301
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:37,227
"Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

302
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,314
to bid farewell
to Blood and Guts Murphy."

303
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,608
No! It was
Bleeding Gums Murphy.

304
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,194
Ugh! Anyway,
"Bloody Gums Murphy

305
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,862
was quite
the sousaphone player... ".

306
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,946
Saxophone!

307
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,032
He was a jazz musician.

308
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,200
You didn't know him!

309
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,368
Nobody knew him!

310
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,994
But he was a great man.

311
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,579
And I won't rest

312
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,039
until all of Springfield

313
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,959
knows the name
Bleeding Gums Murphy!

314
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,878
And I won't rest
until I've gotten a hot dog.

315
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,546
Homer, this
is a cemetery.

316
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,674
Hot dogs! Get
your hot dogs here!

317
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,133
Whoo-hoo!

318
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,970
What do you do?
Follow my husband around?

319
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,847
Lady, he's putting
my kids through college.

320
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,270
Good news, Bart.

321
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:24,775
The Krusty-O Cereal Corp.
Has settled your case for $100,000,

322
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,193
less, of course,
my legal fees.

323
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,903
What kind of legal fees?

324
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,905
Well, for a case this complex,

325
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,992
I had to assemble a crack
team of lawyers:

326
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,910
Ronald Shaporo,
trial attorney.

327
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,453
Albert Dershman,
who can hold

328
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,330
three billiard balls
in his mouth.

329
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,040
How much of the hundred thou'
do I get?

330
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,253
Five hundred dollars?

331
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,380
- Yes, well, uh...
- Cool!

332
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,424
Glad you're happy.
Let's roll.

333
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,847
I can't believe it.
500 bucks.

334
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,182
Oh, just think what I can do
with that money.

335
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,353
$500 on red.

336
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,190
The winner is black.

337
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,318
Cool.

338
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,654
Mom, I want to honor
Bleeding Gums' memory,

339
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,239
but I don't know
where to start.

340
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,616
Maybe you could get
the local jazz station

341
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,535
to do a tribute to him, huh?

342
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,329
Jazz. They just make it up
as they go along.

343
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,748
I could do that.

344
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,960
That's "Mary Had
A Little Lamb."

345
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,295
Okay, then this.

346
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,608
That's the same thing.
You just replaced

347
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,134
"dees" with "doos."

348
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,803
Hi. I have a request.

349
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,947
I would like you
to do a tribute

350
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,222
to Bleeding Gums Murphy,
please.

351
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,515
Oh, I'd love to,
little sister,

352
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,933
but we don't
have his album.

353
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,268
What if I could find it?

354
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,853
Well, I'd spin it for you,

355
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,247
but, you know, ain't
no one gonna hear it.

356
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,273
Our broadcast range
is only 23 feet,

357
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,484
which makes us
the most powerful jazz station

358
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,902
in the entire U.S. of A.

359
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,987
Gee, your station
has a lot of problems.

360
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,071
Tell me about it.

361
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,823
Just look at
our morning guy.

362
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,868
Hello. This is Mole Man
in the morning.

363
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,995
Good mole man to you.

364
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,247
Today:
Part four of our series

365
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:06,543
of "The agonizing pain
in which I live every day."

366
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,465
$250?!

367
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,175
But I need that album

368
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,052
to honor the memory
of Bleeding Gums Murphy.

369
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,554
He's dead?
Well, why didn't you say so?

370
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,021
Where am I gonna get $500?

371
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,866
Now drive,
Smithers, drive!

372
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,917
Excuse me, my good man,
I have $500 to blow.

373
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,001
What have you got?

374
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,295
Behold! The ultimate pog.

375
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,422
I'll take it!

376
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,856
Lisa,
look what I've got.

377
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,691
Ta-da!

378
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,611
Bart, I can't believe it,
but why?

379
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,029
When I said
my stomach hurt,

380
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,990
you were the only one
who believed me.

381
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,702
Oh, thank you, but $500?

382
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,996
You'll never see
that much money again.

383
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,165
Oh, yeah?
Take a look at this.

384
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,420
I got the album.

385
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,549
Here. You can listen
to it on this.

386
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,513
I did the best I could,
Bleeding Gums.

387
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,538
Attention, all units.

388
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,540
Attention, all units.

389
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,042
Poison gas cloud
heading for...

390
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,047
Ah, that's nice.

391
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,715
Hey, it's getting cloudy.

392
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,469
Oh, boy.

393
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,899
That was for you,
Bleeding Gums.

394
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,738
You've made
an old jazzman happy, Lisa.

395
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,740
You must avenge
my death, Kimba...

396
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,951
I mean Simba.

397
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,578
Luke, I am
your father.

398
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,330
This is CNN.

399
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,957
Will you guys pipe down?

400
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,125
I'm saying good-bye
to Lisa.

401
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,169
We're sorry.

402
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,213
I don't want you to go.

403
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,132
Sorry, but I have to.
Good-bye.

404
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,093
Good-bye.

405
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,058
Oh, what the heck?

406
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,309
Once more from the top.

407
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,811
Yay!

408
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:21,488
When the jazzman's
testifying.

409
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:25,659
A faithless man believes.

410
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:29,705
He can sing you
into paradise.

411
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:34,584
Or bring you
to your knees.

412
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:38,588
Jazzman.

413
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,800
Take my blues away.

414
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:46,471
Make my pain
the same as yours.

415
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:50,684
With every change
you play.

416
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:54,604
Jazzman.

417
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:58,692
Oh, jazzman.

418
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,505
One more time!

419
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,007
Oh, come on, Lisa.

420
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,843
I got a date
with Billie Holiday.
