Are you sure you don't want

137
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,566
You had an awful lot of glass in you.

141
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,115
Oh, sometimes, we need
to get away from Hollywood.

142
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,031
LA is just so phony.

143
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,748
Well, why didn't you just
move to, say... Bethesda?

144
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,749
Not phony enough.

145
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,000
What we really like here
is the privacy.

146
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,462
Most people don't even know
where Springfield is.

147
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,593
Yeah. To tell you the truth,
I'm not even sure.

148
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,711
We're trying to keep a low profile.

149
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,468
We don't even go to the supermarket.

150
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,640
Yeah, we've been living off
congratulatory muffin baskets.

151
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,305

152
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,891
Don't just put that back in the basket.

153
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,385
I'm going to eat it later.

154
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,516
You shouldn't have to survive
on dry, crumbly muffins from...

155

156
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,978
You should let me do your shopping.

157
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,572
I know where I can get you
some great muffins.

158
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,283
No more muffins.

159
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,283
OK, fine, but I could do
all kinds of stuff for you.

160
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,366
I noticed that skylight
in your bedroom's broken.

161
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,462
Yeah, I'm not sure we need
an assistant, Mr. Simpson.

162
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,458
Please, Homer.

163
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,130
Come on. If you let me hang around awhile,
I can do all kinds of stuff for you.

164
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,380
Well, we are down to our
last roll of toilet paper.

165
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,763
And I have been brushing my teeth
with hair gel for a week.

166
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,181
I suppose we could give it a try.

167
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,969
Yeah. You owe me that much.

168
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:53,012
OK, you're on, but look,
nobody knows we're in Springfield,

169
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,517
and we want to keep it that way.

170
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,729
Will you promise to keep our secret?

171
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,938
Absolutely, if you promise to keep mine.

172
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,439
OK, what is it?

173
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,810
I can't read.

174
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,607
But you just read that card
from the Gersh Agency.

175
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,491
I recognized the logo.

176
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,858
(whistles)

177
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,486
Homie, are you OK?

178
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,493
We've been looking all over for you, Dad.
Where did you land?

179
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,826
Nowhere famous.

180
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,865
-Where'd you get that muffin?
-Gersh Agency.

181
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,665
(tires screeching)

182
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,222
Apu, I'm about to purchase
some weird and fruity items,

183
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,418
and I don't want any guff.

184
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,508
First of all, I'll need
the following mushrooms--

185
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,643
-Portobello.
-Yes.

186
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,639
-Porcini.
-Right.

187
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,850
-Chanterelle.
-Uh-huh.

188
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,930
And shiitake.

189
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,724
OK, we have none of those.

190
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,017
What is next?

191
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,230
A gallon of wheat grass juice,
a five-pound wad of tofu,

192
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,482
some jellied zinc
and a couple of pairs

193
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,194
of $600 sunglasses.

194
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,904
Mr. Simpson, these exotic items
are suspiciously different

195
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,776
from your usual order of beer and pork.
What gives?

196
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:55,414
Uh, nothing, nothing.
I'm just broadening my horizons.

197
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:59,213
Eh, by the way, do you have
extra-wide bumper stickers for a Humvee?

198
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,710
Wow! You got everything, Homer,
even the Oscar polish!

199
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,762
Honey, why don't you
give that thing a rest?

200
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,641
You're taking the finish off.

201
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,218
When you win one, you can take care of it
however you want.

202
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,228
-Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Meow.
-(doorbell rings)

203
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,518
I'll get it! I'll get it!

204
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,688
Yes?

205
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,061
Hi, I'm Ron Howard.

206
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,767
Ron Howard!

207
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,437
Yeah, I'm looking for
Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.

208
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,454
Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger?

209
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,410
Oh, hey, Ron, we heard you were looking
for a place in Springfield.

210
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,791
Yeah, well, it's the only town in America
that will let me fish with dynamite.

211
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,963
Uh, what's with him?

212
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,578
Oh, that's just Homer.
He's a new friend of ours.

213
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,206
Really? You giant stars
consider me a friend?

214
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:51,625
Well, for the first time in my life
I feel like I'm somebody.

215
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,426
Ronny, are you also my close friend?

216
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,260
(sniffs) Do I smell vodka and wheat grass?

217
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,807
It's called a lawnmower.
I invented it. You want one?

218
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,143
-Yeah, OK.
-And I'll have a rum and zinc.

219
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,807
Ooh, I'll have one of those, too.

220
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,265
Hey, can I crash here tonight?

221
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,815
Sure. We'll all stay.

222
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,235
A cell phone?

223
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,994
{\an8}Last Thursday's <i>Variety </i>?

224
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,624
{\an8}(whistles, gasps)

225
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,502
{\an8}I'll do that. You go upstairs
and have a beer.

226
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,249
Homer, when did you become
a member of PETA?

227
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,172
Well, you know me, I love animals.

228
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,341
Beef, chicken, veal.

229
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,630
If you're not part of the solution, Marge,
you're part of the problem.

230
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,215
-But that's not what PETA stands--
-(phone ringing)

231
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,181
-Imagine Films.
-Huh?

232
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,635
Uh, division of, um, Homerco.

233
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,978
And lift and strain

234
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,059
-and hyper-extend.
-(groans)

235
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,864
Keep those knees rigid.
Jerk that lower back.

236
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,569
Homer, I'm feeling
some sharp pains in my neck.

237
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,821
{\an8}That's right. Force it. Whip that neck!

238
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,656
Um, does anybody know
where this came from?

239
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:01,079
Oh, there's that movie script I wrote!
(chuckles)

240
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,950
Where did you find it?

241
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:03,907
On my pillow.

242
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,456
The important thing is

243
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,169
it's got the perfect part for you.
Either one of you.

244
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,710
It's about a killer
robot driving instructor

245
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,755
who travels back in time for some reason.

246
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,679
Ron Howard's attached to direct.

247
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,968
-I am not.
-Well, he expressed an interest.

248
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,552
-No, I didn't.
-Did, too.

249
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,717
-I did not!
-You lie!

250
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,018
Yeah, Homer, um, most movie scripts
are 120 pages.

251
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,271
This is only 17, and several of the pages

252
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,024
are just drawings of the time machine.

253
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,776
So you're saying you don't want to
star in my movie?

254
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,858
I'm sorry, Homer.

255
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,283
Well, if Alec is out, I'm out, too.

256
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,362
You're on your own, potsie.

257
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,782
<i>The Terminizor: An Erotic Thriller.</i>

258
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,826
(laughter)

259
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,040
So I'm in the grocery store the other day,
buying some cotton balls.

260
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,042
The absorbent kind?

261
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,083
(chuckles) You got that right, my friend.

262
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,166
(cheering)

263
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,961
So, I round the corner
and I head down the ointment aisle,

264
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,505
when who should I spot?

265
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,918
None other than Kent Brockman.

266
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:00,087
The local news guy? Mr. Channel Six?

267
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,637
-(all gasp)
-My God! What I'd give to meet him.

268
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,682
Ah, they don't come much bigger than that.

269
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,685
(blows raspberry)
Kent Brockman. Please!

270
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,308
Oh, what. I suppose
you've seen a bigger star?

271
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,226
I might have.

272
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,904
Come on, make with a name.

273
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,403
Oh, I can't. I promised I wouldn't.

274
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,566
Oh, yeah, right. You ain't seen nobody.

275
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,445
(laughter, chatter)

276
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,373
Please don't tell anyone we're here.

277
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,502
You've got to keep our secret, Homer.

278
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,576
Homer, we're out of vodka.

279
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,289
Tell the people, Homer.

280
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,254
They have a right to know about
the celebrity summer house.

281
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,626
-Who the hell are you?
-What do you care?

282
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,213
I'm telling you what you want to hear.

283
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,628
All right, I'm going to
let you guys in on something,

284
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:44,808
but you've got to keep it
much more secret than I did.

285
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,221
(grunts)

286
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,773
-(grunts)
-(grunts)

287
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,306
Yes! In your freckled face, Howard!

288
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,404
(mutters) Unbelievable.

289
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,863
-What?
-Nothing, nothing. Good hustle.

290
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,029
My God! The lemonade!

291
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,657
Look at the lemonade!

292
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:09,122
-(rumbling)
-Uh-oh.

293
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,285
(rumbling)

294
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,673
(clamoring)

295
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,672
Quick! Everybody inside.

296
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,927
The shuttlecock! Where's the shuttlecock?

297
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,639
(clamoring)

298
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,299
-(gasping)
-(door shuts)

299
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:30,637
(clamoring)

300
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,896
Yeah, I loved <i>Splash </i>, Mr. Howard.

301
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,899
It was totally, uh...

302
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,612
(grunts)

303
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,281
Uh, Miss Basinger,
those red pumps you wore

304
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,900
in <i>LA Confidential </i>were fabulous.

305
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,406
Where could I get a pair
for my, uh, mother?

306
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,239
-She wears a 12, double "E."
-Alec, Alec!

307
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,874
Regarding that so-called

308
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,831
silent propulsion system
in <i>The Hunt For Red October,</i>

309
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:54,212
I printed out a list of technical errors,
which I think you'd enjoy discussing.

310
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,503
<i>Somebody </i>must have told them <i>we live here.</i>

311
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,507
I'm looking at you, horshack.

312
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,839
Homer, how could you?

313
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,845
OK, OK, it was me.
I'm sorry, I blew your secret,

314
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,968
but you don't know
what it's like to be a nobody.

315
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:11,095
I just wanted to bask
in your reflected glory.

316
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,477
Reflected glory!

317
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,151
Homer, you betrayed our confidence.

318
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,361
I just don't think
we can be friends anymore.

319
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,901
But... Where will I bask?

320
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,486
Anywhere but here.

321
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,201
Come on, Ron, we're not wanted here.

322
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,490
All right, I'll go.

323
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,867
But the next time you want someone

324
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,373
to remind you which brother is which

325
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,705
or smell your hair

326
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,880
-while you're sleeping...
-(gasps)

327
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,838
...just remember, old Homer
won't be here anymore.

328
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,380
(people clamoring)

329
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,973
Wait a minute. Somebody's coming out.

330
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,589
Who is it? Is it anybody?

331
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,601
Nah, nah. It's nobody.

332
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,758
Throw your stones. It's nobody.

333
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:54,017
(clamoring)

334
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:02,355
Oh, how could Alec and Kim
just cut me out of their lives?

335
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,026
Homie, you haven't touched your food.

336
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:10,695
Oh, when Kim makes a manwich,
she uses focaccia bread.

337
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,914
And would it kill you
to put some fennel in it?

338
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,955
Alec Baldwin? Wow!

339
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,579
That is the coolest person
you've ever been fired by.

340
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,786
What was it like at their house?

341
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,666
Oh, it was so great.

342
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,423
I didn't have to fake it with them.

343
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,174
I was actually excited
to hear about their day.

344
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,677
I washed the dog today.

345
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,509
Was it the dog from the <i>Beethoven </i>movies?

346
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,604
Of course not.

347
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,098
Oh! Our dog isn't famous,

348
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,851
and you kids aren't exactly
John and Joan Cusack.

349
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,194
And you, you couldn't open a movie
if your life depended on it.

350
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,480
I'm about ready to ankle this family.

351
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:44,324
"Ankle"? "Focaccia"?
What are you talking about?

352
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:48,161
See? It's like we don't even
speak the same language anymore!

353
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,778
The only one who understands me
is that guy who married Martha Raye.

354
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:52,987
Don't blame us, Dad.

355
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,787
The celebrities are the ones
who canned you.

356
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,870
Hmm, she may not be famous,
but she's right.

357
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,957
Those big-shot stars
used me up and spit me out!

358
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,423
I did their laundry,
got their pictures developed,

359
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,054
took their garbage to the dump,

360
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,470
and I still got a car full of their crap.

361
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,143
Crap, eh?

362
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,232
Hey, is it too late
to see the movie stars?

363
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,850
Nah, nah, just hop that fence,

364
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,228
sneak up and, uh,
peek in the window there.

365
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,355
All right.

366
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,282
(grunts)

367
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,319
(laughs) I never get tired of that.

368
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,027
HOMER: <i>Attention, star-struck fools!</i>

369
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,906
Step right up and see the world's greatest
mobile collection

370
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,956
of Alec and Ron and Kim-orabilia.

371
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,380
(clamoring)

372
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,208
Only five... No, wait. Ten dollars.

373
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,463
You heard right, $20!

374
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,586
(clamoring)

375
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:51,088
(indistinct chatter)

376
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,469
Hey, it's Alec Baldwin's
MedicAlert bracelet!

377
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,175
That's right. Mr. Tough Guy can't handle
a little penicillin.

378
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,177
Oh, and look at this.

379
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,310
We can't even pay our bills

380
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:05,355
and they're drinking
(mocking) Royal Crown Cola.

381
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,031
Hey, hey, go easy on the celebrities, eh?

382
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,780
-Yeah, what gives you the right?
-Yeah.

383
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,322
We love celebrities.

384
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,865
Oh, yeah? What have they
ever done for you?

385
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,659
When was the last time Barbra Streisand
cleaned out your garage?

386
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,248
And when it's time to do the dishes,
where's Ray Bolger?

387
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:27,422
I'll tell you, Ray Bolger
is looking out for Ray Bolger!

388
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,298
KIM: Oh, look.

389
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,143
{\an8}Wasn't that a fun weekend?

390
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,968
{\an8}Yeah. Homer was a pretty good guy,

391
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,805
{\an8}and we just tossed him out
like a Golden Globe award.

392
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,063
{\an8}I've got to admit, I miss the way
he used to tuck us in

393
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,444
{\an8}-and kiss us on the forehead.
-Forehead?

394
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,941
Ah, maybe I should have made his movie.

395
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,734
Yeah, it wasn't that bad.

396
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,654
I mean, the script might even work
if you got rid of the talking pie.

397
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,948
What, are you crazy? It's a buddy picture.

398
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,122
Without the pie,

399
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,040
it would just be me on screen
for two hours.

400
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,578
Oh, yeah, and you'd hate that.

401
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,371
No, no, no. You can't lose the pie.

402
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,995
The pie is your heart.

403
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,252
{\an8}OK, OK. Keep the damn pie.

404
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,996
{\an8}The point is, we weren't fair to Homer.

405
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,007
He screwed up,
but he deserves another chance.

406
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,670
Yeah, everyone makes mistakes.

407
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,758
I mean, we'd want another chance
if one of us ever made a bad film, right?

408
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,395
I'm really looking forward
to seeing Homer again.

409
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,284
He always has the most interesting odors.

410
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,621
Ooh, look at me!

411
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,908
I'm Kim Basinger, the big movie star.

412
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:43,413
I'm so beautiful. I think I'm so great.

413
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,287
I'm too important
to take Homer to the Oscars.

414
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,835
-What the--
-(grunts)

415
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,088
And to think we were supporting
the museum of Hollywood jerks.

416
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,707
(tires screeching)

417
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,797
Let's get him.

418
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,221
And this time, it's personal.

419
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,591
What? It is personal.

420
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,430
He's got our underpants!

421
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,104
(tires screeching)

422
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,688
(horn honking)

423
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,560
I'll never outrun them in a museum!

424
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,187
-Pull over, you maniac!
-No!

425
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,185
Just jump over there, Alec.
It's not that far.

426
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,358
Yeah, you're a big screen tough guy.

427
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:17,784
Gee, I'd love to,

428
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,575
but I'm not really wearing
the right shoes.

429
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,698
(imitating a chicken)

430
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,826
Fine.

431
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,379
-(grunts)
-(shrieks)

432
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,626
{\an8}(laughs)

433
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,711
{\an8}Hey, I made it all by myself.

434
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,586
Hey, were you watching,
sweetheart? I made it!

435
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,133
-(thud)
-(grunts)

436
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,466
{\an8}(yells) My watch is caught!

437
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,762
Oh, for the love of...

438
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,604
Hold on. Can you drive?

439
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,431
Not well, but I'll give it a shot.

440
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,860
-(grunts)
-(rattling)

441
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,268
Oh, God!

442
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:55,526
(screaming)

443
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,571
(grunting)

444
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,317
I guess it's up to me.

445
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,158
(sighs)

446
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:03,986
(groaning)

447
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,617
BOTH: Ron!

448
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,870
You killed Ron Howard!

449
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,248
OK, I'll stop.

450
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,496
(gavel banging)

451
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:19,471
Mr. Simpson, do you have
anything to say for yourself?

452
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,591
Yes, I do.

453
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,557
I believe that famous people
have a debt to everyone.

454
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,269
If celebrities didn't want people
pawing through their garbage

455
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,520
and saying they're gay,

456
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,145
they shouldn't have tried
to express themselves creatively.

457
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,323
In closing,

458
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,320
you people must realize

459
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,401
that the public owns you for life.

460
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,737
And when you're dead,

461
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,741
you'll all be in commercials,

462
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,743
dancing with vacuum cleaners.

463
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,079
Thank you, your honor.

464
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,621
Mr. Simpson, you are forbidden
to come within 500 miles

465
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,166
of any celebrity, living or dead.

466
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,921
-(gavel banging)
-Whoo-hoo!

467
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,884
Well, I'll always have my crank calls.

468
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,925
(phone dialing)

469
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,138
Hello, old lady from <i>Titanic </i>?

470
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,389
You stink! (laughing)

471
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:12,186
And it grows
to a powerful, emotional climax

472
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,151
when the father has to choose

473
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,401
which one of his children will live,

474
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,649
and which one... will die.

475
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,318
-Pass.
-(sobbing)

476
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,407
What else you got?

477
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,831
Uh...

478
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,196
Well, well, there is this one thing.

479
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,867
It's about a killer robot
driving instructor

480
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,416
that travels back in time for some reason.

481
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,460
I'm listening.

482
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,503
OK, OK, well, you see,

483
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:40,046
this robot, he's got a heartbreaking
decision to make

484
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,182
about whether his best friend lives...

485
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,181
or dies.

486
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,801
Eh.

487
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,177
His best friend's a talking pie.

488
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,846
Sold! Howard, you've done it again.

489
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,234
<i>♪ These happy days Are yours and mine ♪</i>

490
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,732
<i>♪ These happy days Are yours and mine ♪</i>

491
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,904

492
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,318
(theme music playing)

493
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,646
Shh.
