Huh? Yeah, I was listening.
Very funny.

173
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,363
Oh, ya were not.
You were just eatin' a damn orange.

174
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,904
Oh, yes, yes.

175
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,067
To the untrained eye,
I'm eating an orange,

176
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,236
but to the eye that has brains,

177
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,235
I'm making a point
about marriage.

178
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:18,707
For you see, marriage
is a lot like an orange.

179
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,789
First you have the skin,

180
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,705
then the sweet,
sweet innards.

181
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,634
(chewing loudly)

182
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,719
I don't understand.

183
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,302
If I wanted to see
a man eat an orange,

184
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,017
I would have taken
the orange-eating class.

185
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:39,728
The eating of an orange is
a lot like a good marriage.

186
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,360
Just eat the damn oranges!

187
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,568
(students muttering)

188
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,899
This is terrible.

189
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,033
MRS. KRABAPPEL:
Ah! We're leaving.

190
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,689
Ach, let's get out of here.

191
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,818
This is a terrible excuse
for education.

192
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,905
Oh, I told Marge this wouldn't
work the other night in bed.

193
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,741
-In bed? Well.
-What?

194
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:59,536
So somethin' wasn't workin' in bed, huh?
Heh, heh, heh.

195
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,672
No, that's not what I meant.

196
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,289
Marge and I always
talk things over in bed.

197
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,337
Like the other night,
we were fighting about money.

198
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,760
Ooh, a fight.

199
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,838
Trouble in paradise, huh?
Heh, heh, heh.

200
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,465
I was telling Marge
that we could save some money

201
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,933
if she only dyed her hair
once a month.

202
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,813
-(gasps) Marge dyes her hair?
-Oh, yeah.

203
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,020
She's been as gray as a mule
since she was 17.

204
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,942
Ooh.
Come on. Tell us more.

205
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,150
WILLIE: Tell us about it.

206
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,781
I went on for hours, and they
were hanging on my every word.

207
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,239
-I really think I was born to teach.
-(tires screech)

208
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,160
All right, Simpson.
You were warned about teasing the box.

209
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,200
(screams)

210
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,453
<i>BOY: Wait! I need closure</i>
<i>on that anecdote.</i>

211
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,629
(cash register beeping)

212
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,301
Oh, Mrs. Simpson,
it may interest you to know,

213
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,472
we are having a sale
on blue dye number 52.

214
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,552
It is your hair color,
I believe.

215
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,677
Whatever do you mean?

216
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,814
I don't dye my hair.
(forced laughing)

217
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,442
Nah, nah, nah.
You got it wrong, 'Pu.

218
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,019
She's blue 56.

219
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,654
I don't know what
you're talking about.

220
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,071
We just love
your husband's class.

221
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,740
-That's nice.
-(vehicle speeds away)

222
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:17,868
Homer, I really don't like you telling
personal secrets in your class.

223
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,830
Marge, I didn't tell 'em
personal stuff.

224
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,581
Today at the Kwik-e-Mart
everybody knew I dyed my hair.

225
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,634
Oh. You mean about you.

226
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,668
All right, maybe I said some things,
some personal things.

227
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,763
But you should've
seen 'em, Marge.

228
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,628
They really wanted to hear
what I had to say.

229
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,835
Mmm. I'm happy about that.

230
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,934
But I think you
can be a good teacher

231
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,850
and still respect our privacy.

232
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,718
Look, Marge.
You don't know what it's like.

233
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,885
I'm the one out there every day
putting his ass on the line.

234
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,944
And I'm not out of order.
You're out of order!

235
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,649
The whole freakin' system
is out of order.

236
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,860
You want the truth?
You want the truth?

237
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,230
You can't handle the truth!

238
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:56,068
'Cause when you reach over
and put your hand into a pile of goo

239
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,905
that was your best friend's face,
you'll know what to do!

240
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,702
Forget it, Marge.
It's Chinatown!

241
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,918
Homer, don't ever tell them
personal stuff about me again!

242
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,079
(quietly) Yes, ma'am.

243
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,747
Now, what is a wedding?

244
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,085
Well, Webster's Dictionary
describes a wedding as

245
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,682
"The process of removing
weeds from one's garden."

246
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,469
(all groan)

247
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,602
Tell us more
about you and Marge.

248
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,430
This is a place of learning,
not a house of...

249
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,976
hearing about things.

250
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,769
-(students groan)
-Guess he's run out of stories.

251
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:28,693
What a rip-off.

252
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,731
I can't believe I paid $10,000
for this course.

253
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,067
What the heck
was that lab fee for?

254
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,902
No. Wait. Uh, um--

255
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,157
Wait. I-- Yes.
(clears throat)

256
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,950
I do have a story about
two other young marrieds.

257
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,115
(students murmuring)

258
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:50,875
Now, the wife of this couple
has an interesting quirk in the bedroom.

259
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,760
It seems she goes wild with desire
if her husband nibbles on her elbow.

260
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,840
-We need names!
-Well, let's just call 'em, uh,

261
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:02,716
Mr. "X" And Mrs. "Y."

262
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,465
So, anyway, Mr. "X" would say,

263
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,557
"Marge, if this doesn't
get your motor running,

264
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,813
my name isn't
Homer J. Simpson ."

265
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,765
(all gasping, murmuring)

266
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,744
-Huh?
-Ooh, Homer.

267
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,278
Don't you have to get to class?

268
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,951
Not tonight, Marge.

269
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,409
Tonight we can eat a nice,
leisurely dinner at home.

270
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,331
Oh. Well, that will be l--
(gasps)

271
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,119
What the darn?

272
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,785
Marge, you'll
never guess what.

273
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,504
My whole class is here.

274
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,424
They're going to observe
the human peep show

275
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,552
that is our lives.

276
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:39,339
Apparently, that disturbing odor
was the food.

277
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,933
So, little Lisa,
apple of my eye,

278
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,973
how are things down
at the old schoolhouse?

279
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:50,727
{\an8}I find this demeaning and embarrassing
beyond my worst nightmares.

280
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,861
(chuckling)

281
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,818
And how's my little
major leaguer?

282
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,229
Catch any june bugs today?

283
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,318
Well, me and Milhouse took
some mail from a mail truck

284
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,613
and threw it down the sewer.

285
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,866
Son, I know you meant well,

286
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,198
but that wasn't
the right thing to do.

287
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,744
What the hell are you
talkin' about?

288
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,247
You're the one
who double-dared us.

289
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,459
Why, you little--

290
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,498
-(choking)
-CLASS: Ooh.

291
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,501
Homer!

292
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,422
-I'm outta here.
-Me too.

293
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,131
(students murmuring quietly)

294
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,801
(forced laughing)

295
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,010
Well, now that the little ones
have toddled off to bed--

296
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:24,551
I want this to end now.

297
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,807
Hey, Homer.
Why don't you just nibble her elbow?

298
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,020
That always melts her butter, right?
Heh, heh, heh.

299
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,101
(gasps)

300
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,516
All right.

301
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,774
Okay.
Everybody out!

302
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,026
Ooh,
she's gotta have it.

303
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:42,488
Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!
Get out-out-out-out-out-out-out!

304
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,281
All right, we're breaking early
tonight, class.

305
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,445
For tomorrow, you should read
pages seven through 18

306
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,454
in Lisa's diary.

307
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,615
-You too.
-Huh?

308
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,662
Get out!

309
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,575
But I'm not
in the cla--

310
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,626
Is any of this gonna
be on the test?

311
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,709
'Cause I wasn't
payin' attention.

312
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:08,759
Come on, Marge. Let me in!
There's crickets out here.

313
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,402
Okay, Marge. Things were said.
Mistakes were made.

314
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,648
Let's end this madness
and get on with our lives.

315
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,901
You just don't get it,
do you, Homer?

316
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,444
You told personal things
about our lives,

317
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,148
even after
you promised you wouldn't.

318
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,658
-I can't trust you anymore.
-But I learned my lesson.

319
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,411
It'll never happen again.

320
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,833
Hey, Homer.
What's the big brouhaha-ha?

321
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,622
Ah, Marge is throwin' me out

322
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,456
-for blabbin' about her elbow thing.
-(groans)

323
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,464
Honey, the door blew shut.

324
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,711
Oh. Fine.

325
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,127
If that's what you want,
you've got it.

326
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,756
This scene is gettin' old, man.
I'm hittin' the road.

327
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,265
Maybe I'll drop you a line
someday from wherever I wind up

328
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,268
in this crazy old world.

329
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:01,534
Kids, your father and I are going
through a really tough time right now,

330
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,819
and I don't know
what's going to happen.

331
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,783
But just remember that both your mom
and your dad love you very, very much.

332
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,288
Wow, I've never seen Mom
so mad at Homer before.

333
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,119
{\an8}I'll tell you
a secret, Bart.

334
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,004
{\an8}Every time I'm worried
about Mom and Dad,

335
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,791
{\an8}I go to the attic and add
to my ball of string.

336
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:21,798
(screeches)

337
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,433
Earth base, this is
commander Bart McCool.

338
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,718
We are under attack by
the Zorrinid brain changers.

339
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,392
Quickly, into
the safety dome, Milbot.

340
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,222
(in monotone)
Affirmative, humanoid.

341
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,562
BOTH: Ew!

342
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,734
Don't mind me, boys.
Just scrubbin' my undies.

343
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:42,322
Sorry, Bart.
Your dad kinda blew the fantasy.

344
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,529
I only like it
when I'm pretend-scared.

345
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,991
Keep up the roughhousing, son.

346
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,741
Without a strong male
presence in the house,

347
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,743
you could turn
sissy overnight.

348
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,195
Oh, these stubborn
grass stains.

349
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,080
Oh, good.

350
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,826
Reverend Lovejoy will
make Marge take me back.

351
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,048
He has to push
the sanctity of marriage,

352
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,548
or his god will punish him.

353
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,591
-Get a divorce.
-Mm-hmm.

354
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,125
But isn't that a sin?

355
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,598
Marge, just about
everything is a sin.

356
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,929
You ever sat down
and read this thing?

357
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,184
Technically, we're not
allowed to go to the bathroom.

358
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,353
(sighs)

359
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,147
(moans softly)

360
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,571
{\an8}Good night, Marge.
(kisses)

361
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,276
Oh, why didn't I take
a picture?

362
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,612
I had ten years
to take a picture.

363
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:34,788
Hmm. Funny the way everything
reminds me of Homer.

364
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,085
HOMER'S VOICE:
I love you.

365
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,802
Will you marry me, Marge?

366
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,183
You mean,
I'm gonna be a daddy?

367
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:57,221
I hope we'll always be
together, together, together--

368
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,017
-Together?
-(tires screech)

369
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,561
(screams, grunting)
Ooh.

370
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,488
Here, Dad. I brought you some nice--
(yelps)

371
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,819
Good news, Lisa. I don't need
your mother anymore.

372
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:16,235
I've created a replacement that's
superior to her in almost every way.

373
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,696
Dad, that's just a plant.

374
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,037
Lisa! You will respect
your new mother.

375
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,123
Now, give her a kiss.

376
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,587
Kiss her!
(yelps)

377
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,878
Oh-my-God! Oh-my-God!
Oh-my-God! (panting)

378
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,724
All right.
Let's get our stories straight.

379
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,509
She tripped, right?

380
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,264
Look. I brought you
some nice pudding.

381
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:40,516
Ah, your flesh mother
used to bring me pudding.

382
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,561
Oh, I miss Marge.

383
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:46,074
Lisa, you're smart.
Help me trick her into taking me back.

384
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,478
Dad, you can't trick somebody
into loving you.

385
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,737
There's a reason two people
come together and stay together.

386
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,860
There's something
they give each other

387
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,616
that nobody else can give them.

388
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,578
If you want to get Mom back,
you just have to remember

389
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,038
what you give her
that nobody else can.

390
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,999
I'll pay you $40
if you think of it for me.

391
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,251
-No.
-Okay. 30.

392
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,626
Good luck, Dad.

393
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,051
All right, brain.
It's all up to you.

394
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,130
If you don't think of what it is,
we'll lose Marge forever.

395
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,967
{\an8}<i>Eat the pudding. Eat the pudding.</i>
<i>Eat the pudding.</i>

396
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,222
{\an8}<i>Eat the pudding.</i>
<i>Eat the pudding. Eat the pudding.</i>

397
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,393
{\an8}<i>Eat the pudding.</i>
<i>Eat the pudding.</i>

398
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,521
Okay, but then
we gotta get to work.

399
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,729
(eating loudly)

400
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,810
(moans softly)

401
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,189
(doorbell chimes)

402
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,113
(exhales)

403
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,242
(clears throat)
Oh. H-hi, Marge.

404
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,109
I heard you and Homer broke up,

405
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,946
so I'm declarin' my intentions
to move in on his territory.

406
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,543
Here, I, uh,
brung ya some posies.

407
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,329
Oh, my.

408
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:46,422
I'm very flattered, but
I'm not really interested.

409
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,500
Sheesh. I come here,
I get dressed up all nice-like,

410
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:55,257
put my heart on the line,
and I make a fool of myself.

411
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,802
Oh, boy. Oh, I'm gonna
start bawlin' here.

412
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,637
Hmm, why don't you come inside
for a drink of water?

413
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:02,983
'Kay.

414
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:10,274
Hmm. Clean house,
no silverfish.

415
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,107
Could've been very happy here.

416
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,652
(knocking)

417
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,985
-Homer.
-Moe.

418
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,065
-What are you doin' here?
-I, um-- Well, I--

419
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,238
I never touched her, Homer.

420
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,365
Homer, I swear,
I never touched her.

421
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,001
MARGE:
Here's your water, Moe.

422
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,038
I didn't ask her
for no water.

423
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,211
She's lyin', Homer,
she's lyin'.

424
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,709
She told me you were dead.

425
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,790
That's the only reason I--
I didn't do nothin'!

426
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,167
(glass breaking, Moe shouts)

427
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,303
Bye, Moe.

428
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,379
Homer,
what happened to you?

429
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:38,144
Marge, I figured out what
I can give you that no one else can:

430
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:41,808
A bouquet of po-- Ohhh.

431
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,349
I give up. I don't deserve
to live with you.

432
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:52,565
-Hmm.
-(table bumps against wall)

433
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,899
Oh. My tattered rags

434
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,816
are caught on
your coffee table.

435
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,326
Oh, here.
Let me help you.

436
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,245
(muttering softy)

437
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,172
{\an8}Wait a minute.
Wait, that's it.

438
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,210
I know now what I can offer you
that no one else can:

439
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,415
Complete and utter dependence.

440
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,626
Homer, that's not a good thing.

441
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,427
Are you kidding?
It's a wondrous, marvelous thing.

442
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:26,432
Marge, I need you more than
anyone else on this entire planet

443
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,386
could possibly
ever need you.

444
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,807
I need you to take care of me,
to put up with me

445
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,187
and most of all,
I need you to love me,

446
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,864
because I love you.

447
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,903
(sad grunt)

448
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,656
But how do I know
I can trust you?

449
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,449
Marge, look at me.
We've been separated for a day,

450
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,703
and I'm as dirty as a Frenchman.

451
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,246
In another few hours
I'll be dead.

452
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,959
I can't afford
to lose your trust again.

453
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:08,058
I must admit,
you really do make a gal feel needed.

454
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,021
Wait till my class
hears about this.

455
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,772
Kidding!

456
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:16,653
(sighs) Oh, it's great to be
indoors with my family.

457
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,653
I'm really glad
you're back, Dad.

458
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,105
I knew you could do it.

459
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,855
Now don't screw it up.

460
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,528
{\an8}Look, Dad.
I missed you so much,

461
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,236
{\an8}I couldn't concentrate in
school and I got an "F."

462
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,447
{\an8}Hey, this is dated
two weeks ago.

463
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,868
Oh. Sorry.
Here's a fresh one.

464
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,577
And I have a special
present for you,

465
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,088
but I'll give it
to you later tonight.

466
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,840
Special present? I don't
wanna wait. I want it now!

467
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,013
I want the children to see.

468
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,142
Ooh.
Oh, right.

469
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,849
Later.
(chuckling)

470
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,430
So, Marge, are you
really happy? Really?
