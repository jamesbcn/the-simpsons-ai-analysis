I ran into some schoolmates

might be friendly.

142

hang out at the mall together?

143

00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,308
Aw, sweetie, hey,
why don't you make friends

175
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,606
with my new computer?

176
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,649
-Okay.
-Let me just finish downloading

177
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,283
the complete works
of Shakespeare.

178
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,200
(humming)

179
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,620
(sneaky chuckle)

180
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,788
Now who's the greatest writer
of all time?

181
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,285
I'd have more friends
if I knew what people liked,

182
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,964
but I won't know what people like
unless I'm their friend.

183
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,463
It's a conundrum.

184
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,165
Helpful hint:
If you want friends,

185
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,255
don't use words like "conundrum."

186
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,420
(phone rings)

187
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,388
<i>-JIMBO: Co-what-drum?</i>
-Jimbo heard me say it.

188
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,468
I'm dead.

189
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,404
Hmm.

190
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,819
It's easier to be friends
with lots of people online

191
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,985
than one person in person.

192
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,164
What if I started
an online meeting place

193
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:41,623
where all are equal
and I am the undisputed center?

194
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,170
(both grunting)

195
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,880
How's this for a conundrum?

196
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,251
It's not really a conundrum.

197
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,167
Sit at my feet,
and I will elaborate.

198
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,970
So, to summarize, Your Honor,

199
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:02,015
Lisa Simpson created
this "social network"

200
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,101
because she had no friends.

201
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,517
No, that is not true. I...

202
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,937
May I remind you
you're under oath?

203
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,735
All right already.

204
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,858
I had no friends.

205
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,704
With a attitude like that,
I wouldn't be her friend.

206
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,531
Life is too dang short.

207
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,618
So, since I had no friends,
I assembled a motley crew

208
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,874
of the friendless to help me
construct my social network.

209
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,037
Did we become friends?
No.

210
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,246
(overlapping chatter)

211
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,053
As the CEO of SpringFace,
I want you all to have fun

212
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,554
as you write source code

213
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,386
until you fall asleep
at your consoles.

214
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,641
-(all agreeing)
-Delightful.

215
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:43,272
Here's my favorite
computer game: Angry Nerds.

216
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,191
(squawks)

217
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,649
(all snorting like pigs)

218
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,899
Nelson, is there any way
I could be your friend?

219
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,283
The only way
I would be your friend

220
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,991
is if I could click a box
under your picture saying

221
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,572
"Accept friendship request from."

222
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,988
Nelson, you've just given us
the template for our site.

223
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,498
I don't care.

224
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,500
(grunts)

225
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,331
(clatter like bowling pins)

226
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,536
(groans)

227
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,053
If we don't move,
his odds of getting us both

228
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,420
are 374 to one.

229
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,337
Ooh-oo-ooh, ooh.

230
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,597
(grunts)
Bye.

231
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,180
(keyboards clatter)

232
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,885
Now, to skip ahead,

233
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:28,095
your diabolical plan
was an instant success.

234
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,357
I never said it was diabolical.

235
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,019
Withdrawn.

236
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,776
This social network
quickly unified

237
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:39,451
the disparate children
of Springfield Unified.

238
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,542
Oh, I just got invited
to make out with Shauna.

239
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,698
See?

240
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,286
That went out to 200 guys.

241
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,542
(groans)

242
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,043
And seven girls.

243
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,375
(brightly)
Oh...

244
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,129
Santa's Little Helper's friends

245
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,131
with Snowball Two?

246
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,723
Now I've seen everything.

247
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,048
Ha, all my friends
have birthdays this year.

248
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,215
(typing)

249
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,642
(click)

250
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,971
(chuckles)
I just un-friended Skinner

251
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,306
Doggone it.
I'm less popular

252
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,142
than the hornet's nest
in the gym.

253
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,227
You said you were
getting rid of that nest.

254
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,692
We trade the honey
for chalk and yardsticks.

255
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:13,653
Hornets make honey?

256
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,943
Better than wasp honey,
not as good as bee.

257
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,696
Is this how
you talk on dates?

258
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,488
I wish my dates
were this interesting.

259
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,990
Hit refresh.

260
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,244
-(click)
-Hit refresh.

261
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,235
(gasps)
I have a thousand friends.

262
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,497
And only eight
of them are Milhouse.

263
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,000
A thousand kids?

264
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,131
If you could get each of them
to send you a dollar,

265
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,248
you'd be a millionaire.

266
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,964
Well, it's not just
kids using SpringFace,

267
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,415
it's moms like me, Marge.

268
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,046
Wait a minute,
grown-ups are on this?

269
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,684
Yeah, look.

270
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,890
We've got to thank you, kiddo.

271
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,517
We've gotten so much more
action since we signed up

272
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,265
and used this picture
of ourselves.

273
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,516
(raspy chuckling)

274
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,858
-That's not you.
-You can see

275
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,282
our reflection
in the sunglasses.

276
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,112
(chuckling)

277
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,698
Wow, I've created something
incredibly popular.

278
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,115
And I've created something

279
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,373
that created something
incredibly popular.

280
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,325
And I created
an alcoholic hippo.

281
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,875
You never showed it to me.

282
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,998
A stupid alcoholic hippo.

283
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,625
-I still want to see it.
-There is no hippo.

284
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:18,923
Then why did you say it?

285
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,796
'Cause you're the hippo.

286
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,013
Are you just saying that

287
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,512
'cause you don't want me
to see the hippo?

288
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,644
I don't have a hippo!

289
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:32,274
And so, this so-called
"SpringFace"

290
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,983
spread from the world
of children to adults.

291
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,944
Man, this Web site
makes talking drunk

292
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,065
to my wife so much safer.

293
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,742
I am sitting here...

294
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,282
zero sheets to the wind...

295
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,906
(sneaky chuckle)

296
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,252
<i>HOMER: ...counting the moments</i>
<i>to closing time</i>

297
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,408
<i>when I can stumble home to you.</i>

298
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,077
<i>Another round, Moe.</i>

299
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,745
<i>Uh-oh, did I type that?</i>

300
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,424
<i>Delete! Delete!</i>

301
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,092
<i>Hmm, typing "delete"</i>
<i>does not delete.</i>

302
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,341
(puzzled groan)

303
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:04,302
It is gratifying to see
all of you bowing in prayer,

304
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,965
the light of God
shining on your faces.

305
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:12,055
Uh-oh, Bernice Hibbert keeps
"liking" Bumblebee Man's posts.

306
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:15,022
That's how it starts.
Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk.

307
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:18,234
Why did I make this church
a Wi-Fi hotspot?

308
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,025
(groans)
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

309
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,110
Let's see, which Muppet am I?

310
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,486
Beaker?

311
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,123
Hm, I guess that's fair.

312
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,989
Friend, friend,

313
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,156
awaiting reply, friend...

314
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,445
Sherri? Terri?

315
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,828
Hopscotch?

316
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,714
Double Dutch?
Ringolivio?

317
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,341
Anyone?

318
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,125
Oh, I have a thousand friends,

319
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,005
and I feel more alone than ever.

320
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,262
Whee!

321
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,433
I am trying
to set a mood here.

322
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,812
(somberly)
Whee.

323
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,719
So, to sum up,

324
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,387
Lisa's social network

325
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,265
turned into the biggest
Internet failure since...

326
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,403
(chuckles)
Well, there've been so many.

327
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,070
"Ask Jeeves," anyone?

328
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,859
(raucous laughter)

329
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,408
(horse neighs)

330
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:25,173
And so SpringFace became
too big to control,

331
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,677
just like the 60-foot baby
in my self-published novel,

332
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,011
<i>The 60 Ft. Baby.</i>

333
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,215
Order it online now,
while you can still cheat

334
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,056
the government on sales tax.

335
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,521
(clears throat)
As I was saying,

336
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,692
SpringFace was used
in ways I never expected.

337
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,442
(typing)

338
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,943
(video game gunfire)

339
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,946
Thanks for SpringFacing me
your head cleaver, Bart.

340
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,909
(screaming)

341
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,699
(magazine reloading)

342
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,703
(gunfire)

343
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,294
(screaming)

344
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,869
Check this out: I'm hiding
a bomb in this pile of corpses,

345
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,665
so when Kearney
loots their ammo,

346
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,748
he gets a face full
of ass shrapnel.

347
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,173
(explosion)

348
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,051
Damn, I got ass-shrapped!

349
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,378
(groans)

350
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,883
(tires squealing)

351
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,177

352
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,099
That idiot cut me off.

I'm gonna run his plates,

354
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,230
find out who he is, then change
his SpringFace profile picture

355
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,808
to a shot of a monkey.

00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,233

Get that, Marge?

357
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,771

-Homer, watch the road.
-Right.

359
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,025

is... watching... the...

Somebody call 911!

370
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,508
I don't know how to use
the phone on my phone.

371
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,135
Hey, did you guys get
my picture of the fire?

372
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,352
Yeah, I did;
nice grab.

373
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,932
-I didn't get it yet.
-Yeah, funny how that works.

374
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,018
Lisa Simpson,
can you give us any reason

375
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,614
why the city should not force
you to shut down your site?

376
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,991
I know it's awful and insular

377
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,359
and caused 35 deaths,
but I had friends.

378
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,618
Four digits of friends!

379
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,290
I had a friend in common
with Malcolm Gladwell.

380
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,119
He friends everybody.

381
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,544
Fine.
I'll shut down the site.

We just realized you don't
have to play in a pool.

394
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,078
You really want me?

395
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,583

No. We want your Dad.

You're gonna lose yet again.

Oh, wait, you can.

they started

Why can't we pull away?

409

Because we can't
stop concentrating

410
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,915
on that $65 million
Facebook settlement,

411
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,547
which somehow wasn't
enough for us.

412
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,474

(thunderclap, bat screeching)

420
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,167
<i>Once there was</i>
<i>a young rascal named Bart.</i>

421
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,670
<i>This lad was trouble</i>
<i>from the very start.</i>

422
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:38,433
<i>When it came to mischief,</i>
<i>he had a black thumb.</i>

423
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,260
<i>It didn't hurt</i>
<i>that his daddy was dumb.</i>

424
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,927
<i>And when it came</i>
<i>to best friends,</i>

425
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,767
<i>it was Milhouse who picked him.</i>

426
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:52,522
<i>Sometimes the sidekick,</i>
<i>sometimes the victim.</i>

427
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:56,698
<i>Then one day</i>
<i>at school engulfed in ennui,</i>

428
00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:00,618
<i>Bart dreamed of wrapping</i>
<i>the place in T.P.</i>

429
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:04,039
<i>So off to the discount store</i>
<i>they did skulk.</i>

430
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:07,789
<i>With the evil intent</i>
<i>of buying in bulk.</i>

431
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,213
<i>They went to the school</i>
<i>and put up a ladder.</i>

432
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,553
<i>Only to wait</i>
<i>for Milhouse's bladder.</i>

433
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:20,548
<i>All that evening</i>
<i>they unfurled with delight.</i>

434
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,886
<i>And soon the school</i>
<i>was covered in white.</i>

435
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:27,392
<i>The mischievous boys</i>
<i>had done their best.</i>

436
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,976
<i>When an eagle approached,</i>
<i>needing a nest.</i>

437
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,860
<i>They tried to escape</i>
<i>with struggles and squirms.</i>

438
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:39,452
<i>But all they got</i>
<i>was a diet of worms.</i>

439
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:42,819
<i>There they remained</i>
<i>to this very day.</i>

440
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,738
