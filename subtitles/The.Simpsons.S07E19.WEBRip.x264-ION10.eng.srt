{\an8}Well, it's not quite a mop,

21
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,860

00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:04,938

I don't know.

{\an8}BART: Why'd they make
that one Muppet out of leather?

26
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,784
{\an8}That's not a leather Muppet.
That's Troy McClure.

27
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,485
{\an8}Oh, back in the '70s, he was
quite the teen heartthrob.

28
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,707
{\an8}Yeah. Who'd have thought he'd
turn out to be such a weirdo?

29
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,119
{\an8}What are you talking about?

30
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,127
{\an8}You know--
his bizarre personal life.

31
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,589
{\an8}Those weird things they say
he does down at the aquarium.

32
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,130
{\an8}-Why, I heard...
-Oh, Homer, that's just an urban legend.

33
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,675
{\an8}People don't do that
type of thing with fish.

34
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,639
Troy McClure's
a perfect gentleman

35
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,389
like Bing Crosby or J.F.K.

36
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,142
I wonder where Troy is now?

37
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,148
TROY: Hey, these guys
are all over the road.

38
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,574
-(siren blaring)

39
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,161
All right, Captain Rush-Rush.

40
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,792
Out of the car. Ow!

41
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,788
Oh, I'm seeing stars here.

42
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,081
No, just one.

43
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,754
Hi, I'm Troy McClure.

44
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,213
You may remember me
from such films as

45
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,172
<i>The Greatest Story Ever Hulaed</i>

46
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,383
and <i>They Came</i>
<i>to Burgle Carnegie Hall.</i>

47
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,343
Uh... 'fraid not.

48
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,593
License, please.

49
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,675
Says here you need
corrective lenses.

50
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,812
Put those glasses on, mister.

51
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,229
You wouldn't ask
a handsome man like me

52
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,308
to wear glasses.

53
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,983
It'd be a crime against nature.

54
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,022
(groans)

55
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,526
Gaa! Well, they do kind of
make you look like a nerd.

56
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:35,029
Tell you what, just go down to the D.M.V.
tomorrow and try to pass that eye test.

57
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:39,033
I'll tear up this ticket but I'm still
going to have to ask you for a bribe.

58
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,542
Hello, Marge. Hello, Marge.

59
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,793
How come no Chippendales dancers

60
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,336
ever come in to renew
their licenses?

61
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,800
They carpool.

62
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,130
That's the problem.

63
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,428
Hey, I came here
to get this revoked.

64
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,557
Troy McClure?

65
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:01,888
I thought he disappeared

66
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,523
after that scandal
at the aquarium.

67
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,480
Hey, I thought you said
Troy McClure was dead.

68
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,731
No, what I said was he
sleeps with the fishes.

69
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,944
-You see...
-Uh, Tony, please, no.

70
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,145
I just ate a whole plate
of dingamagoo.

71
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,818
Whoa! Troy McClure!

72
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,002
Oh..! Hello, beautiful.

73
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,380
John Law tells me I might need
to wear these glasses.

74
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,749
You? Nonsense.
You're Troy McClure.

75
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:36,217
I remember you from such
films as <i>Meet Joe Blow</i>

76
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,549
and <i>Give My Remains</i>
<i>to Broadway.</i>

77
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,296
Stars like you
don't need glasses.

78
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,138
Yech!

79
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,805
Now, Mr. McClure,

80
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,393
would you like to take off
those glasses

81
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,898
and read the top line?

82
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,111
Uh... "W"

83
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,782
seven...

84
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,530
star, pound...

85
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,822
duh...

86
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,695
Look, Miss Bouvier.

87
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,453
As an actor, I depend on
my remarkable looks.

88
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,169
If you could find it
in your heart to pass me,

89
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,169
I'm sure I could find
some way to repay you.

90
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,961
(gulping)
Mubble.

91
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,214
Say, by buying you dinner?

92
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,217
That took a lot of class.

93
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,889
All these celebrities on
the walls-- I just know

94
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,397
a big star like you
is up there somewhere.

95
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,569
Uh, yes, I'm over there.

96
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,399
Selma (grunting):
Hmm...

97
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,824
Hmm?

98
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,862
Hm-mmm.

99
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,569
-Ohm...
-(yowls)

100
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,870
So, working at the D.M.V.
must be very interesting.

101
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,253
Well, uh, I think I'm getting
repetitive stress disorder

102
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,211
from scratching my butt all day.

103
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,632
(clearing throat)

104
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,671
Being a huge movie star
must be good, too.

105
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,465
What are you
working on now?

106
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,719
I've been reading
a lot of scripts lately.

107
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,641
You know, it's a lot cheaper
than going to the movies.

108
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,562
Well, thanks for holding up
your end of the bargain.

109
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,855
I had a pretty good time.

110
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,018
Yeah, me too.

111
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,396
You need a ride somewhere?

112
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,942
Hey, get a load of this.

113
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,526
Troy McClure
and what looks like a date.

114
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,775
Here you go, boys.

115
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,615
A little something
for Page One.

116
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,584
Hey, Homer, isn't this
your sister-in-law

117
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,125
on a date
with Troy McClure?

118
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,288
Troy McClure.

119
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,916
He's a washed-up movie star.

120
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,383
He could be dating
washed-up supermodels.

121
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,054
Well, I don't know.

122
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,052
Maybe those rumors
about his fish fetish

123
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,474
weren't true after all.

124
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,262
Ah, this changes
everything.

125
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,466
I'd pay to see him
in a movie now.

126
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,846
If only that
were possible.

127
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,356
(phone ringing)

128
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,648
<i>Troy, my man,</i>
<i>it's MacArthur Parker.</i>

129
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,322
MacArthur Parker, the agent?

130
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,070
MacArthur Parker, my agent?

131
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,652
Just checking in, my friend.

132
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,657
So, how's my favorite client?

133
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,489
We haven't spoken
in eight years.

134
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,544
Yes. So, I saw
the papers today, Troy.

135
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,079
Looking good.

136
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,502
That wholesome stuff
really helps

137
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,120
when I'm trying
to find you work.

138
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,417
You haven't found me work
in 12 years.

139
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,751
Oh, you...
Uh, jury duty is work.

140
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,086
And, listen,
you keep getting seen in public

141
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,382
with human females,
and I can get you work

142
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,836
in the entertainment industry.

143
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,389
Hey...

144
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:35,306
Hello, Selma Bouvier?
It's Troy McClure.

145
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,015
You may remember me
from such dates

146
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,555
as last night's dinner.

147
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:44,243
That's right, boys,
Troy's back from the gutter

148
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,660
and he's brought
someone with him.

149
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,369
(theatrical laughter)

150
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,079
That's too funny.

151
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,659
I can't remember when I've heard
a funnier anecdote.

152
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,535
Okay, now, you tell one.

153
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,712
Well, not much happens to me,

154
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,131
but I once had dinner
with a movie star,

155
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,591
and it was the most wonderful
night of my life.

156
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,883
Really?
Who was it, George Segal?

157
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,337
I hear he plays the banjo.

158
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,845
Um, yeah...

159
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,140
(gasping)

160
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,643
(crowd murmurs)

161
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,515
Excuse me, I ordered a Zima,
not emphysema.

162
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,733
Please, don't smoke
in our restaurant.

163
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,444
We don't serve
contemporary California cuisine

164
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,775
in your lungs.

165
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,704
Troy, uh, I'm sorry
I ruined our evening.

166
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,912
I have to go now.

167
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,453
Oh, my God.

168
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,746
(labored breathing)

169
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh, God, I'm such a fool.

170
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:43,214
Got a light?

171
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,513
(both coughing)

172
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,845
Oh...

173
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,101
Sounds like you're really
falling for him.

174
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,895
What's the matter,
I'm not fun enough for you?

175
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,479
Patty. Go on, Selma,

-Uh-huh.
-Remember when we were kids,

about our ideal husbands?

Guess which one?

It's Selma, right?

Apparently, he doesn't
really love Selma,

to help his career.

the Troy McClure I remember

347
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,511
from such films
as <i>Make-Out King of Montana</i>

348
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,676
and <i>The Electric Gigolo.</i>

349
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,385
(low chuckling)

350
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,265
Yeah, in a minute, darling.

351
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,442
Well, she may be helping
my career

352
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,561
but she's starting
to cramp my style.

353
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,938
Oh, who cares?
The offers are rolling in.

354
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,935
Paramount wants you
for a buddy comedy

355
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,607
with Rob Lowe and Hugh Grant.

356
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,866
-Those sick freaks?
-Okay, then get this.

357
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,739
I think they want you
to play McBain's sidekick

358
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,747
in, brace yourself,
the new McBain movie.

359
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,920
McBain's sidekick? Hot damn!

360
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,459
I'm going to Sea World!

361
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,753
Selma...

362
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,916
about you and Troy--

363
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,795
we're not sure
he's... all he seems.

364
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:50,843
Marge is right.

365
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,386
He's wrong for you.

366
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,639
Better you find out
sooner than later.

367
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,602
Wrong for me? How?

368
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,192
Oh, I get it.

369
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,849
My sisters have come down

370
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,807
with a case
of the green-eyed gazongas.

371
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,027
I guess
I shouldn't be surprised.

372
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,858
You're stuck
in a menial job

373
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,743
you'll be doing ten
years after you die.

374
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,200
And you're
tied down to a man

375
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,410
who'd have to bathe
to be a slob.

376
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,950
Selma, Troy doesn't
love you at all.

377
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,905
He's only using you

378
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,115
to squelch the rumors
about his bizarre personal life

379
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,245
and further his career.

380
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:25,462
(grumbles) You don't know
what you're talking about.

381
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,634
I have to go now
and see Troy.

382
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,883
(door opens, closes)

383
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,625
(tires screech)

384
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,774
Is this a sham marriage?

385
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,850
Sure, baby,
is that a problema?

386
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:45,265
You married me just
to help your career?

387
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,935
You make it sound so sordid.

388
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,404
Look, don't we have
a good time together?

389
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,114
Yes, but--

390
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,904
Don't you have everything
you ever wanted here--

391
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:55,197
money, security, a big,
hot, flat rock for Jub Jub?

392
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,912
But... don't you love me?

393
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:01,163
Sure, I do, like I love Fresca.

394
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,786
Isn't that enough?
The only difference

395
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,794
between our marriage
and anyone else's is,

396
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,746
we know ours is a sham.

397
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:08,876
Are you gay?

398
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,842
Gay? I wish.

399
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,014
If I were gay,
there'd be no problem.

400
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,973
No, what I have is
a romantic abnormality--

401
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,564
One so unbelievable
that it must be hidden

402
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,350
from the public at all costs.

403
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,893
-You see--
-Stop.

404
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,146
You're asking me to live a lie.

405
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,269
I don't know
if I can do that.

406
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,186
It's remarkably easy.

407
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:34,605
Just smile for the cameras
and enjoy Mr. Troy's Wild Ride.

408
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,616
You'll go to the right parties,
meet the right people.

409
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,828
Sure, you'll be a sham wife,
but you'll be the envy

410
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,080
of every other
sham wife in town.

411
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,252
So, what do you say, baby?

412
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:50,496
Tell me again
about Mr. Troy's Wild Ride.

413
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,508
One day my lady Selma's
going to have a star

414
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,847
right next to mine.

415
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:02,982
So, watch out,

416
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,978
Laszlo Panaflex.

417
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,940
Yay! Yay! Yay!

418
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,360
Tonight, all Hollywood's
wondering who'll be chosen

419
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,399
to co-star
in the big new McBain picture,

420
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,693
<i>McBain IV-- Fatal Discharge.</i>

421
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,357
(rings)

422
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,855
Oh, you watching?

423
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,277
Mac, you gotta
get me that part.

424
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,445
I will, but you got
to do something for me.

425
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,124
Problem is, the big parts these days
are all going to family men.

426
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,123
But I already
got married.

427
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,785
Yeah, but for a role like this,
you got to pour it on.

428
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:30,254
You and, uh, wife have
got to have a baby.

429
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,125
A baby, eh?
What do I do?

430
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,922
I'll send you over
a pamphlet.

431
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,046
Listen, you can't buy
that kind of P.R.

432
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,143
But you can get it for nothing
by having a baby,

433
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,138
which by the way,
your insurance will cover,

434
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,009
except for the deductible,

435
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,506
which I'll reimburse you for
if you get the part,

436
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,058
which you will,
if you have a baby.

437
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,681
C'est Troy bien.

438
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,147
Okay. Now listen.
Let's talk baby names.

439
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:51,268
You can't use Montana,
Dakota or Florida.

440
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,026
-They're taken.
-Mmm. Oregon?

441
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,859
Oh, Pacific Northwest,
very hot.

442
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,238
Having a child?

443
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,073
That's a big step.

444
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,368
You bet it is.
Think what it'll mean.

445
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,082
Not just the McBain movie,
but maybe my own fragrance--

446
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,583
Smellin' of Troy.

447
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:11,754
It is probably
my last chance to be a mommy.

448
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,665
-Cigarette, Mrs. McClure?
-You bet.

449
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,255
From now on,
she's smoking for two.

450
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,848
Ah, come here, Tiger.

451
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,772
(sexy growl)

452
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,941
Would you like some wine?

453
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,650
Yes.

454
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,567
(weak growl)

455
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,244
Uh, why don't you
come over here

456
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,333
and make yourself
more comfortable?

457
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,249
No. Why don't you
come over here

458
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,079
and make yourself
comfortable?

459
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,714
I'm sorry.

460
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,461
This whole concept's
foreign to me.

461
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,292
Who knew a baby
would be so much work?

462
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:58,088
Having a baby
isn't supposed to be work.

463
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,263
It's supposed to be
an expression of the feelings

464
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,052
we're supposed to have
for each other.

465
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:06,346
Oh, like how we built
that snowman together

466
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,981
in that Newport ad?

467
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:11,018
Remember how alive with pleasure
they said we were?

468
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,648
Look, I'm sorry.

469
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,776
A loveless marriage
is one thing.

470
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,413
We're not hurting anybody.

471
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,160
But bringing a child
into a loveless family

472
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,253
is something I just can't do.

473
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,458
Oh, great. We'll adopt.

474
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,119
I'll call my agent.

475
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,537
He'll find some kid
who wants in on the deal.

476
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,125
Good-bye, Troy.

477
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,590
I'll always remember you...

478
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,131
but not from your films.

479
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,135
Come on, Jub Jub.

480
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,805
Let's go home,

481
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,443
and I'll microwave you
some nice roaches.

482
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,151

483
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,568

488
