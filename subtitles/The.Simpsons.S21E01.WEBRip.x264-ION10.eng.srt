Yes. Let your imaginations
run free.

been a movie before,

105

-Extension cords.
-Mixed nuts.
-Car keys.

107
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,069
Eh, we’ve already
made everything

108
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,111
that could possibly be a movie
into a great movie.

109
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,315

the coolest comic book ever.

115

116
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,252
All of them.

117
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,467
That’s it.
Our next big summer movie
will be <i>Everyman.</i>

118
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,339
Uh, Marv? Ginormous Pictures
bought the rights

119
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,716
to <i>Everyman </i>three weeks ago.

120
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:45,932
Damn it!

121
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,768
We at Ginormous Pictures
are incredible fans

122
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,980
and think <i>Everyman </i>would
make a fantastic movie.

123
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,152
Oh really? The way
you thought "Stratego"
would make a good movie?

124
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,781
You’d expect us to believe

125
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,818
that a red scout
would date a blue general?

126
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,742
Gu... ffaw.

127
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,490
Hey, don’t blame us--
Brett Ratner had final cut.

128
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,833
I’m well aware
of who had what cut.

129
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,909

130
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,825
(slurping)

131
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,084
Let me get to the point:

132
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,495
It is not money I am after,

133
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,543
or women--
I know that is impossible.

134
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,337
What I want is to pick the
actor who will play Everyman.

135
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,762
No can do.

136
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,470
(sing-songy):
Thank you.

137
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,970
-But we never give...
-(sing-songy): Thank you.

138
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,143
They’ll laugh us
out of Hollywood.

139
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,261
I repeat--
(sing-songy): Thank you.

140
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,388
(heavy sigh)
Fine. You got it.

141
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,685
(normal voice):
Thank you.

142
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,609
(happy sigh) I played hardball
with Hollywood.

143
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,529
The closest I will ever come
to playing a sport in my life.

144
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,236
"Wherever there’s
a crime to be solved,

145
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,871
I will be there to solve...

146
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:48,949
...it."

147
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,703
And there’s more,

148
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,115
but my fax machine ran out
of ink, so I can’t read it.

149
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,914
Do you know where
you can buy ink

150
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,077
for an Amiga brand fax machine?

151
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,285
Thank you, that was great.

152
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,876
You want to see it
any other way?

153
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,131
Like sad...

154
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,382
or Brooklyn,
or Richard Nixon voice?

155
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,335
Pass.

156
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,875
But I already
bought a boat

157
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,548

were gonna pay me.

158

159
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,849

you’ve gotta pick someone.

160
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,733

leeches understand?

162
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,399

166
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,282

167
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,115

one amazing thing that
happened to them today.

175
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,056
Lisa?

176
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,981
Well, I qualified for
the National Math Bee--

177
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,940
Great. Marge, go.

178
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,270
Guess who the garden club

179
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,444
elected president?

180
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,402
You? Awesome. Next.

181
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,072
No. I lost.

182
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,570
Eh, they can go
to Hell. Bart?

183
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,451
Dr. Hibbert found out my thyroid
isn’t pumping out enough--

184
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,909
Time’s up. Okay, Maggie: "suck,
suck"-- that takes us to... me.

185
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,041
(humming fanfare)

186
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,079
Some Hollywood idiots hired
me to star in a movie.

187
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,674
No kidding?!
Whoa!

188
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,799
Homer, we have
a problem.

189
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,129
Fine. I’ll give back the Oscars
I stole from the lobby.

190
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,296
Do you want the Golden Globe?

191
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,513
(laughing):
No! No...

192
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,974
But we have a bigger problem.

193
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,814
Homer, my brother and I
showed this picture of you

194
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,770
to a cross-section
of typical moviegoers.

195
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,520
Not one thought you
looked like a superhero.

196
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,153
Several people
stared at the sun,

197
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,690
attempting to blind
themselves.

198
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,443
Stared at the sun.

199
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,485
Against every animal
instinct they had.

200
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,948
We need you to slim down, muscle
up and become the Everyman

201
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,990
people want to be instead
of the one they actually are.

202
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,365
I don’t know if I can.

203
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,621
I’m a yo-yo dieter:

204
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,252
"Yo, hot dog man.
Yo, peanuts."

205
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,670
(laughing)

206
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,998
Why aren’t you laughing?

207
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,293
Don’t you know
what "yo" means?

208
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,246
Maybe I can help.

209
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,166
Lyle McCarthy.

210
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,915
Finally, the answer
to my problem.

211
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,217
What do you do?

212
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,390
He’s the trainer
to the stars.

213
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,759
Here’s what Brad and Angelina
looked like before they met me.

214
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,467
HOMER:
Mm!

215
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,348
They look good with a
little meat on their bones.

216
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,984
Come with me.

217
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,191
Take my hand, Homer,

218
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,152
and wave goodbye
to fat you.

219
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,982
Goodbye, fat me.

220
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,027
You sure that guy who created
Everyman’s gonna like this?

221
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,072
Him? He’s gone Hollywood.

222
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,583
...a lot of people have come
to this town and changed,

223
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,581
but not me.

224
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,207
Now excuse me, I have
to read a story

225
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,541
to my adopted Cambodian orphan.

226
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:49,126
Nannies, produce
the child and the story.

227
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,633
Hello, Prius--
give Daddy a kiss.

228
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,643
Homer, do you
know why you eat?

229
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,853
Because I’m swallowing
my frustrations

230
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,933
and disappointments?

231
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,438
Something bad happens
and you cope

232
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,229
by cramming a donut
in your mouth.

233
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,573
Yeah, well, you don’t always
have time to (bleep).

234
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,028
I’m gonna teach you

235
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,528
healthy emotional
alternatives to eating.

236
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,241
We don’t have much time,

237
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,031
so we’ll do it in a montage to
the song "Eye of the Tiger."

238
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,235
("Eye of the Tiger" playing)

239
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,946
Oh, that song’s
a little on the nose.

240
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,036
Can we do it to
David Bowie’s "Heroes"?

241
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,331
Eh, it’s your montage.

242
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,964
("Heroes" playing)

243
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,800
Whew... This montage sounds
really exhausting.

244
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,302
-How about I just do a
walking around sad montage?
-No.

245
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,385
A montage of me turning
a ragtag Little League team

246
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,351
-into state runners-up?
-No.

247
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,471
Me using funny modes
of transportation

248
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,017
like a hot air balloon
and a camel,

249
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,730
and finally a pickup truck
full of chickens?

250
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,980
Then I get out of the truck
and go to thank the driver,

251
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,813
but then I see the
driver is a chicken?

252
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,228
Let’s just skip ahead a month.

253
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,316
{\an8}10,001... 10,002...

254
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,402
and... fit.

255
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,857
(phone ringing)

256
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,945
I gotta take this.

257
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,575
Tobey! <i>Cider House Rules!</i>

258
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,373
(whispers):
Total wuss.

259
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,496
Seabiscuit, you keeping
off the sugar cubes?

260
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,343
(whispers):
I <i>hate </i>this guy.

261
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,668
I love this guy!

262
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,463
Tobe, Tobe, Tobe,
we talked about this.

263
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,877
If the rice ain’t brown,
don’t chow down.

264
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,466
Look, I gotta bail--
I’m with Everyman right now.

265
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,102
No, no, no, no, no, don’t worry.

266
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,429
He totally sucks.

267
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,474
(whispers):
I’m only lying to him.

268
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,387
Good-bye!

269
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,685
(whispers):
Bad-bye.

270
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,518
Was that Tobey Maguire?

271
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,813
Hey, Home Town Buffet,
like I told John Travolta,

272
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,607
my client list
is private.

273
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,441
You know what?
You know what?
Enough chitchat.

274
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,896
Hit the pole!

275
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,485
Stripper up...

276
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,860
fireman down.

277
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,027
And sexy.

278
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,315
Heroic!

279
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,658
Sexy.

280
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,702
Heroic!

281
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:43,985
And sexy.

282
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,368
Heroic!

283
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,084
Earn that money.

284
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,955
Found this
on the roof.

285
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,922
Well, I think we’ve seen
the last of the Purple Pariah.

286
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,423
Thanks, Everyman.

287
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,545
Don’t thank <i>me.</i>

288
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,721
Thank Captain America

289
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,509
for giving me the patriotism

290
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,512
to <i>want </i>to save
the president’s life.

291
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,144
And thank Wonder Woman

292
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,731
for giving me the boobs
to distract the guards.

293
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,678
And... cut.

294
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,137
What’d you think, kids?

295
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,647
That was awesome!

296
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,809
Although there were
a few holes in the story.

297
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,857
That’s the problem when
you have 17 writers.

298
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,611
But don’t worry, we have
two fresh ones working on it.

299
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:25,577
Ooh, Homie, take
your shirt off again.

300
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,581
Oh! There’s less
of you to love,

301
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,544
but I love you even more!

302
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,415
Aah! What was that?

303
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,802
Your other hand.

304
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,379
(chuckles)

305
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,014
Oh...

306
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,095
(gunfire)

307
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,808
(explosion)

308
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,897
(explosion)

309
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,271
Cut! Terrific.

310
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,937
Bring in
the next helicopter.

311
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,820
Awesome performance,
Homer.

312
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,315
I smell Oscar.

313
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,406
Oscar, take a shower,
or a tomato bath or something.

314
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,953
Please!

315
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:10,036
This life is the greatest--
I get paid a fortune,

316
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,962
I’ve got a closet full
of free sneakers and watches,

317
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,962
and I get to hire
my friends.

318
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,014
At least you get to see
my face-- unlike Carl.

319
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,548
I’m being paid
to do what I love!

320
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,684
(chuckles)

321
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,220
A lot of things
come and go in life,

322
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,644
but not fame and fitness.

323
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,983
Homer! Homer Sapian, can
I have a word with you?

324
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,480
I know this is a bad time, but
I’m leaving for another gig.

325
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:39,653
Is that all this temporary
job was to you, a <i>gig?</i>

326
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,815
Don’t take it
personally, Home Team.

327
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,034
But how will I keep
from overeating?

328
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,584
Just remember
what I taught you.

329
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,289
But you taught me
the only people
who can stay thin

330
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,960
are those who can
afford $5,000-a-week
nutritional consultants!

331
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,500
(quietly):
I’ve taught you well.

332
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,883
Goodbye.

333
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,508
(fierce yell)

334
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,734
He’s gone.

335
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,309
One cheese cube couldn’t hurt.

336
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,356
Ooh! This other cheese cube
stuck to the first one.

337
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,533
Well, that still
technically counts as one.

338
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,909
Mm, it’s bad luck to eat an
uneven number of cheese cubes.

339
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,537
(chomping, gulping)

340
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,458
(chomping, gulping)

341
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,540
(chomping, gulping
continues)

342
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,134
(sobbing):
Don’t look at me!

343
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,384
(chomping)

344
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,085
Don’t look at me!

345
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,425
You, you watch.

346
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,430
(chomping)

347
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,194
Avery, I swear, you’re the
only man in Gothamopolis

348
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,349
who’s never seen Everyman.

349
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,018
Well, one thing’s
for sure:

350
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,897
<i>I’m </i>not Everyman.

351
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,820
-(snap)
-Cut!

352
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,067
(quietly):
This is a disaster.

353
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,948
I’m getting a bad
feeling about this film.

354
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,825
The star’s overweight,
we’re way over budget,

355
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,002
and the grasshopperaptor
we built

356
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,290
seems to have developed
an evil mind of its own.

357
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,127
(humming cheerfully)

358
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,297
(curious grunts)

359
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:34,181
Oh, Marge, I’m ready
for some lovin’.

360
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,346
Come and get me!

361
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,645
(pop)

362
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,648
(yells)

363
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,902
(groans):
Oh...

364
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,321
Marge! Speak to me!

365
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,069
I think you may have
put on a little weight.

366
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,952
Nag, nag, nag!

367
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,119
Apu, I have
to lose weight now.

368
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,869
Do you have anything
that’ll make me vomit?

369
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,291
Well, I don’t know,

370
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,619
I... might have some milk
that has expired.

371
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,580
Ah, here we are.

372
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,337
A delightful
buttermilk from 1961.

373
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,419
(blows)

374
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,384
Oh, ’61-- everyone was

375
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,184
twisting again like they
did the previous summer.

376
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,599
Whatever you do,
do not chew the chunks.

377
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,233
Uh-oh.

378
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,439
Oh, boy.

379
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,099
Cleanup in aisles in three,

380
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,857
two, one...

381
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,565
And... action!

382
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,652
(groaning)

383
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,817
Ugh. What?

384
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:30,905
Cut.

385
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,700
-Where’s Homer?
-In his trailer.

386
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,043
-He won’t come out?
-He <i>can’t </i>come out.

387
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,582
Ugh!

388
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,205
This film is an embarrassment
of Jar-Jarrian magnitude!

389
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:47,513
As the writer, I demand
to express my opinion.

390
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,429
Ooh, I’m afraid that’s
not gonna happen.

391
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,798
I see.
Well, I respect that...

392
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,465
and Vulcan death
grip! (grunts)

393
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,715
Hollywood ponytail yank!

394
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,725
(wailing, shuddering)

395
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,230
My only sin was believing
in George Clooney!

396
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,733
(wailing)

397
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,950
(humming happily)

398
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,203
How you doing, man?

399
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,286
Ooh, I think we have
a clunker here.

400
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,792
And I should know-- I
produced <i>Bad Summer Movie,</i>

401
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,455
the parody of bad summer
movies that was itself
a bad summer movie.

402
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,415
Don’t worry, we fixed
everything with editing.

403
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,505
Editing solves everything--
except my problems with the IRS.

404
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,342
Yeah, how’s that going?

405
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,024
(deep, gruff voice):
Everyman...

406
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,476
(hisses):
show your-ssself.

407
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,737
I’m right here.

408
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,199
I’ve been here all along.

409
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,589
(puzzled grunt)

410
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,669
Half the shots he’s fat,
half the shots he’s thin--

411
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,338
it’s taking me
out of the moment.

412
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,846
Like when you’re kissing
a girl, and she burps.

413
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,429
Who was in charge
of continuity on this picture?

414
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,675
I tried to show them the
Polaroids-- they wouldn’t look.

415
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,848
It’s your job to get
their attention.

416
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,897
Nobody takes
responsibility anymore.

417
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,440
Well, I-I just wanted
to get back into the business

418
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,275
after I had my kids.

419
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,110
Yeah, well, now those kids have
an embarrassment for a mother.

420
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,824
Home Boy.

421
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,867
What happened, dude?

422
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,701
You went from Everyman
to Everywhereman.

423
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,747
What happened is, you left!

424
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,581
Who did you
leave me for?

425
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,036
Tell me--
I can take it.

426
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,087
(sobbing)

427
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,170
Okay! It was Turtle
from <i>Entourage.</i>

428
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,337
I knew it!

429
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,014
(wailing sobs)

430
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,434
Come on, Home Run.

431
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,762
It’s okay, Home Alone.

432
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,557
Look, I’m sorry.

433
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,390
Let me make this up to
you-- I’ll train you,

434
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:08,476
then leave you again,
<i>then </i>come back and train you.

435
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,574
It’s how I make my money.

436
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,649
Just you and me?

437
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,244
You, me and Turtle.

438
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,700
That could work.

439
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,780
He is a great guy.

440
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,776
(whispers):
He’s an <i>awful </i>guy.

441
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,158
You just said both
those things to <i>me.</i>

442
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,365
I’m sorry.

443
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,174
(whispers):
I’m not sorry.

444
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,418
Look, Comic Book Guy,
about the movie,

445
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,961
we know it’s not great.

446
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:34,174
Yeah, the projectionist
hung himself at the final reel.

447
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,586
But you created Everyman--
your fans will think
whatever you tell ’em.

448
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,046
If you put the word out
that this movie is good,

449
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,387
we’ll let you direct the sequel.

450
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,851
You would let me direct

451
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,431
<i>Everyman 2:</i>
<i>Rise of the Revenge?</i>

452
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,847
Absolutely!
All you have to do

453
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:51,396
is tell your army of Internet
dweebs to go see this movie.

454
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,691
Hmm, sell my soul
for Hollywood lucre,

455
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,026
or stay true to my lofty ideals.

456
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,032
<i>Everyman, </i>the motion picture,

457
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,164
is the combination
of a life-long dream,

458
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,241
and I was one of the few

459
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,827
who saw that dream realized
on screen last night.

460
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,793
If there is one fault to find

461
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,003
with this
$200 million production,

462
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,963
it is that this is the worst

463
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,795
movie ever!

464
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,470
And send!

465
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,798
And sip.

466
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,383
(slurping)

467
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,508
<i>ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i>Though legislation was passed</i>

468
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:25,055
<i>to ensure </i>Everyman <i>was</i>
