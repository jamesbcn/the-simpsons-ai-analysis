fanny cast for quite some time.

{\an8}Now, son, this is
a teaching hospital

65
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,010
{\an8}which is why I equipped
the seat of your cast

66
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,262
{\an8}with a viewing window.

00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,604

00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:41,798

SKINNER: Bart,
stop fooling around.

72
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,612
Principal Skinner,
I thought public schools

73
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,612
were required to have
access ramps for the disabled.

74
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:01,235
Technically, yes, but the building costs
would be astronomical.

75
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,704
Did I hear the world
"astronomical"?

76
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,905
If so, my construction outfit,

77
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,865
Valdazzo Brothers Olive Oil,
is poised to help.

78
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,667
No, no, no, no.
We're not building anything.

79
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,000
How can you say that

80
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,085
when construction
has already begun?

81
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,420
-(tires screech)
-(power drill clattering)

82
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,166
How did those trucks
get here so fast?

83
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,008
In order to avoid certain
"legal complications,"

84
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,974
the trucks are always rolling.

85
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,724
Now for
the groundbreaking ceremony.

86
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,846
(shutter clicks)

87
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,151
Good lord, do we really need
all those ramps?

88
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,559
Who's to say?

89
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,687
Does a peacock need
all those feathers?

90
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,654
Look, you're getting
a little philosophical for me.

91
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,704
I suppose so. They say
it happens in the autumn years.

92
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,859
Be that as it may...

93
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,117
Get your hand off my car.

94
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,410
This is a proud day.

95
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,584
Now when people ask
if we're in compliance

96
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,373
with the Americans
with Disabilities Act of 1975,

97
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,787
I can say we are closer
than ever before!

98
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,627
(all cheering)

99
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,223
Thank you.
To inaugurate our ramp system,

100
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,799
here's the first of what I hope

101
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:04,183
will be many disabled students,
Bart Simpson.

102
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,272
-I'm proud of you, boy.
-What the...

103
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,768
-Bart, where's your wheelchair?
-Don't need it any more.

104
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,021
Doctor says my butt bone's
stronger than ever.

105
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,653
(grunting)
Ta-da!

106
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,981
-(weak applause)
-MAN: That's interesting.

107
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,607
Well, at least we're prepared
for the new millennium.

108
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,791
By God, the whole thing's
made of bread sticks!

109
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,159
And paint and shellac.

110
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,075
It's all itemized in this bill.

111
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,916
$200,000? Are you mad?

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,050
I don't get mad. I get stabby.

113
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,223
The good news
is we need no longer fear

114
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,930
vicious mob reprisals.

115
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,010
(honking horn)

116
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,848
But due to lack of funds,

117
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,814
Springfield Elementary
is closed forever.

118
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,936
ALL: Yay!

119
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,113
Oh, you're cheering now,
but someday you'll--

120
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,862
ALL: Yay!

121
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,113
I'm just going to stop trying.

122
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,815
ALL: Yay!

123
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,659
-How could you close the school?
-What will become of our kids?

124
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,996
-Where are the refreshments?
-Now, you keep asking me that

125
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,752
and I keep telling you
"over there."

126
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,384
(clears throat) As for the school,
we're exploring various options

127
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,923
to raise the $200,000 we need.

128
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,507
I've got a motor home
I never use.

129
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,722
Maybe we should raffle it off.

130
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,102
Maybe you should shut up.

131
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,258
Well, I... OK.

132
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,887
We could try selling liquor.

133
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,143
I'm doing great.

134
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,555
Please, sir, put some shoes on.

135
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,154
What? You don't like my bags?

136
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,269
People, these are
all good ideas.

137
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,436
No, they're not. They're
terrible, terrible ideas.

138
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,358
You're right. It's hopeless.

139
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,744
No one has that kind of money.

140
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,991
What about Mr. Burns?

141
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,662
Maybe he'll help us out.

142
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,240
Forget it.
He releases the hounds

143
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,235
on every charity
that comes to his door...

144
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,117
Feed The Children,
Save The Whales,

145
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,504
even Release The Hounds.

146
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,130
Well, maybe we can
pry open his wallet

147
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,458
with a slick, professional pitch.
(snaps fingers)

148
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,594
A school play!

149
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,545
Welcome to
the world premiere of...

150
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,804
<i>The Nice Man Giveth.</i>

151
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,096
Oh, focus!

152
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,219
It's a play, sir.

153
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:16,227
Hmm, which one of these
is the salt?

154
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,980
Too bad I'm an idiot
'cause my school closed.

155
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,523
Oh, well.

156
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,186
No, that's the rat poison!

157
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,744
And freeze!

158
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:28,029
Now, who in Springfield
will eat the poisoned broth?

159
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,954
Oh, it could be anyone,

160
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,742
even Mr. Burns.

161
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,826
This play really speaks to me.

162
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,083
{\an8}(mimicking siren)

163
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,325
{\an8}I can't take Mr. Burns
to the (lisping) hotpital

164
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,377
{\an8}'cause I'm too dumb
to read a map.

165
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,091
{\an8}Oh, why did my school
have to close?

166
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,422
Hmm.

167
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,799
Hello, I'm Dr. Stupid.

168
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,966
I'm going to take out
your liver bones.

169
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,894
(grunts)
Oops, you're dead.

170
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,733
{\an8}I never liked that Dr. Stupid.

171
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,060
Mr. Burns, I'll be honest.
We had a hidden agenda tonight.

172
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,357
-(gasps) No!
-The holiday season is approaching,

173
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,491
and these children
need a school.

174
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:09,068
Charity, eh?
Yes, I'd be more than happy...

175
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,365
(all screaming)

176
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,330
Oh, it's doing
that thing again.

177
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,157
ANNOUNCER: <i>We now return to</i>

178
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,575
(speaking in Spanish)

179
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,518
(groans)
Daytime TV is <i>muy estupido.</i>

180
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,848
-(static crackles)
-Hey, our school's on TV.

181
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,814
{\an8}<i>Springfield Elementary</i>
<i>has reopened its doors.</i>

182
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,185
(both gasp)

183
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,231
I'm with Jim Hope

184
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,864
of Kid First Industries

185
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,231
which has generously stepped in

186
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,737
to educate our children.

187
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,028
That's right, Kent. You know,

188
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,571
when public schools
drop the ball,

189
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,735
it's up to the private sector

190
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:52,912
to fall on that fumble

191
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,160
and run for the end zone.

192
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,452
Will you be replacing

193
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,035
the current teachers
and administrators?

194
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,209
Very much so, Kent.
But they've already received

195
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,118
an extremely generous
severance package.

196
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,667
"Valencia?"

197
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,170
(scoffs)
These are juice oranges!

198
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,508
Howdy, children. I'd like
to welcome you back to school!

199
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,839
-ALL: Boo!
-You know what? I agree.

200
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,835
-ALL: Wha...
-Your old school was boring.

201
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,757
That's why it failed, right?
Well, we're not going

202
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,635
to make you memorize
facts and dates.

203
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,812
No, no, no.

204
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,850
I'm going to find out

205
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,143
what you really love in life

206
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,976
and teach to that.

207
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,771
What are you
passionate about, partner?

208
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,524
-Boogers.
-(all laughing)

209
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,487
"Boogers"! (laughs)
That was great!

210
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,949
You know, humor is
a sign of intelligence.

211
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,199
-You're not mad?
-Hey, I'm here to make sure

212
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,532
that you get a kick
out of education.

213
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,907
Hyah!

214
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,254
STUDENTS: Yay!

215
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,828
He's rekindled my love affair

216
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,913
with books.

217
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,538
(Bart grunting)

218
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,674
Check it out. I'm breaking books
at a sixth-grade level.

219
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,965
-(grunts)
-Get 'em, boy!

220
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,468
Hit those smart-ass books!

221
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,390
Why don't you kick
some books, Lisa?

222
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,678
Bart broke all my books.

223
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,562
You know what our homework is?

224
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,139
Find a toy
and bring it to class.

225
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,774
Boy, that sounds fun.

226
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,811
I know, but I'm still
not going to do it.

227
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,186
Since Christmas is coming soon,

228
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,733
I thought we could talk
about our favorite toys.

229
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,567
Milhouse,
what have you got there?

230
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,952
My busy box.

231
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,239
It's got everything.

232
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,742
Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!

233
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,414
I'm calling Daddy.

234
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,872
Good for you.
Not being bound

235
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,662
by the recommended age.

236
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,156
What are you talking about?

237
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,495
Oh, jeez!

238
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,880
How about the rest of you?

239
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,590
What do you like
about those toys of yours?

240
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,800
They're special.

241
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,130
They're challenging.

242
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,474
(music playing backward)

243
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,309
Very good.

244
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,849
Now I want you all
to imagine the perfect toy.

245
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,653
-What would it be like?
-It should be soft and cuddly.

246
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,308
Yeah, with lots of firepower.

247
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,856
Its eyes should be telescopes.

248
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,229
No, periscopes.

249
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,816
No, microscopes!

250
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,901
Can you come back to me?

251
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,985
It should be full of surprises.

252
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,611
It should never stop dancing.

253
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,067
It should need accessories.

254
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,657
Now that's market research

255
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,162
you can take to the bank.

256
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,413
The money bank.

257
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,905
I just wish
those second graders

258
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,326
would stop jerking us around.

259
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,463
-Fun toys are fun.
-Well said, Ralph.

260
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,884
But we're trying to come up
with a name for a toy.

261
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,593
-Mrs. Fun?
-Not bad.

262
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,634
Fun?

263
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,926
Ralph, there are no right
or wrong answers,

264
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,050
but if you don't pipe down,
I'm giving you an "F."

265
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,057
The before teacher
yelled at me, too.

266
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,389
No one's yelling.

267
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,434
We're just brainstorming names.

268
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,558
Lisa, any ideas?

269
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,654
Oh, a name with fun?

270
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,059
Um, fungus?

271
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,317
Funzo? Attila the fun?

272
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,730
Lisa, are you doing math?

273
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,948
Uh, just a few Venn diagrams.

274
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,858
There's more under her chair.

275
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:40,744
(chuckles)

276
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,735
Lisa in trouble.

277
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,866
Ha, the ironing is delicious.

278
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,373
-The word is "irony."
-Huh?

279
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,615
Don't you think there's
something weird going on here?

280
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,998
We spend all day
selecting fabric swatches,

281
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:54,205
and then our guest speaker
was Phil from marketing.

282
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,966
Alls I know is I'm getting
straight As

283
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,089
and that ain't not bad.

284
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,296
(laughs)

285
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,966
That's not funny!

286
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,724
Huh? Oh.

287
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,599
(gasps)

288
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,858
They're spying on us.

289
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,527
Why would they do that?

290
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,825
-ROBOTIC VOICE: I see you.
-(gasps)

291
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,328
Give me a hug.

292
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,714
{\an8}(screams)

293
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,511
This better be important, Lisa.

294
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,471
I left Ralphie alone
in the bathtub.

295
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,261
RALPH (on radio): <i>Daddy,</i>
<i>I'm ready to get out now.</i>

296
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,354
<i>Over.</i>

297
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,394
This broom closet
is not what it seems.

298
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:51,395
It's a secret surveillance room
guarded by a tiny evil robot.

299
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,269
Ugh. Is this going to be like
one of those horror movies

300
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,476
where we open the door
and everything's normal

301
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,937
and we think you're crazy

302
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,947
but then there really is
a killer robot

303
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,199
and the next morning you find
me impaled on a weathervane?

304
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,992
{\an8}Is that what this is, Lisa?

305
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:08,115
To be fair, not all
evil robots are killers.

306
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,544
Listen, when you see
what's inside this...

307
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,673
(gasps)

308
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,246
I don't understand. I could
swear it was right here.

309
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,666
Yeah, right, mop top.
And I'm Ed Sullivan.

310
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,915
(imitating Ed Sullivan)
Really big shew...

311
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,587
No, no, I can do it better.

312
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,255
Really big shew, really big.
That's it.

313
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,261
Well, folks, that's
the end of Krusty's

314
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,018
nondenominational
holiday fun fest.

315
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,640
I want to thank my guests

316
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:32,977
Tea Leoni...

317
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,102
Beck...

318
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,479
The Dixie Chicks...

319
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,275
ALL: Merry Christmas, y'all.

320
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,819
KRUSTY: ...and Patrick Ewing
as the genie.

321
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:46,534
So have a merry Christmas,
happy Hanukkah, kwazy Kwanza,

322
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:51,117
a tip-top Tet, and a solemn,
dignified Ramadan.

323
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,705
Now a word from my God,
our sponsor.

324
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,547
ROBOTIC VOICE (singsongy):
I see you.

325
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,762
Give me a hug.

326
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,553
Hah! That's the doll
that attacked me.

327
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,926
TV ANNOUNCER: <i>This Christmas,</i>
<i>everybody wants Funzo.</i>

328
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,894
Funzo? I said
that name in class.

329
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,056
Funzo's soft and cuddly.

330
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,694
With lots of firepower.

331
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,361
-Aah! Ow
-Yes!

332
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,570
(imitating Nelson)
Haw haw!

333
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,690
ANNOUNCER: <i>Funzo!</i>

334
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,146
<i>Funzo! Funzo!</i>

335
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,816
<i>If you don't have Funzo,</i>

336
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,494
<i>you're nothing.</i>

337
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,453
Mom, I know what
I want for Christmas.

338
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,953
Bart, they lied to us.

339
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,494
Instead of giving us
an education,

340
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,868
they tricked us
into designing a toy.

341
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,285
Aren't you outraged?

342
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,173
No, but if you're going
to throw a spaz,

343
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,460
-I'll come with.
-Good.

344
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,173
Saddle up the bikes.

345
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,221
Get down. Security guard.

346
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,681
Hey, it's Gary Coleman.

347
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,394
But the menu said
"galaxy of prawns."

348
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,015
Three prawns
are hardly a galaxy.

349
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,569
What do you mean your hands are tied?
Let me talk to Mr. Kwan.

350
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,228
I want to see
how this turns out.

351
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,487
The phone's
not even plugged in.

352
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,569
All right, you listen
to me, Kwan...

353
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,744
Hang on, I got another call.

354
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,743
Yes, Mr. President. I can be
in Washington right away.

355
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,000
You people took advantage
of trusting school children.

356
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,673
How did you get past
Gary Coleman?

357
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,802
Let's just say he's
a few prawns short of a galaxy.

358
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,300
(shouting)

359
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:29,303
I'm sorry, Gary. There's
no longer a place for you here.

360
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,096
Whatchu talkin' about,
Miss Naegle?

361
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,850
That is so adorable.

362
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,482
You're rehired.

363
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,848
Sucker. I knew exactly
what she was talking about.

364
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,230
(snoring)

365
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,067
Lisa, I know you're mad,
but just for a damn minute

366
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,993
try to see this from a product
positioning standpoint.

367
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,123
Do you have any idea
how much pressure we're under

368
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,790
to come up with the new Furby
or Tickle Me Elmo?

369
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:57,289
And thanks to you, Funzo is the first doll
designed by children

370
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,923
for children, with all
the profits going to children.

371
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,090
Really?

372
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,338
Yeah, well, we're all
somebody's children.

373
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,800
But, hey, we did screw you a little.
So, here's a free Funzo.

374
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,592
-Deal.
-Oh, brother.

375
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,847
And I want
Funzo's Dream Fortress,

376
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,520
Funzo's Lower Back Pain Chair,

377
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,599
Funzo's European
Voltage Converter...

378
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,555
Why not get three?

379
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,015
Ah, three, it is.

380
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,105
(snaps)

381
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,978
(whirring)

382
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,817
Thanks, Funzo. You rock.

383
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,242
All righty.

384
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,866
It's always a party with Funzo.

385
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,540
I admit it's kind of cute,

386
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,328
but it'll never take
the place of Malibu Stacy.

387
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,035
(gasps)
Did you see that?

388
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,008
Yeah. Funzo makes playtime fun.

389
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,795
Hey, kids, it's...
(gagging)

390
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,014
Hey, why is it destroying
other toys?

391
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,675
They must have programmed it
to eliminate the competition.

392
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,894
-You mean like Microsoft?
-Exactly.

393
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,305
Come on, Bart, we've got
to warn everyone.

394
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,654
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

395
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,862
Boycott Funzo!

396
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,574
He's a toy-killing machine!

397
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,445
(chuckles)
That shy little imp?

398
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,750
-I have a flower for 'oo.
-ALL: Aww...

399
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,328
Oh, man, I got
to get me one of those.

400
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,423
Hey, I'm not waiting
till the store opens.

401
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,036
-(all shouting)
-WOMAN: Get out of the way!

402
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:28,296
Wow. Only 22 seconds
from muttering to door smash.

403
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,420
That projects to a profit of...

404
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,217
$370 million.

405
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,931
I'd still sleep a little easier
if I saw some trampling.

406
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,562
Ow! Ow! Ow! Hey! Ow!

407
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,479
Now, why would you wear cleats
to a store?

408
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,848
(glasses clink)

409
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,564
Well, I guess that's it.

410
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,614
Come Christmas eve,
there'll be a Funzo

411
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,318
under every tree.

412
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,978
Unless...

413
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,447
-So, who am I beating up?
-Nobody.

414
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,529
You're just going to break
into everyone's house

415
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,115
and steal their favorite toy.

416
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,790
Thus saving Christmas.

417
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,198
Now, let's see, this will make
three Christmases

418
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:04,287
I saved versus eight I ruined.
Two were kind of a draw...

419
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,384
Dad, Dad, you're driving
on the sidewalk.

420
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,750
-Sorry.
-(cat yowls)

421
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,586

00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,515
Yes. The madness ends here.

440
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,229
Huh! If I had a nickel
for every time I've heard that.

441
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,018
(grunting)

442
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,486
I'm very mad at 'oo.

443
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,649
(groans)

444
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,616
(all gasping)

445
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,077
Well, what do we have here?

446
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,253
Looks like the biggest rip-off
since <i>Webster.</i>

447
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,381
(yelps) Please, Mr. Coleman,
we can explain.

448
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,129
I'm listening.

449
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,841
Your toy company is evil.

450
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,461
Well, isn't it possible

451
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,548
for an evil company
to make people happy?

452
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,343
Are you saying the end
justifies the means?

453
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,638
That's a very glib
interpretation.

454
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,682
Hey, don't talk
to my sister that way.

455
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,175
No, Bart, he's right.

456
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,977
I did oversimplify.

457
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,310
Perhaps, but let's not get
bogged down in semantics.

458
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,397
I think what Lisa meant
to say is...

459
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,782
NARRATOR: <i>And so</i>
<i>Gary Coleman and the Simpsons</i>

460
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,491
<i>argued long into the night...</i>

461
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,122
<i>and then, as day broke</i>

462
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,290
<i>the spirit of the season</i>
<i>entered their hearts.</i>

463
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,209
Let's just agree that the
commercialization of Christmas

464
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,039
is at best a mixed blessing.

465
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,714
-Amen.
-ALL: Yeah, amen. Amen. Amen.

466
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,554
Love!

467
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,720
Hey, look out!
(shouting)

468
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,019
Well, there's something
you don't see every Christmas.

469
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,808
Hey, it is Christmas.

470
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,062
We'd better get home.

471
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,483
{\an8}Hey, Dad,
what do you think of...

472
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,145
(whispering indistinctly)

473
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,158
Um, uh, Mr. Coleman,
I've been thinking,

474
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,490
uh, my wife always makes
too much stuffing

475
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,866
and sweet p'taters
and all, and...

476
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,334
Oh, heck.

477
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,713
Would you like to spend
Christmas with us?

478
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:54,211
No way. I'm having Christmas
at George Clooney's house.

479
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,585
Gary.

480
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,052
All right, I'll come.

481
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,338
NARRATOR: <i>And Gary Coleman</i>
<i>was as good as his word.</i>

482
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,467
<i>As for old Mr. Burns,</i>
<i>he was visited by three ghosts</i>

483
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,305
<i>during the night and agreed</i>
<i>to fund the school</i>

484
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,232
<i>with some money he found</i>
<i>in his tuxedo pants...</i>

485
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,521
Thank you, thank you. Humbug.

486
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,525
NARRATOR: <i>...while Moe, seeing</i>
<i>what the world would be like</i>

487
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,398
<i>if he had never been born</i>

488
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,145
<i>pulled his head</i>
<i>out of the oven</i>

489
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,617
<i>ad replaced it with</i>

490
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,949
Here, happy holidays there.

491
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,204
ALL: Merry Christmas, Moe.

492
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,617
Uh, listen, I kind of banged up
the jeep in the driveway.

493
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,287
Whatchu talkin' about, Moe?

494
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,495
(all laughing)

495
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,415
{\an8}Whatchu talkin' 'bout,
everyone.

496
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,429

497
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,680
