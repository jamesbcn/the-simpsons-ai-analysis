So, Kent, that
mistake you made,

175
00:09:45,656 --> 00:09:49,426
that fundamental, life-changing
error, that cosmic fail, that...

176
00:09:49,453 --> 00:09:51,888
- Just tell me already!
- After this break.

177
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,379
You could have come with me,

178
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:58,038
but you were suckling the dual teats
of infotainment and celebrifawning.

179
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,000
(upbeat theme plays)

180
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:02,335
So, tell us about
your new movie.

181
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,708
It's fantastic.

182
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:06,697
The studio let us play
in their sandbox.

183
00:10:06,754 --> 00:10:09,337
- Great. We have a clip.
- No! No, don't show it.

184
00:10:09,362 --> 00:10:11,795
There aren't five good
seconds in the whole film.

185
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:13,328
(car door closes,
tires screeching)

186
00:10:14,754 --> 00:10:17,559
I'm not a newsman anymore,
I'm a geologist.

187
00:10:17,627 --> 00:10:19,740
I keep discovering
a new rock bottom.

188
00:10:19,763 --> 00:10:22,517
Kent, I think I found my
ticket out of this town.

189
00:10:22,547 --> 00:10:24,681
Or at least to a
<i>better</i> Springfield.

190
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:27,316
You two newshounds
working on a story?

191
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:28,454
How about this?

192
00:10:28,476 --> 00:10:32,057
Mario's down the street
found a rat in their pasta.

193
00:10:32,075 --> 00:10:35,517
- When did that happen?
- Whenever you want. Eh?

194
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:37,858
Rachel, can I come?
We can share blazers.

195
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:39,330
Just follow me.

196
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,982
At Mario's, the picture of Sinatra on
the wall is signed by Frank Junior.

197
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:46,141
The frame hides the "Junior"!

198
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:49,656
Someone's been dumping
tires in the forest.

199
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:54,500
Willikers! In my three years of soft news,
I've never seen anything like this.

200
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:58,055
Those are tires from my
ill-fated Krusty Town Car.

201
00:10:58,072 --> 00:11:01,316
It would <i>explode</i> if people
gripped the wheel too tightly.

202
00:11:01,358 --> 00:11:02,664
(laughs):
What a scoop!

203
00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:04,439
You're not telling no one.

204
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:09,813
As the 4:00 p.m. clown, I have complete
control of the Channel 6 news division.

205
00:11:11,152 --> 00:11:13,065
Local news is a joke.

206
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:14,793
I'm going to cable.

207
00:11:14,936 --> 00:11:16,261
Cable news!

208
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:18,952
Bah! People only want news
at 6:00 p.m.

209
00:11:18,962 --> 00:11:22,490
from white guys on weekdays
and black guys on weekends.

210
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,610
We'll see about that.
Yes, we shall see.

211
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:27,933
About that, things will be seen.

212
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:29,616
By us.

213
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,532
Kent, you coming?

214
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:33,721
He ain't comin'.

215
00:11:33,744 --> 00:11:38,068
This little piggy's afraid to leave
his cushy anchorman slop trough.

216
00:11:38,096 --> 00:11:40,457
Could you, uh, phrase that
a little more nicely?

217
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:43,214
Sorry. He "isn't" coming.

218
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,829
You'll regret this, Kent.

219
00:11:44,847 --> 00:11:47,227

220
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:50,153
tracking Santa's flight
from the North Pole.

221
00:11:50,165 --> 00:11:52,166
"Oh, look, he's over Greenland!"

222
00:11:56,136 --> 00:11:59,083
Don't worry, piggy, you
made the right choice.

223
00:12:01,282 --> 00:12:04,591
Eh, it'll burn out
in an hour or so.

224
00:12:12,446 --> 00:12:14,691
Look, Burns, I've got the dope
on your sweetie.

225
00:12:14,721 --> 00:12:18,446
She's still alive, and she just got
over being mad at you last week.

226
00:12:18,481 --> 00:12:19,781
Lilah's alive?

227
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:23,272
Yeah, well, uh, she's
alive, <i>but</i> she's a nun.

228
00:12:23,306 --> 00:12:25,687
Married to Jesus, eh?
Does he beat her?

229
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:28,332
Jesus? No, he's a real
Eagle Scout, that one.

230
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:31,153
But your penguin's not a Catholic,
she's a Buddhist nun...

231
00:12:31,171 --> 00:12:34,543
spent her life expressing her
sexuality with a Zen garden.

232

doing to save our son?

331
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:44,233
Well, I've placed marksmen on the roof
to shoot the balloons one by one,

332
00:17:44,245 --> 00:17:46,149

not very good.

spread out. Arm's length.

respect, that's ridiculous.

339

and Churchill speeches

he can't even open a refrigerator.

343
00:18:11,274 --> 00:18:13,671
Hey! Only <i>I</i> get to
criticize him, Lou.

344
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:16,043
Kid's scared to flush.
Think's it's his brother.

345
00:18:16,074 --> 00:18:19,302
Can we focus on my
son up in the sky?

346
00:18:19,322 --> 00:18:21,460
Oh, I've got a long-shot idea.

347
00:18:21,478 --> 00:18:24,907
By which I mean firing a
shot over a long distance.

348
00:18:24,952 --> 00:18:26,686
(chuckling)

349
00:18:26,812 --> 00:18:32,461
Yeah, you see, if we could fire an exactly
12-and-a-half-pound weight into the basket,

350
00:18:32,482 --> 00:18:35,751
it would lower the boy
very gently to the ground.

351
00:18:35,778 --> 00:18:39,448
Unfortunately, all our
cannonballs were melted down

352
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:41,992
to make a statue of Joe Paterno,

353
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:44,995
which we changed to
look like Eugene Levy.

354
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:49,873
I think I just might have
what you're looking for.

355
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:53,704
♪

356
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:57,341
Today I'm <i>glad</i> that
I sold that stock.

357
00:18:57,358 --> 00:19:00,112
Uh, Apple closed up
another 20 points today.

358
00:19:00,144 --> 00:19:02,126
(whining):
Why does everyone know?

359
00:19:02,143 --> 00:19:04,841
Because their terrific products
keep track of it for you.

360
00:19:04,884 --> 00:19:07,184
And anything else you
could ever think of.

361
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,794
That kid's not
dying on <i>my</i> watch.

362
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:18,439
Which ends... right
now, fortunately.

363
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,715
(hums a tune)

364
00:19:21,937 --> 00:19:24,248
(whimpers)

365
00:19:24,604 --> 00:19:27,617
CROWD (chanting): Bart! Bart!
Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart!

366
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:29,159
(laughing):
Hey.

367
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:31,369
- Hmm. (yells)
- CROWD: Bart! Bart!

368
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,757
Homer's rising faster
than Apple stock.

369
00:19:33,787 --> 00:19:35,000
(laughter)

370
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:36,569
(Homer yells, grunts)

371
00:19:37,964 --> 00:19:39,737
My boy's okay!

372
00:19:39,754 --> 00:19:41,492
CROWD (chanting):
Bart! Bart! Bart!

373
00:19:41,572 --> 00:19:43,419
I won the science fair!

374
00:19:43,444 --> 00:19:45,264
I get to go to Chicago!

375
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:46,958
CROWD:
Bart! Bart! Bart!

376
00:19:46,992 --> 00:19:50,017
Ugh. Bart, Bart, Bart.

377
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:52,140
You know what I think
about regrets?

378
00:19:52,164 --> 00:19:54,799
As long as your family
is together,

379
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:57,627
every choice you've ever
made is the right one.

380
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,188
And together we are.

381
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:01,101
(gunshot)

382
00:20:01,126 --> 00:20:04,047
Would you guys knock it off?
He's down safe already.

383
00:20:04,065 --> 00:20:04,860
(gunshot)

384
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:07,342
MAN: Sorry, Chief, that
was me putting it down.

385
00:20:07,395 --> 00:20:09,639
And there you have it...
a family reunited.

386
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:12,649
And a grateful nation gives
thanks for some solid reporting.

387
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:14,418
Back to you, Rachel Maddow.

388
00:20:14,436 --> 00:20:15,624
Great job, Kent.

389
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:18,070
I think we might have an
opening for you at MSNBC

390
00:20:18,095 --> 00:20:22,193
between our weekend prison documentary
block and the two hours it takes

391
00:20:22,211 --> 00:20:23,979
to make up Joe Scarborough
on Monday morning.

392
00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:26,764
(chuckles): No, thanks, Rachel Maddow.
I'm happy right here.

393
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,101
No regrets.
