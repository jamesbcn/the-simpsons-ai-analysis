I'm the Lone Ranger!

345
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,207
Ooh!

346
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,046
Disco Stu wishes he'd
gone as Marilyn McCoo!

347
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,489
(MUTTERING)

348
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,849
Good luck getting your deposits
back on those costumes!

349
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,240
(ALL PROTESTING)

350
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,368
Seymour, I told you
not to go as G.I. Joe!

351
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,363
Mother, I'm fine. I...

352
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,567
Uh-oh.

353
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,565
Oh, this isn't fair.
I wasn't wearing a costume.

354
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,362
Look at me! I'm a young,
strappin' gorilla!

355
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,681
Ow! My hip, it's shattered.
Somebody help me.

356
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,564
Off we go to
the gorilla hospital.

357
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,804
ABE: That's it,
suck out the poison.

358
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,120
Wait a minute.

359
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,725
(ABE SCREAMS)

360
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,641
(HOWLING)

361
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,050
I am not a happy
meal right now.

362
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,888
I'm telling you, I'm Oberon,
king of the fairies!

363
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,084
You're a big fat bug!
And you're going down!

364
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,606
(CAT WHINING)

365
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,127
(GROANS) My spine is not a
scratching post! (MEOWS)

366
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,046
(IN GERMAN ACCENT) Oh! There must be
some way out of this <i>verdammten</i> spell.

367
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,487
Lisa, you think you could
check on your father?

368
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:17,771
Oh! That's an excellent use of a genius
brain, to look after an idiot head.

369
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,165
(GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION)

370
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,441
Uh!

371
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,841
Uh!

372
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,801
Dammit!

373
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,288
(GASPS) That's the answer!

374
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,684
Maggie's a real witch now.
She can reverse the spell!

375
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,001
(GROWLS) I don't want
to reverse the spell.

376
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,407
I can howl at the moon and eat rats.
(SQUEAKS)

377
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,971
(HOWLING)

378
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,366
(CRASHING)

379
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,329
I don't want
to change, either.

380
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,243
Now I can pull
horses out of the mud.

381
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,890
Then girls will like me.

382
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,803
And I'm Jared
from the Subway ads.

383
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,963
I'm only a little overweight
and sexually ambiguous.

384
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,247
Don't listen to them, Maggie.

385
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,640
Maggie?

386
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,041
Please change me back.

387
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,249
This bumblebee has developed an
unhealthy obsession with me.

388
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,171
I don't want flowers!
I am a flower!

389
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,164
As for Apu-D2,
I could go either way.

390
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,284
(IMITATES WHIRRING)
Click, click, oink.

391
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,562
HOMER: Please change...
(ALL TALKING AT ONCE)

392
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,607
Oh, well. This still
beats being Moe.

393
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,484
Okay, this concludes
this year's Halloween show.

394
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,370
We hope you had as much
fun watching our show

395
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,169
as the Koreans
did animating it.

396
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,609
But there's one group for
whom every day is Halloween.

397
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,808
I'm talking about
adult illiterates.

398
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,486
For them, trying to read
the morning newspaper

399
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,281
is more terrifying than any
goblin, ghoul, spook, or spirit.

400
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,131
So won't you please donate a
children's book or something?

401
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,681
Together we can make
reading a slam dunk.

402
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,002
Dennis Rodman?
What are you doing here?

403
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,491
Working off
a speeding ticket.

404
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,808
Happy Halloween, everybody!
