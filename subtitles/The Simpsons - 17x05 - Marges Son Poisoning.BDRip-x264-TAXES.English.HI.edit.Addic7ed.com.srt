Galdurnit, son. What the
hell kind of sissy are you?

177
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,041
Hey, are you calling
my life partner a sissy?

178
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,771
Because 100 bucks says he could
whoop you in arm wrestling.

179
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,411
A Texas penny it is.

180
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,641
Yee-haw!

182
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,884

Yes! Homer, we make
a dynamite team. Huh?

185
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,243
With your arm and my head gunk,
we're going right to the top.

186

(GUNS COOKING)
Whoa!

187
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,727
This is one
Texan who don't like

188
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,087
when he's made
out to be a fool.

189
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,730
Well, uh, what do you like?

190
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,845
I don't know. A good book,
long walk on the beach.

191
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,801
So, we, uh... We kind of
even things up here?

192
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,962
Not yet. l want to play
some Frisbee.

193
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,605
You know, honey,
I've really started

194
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,887
to look forward to
our little bike rides.

195
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,007
Me, too, Mother.

196
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,491
Oh, such respect?

197
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,767
You could grow up
to be a doorman.

Uh...

205
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,361
She died.

206

Hmm?

207
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,568
Well, Bart,
I guess that's it.

208
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,967
We'll have to go back
to our separate things.

209
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,361
Hey, we could have tea
in my tree house.

210
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,401
You invited me to
your tree house?

211
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,323
Wow!

212
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,483

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,043
So, is that standing water?

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,406
Yeah.
(BUZZING)

217
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,484

Hmm.

220
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,605
I think I might be able

221
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,729
to turn this tree house
into a teahouse.

222
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,047
Mom, this is great!

223
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,122
Makes our real house
look like a pile of crap.

224
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,884
And l threw out
all your old comics.

Today's mom knows
to seal them in Mylar

229
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,489
so you can never
read them again.

230

Never, ever again.

I'm joining a professional
arm wrestling circuit.

Uh-huh, and how will this affect
your job at the power plant?

234
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,210
Negatively, I assume.

235
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,851
Oh, well, we're off
to buy a new tea set.

236
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,287

Jeez, she didn't seem
angry or anything.

239
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,688
Maybe she doesn't care
anymore.

240
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,888
Forget about her, Homer.
She's dead to you now.

241
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,450
Okay.

242
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,726
Now, if we get bored
on the bus,

243
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,882
I got a book of
brainteasers here.

244
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,961

Ah, screw you,

"He is my son."
That blows.

is you're a mama's boy.

00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,086
You've got my teeth whitening
system in your suitcase.

350
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,410
Let's see. What would be
a good duet? Hmm.

(CHUCKLES)

354
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,164
I'm afraid that song's
taken by me and my mother.

355
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,131
You know, people say when we're on
stage, it's more like "scary-oke."

356
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,850
Uh, scary talented,
I assume.

357
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,082
I'm singing a song
with Bart tonight.

358
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,640
Capital! My mother and I
have been performing together

359
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,929
since l was in fourth grade, and
it's really brought us closer.

360
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,528
Seymour! Where were you? A
brightly-colored car hurt my eyes.

361
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,329
Don't worry, Mother.
I have your eye balm

363
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,881
Good boy. You can push your
crib into Mommy's room tonight.

364
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,247
It's not a crib. It's a cot.

365
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,891
If it has rails,
it's a crib!

You know, Mother,
I wasn't sure about tonight.

374
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,403
But seeing us dressed the same
really feels right. (BELLS JINGLING)

Well, now I'm not so sure about

saying what we're all thinking.

Mother,
what are you doing?

392

Don't call me "Mother."
My name is Mom.

see you turn into that!

Mom, l thought this
was what you wanted.

Your job isn't
to worry about me.

400

It's to give me things
to worry about.

Marge, spending time with
you is more important to me
