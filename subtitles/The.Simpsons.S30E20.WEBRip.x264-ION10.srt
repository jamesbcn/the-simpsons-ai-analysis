1
00:00:25,242 --> 00:00:27,244
D'oh!

2
00:00:48,352 --> 00:00:50,615
Everyone, out of my kitchen!

3
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:56,143
Brandine, do I come off
as a yokel or a hayseed?

4
00:00:56,186 --> 00:00:58,101
Well, you are versatile,
darlin'.

5
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:00,930
You can play anyone
in the trailer trash spectrum.

6
00:01:00,973 --> 00:01:04,238
A-yeah, I'm a regular
Benedict Cabbage-Patch.

7
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:09,808
Community thespians,

8
00:01:09,852 --> 00:01:13,290
today we return to
turn-of-the-century Oklahoma.

9
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:15,945
Farm boys are farming.
Cowboys are cowing.

10
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:18,556
And, Carl, do you think
your character Ike Skidmore

11
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,125
is bringing his cell phone
to the box social in 1906?

12
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:24,127
I see him
as a forward-thinking guy,

13
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:25,911
a tech first adopter.

14
00:01:25,955 --> 00:01:29,045
You know how I see him?
Not played by you!

15
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,352
Lenny, get yourself
out of that horse's patoot.

16
00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:32,918
You're Ike Skidmore.

17
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:35,399
Yee-haw! A speaking part!

18
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:37,401
This is gonna be tan-fastic.

19
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:40,578
Geez, don't make it
into a song and dance.

20
00:01:40,622 --> 00:01:43,581
<i>I've got spurs that
jingle, jangle, jing...</i>

21
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:47,281
My spur's stuck in my eye!

22
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:48,978
Carl, you're back in.

23
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:50,327
Well, only with
Lenny's blessing.

24
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:53,156
- You don't have it.
- I'm doing it anyway.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,420
Okay, Marge, this is
your big song number.

26
00:01:56,464 --> 00:01:59,771
You're Ado Annie,
the girl who can't say no.

27
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:02,774
Now, do you have any qualms
about playing this part?

28
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:06,256
- No.
- Wrong, wrong! You cain't say no.

29
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,866
Now, where's my handsome Curly?

30
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,433
Right here.

31
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:12,393
Now, this I can work with.

32
00:02:12,436 --> 00:02:13,350
Okay, Maggie,

33
00:02:13,394 --> 00:02:15,439
what shall we do
while Mommy rehearses?

34
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:16,962
The dog track is closed.

35
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:18,355
You can come visit me!

36
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,965
I didn't hear that.

37
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:22,185
Hmm, what shall we do?

38
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:25,188
Why is this place so popular?

39
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:28,017
Do they serve booze?
Is it a baby fight club?

40
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,888
Is there a big-screen TV?

41
00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:32,108
Do they serve booze?
Are there free doughnuts?

42
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,414
Meet Batman?

43
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:34,893
Do they serve booze?

44
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:36,982
We're going to find out.

45
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:39,985
Why in the hell
is Daddy and Me class packed?

46
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:43,902
You'll understand everything
when Chloe comes out.

47
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:45,687
Quiet, quiet, she's coming.

48
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,558
I borrowed my granddaughter
just for this.

49
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:49,647
I said I was taking her
to feed the ducks.

50
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:51,649
Like I have bread money.

51
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:52,824
Hi, dads.

52
00:02:52,868 --> 00:02:55,566
Who's ready to do
the wiggle worm dance?

53
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,003
I vant to viggle
like the vorm, ja.

54
00:02:58,047 --> 00:03:00,049
<i>A wiggle worm giggles</i>

55
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:01,877
<i>And a wiggle worm waggles</i>

56
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,489
<i>Let's all wiggle
like the wiggle worm does</i>

57
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:09,363
Oh, I get it, she's sexy.

58
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:12,627
Maggie! How long
have you been here?

59
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:18,459
Why does this line say Curt
when I'm talking to Curly?

60
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:21,375
No, you see, curt
is in parentheses.

61
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:23,681
It tells you
how to say the line.

62
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:26,118
Obviously lying...
yeah, no, I knew that.

63
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:29,383
Impressed noise.
You really know your stuff.

64
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:30,601
Okay, actors,

65
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:32,473
in the words
of William Shakespeare,

66
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:34,475
find your X and shut up.

67
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:36,477
Geez, all right, easy.

68
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,958
All I ask is that
you give me the performance

69
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:43,832
I have pictured in my head but
have not communicated to you.

70
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:47,139
Our curtain opens
on sun-drenched fields

71
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:50,186
of undulating golden corn.

72
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:55,147
Stop, stop, stop!

73
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:56,932
This set is terrible.

74
00:03:56,975 --> 00:04:00,109
That corn isn't as high
as an elephant's eye.

75
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:02,720
Oh, you wanted the corn
to be high.

76
00:04:02,764 --> 00:04:05,506
I have never seen
such incompetence and idiocy

77
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:06,724
in a theater.

78
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:09,379
You have made me hate you all.

79
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:12,382
Excuse my salty language
in front of Aunt Eller,

80
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:13,949
but why don't you
just take a hike?

81
00:04:15,994 --> 00:04:17,561
Get lost.

82
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:22,305
Losing temper,
we don't want you here.

83
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:26,135
Turns to cast, I saved the play.

84
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:28,529
Marge, surely you
want me to stay.

85
00:04:28,572 --> 00:04:30,400
Actually, no.

86
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:34,796
For the last time, that's
the one word you can't say.

87
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,102
This is mine.
I brought it from home.

88
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:38,452
Now what do we do?

89
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:41,324
I learned-a to speak
like-a the Oklahoma for this?

90
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:43,718
Con-a sarn it.

91
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,158
Everyone, stop, just stop.

92
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:50,594
Chief, no more gunplay.

93
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:52,596
But I wanna.

94
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:57,601
Just listen to me!

95
00:04:57,645 --> 00:05:00,169
What if I directed the play?

96
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:03,477
Hey, that's a good idea.
I mean, she directs Homer and the kids

97
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,000
out of the house every morning.

98
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:06,741
And I direct traffic.

99
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:08,395
That's a stupid analogy.

100
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:11,136
I think Marge makes us all
feel good about ourselves.

101
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:15,402
Yelling in unison.

102
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:18,709
Marge! Marge! Marge! Yay!

103
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:22,147
Wait a minute, if this is a
real gun, where's the prop?

104
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:24,367
Poor Lou.

105
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:26,151
All right, you asked for it.

106
00:05:26,195 --> 00:05:29,372
Who wants Oklahoma! tickets?
Front row.

107
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,591
I can get you three together.

108
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:40,470
This is
a really complicated show.

109
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:41,602
So much gingham.

110
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:44,213
We need a show
that we can actually pull off

111
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:45,475
in Springfield.

112
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,609
Small cast, simple sets,
and some hip-hop,

113
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:50,437
but not real hip-hop.

114
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,613
Great, but I got
to be someplace,

115
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:54,571
so, real quick,
the best kind of original show

116
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:57,269
is one that rips off a big hit.
What's the biggest hit?

117
00:05:57,313 --> 00:05:58,619
Hellzapoppin'!

118
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:01,404
No, Hamilton
by Lin-Manuel Miranda.

119
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:03,101
Oh, the guy from In the Heights.

120
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:05,756
Now, how did I know that?
I'm back!

121
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,890
All right, who's our
Alexander Hamilton?

122
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:12,328
That would be me.
Thanks to this furnace filter,

123
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,679
you won't be saying
"burr" anymore.

124
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:20,205
No, our most famous
historical figure...

125
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:22,425
Jebediah Springfield!

126
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:25,559
I'll write a musical biography,
warts and all.

127
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:27,474
I can't see how that could fail.

128
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:30,433
Now I'm in a hurry. Maggie and I
have a Daddy and Me class.

129
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:32,043
Aren't you forgetting something?

130
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:34,524
Keys, wallet, I don't think so.

131
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:37,005
Oh, sure.
I'm happy to take Maggie.

132
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:38,572
You sure like that class.

133
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:42,576
Oh, some dads just love
to be with their little girls.

134
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:44,621
- Can I go?
- Sorry, no.

135
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:47,276
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.

136
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,799
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.

137
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:53,891
Poor little eggy,
leaking your goo.

138
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:58,287
The Red Queen's not looking,
I'll kiss your boo-boo.

139
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,159
Humpty J. Dumpty,
are you eating yourself?

140
00:07:01,203 --> 00:07:03,379
Maybe.

141
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,778
Excuse me, excuse me, pal.
Take care of your kid.

142
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:14,564
I'm so sorry. I was just...

143
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:16,740
Yeah, I know what you were just.

144
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:17,915
Let's see...

145
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:21,397
killed a bear, founded a town,
died of a beaver bite.

146
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,703
Lis, you're gonna love it.

147
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:23,878
I came up
with the perfect opening.

148
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:25,488
Okay...

149
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:28,665
<i>Lisa is so stupid,
so very, very stupid</i>

150
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:32,539
<i>So dumb and stupid
and smelly too</i>

151
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:35,672
<i>She has a real bad temper,
a bad, bad temper</i>

152
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:38,501
<i>And she's smelly too!</i>

153
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,503
You're just motivating me.

154
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:42,505
I need to finish this.

155
00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:46,553
Ah, my muse.

156
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:48,511
Okay,

157
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:50,861
my first day as director.

158
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:53,124
So hard to dress for respect.

159
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:57,128
No. No.

160
00:07:57,172 --> 00:07:59,130
No.

161
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:00,915
Got it.

162
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:09,793
Hey-a, buddy, what'll it be?

163
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:11,142
Moe, it's me.

164
00:08:11,186 --> 00:08:13,623
Midge! I thought it was
Hillary Clinton.

165
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,190
Give me a vodka, straight up.

166
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:17,235
Are you sure you're not Hillary?

167
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:22,153
Our new production will be
Bloody Bloody Jebediah,

168
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:24,939
a hip-hop musical
about our city's founder.

169
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:26,680
Is it respectful?

170
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:28,159
Not entirely.

171
00:08:28,203 --> 00:08:29,552
What?!

172
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:31,772
Why don't we start
by going around the circle

173
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:33,338
and saying what parts
we're playing.

174
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:34,905
I'm Marge, the director.

175
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:36,951
Luann, Jebediah's wife.

176
00:08:36,994 --> 00:08:41,172
Carl, Quarrelsome Settler.
I got a bone to pick with this part.

177
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:42,957
Beautiful, use it. Next.

178
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,003
Lenny, Mayor of Shelbyville
and an ostrich.

179
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:52,619
Frink, tech crew. Always crew.

180
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:55,622
Hollywood only lets in
one Bill Nye in a generation.

181
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:57,841
With the nerdy and the hoyvik

182
00:08:57,885 --> 00:09:00,757
and the reference
only I understand.

183
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:04,848
And, of course, our incredible
star, Sideshow Mel.

184
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:06,763
Finally not a sidekick.

185
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:09,287
This is my time to shine.

186
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,725
Your first line is on page 37.

187
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:12,769
What?!

188
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:15,511
<i>Yo, Jebediah survived
the pox</i>

189
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,860
<i>Never used clocks</i>

190
00:09:16,904 --> 00:09:18,993
<i>Didn't wear socks,
that's what we learned</i>

191
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:22,257
<i>From examining his docs,
and now the mic drops</i>

192
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,693
Boom, et cetera.

193
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:25,695
Krusty, what's wrong?

194
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:27,654
It's happened...
the worst possible thing

195
00:09:27,697 --> 00:09:29,830
that can happen to a performer.

196
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:31,048
What do you mean?

197
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,615
I'm in an article entitled...

198
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,269
Where Are They Now?

199
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,230
Right above Judd Nelson
and New Coke.

200
00:09:39,274 --> 00:09:41,189
I'll tell you
where Judd Nelson is.

201
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:44,018
He's on my show tonight.

202
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,240
Fantastic!

203
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:50,764
What's that thing
you were doing?

204
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:54,419
Oh, local theater.
You wouldn't be interested.

205
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:56,770
Hey, I'm a performer, an artist,

206
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:59,294
which means I'm always
interested in money.

207
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:02,297
Live theater is the only thing
getting ratings these days.

208
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,472
Who owns the rights?

209
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:06,214
A Mrs. Marge Simpson.

210
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:09,696
Oh, really?
Let's see what kind of bargain

211
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:12,350
Mrs. Marge Simpson drives.

212
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:15,832
So you'll get 80% of the profits

213
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:18,705
while I get foreign distribution
rights in Venezuela

214
00:10:18,748 --> 00:10:20,794
for a window of three weeks.

215
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:26,451
So my little show's
gonna be on TV live?

216
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:28,845
Yep. This is the first time
a woman has signed something

217
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:31,500
with me where I didn't lose
custody of something.

218
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:33,067
So where will we stage it?

219
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,809
Outside,
where the lighting is free.

220
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:37,898
Ooh, are you sure
that's not risky?

221
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:41,031
Well, some would say I'm taking
a risk with an original play

222
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:45,296
and a first-time director, but
show business is based on risks.

223
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,864
Risks and comic books.
Excuse me.

224
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,914
So, Marge, are you ready
to beg me to come back?

225
00:10:53,957 --> 00:10:57,047
Actually, Llewellyn,
we're doing fine on our own.

226
00:10:57,091 --> 00:11:00,050
No need to grovel. You don't
actually have to say anything.

227
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,530
Okay, fine, I'll come back.

228
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:03,706
No one's asking you
to come back.

229
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,100
You know what? Just for that,
I won't come back.

230
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:09,886
- Fine.
- Please, I'm begging you, take me back.

231
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:13,063
All right, but beware,

232
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:15,892
hell hath no fury
like a director scorned.

233
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:17,502
Now, if you'll excuse me,

234
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:20,114
I have to sneak my headshot
onto the wall.

235
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:22,551
And poof.

236
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:23,944
You're flushed, Plummer.

237
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:26,424
I hired you to bus tables.

238
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,910
I'm researching a role.

239
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,310
Now, Mom, before you go
into that production meeting,

240
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:46,096
I want to pass along a quote
from F. Scott Fitzgerald.

241
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,100
Great art is the contempt
of a great woman for small art.

242
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:53,103
He actually said man, but he'd
have wanted me to change it.

243
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:55,540
Didn't he also say,
show me a hero

244
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:57,978
and I'll write you a tragedy?

245
00:11:58,021 --> 00:12:00,676
Yes, but he also said,

246
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,853
never confuse a single defeat
with a final defeat.

247
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:05,420
But didn't he also say,

248
00:12:05,463 --> 00:12:08,205
there are no second acts
in American lives?

249
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:10,207
Just get in the meeting!

250
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:12,470
The bagels are getting hard.

251
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:19,347
There's my Jebediah.

252
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,784
Marge, I'm leaving the show

253
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:24,265
to fulfill a lifelong dream...

254
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:26,920
playing Prospero in The Tempest.

255
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:28,704
You can't quit now.

256
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,271
We're live in three days.

257
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:32,273
We have no understudy.

258
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:36,059
And you were gonna bring
the edibles for the wrap party.

259
00:12:36,103 --> 00:12:38,061
Not my problem.

260
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:40,977
There's nothing I enjoy more
than watching a director

261
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:44,415
trying to talk an actor out
of leaving for a better part.

262
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,809
Dramatic twist!

263
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,860
<i>Sing a song of sixpence,
a pocketful of rye</i>

264
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:57,472
<i>Four and 20 blackbirds
baked in a pie</i>

265
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,868
Stay in there,
you stupid blackbirds!

266
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:05,175
Darling, you're supposed
to kill the blackbirds

267
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:07,264
before you put them
in the pie.

268
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:09,527
Homie, Homie.

269
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:13,096
- Homie. Homie.
- Blackbirds! Blackbirds!

270
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,619
Homie, wake up.

271
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:16,099
What are you dreaming about?

272
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:17,971
Daddy and Me class.

273
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:20,103
You are a great father.

274
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:23,063
Oh, I wish I felt
like a great director.

275
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:25,674
Fine, if you want me to quit
the class, I'll do it.

276
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:27,328
Who said anything
about quitting?

277
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:30,287
I've had enough people
quit on me today.

278
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:32,724
Marge, anyone who can raise
two girls and two boys

279
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:34,465
the way you're doing
can do anything.

280
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:36,511
You're gonna make it.

281
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:39,514
I've got
a special announcement today.

282
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:41,211
You're gonna wear the perfume
I bought you?

283
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:42,517
Even better.

284
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,084
Barry's divorce came through,

285
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:47,130
so I'm able to leave this class
and marry him.

286
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:49,480
Come on up, Barry.

287
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:52,657
Later, losers.

288
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:55,138
Barry's not sitting
cross-legged anymore.

289
00:13:55,182 --> 00:13:56,574
Why him?

290
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:58,054
Maybe I have the cutest baby.

291
00:13:58,098 --> 00:14:00,448
Or maybe the first words
I got her to say were

292
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:02,232
I love you, Chloe.

293
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:04,800
I love you, Chloe.

294
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,455
We sang Wheels on the Bus
together.

295
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:09,022
Well, that's it. Time to...

296
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:11,589
Where's the baby I brought?

297
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:15,506
Ah, geez. I won't be dating
her grandma anymore.

298
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:19,946
So I guess we're not
doing the class.

299
00:14:22,165 --> 00:14:26,126
Wait a minute, the part you liked
was spending time with me?

300
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:30,173
Well, I'll always dance
with you, sweetie.

301
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:41,968
Okay, no pressure,
but I need to find a new lead

302
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:43,970
in the next 15 minutes.

303
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:45,188
Preferably a name.

304
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:46,973
Is Bumblebee Man available?

305
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:49,410
No, he's playing Don Quixote
in Man of La Mancha.

306
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:52,979
Damn it. Why is this town's
theater scene so vibrant?

307
00:14:53,022 --> 00:14:56,069
I'm here to audition
for the part of Macbeth.

308
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:57,505
It's not Macbeth.

309
00:14:57,548 --> 00:14:59,072
- Is it Macduff?
- Not Macduff.

310
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:01,988
Well, there's no other parts
worth playing!

311
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:03,554
That's it. We're doomed.

312
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:05,165
We'll just have a bake sale.

313
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,862
Will you serve haggis?

314
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,603
- No.
- I'm out.

315
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:11,998
<i>A pioneer with no fear</i>

316
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,000
<i>Shooting deer</i>

317
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:16,002
<i>On the frontier...</i>

318
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:17,829
Spotlight that singer.

319
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:21,398
<i>And the crowds all cheer</i>

320
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:24,445
<i>Jebediah Springfield</i>

321
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:28,449
<i>Found the town right here</i>

322
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:29,972
Yes, glavin, it's me,

323
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:35,325
with the Gomer Pyle voice and
the unexpectedly good singing.

324
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:36,631
You've got the part.

325
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:37,632
<i>Thank you!</i>

326
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:39,068
Save your voice.

327
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:42,071
All right, then.

328
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:46,467
Marge, as your producer, I'm
gonna inform you of a problem,

329
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,686
then blame you
if you can't solve it.

330
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,688
Now what?

331
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:53,430
There's one thing a first-time
director cannot control.

332
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:54,649
Bruce Willis?

333
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:56,259
No, the weather.

334
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:58,870
- Marge, it's going to rain during the show.
- How hard?

335
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:02,918
Well, let's just say I hope
you liked the movie Waterworld.

336
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,616
Ambitious, but unsatisfying.

337
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,618
You might want
to consider canceling.

338
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:10,621
I don't know much about showbiz,
but I know one thing.

339
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:12,797
The show must go on.

340
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:14,625
I never heard that before.

341
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:16,845
Really? Well, tell me
to break a leg.

342
00:16:16,888 --> 00:16:19,456
Why would I do that?
It's violent and cruel.

343
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,068
Well, there's no business
like show business.

344
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:23,634
Nah, nah, now that's not true.

345
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:25,071
Most show business companies

346
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:27,247
are part of much larger
conglomerates.

347
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,162
Just get the hell out.

348
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:31,033
That I've heard before.

349
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:36,430
Going live.
Break a leg, everyone.

350
00:16:36,473 --> 00:16:38,432
- What?
- Why would you wish that?

351
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:40,129
You're mean.

352
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:45,221
<i>Let me tell you
about a mystery</i>

353
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:46,657
<i>Of our city's history</i>

354
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:48,485
<i>An out-of-towner was
our founder</i>

355
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:50,270
<i>Despite his latent bigotry</i>

356
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:52,489
<i>How did this pioneer
domineer</i>

357
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:55,318
<i>Persevere,
then die right here?</i>

358
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:58,495
<i>Before the tire fire,
a man named Jebediah</i>

359
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:02,021
<i>Made Springfield
the new frontier...</i>

360
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,154
Cue camera three.

361
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:06,503
Cue Bart.

362
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,336
<i>That's right, my name
is Jebediah Springfield</i>

363
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,339
<i>There is none to whom I yield</i>

364
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:18,124
<i>No king to whom I've kneeled</i>

365
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:22,998
<i>Tonight
my secrets are revealed</i>

366
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:31,267
<i>Jebediah Springfield</i>

367
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:40,711
<i>Now, this bear and I
are one and the same</i>

368
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:43,584
<i>He gave his life
so that I could have fame</i>

369
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:46,587
<i>Jebediah Springfield</i>

370
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,154
Cut to commercial.

371
00:17:48,197 --> 00:17:51,766
That's a cut
to commercial, everyone.

372
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:53,376
John Lithgow?

373
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,248
I like to work.

374
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,467
- Oh, line, please?
- Grrr.

375
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:00,209
No, you fool, a rescue line.

376
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:01,776
Mom, what do we do?

377
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:03,386
Improvise.

378
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,172
Lisa, I need a five-minute rap
about the cruelty of the sea

379
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:08,783
and the brave souls
who rise above it.

380
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:11,829
No problem. Can I make sly
analogies to today's politics?

381
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:13,048
No. You'll date it.

382
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:17,574
<i>The bullets flew like rain</i>

383
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:19,054
<i>As buffalo were slain...</i>

384
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,796
Who wants to change the channel?

385
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,624
Either they're all dead
or it's a hit.

386
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,191
Fifty-fifty.

387
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:31,501
<i>And now I have
a raging fever</i>

388
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:35,201
<i>Bitten by a rabid beaver</i>

389
00:18:35,244 --> 00:18:38,160
<i>I didn't fight
for equal rights</i>

390
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:42,817
<i>I wish I'd done more
for non-whites</i>

391
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,169
<i>But no more time
for Jebediah</i>

392
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:52,174
<i>All that's left to do</i>

393
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:55,612
<i>Is</i>

394
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:58,224
<i>Die-a</i>

395
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:06,971
In unison...

396
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:08,843
Marge! Marge! Marge!

397
00:19:08,886 --> 00:19:11,759
This is the happiest moment...

398
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:14,805
Careers are getting shorter
than ever these days.

399
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,810
Marge, we got the highest rating
in modern TV history.

400
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:21,595
A 0.6!

401
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:23,466
Congratulations.

402
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:27,992
I did it. I directed
a popular off-Broadway musical.

403
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:30,821
And I wrote a popular
off-Broadway musical.

404
00:19:30,865 --> 00:19:33,520
And I caught an octopus
on Main Street. What a day.

405
00:19:36,264 --> 00:19:39,482
And the winner for
Outstanding Lead Performance

406
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:41,005
in a Play or Musical.

407
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:44,095
Oh, mein Gott! It's Sideshow Mel
for The Tempest.

408
00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:50,450
Barbara, you can put
the kids to bed now.

409
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:53,714
Is what I'd like to say,
but I'm childless.

410
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:57,500
One pie to the groin
won't do damage, they said.

411
00:19:57,544 --> 00:19:59,154
They were wrong!

412
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,461
12 nominations, zero awards.

413
00:20:01,504 --> 00:20:03,811
Welcome to Club Snub, Marge.

414
00:20:03,854 --> 00:20:06,814
Feel the bile rising, the
bitterness that will never...

415
00:20:06,857 --> 00:20:10,948
And a special award for
Best Newcomer, Marge Simpson.

416
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:12,733
Damn it!

417
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,264
<i>Ah, hell, give me</i>

418
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:25,398
<i>A white wine spritzer</i>

419
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:27,313
<i>Ah, hell, give me</i>

420
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:31,360
<i>A white wine spritzer</i>

421
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,347
<i>The end</i>
