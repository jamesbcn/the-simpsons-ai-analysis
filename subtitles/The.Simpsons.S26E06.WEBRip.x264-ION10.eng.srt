00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,651
Bender's mission protocol
is definitely intact.

177
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,322
It just requires a delicate procedure

178
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,902
known as "unplug and re-plug."

179
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,568
(chuckles, mumbles)

180
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,494
Because that fixes everything.

181
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,946
-(whirring)
-I remember why I'm here!

182
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,367
To kill Homer Simpson!

183
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,167
-(gasps)
-(singsongy) My ears are burning.

184
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,881
(singsongy)
Not yet, but they will be.

185
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,051
(yelps)
A boxing glove!

186
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,181
But we bowled together.

187
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,984
Oh, I can't do it.

188
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,899
What stopped you, Bender,
Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics?

189
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,069
You think robots care what some
hack science fiction writer thinks?

190
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,489
I killed Isaac Asimov
on the way over here.

191
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,778
Well, Isaac somebody.

192
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,322
What the...?
My ass is about to project something.

193
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,656
(loud whisper)
You don't have to announce it.

194
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:16,122
Just do it quietly and blame the dog.

195
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,504
<i>Bender,</i>

196
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,000
we've just regained contact.

197
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,581
Have you killed Homer Simpson?

198
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,666
Uh, yep.

199
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,671
Killed him good.

200
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,882
<i>If Homer's dead,</i>

201
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,711
why are the creatures he begat

202
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,506
still here
and multiplying out of control?

203
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,391
(all chattering angrily)

204
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,299
What the...?

205
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,426
<i>You lied to me, Bender!</i>

206
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,604
<i>Homer Simpson's still alive!</i>

207
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,192
Come on, Bender, stabbity-stabbity.

208
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,398
Wait! Stop!
Why must you kill my dad?

209
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,650
Especially when cheeseburgers
are doing the work for you.

210
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:49,323
<i>Homer Simpson</i>
<i>must be eliminated immediately.</i>

211
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:52,913
The creatures destroying
New New York have his DNA.

212
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,499
The monsters are stealing
our office supplies!

213
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,289
That's inexcusable!

214
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,793
Gah!

215
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,174
Um...

216
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,751
<i>Hello, robot.</i>

217
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,835
Looks like <i>everyone</i> gets
a turn to say something.

218
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,802
This concludes my turn.

219
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,762
We sent Bender back in time
to kill Homer

220
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,183
before the monsters
could evolve from him.

221
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,683
Apparently,
this was too heartless a task for a robot.

222
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,846
Leela, can you handle it?

223
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,015
In a New New York minute minute.

224
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:25,944
(explosion)

225
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,153
-(grunts)
-Ow!

226
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:31,895
(chuckles)

227
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,198
Ow!

228
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,621
Right in my language center!

229
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:38,119
(jittery gibberish)

230
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,912
Professor,
y-you're a fellow man of science.

231
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,656
Maybe if we teamed up,

232
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,077
we could, uh, figure something out.

233
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:48,956
Okay. Eh, but remember,
to me you're incredibly stupid.

234
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,336
Oh, and the annoying girl may be helpful.

235
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,014
Meanwhile, Leela,
take Homer and explore this time period.

236
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:59,274
Find out why people would ever pay
for "freemium games."

237
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,348
I'll explain.

238
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,193
Okay, it <i>starts</i> free, right?

239
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,099
<i>Then </i>you visit your friend's game,

240
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,607
and he's got this awesome
candy mansion...

241
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,860
Get a load of those freaks!

242
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,493
And you're like, "99 cents?!

243
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,530
You bet I'd like one!"

244
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,871
And that's why I owe
Clash of Candies $20,000.

245
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,325
Here we are.

246
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:28,085
Marge,
I'd like you to meet Leela and Fry.

247
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,879
<i>MARGE: Oh, don't mention her eye.</i>
<i>Don't mention her eye.</i>

248
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,013
<i>LEELA: Don't mention her hair.</i>
<i>Don't mention her hair.</i>

249
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,890
I... am so pleased to meet you.

250
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,298
Nice to be hair.

251
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,096
-(laughs)
-(soft grumble)

252
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,680
Oh, Lord.

253
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,135
(professors mumbling)

254
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,515
Professor Farnsworth,

255
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,232
I'm dying to know how you got here.

256
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,652
-Was it a time machine?
-Little girl,

257
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,281
time machines
are physical impossibilities.

258
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,359
We teleported through a singularity

259
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,324
that I quantum entangled to Bender

260
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,874
under the guise of fixing his collar.

261
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,908
Yes,
but how did Bender get here?

262
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,912
-With a time machine.
-But you just said that...

263
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,504
-(bell dings)
-Sample's ready!

264
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,670
(snores)
Kill all humans.

265
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,129
(snores)
Kill all humans.

266
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,800
(snores)

267
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,128
Start with Flanders.

268
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,383
(snores)

269
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,764
Start with Flanders.

270
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,090
Good news, everyone!

271
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,506
That means it's bad.

272
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,304
The human DNA in the creatures

273
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,848
was only half Homer's.

274
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,641
The other half came from...

275
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,524
someone else.

276
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,731
Oh, so we can kill that person instead.

277
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,522
Maybe they're evil and deserve it.

278
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,815
Or have one of those annoying <i>voices</i>

279
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,819
that gets on everybody's nerves,

280
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,201
with the adding
extra noises for no reason.

281
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,778
Myveen.

282
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,873
Bloingy.

283
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,909
And the other person is...

284
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,793
HOMER:
Oh, who's that?

285
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,792
-It's me.
-(gasps)

286
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,134
Wait a minute.
We don't have to kill you.

287
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,840
Oh, well, that's better.

288
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,210
We just have to kill all your children.

289
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,217
-(exclaims)
-Or just one of them.

290
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,929
If you can figure out which
one sired the killer rabbits.

291
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,511
(whistling)

292
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,716
(rattling)

293
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,136
<i>We interrupt this hologram</i>

294
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,184
to bring you an important bulletin.

295
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,728
The horrific creatures
destroying New New York

296
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,482
have begun metamorphosing.

297
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,824
(laughs)

298
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,278
(muffled screaming)

299
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,156
(grunting)

300
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,738
(all growling)

301
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,453
(man gasping)

302
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,203
Eat my shorts!

303
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,195
<i>¡Ay, caramba!</i>

304
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,907
(laughs)

305
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,917
What a surprise.
It's Bart.

306
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,499
Wow,

307
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,674
I'm doing the same jokes
a thousand years later.

308
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,053
<i>¡Ay, caramba!</i>

309
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,259
But how did a mere boy
destroy the future?

310
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,430
Well...

311
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,557
<i>Let this be a lesson.</i>

312
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,475
<i>Never throw meaningless crap</i>
<i>in a time capsule.</i>

313
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:58,145
That's it! All we have to do
is dig up the time capsule.

314
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,895
And bury Bart in the hole.

315
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,447
I thought people in the future

316
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,450
would be more full of peace and love.

317
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,122
Like in Epcot Center.

318
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,201
In our time,
Epcot Center is a work farm for the weak.

319
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,707
Oh, but it's not as crowded

320
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,329
as the slave labor camps
at Universal Studios.

321
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,087
(grumbles)

322
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,049
(tires screeching)

323
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,259
HOMER:
We're here.

324
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,427
(chuckles)
My bowling buddy.

325
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,852
GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE:
Hey!

326
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,560
You can't dig that up
for a thousand years.

327
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,021
Plus, I wrote my name there.

328
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,020
See?

329
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,352
(rattling)

330
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,807
<i>Shmayday!</i>

331
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,687
Shmayday!
(gasps) They got Scruffy!

332
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,775
Nope.
They just got my mustache.

333
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,280
But a life without a mustache
ain't worth livin'.

334
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,276
<i>FARNSWORTH:</i>
<i>No!</i>

335
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,366
That generator powers the portal.

336
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,251
If they destroy it, we'll be...

337
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,328
(exclaims)

338
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,662
(grunts)

339
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,077
...sucked back into the future.

340
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,972
Okay, head count.
One, two, three... (gasps)

341
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,680
Where's Maggie?

342
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,509
{\an8}Well, little meatbag,

343
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,767
it looks like it's just you and me.

344
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,850
Stuck in a terrible past

345
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,265
where I know the result

346
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,903
of every horse race ever!

347
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,981
To the track!

348
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,356
-I want that.
-Well, you can't have it.

349
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,989
(glass breaking)

350
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,156
Why, you little...
Why, you little...

351
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,878
Why, you little...

352
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,418
Why, you little...
Why, you little...

353
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,171
Dad, it's me.

354
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,713
Prove it.
When's your birthday?

355
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,086
February 23rd.

356
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,512
Ha! February has no 23rd.

357
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,932
-You... (grunts)
-(grunting)

358
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,550
Yes, it does.

359
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,596
Can you please just get us
out of this lousy future?

360
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:54,601
Actually, of all probable futures,
this is the worst.

361
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,055
It is, 'cause my baby's not in it.

362
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,556
Motherly love.

363
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,647
Why did we outlaw that?

364
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,193
Madam, our mechanical friend
Bender is your portal home.

365
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,408
But we can't use him until
the generator is repaired.

366
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,369
Homer works at a nuclear plant.

367
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,330
He can help us get home.

368
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,160
Oh, are you good at your job?

369
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,325
I was voted employee of the month

370
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,584
as an April Fools' Day joke.

371
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,036
Why, you little...
Why, you little...

372
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:20,997
Great.

373
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,086
You and Fry
can bumble around together

374
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,592
while the rest of us
give up and make peace

375
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,764
with our various deities.

376
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:31,013
As for me, I'm an atheist.

377
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,516
Oh, nobody's father, who art nowhere,

378
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:37,099
I know you can't hear me,
completely ignore this prayer.

379
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,646
Nothing art thou and nothing
will thou ever be.

380
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,031
Jesus was just a man.

381
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,738
ALL:
Amen.

382
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:48,448
Well, I shall stay here
for the decadence.

383
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:52,080
There's no debauchery
like end-of-the-world debauchery.

384
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,789
Your lips, my lips, apocalypse, ooh!

385
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,870
I can't believe
you're all giving up without a fight.

386
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:58,917
Lisa,

387
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,169
we're just a package delivery service.

388
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,671
And not a very good one.

389
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,253
The only way to handle
the creatures

390
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,418
is to do what we do to each year's

391
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,427
Super Bowl losers:
shoot them into space.

392
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,640
But we'd have to round them up first.

393
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,180
Let me take care of that.

394
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,143
If there's one thing I know how to do,

395
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,734
it's manipulate Barts.

396
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,099
You're nuts.
I've got a will of iron.

397
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,516
(deep humming)

398
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,280
(mumbles)

399
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,239
Okay, let's get going.

400
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,952
(drooling)

401
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,405
Dad, we have beer in our time.

402
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:37,202
Hey, I haven't had a drink
in a thousand years.

403
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,867
(horse neighs)

404
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,576
(gasps)
There's a horse called Bender's Bounty.

405
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,588
But my memory says
he died during the race.

406
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,550
That can't be true.

407
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,260
<i>ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i>And way, way, way back is Bender's Bounty.</i>

408
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,642
Damn it!

409
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,683
Oh, Chief, it looks like a robot

410
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,183
killing horses over there.

411
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,675
Oh, a 608...

412
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,436
Lou, can't you just
let me enjoy my day off?

413
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,519
W-Why are you dressed
in your uniform, then?

414
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,404
'Cause they're the only clothes
that fit me.

415
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,821
You happy? Happy?

416
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,149
Attention, goblins.

417
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,815
Madison Cube Garden
is filled with Butterfinger bars.

418
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,235
And people are laying fingers
all over them!

419
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,244
(cackling, grunting)

420
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,826
They're evolving. Wow.

421
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,412
That's a first for you, Bart.

422
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,497
Will you shut up?

423
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,593
-(gentle melody plays)
-(grunting)

424
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,936
Uh, did I remind you
to strap yourselves in?

425
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,202
(all cheering)

426
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,951
You realize you're cheering the death

427
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,583
of millions of my children.

428
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,949
(all cheering)

429
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,423
Wow, it's working.

430
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,005
I guess the instructions <i>were</i> in English.

431
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,181
What the...?!

432
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,838
Whoa!

433
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,638
Hey, here's a souvenir photo
of you guys coming out of my chest.

434
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,523
Aw, I will treasure this forever.

435
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,891
Lie detected.

436
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:27,727
Oh, my sweet baby.

437
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,565
Oh, feels like you have a full diaper.

438
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,991
Ooh, um, I'll change her.

439
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,333
(whispers)
Here's your cut.

440
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,247
Nice knowing you, meatbags.

441
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,748
Have fun turning to dust.

442
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,330
Wait, wait, wait.
You're the portal.

443
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,245
How are you
gonna get to the future?

444
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,174
The old-fashioned way.

445
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,087
Good night, friend.

446
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:59,095
You'll always have a special place
here with us.

447
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,139
(grunting)

448
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,822
Thanks, pal.

449
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,592
(eerie music playing)

450
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,505
Look at this mess.

451
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,589
It would have disintegrated upon entry

452
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,014
if someone hadn't turned off
the atmosphere last night.

453
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,104
I like it cold when I'm sleeping.

454
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,520
Besides, these horrible
Earth creatures are delicious.

455
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,730
The Johnsons will be here
for dinner any minute.

456
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,611
What happened
to the handsome man I married?

457
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,279
-I ate him, remember?
-Here they are.

458
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,278
Uh, hmm...

459
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,030
Hope we're not interrupting anything.

460
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,283
(burps)

461
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,414
I can't take any more.

462
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,492
(sobbing)

463
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,121
I-I can't take it.

464
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,037
Well, perhaps the one of you
that is female should go console her.
