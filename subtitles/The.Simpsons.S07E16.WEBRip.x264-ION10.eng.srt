{\an8}I don't know why.

{\an8}It's a perfectly

Now, you all know

33
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,030
Springfield's 200th birthday
is only a week away.

34
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,874
Every class will do its part
to make our local Bicentennial

35
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,540
just as memorable
as our national Bicentennial.

36
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,209
Of course, you children
are too young to remember that

37
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,328
with the possible exception
of Kearney.

38
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,705
Those tall ships really lifted

00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,173

40
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,844
To celebrate our Bicentennial

41
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,632
all 20 of you
will write an essay

42
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,295
about Jebediah Springfield.

43
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,224
And the best 18
will be put on file

44
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,432

45
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,472

who requests them.

46
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,846
Can we do illustrations?

47
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,852
No.

00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,643
Hey...

49
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,897
they need volunteers

50
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,149
to play old-timey people
in the parade.

51
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,731
Look, I can be a butter churner,
a typhoid carrier...

52
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,398
an apprentice.

53
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,026
I think I'll be
an apprentice, Marge.

54
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,453
What kind
of apprentice?

55
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,531
That's for my master
to decide.

56
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,736
How about town crier?

57
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,736

00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,077

59
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,542
Well, yeah, Dad, you're
a big fat loudmouth.

00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,171
And you can walk

61
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,828
Well, if you kids
believe in me that much,

62
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,037

I'm the curator,
Hollis Hurlbut.

71
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,369
Hi. I'm Lisa Simpson.

72
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,536
I'm here to research
a report on Jebediah.

73
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,825
Oh, you're in for a treat.

74
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,378
You know, some historians

75
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,091
consider Jebediah Springfield
a minor patriot.

76
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,632
But I think you'll find
he's easily the equal

77
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,506
of William Dawes
or even Samuel Otis.

78
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,886
Congratulations, Ned.

79
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,096
-You are our new town crier.
-D'oh!

with his cromulent performance.

95
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,354
Top notch criering, I admit.

96
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,404
But the hat and bell
belong to Flanders,

97
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,728
so no dice.

98
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,943
Oh-ho-ho, they're just
family heirlooms.

99
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,403
That shouldn't stand in the way
of Homer taking my job.

100
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,614

106
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,325
You're to restrict
your criering to the parade

107
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,627
and selected pre-approved
publicity events.

108
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,631
Okay.

109
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,642
This case holds
our most treasured exhibit.

110
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,599

used by Jebediah.

111
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,060
Here's his fife

112
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,890
upon which he sounded
the sweet note of freedom.

113
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,726
His hatchet,
which he hacked

114
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,351
at the chains of oppression,

115
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,518

"Know ye who read this

125
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,770
there is more to my life
than history records..."

126
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,018
Firstly, I did not tame
the legendary buffalo.

127
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,561
It was already tame.
I merely shot it.

128
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,765
Secondly, I have not always
been known

129
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,277
as Jebediah Springfield.

130
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,280
Until 1796,

131
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:06,532
I was Hans Sprungfeld,
murderous pirate.

132
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,866
And the half-wits of this town
will never learn the truth.

133
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,832

134
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,496

135
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,093
Oh, my God!

136
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,298
Our town hero is a fraud.

137
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,339
"I write this confession
so that my infamy will live on

138
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:26,683
long after my body has succumbed
to my infectious diphtheria."

139
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:27,681
Ew.

140
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,642
(yells)

141
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,766
Ugh. Agh. Ugh. Agh.

142
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,645
HOLLIS: Here's Johnnycakes.

143
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,737
Is everything okay?

144
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,989
You look a bit flushed.

145
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,150
Oh, it's just
the excitement

146
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,608
of studying Jebediah.

147
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,447
Sounds like
you've come down

148
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,243
with a serious case
of "Jebeditis."

149
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,827
Just when I was getting over
my "Chester A. Arthritis."

150
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,253
(both chuckling)

151
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,252
You had arthritis?

152
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,464
Um... no.

153
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,206
(bell ringing)

154
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,677
Hear ye, hear ye!
What's for breakfast?

155
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:06,758
Toast.

156
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,973
I don't understand thee, Marge.

157
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,603
Hmm. Ye olde toast.

158
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,681
Ooh!

159
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,436
{\an8}What would you say
if I told you

160
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,268
{\an8}that Jebediah Springfield
wasn't as great

161
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,563
{\an8}as he's cracked
up to be? Look.

162
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,227
Jebediah was really
a vicious pirate

163
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,065
named Hans Sprungfeld.

164
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,361
His tongue was bitten off
by a Turk

165
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,105
in a grog house fight.

166
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,486
No tongue, eh?

167
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,413
How did he talk
and eat and laugh and love?

168
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,452
He had a prosthetic tongue
made out of silver.

169
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,037
Yes. That'd do.

170
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,833
He was one of the
evilest men of the 1780s.

171
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,917
He even tried to kill
George Washington.

172
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,633
The dastard!

173
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,755
Give me all your money.

174
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,805
Never!

175
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,599
(laughing)

176
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,272
(both grunting)

177
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,901
Ooh! Ow!

178
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,527
I got the white
stars you wanted

179
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,115
but I couldn't find
any red hearts

180
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,370
yellow moons or
green clovers.

181
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,082
Well, I'll use it,

182
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,752
but I'm not paying for it.

183
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,421
{\an8}The next time Hans
Sprungfeld was seen

184
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,881
{\an8}he had changed his name

185
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,590
to Jebediah Springfield.

186
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,840
Lisa, honey,

187
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,922
when my family first
came to this state,

188
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,837
they had a choice of living
in Springfield or Stenchburg.

189
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,718
You know why they
chose Springfield?

190
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,135
Because everyone knows
Jebediah Springfield

191
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,484
was a true American hero,
end of story!

192
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,189
I believe you, honey.

193
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,480
You do?

194
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,153
Of course I do.

195
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,572
You're always right
about this type of thing

196
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,740
and for once, I want in
on the ground floor.

197
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,658
Oh, thanks, Dad.

198
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,988
Ralph, "A," Janey, "A,"

199
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,695
and Lisa, for your--

200
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,945
(clearing throat)
essay,

201
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,326
"Jebediah Springfield:
Super Fraud," "F."

202
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,544
But it's all true.

203
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,134
Ah! This is nothing

204
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,089
but dead-white-male bashing
from a P.C. thug.

205
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,630
It's women like you
who keep the rest of us

206
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,054
from landing a husband.

207
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,592
Well, nice talking to you.

208
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,177
(sobbing)

209
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,889
(door slams)

210
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,274
Lisa?

211
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,890
Miss Hoover thought
I made the whole thing up.

212
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,648
She called me a P.C. thug.

213
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,860
I've been called
a greasy thug, too,

214
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,571
and it never stops
hurting,

215
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,111
so here's what
we're going to do:

216
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,994
grease ourselves
up real good

217
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,661
and trash that place
with a baseball bat.

218
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,870
(sniffles)
That won't help, Dad.

219
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,581
No one's ever gonna
believe me.

220
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,911
But you have proof.

221
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,036
We could go get
that confession

222
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,292
out of Jebediah's fife.

223
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,963
-We could?
-Come on.

224
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,921
We can use the baseball bat
to smash open the case.

225
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,882
-No baseball bat.
-Oh!

226
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,009
Hi, Mr. Hurlbut.

227
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,261
Oh, you're back.

228
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,472
And you've brought a friend.

229
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,313
Town Crier. I'd like
to ask you a few questions.

230
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,728
One: where's the fife,
and two: give me the fife.

231
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,808
Hey! Stop!

232
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:02,982
I've got nothing
but respect

233
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,310
for the office
of town crier

234
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,605
but this is well outside
your jurisdiction.

235
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:10,229
Oh, yeah? Well, put this
in your fife and smoke it.

236
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,898
What the--

237
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,776
That's Jebediah's
secret confession.

238
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,453
It proves he was a fraud.

239
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,204
"The secret confession

240
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,616
"of Jebediah Springfield.
Know ye who reads..."

241
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,995
Oh. I think, Lisa, that
you've been taken in

242
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,632
by an obvious forgery.

243
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,049
Unfortunately, historical
research is plagued

244
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,458
by this sort of hoax--

245
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,126
the so-called
confession.

246
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:35,264
It's just as phony as
the Howard Hughes will,

247
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,973
the Hitler diaries or
the Emancipation Retraction.

248
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:42,644
But it explains why there's no
record of Jebediah before 1795.

249
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,095
He was Hans Sprungfeld
until then.

250
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,846
That's preposterous.

251
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,557
Now, get out!

252
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,478
You're banned from
this historical society--

253
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:56,197
you and your children and
your children's children.

254
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,030
For three months.

255
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,673
I'm not gonna give up.

256
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,249
I refuse to believe

257
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,884
that everyone refuses
to believe the truth.

258
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,762
I'd like 25 copies
on goldenrod, um,

259
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:21,353
25 on canary, 25 on saffron,

260
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,020
and 25 on paella.

261
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,139
Okay. 100 yellow.

262
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,686
{\an8}You don't have to
help me with this, Dad.

263
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,149
Oh, sure I do.

264
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,229
I always believe in
helping the little guy

265
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,404
and you're the
littlest guy I know.

266
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,573
Question:
Is your name Ridley Scott

267
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,702
or James Cameron?

268
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,988
No, it's Homer.

269
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,321
Then I would thank you

270
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,316
to stop peering
at my screenplay, Homer.

271
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,198
If I see a movie
where computers

272
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,704
threaten our personal liberties,

273
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,196
I will know
that you stole my idea.

274
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,907
I'm just waiting for my kid.

275
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,167
<i>HOMER'S BRAIN:</i>
<i>Mental note: steal his idea.</i>

276
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,803
Hi, Apu.

277
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,299
Can I put this poster
in your window?

278
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,471
Well, of course you can,
you little pixie.

279
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,890
Ooh! You are just as sweet as
the stix which bear your name.

280
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,010
(gasping)
No, no, no.

281
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,018
No, no, no, no.

282
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,099
Take that down.

283
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,603
As a semi-legal immigrant,

284
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,975
your poster could land me
in a predicament

285
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,152
as red hot as the candies
which bear that name.

286
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,026
He wouldn't let
me put it up.

287
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,280
Okay. Well, that's
not gonna stop us.

288
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,992
I know a much better way
to get attention.

289
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,083
Hear ye, hear ye!

290
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,289
My daughter
has something to tell you

291
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,909
about Jebediah Springfield.

292
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,116
Aw! That little cutie
wants to do something cute.

293
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,377
Shut up, you bums, shut up!

294
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,920
Go ahead, angel.

295
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,264
(clearing throat)

296
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,918
Jebediah Springfield
was nothing more

297
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,467
than an evil,
bloodthirsty pirate

298
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,010
who hated this town.

299
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,933
Good God!

300
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,393
Homer,
you know I support

301
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,023
uh, most any prejudice
you can name

302
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,480
but your hero-phobia
sickens me.

303
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,441
You and your daughter
ain't welcome here no more.

304
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,111
Barney, show
them the exit.

305
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,650
There's an exit?

306
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,363
Evil bloodthirsty pirate...

307
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,653
Hello,
Town Jubilation Committee?

308
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,567
I got something that's going
to make you a lot less jubilant.

309
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,656
Can't you understand,
little girl?

310
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,405
Jebediah was no criminal.

311
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,247
That's right.
The reason they say

312
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,462
he had a silver tongue

313
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,671
is because he was
such a fine speaker.

314
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,962
That's a myth that got
mixed up with the truth.

315
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,836
You are tampering with
forces you can't understand.

316
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,474
We have major corporations

317
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,640
sponsoring this event.

318
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,718
I hope you know

319
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,223
you're sponsoring a celebration

320
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,394
for a murderous pirate.

321
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,722
A pirate?

322
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,557
Well, that's hardly
the image we want

323
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,772
for Long John Silver's.

324
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,480
Well, I see no way
of settling this.

325
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,653
I say we imprison them

326
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,731
for the duration
of our Bicentennial.

327
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,727
There is one way.

328
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,148
Get the silver tongue.

329
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,646
If Jebediah's
who I say he is

330
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,487
then it should
still be in his grave.

331
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,912
(murmuring)

332
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,450
I guess, but human
decency prevents--

333
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,656
Dig him up!

334
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,615
Dig up that corpse!

335
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,245
If you really love
Jebediah Springfield

336
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,343
you'll haul his bones
out of the ground

337
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,088
to prove my daughter wrong.

338
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,550
(chanting) Dig up his grave.
Pull out his tongue.

339
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,341
Can't we have one meeting
that doesn't end

340
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,594
with us digging up a corpse?

341
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,363
Now, Lisa,
when you see

342
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,072
there's no silver tongue
in there,

343
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,532
will you stop trying
to ruin Jebediah's reputation?

344
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,913
Yes.

345
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,320
What do we win
if the tongue is there?

346
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,578
Credibility.

347
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,579
Ah, what a gyp.

348
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,289
(gasping)

349
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,798
Jebediah Springfield

350
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,421
has been replaced
with a skeleton.

351
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,047
No, that's the skeleton
of Jebediah.

352
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,845
Gotcha. Gotcha.
Okay, uh...

353
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,139
well, let's start
looking for that silver tongue.

354
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,733

But when you found the truth,
you couldn't take it.

You couldn't stand that you'd
devoted your life to a fraud

434
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,973

-Didn't you?
-No!
