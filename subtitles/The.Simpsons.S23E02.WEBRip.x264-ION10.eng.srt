<i>CHOIR: ♪ The Simpsons ♪</i>

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,209
The Simpsons? Wha...!

3
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:12,223
(exclaiming)

4
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,806
(school bell ringing)

5
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,479
(Barney belches)

6
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,194
(whistle blows)

7
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,324
(yells)

8
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,865
(beeping)

9
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:38,039
(playing the blues)

10
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,048
(tires screeching)

11
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,798
D'oh!

12
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,131
(tires screeching)

13
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,101
Beer!

14
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,351
(assorted cartoon sound effects)

15
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,349
God, I love to watch
that woman get beer.

16
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,781
-(fart)
-(laughing)

17
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,445
You little...!

18
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,373
(blubbering)

19
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,752
D'oh!

20
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,998
(contented blubbering)

21
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:38,715
{\an8}They always come up
with such catchy ways

22
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,847
{\an8}to make us pay
for things we don't need

23
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,194
{\an8}for kids we didn't want.

24
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,240
{\an8}Wow-- the gym ropes
are seaweed,

25
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:56,571
{\an8}the basketball nets
are fishing nets...

26
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,242
{\an8}Yarr! Just plastic.

27
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,247
{\an8}Which is healthier
than what you find in the ocean.

28
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,580
{\an8}Buy a Springfield Elementary
T-shirt?

29
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,587
{\an8}I don't want people to know my
kids go to this lousy school.

30
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,670
{\an8}We also have T-shirts from
other schools.

31
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:15,546
{\an8}Ooh! We can wear those
to the nice mall.

32
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,885
{\an8}(grunting)

33
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,731
{\an8}And now it's time for lights,
camera, auction! (chuckles)

34
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,271
{\an8}No cameras.

35
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,404
{\an8}Ooh, first item up for bid
is always a favorite,

36
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,861
{\an8}lunch with Principal Skinner.

37
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,106
{\an8}I'll just leave the food on your
doorstep and ring the bell.

38
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,448
{\an8}Moving on.

39
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,201
{\an8}Next up for auction
is this wonderful bench

40
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,123
{\an8}hand-crafted
by our second-grade class.

41
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,372
{\an8}Don't buy it.

42
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:45,043
{\an8}I bought one last year
and it was crap construction.

43
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,213
{\an8}Shh.

44
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,381
{\an8}Do I hear $50?

45
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,551
{\an8}Paddles down.

46
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,589
{\an8}It's the only way
to change the system.

47
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,303
{\an8}(phone ringing)

48
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,894
{\an8}Hello?

49
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,259
{\an8}Calling from England?

50
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,095
{\an8}Certainly I can put you
on speakerphone.

51
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,851
{\an8}<i>BART (British lady's voice):</i>
<i>I am Edith Knickertwist,</i>

52
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,143
{\an8}<i>an eccentric widow.</i>

53
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:08,606
{\an8}For this masterpiece, I bid

54
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,688
{\an8}<i>$1,000.</i>

55
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,653
{\an8}-(all gasping)
-Sold.

56
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,114
{\an8}To the mysterious and unverified
Mrs. Knickertwist.

57
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,025
{\an8}Next item:
our school band will play

58
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,953
{\an8}at a function of your choice.

59
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,372
{\an8}<i>I bid $4,000.</i>

60
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,451
{\an8}Well, it looks like
our model solar-system

61
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,036
{\an8}will finally get an Earth.

62
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,247
{\an8}And that concludes
tonight's auction,

63
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:38,338
{\an8}which has raised a school
record $116,000.

64
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,676
{\an8}(cheering)

65
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,301
{\an8}And our windfall is all thanks

66
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,927
{\an8}to our dear new friend
on the phone--

67
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,925
{\an8}'Allo, luvs!

68
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:49,187
{\an8}Mm. I've got a bad feeling
about this.

69
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,810
{\an8}I'm Mrs. Knickertwist.

70
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,277
{\an8}And I've had a proper
hardy-har at your expense.

71
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,779
{\an8}(laughs)

72
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,450
{\an8}Why do I believe everything
I hear in a British accent?

73
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,120
{\an8}He has thrust upon us
the motley of the tomfool.

74
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,702
{\an8}I wore this all night
for nothing?

75
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,997
{\an8}(groans)

76
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,081
{\an8}(angry muttering)

77
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,594
{\an8}Mr. Simpson, I know you're not
one of our wealthier parents,

78
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,091
{\an8}but surely you'll honor
your son's enormous debt.

79
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,513
{\an8}Why, of course.

80
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,971
{\an8}Even if I don't have
a legal obligation to pay,

81
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,103
{\an8}it's clearly the right
thing to do.

82
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,140
Here's $1,000,

83
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:31,095
$2,000, $3,000...

84
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,057
Oh, I need more cash.

85
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,227
Better go to my invisible ATM.

86
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,396
(humming tune)

87
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,065
What? Two dollar charge
for non-network bank?

88
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,204
-Oh!
-(dejected): Oh.

89
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,032
CHALMERS:
Skin-ner!

90
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,537
Yes, sir?

91
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,288
I was very pleased
with your work last night.

92
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,501
-Really?
-Nope. Fooled again.

93
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,001
I'd say you were dumb as a post,

94
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,093
but at least you can put
a sign on a post

95
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,418
that says
"fresh strawberries-- one mile."

96
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,924
You are a nitwit
in an ill-fitting suit.

97
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,877
I'll have you know
I'm lop-shouldered.

98
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,217
I'm sorry, what did you say?

99
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,392
I said, I'm lop-shouldered.

100
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,930
And I have been since
I was hung by my armpits

101
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,555
in a North Vietnamese prison.

102
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,561
I... I didn't know that.

103
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,523
Oh, the list of things
you don't know could fill

104
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,193
a week's worth of morning
announcements,

105
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,402
with enough left over
for a send-home flyer.

106
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,862
There's no need for hyperbole,
Seymour.

107
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,533
If you think it's so easy
to handle Bart Simpson,

108
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,991
why don't you do it yourself?

109
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,911
(cheering)

110
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,620
You tell him, Seymour.

111
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,290
As some guy said
to some dude with a beard,

112
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,249
"Death to tyrants."

113
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,870
You mean Booth
and Lincoln?

114
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,576
I'm not the history teacher.

115
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,127
Anymore.

116
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,880
Fine. I will personally take over
Bart Simpson's education--

117
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:43,474
and for once, that boy
is going to learn something.

118
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,641
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm expecting an important call

119
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,891
and cell phone coverage
in here is, uh, spotty.

120
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,685
Oh, nicely done, Seymour.

121
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,440
I guess there's some stones
in your leaf bag after all.

122
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,192
While I'm on a roll,
I'm gonna call

123
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,444
that carpet cleaning service

124
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,315
and tell them our hallway
doesn't count as a room.

125
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,664
Hello, is André there?

126
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,241
Oh, yes, I'll hold.

127
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,076
I know I can superintend--
superintend like the wind--

128
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,836
but teach?
It's been years.

129
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,669
And we both know how that went,
don't we, Gary?

130
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,637
So, you are the so-called
Breakfast Club.

131
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,599
Wrong room.
We're the Fight Club.

132
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,060
<i>♪ Don't you ♪</i>

133
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,561
<i>♪ Forget about me ♪</i>

134
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,725
<i>♪ Don't, don't, don't, don't ♪</i>

135
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,114
<i>♪ Don't you... ♪</i>

136
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,321
Thank God they never went on
to do anything since.

137
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:48,324
So, Simpson, you'll be
studying with me now.

138
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,488
Same garbage,
different Dumpster.

139
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:54,076
We'll start with
American history.

140
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,333
Now, I'm sure you know
who these gentlemen are.

141
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,206
{\an8}BART: Dollar bill guy,
five dollar bill guy,

142
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:02,173
{\an8}sex guy, Will Ferrell,
black guy.

143
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,505
(sighs)

144
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,886
Bart, what if I told you
there was a president

145
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,851
who was an actual cowboy?

146
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,351
I'd act like I'm interested,
but inside I'd be bored.

147
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,944
That's as good a place
to start as any.

148
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,939
{\an8}<i>THEODORE ROOSEVELT:</i>
<i>...great fundamental issue</i>

149
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,111
{\an8}<i>now before our people...</i>

150
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,780
<i>...can be stated briefly.</i>

151
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,952
<i>It is, are the American people</i>
<i>fit to govern themselves,</i>

152
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,201
<i>to rule themselves,</i>
<i>to control themselves.</i>

153
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:35,624
<i>I believe they are.</i>
<i>My opponents do not.</i>

154
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,665
Hey, this Roosevelt guy
was sort of interesting.

155
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,999
Did you know he was
a colonel in the army?

156
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,835
You don't say.

157
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,050
And one time, during a speech,
he was shot by a saloon-keeper,

158
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,722
but Teddy finished his speech
before heading to the hospital.

159
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,932
Aha! I'm mad at you
for some reason.

160
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,937
(people chanting)
Teddy, Teddy, Teddy...

161
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:08,646
I've never said this before,
but I'd like to learn more.

162
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,498
{\an8}Man, Teddy Roosevelt killed
more Spaniards in one day

163
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,713
{\an8}than most people do
in their whole lives.

164
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,843
You know,
I hate to say this, Bart,

165
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,051
but the library is about to close.

166
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,381
Really? I wanted to learn
more about trust busting.

167
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,138
Take that, Standard Oil.

168
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,310
Tomorrow, son.
Tomorrow.

169
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,178
Well, I've learned
a lot today.

170
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:39,265
Now, to go home and let TV
slowly rot it all away.

171
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,062
Eh-eh-eh.
Not so fast.

172
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,605
Teddy Roosevelt believed
you could learn from books.

173
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,609
But he also believed
you can learn

174
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,991
just as much
from the out-of-doors.

175
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,739
I thought teachers only went
outdoors to smoke and cry.

176
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,321
Yes.

177
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:56,406
Son, have you ever seen a horse
your father wasn't betting on?

178
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,584
-No, sir.
-Come with me.

179
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,167
(Chalmers laughing heartily)

180
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,830
(whinnying)

181
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,588
So, Bart, what have
you learned so far?

182
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,591
Well, when horses poop,
they don't stop.

183
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,423
-They just keep walking.
-Yes, yes.

184
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,888
Well, here's another
fun fact for you.

185
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,429
All around you
is a national park

186
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,143
created by Teddy Roosevelt.

187
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,314
Mm!

188
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,892
Wow!

189
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,267
And here I thought
God created all this.

190
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,904
Thanks for
setting me straight.

191
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,691
Well, wait,
I didn't mean that.

192
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,494
You've filled my head
with horse poop and atheism.

193
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,109
And all these years,
I thought I was unteachable.

194
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,696
Let's stop talking now.

195
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:38,412
"A man who is good enough
to shed his blood for the country

196
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,914
is good enough to be given
a square deal afterwards."

197
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,128
Just quoting
our 26th president, Lis.

198
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,128
You could use a little T.R.
in your life.

199
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,880
Please. I went through
my T.R. phase in first grade.

200
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:53,474
Now I realize that the greatest
Roosevelt is Franklin.

201
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,511
Balderdash!

202
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,144
Teddy Roosevelt protected
America's wildlife.

203
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,271
Yeah, so he could
shoot it himself.

204
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,928
Franklin Roosevelt
led this country

205
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,977
through the Depression
and World War II.

206
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,610
-Face on a dime!
-Face on a mountain!

207
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,318
I hated the "Roosie-velts"
and all them family dynasties.

208
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,570
The Kennedys, the Bushes,
Jon Voight and Angelina Jolie,

209
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,994
Mayor Daley and his smart-ass son,
<i>The Daily Show.</i>

210
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,084
That's a lot of anger,
Grampa.

211
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,040
Well, I like Stephen Colbert,

212
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,080
but that's because
I don't get the joke.

213
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,250
And on July 1st, 1898,

214
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,054
Colonel Theodore Roosevelt
and his band of Rough Riders

215
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,128
charged up San Juan Hill
and liberated Cuba.

216
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,844
<i>Cuba si!</i>
<i>Castro no!</i>

217
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:38,385
I love Teddy Roosevelt because
he had asthma as a boy.

218
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,811
I love him because
he said, "Bully."

219
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,060
The dude really knew
how to rock some jodhpurs.

220
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,943
Hey, maybe Chalmers would let
you guys sit in on our lessons.

221
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,901
After me, men.

222
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,901
(chanting)
Bully-bully-bully-bully-bully!

223
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,952
I'd be glad to have you boys

224
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,739
join our experiment
in manly education.

225
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,077
The fact is,
today's modern schools

226
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,911
have completely failed you.

227
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,786
School failed me?

228
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,673
Does school have
to go to summer Jimbo?

229
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,801
(groans, sighs)
Look at him, boys.

230
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:14,418
He is the canary in the
coal mine of a dying empire.

231
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,677
You're in my coal mine
now, bitches!

232
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Yeah. Boys are falling
behind in every subject,

233
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,806
because our classrooms
are entirely geared towards girls!

234
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:29,192
It's all about feelings,
and celebrating differences.

235
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:32,021
But I loved reading
<i>It's Cool to Cry!</i>

236
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,528
Well, it's not cool to cry!

237
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,189
(sobs)

238
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,947
Boys need to explore!
Build things!

239
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,700
Wreck those things!
And then build them again!

240
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,123
Our first lesson begins
this Saturday,

241
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,962
with an overnight trip
to Springfield Forest.

242
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,879
Legend has it that Teddy Roosevelt
visited the forest

243
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,879
and lost a pair
of his trademark spectacles.

244
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,382
This weekend, we set forth
in search of those spectacles!

245
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,875
(all cheer)

246
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,337
This is all well and good,

247
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,807
but I must know:
what are spectacles?

248
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,138
Glasses.

249
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,684
One time,

250
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,557
I found an old
washing machine over there

251
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,984
that still had clothes in it.

252
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:10,982
ALL:
Wow.

253
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,863
This place is as beautiful

254
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,740
as the side
of a Coors beer can.

255
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,608
The kind my Dad used to leave
in the bathtub.

256
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,236
There are no bad fathers
in the wilderness, boy.

257
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,493
(growls)

258
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,655
(grunts)

259
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,212
(owl hoots)

260
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,673
Hmm?

261
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,590
You know, Bart,

262
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,425
morning is when I miss
my Rosemary the most.

263
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,181
She sure looked good
in a pair of jammies.

264
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,684
(chuckles)

265
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,024
NELSON:
Dinguses! Dinguses!

266
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,863
Huh?

267
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:53,858
(groans)

268
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:59,033
I found 'em!
Teddy Roosevelt's spectacles!

269
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,361
Ah, nicely done, Muntz!

270
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,947
Could this be the moment
my life starts to turn around?

271
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,624
The moment I... (gasps)

272
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,618
Gravity blows!

273
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,956
Gary, you took these boys
on an unauthorized field trip,

274
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,456
and look what happened!

275
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,417
He got some bumps
and bruises

276
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,878
and a thistle
in his britches.

277
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,467
What is the big deal?

278
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,062
The big deal is
I'm gonna sue you!

279
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,768
Got me one of them "abogados"
from the bus ads.

280
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,729
He said he'll only take
<i>"veinte por ciento,"</i>

281
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,401
whatever that is.

282
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,319
(Spanish accent) You have seen
my picture on the side of a bus.

283
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,608
And I am not smiling
because I <i>lost</i> the case.

284
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:40,823
NELSON:
Ha-ha!

285
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:44,243
I'm gonna take you
for every peso you got.

286
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,583
How did she know
we get paid in pesos?

287
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,749
They took my job away, boys.

288
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,462
Where to, boss?

289
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,837
Just drive.

290
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,473
(tires squeal)

291
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,760
(grunts)

292
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,680
Maybe it is cool to cry.

293
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,354
(sobs softly)

294
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,607
Who can name
the three types of rocks?

295
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,533
Bart Simpson?

296
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:26,121
Chalmers would actually
take us out to see the rocks.

297
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,118
You can see the rocks on page 32
of your science book.

298
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,951
My book is missing page 32.

299
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,616
Put your head on the desk
and shut your eyes.

300
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,116
My desktop is sticky with soda

301
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,627
from the kid
that had it before me.

302
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,629
Do as I say!

303
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,550
(groans)

304
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,007
(kids clamoring)

305
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,630
(grunting)

306
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,692
-(grunts)
-Stupid fish!

307
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,808
Don't you want to be
my din-ner?!

308
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,396
-Hey, Gary.
-(sighs)

309
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,741
Simpson, you are looking at a man
who was not good enough

310
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,398
for the worst
public school in America.

311
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,737
Well, what would
Teddy Roosevelt do?

312
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,913
Son, I'm no Teddy Roosevelt.

313
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,662
I'm not even
Kermit Roosevelt.

314
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,504
(gasps)

315
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,170
I call this meeting of the Brotherhood
of the Spectacles to order.

316
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,131
Our mission:
to get Chalmers back his job.

317
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,962
ALL:
Hear, hear! Hear, hear!

318
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:28,678
Bart, I want to ask you about
something I read in a magazine.

319
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,431
Are you boys cyberbullying
each other?

320
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,773
How could we be?

321
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,518
We're all in the same place
and we don't have computers.

322
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,484
Marge, I parented!

323
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,112
That's great, Homie!

324
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,269
Come have some
ice cream on a brownie!

325
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,108
Later, losers.

326
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,363
I'm thinking of something big.

327
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:49,784
So big it involves taking over
the entire school...

328
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,985
and not giving it up till
Chalmers gets his job back!

329
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,207
(sighs) Bart, your mother thinks there's
something suspicious

330
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,578
about all you boys having
a meeting in this tree house.

331
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,086
Well, Dad, since you are
taking an interest in us,

332
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,498
maybe I should tell you...

333
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,876
Oh! Marge,
my ice cream's melting

334
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,224
and I haven't finished
my brownie!

335
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,179
Come in and get
some more!

336
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,179
You guys need to get a woman.

337
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,600
So, I'm considering
taking drugs.

338
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:20,064
Would the school advise
for or against that?

339
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,555
Oh, strongly against!

340
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,107
Would you like
to read this pamphlet?

341
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,110
Hmm...

342
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:28,202
Uh, well, would you
read it with me?

343
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,488
(giggles) Oh!

344
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:34,162
You see, this boy took drugs
and his scores suffered.

345
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,873
(chuckles) Yeah...

346
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,383
(snoring)

347
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,172
There's a car with its lights on

348
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,127
<i>in the teachers' lot.</i>

349
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,177
(gasps)

350
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:56,181
<i>Late-'90s model,</i>
<i>coffee stains on front seat,</i>

351
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,595
<i>stacks of résumés in backseat.</i>

352
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,526
Bart, what are you doing?

353
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,034
Taking over the school
with all the kids inside.

354
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,197
What?!
I'm telling Mom.

355
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,786
Great. You can call her
from the closet phone.

356
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,082
Hello, Mom?

357
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,285
You won't believe
what Bart's doing.

358
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,125
There really is
a phone in there?

359
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,963
(scoffs)
So immature.

360
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,757
Yo, teachwads!

361
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,513
<i>The Brotherhood</i>
<i>of the Spectacles has</i>

362
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,755
<i>taken over the school!</i>

363
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,386
Oh, no, please.

364
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,183
Don't make us start
our weekend early.

365
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,476
Our paychecks are
in there.

366
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,189
(screams)

367
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,769
Why didn't I sign up
for direct deposit?!

368
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,688
Bart, open this door now,

369
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,107
or I will jiggle the handle
indefinitely!

370
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,066
Suit yourself.
We all rubbed it with boogers.

371
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,566
Damn!

372
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,407
Willie, break it down.

373
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,958
NELSON:
Not so fast!

374
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,462
Back it up
or the photocopier eats it!

375
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,134
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

376
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,963
We've got a 30-year mortgage
on that photocopier!

377
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,048
Willie, stay your tractor!

378
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:16,553
Ye can't just turn her on
and off like that!

379
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,514
(engine stops)

380
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,807
Oh, I guess you can.

381
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,310
Okay, we gotta
stay focused:

382
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,311
Jimbo, gather all
the students in the gym.

383
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,813
Milhouse, take a nap.
You know how cranky you get.

384
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,056
I do not!

385
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,361
(siren whoops)

386
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,533
(tires screech)

387
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,370
<i>MAN (over P.A.):</i>
<i>Watch </i>Hannity<i> tonight at 8:00.</i>

388
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,870
Dog Day After School?!

389
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,543
This is Kent Brockman outside
Springfield Elementary

390
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,922
with the parents of lockdown
leader Bart Simpson.

391
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,999
He's not a bad boy.

392
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,455
He had a teacher
who finally got through to him,

393
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,836
and they fired him.

394
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,342
HOMER:
Are you covering me up?!

395
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,883
Yes, I'm afraid we are.

396
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,637
The least I can get out of
this whole nightmare

397
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,428
is some face time
on the local news.

398
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,852
It's kind of my way of
sending a Christmas card.

399
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,271
Happy Holidays,
everyone!

400
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,429
Family's fine!

401
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,937
Dude, you better
see this.

402
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,018
Attention, Brotherhood
of the Spectacles:

403
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,107
you are ordered to immediately
evacuate the school,

404
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,613
and then return
to school where you belong.

405
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,276
I need to know that Chalmers
will be taken care of!

406
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,735
We don't negotiate
with terrorists!

407
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,156
Or the people that supply
our uniforms and weapons.

408
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,955
We just pay
whatever they say.

409
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,828
Let me talk to the boy!

410
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,495
(grunts)

411
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,174
It's time for you
to stand down, son.

412
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,263
When I met you,
you were nothing more

413
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,418
than a thick file
of infractions.

414
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:39,677
Now I see a young man I'm proud
to call my disciplinary problem.

415
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,561
Thanks. But these Rough Riders
aren't dismounting

416
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,019
until you get your job back.

417
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,679
What do you think, Chief?

418
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,687
Can we take the building
without hurting anybody?

419
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,689
Well, if a group of Muppets
can take Manhattan...

420
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,231
-(gun fires)
-Aah! Aah!

421
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,855
-Job restored!
-Increase in title?

422
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,942
Fine, fine.
You're super-duper-intendent.

423
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,068
That's all I ever wanted.

424
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,525
No hard feelings?

425
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,195
Nothing but hard feelings,
Seymour.

426
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,622
(kids cheering)

427
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,376
It's beautiful, man!

428
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,380
It's beautiful!

429
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,462
Oh, my God.

430
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,716
Milhouse, did you take your nap?

431
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,798
Does it look like I took my nap?

432
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,054
(laughs crazily)

433
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,890
BART:
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

434
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:27,392
Sir, of all the books and movies
about Teddy Roosevelt,

435
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,136
which would you say
is the most informative?

436
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,188
-No question: <i>Night at the Museum.</i>
-One or two?

437
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,022
Take your pick,
you can't go wrong.

438
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,737
-(murmuring)
-Shh!

439
