00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,166
Bart, you have to treat girls
like they matter,

173
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,377
not like they're a bunch of Milhice.

174
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,927
What? It's the plural of Milhouse.
Look it up.

175
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,931
Listen to your sister, boy.

176
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,773
What I'm saying
applies to you, too, Dad.

177
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,060
What are you talkin' about?

178
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,353
Marge and I are goin' great.

179
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,901
Homer Simpson!

180
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,570
Did you take Maggie to Moe's?

181
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,818
It was during Happy Hour.

182
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,569
Don't you want our baby to be happy?

183
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,991
Don't you see?

184
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,739
You're taking women for granted.

185
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,571
And aside from being lumped
together and generalized about,

186
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,577
it's the one thing all women hate.

187
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,080
(scoffs) How can something
that applies to Bart apply to me?

188
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,214
I'm so much older and wiser.

189
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,421
More like balder and wider.

190
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,711
Why you little... I'll teach you

191
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,415
to say something that sounds similar!

192
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,467
♪♪

193
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,265
-(applauding)
-Thank you, last contestant.

194
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:58,519
Tomorrow we will feature
the no-longer racist country comedy

195
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,113
of Barry the Satellite TV Guy.

196
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,279
Isn't it funny how all people
are of equal worth?

197
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:07,528
Please do not boycott
my line of power tools.

198
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,652
(laughs)

199
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,818
Now all Barry's jokes
are about his ex-wife.

200
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,487
No, they ain't. We're back together.

201
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,285
Then you got no act.

202
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:17,458
(chuckles)
And now, the winner is...

203
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,038
(drumroll)

204
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,131
Devon Peacock!

205
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,300
I can finally get my suspender buckled!

206
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,800
(cheering)

207
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,803
Looks like we got a feud
with the Peacocks now.

208
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,465
Uh-huh.

209
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,555
All I care is what you think, Bart.

210
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,641
(whispers) Compliment her.

211
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,436
<i>BART:</i>
<i>I don't know what she wants.</i>

212
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,520
<i>What would my heroes say?</i>

213
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,065
Slash her face now, Bart.

214
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,858
Slash it while she least expects it.

215
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,902
{\an8}Bart, tell Mary to play the drums...

216
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,895
{\an8}the only thing anyone
listens to in any band.

217
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,987
<i>It's hard to pick just one of those.</i>

218
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,743
{\an8}Bart, you'd better get your act together.

219
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,544
{\an8}And me, too.

220
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,328
{\an8}I've gotta get these shirts
to the dry cleaners.

221
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,331
{\an8}They close at 6:00.

222
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,963
Bart Simpson, you get out of that

223
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,960
gosh-darned fugue state this instant.

224
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,502
Lift my spirits!

225
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,335
Um... lifting people's spirits

226
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,880
is an interesting topic.

227
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,724
For centuries, Neanderthal
and astronaut alike

228
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,590
have enjoyed lifting spirits.

229
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,427
You're givin' me book report talk.

230
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,103
Excuse me, I am
a Brazilian record producer.

231
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,312
I concentrate in the rapidly-growing

232
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,193
jug band-samba fusion market.

233
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,940
Oh, my God! Do you know
Billy-Bobaloo Skeeter-Rodriguez?

234
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:29,533
Know him? Before he was famous,
he kidnapped my mother!

235
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,700
Mary, would you like
to have dinner with me

236
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,819
and my handsome, girl-crazy son tonight?

237
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,286
I am the first boy
to get my own liquor ad.

238
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,538
(Latin guitar music plays)

239
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,710
Bart, you want to come with us?

240
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,419
I need you.

241
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,589
Mary, we've just been through
three hours of music.

242
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,958
Usually, I only have music
one hour a week,

243
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:51,085
and the teacher spends it reading
real estate listings for Fire Island.

244
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,633
I'll see you later, Bart.

245
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,547
Mary, are you okay?

246
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,885
Sure. Everything's fine.

247
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,929
At that moment, I had a vision

248
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,426
of every time in my life

249
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,937
an angry woman would say
"Everything's fine."

250
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,572
I guess it's just me and the dog.

251
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,278
(groans)

252
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,373
Everything's fine.

253
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,078
Now.

254
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,540
(whistling)

255
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,514
Melvis? Where's Mary?

256
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,803
I brung you regrets from my sister.

257
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,057
She has been de-avoidably untained.

258
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,930
(groans) Am I getting dumped?

259
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,518
Okay, Bart, maybe you blew it
by taking Mary for granted.

260
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,105
Woman are life's great mystery, along with

261
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,071
why do they give you salt and
pepper at a Chinese restaurant?

262
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,992
But if you want one more shot,

263
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,121
I know a date that will turn
this mighty Aphrodite

264
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,449
into your purple rose of Cairo.

265
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,414
Those are movies I made.

266
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,286
It's my oeuvre.

267
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,713
It sounds dirty, but it's not.

268
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,129
<i>(speaking in French)</i>

269
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,804
(snoring)

270
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,886
Everyone's fast asleep.

271
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,471
It's like my second wedding night,

272
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,976
except more walkouts
and there were no refunds.

273
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,559
Gee...

274
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,064
(couples moaning)

275
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,316
Can I see you tomorrow night?

276
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,399
Sure, I'll be here
with my other boyfriend.

277
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,824
He's watching us now.

278
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,572
BOY: Oh, boy.

279
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,406
Okay, Luann, it's all settled.

280
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,951
We're gonna ditch Milhouse.

281
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,584
Bart, I think it's best
if we take a break.

282
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,213
Good idea, I can chuck
eggs at the other couples.

283
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,210
Just hug me, dummy.

284
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,549
Back pats?

285
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,894
This is a breakup.

286
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,429
You'll be fine.
There's a pot for every possum.

287
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,977
Give me another chance.

288
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,190
I'll be way more attentive
to your needs on the seesaw.

289
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,191
I'll stay down there
for as long as you want.

290
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,903
Sorry, Bart, I'm a hillbilly girl of 13.

291
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,614
If I'm not married
in the next few months,

292
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,244
nobody's gonna want me.

293
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,860
Not even old Joe Clabby.

294
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,157
Hey, you're a pretty
little thing, you are,

295
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,661
but ticktock, ticktock.

296
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,834
Good-bye, Bart.

297
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,662
Aw, sweetie.

298
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,878
I told you this would happen
if you dated outside the family.

299
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,249
Mm-mm-mm.

300
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,094
-(groans)
-Move along, relationship's over.

301
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,383
(groans)

302
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,756
Sure do like forcing
people to leave areas.

303
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,683
Yeah.

304
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,270
MARGE:
I was the only one without a date

305
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,688
at Patty's new lady friend's
travel bookstore soft opening.

306
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,099
You told me it was up to me
if I wanted to go.

307
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,608
You should know that me saying
I don't care

308
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,690
means I couldn't care more.

309
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,276
I am sick and tired of trying
to decode you like you're some

310
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,242
kind of human being separate from myself.

311
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,624
Bart, would you go to your room

312
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,620
while your father and I
finish our little talk?

313
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,502
Little talk?
You guys are having a big fight.

314
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,500
This is the problem with women--
they don't say

315
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,422
what they mean until it's too late!

316
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,881
All right, fine.

317
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,090
If you boys want it,
I'll tell you what I really think.

318
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,262
Finally, we're getting somewhere.

319
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,295
You're both in the doghouse,

320
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:27,095
which is misleading
'cause I still like the dog.

321
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,431
(sighs)

322
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,016
Hand me my suitcase, boy.

323
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,151
When do I get a Krusty suitcase?

324
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,859
When you're older.

325
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,318
So this is where you go
when Mom kicks you out?

326
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,485
You're saying it
like it happens all the time.

327
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,124
And by the way,
the paint's a little faded

328
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,622
on my parking spot.

329
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,293
You call this a platinum club experience?

330
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,873
We'll get right on it, Mr. Simpson.

331
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,378
I told you a thousand times,
call me Homer!

332
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,759
Oh, what's this notice on the wall?

333
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,130
Standard hotel boilerplate.

334
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,546
It just says somebody died
in this room in the last 72 hours.

335
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,676
Aw, man, we just missed it.

336
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,523
(laughs) Oh, it'll happen again, son.

337
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,428
Um, I've got to make a phone call.

338
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,727
Eh, knock yourself out.

339
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,941
D'oh!

340
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,190
Not again.

341
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,322
(touch tones beeping)

342
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,026
Mary? Ooh, that's odd.

343
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,150
I thought I was calling
the Suicide Not Line,

344
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,987
because I'm doing great.

345
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,452
So, um, how are you
handling taking a break?

346
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,874
Great. Turns out Adele was right.

347
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,714
Ain't nothing better for songwriting

348
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,879
than when your relationship
takes a bolt to the brain.

349
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,249

(groans)

368
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,892
I had this idea years ago,

369
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,187
but your mother wouldn't let me do it.

370
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,230

371
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,654
It's hurting my eyes!

372

(gasps)

373
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,160
It's so great here--
no wife to get mad at you

374
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,660
for closing your laptop whenever
they walk into the room.

375
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,953
Or getting your kid hooked on pot.

376
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,457
She's my kid, too, you know.

377
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,463
You know what we need?

378
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,961
A classic "kicked out of the house" party.

379
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,634
Now, who's got a rocking CD?

380
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,632
I've got the audio book
of Robert Caro's <i>The Passage of Power.</i>

381
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:07,965
That's it?

382
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,550
Well, then let's "power" this party up.

383
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,135
<i>ROBERT CARO (on tape):</i>
<i>Air Force One,</i>

<i>the crew's cockpit</i>
<i>into three compartments.</i>

386
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,769
<i>In the first of them,</i>

387
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,525
<i>women sat weeping</i>
<i>and Secret Service agents</i>

388

389
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,028
<i>"You've heard of strong men crying?</i>

<i>Well, we had it there that day,"</i>
<i>recalls a reporter.</i>

391
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,033
<i>As the pilot lifted the big jet</i>
<i>off the Dallas runway,</i>

392
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,448
<i>in a climb so steep that to a man...</i>

393
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,997
I miss Mary.

394
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,370
I miss Roxie.

395
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,876
That's the club where I used
to smoke pot with my kid.

396
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,289
This calls for decisive action.

397
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,958
Like LBJ's use of the period
of mourning following

398
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,467
the assassination
to push through the Civil Rights Act.

399
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,640
But how do we figure out what to do?

400
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,389
The same way Hollywood does.

401
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,470
By watching British movies.

402
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,806

Hard to believe that country used

Agreed, but to win back our women,

416
