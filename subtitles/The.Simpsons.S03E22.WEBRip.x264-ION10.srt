180
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,292
Maybe I should go.

181
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,127
No, that's okay,
you can stay.

182
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,223
You can read comics with us.

183
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,928
Let's see,
something for the lady...

184
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,969
Ah-- "Radioactive Man
vs. The Swamp Hag".

185
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,465
Got any girl comics

186
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,926
like "Bonnie Crane,
Girl Attorney,"

187
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,637
"Punkin and Dunkin,
the Twinkle Twins,"

188
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,977
or "Li'l Knee Socks"?

189
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,784
No, but my sister's
got a wide selection

190
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,148
of crappy comics.

191
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,738

192
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,782

I'll trade your
Carl Yastrzemski baseball card

230
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,601
for my Omar Vzocel.
Deal.

231
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,396
Next on the trading block,
your Mickey Mantle, 1958,

232
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,440
for my picture
of Homer on the couch.

233
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,317
Milhouse, I've got to go.

234
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,322
My dad thinks I'm having
my braces examined.

235
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,405
Well, you kind of
sort of are.

236
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,044
Milhouse, we're living
in the age of cooties.

237
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,035
I can't believe
the risk you're running.

238
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,587
Besides, what's so great
about kissing?

239
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,342
Bart, it's not
just the kissing.

240
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,763
A lot of it is
waiting to kiss.

241
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,512
You know, like when you
open an Eskimo Pie

242
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,465
and you wait just a
little bit for it to melt?

243
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,926
But she doesn't melt.

244
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,186
Oh, yes, she does.

245
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,978
<i>WOMAN: We start with pure</i>

<i>...and dip it</i>
<i>in rich creamery butter.</i>

252
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,079
Dad, what if I told you
you could lose weight

253
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,963
without dieting
or lifting a finger?

254
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,541
I'd say you're
a lying scumbag.

255
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,746
Why, sweetie?

256
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,706
According to Eternity magazine

257
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,006
you can lose weight through
subliminal learning.

258
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,720
That's where an idea is
subtly implanted in your head

259
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,511
without you even knowing it.

260
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,974
Oh, Lisa, that's a load
of rich creamery butter.

261
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,675
They'll send you tapes
you listen to

262
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:05,925
while you sleep.

263
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,386
As you hear new age music,

264
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,596
a powerful message
goes to your brain

265
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,107
telling you to eat less.

266
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,608
Lose weight and listen
to new age music? Wow.

267
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,362
What do you think, Marge?

268
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,824
Oh, Homer, I love you
just the way you are.

269
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,615
Lisa, what's that number?

270
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,579
Operator, I'd like to place
an order for my husband.

271
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,910

stop smoking,

272
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,536
learn the state capitals,
master hostage negotiations...

273
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,964
Hmm... hostage negotiations.

274
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:37,924
Listen, Tabbouleh, we're
ignoring all your demands.

275
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,717

277
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,466

the weight loss tape.

00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,725
as spending
too much time together.

355
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,364
Oh, fine.

356
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,530
I'm tired of watching
you two lip wrestle.

357
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,449
There's plenty of other ways
to be grossed out in this town.

358
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,950
(sobbing)

359
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,163
-Bart, wait.
-Yeah?

360
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,453
Uh...

361
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,076
could we still use
your tree house?

362
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,962
What? Get bent.

363
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,829
If her father catches us,
he'll kill her.

364
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,537
All right, Milhouse.

365
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,167
{\an8}You can use my tree house.

366
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,094
Thanks, Bart.

367
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,432
(singsongy)
Samantha and Milhouse sitting in a tree,

368
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,429
about to lose
their privacy.

369
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,392
(fiendish laughter)

370
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,440
(touch tones)

371
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,980
Now there's a
Machiavellian countenance.

372
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,484
Ooh, a sextet of ale!

373
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,071
Hello, Mr. Stanky?

374
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,073
I have some shocking news
about your daughter Samantha.

375
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,945
Who am I?

376
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,782
Let's just say I'm
a concerned prude

377
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,987
with a lot of time on his hands.

378
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,197
(kissing sounds)

379
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,458
I bet you had peanut butter
for breakfast.

380
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,751
(laughs)

381
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,424
Yeah.

382
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,752
-Samantha!
-Dad!

383
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,337
Noooooo!

384
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,302
Samantha, you're my little girl

385
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,554
and sometimes my imagination
runs away with me.

386
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,556
Just-- Just tell me
what happened.

387
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,558
-Well, Milhouse and I--
-That's enough!

388
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,140
I'm putting you in
an all-girl school.

389
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,806
You're never going to see
that boy again.

390
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,056
Milhouse!

391
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,937
Samantha!

392
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,442
(weeping)

393
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,397
Well, Milhouse, 'tis better
to have loved and lost...

394
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,658
yadda, yadda, yadda.

395
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,069
Let's go to the arcade.

396
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,487
How could this happen?

397
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,575
We started out
like Romeo and Juliet

398
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,410
but it ended up
in tragedy.

399
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,077
<i>Hierospacy:</i>
<i>Predicting the future</i>

400

<i>of animal entrails.</i>

401
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,625
Dad! Do you know
what today is?

402
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:09,882
The vernal equinox?

403
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,263
No, it's two weeks

404
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,220
since you got that
subliminal weight-loss tape.

405
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,890
Let's get you on the scale.

406
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,808
You've gained 13 pounds.

407
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,849
Disingenuous mountebanks with
their subliminal chicanery--

408
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,555
A pox on them!

409
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,229
There stands a broken man.

410
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,686
It's recess everywhere
but in his heart.

411
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,486
Hey, Bart, according
to this magazine

412
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,031
in another million years

413
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,825
man will have
an extra finger.

414
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,328
Five fingers?
Ooh-- Freak show!

415
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,210
Listen, Lis, I need some
advice and Mom's not here.

416
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,038
-Why didn't you go to Dad?
-I did,

417
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,384
but I couldn't understand
what the hell he was saying.

418
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,838
Lisa, I feel terrible.

419
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,668
I ratted on my best friend

420
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,463
and he doesn't even know
I did it.

421
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,047
Well, according to
Eternity magazine

422
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,473
the feeling of guilt
has been linked

423
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,641
to the neural-transmitter
gamephenomene.

424
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,259
Dow chemical is developing
a minty gel

425
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,266
which will eliminate
excess guilt,

426
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,768
but unfortunately
it won't be on the market

427
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,430
for another six months,

428
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,348
so I guess you're gonna
have to bite the bullet

429
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,266
and confess to Milhouse.

430
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,065
(groans)

431
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,109
Bart, I'm glad you're here.

432
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,402
Milhouse could use
a friend like you.

433
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,816
(nervous laugh)

434
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,235
(sobbing)

435
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,703
Milhouse?

436
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,163
Bart, I didn't want you
to see me cry.

437
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,374
Oh, come on.

438
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,543
I've seen you cry
a million times.

439
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,081
You cry when
you scrape your knee.

440
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,875
You cry when they're out
of chocolate milk.

441
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,288
You cry when you're doing
long division

442
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,786
and you have
a remainder left over.

443
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:34,588
Well, I didn't want you
to see me cry this time.

444
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,093
Listen, Milhouse, I got
a confession to make.

445
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,676
I'm the one who narked
on your kissing.

446
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,801
What?!

447
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,008

find her?
