175
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,787
Well, sometimes people
who agree on most things

176
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,423
have one issue that
they disagree strongly about.

177
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,420
In politics,
it's called a wedge issue,

178
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,632
like illegal immigration
or gay marriage.

179
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,133
Wait a minute.

180
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,134
Can I play them
against each other

181
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,636
so I don't have to do
any homework at all?

182
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,849
You would mess up
Mom and Dad's marriage

183
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,019
just to get out
of doing some homework?

184
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,348
Hey, hey, I would end
all life on this planet

185
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,984
just to get out of
doing fractions.

186
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,650
Fractions aren't that hard.

187
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,649
You just have to find
a common denominator.

188
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,281
For example, one half
plus one third equals...

189
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:07,568
End... all... life...
on... this... planet!

190
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,993
(imitates explosion)

191
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,782
You'll need to know fractions
to make that explosion!

192
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,197
I don't care.

193
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,257
Oh, so much homework.

194
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,880
Childhood slipping away.

195
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,347
(grunting)

196
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,808
Bart, put down those books
and go play this instant.

197
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,270
If you say so.

198
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,519
(grunts)

199
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,065
Right on time.

00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:47,488

00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,834
Dear Lord, please give
my stubborn husband

205
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,871
the wisdom to see that
I am right as usual.

206
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,496
Too late, Marge.

207
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,832
I already used a prayer block
on your prayer.

208
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,748
There's no such thing
as prayer blocks.

209
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,506
Yeah, right.

Hmm. No line,

00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,121
I see no reason
to question your choice.

234
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,750
Smooth move, Mom,
tricking Dad into having lunch

235
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,085
at the one place
that doesn't serve beer.

236
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,841
What the...? Then I want to eat
at... Moe's Express.

237
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,303
By express, I mean

238
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,473
that you express
your anger and hatred.

239
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,142
The last time
you ate there,

240
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,180
you spent three nights
in the mall jail.

241
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,774
That was last week,
and you're still bringing it up.

242
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,310
Well, you always miss

243
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,853
when you throw your underpants
at the hamper.

244
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,936
Well, how could I ever
hit the hamper

245
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,152
if you don't let me practice?

246
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,231
You practiced all day
on my birthday.

247
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,687
Fine. I was gonna apologize,
but now I'm not going to.

248
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,278
You were never going
to apologize.

249
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,203
I was, too.
The words were in my brain.

250
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,821
You're wrong,
and whenever you're wrong,

251
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,198
you just spout gibberish.

252
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:03,504
(shouting gibberish)

253
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,421
Congratulations.

254
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,801
You're officially a sociopath.

255
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,588
Hey, at least
I'm on a path.

256
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,302
I don't mind if you
pee in the shower,

257
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,012
but only if you're
taking a shower.

258
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,472
No freedom.

259
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,431
I have no freedom
around this house.

260
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,852
After sex,
I'm not talking to you.

261
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,891
Well, then there
won't be any sex.

262
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:27,444
You can't sex fire me,
I sex quit.

263
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,531

264
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,902

<i>The next morning is where</i>
<i>the fight is won or lost.</i>

266
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,655
<i>Freeze him out.</i>

267
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,491
<i>It's cold in Marge's</i>
<i>doghouse, baby.</i>

268
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,419
I just think
when two people disagree,

269
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,918
the big jerk ought to apologize.

270
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,840
You know, Marge, (sighs)

271
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,459
Maude and I had a fight
right before she died.

272
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,047
Neddy, when you're
drying your hands

273
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,433
with our monogrammed
towels,

274
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,639
can you use the "NF"
towel, not the "MF"?

275
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,771
You know, maybe I should use
a towel marked "BDD"--

276
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,099
big diddily deal.

277
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,693
(gasps)

278
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:11,268
I play that fight over in
my mind a thousand times a day.

279
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,488
(muttering):
Must win fight. Must win fight.

280
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,950
(crowd cheering)

281
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,359
{\an8}Let me say to you all,

282
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,118
I'm pretty sure
this is not a dream.

283
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,740
(crashing, gasps)

284
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,037
Oh, my God, I killed her.

285
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,750
(sobbing)

286
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,420
(gasps)
I've got to apologize.

287
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,879
Once again, sleeping at work
has saved my marriage.

288
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,301
Compromise has no
place in a marriage.

289
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,970
Stick to your guns.

290
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:41,178
And if he leaves, you'll be free
and happy, like us.

291
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,470
Yes. Happy.

292
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,144
So happy.

293
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,602
Hmm.

294
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,567
I'm going to find my husband.

295
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,728
Don't depress the kids.

296
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:02,362
That pacifier's the last
true friend you'll have.

297
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,078
Must apologize.
Must apologize.

298
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,344
(both moan)

299
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,921
I'm sorry we
ever fought.

300
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,297
We can't let Bart
drive us apart.

301
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,804
He's the reason
we had to get married.

302
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,927
Till the two of us
are back on track,

303
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,644
Bart can fend
for himself.

304
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,854
Bart? Bart who?

305
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,685
I'm being cute.

306
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,690
It's working.

307
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,572
(both moaning)

308
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,189
(siren wails, tires screech)

309
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,355
Put down some flares, boys.

310
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,494
We're gonna be here a while.

311
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,492
(indistinct radio transmission)

312
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,251
Awesome breakfast,
Marge.

313
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,502
Breakfast in bed
is so much better

314
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,254
than breakfast
in a chair.

315
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,457
Mmm. I'm gonna go
paste your heads

316
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,468
back into the
family photos.

317
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,720
I've got them
right here.

318
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,640
Dad, I know you're gonna say no,
but Mom would say...

319
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,972
Whatever.
Knock yourself out.

320
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,227
What do you mean?

321
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,978
You may not realize this, Bart,

322
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,440
but your mother and I have been
fighting about you a lot lately.

323
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,771
And I've realized our marriage
is more important

324
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,147
than your future.

325
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,613
From now on, you're on your own.

326
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,113
Really? Okay.

327
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,907
(humming)

328
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,581
Uh, Marge?

329
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,079
I don't want
to ruin the moment,

330
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,750
but you got something stuck
between your...

331
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,039
Oh.

332
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,462
(lusty moaning)

333
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,381
Ah, a peaceful
Saturday afternoon,

334
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,460
with no Bart Simpson, and
no Milhouse, for that matter.

335
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,967
Nothing on my agenda but to sit
here and watch hummingbirds.

336
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,845
(laughing)

337
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,100
Sugar water?

338
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,102
Now, why would someone...
(screams)

339
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,104
Their tiny tongues
are like knives.

340
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,646
(both laughing)

341
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,150
Big mistake.

342
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,401
Attacking me outside
school hours and property.

343
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,903
Legally, I can spank
your bare bottoms.

344
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,196
Follow me.

345
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:15,035
You can't hide forever,
and I'm a very patient man.

346
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:18,462
I once waited an hour
and a half for a haircut.

347
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:21,422
Whoa, what is
this place?

348
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,723
Remember that time I was
carried off by groundhogs?

349
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,838
This is where I wound up.

350
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,466
(electrical crackling)

351
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:32,682
Behold,
an ancient subway station.

352
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,901
I never knew Springfield
had a subway.

353
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,360
It's like a Thomas the Tank
Engine we can go inside.

354
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,111
With no
Sir Topham Hatt

355
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,653
to tell us what we can
and can't do.

356
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,197
(both laugh)

357
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,531
-(mechanical whirring)
-Whoa.

358
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,445
(wheels rattling)

359
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,957
(rumbling)

360
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,080
(gasping)

361
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,036
(glass clattering, breaking)

362
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,547
(low rumbling)

363
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,049
Whoa, whoa.

364
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,590
Which flavor do I save--

365
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,054
the Radical Red
or the Blueberry Blast?

366
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,724
Oh, curse this
Squishee's choice.

367
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,974
(rumbling)

368
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,136
(rumbling stops)

369
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,812
(rumbling)

370
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,274
(rumbling stops)

371
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,475
I love watching you knit.

372
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,775
It reminds me
of watching pictures download

373
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,779
on our old dial-up modem.

374
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,701
Remember that day
we brought it home,

375
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,990
and it was all...

376
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:34,083
eeee... ooo... eee... ooo.

377
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,499
(guttural whirring)

378
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,998
(both laughing)

379
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,921
Oh, my God, Homie, we're
having a real conversation.

380
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,712
Yeah.

381
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,165
Eeee.... ooo.

382
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,295
(guttural whirring)

383
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,762
Oh, you won't believe
how I got home.

384
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,513
Don't know,
don't care.

385
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,474
You don't even want to know
if I have anything to do

386
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,345
with this mysterious
seismic activity of late?

387
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,062
Nope.

388
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,732
I'm saving my yelling
for where it does some good.

389
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,731
(shouting):
Lisa! You're a wonderful child!

390
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,404
Keep up
the good work!

391
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,823
Thanks, Dad.

392
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,281
But you're so loud,
it's hurting my ears.

393
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,952
(shouting):
Sorry!

394
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,531
It's weird.

395
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,195
I just made an entire town
lose its lunch.

396
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,445
And?

397
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,747
And I'm not feeling the rush.

398
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,831
Tell me more.

399
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,206
Something's missing.
Am I broken?

400
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,424
Jump with me.

401
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,554
(both grunt)

402
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,841
Bart, at the end of the day,

403
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,006
if your parents aren't p.o.'d,
you haven't really pranked.

404
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,755
You got to take it up a notch.

405
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,427
Really?

406
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,595
If no one's getting mad,
are you really being bad?

407
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:42,845
Think about it.

408
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,726
Wow.

409
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,153
I know.

410
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,990
The tremors are
tearing her apart.

411
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,321
One more shake, and the whole
school could come down.

412
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,407
Seymour, do something.

413
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,293
Destroy the school, eh?

414
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,214
That's what I'm
talkin' about.

415
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,255
Man, those textbooks
really burn.

416
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,296
"Mom and Dad,

417
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,965
Bart is going
to use the old subway

418
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:21,015
to destroy
Springfield Elementary."

419
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,390
And there's a map of the
subway system attached.

420
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,227
Homer, we've got
to stop him.

421
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,112
But, Marge, I thought
we were chilling out

422
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,769
for the sake
of our marriage.

423
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,737
We're going to have
to be good parents to our son

424
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,819
and work twice as hard
on our marriage.

425
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,615
Fine. I'll do both at once.

426
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,909
We should both take a role
in vacation planning.

427
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,211
(deep rumbling)

428
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,791
Oh, she's coming down.

429
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,126
Oh, Lord,
let me finish this hallway,

430
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,342
then you can send me to hell
a happy man.

431
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,136
(tires screech)

432
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,219
(grunting)
Bart!

433
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,928
(grunting)

434
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,016
Oh, there's a nickel.

435
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,562
(grunting)

436
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,818
Destroy. Destroy.

437
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,453
Boy, look at that ironwork.

438
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,157
Well, I'll be.
There's a sofa in here.

439
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,035
(grunting)

440
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,125
It's stuck.

441
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,174
Must... squeeze... harder.

442
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,717
BART:
Nah...

443
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,590
Why you little....

444
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,346
(grunting)

445
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:44,637
Whoo-hoo!

446
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,265
(screeching, Bart cries out)

447
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,651
The school is saved.

448
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,521
Unfurl the flag.

449
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,874
(birds chirping)

450
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,790
Mister, you
are grounded.

451
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,659
And no TV.

452
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,166
And I'm taking all the exciting
colors out of your crayons.

453
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,878
And when you're out of my sight,
you must constantly Twitter me

454
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,339
exactly what you are up to,

455
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,879
even though I don't
know what Twitter is

456
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,014
and have no desire
to find out.

457
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:21,511
Ah, you guys
are the meanest parents ever.

458
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,305
Thank you.

459
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,848
Life stinks, huh?

460
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,354
Totally.

461
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,395
Mom said she was tipped off
by a note from me.

462
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,399
But you know something?

463
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,731
I didn't write this note.

464
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,904
(nervous chuckle)
That's ridiculous.

465
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,235
If you didn't write it,
who in the world could have?

466
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,031
You wanted to get caught.

467
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,784
Really?

468
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,236
How can you be so sure?

469
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,616
Elementary, my dear Simpson.

470
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,623
Leave it to you
to misspell a word

471
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,995
you see first thing
every morning.

472
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,793
But don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

473
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,207
As far as Mom and Dad know,

474
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,335
you're just a soulless
little psycho.

475
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,012
Thanks, Lis.

476
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,092
Anytime.

477
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,428
