00:15:51,068 --> 00:15:54,138
I am great.
I am awesomeness itself.

353
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:56,651
(chuckles) Oh, attitude reset.

354
00:15:58,015 --> 00:16:00,045
- (crackling)
- (grunting, belches)

355
00:16:00,052 --> 00:16:01,862
Take me back. Please.

356
00:16:01,856 --> 00:16:03,186
See, I say please now.

357
00:16:03,192 --> 00:16:04,662
You want me to beg?

358
00:16:04,662 --> 00:16:05,832
This guy begs.

359
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,231
(crackling)

360
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:08,903
I don't know. Why should I?

361
00:16:08,904 --> 00:16:10,674
Why don't you look outside?

362
00:16:10,674 --> 00:16:12,484
(whirring)

363
00:16:18,122 --> 00:16:20,192
You can run
my charitable foundation.

364
00:16:20,193 --> 00:16:21,733
You can save the planet.

365
00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:24,939
All the dreams you laid out
in this second-grade paper.

366
00:16:24,936 --> 00:16:28,076
You kept that this whole time?

367
00:16:28,075 --> 00:16:30,545
Oh, no, what do I do now?

368
00:16:30,547 --> 00:16:33,347
Um... um...

369
00:16:33,352 --> 00:16:36,932
They say if you love something,
let it go.

370
00:16:36,926 --> 00:16:39,226
And if it loves you,
it'll come back.

371
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:43,611
Ex-Except for your turtle which
got smushed by that mail truck.

372
00:16:43,607 --> 00:16:45,307
Follow your dreams, Lisa.

373
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:48,249
Like you said
in your graduation speech.

374
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:50,789
You remember my speech!

375
00:16:50,787 --> 00:16:52,017
Aw!

376
00:16:52,023 --> 00:16:53,993
(scoffs) He remembered one line.

377
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:56,034
I have it all.

378
00:16:57,133 --> 00:17:00,643
Hubert, this is a side of you
I've never seen.

379
00:17:00,641 --> 00:17:02,551
Goodbye, Nelson.

380
00:17:04,447 --> 00:17:07,047
You idiot.

381
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:10,028
Woah, those really hurt.

382
00:17:10,026 --> 00:17:11,896
<i>HOMER:
Four months later.</i>

383
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:13,326
<i>Wait, that wasn't the end?</i>

384
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,872
<i>She doesn't end up with Hubert?</i>

385
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,909
<i>Oh, wait, oh, I see.</i>

386
00:17:16,906 --> 00:17:18,576
<i>There's still another page here.</i>

387
00:17:18,577 --> 00:17:21,247
<i>Okay. Lisa and Nelson get
a phone call.</i>

388
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,588
<i>Their best friends
are getting married.</i>

389
00:17:23,587 --> 00:17:25,017
<i>The bully with the hat</i>

390
00:17:25,022 --> 00:17:26,992
<i>and Krusty's daughter.</i>

391
00:17:26,993 --> 00:17:29,033
And why am I doing this?
Am I dead?

392
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,470
I hope not.

393
00:17:32,237 --> 00:17:34,437
- (phone rings)
- (groans)

394
00:17:34,441 --> 00:17:35,741
BOTH:
Hello?

395
00:17:35,744 --> 00:17:37,384
- Will you be my maid of honor?
- Will you be my best man?

396
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,650
- I can't believe
- I can't believe

397
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,920
- how much I love him.
- how much I love her.

398
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:40,919
BOTH:
Oh, how are you?

399
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:42,561
- Meh.
- Same old, same old.

400
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:43,828
Blah, blah, blah.

401
00:17:43,827 --> 00:17:46,327
BOTH:
I just hope you find
the happiness I have.

402
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:49,471
It's so great
when severely damaged people,

403
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:52,041
like all of us,
find each other.

404
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:54,113
So, can I count on you?

405
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,054
BOTH:
Sure.

406
00:17:56,051 --> 00:17:58,321
- She's so lucky.
- He's so lucky.

407
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:01,259
I don't have a dog.

408
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:03,271
I got to fix that screen door.

409
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:08,139
("Wedding March" playing)

410
00:18:09,344 --> 00:18:11,484
So, Sophie and Jimbo.

411
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:13,921
I guess
some people have happy endings.

412
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,760
Come on, Lisa. Use the crook
of your arm, not the forearm.

413
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:20,071
No one ever taught you
how to interlock arms?

414
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,236
I know you're not really angry.

415
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:24,406
I know what this is
really about.

416
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:27,007
Just because you know everything
and I know nothing

417
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:29,183
doesn't make you
smarter than me.

418
00:18:29,184 --> 00:18:30,854
Well, maybe it does a little.

419
00:18:30,854 --> 00:18:36,034
(scoffs) You told me to go,
and now you're mad I did.

420
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,541
You haven't changed
since elementary school.

421
00:18:38,536 --> 00:18:41,336
Nobody changes
after elementary school.

422
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:43,911
The church is eating me.

423
00:18:43,913 --> 00:18:46,353
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for coming.

424
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:48,391
And thanks to
this hologram of my father

425
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:51,599
who's about to perform this
beautiful interfaith ceremony.

426
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:54,496
My son, you are
a big needy nothing.

427
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:57,712
Aw, his speech
from my bar mitzvah.

428
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,308
That always gets me.

429
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:01,751
People ask me, "Why Jimbo?"

430
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:05,189
And I say, "Screw you,
mind your own business, Mom."

431
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:06,529
But there's more.

432
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:07,626
He's honest.

433
00:19:07,628 --> 00:19:09,358
He doesn't hide
who he really is,

434
00:19:09,364 --> 00:19:11,774
and there's no one
I could be more in love with.

435
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:14,269
<i>LISA: Have I been missing it
the whole time?</i>

436
00:19:14,274 --> 00:19:16,014
<i>Is Nelson the one?</i>

437
00:19:16,011 --> 00:19:18,851
<i>No. You love Hubert.</i>

438
00:19:23,325 --> 00:19:27,795
You are the smartest, sweetest,
funniest person I've ever met.

439
00:19:28,903 --> 00:19:31,213
Eh, I'll never have a life.

440
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,580
Nelson.

441
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,120
They're bailing!

442
00:19:35,116 --> 00:19:36,816
Thank God I had understudies.

443
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:39,689
("Wedding March" plays)

444
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:43,797
What are you doing out here?

445
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,710
You'll catch cold.
Come on, take my jacket.

446
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:50,182
Why did you follow me?

447
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:53,249
I followed you
because I adore you.

448
00:19:53,252 --> 00:19:55,122
Lisa, I used to know
what it was like

449
00:19:55,122 --> 00:19:57,262
to hurt a person
for no reason.

450
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,030
Don't do it to me.

451
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,800
I couldn't be more serious.

452
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:03,411
<i>I love you

453
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:04,535
<i>I want to talk to at night.</i>

454
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:07,822
<i>When you say "Smell you later,"</i>

455
00:20:07,815 --> 00:20:09,375
<i>I do want to smell you later.</i>

456
00:20:09,384 --> 00:20:11,394
<i>Wherever I've gone
in my life,</i>

457
00:20:11,388 --> 00:20:14,458
<i>I'm drawn back to you
like a dork's face to a swirly.</i>

458
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:16,901
<i>And when I get all wrapped up
in my feelings,</i>

459
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:20,409
<i>you're the one who tells me
feelings are dumb.</i>

460
00:20:20,406 --> 00:20:22,406
But they are dumb,
if you throw away everything

461
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,980
for a loser in a clip-on tie.

462
00:20:24,982 --> 00:20:26,992
I'll tell you what I want, mister.

463
00:20:26,986 --> 00:20:28,886
Haw... Huh?

464
00:20:30,226 --> 00:20:32,056
(bell tolling)

465
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:35,443
I lost the girl,
but I got the bell.

470
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,096
So, I was doing a panel at CPAC,

471
00:20:52,103 --> 00:20:53,973
the Clone Political
Action Committee.

472
00:20:53,973 --> 00:20:55,243
Not the other one, they suck.

473
00:20:55,242 --> 00:20:57,512
And I saw
the tallest drink of water

474
00:20:57,514 --> 00:20:59,154
I'd ever seen in my life.

475
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,420
(chuckles)

476
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:02,089
I looked at him and said,
"There's a man

477
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:03,489
I'd like to share a bed with."

478
00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:06,432
That was a thing
in my day. It was!

479
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,541
Then I found out
he was an actor

480
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:10,466
and, uh, boy,
that was a red flag.

481
00:21:10,473 --> 00:21:13,213
Well, yes, but now
we've been running mates

482
00:21:13,212 --> 00:21:15,052
for four straight terms.

483
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:16,319
Didn't hurt that
we were running

484
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,858
against Jimmy Carter
and Grover Cleveland.

485
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:20,687

486
00:21:20,694 --> 00:21:21,934
Oh, we'll be back.

487
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:24,999
Between my malaise
and his mugwumps, we can't lose.
