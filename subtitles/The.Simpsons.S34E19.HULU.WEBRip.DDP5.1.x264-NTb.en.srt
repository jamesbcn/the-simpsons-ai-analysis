00:00:06,312 --> 00:00:09,992
Hey, bettors, gambling's
now legal in every state,

2
00:00:09,987 --> 00:00:11,257
except the lame ones.

3
00:00:11,256 --> 00:00:13,156
But in the sport
of sports-betting,

4
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:15,229
you got to sport-bet
responsibly.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,900
So, remember to follow
these three rules.

6
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:19,111
Stick with the game plan,

7
00:00:19,105 --> 00:00:21,275
unless you're down a lot
at halftime.

Thank you, football.

11
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:35,611
I almost forgot
to bet on the game.

we'll be eating

19
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:56,379
Let's go, either team!
Any points! Any points!

00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:09,174

(grunting)

31
00:01:22,164 --> 00:01:25,814
Okay, my ring's got to be
down here somewhere.

32
00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:30,306
Man, I got to get a handyman.

33
00:01:30,314 --> 00:01:32,624

guy, what was his name?

34
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:34,419
Dave? Darryl?

(ghostly cackling)

36
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,203
(gasps) Is that a ghost?

37
00:01:42,204 --> 00:01:45,244
If so, that means
the afterlife is real,

38
00:01:45,243 --> 00:01:47,553
which would free me
from my fear of death.

39
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,589
(gasps) Please be a ghost.
(gasps)

40
00:01:49,586 --> 00:01:51,816
The ring.

41
00:01:51,824 --> 00:01:53,134
Huh? Another the ring?

00:01:53,126 --> 00:01:54,296

00:01:54,295 --> 00:01:55,455
(screams) Polecat!

44
00:01:55,464 --> 00:01:58,644
Okay, little skunk,
everything's cool.

45
00:01:58,638 --> 00:02:02,278
I'll just back away calmly,
leave you alone,

46
00:02:02,277 --> 00:02:04,817
and hire someone to kill you.

47
00:02:04,816 --> 00:02:06,216
(soft footsteps)

48
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:07,989

- (gasps) More.

49
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:11,729
- (hissing)
- It's a stink of skunks.

50
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,140
(whimpering)

51
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:16,565
Marge, kids, remember me
how I used to smell,

52
00:02:16,573 --> 00:02:19,153
not as the horrible stench
I'm about to become.

53
00:02:19,145 --> 00:02:22,415
I love you all,
to varying degrees.

54
00:02:22,418 --> 00:02:24,258
(screams)

55
00:02:24,255 --> 00:02:26,885
Ooh, my ring. (screams)

56
00:02:26,894 --> 00:02:29,374
(both laugh)

57
00:02:29,365 --> 00:02:32,435
This is my new
desert island show.

58
00:02:32,438 --> 00:02:35,648
All right, turn around
and spread 'em.

59
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:41,016
Ow! Oh. (laughs)

60
00:02:41,022 --> 00:02:42,862
Ooh. Ow!

61
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:44,159
More, please.

62
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,295
Ew, <i>caramba!</i>

63
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:50,071
Shouldn't you throw
those clothes out?

64
00:02:50,073 --> 00:02:51,483
Rather than clean them?

65
00:02:51,476 --> 00:02:53,246
Don't rob me of the one part

66
00:02:53,246 --> 00:02:55,786
of your dad getting
skunk-sprayed I enjoy.

67
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:58,915
All I need is this pillowcase
and my secret ingredients.

68
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,939
Wow, that took care
of the skunk smell

69
00:03:08,944 --> 00:03:10,314
and the Homer smell.

70
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:12,183
That's amazing, Mom.

71
00:03:12,184 --> 00:03:14,194
How did you learn to do that?

72
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:15,758
Years of practice.

73
00:03:15,758 --> 00:03:19,698
Your father has brought home
so many different smells.

74
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,219
This bag cleans them all.

75
00:03:29,218 --> 00:03:31,418
Wow, an innovation like this

76
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:33,562
could really better
the lives of people

77
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:36,371
who don't have access
to washing machines.

78
00:03:36,365 --> 00:03:38,135
Ooh, like the homeless?

79
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:39,636
You mean unhoused.

80
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,779
I do?

81
00:03:44,248 --> 00:03:46,888
How come all of these
pillowcases are blue?

82
00:03:46,887 --> 00:03:50,427
I think it's from my hair.
Not that I dye my hair.

83
00:03:50,427 --> 00:03:53,797
It's natural. It's just such
a vibrant natural blue that...

84
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:56,971
It's okay, Mom.
The blue's a nice touch.

85
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:00,581
It's a cleaning bag.

86
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:03,391
You shake your dirty clothes
in it, and they come out fresh.

87
00:04:03,386 --> 00:04:05,756
Oh. Oh, you're already doing it.

88
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:09,295
Ah, hot diggity.

89
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:11,238
I can finally get
my old job back

90
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:14,735
as a stock image model
for "man in suit."

91
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,420
Wow, them-there blue bags
are impressive.

92
00:04:21,422 --> 00:04:23,262
Can I give it a try?

93
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:30,144
That bag of yours finally
cleaned my black hat.

94
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,380
Yee-haw!

95
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,315
Let me contribute $100
to your cause,

96
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,115
a Texas penny.

97
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:38,019
So, what's the name
of your charity?

98
00:04:38,022 --> 00:04:39,732
Oh, we don't have a charity.

99
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:42,296
I guess you can
make it out to me.

100
00:04:42,297 --> 00:04:45,637
Uh, you see, this is money
I want to deduct

101
00:04:45,638 --> 00:04:47,708
while avoiding capital gains.

102
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:51,849
So, I can only contribute
to a charitable foundation.

103
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,320
A 501-C-HAW.

104
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:56,661
(gasps) We should become
an actual charity.

105
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,830
Think of how many
more people we would help.

106
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,241
Doesn't that involve
a lot of paperwork?

107
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:02,735
You're in luck, little lady.

108
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:06,579
I got me my accountant
right here.

109
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:11,319
Golly. Here's your articles
of incorporation, ma'am.

110
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:13,562
What do you want to call
that-there charity?

111
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:16,331
Hmm... Why not call it...

112
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:19,312
the Lisa M. Simpson Foundation.

113
00:05:19,305 --> 00:05:20,735
Really?

114
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:23,611
It was your passion for change
that got us here.

115
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,724
I just threw some powder
in a bag.

116
00:05:25,718 --> 00:05:28,188
Here's my charitable deduction.

117
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:30,629
I mean donation. I mean both.

118
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:33,198
I love anything
that gets me out of taxes.

119
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,369
Texas?

120
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:36,908
No, taxes. I hate taxes,

121
00:05:36,907 --> 00:05:38,707
but I love Texas

122
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:42,451
'cause folks in Texas
love Texas and hates taxes.

123
00:05:42,451 --> 00:05:45,691
No taxing's what Texans
stand for.

124
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:51,335
We're a charity!

125
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:53,105
BOTH:
Yee-haw!

126
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:55,976
- Yee-haw.
- Yee-haw, indeed.

127
00:06:00,555 --> 00:06:03,325
I used to ride the rails,
but 'cause of you,

128
00:06:03,326 --> 00:06:06,966
I traded in my bindle
for a briefcase.

129
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:10,342
We're really making a difference
in people's lives.

130
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,640
Even Crazy Cat Lady.

131
00:06:11,643 --> 00:06:14,983
She's giving walking tours
of Springfield now.

132
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:17,893
(mumbling)

133
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:20,529
(cats yowling)

134
00:06:20,528 --> 00:06:22,828
- (cameras clicking)
- (group aahing)

135
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,374
Lisa, can you run over
to the market

136
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,580
and get some more baking soda?

137
00:06:27,575 --> 00:06:30,675
Wait, we're using
Hand & Armor Baking Soda?

138
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:34,521
That company is the worst.
They support child labor.

139
00:06:34,522 --> 00:06:37,962
Even some of their
top executives are children.

140
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:41,142
MARGE: But the smiley hand
on the box is so cute.

141
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:43,905
Our foundation only succeeds
if we're doing good

142
00:06:43,908 --> 00:06:44,878
every step of the way.

143
00:06:44,976 --> 00:06:47,646
We have to make sure that
every ingredient we use

144
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:51,119
is ethically sourced,
even if it costs a little more.

145
00:06:51,122 --> 00:06:52,632
Well, I can help with that.

146
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,655
I put the "fun mom"

147
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:58,173
in the
"fundraising thermometer."

148
00:06:58,169 --> 00:06:59,909
(groans) Mom puns?

149
00:06:59,906 --> 00:07:02,376
I got to wash that
out of my ears.

150
00:07:02,377 --> 00:07:05,347
(grunting)

151
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,990
Okay, while you're
raising money,

152
00:07:06,987 --> 00:07:10,387
I'll scour the world
for fair-trade, carbon-negative,

153
00:07:10,393 --> 00:07:12,633
conflict-free ingredients.
Dad can take me.

154
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:16,312
Oh, that sounds terrible.

155
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:18,075
Oh, it's even worse.

156
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:20,716
I've got a good feeling about
the baking soda manufacturer

157
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:22,985
at the top of this mountain.

158
00:07:22,986 --> 00:07:26,856
Oh, why can't anything good ever
be at the bottom of a mountain?

159
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,600
Our baking soda is actually
generated through meditation.

160
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:32,611
Every ten boxes we make,

161
00:07:32,605 --> 00:07:34,975
a new monk
reaches enlightenment.

162
00:07:38,884 --> 00:07:42,394
Oh, my God, I finally understand
the plot of <i>Inception.</i>

163
00:07:42,391 --> 00:07:44,931
Now to ponder <i>Tenet.</i>

164
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,396
LISA:
Oh...

165
00:07:48,403 --> 00:07:51,243
(sniffs) This is
the first empty fridge

166
00:07:51,242 --> 00:07:52,342
I've ever liked.

167
00:07:52,344 --> 00:07:53,854
(sniffs)

168
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:57,017
Oh, I'll take it.
How much is it?

169
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,460
We don't believe
in worldly possessions,

170
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,498
so you won't have any
after you buy it.

171
00:08:02,497 --> 00:08:04,967
(whistles)

172
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:07,168
(phone whooshes)

173
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:10,378
(phone whooshes)

174
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,550
Show your support

175
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,420
for the Lisa M. Simpson Foundation.

176
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:15,831
Hey, this corner belongs
to the Salvation Army.

177
00:08:15,825 --> 00:08:18,495
Give me that tin
and get out of here.

178
00:08:18,496 --> 00:08:20,366
Unless you'd like
to donate blood.

179
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,867
(bell rings)

180
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,177
Oh, Marge, that was terrible.

181
00:08:26,178 --> 00:08:28,548
Who knew a religious nonprofit

182
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,590
could be so "holier than thou"?

183
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:34,428
As a pillar of the community,
a doctor's wife,

184
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:36,298
I know the secret

185
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:38,438
to running a successful charity.

186
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:40,806
Ooh, can you tell it to me?

187
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:43,648
Even better,
I can sing it to you.

188
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:45,787

210
00:09:40,594 --> 00:09:43,004
I love our new offices.

211
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,669
Well, it used to be
a WeWork space,

212
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:47,679
then a Theranos lab,
then production offices

213
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:50,005
for the WeWork
and Theranos TV shows.

214
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:52,753
Those businesses must have been
such successes

215
00:09:52,752 --> 00:09:55,462
to have TV shows
made about them.

216
00:09:55,457 --> 00:09:56,957
Mm.

217
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:00,941
Is it a little strange that

218
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:03,865
everyone has to walk through my
office to get to the bathroom?

219
00:10:03,874 --> 00:10:06,354
That's your private bathroom.

220
00:10:06,345 --> 00:10:08,775
(gasps) A husbandless bathroom?

221
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:10,924
I won't need a candle.

222
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:12,891
Our "Feeling Blue"
awareness campaign

223
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:15,002
is really hitting its stride.

224
00:10:14,996 --> 00:10:17,636
Look at all these products
supporting our cause

225
00:10:17,635 --> 00:10:19,665
with our copyrighted
shade of blue:

226
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:21,742
blue shampoo, blue conditioner,

227
00:10:21,743 --> 00:10:24,013
blue shampoo plus conditioner,

228
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:27,354
and Boo Berry cereal will be
called Blueberry cereal.

229
00:10:27,354 --> 00:10:28,664
LISA:
Mom.

230
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:30,057
Look at all these people.

231
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:33,429
Our little charity
has become big.

232
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:34,902
Check out our official symbol.

233
00:10:34,903 --> 00:10:37,813
It's the same ribbon we use
to tie the blue bags.

234
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:38,909
They've become so popular

235
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:42,451
we've completely
run out of ribbons.

236
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,760
So what do you tie
the bags with?

237
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:48,128
Well, we're a little behind
in our bag making,

238
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:49,929
but we've been doing something
even more important:

239
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:53,243
raising awareness
about our bag making.

240
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:56,909
This is all very impressive,
but do we really need

241
00:10:56,913 --> 00:10:57,823
a headquarters this big?

242
00:10:57,815 --> 00:11:01,455
Oh, this isn't gonna be
our headquarters.

243
00:11:01,455 --> 00:11:02,825
This is.

244
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:05,495
How on earth are we
paying for that?

245
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:09,536
With a generous deduction...
I mean, I mean, donation...

246
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:13,209
from our Royal Blue level donor:
Mr. Burns.

247
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:16,992
What? He is the biggest
polluter in town.

248
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,569
Excellent.

249
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:27,139
Honey, if we don't accept
the money,

250
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,740
he'll just give it
to someone else,

251
00:11:28,744 --> 00:11:32,754
like the Salvation Army.
(groans)

252
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:35,856
We have to return Burns's money.

253
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:37,858
Return the money?

254
00:11:37,862 --> 00:11:40,502
While you and Dad were tromping
around in the mountains,

255
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,100
I was building an organization

256
00:11:42,103 --> 00:11:44,583
that can make
real change happen.

257
00:11:44,576 --> 00:11:46,106
With what? This?

258
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:50,121
Mom, you're just allowing
evil companies to appear ethical

259
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:52,959
by slapping our color
on their product.

260
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,469
It's bluewashing.
That doesn't help the homeless.

261
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,695
We call them the unhoused.

262
00:11:58,704 --> 00:12:00,914
I call them the unhoused!

263
00:12:00,908 --> 00:12:02,948
Ugh! You've lost sight

264
00:12:02,945 --> 00:12:05,575
of my vision for this charity.

265
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:07,864
I thought it was our charity.

266
00:12:07,855 --> 00:12:10,425
Well, it's my name on the wall.

267
00:12:10,426 --> 00:12:12,026
Well, it's my hair color.

268
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,040
- It's Clairol's color!
- (gasps)

269
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:18,236
Okay, this clearly
got out of hand.

270
00:12:18,242 --> 00:12:21,082
Why don't we take
a little breather.

271
00:12:22,518 --> 00:12:24,758
Okay, have we both calmed down?

272
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:26,456
I don't need to calm down.

273
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,288
I'm your mother.

274
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:29,928
I think I know you better
than you know yourself.

275
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:31,643
Oh, you're making
my future therapist

276
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:35,276
so rich right now.

277
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,546
Maybe we should take

278
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:38,676
a little bit longer of a break.

279
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:40,794
Same time tomorrow.

280
00:12:42,424 --> 00:12:43,764
Okay, are you better?

281
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,800
(groaning)

282
00:12:49,606 --> 00:12:51,036
Okay, this feels good.

283
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,811
I think that last break
was the clincher.

284
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,554
One more and we get
a free sundae. (chuckles)

285
00:12:56,553 --> 00:12:57,993
I have some good news.

286
00:12:57,989 --> 00:12:59,989
The board has decided
to promote you

287
00:12:59,993 --> 00:13:02,673
to "The Lisa M. Simpson Foundation

288
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:05,635
Founder Emeritus."

289
00:13:05,638 --> 00:13:08,308
Wait... emeritus?

290
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:09,879
I know what that means.

291
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,849
You're firing me?

292
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,590
No, we're just
de-responsibilitizing you.

293
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:16,759
Congratulations.

294
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,360
Here's your check.

295
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:20,732
Would you like to round up
with a donation

296
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:22,814
to the Lisa M. Simpson
Foundation?

297
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:26,245
No! I never want to hear
that name again.

298
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,690
It's my favorite student,
Lisa M. Simpson.

299
00:13:30,688 --> 00:13:32,828
- (grunts)
- (muffled groan)

300
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:36,295
There, now you got ice cream.
Let's go.

301
00:13:39,338 --> 00:13:42,108
Yeah, I heard about
what happened.

302
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,280
That I was forced out
by my own mother

303
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,021
from the charity
we created together?

304
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,020
I've never been fired before.

305
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:51,164
What am I supposed to do?

306
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:54,803
You don't know how long
I've been waiting for this.

307
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:56,172
Finally,
I can pass down to my kids

308
00:13:56,171 --> 00:14:00,111
my vast knowledge about
what I'm truly amazing at:

309
00:14:00,113 --> 00:14:02,823
- being canned.
- Really?

310
00:14:02,818 --> 00:14:06,128
Oh, being fired is basically
my job these days.

311
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,925
In fact, I was fired yesterday
because of all the time I took

312
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,370
looking for ingredients
with you.

313
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:12,866
(scoffs) At least you don't
have to live in the same house

314
00:14:12,872 --> 00:14:15,212
as the jerk who fired you.

315
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:16,409
Ah, anger.

316
00:14:16,412 --> 00:14:19,592
The first stage in the
five stages of getting fired.

317
00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:21,985
Oh, so there's
a process to this?

318
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,260
What's stage two?

319
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:25,759
Pretending you still have a job.

320
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,274
MARGE:
Homer, can you
take out the garbage?

321
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:31,279
Oh, sorry, honey.
I'm late for work. Let's go.

322
00:14:33,145 --> 00:14:35,945
So, how long do we have to sit
in this coffee shop?

323
00:14:35,951 --> 00:14:38,691
Until my boss realizes
he made a huge mistake firing me

324
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,030
and begs me to come back,

325
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:42,826
but instead
I pour macaroni salad

326
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:44,572
into his sunroof.

327
00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:46,509
Wasn't anger stage one?

328
00:14:46,506 --> 00:14:48,176
That was righteous anger.

329
00:14:48,175 --> 00:14:50,675
This is misdirected anger!
(grunts)

330
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:54,251
Ah, stage three.

331
00:14:56,091 --> 00:15:00,401
Hi, Lisa. I see you're
still on the couch.

332
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,399
How you doing?

333
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:04,442
I'd be doing a lot better
if you moved that body

334
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:06,251
I "ruined in childbirth."

335
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:08,445
- I ruined it first. (slurps)
- (sighs)

336
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:12,859
Lisa and I aren't supposed to
have doomsday fights like this

337
00:15:12,858 --> 00:15:14,428
until she's 14.

338
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:17,398
She always was precocious.
(sighs) Oh...

339
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,210
Now all she does
is lie around watching TV.

340
00:15:20,206 --> 00:15:23,476
That's stage four:
"glowering without showering."

341
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:26,649
But don't worry,
we're almost at stage five:

342
00:15:26,653 --> 00:15:28,323
"reluctant acceptance."

343
00:15:28,322 --> 00:15:29,262
You'll have your daughter back,

344
00:15:29,257 --> 00:15:32,897
and I won't have to
keep making up stages.

345
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:35,238
Hey, Mom, I wanted to say...

346
00:15:35,236 --> 00:15:37,706
you worked so hard
to make our charity

347
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,308
a successful organization.

348
00:15:39,311 --> 00:15:41,321
And then I came in
criticizing it

349
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,445
and making you feel bad.
I'm sorry.

350
00:15:44,454 --> 00:15:46,534
Oh, sweetie.

351
00:15:46,526 --> 00:15:47,956
Mm, mm.

352
00:15:47,962 --> 00:15:49,602
So, I'll see you
at the grand opening

353
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:53,869
of the Lisa M. Simpson
Foundation Headquarters tonight?

354
00:15:53,874 --> 00:15:55,884
Of course.

355
00:15:55,878 --> 00:15:57,778
I'm proud of you, honey.

356
00:15:57,781 --> 00:15:59,791
You're now ready for stage six:

357
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:02,155
buy podcasting equipment

358
00:16:02,157 --> 00:16:04,927
but never unbox it.

359
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:07,969
And we successfully sued
Pabst Blue Ribbon

360
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,608
for using our trademark symbol.

361
00:16:09,605 --> 00:16:13,345
From now on, they'll be known
as Pabst Teal Fabric Bow.

362
00:16:13,345 --> 00:16:16,285
Our awareness is at
an all-time high.

363
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:19,355
That's great. I guess now
we can put our efforts

364
00:16:19,357 --> 00:16:21,697
into helping people
on the streets.

365
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,170
As the wife of a surgeon,
I'm all about helping people,

366
00:16:27,173 --> 00:16:29,983
but we're a mega-successful
nonprofit,

367
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:31,549
not some charity.

368
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:34,189
As the wife of a radiologist,
I agree.

369
00:16:34,187 --> 00:16:36,527
But what about
all the big donations...

370
00:16:36,526 --> 00:16:39,356
I mean deductions
we got from companies

371
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:42,204
for letting them put our logo
on their products?

372
00:16:42,203 --> 00:16:44,883
Marge, we didn't get money
for that.

373
00:16:44,876 --> 00:16:47,246
The companies paid us
in awareness.

374
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:50,347
But when do we start
helping people?

375
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:53,591
My wife's a dermatologist.

376
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,950
Oh, God, Lisa was right.

377
00:17:06,953 --> 00:17:09,423
We have been bluewashing.

378
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:14,595
I don't deserve to walk
on the blue carpet.

379
00:17:14,602 --> 00:17:16,412
Take me around back.

380
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:21,275
Mm, all this opulence
is making me queasy.

381
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:24,221
Oh, Lisa, queasiness
is just hunger in disguise,

382
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:26,461
like how a hangover
means you should drink more.

383
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:29,868
Okay, boy, what's your intel
on the passed app situation?

384
00:17:29,865 --> 00:17:31,395
We got mini quiches on our six

385
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:33,271
and ahi tuna cones
at ten and two.

386
00:17:33,272 --> 00:17:36,312
Fan out, and don't fall
for the bruschetta.

387
00:17:36,311 --> 00:17:38,321
It's a trap to fill you up.

388
00:17:38,315 --> 00:17:41,285
It's an honor to be
your chicken wing man.

389
00:17:41,288 --> 00:17:43,358
♪

390
00:17:50,674 --> 00:17:51,444
(groans softly)

391
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:54,451
Gil? What are you doing here?

392
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:57,087
I thought our blue bag
turned your life around.

393
00:17:57,086 --> 00:17:59,686
Ah, well, it did, for a bit,
but then they demolished

394
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:02,932
the low-income housing
I was living in to build that.

395
00:18:02,932 --> 00:18:05,202
Now ol' Gil is homeless.

396
00:18:05,202 --> 00:18:06,872
You mean unhoused?

397
00:18:06,873 --> 00:18:08,943
I'm living in a tent
on a sidewalk

398
00:18:08,944 --> 00:18:11,014
and people yell at me
for it every day.

399
00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:12,654
I can call it whatever I want.

400
00:18:12,651 --> 00:18:15,591
(grunts)

401
00:18:17,293 --> 00:18:19,303
(orchestra playing
classical music)

402
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:20,827
- (strings scratch)
- (music stops)

403
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:25,714
And here's the CEO of
the Lisa M. Simpson Foundation,

404
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:27,151
Marge Simpson.

405
00:18:27,146 --> 00:18:29,076
(cheering)

406
00:18:29,084 --> 00:18:31,664
I would like to thank
all of you for coming.

407
00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:35,226
Actually, I would like to judge
all of you for coming.

408
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:36,629
- Huh?
- (overlapping chatter)

409
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:40,213
This charity was supposed
to help the homeless.

410
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:41,876
Instead,
we evicted people to build

411
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:43,846
this extravagant headquarters,

412
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:46,717
creating more homelessness.

413
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:47,959
More homeless on the street

414
00:18:47,955 --> 00:18:50,055
will help raise awareness.

415
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:52,229
I'm done with raising awareness

416
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,600
and with raising money

417
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,370
and with razing
low-income housing.

418
00:18:56,371 --> 00:18:59,281
It's time to turn
the Lisa M. Simpson Foundation

419
00:18:59,277 --> 00:19:00,377
over to the one person

420
00:19:00,379 --> 00:19:03,219
who knew how to run it right
all along,

421
00:19:03,218 --> 00:19:05,218
Lisa Simpson.

422
00:19:05,222 --> 00:19:07,192
(overlapping chatter)

423
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:09,503
Lisa Simpson's a real person?

424
00:19:09,497 --> 00:19:13,167
Thanks, Mom.
As co-head of this organization,

425
00:19:13,172 --> 00:19:16,282
I'm turning this building
into a shelter

426
00:19:16,278 --> 00:19:18,318
- for the unhoused.
- (crowd gasping)

427
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:20,145
Marge, you have to
shut this down.

428
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:23,062
No, I have to open this up.

429
00:19:23,058 --> 00:19:25,128
(overlapping chatter)

430
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:27,169
(gasps) They don't know
which fork to use.

431
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,806
She's wearing a dress
I gave away.

432
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:34,275
(blubbers) That's the man I had
in my windshield for a night.

433
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,080
Enough of this do-goodery.

434
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:37,594
Open your eyes, rich people.

435
00:19:37,588 --> 00:19:39,688
We're not here to help
the less fortunate,

436
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:42,432
we're here to bask
in our fortunateness.

437
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,270
If we really wanted
to make a difference,

438
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:47,037
we'd do the one thing
we've spent our lives avoiding,

439
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,910
paying our taxes.

440
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,150
(laughter)

441
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,918
Then one organization,
"the government,"

442
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,860
could tackle all
of society's ills,

443
00:19:55,857 --> 00:19:58,627
instead of leaving it
to 1.5 million separate

444
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,740
ego-driven micro-bureaucracies
called "charities,"

445
00:20:02,738 --> 00:20:06,108
including... get a load
of this scam... religions.

446
00:20:06,111 --> 00:20:08,451
But no one here wants
the rational way.

447
00:20:08,449 --> 00:20:11,289
We all want the United Way

448
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:13,558
because that's the American way.

449
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,470
Now, I paid $10,000
for this table.

450
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,665
I'm taking it with me.

451
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:25,583
Thank you, Mom. You did
something really great tonight.

452
00:20:25,584 --> 00:20:28,494
Now, let's turn this building
over to the homeless.

453
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:31,699
Yes. We just need
to get this notarized.

454
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,970
LISA and MARGE:
Yee-haw!
