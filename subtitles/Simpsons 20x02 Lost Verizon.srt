1
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,566
D'oh!

2
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,638
BART: Ay, caramba!

3
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,190
Out of gas? But how?

4
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,193
I put a dollar in this morning
and we've only driven 90 cents!

5
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:37,397
You had to drive with the windows
down, didn't you, Rockefeller?

6
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:41,067
Now get some gas while I read
my bingo strategy guide!

7
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,167
Let's see... B-12.

8
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,814
I did it!

9
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,183
Bonehead.

10
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,092
Huh?

11
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:12,198
This counts as a
parent/teacher conference!

12
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,232
Am I seeing this right?

13
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,738
I am! Time to spread the word!

14
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,180
Hey, Milhouse.
- Talk to me.

15
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,280
Skinner's doing what?

16
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,901
I'm on my way!
- I'm on my way!

17
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,106
I'll clean you up good, giant beer can!

18
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,982
Where's Simpson?
- I couldn't get a hold of him.

19
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:08,862
No cell phone. But if I know Bart,
he's busy doing something awesome!

20
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,558
I don't know why I agreed to this.

21
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,160
Because you love the taste
of my imaginary tea.

22
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,197
Oh, you're right.

23
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,634
Hey, spaz.
While you were here spazzing yourself,

24
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,002
you totally missed out.

25
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:26,172
Missed out? I didn't miss out.
What did I miss out on?

26
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,514
I wish I had a cell phone.

27
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:39,085
Here's an imaginary cell phone.
- What? Do you think I'm crazy?

28
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,025
Mom, even Milhouse has a cell phone!
Your son is lamer than Milhouse!

29
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,427
What does that say about you?

30
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,697
Sweetie, we can't afford
to get you a cell phone.

31
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:54,877
As it is, I'm buying frozen peas
on installments.

32
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,645
I'm never gonna get a cell phone.

33
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,580
And I'm never gonna go to Machu Picchu.

34
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,675
In this family,
you get used to disappointments.

35
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:16,264
How am I ever gonna get a cell phone?

36
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,204
Is this your ball?
- Why, yes, it is!

37
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,820
Here you go.
- Don't tell me where I go!

38
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,078
A dollar? What for?
- It's the least I can do.

39
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,881
These balls cost five dollars new.

40
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,317
So I can get a dollar
for every ball I find?

41
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:48,054
Then if a cell phone costs $100,
how many balls do I need?

42
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,223
This is why my kids go to private school.

43
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,593

44
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,262
I keep my nose on the grindstone

45
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,362
I work hard every day

46
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:02,302
I might get a little tired on the weekend,
after I draw my pay

47
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,269
But I'll go back workin'

48
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:09,865
Come Monday morning
I'm right back with the crew

49
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,747
I'll drink a little beer that evening

50
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,847
Huh?

51
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,760
I'll fix you, you varmint!

52
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,423
Wow! I'm just 20 balls away
from a cell phone!

53
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:24,624
WILLIE: So it's you!

54
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,360
You're the one that's been
poaching on my territory!

55
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,528
Groundskeeper Willie?

56
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,664
Weekends and summers,
I'm Greenskeeper Willie.

57
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,234
Your ball-scavenging days are over!

58
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,869
And those orphan golf balls belong to me!

59
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,529
Dimpled gold. I'm rich!

60
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,674
Now I won't have to pleasure a
country club wife to get me steak dinner!

61
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,386
I'm never gonna get a cell phone.

62
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,380
Great.
We gotta wait for Denis Leary.

63
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:01,594
Hey, Leary, if you want to have
a 'tee' party, go back to Boston!

64
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,796
Boston.

65
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,601
Come on, Ice Age, take the shot!

66
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,103
Ice Age was the name of the film.

67
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,406
I played Diego, the vicious saber tooth
tiger who, guess what, has a heart.

68
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,775
Now shut up or I'll have you all
kicked out of show business.

69
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,513
Damn it!

70
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,517
A cell phone!

71
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,653
It's mine!

72
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,060
Cool. You can even
watch commercials on it!

73
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,968
Hey, Milhouse.
Guess where I'm calling from?

74
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,370
Well, I know you don't have a cell phone.

75
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,640
So you must be in your kitchen
or one of your bedrooms.

76
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,176
Unless you have a wall jack
in your basement!

77
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:53,046
That would be huge!
- Look outside your window.

78
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,848
I'm not supposed to look out the window
when I'm alone.

79
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,948
Just do it!

80
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,618
Cell phone!

81
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,195
Let's assign each other ring tones!

82
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,026
That felt good.

83
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,198
Hello? You want Denis Leary?
Wrong number, dumbass.

84
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,867
Come on, Denis.
It's me, producer Brian Grazer.

85
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:18,171
I just paid five million dollars
for the screen rights to the book...

86
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,640
Everybody Poops.
- I'm a big fan.

87
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,777
Only one face came to mind
for the constipated gorilla. Yours.

88
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:28,147
Sure. On one condition.
I want to do my own poops.

89
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,917
I wouldn't have it any other way.

90
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,353
Of course I'll do it for minimum. Great.

91
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,388
I'll see you next Monday in Tunisia.

92
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,523
This phone belongs to Denis Leary!

93
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:43,196
Denis Leary? Boston comedian turned
movie star turned basic cable notable?

94
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,832
That's right! Let's call his business
manager and tell him...

95
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:49,235
...to spend all his money on Yankees hats
and Derek Jeter jerseys.

96
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:52,972
I don't know, Bart.
What if Denis Leary gets mad?

97
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:57,322
Nah. He's cool.
He's gonna think this is hilarious.

98
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,183
No longer must we live in shame.

99
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,946
Let the decree go forth. Everybody poops!

100
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:12,718
And cut! Great. Great, man.
You really nailed it.

101
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,027
I don't even remember
agreeing to be in this movie.

102
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,932
Well, you did. Bring in the poop.

103
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,470
Milhouse, I hold in this hand
Denis Leary's cell phone.

104
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,740
And in this hand, the phone numbers
of bars around the world.

105
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,880
Let's start with Hawaii.

106
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,880
Aloha.
- Aloha to you.

107
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,416
I'm looking for Maya,
last name Normousbutt.

108
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:40,253
Hang on. I'll check, has anyone
here seen Maya Normousbutt?

109
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:53,966
I got a Drew Peewiener here?
Anyone expecting a Drew Peewiener?

110
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,536
I hold in my hand a Drew Peewiener!

111
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,337
Better put it down then, mate!

112
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:13,583
I shall inquire.
Is there a Mr. Myfriendsaregay?

113
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:19,818
First name Olaf. Attention, everyone!
Olaf Myfriendsaregay!

114
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:26,194
Wait a minute. If I
ever get a hold of you,

115
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:31,270
I will thank you for showing me
the futility of human endeavor.

116
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:35,641
The sun never sets
on the Bartish Empire.

117
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,111
Yo. Who's this?
- Denis Leary, you little puke!

118
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,980
I'm gonna rip out your heart
with two fingers!

119
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,615
They taught me how to do it for my show!

120
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:46,085
Which one? The one that got canceled
or the one that's gonna get canceled?

121
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,920
You are so dead!

122
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:52,191
That laughter sounds like
the result of misbehavior.

123
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,460
Bart, how did you get a cell phone?

124
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,663
Same way you got me.
By accident on a golf course.

125
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,965
Whose phone is this?

126
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,667
You'll never get it out of me!
- Okay. Milhouse?

127
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,767
It's Denis Leary's!

128
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,974
I'm sorry, Bart. I'm desperate for
any signs of adult approval.

129
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,114
You did the right thing.

130
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,649
Bart Simpson's stolen cell phone.
Can I help you?

131
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,852
Damn straight, you can. I'm Denis Leary.
And your kid is out of control.

132
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:24,190
I'm sorry, Mr. Leary.
Sometimes it's hard to be a parent.

133
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,158
No it's not. It's easy.
I'll tell you what's hard.

134
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,427
Having to watch my stunt double
run into a burning building,

135
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,530
worrying that people might realize
it's not me, it's him.

136
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,265
Try doing that!

137
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,365
I don't think I could.

138
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,594
Mr. Leary, I'm so sorry.

139
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,704
I'll send you your phone back right away.

140
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,940
Keep the phone.
In fact, can I give you some advice?

141
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,142
Of course. You're Denis Leary.

142
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,531
Give your kid back the phone.

143
00:10:44,631 --> 00:10:46,612
But first, activate its
built-in GPS system.

144
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,815
That way you can log onto your carrier's
website and track your son's movements,

145
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:53,586
the way I track every actor
who gets a movie that I was up for.

146
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:56,088
Shouldn't you just be happy
for their success?

147
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,078
I should be a lot of things, lady.

148
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,625
My tarts!

149
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:16,602
Okay, here goes.
Bart, I have something for you.

150
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,710
Huh?

151
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,382
Wait a minute.
I thought you said I couldn't have this.

152
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:27,019
Well, sweetie, I know I said
you couldn't have a cell phone.

153
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:30,756
But in these days of stranger dangers
and sinister ministers,

154
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,892
I think it's important
that we're in touch.

155
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,780
Lady, you are the best mom ever!

156
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,938
Did he take the bait?
- Like a bigmouth bass.

157
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,010
Okay. Bart went to the comic book store.

158
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,078
Time to head home.

159
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:55,245
Bullies!

160
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,550
Hey! He went into a construction site!

161
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,845
That's a hard-hat zone!

162
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,389
You sure this is safe?

163
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,991
Sure. I got my seatbelt on.

164
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,641
MARGE: Bartholomew J. Simpson!

165
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,961
MILHOUSE: Whoa!

166
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,632
What are you doing at this
construction site?

167
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,166
Trying to do something constructive?

168
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,832
I'll just take Milhouse home.

169
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,869
...

170
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,499
...You better watch your step

171
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,649
Bye

172
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,274
I send you all my regards

173
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,153
You're so tough

174
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,122
You're so hard

175
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:41,091
Listen to the hammers
falling in the breaker's yard

176
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,871
You better watch your step

177
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,009
You better watch your step

178
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,936
Ooh, watch your step

179
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,314
Hey, Bart just keeps spinning around
and around and around.

180
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,414
What's his angle?

181
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,524
What are you two doing
in the laundry room?

182
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,616
We're doing the laundry.

183
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,294
Dad, do laundry.
- No problem.

184
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,446
Tracking software?

185
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,638
You're spying on Bart.

186
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:40,653
Honey, keeping track of someone
because you love them is not wrong.

187
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,753
It shows you care!

188
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,992
That's right, my beautiful,
beautiful Midge.

189
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,396
Soon you'll be mine.

190
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,555
Keep talking, creepo.

191
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:56,660
Every word buys you another year
in the slammer.

192
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:05,277
Bart, there's something
I need to tell you.

193
00:14:05,306 --> 00:14:06,412
Mom and Dad...

194
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,782
...I'm listening to financing
terms for double-glazed windows.

195
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,051
Awesome. Another call. You got Bart.

196
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,920
It's me, you idiot.
Mom and Dad are spying on you.

197
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,523
There's a tracking chip
in your cell phone.

198
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,626
They're spying on me?
That's horrible.

199
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:24,096
I know! It's a complete violation of
your rights! Not to mention...

200
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,931
Hold that thought. I'm getting a text.

201
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,727
Viagra at five dollars a pill?

202
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,438
Whatever it is,
it's going in Skinner's coffee.

203
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,538
What is in this coffee?

204
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,249
Mmm-hmm.

205
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,089
Track this, Mom and Dad.

206
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,261
MARGE: Look at Bart go!

207
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:58,497
He must be running away!
- He won't get far.

208
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,699
Not on that crappy breakfast
I made for him.

209
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,434
MARGE: Oh, my God. He's out of frame!

210
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,559
Zoom out! Zoom out!

211
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,876
He's circling the
Shelbyville Bird Sanctuary.

212
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:16,206
Our little boy has lost his mind.
Let's get him.

213
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,524
Looks like I've got the house
to myself for a while.

214
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,694
I can do anything I want!
First, I'm gonna take a bath.

215
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,763
Then I'm gonna eat some vegetables.

216
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:35,994
And then I'm gonna get to bed
nice and early with no TV!

217
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,811
So your family's been gone for three days?

218
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:48,280
Yeah. And I think they may be gone
a while longer.

219
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,290
It looks like the grilled
Twizzlers are ready.

220
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:55,285
Mmm. Yeah. This baby is done.

221
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,296
Awesome! But I better get going.

222
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,699
It's getting dark.
My mom's gonna wake up soon.

223
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,835
She gets upset if someone's not there
to tell her where she is.

224
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,504
Typical mom.

225
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,207
You sure you don't want to stay
and have a sleepover?

226
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,442
I made sleepover shirts!

227
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:17,543
Huh? Huh?

228
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,612
Listen, Bart. If I don't get home soon,

229
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,881
there won't be time for my mom
to give me a hug,

230
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,684
my dad to read me a story,
and both of them to sing me a song...

231
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:28,249
...till I gently fall asleep.

232
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,056
Anyway, you have fun by yourself.

233
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,925
Hmm. There's no moon tonight.

234
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,084
Real boogeyman weather.

235
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,473
Bart's been moving nonstop all afternoon.

236
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:51,477
Maybe there's too much sugar
in his Sugar Frosted Candy-O's.

237
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,545
Something about this
just doesn't seem right.

238
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,365
Pull over! Bart's in this field!

239
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:01,745
Bart? Where are you, boy?

240
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,914
Don't worry. I won't strangle you.

241
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,700
I think we're following you!
What's your species, little guy?

242
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,374
You're a scarlet tanager.

243
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:25,210
You've been flying south
because you're migrating to...

244
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,310
Machu Picchu, Peru?

245
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,949
Well, I could tell Mom
and Dad the chip is in a bird...

246
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,785
...and hope they take me to
Machu Picchu another time.

247
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,852
Or...

248
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,585
Mom, Dad, Bart's on the move!

249
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,742
Man, when you're alone, night is scary.

250
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,764
Day is awesome!

251
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,802
Night is scary.

252
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,902
Day is awesome!

253
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,239
Night is scary.

254
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:02,261
Are we ever going to find him?

255
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,517
Absolutely. That unpleasantness
in Ecuador is behind us,

256
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:08,520
my coca leaf addiction is under control,

257
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,805
and Bart is finally trapped in that
paradise above the clouds.

258
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,657
Bart! Where are you, Bart?

259
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,766
Is that him?

260
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,461
No. It's just a bush.

261
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:30,285
Clearly the work of Wirakocha,
the trickster god.

262
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,846
You guys look exhausted.
Maybe you ought to rest for a while.

263
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,782
No! All I care about is finding my boy!

264
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:41,302
And then I'm never letting him
out of my sight again!

265
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:52,566
Greetings, sky-haired sun mother.

266
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:56,668
I don't need any new friends.
I'm just looking for my little boy.

267
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,871
I need to protect him from himself.

268
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:04,496
Like the mothers of ancient Machu
Picchu protected their children?

269
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,119
Our mothers were the
most overprotective...

270
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,422
...in the greater Machu Picchu
metropolitan area.

271
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,892
They forced their children to live
in this walled mountain city.

272
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,119
Those walls do look safe.

273
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,330
Walls that keep out danger
keep out knowledge.

274
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,933
Our young people never learned
to survive on their own.

275
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:33,218
So when they grew up they were
no match for the conquistadors.

276
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,282
Oh, my God.
You've taught me a valuable lesson.

277
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,983
I didn't mean to. I'm just chatty.

278
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:50,523
I sold my business a few years ago.
And I miss talking to people.

279
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:56,962
So I can't always be there for Bart.
He's got to learn to take care of himself.

280
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,398
The computer says
Bart's standing on the computer.

281
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,835
All I see is a stupid bird
with a tracking chip on its leg.

282
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,935
It doesn't add up.

283
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,599
I think it's time for us to go home.

284
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,304
Hey.
- Thank God you're okay!

285
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,218
Were you guys gone?

286
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,153
We were gone for two weeks!

287
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,253
I didn't even notice.

288
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,323
Oh.

289
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:29,353
Well, I just made a 3,700-mile car trip.
I need to wash up.

290
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,861
Oh!

291
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,863
Never leave again!

292
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,139
Where's Maggie?

293
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,239
She's...
