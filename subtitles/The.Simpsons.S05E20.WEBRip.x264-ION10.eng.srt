{\an8}Oh! How can they

{\an8}on a beautiful day like this?

{\an8}They're not imprisoning

{\an8}Prison bus, Otto?

13
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,824
{\an8}The regular school bus
broke down.

00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,656
{\an8}So take a seat before
I blow your heads off!

{\an8}Hey, Huck,
what's L-I-N-C-O-N doing here?

00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,700
{\an8}I don't know.
It's your fantasy.

{\an8}-Hi, Abe.
-Hello, Bart.

00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,580
{\an8}(all groaning)
Ow! Ow!

25
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:06,544
Well, children, our new ultra-hard
posturific chairs have arrived.

26
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,166
They've been designed
by eminent posturologists

27
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,424
to eliminate slouching
by the year 3000.

28
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,086
Mrs. Krabappel--
(groans)

29
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,224
I'm having back spasms!

30
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,431
(chuckles) I know they seem a little
uncomfortable right now.

31
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,353
But eventually your bones
will change shape.

32
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:25,732
(slurred) I've lost all feeling
in the left side of my body.

33
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,062
Yeah. Yeah.

34
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,817
Now, unfortunately
our school clocks

35
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,688
have been running fast
all semester,

36
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,685
so today we all have
to stay two extra hours

37
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,277
to make up
for the time we lost.

38
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,872
-Ha!

00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,291

(engine revving)

42
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,921
And to think I got all this after
dropping out of the fourth grade.

00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,388
-(laughs)
-(tires screech)

44
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:00,258
That does it. I'm outta here.

45
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,306
Mrs. Krabappel,
I have to go to the dentist.

46
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,810
I have a caraway seed
caught under my bridgework.

47
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,805
{\an8}My mom's number's there
if you wanna check up on me.

48
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,187
That's okay, Bart.
I trust you.

49
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,107
"Please excuse
my handwriting.

50
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,355
"I busted whichever
hand it is I write with.

51
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,407
Signed, Mrs. Simpson."

52
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,990
You were right
to be suspicious, Edna.

53
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,575
To the crime lab.

54
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,250
Hmm. Inconclusive.
(scoffs)

55
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,173
I wish more students had agreed to
these electronic tracking implants.

56
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,302
We only had one volunteer.

57
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,259
(beeping)

58
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,758
Spill it!
Where's your brother?

59
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,144
You'd better answer him, Lisa.
He's a bad man.

60
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,932
(giggling)

61
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,345
What are you laughing about?

62
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,523
You started off
as the bad cop.

63
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,982
And now you're the good one.

64
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,652
You and Willie got mixed-up
about 10 minutes ago.

65
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,821
We did not!
Now, where's Bart?

66
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,109
You better tell me!

67
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,692
Oh! You better
tell him, Lassie.

68
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,447
I cannot control him
when he gets like this.

69
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,368
(giggles)
Now you're the good cop.

70
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,368
What?

71
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,120
(sighs)

72
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,332
The joys of
mortgaging your future.

73
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,752
(splashing)

74
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,710
Huh?

75
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,745
(gasps)
My fantasy's come true!

76
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,965
Hey, kid.
You wanna see a dead body?

77
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,300
(screams)

78
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,428
If I were a truant boy
out for a good time,

79
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,934
I'd be right here--

80
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,555
The Springfield Natural
History Museum.

81
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:32,063
(chuckling)
You're mine, Simpson.

82
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,782
Look, if I was under 17,
I'd be in school, right?

83
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,319
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Enjoy "Boob-a-rama", sir.

84
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,534
Why, there are no children here
at the 4-H club either.

85
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,247
Am I so
out of touch?

86
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,368
No. It's the children
who are wrong.

87
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,581
-(gavel raps)
-Sold to the small man

88
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,708
with the runny nose
for 2.3 million.

-(snickers)
-(clears throat)

90
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,127
Our next highest bid, uh,

91
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,466
I believe was yours, sir,
for 2.1 million.

92
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,802
(laughs)

93
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,467
-(doors slam)
-Yes.

94
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,766
Were there any serious bids
for this painting?

95
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,730
(all murmuring)

96
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,063
-(gasps)
-(gasps)

97
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,528
Can't let Dad
see me playing hooky!

98
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,278
I can't let the boy
see me skippin' work.

99
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,374
-Good afternoon.
-How do you do, sir?

100
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,829
(both snicker)

101
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,869
BOTH: Sucker!

102
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,288
(gasps)
A spoor! Hmm--

103
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,754
His brand of gum,
Doublemint.

104
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,745
Trying to double
your fun, eh, Bart?

105
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,877
Well, I'll double
your detention.

106
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,134
(chuckles)

107
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,965
I wish someone
was around to hear that.

108
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:47,221
And so we enter endgame.

109
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,018
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

110
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,315
(panting)

111
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,579
(evil laugh)

112
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,539
Let's see him track me now.

113
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:27,264
Oh, my God! He is like
some sort of...

114
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,465
non-giving up...

115
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,425
school guy.

116
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,187

117
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,202

(whimpers)

119
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,593
Oh, he's close.

120
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,507
I can taste his fear.

121
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,888
What the--

122
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,728
(laughs)

123
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:21,612
Freddy, honey. I think something
just dropped into the backseat.

124
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,071
I'm not paying you
to talk.

125
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,495
Gimme the ball!

126
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,588
People, the punch has been spiked.
(laughs)

127
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,510
(laughs)
That's my nephew,

128
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,090
displaying the Quimby wit
that's won the public's heart.

129
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,887
Happy birthday, Freddy.

130
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,680
And may all your disgraces
be, uh, private.

131
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,484
-Yes.
-ALL: Hear! Hear!

132
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,611
(grunts)

133
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,530
And who are you,
little boy?

134
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,649
I'm one of your nephews
you don't see very often,

135
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,946
uh, Bart-Bart.

136
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:14,334
Hey, McBain, I'm a big fan,
but your last movie really sucked.

137
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,920
I know. There were
script problems from day one.

138
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,128
Yeah, I'll say.
Magic ticket my ass, McBain.

139
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,880
Maria, my mighty heart
is breaking.

140
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,013
I'll be in the Humvee.

141
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,470
(chattering)

142
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,640
Hey, what the hell is this?

143
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,599
It is a bowl
of "Shao-dair," Sir.

144
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,599
Wait a minute.
Come here.

145
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,020
What did you call it?

146
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,558
Say it loud enough
so everyone can hear.

147
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,602
Come on. Say it.

148
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,685
(clears throat)
"Show-dair."

149
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,191
(laughing)

150
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,744
"Shao-dair"?
"Shao-dair"?

151
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,568
It's "Chowdah."
Say it right!

152
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,662
-"Shah-der."
-(laughs)

153
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,702
Come back here! I'm not
through demeaning you!

154
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,962
Wow! This is the biggest
Rice Krispie square I've ever seen.

155
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,630
Boy, the rich sure
know how to live.

156
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,797
-Say it, Frenchy. Say "Chowdah!"
-Never!

157
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,847
FREDDY: Okay, you asked for it.
I'm gonna enjoy this.

158
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,403
(pots banging,
glass shattering)

159
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,768
-(snapping)
-WAITER: Ow, ooh. Ow, ooh. Ow, ooh.

160
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,645
Whoa!

161
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:31,653
(gasps)
Oy! That's gotta hurt!

162
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,117
Oh, my God!

163
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,869
Someone's taken a bite
out of the big Rice Krispie square!

164
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,663
Oh, yeah, and the waiter's
been brutally beaten.

165
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,866
(laughs)

166
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,456
(groans)

167
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,883
It says Freddy Quimby beat
a waiter half to death.

168
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:52,553
Hmm. Those Quimby children
are so wild and rich.

169
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,593
I hope he finally gets
what's coming to him.

170
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,297
But Freddy Quimby's innocent!

171
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,597
How do you know?
There weren't any witnesses.

172
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,481
(chuckles)
Oh, yeah. Right.

173
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,059
You'd think someone
would've seen something

174
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,774
at a crowded party
like that.

175
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,734
Well, they didn't, okay?
They didn't!

176
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,234
It says so right here
in black-and-white, "No witnesses."

177
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,397
Case closed.
Now, let's all read the funnies.

178
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,696
Oh, look, Charlie Brown
said, "Good grief."

179
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,660
(chuckles)
I didn't see that comin'.

180
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,252
Lisa, I gotta tell somebody.

181
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,210
I was at the Quimby
compound yesterday

182
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,630
when that frog waiter
got whacked.

183
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,878
I know that Freddy Quimby
is innocent.

184
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,590
You're a witness?

185
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,960
Bart, you have to
tell the police.

186
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,917
-(sighs) I can't.
-Why?

187
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,888
Bart Simpson, I know you
cut school yesterday.

188
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,220
And as soon as I can prove it,
I'm shipping you off

189
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,096
to the Christian
military reform school.

190
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,104
What he said.

191
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,766
Oh, I see.

192
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,694
If you testify, Skinner
will know you skipped school.

193
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,074
Well, if Freddy Quimby
didn't do it,

194
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,861
I'm sure he'll be found innocent
by a fair and impartial jury.

195
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,066
Oh, jury duty!

196
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,907
I'll see that Quimby kid
hang for this!

197
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,582
(groans)

198
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,951
I knew it was a bad idea
to watch him open the mail.

199
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,538
Let's go over to the county
courthouse live to Kent Brockman.

200
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:11,295
--ockman, just outside the county
courtroom where an argument about chowder

201
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,629
has spilled over into the biggest trial
in Springfield history.

202
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,385
Behind these doors,
a federal judge

203
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,638
will ladle out
steaming bowls

204
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,549
of rich, creamy justice

205
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,138
in a case the media
have dubbed

206
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,273
"Beat-up waiter."
(scoffs)

207
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,310
This reporter
suggested "Waitergate,"

208
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,484
but was shouted down
at the press club.

209
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,192
Now, it's illegal to televise
court proceedings in this state,

210
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,613
(whispering)
so we'll have to be quiet.

211
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,652
Oh!

212
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,161
SKINNER: <i>I know you can</i>
<i>read my thoughts, Bart.</i>

213
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:45,002
<i>Just a little reminder--</i>
<i>If I find out you cut class,</i>

214
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,289
<i>your ass is mine.</i>

215
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,253
<i>Yes, you heard me.</i>

216
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,503
<i>I think words</i>
<i>I would never say.</i>

217
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:56,336
HOMER: <i>I know you can</i>
<i>read my thoughts, boy.</i>

218
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,344
<i>♪ Meow meow meow meow</i>
<i>meow meow meow meow ♪</i>

219
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,046
<i>♪ Meow meow meow meow</i>
<i>meow meow meow meow ♪</i>

220
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:07,016
I intend to prove that
Freddy Quimby is totally innocent.

221
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:11,151
First of all, his accuser
is a very shady character.

222
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,980
That waiter, Mr. Lacoste,
not only wasn't born in Springfield,

223
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,857
he wasn't even born
in this country!

224
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,116
(gasping, murmuring)

225
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,489
It's an exclusive!

226
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,576
From now on,
you tell me everything.

227
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:29,961
Uh, Freddy Quimby was with me
the entire night in question.

228
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,460
We were collecting canned goods
for the starving people in,

229
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,844
uh, you know,
one of them loser countries.

230
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,721
-Well, that clears Quimby.
-He's clearly innocent.

231
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,679
Oh, good.
My laundry is done.

232
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,011
You see, Lisa?
They don't need my testimony.

233
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,096
Only because Mayor Quimby
is buying his nephew's freedom.

234
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,523
(sighs)
The system works.

235
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,232
Just ask Claus von Bulow.

236
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,812
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going
to prove to you not only

237
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,728
that Freddy Quimby is guilty,

238
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:59,026
but that he is also innocent
of not being guilty.

239
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,241
I refer you to my
expert witness, Dr. Hibbert.

240
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,623
Well, only one in
two million people has

241
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,240
what we call
the "evil gene."

242
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,288
Hitler had it.
Walt Disney had it.

243
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,502
And Freddy Quimby has it.
(chuckles)

244
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:17,054
Thank you, Dr. Hibbert.
I rest my case.

245
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,049
You rest your case?

246
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,471
What? Oh, no. I thought that
was just a figure of speech.

247
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,840
Case closed.

248
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,008
Excuse me, your honor.

249
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,926
Yes, I'd like to bring something
to the court's attention.

250
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,886
(snoring)

251
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,481
Huh? What?

252
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,274
Give those glasses
to the bailiff.

253
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,898
All right.

254
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,985
-And those.
-Oh!

255
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,122
Your Honor, even though
I've proven my client's innocence,

256
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,290
I'd still like to call
Freddy Quimby to the stand

257
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,870
so that we can all
bask in his gentle decency.

258
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,247
He's wealthy,
therefore, inherently good.

259
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,044
WOMAN: He has
innocent-looking hair.

260
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,587
Mr. Quimby, did you
assault Mr. Lacoste?

261
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:04,763
Of course not. I love each and every
living thing on God's green earth.

262
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,934
Well, therefore, you certainly would
never lose your temper

263
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,393
over something as trivial
as the pronunciation of "chowder."

264
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,975
That's "chowdah!"
"Chowdah!" I'll kill you!

265
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,731
I'll kill all of you!

266
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,443
Especially those of you
in the jury!

267
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,363
-(gasps, murmuring)
-He's clearly guilty.

268
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,281
Wow, that didn't go well.
The defense rests.

269
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,161
Will the jury retire
and come to its decision?

270
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,989
(chuckles)
This won't take long.

271
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,284
He's clearly guilty.

272
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,997
We'll probably be home
by dinnertime.

273
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,668
Good. Tonight, the dog from <i>Frasier</i>
is gonna ride the dolphin on <i>Seaquest.</i>

274
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,503
Well, Bart,
because of you,

275
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,625
a horrible yet innocent
person is going to jail.

276
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,803
Hmm. Maybe I should
come forward.

277
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,303
Oh, I can't wait till the sentencing part.
That's where I really shine.

278
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,730
Bart Simpson,
for the heinous crime of hooky,

279
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:56,848
I sentence you to a lifetime
of hard labor in the cafeteria.

280
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,981
(raspy voice)
More creamed corn, Jimbo Jr.?

281
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,236
This creamed corn tastes
like creamed crap.

282
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,200
Watch the potty mouth, honey.

283
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,951
(sighs)

284
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,245
Your sister says you have
something to tell me.

285
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,159
What? Uh--

286
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,537
Um, yeah. Oh, I just--

287
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,335
I just wanted to say
how great it is

288
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,588
to finally see some
chicks on the bench.

289
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,670
-Mm.
-Keep up the good work, toots.

290
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,876
(laughs)

291
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,086
(door closes)

292
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,676
(groans)

293
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,221
(chuckles)
Chicks on the bench.

294
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,345
(nervous chuckle)

295
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,150
Why bother votin'?
He's guilty.

296
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,902
Well, we might as well
make it official.

297
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,654
What does "sequestered" mean?

298
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,816
If the jury is deadlocked,
they're put up in a hotel together

299
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,775
so they can't communicate
with the outside world.

300
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,155
What does "deadlocked" mean?

301
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,201
It's when the jury
can't agree on a verdict.

302
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,155
-Uh-huh. And "if"?
-A conjunction meaning

303
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,166
"in the event that"
Or "on condition that."

304
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:02,208
So if we don't all
vote the same way,

305
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,054
we'll be deadlocked

306
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,970
and have to be
sequestered

307
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,760
in the Springfield
Palace hotel.

308
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,763
That's not
gonna happen, Homer.

309
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,965
Let's vote.
My liver is failing.

310
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,426
Where we'll get:

311
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,556
A free room, free food,
free swimming pool,

312
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,603
free HBO--
Ooh! "Free Willy"!

313
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,607
Justice is not
a frivolous thing, Simpson.

314
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,189
It has little, if anything,
to do with a disobedient whale.

315
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,534
Now let's vote.

316
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,899
Uh, how are
the rest of you voting?

317
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,486
-Guilty.
-Okay, fine.

318
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,411
-How many s's in "innocent"?
-(groaning)

319
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,871
I'm only doing
what I think is right.

320
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:39,162
I believe Freddy Quimby should
walk out of here a free hotel.

321
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,504
Oh, I miss you too, Marge.

322
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:50,297
But the law needs me.
I'll be home as soon as I can.

323
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,394
Room service, send up
two more pot roasts

324
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,059
and three more pillows
with mints on 'em.

325
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,055
You know,
(chuckles)

326
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,153
We're kind of like
the original odd couple.

327
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,938
You're the messy one,
and I'm--

328
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,062
Shut up!

329
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,818
Oh, yes.
Very well.

330
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,109
-(Itchy and Scratchy theme)
-So, Bart,

331
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,953
have your insides been
gnawed away by guilt yet?

332
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,740
Sell it to hallmark, sis.

333
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,703
You're looking
at cucumber boy.

334
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,243
As in, "Cool as a."

335
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,116
<i>ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i>Next on "McGarnigal"--</i>

336
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,753
<i>McGarnigal is framed for</i>
<i>a crime he didn't commit.</i>

337
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,331
<i>And only one witness</i>

338
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:27,127
<i>a little sissy boy who's too</i>

339
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,212

340
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,048

341
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,514

<i>McGarnigal.</i>

342
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:39,306
<i>Okay. For you,</i>
<i>McGarnigal.</i>

343
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:43,481
<i>Well, McGarnigal,</i>
<i>Billy is dead!</i>

344
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,862
<i>They slit his throat</i>
<i>from ear to ear.</i>

345
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:49,319
<i>Hey, I'm trying</i>
<i>to eat lunch here.</i>

346
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,369
Jump, Free Willy! Jump.

347
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,199
Jump with all your might.

348
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,666
<i>Ahh--</i>

349
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,460
<i>-(screams)</i>
<i>-(splats)</i>

350
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,803
WOMAN: <i>Oh, no.</i>
<i>Willy didn't make it!</i>

351
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,758
<i>And he crushed our boy!</i>

352
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,378
MAN: <i>Ugh! What a mess.</i>

353
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,925
Oh! I don't like this
new director's cut.

354
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,810
(straining)

355
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,968
-Got it, Barn?
-Got what?

356
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,767
-(crashes)
-Ow!

357
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,020
-You're stealing a table?
-I'm not stealin' it.

358
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,523
Hotels expect you
to take a few things. It's a souvenir.

359
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,146
Ah. Is that my necktie
you're wearing?

360
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,113
Souvenir.

361
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,612
(humming)

362
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,203
Mom, what if there's
a really bad, crummy guy

363
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,159
who's going to jail,
but I know he's innocent.

364
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,580
Well, Bart, your Uncle Arthur
used to have a saying,

365
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,950
"Shoot 'em all,
and let God sort 'em out."

366
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:45,037
Unfortunately, one day he put
his theory into practice.

367
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,254
It took 75 federal marshals
to bring him down.

368
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,384
Now, let's never
speak of him again.

369
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,131
(humming)

370
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,050
Mom? Mom!

371
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,465
-Mom!
-Hmm?

372
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,933
What if I can get
this guy off the hook?

373
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,973
I mean,
sh-should I do it?

374
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,727
Honey, you should listen
to your heart

375
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,310
and not
the voices in your head,

376
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,566
like a certain uncle did
one gray December morn.

377
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,359
(humming)

378
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,532
(sighs)

379
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,951
Even though reopening
a trial at this point

380
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,410
is illegal and grossly
unconstitutional,

381
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,792
I just can't
say no to kids.

382
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,200
(gavel bangs)

383
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,668
So, young man,

384
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:30,748
if Freddy Quimby didn't inflict
these injuries on Mr. Lacoste,

385
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,756
just who did?

386
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,589
Well, I was hiding in the kitchen
when it all happened.

387
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,385
Say it, Frenchy!
Say "chowdah"!

388
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,849
-Never!
-Okay, you asked for it.

389
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,850
I'm gonna enjoy this.

390
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,022
(grunting)

391
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,690
(scoffs)

392
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:49,899
Ooh, ooh!

393
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,980
(grunting)

394
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,200
(screams)

395
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,124
(screams)

396
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
-(traps snapping)
-Ow, ooh. Ow, ooh. Ow, ooh.

397
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,714
And that's what really happened.

398
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,254
This is an outrage!

399
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,418
I am not a clumsy
Clouseau-esque waiter!

400
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,547
I will--
Whoa! Whoo! Whoo!

401
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,136
(screaming)

402
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,891
Ooh! Ow! Ow! Ow!

403
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,353
At least there
were no big ones.

404
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,104
-(loud snap)
-MAN: <i>Ay.</i>

405
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,896
How could you have
seen all this, Bart?

406
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,559
Weren't you supposed
to be in school?

407
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,688
(inhales)

408
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,855
I... sorta skipped school.

409
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,815
I knew it! I knew you'd slip up
sooner or later, Simpson!

410
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,156
What slipup?
What are you talking about?

411
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,161
He confessed it.

412
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,912
Quiet.
I need this.

413
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:48,623
This court finds Freddy Quimby
innocent of all charges.

414
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,955
-(gavel slams)
-Case dismissed.

415
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,791
(cheering)

416
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,297
Bart, I'm impressed with
what you did in there.

417
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,012
You testified for
the Quimby boy,

418
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,342
even though it was putting
your own head in a noose.

419
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,597
On the other hand,
you skipped school.

420
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,770
I guess the two things
cancel each other out, huh.

421
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,179
(sighs)

422
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,688
I'm a small man
in some ways, Bart.

423
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,310
A small, petty man.

424
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,518
Three months detention.

425
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,477
(groans)

426
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,699
Wait a minute, Bart.

427
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,699
Make that...

428
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,371
four months detention.

429
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,748
{\an8}HOMER:
Well, Marge, it was horrible.

430
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,159
{\an8}Everyone was against me
in that jury room.

431
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,498
{\an8}But I stood by the courage
of my convictions,

432
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,963
{\an8}and I prevailed.

433
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:38,713
And that's why we had
Chinese food for lunch.

434
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,717
Good for you, Homey.

435
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,759
You know, a lot of things
happened around here

436
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,053
while you were gone.

437
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,926
Great, Marge.
I want to hear all about it.

438
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,314
(chuckles)

439
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,390
MARGE: Give me those!

440
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,604
(glasses snap, Homer groans)

441
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,604
-And those.
-(snap, groan)

442
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,266
-And those.
-(snap, groan)

443
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,411
{\an8}♪♪

444
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,410
Shh!
