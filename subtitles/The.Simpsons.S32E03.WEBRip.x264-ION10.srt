1
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:25,359
I think you better stay home
from school, sweetie.

2
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:26,793
I'm not at school?

3
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,863
No, honey.
And you should stay home.

4
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,398
Yes, Miss Hoover.

5
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,267
I put some books beside the bed.

6
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,502
Will you test me on them later?

7
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:38,872
Of course. And I won't even
give you any warning.

8
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:41,174
I'd like that.

9
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:01,628
Born near Florence, Italy,
in the year 1452,

10
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,231
Leonardo da Vinci
displayed a genius

11
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:06,833
unmatched in human history.

12
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,101
Extra, extra!

13
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,203
Renaissance begins today!

14
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,740
If you're gonna torture someone,
do it quick!

15
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:17,678
As a child,
Lisanardo's gifts were evident.

16
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,745
Hey, sonny boy,

17
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:22,249
I want you to be
just as talented as her.

18
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:23,884
I made an Uffizi

19
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,886
on the floor of the Farnese.

20
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,988
Yeah, yeah.
That's... That's great.

21
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,990
Lisanardo, did you finish

22
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:33,427
that drawing of the suspect yet?

23
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,131
That talented kid

24
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,133
is gonna make you
a lot of money.

25
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,969
We're rich!

26
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,538
Like Marge's tomato sauce.

27
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,540
Not until dinner.

28
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:49,643
While we're celebrating
Saint Christopher,

29
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,679
he help people
who get lost telling stories

30
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,581
find their way back
to the point.

31
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:58,418
He was canonized
by Gregory the Inconvenient,

32
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,687
who shot him out of the cannon.

33
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:03,757
This was before
they discovered gunpowder,

34
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:07,794
so they pulled the cannon
to a cliff and pointed down.

35
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,630
But then he stayed in.

36
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:13,100
They had to give him
an eviction notice.

37
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,568
Florence, at the time,

38
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,637
was at the start
of the Renaissance.

39
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,573
Hey, you can never
be too careful.

40
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,641
Aw, don't worry.

41
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,943
Those Dark Ages
ain't never coming back.

42
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,811
We got frescoes, we got spinach

43
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,248
and this delicious new thing
called a pizza.

44
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,884
I'm the original Ray.

45
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,353
Well, I am‐a Famous Ray.

46
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,621
Basta!

47
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,428
What about me, Little‐a Caesar?

48
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,063
Pizza! Pizza!

49
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,065
Ouchie! Ouchie!

50
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,567
Et tu, Noidus?

51
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,870
Young Lisanardo
was soon an apprentice

52
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,339
to the most famous artist
in Florence,

53
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,708
Andrea del Verrocchio.

54
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,443
Whoever paints
the sweetest cherub

55
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,713
will have the honor of having
my name signed on their work.

56
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,715
That's what great artists do.

57
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:06,019
Excellent, Barticelli.

58
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:08,188
Very nice, Dolphatello.

59
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,156
Ralphael, what is this?

60
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,026
My foot hands are brushes.

61
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,098
Jesus.

62
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:21,401
Your little angels are
so much better than my Jesus.

63
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,803
- Is that wrong?
- No.

64
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,706
Your genius has shown me
what a failure I am.

65
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,576
I will never paint again.

66
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,616
At least there are no geniuses
in here.

67
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,324
What?
We can't all be great.

68
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,725
Right, Mediocroto?

69
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,528
Si. On every paper,
I get a C.

70
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,698
We don't want you in our class.
You're too much better than us.

71
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,567
Yeah, your gifts
come from heaven above.

72
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,036
That's not true.

73
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,373
Here's some more talent.

74
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,375
Not a good time.

75
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,180
<i>My gifts came down
from God above</i>

76
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,685
<i>But talent
doesn't bring you love</i>

77
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:16,289
<i>Although
my brilliant genius shone</i>

78
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:20,560
<i>My last supper was all alone</i>

79
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:24,764
<i>In 1470</i>

80
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,604
If you can't beat 'em, kill 'em.

81
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,441
Use your genius
to invent weapons of war,

82
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,410
just like I'm gonna invent
the Charleston.

83
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,217
Ow, my appendages!

84
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,719
I'll show them all.

85
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,355
I'll show them all
in a secret diary

86
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,691
that no one will decipher
for 400 years.

87
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:59,833
Oh, what to invent?
What to invent?

88
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,543
Portable siege engines.

89
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,278
Flamethrowing mirrors.

90
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,647
A waterpowered stabbing wheel.

91
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,516
With these,
we could kill

92
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,385
the most evil people
in the world.

93
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,854
Slightly different Christians.

94
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,395
This is your true masterpiece.

95
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,397
Why did you kill us?

96
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,598
Scusi.

97
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,541
I'm going to kill you all.

98
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,777
It's my only pathway to pope.

99
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,779
Cardinals suck.

100
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,314
Go, Cubs!

101
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,849
Lisanardo had learned

102
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,585
that using her intellect
for war was blasphemy

103
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:56,222
but using it for art
would make it endure forever.

104
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,093
She escaped to France
and retired in happiness.

105
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,863
I'll be out in a sec.
Keep the engine running.

106
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,435
Lisanardo,
I have many questions.

107
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,570
Why are you hitting yourself?

108
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,672
A nerd says what?
And how is it possible

109
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:16,543
that I am rubber and you are
glue, et cetera, et cetera?

110
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,545
I will answer all questions

111
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:22,515
just as soon as I finish
my masterpiece, my king.

112
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:26,419
<i>Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa</i>

113
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:30,090
<i>Men have named you</i>

114
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:33,827
<i>You're so like the lady
with the mystic smile</i>

115
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:37,163
Well, if this doesn't get
Ron Howard to direct,

116
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,765
I don't know what will.

117
00:06:41,302 --> 00:06:44,480
Real humble, Lis, making
yourself into Leonardo da Vinci.

118
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,272
Shouldn't you be in school?

119
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,707
It was art, which I hate.

120
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,576
Well, if you hate
the formal study of art,

121
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,978
you're just like another artist
I'd like to discuss

122
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,547
who also had trouble
with the Academy.

123
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,049
You must have a fever,

124
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:59,018
because that segue was sweaty.

125
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:03,857
Unimaginative and boring.

126
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,191
A.

127
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,594
Milhouse, this has nothing
I haven't seen before.

128
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,660
A‐plus.

129
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:09,805
Bart, you've really
made me think.

130
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,165
How dare you?
F‐minus.

131
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,806
Oh, a single entendre,

132
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,142
the most complicated joke
there is.

133
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,543
Class, settle, please,

134
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,111
because today
we have a special treat.

135
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,114
A visit from Paris'
leading Bacchus model.

136
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,416
Sorry I'm late.
As a supermodel,

137
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,753
I have to be eating
and drinking all day.

138
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:38,090
You prefer robe open
or robe off?

139
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:41,027
Just cover your privates
with this walnut shell.

140
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,496
Whoa, so roomy.

141
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,866
That looks nothing like him.

142
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,968
And it shouldn't. We're making
the art that we feel

143
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,736
because we can't compete
with a camera,

144
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,639
especially
modern compact cameras.

145
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,876
Please hold still for 17 hours.

146
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,744
Since you refuse
to paint the still life,

147
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,913
you'll become the still life.

148
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,517
Foie gras!

149
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:14,694
This epoque just gets beller
and beller.

150
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,296
Who is that kid?

151
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:18,865
I am Toulouse‐Moetrec,

152
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,701
the chronicler of the demimonde.

153
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,136
I keep liquor in my cane.

154
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:29,008
Not very efficient.
Really not.

155
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,212
Coq au vin, au vin!

156
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,553
This is the greatest thing
I've ever seen,

157
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,722
and I have seen, like,
five things!

158
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,091
You, my friend.
You are a genius!

159
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:48,694
Maybe we should stop
slavishly following the teacher

160
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,429
and use our own minds

161
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,732
to slavishly follow Bart.

162
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,166
To the easels.

163
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,538
All right, time to do
my first self‐portrait.

164
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:01,908
Time to look in a mirror
for the first time in my life.

165
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,677
I can only assume
that I am beautiful.

166
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,546
All right, here we go.

167
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,281
Looking now.

168
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,321
Oh, don't worry, sir.

169
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,199
You won't see anything here
that'll encourage debate,

170
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,926
provoke thought or be out
of place in a dentist's office.

171
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,694
Ah, well,
I'm sure this will have

172
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,064
a definite je ne sais quoi?!

173
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:31,804
The emperor is coming here
to look at this artwork today.

174
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,574
His Majesty will feed us
to the guillotine!

175
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,609
That hasn't been used in years.

176
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,711
No one even remembers
how to work it.

177
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,914
Pull up, let go.
How hard can that be?

178
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,951
Mon cher, le superintendent,

179
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,588
which of our works will you be
entering into the royal salon?

180
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:51,591
None.
You are all refusés.

181
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,159
What about our student loans?

182
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,728
Oh, they'll be refunded.
We are not barbarians.

183
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,263
I mean, come on.

184
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,366
Oh, if only we could get our art
in front of the emperor.

185
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,603
Monarchs love challenges
to the established order.

186
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,871
No, no.
But there is one thing

187
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,840
the emperor loves
more than anything.

188
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,343
- France?
- No, he hates France.

189
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,612
But he loves cheese.

190
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:16,048
Look who he appointed
mayor of Toulon.

191
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,627
Do we have a winner?

192
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,895
Keep your pants on, Moulin Huge.

193
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:34,166
There are 44 more galleries
of mediocre art to judge.

194
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,069
What is that cheese doing?

195
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,772
Oh, you know French cheese.
Very runny.

196
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,608
I warned them not to make cheese
into wheels.

197
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,477
Cubes were fine.

198
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,479
I get motion sickness,

199
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,781
and I'm lactose intolerant.

200
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,651
Hurry.
He's biting his way in!

201
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,921
What the...

202
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,192
Aw, once again,

203
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,596
I have just cheese
that is not cheese.

204
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,598
Your Majesty,
if you'll take a seat,

205
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,867
we'll show you something
really special,

206
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:11,037
a transformation of art
from a rote copying of nature

207
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,239
into the experiences, ideas,

208
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,041
and mind of the artist.

209
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:18,010
You had me at take a seat.

210
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:21,714
I don't know art,
but I know what I like.

211
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,717
And I like eating
and not looking at art.

212
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:28,521
I hereby award you
the Royal Medallion.

213
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:31,724
Congratulations
on your discerning eye,

214
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,725
Your Majesty.

215
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,427
I love this pupil.

216
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:38,297
Is this not the student that you
expelled from the royal salon?

217
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,333
Well, I... That is, I...

218
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,536
Just pretend I'm not here.

219
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:47,039
Sir, is your tongue
sticking out because you're dead

220
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,807
or because you're mad at me?

221
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,342
Little of both.

222
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,644
Yeah.

223
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,289
Oh, sure, Maggie.
That's easy.

224
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:08,027
Renaissance artists love to put
babies in their paintings,

225
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:09,695
especially baby angels.

226
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,531
Let's just not think about why
there were so many babies

227
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,433
in heaven, shall we?

228
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,184
Hey!

229
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,175
Damn it!

230
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:58,710
So, telling stories
about art, huh?

231
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,780
Do they have one about a fat guy
whose wife is too good for him?

232
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,048
Stupid fat guy.

233
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,317
Bet he doesn't even know
what's going on.

234
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:09,321
Well, Dad, have you ever heard
of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo?

235
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,056
Lisa, I haven't even heard

236
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,659
of Jackson Pollock
and Lee Krasner.

237
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:18,030
Well, Diego and Frida
were married in 1929.

238
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:24,903
I now pronounce
you esposo and esposa.

239
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,639
You may now beso quite mucho.

240
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,912
Spanish for best wishes!

241
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,748
Spanish for congratulations!

242
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,051
Spanish for muy bueno!

243
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,786
Amigos, familia,

244
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,421
and El Barto.

245
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,723
<i>Barto, El Barto</i>

246
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,893
<i>The fox so cunning and free</i>

247
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,062
The mysterious El Barto.

248
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,464
Do you know
nobleman Don Bartholomew?

249
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:55,901
He lives in that house
you come out of every night.

250
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,303
Ay, caramba!

251
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,506
Gosh, quite the swordsman.

252
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:01,740
Slashed my shirt,

253
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,009
did not even nick me.

254
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,145
Move along, folks!

255
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:08,413
It's gonna take me a while
to bleed out.

256
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,749
That's clever...

257
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,551
a B.

258
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,154
I know I speak for my wife,
Frida Kahlo,

259
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,157
when I say I couldn't imagine
life without you.

260
00:14:18,223 --> 00:14:20,659
But I also speak for my wife,
Frida Kahlo,

261
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,729
when I say we leave
for New York tomorrow!

262
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:25,030
You never asked me!

263
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,798
Don't worry.
As a woman,

264
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:31,203
you will be treated with
much more respect in America.

265
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:36,074
Diego, I know
you are a socialist,

266
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,677
whilst I am
a lion of capitalism.

267
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,546
Yes, we hate the capitalists.

268
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:43,749
Right now,
a young socialist is being born

269
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:44,917
who will take them down.

270
00:14:44,983 --> 00:14:46,785
Mr. Bernie Sanders.

271
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,554
I hope he's quick about it.

272
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,924
Getting a cootie shot should not
cost your lunch money.

273
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,825
And if you don't listen to me,

274
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:55,761
listen to the Bernie Babies.

275
00:14:55,827 --> 00:14:58,330
What?
Everybody's got goons.

276
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,799
I disavow that and welcome it.

277
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,100
Señor Rockefeller,

278
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,736
what is it
you are looking for from Diego?

279
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,538
Frida, please!
I'm so sorry.

280
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,374
My wife does not understand
these discussions.

281
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:13,278
I understand
that he is paying you $21,000

282
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:16,281
for a mural
for his new Rockefeller Center

283
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,917
with the theme
man at the crossroads.

284
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,886
$21,000.

285
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,754
Do you know what that is
in today's money?

286
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,624
$21,000.

287
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,528
This entire area
will be your canvas.

288
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,897
I will need very tiny brushes,

289
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,398
a magnifying glass

290
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,801
and a huge bottle of tequila.

291
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:36,802
No worm.

292
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:38,270
A snake.

293
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,981
You drive a hard bargain,

294
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,540
but this is just a model.

295
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,443
The real Rockefeller Center
will be 66 stories high.

296
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:48,780
And every Christmas, we will
kill and decorate a giant tree

297
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:52,084
as a warning to the other trees.

298
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:56,922
Oh, Frida.
Let us celebrate our triumph

299
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,890
with some snuggle‐issimo.

300
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:01,026
- No.
- What's wrong, my dear?

301
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,761
Is your unibrow hurting?

302
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,497
You are selling out, my love.

303
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,167
I am not selling out!

304
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,637
I am doing this mural
for the little guy!

305
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:13,438
People like him!

306
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:16,241
Why are you washing windows
at night?

307
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,910
Who said I was washing windows?

308
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,748
As for you, squander your gift,

309
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:24,416
spit on your talent.

310
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,686
I am glad we are in agreement.

311
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,289
But what will I do
while you work on your mural?

312
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:31,923
Paint a happy self‐portrait,

313
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,592
smiling ear to ear,

314
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,127
not a care in the world.

315
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:37,629
That's not who I am, Diego!

316
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,031
I love you too.

317
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:41,300
Going to the bar!

318
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,436
Paint.
Paint your misery.

319
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,205
Also, leave.
Leave your husband.

320
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,207
Which one of you is the angel?

321
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,351
- We both are.
- We both are.

322
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,344
That's how mad you're feeling.

323
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,048
Back to Heaven!

324
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,619
Buenas noches, darling.

325
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,387
What a crazy night I had.

326
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:05,590
Now we got to get our stories
straight about Zeppo.

327
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,859
It was an accident, okay?

328
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,764
Starting a new painting?

329
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:16,234
Yes.
I am painting my feelings.

330
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,972
So strong, so brave,

331
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,708
so true to herself.

332
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,646
My darling, I am not
half the artist you are.

333
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,148
Diego, what are you saying?

334
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,485
I am saying I've underestimated
you all this time.

335
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,653
You are a genius!

336
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,656
From now on,
I will show my awe of you

337
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,257
by sleeping with other women.

338
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:40,959
Starting an hour ago.

339
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,995
And I will sleep with other
women starting two hours ago.

340
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:46,698
I'm so glad
I don't hear what you say.

341
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:50,635
But I will do something I have
not done in our entire marriage.

342
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,304
What you want.

343
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,906
Well, actions speak louder
than words.

344
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:58,243
No. Unless the action is the
demolition of a big building,

345
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,945
words are usually louder.

346
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:01,713
Everything is a fight.

347
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,315
I completely disagree.

348
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:05,450
But just wait
till you see what I do.

349
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,452
You'll be pleased
with what I do not do,

350
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,654
and you will love what I do do.

351
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:10,789
Good night!

352
00:18:12,857 --> 00:18:15,093
Welcome to Rockefeller Center,

353
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,494
a temple of capitalism.

354
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:18,196
To find a taller building,

355
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,465
you'd have to walk
a full seven blocks.

356
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,100
Long blocks.

357
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,668
With people bumping you.

358
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:27,205
Enough already. While the art
is still deco, okay?

359
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,675
For you, my darling.

360
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:33,244
Man at the Crossroads.

361
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,614
Rich people.
Yes, excellent.

362
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,116
The cosmos.
Yes, makes sense.

363
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,417
A worker.

364
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:41,219
Well, I suppose
it couldn't be helped.

365
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,520
Fascist army.

366
00:18:42,587 --> 00:18:44,923
Always welcome in any lobby.

367
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,292
Who's that fellow?

368
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:50,428
With the beard
and the Bolshevik smile.

369
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:54,032
That is the founder
of Soviet Russia, Lenin.

370
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:55,834
But... But he's a communist.

371
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,136
Oh, he just attended
a couple of meetings.

372
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:01,306
I can't have a communist
in my colossus of capitalism.

373
00:19:01,372 --> 00:19:02,540
Paint over it.

374
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:03,607
No!

375
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:05,009
Then you will lose
your commission,

376
00:19:05,076 --> 00:19:07,812
and I won't let you be
the model for Atlas.

377
00:19:10,448 --> 00:19:11,883
I don't care.

378
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,752
There is one person
I want to be proud of me,

379
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:15,987
no matter what.

380
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,556
Oh, my darling.

381
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:21,092
Release the hounds.

382
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:24,562
They're on the 66th floor, sir.

383
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:27,265
They should be here
in about 25 minutes.

384
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:33,438
But why is it
just sitting there?

385
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:35,173
I...
I think they may be eating

386
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,008
the elevator operator, sir.

387
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,710
Let us leave, my darling,

388
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:40,979
with our scruples intact.

389
00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:42,447
Push the owner's button.

390
00:19:42,513 --> 00:19:44,582
- But...
- I said push it.

391
00:19:47,952 --> 00:19:49,387
Ironically, in time,

392
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,789
Frida became more famous
than Diego,

393
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:55,593
an icon for brilliant
female artists everywhere.

394
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,329
This is really, really good.

395
00:19:58,396 --> 00:19:59,864
If I play my cards right,

396
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:03,067
I will direct a Rick and Morty.

397
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:15,713
All right, now it's time for
the story of Vincent van Moe.

398
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,884
<i>Bar‐ry, bar‐ry night</i>

399
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:24,822
<i>Squeeze your bar rag
clean and dry</i>

400
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:28,426
<i>For the last time,
say there's no Wi‐Fi</i>

401
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:33,331
<i>With eyes that know
the darkness of my soul</i>

402
00:20:34,632 --> 00:20:38,703
<i>Serving them the dregs</i>

403
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,571
<i>Something's growing</i>

404
00:20:40,638 --> 00:20:43,641
<i>On my eggs</i>

405
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,778
<i>Add tap water to the kegs</i>

406
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:51,049
<i>And search the bushes
for my missing ear</i>

407
00:20:52,817 --> 00:20:55,987
<i>Now the show is done</i>

408
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,690
<i>Except the part</i>

409
00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:01,926
<i>Where the chick goes "shh"</i>

410
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:05,930
<i>But no one ever obeys her</i>

411
00:21:05,997 --> 00:21:10,068
<i>'Cause, really,
what's she shushing for?</i>

412
00:21:10,134 --> 00:21:11,569
This one ain't so great.

413
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:13,705
<i>I will not listen</i>

414
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:17,008
<i>She's not the boss of me</i>

415
00:21:18,943 --> 00:21:23,681
<i>And she will never be</i>

416
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,886
End the credits!
