00:07:08,837 --> 00:07:11,746
She texted us she fell off
the roof cleaning the gutters.

182
00:07:11,748 --> 00:07:15,082
I lied about that
to get you all here together.

183
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,993
I did clean the gutters, though.

184
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:18,845
And I did fall off the roof.

185
00:07:18,922 --> 00:07:20,346
After all these years,

186
00:07:20,423 --> 00:07:24,017
it's obvious I can't get the
three of you to stop fighting.

187
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:25,502
[tires screech]

188
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:28,071
But I think
I found someone who can.

189
00:07:28,932 --> 00:07:31,766
Homer, Patty, Selma,

190
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:33,343
by the time I'm done with you,

191
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:35,862
you'll be as close
as a family can be.

192
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:37,080
[all shriek]

193
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:43,703
Marge, dear,
what's the who, why and how

194
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,038
of this family row?

195
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,132
Well, it's complicated.

196
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,542
I hate jerks,
and they hate cool guys.

197
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:50,710
End of story.

198
00:07:50,787 --> 00:07:52,712
We didn't like each other
from the start.

199
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:57,458
But things got really ugly
at that fateful baby shower.

200
00:07:57,536 --> 00:08:00,628
[Selma]
<i>We wanted that day to be perfect</i>
<i> for our sister.</i>

201
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,056
<i> -And it was.</i>
-[Patty]<i> Until this idiot</i>

202
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:05,892
<i> botched the one and only job</i>
<i> we'd given him.</i>

203
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:06,985
I got the cake!

204
00:08:07,062 --> 00:08:08,712
[yelping]

205
00:08:08,714 --> 00:08:10,380
We said a carrot cake!

206
00:08:10,382 --> 00:08:12,991
I know. But chocolate is
me and Marge's favorite.

207
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,217
[hyperventilating]

208
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:16,661
Luckily I brought
a backup carrot cake

209
00:08:16,738 --> 00:08:19,498
because I knew
the Impreginator here

210
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,815
would screw it up.

211
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:21,816
[Selma and Homer grunt]

212
00:08:21,893 --> 00:08:23,484
You undermining land hags!

213
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:24,652
What's the matter?

214
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,912
You tell these traitors

215
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:28,006
that your favorite cake
is chocolate

216
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,233
and that you despise carrot cake

217
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:32,919
because it's a garden salad
with frosting!

218
00:08:33,071 --> 00:08:34,754
It's fine. It's fine.

219
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:35,922
Please don't fight.

220
00:08:35,924 --> 00:08:37,757
[moaning]

221
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,242
Mm-hmm. See? See?

222
00:08:39,244 --> 00:08:40,910
I like both cakes.

223
00:08:40,912 --> 00:08:41,928
No, she doesn't!

224
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,763
Eat wrong cake!

225
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,982
[grunting]

226
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,085
[Marge]
<i>It was at that moment I realized</i>

227
00:08:49,087 --> 00:08:53,773
<i> the only solution was to keep</i>
<i>my husband and sisters separated</i>

228
00:08:53,775 --> 00:08:55,592
<i> from then on.</i>

229
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,976
So, Marge, who was right?

230
00:08:57,054 --> 00:08:59,496
What is
your favorite cake flavor?

231
00:09:00,857 --> 00:09:02,648
It's neither! I like vanilla!

232
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:03,783
Only vanilla!

233
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,102
The less flavor, the better.

234
00:09:06,104 --> 00:09:08,380
Vanilla is the opposite
of chocolate!

235
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:10,048
Carrot is the opposite of cake!

236
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,776
Marge ruined her life
when she met you!

237
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:15,887
Shut up! I've heard enough
of your bip-da-bip-da-bip!

238
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,297
You three disgust me.

239
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:19,949
May you walk
under a falling air conditioner.

240
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:22,452
That said, the problem...

241
00:09:22,454 --> 00:09:23,636
is you!

242
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:24,637
[all gasp]

243
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,638
Me?

244
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,123
How can I be the problem?

245
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,958
I'm the Marge of this!

246
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,460
Oh, please.

247
00:09:30,462 --> 00:09:32,553
If you actually wanted peace,

248
00:09:32,631 --> 00:09:34,314
you'd stop interfering.

249
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:37,150
Let these three lunatics
work out their mishegoss

250
00:09:37,226 --> 00:09:38,743
among themselves.

251
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,654
Why on earth
would I want them to fight?

252
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:43,323
So you could be the martyr.

253
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:46,567
You keep them separated
so they<i> won't</i> stop fighting.

254
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:49,254
God forbid they should ever bury
the hatchet and, who knows...

255
00:09:49,331 --> 00:09:50,830
[chuckles]
become friends.

256
00:09:50,907 --> 00:09:54,818
Because then St. Marge
doesn't get to run the show.

257
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,243
-[Marge] Aah!
-[clattering]
-[Santa's Little Helper howls]

258
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,262
-[Lisa] Hey!
-[glass shatters]
-[Snowball II yowls]

259
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,597
[Marge]
Lamp. [grunts]

260
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,415
That's the craziest thing
I ever heard!

261
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:02,508
I'm the nicest!

262
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:03,918
I love everyone!

263
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:06,104
Out! Out! Out, out! Get out!

264
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:08,607
I un-sign all the waivers!

265
00:10:08,683 --> 00:10:10,500
Shh, shoo, shoo, shoo!

266
00:10:10,502 --> 00:10:14,520
This is what showbiz is
all about, huh, Wayne the Grip?

267
00:10:14,597 --> 00:10:15,505
The camaraderie.

268
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:16,597
Huh? Why do you know my name?

269
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:18,174
Please don't fire me.

270
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:21,194
I need to support my stepson's
illegal street racing habit.

271
00:10:21,196 --> 00:10:23,622
Relax, my fruit-vaping friend.

272
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:24,956
I'm just like you--

273
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:27,367
a member of the crew family.

274
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:29,461
Really? You always seemed
like you couldn't stand

275
00:10:29,537 --> 00:10:30,945
us below-the-line guys.

276
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:32,613
[groans]
What I can't stand

277
00:10:32,691 --> 00:10:35,041
is that old-fashioned
Hollywood expression.

278
00:10:35,118 --> 00:10:38,044
Why should there be
some imaginary line separating

279
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:39,379
the so-called "talent"

280
00:10:39,531 --> 00:10:41,622
from the hardworking riffraff
like you?

281
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:46,144
If I could, I'd make it
so the line never existed.

282
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,129
[chuckles]
That's pretty cool of you, man.

283
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:51,541
You know, I'm hosting a crawfish
boil this weekend for the crew.

284
00:10:51,543 --> 00:10:52,709
You should come.

285
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:54,711
You're inviting me

286
00:10:54,713 --> 00:10:56,637
to your that?

287
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,156
Just watch out
for my friend Jimmy.

288
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,808
He will flick you in the nuts
if you're not looking.

289
00:11:00,886 --> 00:11:03,386
I look forward to it.

290
00:11:03,388 --> 00:11:06,389
Where does that judgmental
old clown-aunt

291
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:08,333
get off saying I'm the problem?

292
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,077
How can I be the reason
you three don't get along?

293
00:11:11,229 --> 00:11:12,912
[chuckles]
That lady's off her rocker.

294
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:14,321
Thank you, sweetie.

295
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,916
You always know
how to agree with me.

296
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:19,260
Yes, I do.

297
00:11:20,572 --> 00:11:22,422
[scoffs]
As if there were a world

298
00:11:22,498 --> 00:11:25,499
where I'd be friends
with my worst enemies.

299
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:30,355
<i> Hmm. Friends with Patty</i>
<i> and Selma.</i>

300
00:11:45,597 --> 00:11:47,688
<i>What are you doing here, Homer?</i>

301
00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:48,781
<i> This isn't you.</i>

302
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,167
<i> You're not this person.</i>

303
00:11:51,937 --> 00:11:53,770
So, here we all are.

304
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:56,606
If I could have stayed away,
I would have.

305
00:11:56,624 --> 00:11:58,107
Part of me wants to run.

306
00:11:58,109 --> 00:12:00,201
Part of me knows
I'm through running.

307
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,464
Do you think there's any truth
to what the mean lady said,

308
00:12:04,616 --> 00:12:08,301
that we would be friends
if not for Marge?

309
00:12:08,303 --> 00:12:10,303
I know I don't want
to believe it.

310
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,622
We need to figure out
if this is real.

311
00:12:12,624 --> 00:12:15,549
I know a place where
we can explore these feelings

312
00:12:15,627 --> 00:12:17,977
discreetly.

313
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:21,197
Patty and Selma,
welcome to Moe's.

314
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,151
Weird how the sunlight stops
at the doorway,

315
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:26,970
like it's afraid to come in.

316
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:29,748
Yeah, a scientist tried
to explain it one time

317
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,207
and went crazy.

318
00:12:32,143 --> 00:12:33,493
[Moe]
Homer. Psst. Homer.

319
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:36,162
Hey, I said "Psst."

320
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:38,757
Who are these two goddesses?

321
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,074
They're Marge's sisters.

322
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:43,077
Midge has two hotter sisters?

323
00:12:43,154 --> 00:12:44,988
Patty and Selma.

324
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,097
Pidge and Sidge?

325
00:12:46,174 --> 00:12:48,082
Well, yeah, they're twins.

326
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,993
Oh, my God. Twins?

327
00:12:49,995 --> 00:12:51,752
I always dreamed of hooking up
with twins.

328
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:55,589
Ever since I saw that old
commercial for the movie<i> Twins.</i>

329
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,275
Patty's a lesbian,
so I don't think--

330
00:12:57,352 --> 00:13:00,094
And one of 'em has
zero interest in men?

331
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,096
I think I'm in love over here.

332
00:13:02,098 --> 00:13:03,523
How could you keep this from me?

333
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:04,741
How could you do it?

334
00:13:09,697 --> 00:13:12,290
[all murmuring]

335
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:15,868
All these years we treated
each other like garbage.

336
00:13:15,945 --> 00:13:17,611
But it was Marge's fault.

337
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:21,132
I hope we can find it
in ourselves to forgive her.

338
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:23,951
Seeing as we're such great
people, we probably will.

339
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:27,263
To the three... amigos?

340
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:32,793
Four. You're so fat,
you count twice.

341
00:13:32,871 --> 00:13:34,053
Zing!

342
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,872
-[all laughing]
-Twice.

343
00:13:35,874 --> 00:13:39,225
Said the spinster with
a toilet brush for a head.

344
00:13:39,302 --> 00:13:40,819
Zing!

345
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:42,061
[all laughing]

346
00:13:42,063 --> 00:13:43,379
-Good one.
-Now that we're buddies,

347
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:47,075
our horrible insults
are just delightful zings.

348
00:13:48,644 --> 00:13:50,720
Look, Homer, it's your head.

349
00:13:50,738 --> 00:13:52,722
It's even got your IQ.

350
00:13:52,724 --> 00:13:53,814
Zing!

351
00:13:53,892 --> 00:13:55,816
[metallic scraping]

352
00:13:55,894 --> 00:14:00,821
[Homer straining]
It's like I'm being crushed
by two sacks of wet mail.

353
00:14:00,823 --> 00:14:02,757
[Patty and Selma]
Zing!

354
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,919
Did you have to audition
for this part

355
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:08,921
or did your agent
just get a call?

356
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:10,473
[whispers]
Zing.

357
00:14:11,743 --> 00:14:14,594
38 minutes. No hints.

358
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,670
I stayed out of the way.

359
00:14:16,748 --> 00:14:18,005
Homer?

360
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,432
[all yelp]
Marge!

361
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:23,252
[muffled] Dad, are you hanging
out with Patty and Selma?

362
00:14:23,254 --> 00:14:25,512
-[laughing nervously]
-No, the thing is...

363
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:27,348
It seems like you guys
are friends.

364
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:29,534
-[stammering nervously]
-Wh-Why would I...

365
00:14:29,611 --> 00:14:33,520
If you guys are getting along
without me,

366
00:14:33,598 --> 00:14:35,781
the problem<i> is</i> me.

367
00:14:35,783 --> 00:14:37,625

368
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,790
-Open. Open.
-[munching]

369
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:45,884
Friends.

370
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,201
[Patty]
Unlikely friends.

371
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:49,053
[Homer]
Remember, no splashing.

372
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,889
-[water splashing]
-[laughing] Oh, no.

373
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,633
Mom, you should go down
and join them.

374
00:14:53,635 --> 00:14:55,118
No, I'd only cause trouble

375
00:14:55,136 --> 00:14:56,877
because I'm the problem.

376
00:14:56,955 --> 00:14:57,729
[worried grunt]

377
00:14:57,805 --> 00:15:00,123
Of course you're not.

378
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,882
No, I am. It's fine, though.

379
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,218
Your father and my sisters
getting along was my dream

380
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:05,962
and it happened
and now my life is perfect.

381
00:15:05,964 --> 00:15:07,463
Hooray for TV therapy.

382
00:15:07,482 --> 00:15:08,764
Hooray, hooray, hooray.

383
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,724
So perfect that you're up here
watching them

384
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:13,970
while you refold laundry
that's already been folded.

385
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:16,656
Maybe I don't do things right
the first time.

386
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:18,750
Or any time.

387
00:15:18,826 --> 00:15:19,976
[Marge groaning]

388
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:22,253
Bart! Mom has candy!

389
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,238
Candy, candy, candy,
candy, candy.

390
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,757

[sobbing]

392
00:15:27,502 --> 00:15:30,503
I ruined everything.

393
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:33,389
Candy?

394
00:15:34,492 --> 00:15:36,100
[tires screech]

395

396
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:43,924
Krusty, you made it.

397
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:46,110
Like I'm not gonna
drive three hours

398
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,504
to be with my crew family.

399
00:15:48,506 --> 00:15:51,524
You got a little water prison
for the kids. Nice.

400
00:15:51,526 --> 00:15:52,842
Oh, it's a pool.

401
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:55,845
No, pools go in the ground.

402
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:57,196
Oh, you got to meet
my neighbors.

403
00:15:57,198 --> 00:15:58,848
That's Phil. He's a cop.

404
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,940
Joe, cop.

405
00:16:00,018 --> 00:16:01,851
Uh, cop, cop, cop.

406
00:16:01,853 --> 00:16:04,370
Uh, I love law enforcement.

407
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:05,964
And laws.

408
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:09,041
Hey! Little help, K-dawg?

409
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:10,710
Oh! I can do this.

410
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:12,862
I bet on this sport.

411
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:14,547
[grunts]

412
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:17,049

[crying]

415
00:16:21,873 --> 00:16:24,232
Walk it off, Jayden.
Walk it off.

416
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,047
The dunes
are calling your name, bro!

417
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:32,898
[grunting]

418
00:16:32,975 --> 00:16:34,975
-[laughter]
-[cheering]

419
00:16:35,053 --> 00:16:36,494
My stepson's stepson,

420
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:38,663
he built this baby out
of boat parts!

421
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,333
So, no brakes or safety features
to weigh you down.

422
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,227
Smart.

423
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:45,319
Is there a helmet?

424
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:48,064
Statistically,
you're safer without one.

425
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:49,823
Got to do your own research.

426
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,917
Okay, I can do this.

427
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:54,512
Just take it slow and steady.

428
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,758
-[yelps]
-[crashes]

429
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,910
Hey, the CPR worked!

430
00:17:00,912 --> 00:17:03,670
And when your heart stopped,
which heaven did you see?

431
00:17:03,748 --> 00:17:07,191
Jet Ski paintball next weekend
at Concrete Lake, K-dawg!

432
00:17:07,268 --> 00:17:08,084
You in?

433
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:10,361
Wouldn't miss it.

[announcer]
<i> It's</i> The Problem Is You

435
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:16,776
Season Finale Reunion Special!

436
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:18,703
[cheering, applause]

437
00:17:19,764 --> 00:17:21,097
Welcome!

438
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:24,691
On our first hit season,
we solved a lot of problems.

439
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,026
And here they are now!

440
00:17:26,104 --> 00:17:27,286
[audience cheers]

441
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:29,622
So, how's everybody doing?

442
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,958
Yes, well, when you find out
that you're the problem,

443
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:34,201
even though
you could have sworn--

444
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:36,537
and I mean with every fiber
of your being--

445
00:17:36,614 --> 00:17:39,206
that it was the other guy,
it's very, well,

446
00:17:39,284 --> 00:17:41,375
I don't know, freeing?
I don't know.

447
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,394
I was so controlling
of Percival.

448
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,397
But now I just let him
roam free.

449
00:17:46,474 --> 00:17:49,383
Oh, Aunt Sadie,
you changed all our lives.

450
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:53,145
Once you helped Marge step back
from decades of sabotaging us,

451
00:17:53,147 --> 00:17:54,964
it's been so good for her.

452
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:56,741
-Right, honey?
-That's right.

453
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,150
I'm gonna be honest.

454
00:17:58,227 --> 00:17:59,744
There was a time when I thought

455
00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:02,062
maybe we were doing
something wrong.

456
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,865
But we were
completely blameless.

457
00:18:04,976 --> 00:18:06,267
Not me. I'm to blame.

458
00:18:06,344 --> 00:18:07,752
The problem is Marge.

459
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:11,071
All those things that used to
bother me about Marge's sisters,

460
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:12,665
they just don't anymore.

461
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:14,258
I can remember, for example,

462
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,985
when I wouldn't be able to stand

463
00:18:15,987 --> 00:18:18,078
the way he's breathing
right now.

464
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:20,506
Oh. W-Was I breathing loud?

465
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,340
I'm sorry.

466
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:22,658
Doesn't bother me either.

467
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,845
Good, because the cigarette ash
in your eyebrows

468
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:26,920
doesn't bother me.

469
00:18:26,998 --> 00:18:28,272
I'm not sitting here, thinking,

470
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:30,608
"How could there be
so much of it?"

471
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:31,667
[Selma and Patty murmur]

472
00:18:31,686 --> 00:18:33,185
Kumiko, tell me,

473
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:36,021
is your husband still skipping
the episode "previously on"s

474
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:37,764
even though you find them
helpful?

475
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:40,509
You want to know something else
that doesn't bother me?

476
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,696
That he only cuts his
fingernails on his left hand.

477
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:47,291
I'm a righty, so I can't use
the clippers with my left!

478
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:51,036
Again, it doesn't bother us.

479
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:52,688
[chuckling nervously]

480
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,948
Marge, you want to step in here?

481
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:56,467
You mean separate you?

482
00:18:56,544 --> 00:18:58,085
Oh, no. No, not me.

483
00:18:58,196 --> 00:19:00,596
I don't do that anymore.

484
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:07,794
You disgust me!

485
00:19:07,872 --> 00:19:09,147
-Groom yourself!
-You first!

486
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:12,208
You don't yell at
a reunion show, you sick morons!

487
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,819
Look at these losers I cured.

488
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:16,803
Cheapskate-- fixed!

489
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:18,898
Daddy issues-- fixed!

490
00:19:18,974 --> 00:19:19,991
Impotent--

491
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:21,717
came to terms with.

492
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:23,219
[Kirk sighs]

493
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:24,645
You fixed nothing!

494
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:28,148
You plaster over real problems
with an easy catchphrase.

495
00:19:28,226 --> 00:19:31,243
These three have hated each
other since the moment they met,

496
00:19:31,245 --> 00:19:32,912
and all you did
was give them a reason

497
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:34,955
to not feel guilty about it.

498
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:37,566
Don't talk to me about guilt.

499
00:19:37,568 --> 00:19:39,010
I invented guilt!

500
00:19:39,086 --> 00:19:41,662
No! It's my turn to yell!

501
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:43,739
And point and point and point!

502
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:46,333
You can't solve relationships
in 30 minutes.

503
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:49,520
It requires years
of constant hard work

504
00:19:49,597 --> 00:19:53,024
and deep self-reflection
from all parties!

505
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,419
I didn't sign up
for self-reflection.

506
00:19:56,421 --> 00:19:58,771
Now you want me
to work at my marriage?

507
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,013
Oh, I'm leaving you.

508
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:01,941
And I'm taking the pugs!

509
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:04,685
[overlapping arguing]

510
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,262
I'm Marge Simpson,

511
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,040
and the problem is not me.

512
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:10,357
I see it now.

513
00:20:10,435 --> 00:20:12,117
The problem's not me either.

514
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,046
I was wrong to try
to form human connections

515
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:17,048
with the people
that work for me!

516
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:19,458
Well, I don't think
that's the lesson.

517
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,703
Why should I spend time
with anyone below the line?!

518
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,871
The line is there for a reason.

519
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,799
The line is an absolute good!

520
00:20:26,951 --> 00:20:29,209
The line is life!

521
00:20:29,287 --> 00:20:31,395
I always knew
that guy was a phony.

522
00:20:31,472 --> 00:20:34,899
Hey, let's go rub our butts
on his sushi.

523
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,234
Don't you leave me!

524
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,962
I've got an hour to fill
with you mental cases!

525
00:20:39,964 --> 00:20:42,365
[growls]

526
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:47,078
You need my yelling!

527
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:53,008
I'm so sorry
for your loss, Krusty.

528
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,402
Who said you could talk to me?

529
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,255
Oh! Here we go.
