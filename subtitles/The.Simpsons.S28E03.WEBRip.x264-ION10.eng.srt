And the Springfield Atoms
are your hometown team--

125
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,772
since 2003, when we stole them

126
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,810
in the middle of the night
from Portland.

127
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,064

This is Atoms country, bro!

132
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,240

Boston is the Bart Simpson of cities.

139
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,926
(sighs) It all goes back
to the Boston Tea Party,

140
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,473

00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:34,172
And the people from Boston

149
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,170

00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,513
bands, comedians, chowder,

151
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,429
their so-called cream pies,
which are actually cakes.

152
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,088
-And there's...
-Why don't you let me

153
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,597
take your mind off your problems?

154
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,309
And what's with Aerosmith?

155
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,099
That's not how you spell "arrow."

156
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,353

(Homer screams)

163
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,372
Bart, you're my son.

164
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,332
There's no neck tattoo so crass,

165
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,752
no gender reassignment too ambiguous

166
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,331
that I would not love you.

167
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,286
Which is why I must show you
the error of your ways,

168
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:22,548
even if it means dragging
this family all the way to hell.

169

00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,258
{\an8}a hate-cation!

172
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,308

the worst a place has to offer,

173
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,443
and then say, "Told ya!"

174
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,070
Hate-watching, hate-voting
and now a hate-cation?

175
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,858
Why can't everyone just enjoy
things they like?

176
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,903
Because things you like don't fill you

177
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,606
with delicious, delicious rage.

178
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,027
Hmm, I'm gonna love this trip.

179
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,026
I'm gonna love it right in your face.

180
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,658
That's it, build it up in your head.

181
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,705
High hopes just make
the hate-cation stronger.

182
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,670
You're crazy.

183
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,709
Boston can't be that bad.

184
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,505
(horns honking)

185
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,679
I've never loved hating anything so much!

186
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,889
(Boston accent)
Move your garbage car!

187
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,720
I got to get to the packy
before the Bs drop puck!

188
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,060
Told ya!

189
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:25,026
See, boy? Notice how Bostonians
aren't exactly ugly,

190
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,411
but they're not sexy either.

191
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,988
Homer, your negative attitude
is ruining this hate-cation.

192
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,735
So, what to hate first?

193
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,787
The Freedom Trail?

194
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,960
The touch tank
at the New England Aquarium?

195
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,288
Ooh, that could blow.

196
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,833
I want to go to Southie.

197
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,336
That part of town has
the towniest townies of any town.

198
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,590
(scoffs) You think your
Bostonians are so great?

199
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,092
Watch as your beloved hooligans

200
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,545
tear your innocent father limb from limb

201
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,345
with just the slightest provocation.

202
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:57,136
Listen up, you clam-gargling tea-tossers!

203
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:00,346
Fenway is a terrible ballpark!

204
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,648
Dad, don't!

205
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,691
Out of my way, ladies.
You're blocking my shot.

206
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,824
The seats at Fenway Park are too narrow,

207
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,743
and many of them face center field!

208
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:14,292
It's not charming, it's a teardown!

209
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,368
(Boston accent)
The bobbleheads!

210
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,623
They're tippin'!

211
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,294
(Boston accent)
Kid, mind the cart!

212
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,922
-The what?
-The cart!

213
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,629
The cot?

214
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:22,839
Cot!

215
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,709
(grunting)

216
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:27,917
No, don't struggle!

217
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,877
It only makes them bobble harder.

218
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,927
They keep coming.
Bobblehead Steven Wright,

219
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,601
bobblehead Aimee Mann,
bobblehead Bell Biv DeVoe!

220
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,601
The vibrations are killing him!

221
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,943
Don't worry, sweetheart,

222
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,308
I'm a doctor.

223
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,234
I'm also a doctor, kid.

224
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,403
(groaning)

225
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,652
Mm, so many doctors.

226
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,204
He's got a Pedro lodged in his airway.

227
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,448
(Homer gasps)

228
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,950
He'll be fine, ma'am.

229
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,871
And because of our state's
super-socialized health care,

230
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,001
no matter how much your husband
abuses his body,

231
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,079
someone else will pay for it.

232
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,504
What a relief for women
with hot-tempered,

233
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,503
accident-prone husbands.

234
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,495
Oh, yeah,
we got a whole surgical center

235
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,587
for injuries from falling off
icy roofs and gutters.

236
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,264
BOTH: Ooh.

237
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:17,064
While the doctors pull tiny
Bruins helmets out of your skin,

238
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,979
Lisa and I are going to explore
The Hub on our own.

239
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,229
Remember, this is a hate-cation.

240
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,851
You better go someplace bad.

241
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,358
Isn't Mayor Quimby
from somewhere around here?

242
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,070
(all muttering with thick accents)

243
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,659
People are so fit here.

244
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,831
Everyone looks like they're
in a financial services ad.

245
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,331
Free sunscreen? So progressive.

246
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,375
Do you vaccinate your children?

247
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,498
Of course.

248
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,415
But not <i>stupid </i>progressive.

249
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,344
-(low buzzing)
-What's that buzzing noise?

250
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,304
(gasps) It's-- It's nerds!

251
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:58,255
They've got every
recognized species of nerd!

252
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,557
A jester-hatted ferret preener!

253
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,480
A Wild West-afarian!

254
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,229
A <i>Magic: The Gathering </i>gathering!

255
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,521
Oculus rifters!

256
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,114
Yo-yo guys. Yo-yo girls!

257
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,189
A chain mail ping pong player.

258
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,395
(giggles, squeals)

259
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,364
So much education.

260
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,355
If they did a <i>Real Housewives</i> here,

261
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,447
it would be a total snooze.

262
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,532
Ah, it's like heaven for people

263
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,698
who don't believe in heaven.

264
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,036
HOMER:
What the crap is this BS?

265
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,752
What? I thought you'd want
to try candlepin bowling.

266
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,553
Hey, McCarthy, nice half-Worcester.

267
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,380
Get bent, McDonald.

268
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,465
A lot of wood to work with out there.

269
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,970
(sputters) Boston.

270
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,222
They even found a way to mess up bowling.

271
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,394
Just try it.

272
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,562
(groans)

273
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,310
Eh, all right.

274
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,725
(grunts)

275
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,726
None of the usual pain in my knees, back,

276
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,225
wrist, shoulder, neck, and chest.

277
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,324
(grunts)

278
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,157
(groans) One pin standing.

279
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,492
Story of my life.

280
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,077
Whoa there, pal.

281
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,162
Don't forget your third ball.

282
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,327
Hold on, wait.

283
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,955
Wait. Hold on.

284
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,042
Wait.

285
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,251
What?

286
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,337
This is candlepin bowling.

287
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,592
You get three.

288
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,844
Hmm? Hmm.

289
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,426
(grunts)

290
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,943
(gasps) Three balls.

291
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,768
I see it all so clearly now.

292
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,614
What, Dad? What is it?

293
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,440
This regional bowling
with its one extra roll

294
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,276
has knocked my misguided hate
into the gutter.

295
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,283
Mwah!

296
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,874
I like Boston!

297
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,620
Dad, you and me are real
father-son Southies, now.

298
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,623
Just like Ben and Casey Affleck.

299
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,455

this town has to offer.

317
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,075
I never dared dream
about living somewhere

318
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,254
that values education,
with great health care,

319
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,173
and everyone's outdoorsy
but still pallid.

320

If it weren't crazy,

00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,844
I'd say we should be

But no. No, no. That's crazy!

323
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,682
Is it?

324
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,761
(gasps) But I never thought you,
of all people...

325
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:48,227
Honey, this could be the chance
we never thought we'd get.

326
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,939
The chance to knock down
all of life's pins.

327
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,691
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

328
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:59,454
I am.

00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,578
of never not being around
batches of candy.

354
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,084
And unlike the nuclear plant,

355
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:38,455
if I screw up, no one gets hurt.

356
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,674
(screaming)

357
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,469
Are you sure
we have to go to school here?

358
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,429
I sort of thought I'd go
straight to running numbers

359
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,639
for the Irish mob.

360
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,849
Our school is in the heart
of what they once called

361
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:49,969
The Combat Zone.

362
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,805
The Combat Zone! Yes!

363
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,181
Combat rules!

364
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,687
BART: Charter what?

365
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,768
Here's my classroom.

366
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,362
The teacher
is Doris Kearns Goodwin.

367
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:04,491
Today, we explore Lincoln's 1861
suspension of habeas corpus,

368
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,450
using dried macaroni
and pipe cleaners.

369
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,871
(gasps excitedly)

370
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,041
Huh, now to get sent to detention.

371
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,199
That's where I'll meet
my future bank-robbing crew.

372
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,786
(all gasping)

373
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,918
Ha! How do you like them marbles?

374
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,335
Bart, we have a place for kids like you.

375
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,684
Bring it on.

376
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,892
(choir humming
"I'm Shipping Up to Boston")

377
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,891
BART: Kids singing?

378
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,983
(humming continues)

379
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,231
What the hell?

380
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,573
Like you, these kids are gifted
with exceptional energy.

381
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,240
Which they've channeled into a cappella.

382
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,069
<i>♪ I'm shipping up to Boston ♪</i>

383
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,164
<i>♪ Whoa! ♪</i>

384
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,408
(softly)
<i>Departed.</i>

385
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,820
These are the bad kids?

386
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,908
There's not a Wahlberg in the bunch.

387
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,083
I've never felt more like I fit in.

388
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,542
People think Boston's
all Southies and hooligans.

389
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,173
But it's really teachers, Ph.D. students,

390
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,250
doctors, innovators, philanthropists.

391
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,506
It's like living in a giant classroom.

392
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,418
And every day is a new test.

393
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,427
(groaning)

394
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,009
(thunder claps)

395
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,603
Theater?

396
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,772
Colleges?

397
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,770
Culture?

398
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,605
Oh, Pauly,

399
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,520
if you could have known that

400
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,357
Boston was gonna turn out so wussy,

401
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,612
you never would have warned anybody.

402
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,242
Listen, my brother, and you shall see,

403
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,623
this is a town not for you, but for me.

404
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,202
(screaming)

405
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,121
Hey, but what about Grampa?

406
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,206
He lives a thousand miles away.

407
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,251
Great point.

408
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,544
Nobody tell him where we went.

409
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,167
Bart, you haven't touched your clambake.

410
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,375
What's wrong?

411
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,384
This place is all P.C. brainiacs
and Subaru owners

412
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,047
wearing fleece vests.

413
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,886
It's nothing at all
like <i>The Departed.</i>

414
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,311
Oh, honey, I know it's a big change.

415
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:00,060
But someday you'll understand
that providing our family

416
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,404
with a better life...

417
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,558
Something I've never been able to do.

418
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,437
...is the most important thing
in the world.

419
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,775
We've been given a third ball.

420
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,991
Let's not throw it away.

421
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,241
(groans)

422
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,583
Same to you.

423
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,828
No one likes feeling out of place.

424
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,950
That's how I felt back in Springfield.

425
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,248
{\an8}But I sucked it up for eight years.

426
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,331
{\an8}Now it's your turn.

427
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,926
(grunts)

428
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:33,930
(gasps)

429
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,179
Yes! Finally.

430
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:39,023
A Southie crew pulling a job.

431
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,099
I finally took that
spin class with Miranda.

432
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,095
I was sweatin' so friggin' hard.

433
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,107
Hey, try this pressed juice, kid.

434
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,779
Ginger, cayenne...
wicked cleanse, pal.

435
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,358
Come on. Donny, Tommy,

436
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,323
these solar laptops for Rwandans

437
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,703
ain't gonna donate themselves.

438
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,655
It's time for me to ship out of Boston.

439
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,538
What a gorgeous day.

440
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,331
I hope it never ends.

441
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,584
So don't I.

442
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,796
You know, guys, I've picked out
the perfect Boston activity

443
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,418
to help celebrate our move.

444
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,335
-(marching band playing)
-Ooh, a parade.

445
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,093
Not just any parade.

446
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,006
HOMER:
The Boston Americans?

447
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,676
CROWD (chanting):
Bonk! Bonk! Bonk!

448
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,483
{\an8}It's a state holiday because the league
overturned the coach's suspension

449
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,731
{\an8}for using magnets
to affect the coin toss.

450
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,824
{\an8}Pretty cool way to celebrate
our new hometown.

451
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,229
{\an8}Right, Dad?

452
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:35,107
{\an8}(forced) As a Bostonian,
I definitely support my team.

453
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,615
{\an8}Hey, Bonk! Can we get a picture?

454
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,831
Hell to the derrr, little bro!

455
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,252
(grunting)

456
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,211
Come on, Homer, put on the hat.

457
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,001
I can support my hometown team
without putting on a hat.

458
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,876
Hats go on your head!

459
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,724
If you're gonna live in Boston,
you got to wear the hat.

460
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,256
(winces)

461
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,434
Okay.

462
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,722
(grunting, blowing)

463
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,555
You did this on purpose.

464
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,604
My future is at stake.

465
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,768
So don't is mine.

466
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,107
(struggling)
It's... just... a... hat.

467
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,283
You can do it, Homie.

468
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,861
Think of the candlepins.

469
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,366
This is our extra ball!

470
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:21,868
A... better... life.

471
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,202
(yells)

472
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,287
(all gasping)

473
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,246
(quacking)

474
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,674
Derrr?!

475
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,628
Stupid cheaters!

476
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,013
You cheat,

477
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,089
you flip out
when people say you cheat,

478
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,215
and everybody knows

479
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,931
you're nothing but a big bunch
of cheaters!

480
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,722
{\an8}(Moe chuckling)

481
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,466
You made us leave that lovely city

482
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,808
rather than just put on a stupid hat.

483
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,314
It wasn't even fitted.

484
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,975
(sighs)
I just couldn't wear the hat.

485
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,864
Well, I'm still mad at you.

486
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,571
I never even got to experience
one of those Boston winters

487
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,152
everyone raves about.

488
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,817
Come on, baby,
we could never escape our problems

489
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,407
by moving somewhere else.

490
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,621
Our problems are <i>who</i> we are,
not where we are.

491
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,583
Well... maybe.

492
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,793
The traffic was pretty annoying.

493
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,174
Not to mention the unspoken racism.

494
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,841
It wasn't that unspoken.

495
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,512
At least someone in this family

496
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,430
is happy about where they came from.

497
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,643
Oh, don't worry, Lisa.

498
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,810
You'll get back to Boston someday.

499
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,519
What are you talking about?

500
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,929
I never left.

501
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,227
I'm in Boston now.

502
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,614
Welcome home, Lisa.

503
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,359
Class is about to start.

504
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,441
(classical music playing)

505
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,822
Eh.
