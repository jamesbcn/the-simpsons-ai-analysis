00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,273
(bleep)

178
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:28,317
(continues yelling in Hebrew)

179
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:31,695
(bleep)

180
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,450
Okay, that's it.

181
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,036
Because of him,
no Armenian quarter.

182
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,212
Forget it. It's gone.

183
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,210
All thanks to
Mr. Listen-for-Free.

184
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,213
Lord, please help Homer

185
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:46,625
experience the redemptive power
of this sacred land.

186
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,126
(gasps) He's going
for the record.

187
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,427
He's going
for the record!

188
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,177
(groans)

189
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,523
Flanders, you're not supposed
to help him.

190
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,729
Yeah, thanks a lot, Flanders.

191
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,189
(sighs)

192
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,189
Homer, do you think
you could show

193
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,691
just the slightest bit
of reverence?

194
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,863
Ned, I'm an
American tourist.

195
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:08,032
I'm just here to see some
sights, try goofy new food

196
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:11,912
and spread some shekels with my
Carolina Panthers credit card.

197
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,411
Panthers!

198
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,333
(sighs) Homer, could you at
least turn the camera off?

199
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:19,582
If you say it
like Dracula, I will.

200
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,665
-Homer...
-Please, please, please...

201
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,041
Bleh!

202
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,087
(laughing)

203
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,960
That is going right
on StupidFlanders.org.

204
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,718
You know, Homer,
you might really benefit

205
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,510
from opening your heart to
the spirituality of this place.

206
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,056
Please, neighbor?

207
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,929
This really means
a lot to you, huh?

208
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,516
Yes, but it
means more to you.

209
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,852
Boy, are you lousy
at reading minds.

210
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,148
Okay, okay.

211
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,771
For you, I'll try.

212
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,900
<i>FLANDERS:</i>
<i>Lord, I think I may</i>
<i>have finally reached him.</i>

213
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,454
<i>FLANDERS (on recording):</i>
<i>Bleh! Bleh! Bleh!</i>

214
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,914
Homer, quit
playing that back.

215
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,453
I'm not. It's
my ring tone.

216
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,078
Yello.
This is he.

217
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,374
Yeah, I wanted to know:

218
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,957
do you deliver falafels
to the top of Mount Zion?

219
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,093
Great. I'd like
a large falafel

220
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,340
with pepperoni, sausage,
and extra cheese.

221
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,722
Yes, I know
what a falafel is.

222
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
(sighs)

223
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,724
This, eh... Everybody,
look at my face.

224
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,018
This is the Western, or
as you say, Wailing Wall.

225
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,863
It is believed that the Lord
will grant the prayers

226
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,269
that are stuck into the cracks.

227
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,647
Please, no graffiti,
no making the pishen. Yallah.

228
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,815
"Dear Lord: please fix the
following parking tickets:

229
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,525
A647253,

230
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:39,196
SP90325,

231
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,617
Shelbyville 932871..."

232
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,380
Sad.

233
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,381
Never gonna happen.

234
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,973
Sad.

235
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,718
Maybe, if you were Brad Pitt.

236
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,300
Hey, boy, we're supposed
to be acting religiousy.

237
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,005
What are you up to?

238
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,715
Reading prayers and
ignoring them, just like God.

239
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,676
Hey, this one's from you.

240
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,436
"Dear Lord,
don't let Marge find out

241
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,728
the hotel leaves chocolates
on the pillows at night."

242
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,193
Why, you little...

243
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,693
(choking)

244
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,565
"Give my dad
another heart attack?"

245
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,992
(shouts)

246
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,544
Smite him like
the firstborn of Egypt.

247
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,172
Dead baby, dead baby, Passover,
dead baby, dead baby...

248
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,920
(chicken clucks)

249
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,940
(man crying prayer call)

250
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,816
Hey, why am I
running from a girl?

251
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,243
Call me when you're old enough
for your bat mitzvah.

252
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,032
I'll bring you an envelope
full of nothin'.

253
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,025
(grunts)

254
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,077
Karate!

255
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,950
Krav maga!

256
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,076
Krav ma-wha?

257
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,582
Israeli karate.

258
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,254
Less hyah,

259
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,462
more hyah

260
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,171
ha-mee-ha-gee!

261
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,091
(grunts)

262
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,670
(grunting)

263
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,295
You don't fight like a girl.

264
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,722
Or even a Milhouse.

265
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,300
I don't know what <i>is</i>
"Milhouse."

266
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,585
(grunting)

267
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,598
I work security
for the tour.

268
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,560
Dealing with American
punks like you

269
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,020
counts as my
military service.

270
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,140
And we know
<i>all </i>about you.

271
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,058
BART:  <i>Ay, caramba.</i>

272
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,106
Hey, is that
the Ark of the Covenant?

273
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,111
(grunting)

274
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,942
Karate!

275
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,607
Once again, Krav maga!

276
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,697
(grunting)

277
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,242
Quit going for my groin!

278
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,035
No groin, no Krav maga.

279
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,369
(grunting in pain)

280
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,083
Hello, groin.

281
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,956
(speaks Hebrew)
Come on, come on!

282
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,342
Everybody finish lemon ice--
not allowed inside.

283
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,716
Before us stands the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre,

284
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,679
believed to be the home
of the tomb of your Lord.

285
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,220
Or as he's known here,
"the man in the underpants."

286
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,564
Beautiful <i>tachtoonim.</i>

287
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,809
Oh, and what abs!

288
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,480
He was a real good-looking one.

289
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,979
Nice hair. Conditioner?
I think so.

290
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,901
And, Lord, thank you
for letting me see

291
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,570
this wonderful place
where the end of the world

292
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,359
will soon begin.

293
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,783
And thank you again for
the challenge of Homer Simpson.

294
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,702
We've all got
our crosses to bear.

295
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,370
Me Homer, you... the cross.

296
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,700
And now, let me gaze
with reverence

297
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,245
upon the holy
resting place that...

298
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,578
-(snoring)
-(yells)

299
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,123
(mutters):
Uh, wha...?

300
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,916
Homer, this is the
most sacred spot

301
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,501
in Christendom, not
your backyard hammock!

302
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,957
I'm sorry.

303
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,666
It's just that these tours
are so exhausting.

304
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,588
You're jet-lagged.
You're walking around all day.

305
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,097
It's so hard to sleep
knowing Marge and the kids

306
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,390
are all stuck
in one small room, and...

307
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,144
it's so nice and cool

308
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,935
-in the Tomb
of the Unknown Savior.
-Unknown?

309
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,690
This is the tomb of the most
famous man who ever lived!

310
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,823
Porky Pig?

311
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,189
Porky Pig's not a man!

312
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,485
He's a pig, and he's
not even a real pig!

313
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,410
But he <i>is</i>
buried here, right?

314
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,620
That's it!
I'm losing it!

315
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,870
I'm losing it!
You come all the way

316
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,502
to Jerusalem, the happiest
place on earth,

317
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,999
and all the photos
in your camera are
of funny soda pops?

318
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,212
(groans)

319
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,132
Oh, will you...

320
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,340
You are such a...

321
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,629
Ah!

322
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,172
(chuckles):
Chickpea Fizz!

323
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,336
Delete. Delete. Delete.

324
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,885
Whatever.
It's <i>your </i>camera.

325
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,258
(screams)

326
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,175
(grunts)

327
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,262
(grunting,
thumping)

328
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,388
(grunts)

329
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,103
Please, you've got
to let me back in.

330
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,437
I sold 6,000 rolls
of wrapping paper to get here.

331
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,573
That's <i>your </i>problem.

332
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,029
You, my friend, are banned

333
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,648
from ever entering
this church again.

334
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:40,565
(slams door)

335
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,823
B-Banned for life?

336
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,365
Homer, do you know
why I'm a Christian?

337
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,779
Your parents made you?

338
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,157
It's because I
believe every soul

339
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,365
has the possibility
of salvation.

340
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,955
At least I thought so
till now.

341
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,921
Homer Simpson,
you are not worth saving.

342
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,803
What? But I thought
we'd be neighbors in Heaven.

343
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,551
-Goofing on all
the new dead people.
-Not...

344
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,014
worth... saving!

345
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,095
HOMER:
Ned! Ned, wait up!

346
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,347
Ned!
(gasps)

347
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,942
Ned's run off into the desert!

348
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:17,942
Aha!

349
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:21,573
A sand horse--
car of the desert!

350
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,747
(camel grunting)

351
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,461
Mmm!

352
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,553
Nothing like a tall glass
of lukewarm water

00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,087
I'll just wait it out

356
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,681
Orthobot Prime,

357
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,225
the battle begins!

358
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,400
Not so fast--
we can't transform
on the Sabbath!

359
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:01,229
Let us power down
and contemplate the Torah.

379
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,626

You have been chosen, Homer.

387
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,329
Chosen for what,
O mighty gherkin?

388
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,292
Rise and listen, my child.

389
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,463
Yours is

Oh, Homie,
you're alive!

394
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,812
I am more than alive, woman.

395
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,019
I am the Chosen One

396
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,850
who shall unite all the faiths
of the Holy Land!

397
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:04,146
I am... the Messiah!

398
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,231
But you still have
our passports, right?

399
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,031
Oh, yeah.

400
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,990
Gotta keep track of those.

401
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,030
(shouts):
The Messiah...

402
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,244
(normal voice):
has the passports.

403
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,617
-Dad, are you okay?
-I am more than okay!

404
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,457
I am the Messiah,
come to save the world!

405
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,253
Look upon me and shudder!

406
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,456
I already do that.

407
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,586
Uh... Messiah?

408
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,553
-Do you mind if I have
a word with your wife?
-As you wish.

409
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,514
But look not
upon her with lust,

410
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,425
and do not send her
friendly e-mails.

411
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,023
That's how it begins.

412
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,098
(nervous chuckle)

413
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,851
Homer is suffering
from what's called

414
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,226
"Jerusalem syndrome."

415
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,483
Ah, yes, Jerusalem syndrome:

416
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,775
the name given to religious
delusions or psychoses

417
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,860
that occur when
people visit Jerusalem.

418
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,945
Have you ever noticed that
Dad always gets the disease

419
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,081
they write about in the
in-flight magazine?

420
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,198
MARGE:
Oh, my God!

421
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,544
Homer's gone!

422
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,163
(groans)

423
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,656
What's he gonna do now?

424
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:06,708
Hmm, Dad said he was going
to unite all faiths.

425
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:10,554
And only one site is sacred
to Muslims, Christians and Jews:

426
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,721
The Dome of the Rock!

427
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,089
Dome of the Rock?

428
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,215
Messiah away...!

429
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,852
(grunts)

430
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,309
(gasps):
This one says
"Carolina Panthers"!

431
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,560
Messiah says "Rowrr!"

432
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,154
{\an8}JACOB:
(speaks Hebrew)
Okay, everybody, come on.

433
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,020
This shrine contains the rock

434
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,817
on which Abraham was going
to sacrifice his son.

435
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,201
And Muslims believe
something, too.

436
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,198
To find out, hire
a Muslim tour guide.

437
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,700
<i>That's </i>a barrel
of laughs.

438
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,492
-Anyway, shut your face.
-Thanks, thanks.

439
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,325
You can stop
giving the tour now.

440
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,250

You can hold my gun.

441
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,250
-I used it in Entebbe.
I killed three Ugandans.
-No, thanks.

442
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,384
Before you go in,

443
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,630
you fill out

444
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,001
(groans):
Okay.

445
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,510
Uh, eh, don't

446
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,182

447
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,101
What, Israeli
people are pushy?

448
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,559
How about you experience
a couple of genocides

449
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,310
and see how laid-back
<i>you </i>are?

450
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,232
We were purged from Spain!
Throw out of there!

451
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,981

452
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,613
But for us, Jews,
no flamenco, get out!

453
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,731
I'm pushy? Please.

454
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,988
You stay there,

455
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,609
surrounded by your
great enemy, Canada!

456
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,907
Try Syria for two months,
then we'll see who's pushy!

457
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,540
Attention, Christians,
Muslims, <i>and </i>Jews:

458
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,332
I have come to gather you
into a new faith.

459
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,287
From now on,
you shall be called...

460
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,167
Chris-mu-jews.

461
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,344
-(unenthusiastic murmuring)
-MAN: I-I don't know.

462
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:38,223
Because when you get down to it,
aren't all religions the same?

463
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,262
They tell you
what to eat,

464
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,555
when to pray,

465
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,058
how this imperfect clay
that we call man

466
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,941
can mold itself
to resemble the divine.

467
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,229
But we can never attain
that ultimate grace

468
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,023
while there is hatred in
our hearts for each other.

469
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,277
(quietly):
I did it.

470
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,228
I reached him.

471
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,198
Celebrate your commonality.

472
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,358
Some of us don't eat pork.

473
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,317
Some of us don't eat shellfish.

474
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,987
But all of us love chicken.

-MAN: He's right!

476
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,503
