we’ve had to sell

Eh, maybe I should run this
by my husband first.

115

161

The Shadow Knight.

178
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,790
Where he rides, death
is sure to follow.

179

00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,964
He’s the most evil,
destructive player in this game.

181
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,045
He once beat me to death
with my own life bar.

182
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,643
Mmm... mmm.

183
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:12,389
(booming voice): Who dares
battle with the Shadow Knight?

184
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,523
(sinister laugh)

185
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,020
(groaning)

186
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,022
Oh...

187
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,068
He was a good man.

188
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,446
A good, moist man.

189
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,608
Eww.

190
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,986
I can’t watch this.

191
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,248
BART: Another senseless
killing by...

192
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,579
the Shadow Knight!

193
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,714
Hmm?

194
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,630
(sinister laugh)

195
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,000
(gasps)

196
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,546
My son is
an evil knight!

197
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,380
The most successful evil knight
in all the Earthland Realms!

198
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,008
Not bad.

199
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,601
(booming voice):
Ay caramba, what a day!

200
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,765
Brave sir knight?

201
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,114
(normal voice): What
is it, Lady Milhouse?

202
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,319
I’m not a lady,

203
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,648
it’s a spell.

204
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,533
A spell you said
you’d reverse.

205
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,030
Yeah, yeah,
it’s on my list.

206
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,781
Anyway, someone’s here
to see you.

207
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:09,783
Hi, Bart!

208
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,124
It’s your mom!

209
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,869
I’m in your videogame
with you!

210
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,910
What?

211
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,333
(groans)

212
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,791
Why Milhouse,

213
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,331
don’t you look pretty!

214
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,674
It’s a spell!

215
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,789
And thank you.

216
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,706
Mom, what are you
doing in my game?!

217
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,205
How would you like it

218
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,627
if I suddenly started
going shopping with you?

219
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,175
I’d like that
very much.

220
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,968
(grunting)

221
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,102
Uh, wh-what can I get ya,
Mr. Shadow Knight, sir?

222
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,430
A grog? Grog light?

223
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,805
Uh, diet grog
with lemon?

224
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,731
Just wring the blood
from this pixie head.

225
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,770
Yes, sir.

226
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,773
Hi, everybody!

227
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,265
How do you play this game?

228
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,647
(moaning)

229
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,493
Ow!

230
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,438
(groaning)

231
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,240
Now flog yourself
with this mace

232
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,953
while reciting
the Goblin’s Code!

233
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,124
Goblin’s Code,
yes, sir!

234
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,122
All goblins must be free
of visible worms.

235
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,214
Oooh!

236
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,498
In the presence
of a lady,

237
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,121
a goblin must remove
his hat and ears.

238
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,208
(grunts)

239
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,752
(laughing)

240
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,207
Bart, are you
drinking?

241
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,382
Mom!

242
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,677
(laughing)

243
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,840
You’re making me
look bad

244
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,048
in front
of my minions!

245
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,217
If they think less of you
because of me,

246
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,426
then they’re not really
your minions.

247
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,346
(grunts)

248
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,194
I’m going off to explore
the Crevices of Lagrimmar.

249
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,270
Great, I’ll come
with you.

250
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,435
Shouldn’t you bundle up?

251
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,073
Here, let me enchant
your pants.

252
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,229
(grunts)

253
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,987
Hey, Lisa,

254
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,819
self-conscious
about your shins?

255
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,244
In my day, girls were worried
about their boobs.

256
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,123
Dad, I’m going
to play soccer.

257
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,084
I fell in love
with the game

258
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,662
when I saw
<i>Bend It Like Beckham.</i>

259
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,667
(Indian music plays)

260
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,589
Father, I am proud
of my cultural heritage,

261
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,248
but I also love soccer!

262
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,586
(cheering)

263
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,671
You tell him,
Jesminder!

264
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,676
I forbid you to bend
it like Beckham.

265
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,138
Plus, you must marry
this complete stranger.

266
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,139
His father is an important
business acquaintance of mine.

267
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,561
Love counts
for nothing!

268
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,429
You tell her,
Mr. Dhanabhai!

269
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,516
Business contacts are more
important than love!

270
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,192
(girls grunting)

271
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,150
Wait, that’s soccer?

272
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,940
I always called it
"human foosball."

273
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,984
Would you like me
to take you to your game?

274
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,527
You already promised
you would.

275
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,201
Aw, do I have to?

276
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,659
(girls grunting)

277
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,119
{\an8}Uh-huh.

278
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,528
{\an8}Okay, Morty,
I’ll tell them.

279
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,577
Sorry, ladies.

280
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,039
We got no referee,

281
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,499
so the game’s
been canceled.

282
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,999
(laughing)

283
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,120
I’m sorry.

284
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,876
I’m sure you’re
very disappointed.

285
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,588
(laughing)

286
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,708
What happened
to the ref?

287
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,054
He quit!

288
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,419
Being a ref is
a thankless job...

289
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,915
the parents hate ya...

290
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,547
the only upside is the kids
share their snack with you.

291
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,085
HOMER: Did someone
say "snack"?

292
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,718
I’ll be your ref!

293
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,726
(girls cheering)

294
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,388
Dad, where’d you get
that outfit?

295
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,347
I got fired from
Foot Locker.

296
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,187
<i>♪ Kicks just keep getting harder</i>
<i>to find... ♪</i>

297
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,113
What’s the
matter, buddy?

298
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,192
The American flag not
good enough for ya?

299
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,197
(grunts)

300
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,738
That was my father.

301
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,071
I’m your father now.

302
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,776
I’m open! I’m open!

303
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,076

306
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,669
So... tired.

307
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,715
(vomiting)

308
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,470
Could someone bring me
another barf cone?

309
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:22,062
So... I thought
it went real well.

310
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,099
Until I swallowed
the whistle.

311
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,603
You don’t even
know the rules!

312
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,305
This could be
my new thing,

313
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,105
and you’re turning
it into a joke!

314
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,478
Hilarious joke?

315
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,984
Sadly, no.

316
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,646
I’m disappointed with the way
you acted today...

317
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,405
but I’m not
surprised.

318
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,658
(sighs)

319
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:39,739
(whistle blowing)

320
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,626
Oh, let’s see.

321
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,960
Should I take the Trail of
Death, or the Path of Doom?

322
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,456
Maybe I should
just go back.

323
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,218
(shrieks)

324
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,839
(gasps)

325
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,636
Is this <i>Wall Street</i>
<i>Journal </i>online?

326
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,471
(screams and groans)

327
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,716
Oof.

328
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,307
Well, well,
looks like

329
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,692
something’s finally about
to happen in this game.

330
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,149
Just in time.

331
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,019
I was about to go
to the Pottery Barn site

332
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,186
to get design ideas.

333
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,487
(metal clanging)
It’s the Shadow Knight!

334
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,650
Run!

335
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,488
I forget how to do that.

336
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,612
Control-shift-R...

337
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,988
(Dolph screaming)

338
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,195
Thank you, Bart.

339
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,326
This frame grab’s going
on my coffee cup.

340
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,174
You guys wanna meet
at the Kwik-E-Mart?

341
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,629
I’m in the tub right now.

342
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,129
I’m in Denmark!

343
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,500
GIRL: Let’s go,
come on!

344
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,707
(girls cheering)

345
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:36,706
Ow.
(whistle blowing)

346
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,087
Hand ball!
Direct kick!

347
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,675
Dad, I’m impressed!

348
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,601
You’ve become
a much better referee.

349
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,059
Thanks, honey.

350
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,389
After what you
said to me,

351
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,814
I watched hours
and hours of soccer.

352
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,483
I almost saw a goal!

353
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,691
But there were so many ads
for Spanish cell phones.

354
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,186
(panting)

355
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,526
Do it, sweetie!

356
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,781
Save our troubled
marriage!

357
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,493
(grunting)

358
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,497
(whistle blowing)

359
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,448
Foul on 23!

360
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,707
That’s crazy.

361
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:10,749
Your daughter
just tripped

362
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,251
on her own
clumsy feet!

363
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,003
Come on, Lisa.
Admit it!

364
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,594
Um, uh...

365
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,759
I’m a spectator addressing
a player-- answer me!

366
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,220
I said foul

367
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,800
on 23!

368
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,057
You are so blind,

369
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,599
even Jesus couldn’t
heal you!

370
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:29,892
Helen, please.

371
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,725
Don’t drop
the J bomb.

372
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,731
Well, I’m throwing you

373
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,102
both out of the game!

374
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,018
(both gasp)

375
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:39,898
(Lisa gasps)

376
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,857
Ow!

377
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,318
She tripped me.

378
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,657
Ow! Oh!

379
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,163
Ow!

380
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,155
(blows whistle)

381
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,156
Foul on the other girl.

382
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,577
Lisa gets
a penalty kick,

383
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,825
and every other kid has
to pay her a dollar.

384
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,627
That is an outrage!

385
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,210
Your daughter’s been
floppin’ all day!

386
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,505
She has not.
Your daughter’s a dirty player.

387
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,969
Sir, I have sired
a dum-dum, a mush-head,

388
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,931
a what’s-it, a dog boy,

389
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,641
and somethin’ with
a human face and fish body,

390
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,432
what we called Kevin,

391
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,056
but my young’uns is
not dirty players.

392
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,063
I don’t need a soccer lecture
from a hillbilly.

393
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,605
That’s hill-William
to you, sir.

394
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,610
How about
a lecture from me,

395
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,862
Ronaldo?

396
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,573
(gasps)
Ronaldo?!

397
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,413
Winner of two
World Cups

398
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,988
and three FIFA Player
of the Year awards?

399
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,874
Yes, I am
what you said.

400
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,911
Now I travel the world
exposing floppers,

401
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,746
and your daughter
is a flopper.

402
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,711
Now, Ronaldo away!

403
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:38,963
You heard
Geraldo.

404
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,804
What’s it
gonna be?

405
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,300
(sighs)

406
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,092
Yellow card!

407
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,255
You can’t give me
a yellow card.

408
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,854
You’re my father.

409
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,389
When I put on these shorts,
I’m not your father anymore,

410
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,233
and judging by how
tight they are,

411
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,849
I’m never going to be
anyone else’s, either.

412
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,055
(grunts)

413
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,685
This is what I think
of your yellow card!

414
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,482
Unsportsmanlike
conduct.

415
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,726
That’s a red card.

416
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,527
You’re out
of the game!

417
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,951
But... But...

418
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,279
Oh!

419
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,333
Another family broken
up by Ronaldo.

420
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,618
Yes!

421
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,581
What a fun quest!

422
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,501
Aren’t you glad I made you
take that nap in the middle?

423
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,081
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

424
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,706
Let me just put this holy
grail in my trophy room.

425
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,173
Whoa!

426
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,553
Where’s all my stuff?!

427
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,380
I thought all the swords

428
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,965
and severed heads were kind
of gory, so I redecorated

429
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,972
using the Hello Kitty
expansion pack.

430
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,014
No!

431
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,096
Mom?

432
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,307
Mom?!

433
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,567
I was killed
by my own son.

434
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,196
How could you kill
your own mother?

435
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,950
It was just a game.

436
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,242
A game I used to enjoy
before you mommed all over it.

437
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,197
Lisa, sweetie,

438
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,036
I was just
following the rules.

439
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:56,871
Great.

440
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,326
The one time you actually
do something right,

441
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,665
you ruin my life.

442
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,461
(sobbing)

443
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,304
I think
I’ll go to bed.

444
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,090
It’s 5:00
in the afternoon.

445
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,973
Who cares? I’m dead.

446
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,390
Jumpin’ Johnnycakes!

447
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,178
Those dames
are cheesed.

448
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,261
Son, I’ll never understand
women if I live to be 40.

449
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,678
Big if.

450
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,976
You said it.

451
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,189
Enjoy me
while I last.

452
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,188
(both laughing)

453
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,690
(chuckles)

454
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,152
Want to go slam
a few beers?

455
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,152
Want to watch me?

456
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,403
You know it.

457
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,320
(glass squeaking)

458
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,025
What’s the matter,
Homer and Bart?

459
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,735
Lisa’s mad at me,
and Marge is mad at him.

460
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,406
Well, I’m just
the bartender here,

461
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,544
but it seems to me,
you could win Lisa back

462
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,331
by appealing to her
sense of reason,

463
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,915
and you can win
your mom back

464
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,330
by appealing
to her feelings.

465
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,628
Gee, Moe,
you give great advice.

466
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,012
Yeah. What have you done
with the real Moe?

467
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,879
(all laugh)

468
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,348
(grunting)

469
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,728
Lisa, honey,
I bought you something.

470
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,689
A DVD!

471
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,939
Not interested.

472
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,771
It’s a documentary

473
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,396

00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:08,152

Oh! But to
get that DVD,

512
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,514
I had to become
a PBS subscriber.

513
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:03,056
Now I’m paying for crap
like <i>American Masters.</i>

514

515
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,903
Dad, I can’t
forgive you,

because there’s
nothing to forgive.

517
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,063
Huh?!

518
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,568
You were right
to kick me out of that game.

519
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,190
Soccer was
making me insane,

520
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,567
just as it did the continents
of Europe and South America.

521
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,485
Those places
are pretty terrible.

522

So from now on,

523
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,080
I’ll play soccer

524
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,330
for the same reason

525
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,501
I study chemistry--
for fun.

526
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,040
Do you want
to play a little?

527
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,543
I sure do.

528
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,536
Wait till I tell
the other moms

529
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,917
you gave
two-thirds

530
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,054
of your life
force to save me.

531
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,671

If you kill me, I’ll egg
your houses in real life!

538
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,976
It’s still
worth it.
