Bart, I finally get why some dudes
become dads on purpose.

184
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,457
This has been the best week of my life.

185
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,961
Me too. And my life's not
a barfnado like yours.

186
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,422
Do you think it's a little strange

187
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:37,594
that your dad is suddenly winning
all these contests and giant prizes?

188
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,847
Yeah, I've noticed the same thing.

189
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:45,518
I guess I just assumed that sports
in America were getting much, much easier.

190
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,603
Hey, honey.

191
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:50,857
Do you want this ladies' gillie suit
I won at the tobacco-spitting competition?

192
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,859
Homer, we need to talk.

193
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,780
Oh, I like when we talk.
I don't like when we need to talk.

194
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:01,284
You're sure winning a lot of activities
you've never even tried before.

195
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:04,789
I'm sorry to ask this,
but are you cheating?

196
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh, I can't lie to you.

197
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,170
Wait, that's a lie. I can lie and I have.

198
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,672
But I'm not going to now.

199
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,800
I am cheating,
but not for prizes or glory.

200
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,260
Me and Bart are cheating together
as a team.

201
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,304
It's our father-son thing.

202
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,015
[sighs] Can't you do
something else with Bart?

203
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,309
Like coach his soccer team?

204
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,729
Soccer? You mean bribing refs?
Where's the challenge?

205
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,024
That's not the kind of cheating
that brings a dad and his son closer.

206
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,944
We have this special bond
like LaVar and Lonzo Ball

207
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,155
or Cecil and Prince Fielder
before they became estranged.

208
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:42,659
No. No, no, no, no, no. Cheating is wrong.

209
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,870
Maybe you should find
another way to bond with your son.

210
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,747
Like just being a good dad.

211
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,417
Oh, where's the Jet Ski in that?

213
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,421
Marge, you're always saying
you want our kids to succeed.

214
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,007
Then maybe not cheating is cheating them.

Lisa Simpson. I'm here
from the University of Springfield Camp,

224
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,901
and I'm very excited to tell you

225
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,530
that you've been accepted
into our summer program.

226
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,282
[gasps] I got in?

227
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,616
That's amazing.

228
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,827
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

229
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:29,956
It's so classy that you came
to tell everybody in person.

230
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,124
As the rowing coach,

231
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,668
I like to personally welcome
all the incoming members

232
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,378
of our camp rowing team.

233
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,963
What? Rowing?

234
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,257
Your application photos were amazing.

235
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,092
You can row anywhere in the shell.

236
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,511
Stroke, bow, powerhouse.

237
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,347
Wh... Uh, what? What?

238
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,309
{\an8}See you at camp. Here's your Henley.

into my application.

And I know who.

243
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:15,210
- [screams]
- You cheated for me!

244
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,504
What? No, I didn't.

245
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,714
Honey, what's the matter?

246
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,383
Dad and Bart put my head on
an Olympic rower's body

247
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,344
to cheat my way into camp.

248
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,722
No, we didn't. Why would we help
someone who's already good at things?

249
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,432
Now shut up. Dad's in the finals.

250
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,478
He could win an electric truck
they converted back to gas.

251
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,565
You've already cheated
at every dumb sport in the world.

252
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:41,361
I bet you're cheating
at this dumb sport right now.

Lisa. [shushes]

256
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,495
A lot of these axe throwers
have guns in their cars.

257
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:54,833
What are you afraid of?
That they'll see this?

258
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,917
[all gasp]

259
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,377
A magnet.

260
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,087
If you was cheating at this,

261
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:04,592
I bet you cheated at all them other events
you surprisingly and illogically won.

262
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,177
We were robbed.

263
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,430
Of our prizes and our dignity.

264
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,349
- [rock music playing in headphones]
- Get 'em!

265
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,062
Stay back.
I'm a champion axe thrower. [grunts]

266
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,398

- [Hans] Ow, my stump.

[axe throwers clamoring]

268
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,405
Don't let them cheaters get away.

269
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,950
Look, guys, you got us all wrong.
We didn't cheat.

270
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,495
Quick. Get on the ATVs we won by cheating.

271
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:38,043
[chuckles] Looks like you just got cheated
out of your revenge.

272
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,349
[all sigh]

273
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,436
If you think I'm not mad anymore,
you're wrong.

274
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,606
While we were escaping,
I got even more mad.

275
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,733
It's called multitasking.

276
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,028
And it was one of the legitimate skills
on my application.

277
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,280
Remember, the one you cheated on?

278
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,782
We didn't, I swear. Cheater's honor.

279
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,075
Oh, really?

280
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:15,496
Well, if you didn't, then who uploaded
all those fake photos of me rowing

281
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,790
so I could get into camp?

282
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,959
[Marge] I did.

283
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,127
You? You?

284
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,504
No, no. It must have been me!

285
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,256
No, it was me.

286
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,467
But, Marge, you're you.

287
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,887
You're sweet, pure, incorruptible.

288
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:35,099
[gasps] Dad, we ruined Mom.

289
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,226
No. No!

290
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,313
[retching, coughing]

291
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,776
What have I done?

292
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,279
Other than everything I know that I did.

293
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,280
Yes, I cheated.

294
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,324
And you showed me how to do it,

295
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,993
but not to win a beef jerky dehydrator

296
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,746
or Harley Davidson beard shampoo.

297
00:15:56,747 --> 00:16:02,001
If you want your kids to succeed,
then not cheating is cheating them.

298
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,087
[retches]

299
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:10,510
Mom, you also cheated me out
of the chance to get in on my own merits.

300
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,554
I worked hard. I cleaned up the beach.

301
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,974
I taught old people how to email.

302
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,936
{\an8}I was working with 72-point font.

303

Oh, this is all our fault.

304
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,775
Son, we made a terrible mistake.

305
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,778
But we can learn and do better.

306
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,698
Let's never, ever bond again.

307
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,283
You're right. Never again.

308
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:37,161
Promise me this is the last time we hug.

00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,080
I swear, Dad. I swear.

00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,540
There you is.

311
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,208
We never would have found you

312
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,962
if it weren't for all that guilt-vomiting
we done heard.

313
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,298
Go ahead. Kill me. Cleave my skull.

314
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:53,720
I don't deserve to live after corrupting
the only good person I've ever known.

315
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,555
I don't know about that.

316
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,182
We were just going to
rough you up a little bit.

317
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,477
Oh, well, I mean, I...
I guess we could kill you,

318
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:04,355
but you probably need
to sign a waiver or something.

319
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,357

You think we'll all stay friends
after this or just drift apart?

Yep. Drift apart it is.

Ah, this is the camp I wanted to go to.

327
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,133
They must know about the fake application.

{\an8}[chuckling] Welcome, Simpsons.
I hope you don't mind

Um, I want to apologize for being party
to a false application.

that this institution has
a proud tradition of embracing cheating.

00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,167
{\an8}Wh... You're okay with me cheating?

338
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,253
{\an8}Say it isn't so, Dean Belichick.

339
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,381
{\an8}You think your application was
the only one with embellishments?

340
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,508
{\an8}Look at these.

341
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,803
{\an8}This 10-year-old claims
she performs open-heart surgery.

342
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:21,891
{\an8}This 12-year-old said it was her idea
to use big, fat straws for boba tea.

343
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:25,561
{\an8}And you know what?
[chuckling] We let them all in.

344
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,814
[Lisa gasps]

345
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,191
But I want to live an ethical life.

346
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,692
This is the world we live in.

347
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:36,197
Taxpayers hide money from the IRS.
Dating profiles are nothing but lies.

348
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,867
And right now, the Houston Astros
are dreaming up ways to cheat

349
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,537
that would blow your mind.

350
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,621
[Homer screams]

351
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,958
So, here at USC,
we decided to own cheating

352
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,794
and prepare our students
for the way the world is.

353
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,130
Not the way some would like it to be.

354
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,714
What do you say, Lisa?

355
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:58,052
{\an8}Will you accept our most prestigious
Lance Armstrong summer scholarship?

356
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,304
{\an8}Am I risking everything I believe in

357
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,349
{\an8}by refusing to do something
I don't believe in?

358
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,642
{\an8}[groans]

359
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,894
{\an8}I choose honesty.

360
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,437
I'm proud of you, honey.

361
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,940
Yep. Walking out the door,

362
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:15,194
leaving this room
and this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

363
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:19,073
[chuckles] Walking out. Here I go.

364
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,744
[strains] Principles powering my feet.
[grunts]

365
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,454
Would you like me
to give you a little push?

366
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,540
Would you?

367
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,041
[sighs]

368
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,711
Let the rowing coach know
we're sorry she was lied to.

369
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,631
[laughs] I think she may be used to it.

370
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,382
Homer, a moment?

371
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:40,469
I've been following your incredible
streak of dishonesty.

372
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,430
[chuckling] Very impressive.

373
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,933
So much so, I'd like to offer you
a position as a professor

374
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,394
in our Faculty of Cheating Studies.

375
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,520
{\an8}What do you say?

376
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:53,400
{\an8}Will you shape the minds
of tomorrow's white-collar criminals?

377
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,235
{\an8}No.

378
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,779
{\an8}For once, I learned something at college.

379
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,072
{\an8}A lesson.

380
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,283
Cheating almost ruined my wife.

381
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:06,204
Who is all the love and goodness
you can stuff inside a green dress.

382
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,497
I'll never cheat again.

383
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:11,251
Except on diets.

384
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,966
Okay. Here's how you really skip a rock.

385
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,219
Oh, I used to be so good at this.

386
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,887
Hey, where's Bart?

387
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:27,142
He said he had an appointment
every Thursday night from 7:00 to 9:00.

388
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,397
Students, look to your left.
Look to your right.

389
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,984
Those are the people
you'll be cheating off of.
