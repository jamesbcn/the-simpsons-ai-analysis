00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:11,873
Who knows? But if I had to guess...

180
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,933
Warm moist air coming
off the ocean meets

181
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,692
cold breezes descending
from the mountains.

182
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,027
Springfield's unique topography,

183
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:19,605
a remnant of glaciation
during the last ice age,

184
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,882
produces varying degrees of albedo,

185
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:23,033
a unique system of high-
and low-pressure zones,

186
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:25,628
which shunt odor-rich air
from kitchens around the town

187
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:27,388
into this natural amphitheater.

188
00:08:27,615 --> 00:08:29,282
But again, that's just a guess.

189
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:32,027
Oh!

190
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:34,136
Every individual smell is distinct

191
00:08:34,189 --> 00:08:37,231
and takes me back to a
specific time and place.

192
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:40,293
Oh, pepperoni pizza.

193
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,462
<i>Braised bok choy.</i>

194
00:08:44,574 --> 00:08:45,798
<i>Ribeye steak.</i>

195
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,318
Oh! This is a miracle.

196
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,247
Food is a miracle!

197
00:08:53,474 --> 00:08:55,399
I think I love food again.

198
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,993
I knew this place would fix you.

199
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,737
Wait, I'm getting a scent

200
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:02,665
I've never encountered.

201
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,999
Homer.

202
00:09:04,094 --> 00:09:06,485
Oh, man, we got to find the source.

203
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,262
And I'll play phone games.

204
00:09:25,006 --> 00:09:26,781
I could swear I've
seen this house before.

205
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:30,267
But blindfolded,
from the trunk of a car...

206
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,602
- Gentlemen.
- _

207
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,769
Hi!

208
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:34,864
What a pleasant surprise...

209
00:09:35,016 --> 00:09:39,018
that you made it past my bodyguards!

210
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,704
Sorry, boss.
I thought I had a pebble in my shoe.

211
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:44,948
Turns out there's this
embroidery on my sock.

212
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:47,922
Let's go, Thad.
The man with the goons is busy.

213
00:09:47,957 --> 00:09:50,212
- Bye!
- What are you cooking in there?

214
00:09:50,365 --> 00:09:52,014
I have to know.

215
00:09:55,036 --> 00:09:57,961
Wow, this stew smells amazing.

216
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,040
This recipe is all I
have left of a great man.

217
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:04,652
Sit and I'll tell you
the whole sad story.

218
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:06,470
Not because it's any of your business,

219
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:08,714
but because this pot needs to simmer

220
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,243
for the length of one whole sad story.

221
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:15,078
_

222
00:10:15,113 --> 00:10:18,499
<i>When I was a child,
there existed an uneasy peace</i>

223
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,893
<i>between Springfield's two
most powerful families.</i>

224
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,820
<i>The Italian, uh, "Thing of Ours,"</i>

225
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,656
<i>and the Prussian mob.</i>

226
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:26,916
<i>To maintain the peace,</i>

227
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,918
<i>each boss would send his youngest son</i>

228
00:10:29,012 --> 00:10:32,680
<i>to live with the other family,
as collateral.</i>

229
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,017
<i>It was a ceremony steeped in tradition.</i>

230
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,835
♪ <i>Flip-flop, clippety-clop</i> ♪

231
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,096
♪ <i>I declare a son swap.</i> ♪

232
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:43,340
<i>My surrogate father's name was</i>

233
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:45,768
<i>Wilhelm Von Wonthelm.</i>

234
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,422
<i>It was rumored that he had
never in his life smiled.</i>

235
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,866
<i>And I believed it.</i>

236
00:10:53,094 --> 00:10:54,777
<i>Wilhelm conducted the mob's business</i>

237
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:57,121
<i>from the kitchen of his restaurant.</i>

238
00:10:58,708 --> 00:10:59,949
<i>He had a deep love for the grim,</i>

239
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:02,192
<i>humorless flavors of German cuisine,</i>

240
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:04,603
<i>a passion that was not shared</i>

241
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,214
<i>by his eldest son and heir,</i>

242
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,368
<i>Maximillian.</i>

243
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:08,716
Where are you going?

244
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:11,293
We need that blood
sausage for the dessert.

245
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:12,553
No can do, Pops.

246
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,204
My band has a gig tonight.

247
00:11:14,224 --> 00:11:16,632
<i>Max had fallen
prey to the scourge</i>

248
00:11:16,784 --> 00:11:19,285
<i>that was destroying America's youth:</i>

249
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,562
<i>the ska revival.</i>

250
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:26,550
You are needed here, my son.

251
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,143
Not out all night tromboning

252
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:32,031
to a calypso-flavored fusion
of jazz and punk rock.

253
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:42,530
You chop like a Belgian.

254
00:11:42,565 --> 00:11:45,327
But with ceaseless repetition
and unyielding criticism,

255
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,046
you will learn.

256
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:49,763
_

257
00:11:50,636 --> 00:11:53,374
You schnitzel well.
You are a sh-natural.

258
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:54,911
<i>And then it happened.</i>

259
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:58,808
<i>The old man smiled at me.</i>

260
00:12:01,969 --> 00:12:04,013
Maximillian,
put down that<i> brassentooter.</i>

261
00:12:04,465 --> 00:12:06,298
Tonight, I need you here with me.

262
00:12:06,317 --> 00:12:08,242
Why don't you ask your
new son to help you?

263
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,077
<i>This was the night</i>

264
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:13,063
<i>Wilhelm was to pass his
greatest secret on to his son.</i>

265
00:12:13,157 --> 00:12:18,068
<i>The recipe for</i> gewalteintopf:
<i>"Stew of Violence."</i>

266
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:20,588
<i>A centuries-old dish served only</i>

267
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:22,590
<i>at the initiation of new members</i>

268
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:24,425
<i>into the Prussian mob.</i>

269
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,410
<i>For his son to reject this sacred honor</i>

270
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:30,747
<i>was a stab to Wilhelm's heart.</i>

271
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:32,734
Ska is no future!

272
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:34,326
How much was your band paid to perform

273
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:37,162
at the grand opening of
the Continental Tire store?

274
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:40,165
- $50.
- But there are 17 of you.

275
00:12:40,258 --> 00:12:43,093
And several who do
nothing but dance around.

276
00:12:43,112 --> 00:12:46,596
This recipe is at the center
of everything we believe.

277
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:49,450
Please, let me pass it on to you.

278
00:12:54,698 --> 00:12:56,439
<i>This man had
survived car bombings, bullets</i>

279
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:59,701
<i>and the shame of adult braces.</i>

280
00:12:59,854 --> 00:13:00,894
<i>But not this.</i>

281
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:05,357
This recipe belongs with someone

282
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,950
who respects tradition.

283
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:09,027
Protect it with your life.

284
00:13:09,046 --> 00:13:11,864
And never share it with my son.

285
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:14,883
Promise me...

286
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:18,646
I never realized how gross
it is under the oven.

287
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:24,059
Maximillian took his father's place

288
00:13:24,211 --> 00:13:26,170
as head of the Prussian mob.

289
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,064
He rules with an iron
fist while still dropping

290
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:33,051
poorly-received ska
albums on SoundCloud.

291
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,162
But I kept my promise to his father

292
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:38,223
and never gave Maximillian the recipe.

293
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:40,501
Now, if you will turn your backs,

294
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,227
I must consult the recipe

295
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:46,173
for the final secret ingredients.

296
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:58,852
You may turn back around.

297
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:06,752
Oh, it's so good
I never want to swallow.

298
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,437
Oh! Me neither.

299
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:10,531
Let's stay like this forever.

300
00:14:10,758 --> 00:14:12,090
Okay.

301
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,285
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

302
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,432
_

303
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,207
Everyone, shut up!

304
00:14:20,284 --> 00:14:23,785
Thad has a new show and the
trailer's about to drop.

305
00:14:23,938 --> 00:14:26,046
I said, "Shut up!"

306
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,507
Shut up!

307
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:30,295
<i>Shh.</i>

308
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:33,462
<i>I'm Thad Parkour, and I'm a thief.</i>

309
00:14:33,614 --> 00:14:37,707
<i>Snitches get dishes on
my new Chew Network show</i>

310
00:14:37,801 --> 00:14:39,059
Kitchen Betrayals.

311
00:14:39,286 --> 00:14:41,954
<i>Watch me steal secret recipes</i>

312
00:14:41,972 --> 00:14:43,138
<i>from unsuspecting chumps</i>

313
00:14:43,232 --> 00:14:45,215
<i>and reveal them to the world.</i>

314
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:48,384
<i>On the series premiere,
I'll show you the murder stew</i>

315
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:52,281
<i>that certified killers don't
want you to know about.</i>

316
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,558
- Stew!
- What's wrong?

317
00:14:55,652 --> 00:14:57,302
Everything's fine.

318
00:14:57,304 --> 00:15:01,306
Take the baby and go to
Flander's panic room.

319
00:15:01,605 --> 00:15:02,641
Damn it, Thad!

320
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:05,085
If Fat Tomy sees this,
his gonna come to my house

321
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:06,236
and he's gonna...

322
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,922
Homie, Homie, open up.

323
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,833
- I've got groceries.
- Phew!

324
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:16,704
Look who dropped by.
A very worked-up Fat Tony.

325
00:15:16,857 --> 00:15:18,248
Hello, Homer.

326
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:21,994
I was just meeting your charming widow.

327
00:15:23,042 --> 00:15:25,128
I'm not that charming.

328
00:15:25,163 --> 00:15:27,995
Thanks to that idiot
putting the recipe on TV,

329
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,943
the Prussians are on
their way to kill me.

330
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,170
But I had a thought:

331
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:33,672
you first.

332
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,008
Please, Fat Tony,
we've been through so much.

333
00:15:36,026 --> 00:15:38,601
You can't kill me over a stolen recipe.

334
00:15:48,997 --> 00:15:50,856
"Hey, Fat Tony. Homer here.

335
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:54,134
"You just threw me off a bridge. LOL.

336
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:58,138
If you pull me up,
I can save both our lives."

337
00:15:58,866 --> 00:16:00,641
Explain first.

338
00:16:00,868 --> 00:16:03,101
Then I pull you up.

339
00:16:04,888 --> 00:16:08,223
"Pull me up first.
Scary turtle down here.

340
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,484
"Also, running low on oxygen.

341
00:16:10,711 --> 00:16:13,061
Crying-laughing emoji."

342
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,867
If that TV show airs,
the Prussians are gonna find out

343
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,869
that you had the recipe all along

344
00:16:20,962 --> 00:16:22,370
and they're going to kill you.

345
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:25,040
But I can sneak us onto
the Chew Network lot,

346
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:27,375
and together we can stop that show.

347
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:30,103
- How?
- I'm a deranged fan.

348
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,306
All I do is think of ways
to sneak onto the lot.

349
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,410
Okay. Let's hurry before
the Prussians catch on.

350
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:47,412
Two Thad Parkour look-alikes here

351
00:16:47,564 --> 00:16:49,172
for the Clam Chowder Chug-a-thon.

352
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:51,758
Eh. Sounds like something we'd do.

353
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,741
Fat Tony, please,
you don't want to do this, man.

354
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,743
How did you steal my recipe?

355
00:17:01,762 --> 00:17:03,762
I took every precaution.

356
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:06,414
I made you turn around.

357
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:07,524
Wait a minute.

358
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:13,321
Your supercool backwards
sunglasses recorded everything!

359
00:17:17,944 --> 00:17:22,122
You broke my heart, Thad's sunglasses.

360
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,601
It's the Prussians! Run!

361
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,475
It would seem Maximillian is

362
00:17:50,627 --> 00:17:52,385
trying to process some big feelings.

363
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:55,888
His last memory of his
father is a bitter one.

364
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:57,908
His last memory?

365
00:17:58,135 --> 00:18:00,268
I know what to do. Give me the wheel!

366
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,803
- You, go under.
- No, you go under.

367
00:18:01,822 --> 00:18:03,972
- Your foot's in my gabagool.
- That's not my foot.

368
00:18:04,065 --> 00:18:05,398
That's not my gabagool.

369
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,542
Are you sure? It feels like one.

370
00:18:11,832 --> 00:18:14,407
What the hell just happened?

371
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,914
Where the fuggedaboutit are we?

372
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,226
Just trust me.

373
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,921
Wasn't enough just taking
my father's love from me,

374
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,924
you had to steal his recipe, too?

375
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,002
Uh, before you shoot,

376
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:37,505
just take a deep breath
through your nose.

377
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:41,025
There is nothing I could
smell that could save your...

378
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:46,873
<i>Because of what Fat Tony did,</i>

379
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,541
<i>people all over this town</i>

380
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:51,619
<i>are honoring your father's memory</i>

381
00:18:51,696 --> 00:18:55,215
<i>by making his most beloved dish.</i>

382
00:18:56,293 --> 00:18:59,293
<i>Gewalteintopf...</i>

383
00:18:59,682 --> 00:19:02,555
Eat. There is no cold in the world

384
00:19:02,707 --> 00:19:05,642
that can stand up to
Papa's special stew.

385
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:08,728
Oh, yum. What's in it?

386
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:12,807
That is a precious secret that
one day I will share with you.

387
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,292
For now, just eat.

388
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:17,812
And know that your father
loves you very much.

389
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,297
Now, let's see what adventures

390
00:19:19,315 --> 00:19:20,890
brave Colonel Klink is having

391
00:19:20,984 --> 00:19:24,619
with that buffoon Hogan
and his unruly friends.

392
00:19:25,714 --> 00:19:27,472
Father<i> did</i> love me.

393
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:29,490
And now that the world has his recipe,

394
00:19:29,643 --> 00:19:33,235
your father will never truly be gone.

395
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:35,496
Friedrich, put down the sax.

396
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:42,095
Thank you, Maximillian.

397
00:19:42,246 --> 00:19:45,156
Oh, and how's my youngest son doing?

398
00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:47,191
Really good.
He's super into mask-making.

399
00:19:47,193 --> 00:19:50,328
- How's mine?
- We're zeroing in on his allergies.

400
00:19:50,346 --> 00:19:51,996
His eyes stopped watering,

401
00:19:52,015 --> 00:19:55,108
and we're slowly adding things back in.

402
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:57,351
<i>Kitchen Betrayals</i> is a hit!

403
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,687
Now I can make other shows
where I travel the globe

404
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,507
exploring local food scenes
and fascinating cultures.

405
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:04,692
And, Homer, my friend, I want you,

406
00:20:04,844 --> 00:20:07,770
the man who saved me,
to join me on this journey.

407
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:11,849
I've heard the rest of the world
has slightly different toilets,

408
00:20:11,868 --> 00:20:13,460
and I'm scared of that.

409
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:16,546
Everything I need is right here.

410
00:20:18,374 --> 00:20:21,209
But, Homer, I mean,
this is growth for me.

411
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,695
Can't you respect my decision?

412
00:20:23,713 --> 00:20:24,787
No.

413
00:20:32,684 --> 00:20:34,316
_

414
00:20:46,852 --> 00:20:48,270
_

415
00:20:48,571 --> 00:20:50,663
Professor Lisa,
we've established contact

416
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,831
with the alien ship.

417
00:20:52,058 --> 00:20:53,908
As our lead astrophysicist,

418
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,562
you have the honor of conveying
humanity's first words

419
00:20:57,622 --> 00:21:00,006
to extraterrestrial life.

420
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,344
Visitors from another world...

421
00:21:04,495 --> 00:21:06,346
Visitors from another world!

422
00:21:06,497 --> 00:21:07,905
- Not now.
- Not now.

423
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:09,257
- Can you just...
- Can you just

424
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,000
- This is really important.
- This is really important.

425
00:21:11,094 --> 00:21:12,593
- God, you're annoying!
- God, you're annoying!

426
00:21:12,746 --> 00:21:15,263
<i>- Get the hell out of here.
- Get the hell out of here.</i>

427
00:21:15,415 --> 00:21:16,839
<i>- I hate you!
- I hate you!</i>

428
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:18,691
<i>- Everyone hates you!
- Everyone hates you!</i>

429
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:21,861
<i>- I'll kill you!
- I'll kill you!</i>

430
00:21:22,088 --> 00:21:23,771
Apparently, this species

431
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,439
has a war-like nature.

432
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,700
Commence obliteration.

433
00:21:27,852 --> 00:21:29,827
- <i>Your fault.
- Your fault.</i>

434
00:21:32,205 --> 00:21:33,581
Shh!

435
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,142
