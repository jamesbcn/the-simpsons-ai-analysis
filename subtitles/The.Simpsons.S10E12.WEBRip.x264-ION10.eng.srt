{\an8}I did until we came here last year.

{\an8}What's the point
of these other four numbers?

36
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,005
{\an8}Those are citizen relocation codes.

I'll start with a couple of pizzas,

79
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,531
then a complimentary tango lesson,

80
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:04,575

Eh... uh-oh. Wait a minute.

88
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,179

you need four new tires.

-Really?
-Yeah.

94
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,436
Legally, I can't even let you
drive out of here on these.

95

Oh, please, can't you let me
slide this time?

but if my boss found out...

Hey, what's going on over here?

98
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,826
Were you gonna let this man
drive out of here on unsafe tires?

99
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,252
No, boss. I swear.

100
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,250
Uh, that's it. You're fired!

101
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,752
No. Wait. This is all my fault.

102
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,915
Oh, if I could only turn back the clock

103
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,134

Ooh, I know that look. (giggles)

107
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,070
You came in for the free wheel balance

108
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,319
and now it's costing you 500 simoleans.

109
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,901
Six with the tip.

110
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,356
Hey, you got off easy.

111
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,656

112
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,029

I've always loved

157
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,177

It's really a good group.

178
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,570
Yeah. Not a dame in sight.

179
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,492
Oh, thank God.

180
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,241
Now we can stop holding it in.

181
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:14,083
(all sighing)

182
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,406
All aboard for Miami.

183
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,327
(all groaning)

184
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,544
I don't know if I can last that long.

185
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,707
Super Bowl, please, and step on it!

186
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,336
(all cheering)

187
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,264
Hey, wait up.

188
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,682
Ah, crap. It's that pip-squeak Rudy.

189
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,261
(panting)

190
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,098
What is it, Rudy?

191
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,181
Can I come, too?

192
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,425
Forget it, kid.

193
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,887
You're too small to go to the Super Bowl.

194
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,057
But what I lack in size,
I make up for in...

195
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,112
obnoxiousness. (grunts)

196
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,861
(all cheering)

197
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,700
("Wild Weekend" by NRBQ playing)

198
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,413
<i>♪ Hey, boys it's a wild weekend ♪</i>

199
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,333
-(raucous laughter)
-Whoo!

<i>♪ We did it then and we'll do it again ♪</i>

201
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:03,037
Well, sports fans, I see
you've located the beer supply,

202
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,125
so let's all enjoy it in moderation.

203
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,132
MAN: Boo!

204
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,803
Hey, don't make me come back there.

205
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,636
Seriously, now, if you have any questions,

206
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,178
just ask our team leader, Homer Simpson.

207
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,853
(singing drunkenly)

208
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,392
Or me. Be-- Better ask me.

209
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,111
(sighs)

210
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:27,398
It's so nice to have
a peaceful weekend together.

211
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,033
Yeah, I'm bored, too.

212
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,240
Mm-hmm.

213
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,949
Hey, why don't we do
one of those craft kits

214
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,450
Aunt Patty always gives us?

215
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:40,004
Hmm... ooh, how about Paint-By-Numbers?

216
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,869
It's so rigid and uncreative.

217
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,286
{\an8}OK.

218
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,884
{\an8}Oh, Leather Craft.

219
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,549
{\an8}Oh! Those poor, helpless cows.

220
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,714
{\an8}Mm-hmm. What about Clay?

221
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,877
{\an8}You got any problem with Clay?

222
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,086
Hey, what's this? (blows)

223
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,716
"Vincent Price's Egg Magic."

224
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,684
Well, what are we waiting for?

225
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,137
Keep-away Lovejoy's collar.

226
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,399
(all laughing)

227
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,269
Now look what you've done.

228
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,606
All right, all right,

229
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,651
you guys have had way too much booze.

230
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,066
Last call.

231
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,614
(clamoring)

232
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,742
Come on, come on, give me an excuse.

233
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,123
Pro player stadium, Super Bowl.

234
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:27,036
(all cheering)

235
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,168
(bleating)

236
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,927
(chuckles) I'm sorry.

237
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,509
The guys made kind of a mess
in your bathroom.

238
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,925
What bathroom?

239
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,313
Uh, OK, fellas, enjoy the pre-game fun.

240
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,231
I don't wanna be a panicky Pete,

241
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,850
but it's Sunday and I haven't
been to church yet.

242
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:50,067
No problem. The NFL's got you covered.

243
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,359
...and that the wandering Oakland Raiders

244
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,903
may someday find a home.

245
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,656
Lord, hear our prayer.
Can I get an amen to that?

246
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,870
ALL: Amen.

247
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,504
Cool! The NFL's oldest surviving player.

248
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,868
I'm 53 years young.

249
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,167
Ugh.

250
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,497
MAN: Whoo!

251
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,884
Hey, Troy Aikman.

252
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,880
So, Ned, you like dune buggies?

253
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,303
Well... (giggles) not my cup of...

254
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,513
Sure, you do.

255
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,182
Everyone likes dune buggies.

256
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,642
(grunts)

257
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,563
Great spiral, Daniel.

258
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,693
Man, that hurts.

259
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,149
Excuse me. Coming through.

260
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,359
Friends of Dan Marino.

261
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,358
OK, Dan, fire away.

262
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,190
(scoffs) I'm Dan's manager. This is Dan.

263
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,397
Go long, son.

264
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,317
Yes, sir.

265
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,951
(whimpering)

266
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,155
I'm catching a pass from Dan Marino.

267
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,536
This is the greatest moment of my--

268
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,962
Whoo-hoo! Homer Simpson with a pick!

269
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,631
Hey, Bubba, Hacksaw, get that moron.

270
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,251
(growling)

271
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,917
Uh-oh. Lateral to Bart!

272
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,005
(growling)

273
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,340
(screams)

274
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,505
-(cracking)
-HOMER: My spine.

275
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,479
Oh, honey, that is egg-ceptional.

276
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,729
(giggling)

277
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,651
OK, now we just have to stick
the feet on.

278
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,731
Right. Now... hmm.

279
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,107
Lisa, I don't want to alarm you
but I'm not finding any.

280
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,905
{\an8}But it clearly says feet included.

281
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,119
They have to be here.

282
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,158
No, nothing.

283
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,117
I can't believe Vincent Price

284
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,252
would lend his name
to such a shoddy product.

285
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,659
Now what do we do?

286
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,998
Let's call the company.

287
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,332
Mom, this was made in 1967.

288
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,788
They're probably out of business.

289
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,668
Well, we'll just see.

290
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,175
Murray Hill, 5-9-2-3-2.

291
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,628
(telephone ringing)

292
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,928
VINCENT (over telephone):
<i>Hello. This is Vincent Price.</i>

293
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,722
(gasps) It's Vincent Price.

294
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,015
I thought he was dead.

295
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,098
VINCENT: <i>You should know</i>
<i>the grave could never tame me.</i>

296
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,595
<i>(ghoulish laugh)</i>

297
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:54,896
Oh, Mr. Price, I loved you
in the <i>Abominable Doct--</i>

298
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,862
VINCENT: <i>If you are calling</i>
<i>about the missing feet,</i>

299
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,402
<i>leave your address</i>
<i>and the replacement feet</i>

300
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,527
<i>will be rushed to you by my grandson Jody.</i>

301
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,325
<i>And now, I must return</i>

302
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,578
<i>to the sweet embrace of the crypt,</i>

303
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,790
<i>but I'll be back.</i>

304
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,790
<i>(ghoulish laugh)</i>

305
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,922
So, is he alive or not?

306
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,999
-(beep)
-742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield.

307
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,166
Oh, hiya, Maude.

308
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,264
Come on in.

309
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,890
Who needs tickets? Tickets right here.

310
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,799
How about you, slick?

311
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,637
Scalping tickets to the Super Bowl.

312
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,433
Have you no shame, sir?

313
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,187
I should give you a royal caning.

314
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,438
(cheering in agreement)

315
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,772
Hey, hey, I'm just trying to make
an honest buck.

316
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:40,187
Ah, get lost, you bloodsucking parasite.

317
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,027
Wally and I have all the tickets we need.

318
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:46,198
Uh, sorry, fellas,
but these tickets are counterfeit.

319
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,163
-What?
-Counterfeit?

320
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,954
Yeah, see, the hologram's missing,

321
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,667
and there's no such team as The Spungos,

322
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:56,588
and finally, these seem to be
printed on some sort of cracker.

323
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,752
Stop eating our tickets!

324
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,758
Oh, how could I fall for fake tickets?

325
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,466
Gee, the fellas are gonna be crestfallen.

326
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,514
Yes, if by "crestfallen,"
you mean "kill us."

327
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,716
Listen, let me talk to them.

328
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,056
Maybe I can smooth this over.

329
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,142
(sweetly) My friends...

330
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,636
They don't have the tickets!

331
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:14,937
-Kill 'em!
-(all shouting)

332
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,560
Please, my friends... Ow!

333
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,477
All right! I'll get you into the game!

334
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,739
Excuse me, uh... Mr. Scalper, sir.

335
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,531
Have I told you that I love you?

336
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,494
Forget it.

337
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,874
You'll just hurt me like all the others.

338
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,411
OK, Moe, I believe
you had me by the throat.

339
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,575
Reverend Lovejoy was working the body.

340
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,374
Wait. Dad, look.

341
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,247
Hello.

342
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,205
Gentlemen, I have an idea.

343
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:43,916
(grunts) Run!

344
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,298
(cheering and hooting)

345
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,007
-OFFICER: Get back here!
-(whistling)

346
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,175
We can still make the kickoff!

347
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,814
Here comes the kick!

348
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,271
(yell crescendos)

349
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,402
Ow!

350
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,228
Yay!

351
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,614
As a doctor, I'd say he's had enough...

352
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,863
but as a football fan...

353
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:06,073
-(yell crescendos)
-Aaah!

354
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,200
(wind whistling)

355
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,173

MAN: <i>The church...</i>

358
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,685
<i>we've made a few changes.</i>

359
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,105
These Super Bowl commercials are weird.

360
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,605
MAN: <i>Just about ready</i>
<i>for the second quarter here in Miami.</i>

361
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,567
I tell you, Pat,

362
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,947
that wild first quarter
blew out my telestrator,

363
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,704
and now the fans are screaming for more.

364
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,656
(screaming)

365
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,156
Let us out of here!

366
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,917
Relax, Simpson, relax.

367
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,919
A little-known fact about jail cells

368
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,631
is they always have one phony bar
for, like, emergencies.

369
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,632
Real, real, real, real, real.

370
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,927
So, by the process of elimination,

371
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,301
this one is the fake.

372
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,723
(yells) Ah, that's painful.

373
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,638
(crowd cheering on TV)

374
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,556
Ah, nuts. That sounds like a touchdown.

375
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,766
(all groaning)

376
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,725
No, no, no. I know my roars,

377
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,186
and that was most definitely a safety.

378
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,356
(groaning)

379
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,284
Man.

380
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,822
Gosh, fellas, to see you all stuck in here

381
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,616
when even guys in China
can watch all the action

382
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,001
from their town squares or what have you,

383
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,248
well, I just feel pretty doggone bad.

384
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,211
If they were electing
a president of Dumbville,

385
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,961
I'd have to nominate me.

386
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,093
You got my vote.

387
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,749
Oh, we're never going to get out of...

388
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,125
Psst! Cleaning lady!

389
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,839
Would you let us out of here?

390
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,505
Me? I'm Dolly Parton.

391
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,224
I didn't ask for your life story,
just the key.

392
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:58,184
Young man, where I come from,
the South, folks say "please,"

393
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,187
and besides, I got to go sing a medley

394
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,849
with Rob Lowe and Stomp.

395
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,401
Dolly, wait!

396
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,480
Wally?

397
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,395
You know Dolly Parton?

398
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,743
Yeah. I book a lot of package tours
to Dollywood

399
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,069
and Euro-Dollywood.

400
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,074
That's in Alabama.

401
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,525
Wally Kogen,

402
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,284
what are you doing in Super Bowl jail?

403
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,037
Ask her if she'll go out with me.

404
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,199
We had a little ticket snafu.

405
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,498
Do you think you can bust
old Wally and his pals

406
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,422
out of the pokey?

407
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,919
Well, I do have

408
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,301
some of my extra-strength makeup remover.

409
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,588
Uh, shield your eyes.

410
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,255

412
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,678
Oh, thanks, Miss Parton.

413
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,513
Oh, way to go, Dolly.

414
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,428
-Thanks, babe.
-Will you go out with me?

415
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,015
Ooh, look at the time.

416
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,060
I better scoot to that halftime show.

417
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,274
See y'all.

418
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,018
Oh, man, that's gonna be some show.

419
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,738
Who's ready for some football?

420
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,489
Football!

cheering for an hour.

-Yeah, where's the game?

You guys are following me?

Well, I'm convinced.

Tell you what, Mr. Murdoch,

447

let's just split the difference.

448
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,270
The boys and I will just
crouch here quietly

449
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,731
and take it easy on the snacks...

450

We're rich!

How does it feel?

461
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,423
Did you ever stop believing?

462
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,881

Whoo! I'm going to Disneyland.

469
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,444
Really? Cause I'm a travel agent

470
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,648

Hey, how you doing?

476
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,488
You know, your determination and grit

477
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,075
under extreme pressure are an inspiration.

478
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,163
The whole country is proud of you.

479
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,116
Well, it's about time.

480
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,457
And on behalf of America, I'd like to--

481
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,422
Ow!

482
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,551

484
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,378
Hello? Hello?

485
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,965
I command you to answer me!

486
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,090
Hello?

487
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,761
Al, do you have to do that right now?

488
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,428
What are you gonna do
with your Super Bowl ring, Carl?

489
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,937
I'll probably give it to my wife.

490
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,149
It's our anniversary today.

491
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,649
ALL: Ah!

492
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,150
Dad, that doesn't belong to you.

493
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,532
But this might be my last chance
to win one.

494
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,529
Well, we sure put together
a heck of a trip, Homer.

495
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,112
Ever thought about being a travel agent?

496
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,567
Wally, I'd be lying if I said I hadn't.

497
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,868
Cause you can really "go places"
in the travel business.

498
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,123
(laughs)

499
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,714
Feel free to use that one.

500
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,669
What one?

501
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,250
Well, John, what did you think
of tonight's episode?

502
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,257
I loved it.

503
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,838
The last-minute addition
of Wally Kogen to the lineup

504
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,434
was a bit of a gamble,
but it really paid off.

505
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,890
Marge and Lisa painting eggs?

506
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:04,811
Did that work for you?

507
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,178
Oh, big time.

508
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,765
They came off the bench with a huge effort

509
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,980
that allowed Homer and Bart
to make some significant gains.

510
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,312
Did it strike you as odd

511
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,727
that in a Super Bowl show
with Dolly Parton,

512
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,936
we didn't see any football or singing?

513
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,606
I hadn't thought about it, Pat,

514
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,735
but in retrospect,
it was kind of a rip-off.

515
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,952
What a way to treat the loyal fans

516
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:27,042
who put up with so much nonsense
from this franchise.

517
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,579
Any final thoughts?

518
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,662
Nah, I'm too mad.

519
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:30,826
Let's get the heck out of here.

520
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,959
All aboard, boys.

521
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,962
I've been waiting for you.

522
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,551
Now, I'll tell you.
That doesn't make a lick of sense.

523
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,760
I know. Just get on the bus.

524
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:41,841

526
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,263
Wait, wait. I'll get it.

00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,218
JODY: Give it some gas, Grandpa.

528

You're not helping.
