1
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:14,013
Got to look good today.

2
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:15,848
I'm asking Amy to the prom.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,426
I meant school Amy.

4
00:00:19,503 --> 00:00:21,020
Not you, Amy.

5
00:00:21,096 --> 00:00:22,479
♪ <i>Oh</i> ♪

6
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,679
♪ <i>I said, are you gonna be
my girl?</i> ♪

7
00:00:31,757 --> 00:00:32,889
Okay, just act cool.

8
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:34,700
Hey, Amy, you promming?

9
00:00:34,777 --> 00:00:36,109
I...

10
00:00:36,186 --> 00:00:38,520
So, Amy, some of your hair
got caught in your locker

11
00:00:38,597 --> 00:00:40,614
and I took it. No! No! God, no!

12
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,450
Andrew, there's someone to see you!

13
00:00:46,397 --> 00:00:48,546
You've been served, starter stache.

14
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:50,473
Wh-What is this, Dad?

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,142
That's a subpoena.

16
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,219
You've been called as a
surprise witness in court today.

17
00:00:55,297 --> 00:00:56,554
I can't go to court.

18
00:00:56,632 --> 00:00:58,573
I spent all my after-school job money

19
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,058
on a skywriting promposal.

20
00:01:01,136 --> 00:01:03,245
Testifying in court is a
matter of duty and honor.

21
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:06,473
Besides, everyone knows Amy
is going to the prom with Josh.

22
00:01:08,143 --> 00:01:11,402
- ♪ <i>Are you gonna be my girl?</i> ♪

00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,647
- ♪ <i>Yeah.</i> ♪

24
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:15,315
Mr. Teen, isn't it true

25
00:01:15,317 --> 00:01:17,500
that while working as an
employee of Builders' Barn,

26
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,153
you rented a backhoe to this man

27
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:22,338
Homer J. Simpson?

28
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,417
Yes.

29
00:01:23,492 --> 00:01:25,175
And what reason did Mr. Simpson give

30
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,918
for renting the machine?

31
00:01:26,995 --> 00:01:28,937
To quote, "dig a bitching swimming pool

32
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:31,665
"in his backyard,
then throw an awesome pool party

33
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,608
and not invite Flanders."

34
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:35,610
But in the process of digging the pool,

35
00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:38,596
Mr. Simpson destroyed local gas, sewer,

36
00:01:38,674 --> 00:01:41,524
and power lines,
causing rolling blackouts

37
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,677
that affect Springfield to this...

38
00:01:44,727 --> 00:01:46,913
...day.

39
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:52,368
This man is so obviously incompetent

40
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,522
that he never should have been
allowed to rent a backhoe.

41
00:01:55,524 --> 00:01:58,282
And that is why Mr. Simpson

42
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,210
is suing Builders' Barn.

43
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,695
He's suing us?

44
00:02:01,697 --> 00:02:03,213
Your Honor, I'd like to take over

45
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,864
the questioning, if I may.

46
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:08,201
Mr. Simpson,
only a fool has himself for a lawyer.

47
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:10,562
That's exactly my point, sir.

48
00:02:12,557 --> 00:02:14,708
When Mr. Simpson, that is myself,

49
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,968
rented the heavy machinery in question,

50
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:20,396
isn't it true that my breath
smelled strongly of beer...

51
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,306
as it does now?

52
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,735
I don't know what beer smells like.

53
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,087
I was going to have my first one ever

54
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:29,889
at the after-prom party.

55
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,169
Homer can't even unfold a lawn chair.

56
00:02:34,246 --> 00:02:36,187
I don't think he understands doors.

57
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:39,899
He's fat and lazy and
carries diner jelly packs

58
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:41,751
in his shirt pocket.

59
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,327
That's irrelevant and prejudicial.

60
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:45,555
Let her speak!

61
00:02:45,925 --> 00:02:47,925
_

62
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:50,501
- Has the jury reached a verdict?
- Yes.

63
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,262
We're very disappointed this turned out

64
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,671
to be a real trial

65
00:02:53,749 --> 00:02:56,525
and not a hidden-camera
comedy reality show.

66
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:59,361
Also, we have no choice but
to find for the plaintiff.

67
00:02:59,437 --> 00:03:01,437
- D'oh!
- You're the plaintiff.

68
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,015
- Woo-hoo!
- I've spent 25 years

69
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:05,925
fighting for Lady Justice.

70
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:08,519
Today I learned she's
nothing but a painted tart,

71
00:03:08,597 --> 00:03:11,039
and I run the flophouse
where she turns tricks.

72
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:14,601
I award Mr. Simpson the
minimum possible damages.

73
00:03:14,603 --> 00:03:16,861
$95.

74
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,938
Yes! Come on, everybody.

75
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,275
Jury wave.

76
00:03:22,277 --> 00:03:24,511
No alternates.

77
00:03:26,757 --> 00:03:28,712
_

78
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,116
<i>Kids.</i>

79
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:32,635
Look what Daddy bought
with his settlement money.

80
00:03:33,807 --> 00:03:35,546
Floatie noodles and pool balls?

81
00:03:35,624 --> 00:03:37,791
We don't have a pool, Homer.

82
00:03:37,793 --> 00:03:39,793
We have a hole, which you can't fix

83
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:41,828
because the judge
banned you from renting

84
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,406
any class A excavating equipment.

85
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:46,466
It's now in the permanent court record

86
00:03:46,468 --> 00:03:48,134
that I married a buffoon.

87
00:03:48,136 --> 00:03:50,303
It was stipulated by all parties.

88
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:53,156
On the plus side,
Homer now has an entry on Wiccapedia.

89
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:56,400
"Homer J. Simpson is
the first American citizen

90
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:59,236
to become a court-certified idiot"?

91
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,149
Wow, and it's not just a stub.

92
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:05,168
The admin really put some time into it.

93
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:08,655
Is this what you want your
legacy on this planet to be?

94
00:04:08,657 --> 00:04:10,006
It's not just this.

95
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:11,749
I got other stuff, like, uh...

96
00:04:11,827 --> 00:04:13,676
I fell into wet cement
in front of the church

97
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,271
and left a very recognizable ass print.

98
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:17,606
- Mind the print.
- Aah!

99
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:19,107
Mind the ass print.

100
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:20,667
It's a big one.

101
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:23,002
And, uh, well, uh, there's, uh...

102
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:24,337
Ooh, I know.

103
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:26,114
My legacy can be Lisa.

104
00:04:26,191 --> 00:04:27,857
She's<i> my</i> legacy.

105
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,844
Aw, I called dibs on Lisa
in the delivery room.

106
00:04:30,846 --> 00:04:32,269
I saw her first.

107
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,542
<i>Legacy...</i>

108
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:40,620
Who are you?

109
00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:41,713
Where am I?

110
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,530
We're in the wonderful future.

111
00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:46,959
And I'm your guide,
travel host and author Rick Steves.

112
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:50,947
Every Sunday night Lisa puts
me on TV and you fall asleep.

113
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:53,299
That's why you're sleeping right now.

114
00:04:54,953 --> 00:04:58,686
<i>There's no better place for
a perfect gratin dauphinois</i>

115
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:00,881
<i>than on a train to Montrachet.</i>

116
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,217
Someday, Rick, someday.

117
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:06,145
These statues honor the
legacies of the many people

118
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,907
who made a difference in Springfield.

119
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,415
Sleep sleeping?

120
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,159
Legacy! Where's my statue?

121
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,586
You don't have one.

122
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:25,072
Because you've never done
anything worth remembering.

123
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,516
I bet Lenny doesn't
have a legacy statue.

124
00:05:27,518 --> 00:05:29,802
Look what we're standing on right now.

125
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,597
D'oh!

126
00:05:32,674 --> 00:05:35,491
Lenny invented invisible suspenders.

127
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,843
Guess what's holding up my pants.

128
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,847
The point is,
they're all remembered and you aren't.

129
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,000
Now let me ask you something else.

130
00:05:44,002 --> 00:05:45,944
Have you donated to PBS this year?

131
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,863
Never!

132
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:52,525
Dumb, stupid, dumb.

133
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:54,343
Abe, can you talk to him?

134
00:05:54,345 --> 00:05:56,621
He's been at the bottom
of that hole for hours.

135
00:05:56,698 --> 00:05:59,624
I've been feeding him like a dolphin.

136
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:09,300
So, what's got you sitting
in a hole this time, son?

137
00:06:09,377 --> 00:06:10,876
No legacy.

138
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,120
The nearest the Simpsons
ever came to a legacy

139
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:15,381
was when my uncle had
a soup named after him

140
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,957
at the chowder hall.

141
00:06:17,035 --> 00:06:20,036
A lot of people got sick from Stan soup.

142
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:23,389
So stop your ninny-whimpling
and get out of this hole.

143
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,650
Hey, you ruined my roundsie!

144
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,151
I ruin-sied your round-what?

145
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:29,320
When the ball goes all
the way around the walls,

146
00:06:29,397 --> 00:06:32,657
I call it a "roundsie."

147
00:06:32,734 --> 00:06:34,641
See? Roundsie.

148
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:36,719
That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen.

149
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:38,663
Let me try.

150
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,395
Whoa!

151
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:53,252
Son, I never played catch with you

152
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,754
or tossed you a football

153
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,589
or taught you how to ride a bike.

154
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:58,499
I hate you, you monster!

155
00:06:58,576 --> 00:07:00,501
But now we have this.

156
00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:03,187
Yeah... you're all right.

157
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:05,005
Noodles, balls?

158
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,266
What do you call this wonderful game?

159
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,511
I don't know, but it's gonna
be something really clever.

160
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:12,679
We call it Noodleball.

161
00:07:12,757 --> 00:07:14,757
It's exercise without movement.

162
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,592
It's safe for your brittle bones.

163
00:07:16,594 --> 00:07:17,943
And you don't have to face the thing

164
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,263
all us seniors fear about pools:

165
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:23,432
trying to peel off a wet bathing suit.

166
00:07:23,434 --> 00:07:25,451
- I'll try that.
- Give me one of those noodles.

167
00:07:31,234 --> 00:07:33,308
Dad, maybe Noodleball is what will make

168
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:35,294
the Simpson name live forever.

169
00:07:35,296 --> 00:07:38,572
A legacy that we created together.

170
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:41,242
I'll jelly to that.

171
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:48,232
_

172
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:50,751
Springfield's golden-agers are lining up

173
00:07:50,828 --> 00:07:52,235
to go six feet under...

174
00:07:52,313 --> 00:07:54,496
in empty swimming pools.

175
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:56,740
So how does this piscine pastime work?

176
00:07:56,817 --> 00:07:58,759
If you hit the ball
<i>past your opponents</i>

177
00:07:58,836 --> 00:08:00,761
<i>and it bounces back to you,</i>

178
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:02,763
<i>that's a roundsie: one point.</i>

179
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,007
<i>Your opponents are
trying to block the roundsie</i>

180
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:06,934
<i>and hit it back to
score their own point.</i>

181
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:09,270
<i>Play until three balls
get knocked out of the pool,</i>

182
00:08:09,346 --> 00:08:12,589
<i>and then everyone can check
their phone for ten minutes.</i>

183
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,442
So dive on in to Noodleball

184
00:08:14,518 --> 00:08:18,671
and drown the dog days of
summer in the deep end of fun.

185
00:08:18,673 --> 00:08:21,097
Speaking of dogs, let's meet the spaniel

186
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:24,243
who's predicted every Super Bowl wrong.

187
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:35,020
A perfect roundsie!

188
00:08:35,022 --> 00:08:36,371
We win again!

189
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:38,040
Since you've been playing Noodleball,

190
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:41,043
your weight gain has plateaued.

191
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:45,380
If you keep this up,
you could not gain 50 pounds.

192
00:08:45,457 --> 00:08:48,867
Dad, look what just
came up on Wiccapedia.

193
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:50,293
Hmm.

194
00:08:50,371 --> 00:08:52,871
The world is noticing the Simpsons...

195
00:08:52,873 --> 00:08:54,223
in a good way.

196
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:55,799
Look at these seniors,

197
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:58,152
playing like there <i>is</i> a tomorrow.

198
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:23,752
Dad, Grampa, we have

199
00:09:23,754 --> 00:09:25,179
a problem at the south pool!

200
00:09:25,256 --> 00:09:27,664
Oh, another old person three-way?

201
00:09:27,742 --> 00:09:28,907
Just hose 'em out of there.

202
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:30,017
Worse!

203
00:09:30,094 --> 00:09:32,094
Out of the pool, noodle heads.

204
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,337
It's summer, and the kids want to swim.

205
00:09:34,415 --> 00:09:36,190
Go jump in the lake, water baby.

206
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:38,025
You're in Noodleball country.

207
00:09:38,102 --> 00:09:41,270
Even the very tall need a place to swim.

208
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:44,532
And our children need to
cool off in the hot summer.

209
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:48,202
Won't everyone please not
think about the children?

210
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:57,545
Don't worry,
there's other pools in this town.

211
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,959
Hey, we were here first.

212
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,636
Talk to the tag.

213
00:10:07,557 --> 00:10:08,889
Vape 'em out!

214
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:12,134
It's cotton candy bubble gum.

215
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,635
Don't breathe it in.

216
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,401
We're losing pools all over town.

217
00:10:20,477 --> 00:10:23,070
What if we try to take over
some pickleball courts?

218
00:10:23,072 --> 00:10:25,631
No, those Wiffle Ball
whackers are psycho.

219
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:28,483
They killed tennis without
even breaking a sweat.

220
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,728
Dad, there's a new section
on your Wiccapedia page.

221
00:10:31,806 --> 00:10:33,972
Controversies.

222
00:10:33,974 --> 00:10:35,824
There's a petition to ban Noodleball,

223
00:10:35,826 --> 00:10:37,585
"which has antagonized swimmers,

224
00:10:37,661 --> 00:10:40,737
scuba practicers,
and frat house cannonballers."

225
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:42,648
Aw, that's all the thought leaders.

226
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,150
We can't let Noodleball
end up a failed sport,

227
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:47,243
like racquetball or soccer.

228
00:10:47,321 --> 00:10:49,822
Our father-son legacy is in danger.

229
00:10:49,824 --> 00:10:51,581
We got to do something.

230
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,659
Think! Think!

231
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:54,935
Hit harder!

232
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:56,270
Homer, Abe.

233
00:10:56,347 --> 00:10:58,513
There's someone here
who wants to see you.

234
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,257
I let him in
because he's wearing a suit.

235
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:03,259
Gentlemen, I'm Gabriel Razelton.

236
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:05,095
People call me "The Raz."

237
00:11:05,172 --> 00:11:06,780
But you shouldn't because I hate it.

238
00:11:06,857 --> 00:11:09,099
I represent a consortium
of companies that can help

239
00:11:09,176 --> 00:11:12,527
Noodleball not only survive but thrive.

240
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:14,346
What consortium?

241
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:17,866
I can tell you, or I can show you.

242
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,868
Uh, give us a minute.

243
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,703
Well, what do you think?
I'm all for show.

244
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,297
No, I think we should do tell.

245
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:25,540
- Let him show it...
- No, I prefer he'd tell it...

246
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:28,043
_

247
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,970
Okay, we want you to tell us.

248
00:11:30,047 --> 00:11:32,865
No, you idiot, we decided show!

249
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:35,050
Oh, just give us one more huddle.

250
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,703
Show! It was always show!

251
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:40,147
The avocado, or as some call it,

252
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:41,874
the alligator pear.

253
00:11:41,876 --> 00:11:43,317
Simple, natural,

254
00:11:43,394 --> 00:11:46,153
a little nutty, just like Noodleball.

255
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,730
"Avi-cado"? Never heard of it.

256
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:51,884
The only green thing I eat is
Marge's Mountain Dew pudding.

257
00:11:51,886 --> 00:11:53,902
Mm, oh.

258
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,997
That glop's easy on the gums.

259
00:11:57,074 --> 00:11:58,740
It is pretty creamy.

260
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:01,001
Are you sure it isn't lard?

261
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:02,336
Absolutely.

262
00:12:02,413 --> 00:12:04,487
You can see why we at
the Organic Pit-based

263
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:06,340
Enjoyment Council think that avocados

264
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:08,917
are the perfect sponsor for Noodleball.

265
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,752
Can you get us our pools back?

266
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:12,971
Oh, I can do better than that.

267
00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:17,834
I give you...

268
00:12:17,912 --> 00:12:20,020
the future of Noodleball.

269
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:22,172
This is the Avo-1 Noodleplex,

270
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:24,249
featuring eight state-of-the-art,

271
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:26,268
- empty, never-swum-in pools.
- Hmm.

272
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:27,861
Now, I hope you don't mind,

273
00:12:27,938 --> 00:12:29,604
but we've put a statue of you and Grampa

274
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:30,847
right at the entrance.

275
00:12:31,515 --> 00:12:33,258
We'll be remembered forever,

276
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,203
like that dude in the Lincoln Memorial.

277
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,206
We've got plans for all
kinds of avocado tie-ins:

278
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:41,875
oils, face masks, hair conditioners.

279
00:12:41,952 --> 00:12:44,211
Big A isn't just guac and chips.

280
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:49,717
Is this guy always so funny?

281
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:53,178
I don't know.

282
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:56,890
So, can we make this deal happen

283
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,301
and raise an avocado toast?

284
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,878
Oh, son.

285
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:05,290
We created a sport
that will live forever.

286
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:07,901
Now, Grampa,
we've got a PR guy just down the hall

287
00:13:07,978 --> 00:13:10,404
who wants to hear the
story of your life.

288
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:11,505
Hmm.

289
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,984
When I was a boy,
you kissed any horse that walked by.

290
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:19,304
And that's how I acquired
my taste for hay.

291
00:13:19,306 --> 00:13:21,807
Homer, I've always been honest
with you, right?

292
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:23,475
- Right.
- Wrong.

293
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:25,827
I lied when I said
Noodleball was for everyone.

294
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:28,146
No one's going to pay to
watch ancient athletes

295
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:30,482
break their hips and have heart attacks.

296
00:13:30,484 --> 00:13:33,977
Our vision of Noodleball is
for a younger demographic.

297
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:37,155
You want to make Noodleball
only for 20-somethings?

298
00:13:37,157 --> 00:13:38,991
Oh, God, no, they don't have any money.

299
00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:41,101
I'm talking 40-to-60-year-olds.

300
00:13:41,178 --> 00:13:44,162
The last generation
that can afford houses.

301
00:13:44,164 --> 00:13:46,774
We have to scrub out
every trace of your father

302
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,001
and his gang of shuffling catheters,

303
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:50,836
or Noodleball's future is blacker

304
00:13:50,838 --> 00:13:52,696
than a recently opened avocado.

305
00:13:54,842 --> 00:13:56,599
I can't dump Grampa.

306
00:13:56,677 --> 00:13:59,269
He's my father. We're like brothers.

307
00:13:59,346 --> 00:14:00,996
Oh...

308
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:04,533
I'm sorry, but my dad and I

309
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:06,201
created Noodleball together.

310
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,039
You're a man of rare integrity.

311
00:14:09,074 --> 00:14:11,784
- But I accept your deci...
- I'll do it! The old man's out!

312
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,879
_

313
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,288
Homer, Marge!

314
00:14:18,365 --> 00:14:20,032
Welcome to the first Noodleball

315
00:14:20,034 --> 00:14:21,141
celebrity tournament.

316
00:14:21,218 --> 00:14:22,717
Pretty fantastic, huh?

317
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:25,103
It's a very impressive tent.

318
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,597
Whoever ironed it knew
what they were doing.

319
00:14:27,674 --> 00:14:29,324
Avocado oil Bellini?

320
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,600
Get that crap out of my face.

321
00:14:30,677 --> 00:14:32,084
Now come, I want you to meet

322
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,104
some of the amazing
youth-adjacent athletes

323
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,421
who are competing today.

324
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,849
- Blake Griffin.
- Noodleball is the perfect game

325
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:40,944
for retired players whose bodies
have been permanently destroyed

326
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:42,228
by the sport they love.

327
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:43,947
Which is all of us.

328
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:47,025
Ow! My spinning finger.

329
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:48,118
It was supposed to be fixed

330
00:14:48,194 --> 00:14:50,954
after my third Meadowlark Lemon surgery.

331
00:14:51,031 --> 00:14:52,530
Homer Simpson,

332
00:14:52,607 --> 00:14:54,624
of course you know Megan Rapinoe.

333
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:56,626
I bet Lisa knows who you are.

334
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:59,629
Lisa Simpson? I love her Substack.

335
00:14:59,706 --> 00:15:02,782
If you're her dad,
this explains so much.

336
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:05,117
Thank you, Megan Rapinoe.

337
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,695
Our targeted marketing
to 40- and 50-somethings

338
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:09,531
is really paying off.

339
00:15:10,147 --> 00:15:12,200
My whole life I've worshipped

340
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,978
the false god of tucking in.

341
00:15:15,055 --> 00:15:16,629
Step-in shoes!

342
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:20,567
Oh! I'll never lower my
arms below my knees again.

343
00:15:21,969 --> 00:15:24,045
This is so amazing.

344
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:26,489
I just feel bad that Grampa
and the other old folks

345
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:28,491
can't be a part of all this.

346
00:15:28,568 --> 00:15:31,435
Yeah, that's kind
of a sensitive subject.

347
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,904
You did tell him, right?

348
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,390
You know, hard conversations like this,

349
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,484
it's all about picking the right moment.

350
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,486
- Oh, Homer.
- Darling.

351
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,413
- Homer.
- My beloved.

352
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,248
Are you waiting for your father to die

353
00:15:44,325 --> 00:15:48,327
so you won't have to tell him
you totally screwed him over?

354
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,405
- Little bit.
- Oh.

355
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:54,409
That alligator-pear-pushing
parasite gave me the heave-ho!

356
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,094
Doesn't he know we're a team?

357
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,687
We invented this together!

358
00:15:57,764 --> 00:15:59,914
Oh, great, now your memory's good.

359
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,266
This was the only way
to save Noodleball.

360
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:04,435
At least one of us can have a legacy.

361
00:16:04,512 --> 00:16:06,863
And you betrayed me for that?

362
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,106
Guess what.

363
00:16:08,182 --> 00:16:10,533
Legacy don't mean squat.

364
00:16:13,688 --> 00:16:16,053
Squat?! Justify yourself!

365
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:18,282
Who cares what people
think after you're gone?

366
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:20,210
You ain't there to get the credit,

367
00:16:20,286 --> 00:16:21,878
if they remember you at all.

368
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:24,047
Do you know who Johnny Carson was?

369
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:25,440
Nope.

370
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,217
- David Letterman?
- Nuh-uh.

371
00:16:27,293 --> 00:16:28,459
Jimmy Fallon?

372
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:30,053
Now you're just making up names.

373
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,113
Don't you see? You sold me out

374
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:35,133
for a few extra words in your obituary.

375
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:36,801
What's an obituary?

376
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:39,879
It's where they summarize
your whole life in one sentence.

377
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:41,122
Mine's gonna read:

378
00:16:41,124 --> 00:16:44,550
"He was stabbed in the back by his son."

379
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,219
A real father would
support his son's terrible,

380
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,888
heartless decision!

381
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,741
Dad, someday can I screw you out
of something<i> we</i> create together?

382
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:54,744
You do and I'll destroy you.

383
00:16:54,821 --> 00:16:57,914
How could making a deal with
avocados be a bad thing?

384
00:16:57,991 --> 00:16:59,565
It's a good fat.

385
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,585
Well, growing avocados
does use a lot of water.

386
00:17:02,662 --> 00:17:05,663
Over nine and a half
billion liters per day.

387
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,590
What's that in swimming pools?

388
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:10,075
3,800.

389
00:17:10,153 --> 00:17:12,320
And the transport of avocado products

390
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:15,473
endangers wildlife everywhere.

391
00:17:21,181 --> 00:17:23,514
Avocado oil is just using Noodleball

392
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,833
to cover up the bad stuff they do.

393
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:28,445
You know, the way
Middle East oil spent billions

394
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:30,763
to create LIV Golf.

395
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,264
LIV Golf can't be bad.

396
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,617
I bleed Mickelson's Maniacs blue.

397
00:17:34,694 --> 00:17:38,513
And now avocado oil is playing
the same slippery game.

398
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,364
No, no, I won't believe it.

399
00:17:40,441 --> 00:17:43,518
Not the Organic Pit-based
Enjoyment Council.

400
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,462
You mean OPEC?

401
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:48,965
Oh, "pit-based" is kind of a cheat,
but I get it.

402
00:17:49,116 --> 00:17:51,375
I sold out my dad for avocado.

403
00:17:51,452 --> 00:17:52,802
Oil, that is.

404
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:54,119
Green gold.

405
00:17:54,197 --> 00:17:55,722
Tex-Mex tea.

406
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:02,053
I demand to play in the tournament!

407
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:03,538
Of course you can.

408
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,982
You're on the cover
of<i> Avocado Aficionado.</i>

409
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:09,486
Oh, yeah, one went up my butt.

410
00:18:09,562 --> 00:18:12,471
Your partner, NFL legend Andrew Luck,

411
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,048
is waiting for you.

412
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,140
Join me, Homer.

413
00:18:15,218 --> 00:18:16,493
I need a new sport.

414
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:18,720
My wife keeps telling me to
stop moving furniture around

415
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,145
and get out of the house.

416
00:18:20,223 --> 00:18:21,723
Andrew, if I played with you,

417
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,242
I'd secure my Noodleball legacy forever.

418
00:18:24,318 --> 00:18:27,528
But at the terrible price
of supporting Big Avocado.

419
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,565
So there's another retiree
who I'm teaming up with.

420
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:32,567
My father.

421
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,344
We created Noodleball to keep

422
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,420
old people mobile and healthy.

423
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:38,072
We're taking our sport back,

424
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:39,516
legacy be damned.

425
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:43,244
And my son and I
challenge your best team.

426
00:18:43,246 --> 00:18:46,356
Do you and this walking
wrinklebag really expect to beat

427
00:18:46,432 --> 00:18:48,358
Blake Griffin and Megan Rapinoe?

428
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:49,584
We're playing now?

429
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,769
I just had three avocado Bellinis.

430
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:54,088
What is it with you and Bellinis?

431
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,015
They loosen me up, Megan.

432
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,538
Thanks for bringing me back, son.

433
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,266
Dad, we never played catch
or tossed a football,

434
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:07,192
but we have this.

435
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,861
You're right, son.

436
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:10,863
And that's why we're gonna win.

437
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,199
We are this safe, low-impact game.

438
00:19:19,406 --> 00:19:21,282
Ow, my hip!

439
00:19:21,284 --> 00:19:23,393
Ow, my heart!

440
00:19:25,121 --> 00:19:26,954
Noodleball is no more.

441
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:29,715
In its league premiere,
founder Homer Simpson

442
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,569
and his father suffered
gruesome career-ending injuries,

443
00:19:32,645 --> 00:19:34,887
ruining Noodleball's professional debut

444
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:37,632
and sending avocado futures plummeting.

445
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,726
Oh, my sport is dead,

446
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:44,488
and the only guy who showed up
to sign my cast is Andrew Luck.

447
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:46,916
Ooh, I get the whole space.

448
00:19:46,993 --> 00:19:48,492
Mm-hmm.

449
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:50,978
Cheer up, Homer,
retirement is wonderful.

450
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,422
You'll have so much more time to spend

451
00:19:52,498 --> 00:19:54,332
on your charities and with your family.

452
00:19:54,408 --> 00:19:57,985
Oh! I want a second opinion
from Peyton Manning.

453
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:00,988
I'm proud of you, Homie.

454
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,583
You stuck by your dad
and rejected Big Avocado.

455
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:08,162
Although if it comes in a salad,
I'm not sending it back.

456
00:20:08,164 --> 00:20:09,254
I love it on a burger.

457
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:11,357
Or just spooned right out of the skin.

458
00:20:13,998 --> 00:20:15,928
If we just swam in those pools,

459
00:20:16,005 --> 00:20:18,840
none of this bad stuff
would've happened.

460
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:22,510
Aw, but the water's so
chilly when you first go in.

461
00:20:23,336 --> 00:20:25,747
Nothing good came out of this.

462
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,701
This is that backhoe-renting
weirdo's house, Amy.

463
00:20:30,778 --> 00:20:33,112
Oh, Andrew, you were so brave

464
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:34,964
to testify against him.

465
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,691
Mmm.

466
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,468
Oh, my.

467
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:55,151
<i>Official Rules of Noodleball,
section 29:</i>

468
00:20:55,228 --> 00:20:57,153
<i>if a dog steals your pool ball,</i>

469
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,138
<i>you're allowed to steal its ball.</i>

470
00:20:59,215 --> 00:21:01,140
<i>All players must count up their meds,</i>

471
00:21:01,217 --> 00:21:03,826
<i>and the one with the
most pills serves first.</i>

472
00:21:03,903 --> 00:21:06,237
<i>The pool noodle
may be blown through</i>

473
00:21:06,313 --> 00:21:07,646
<i>but not yelled through.</i>

474
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,148
<i>In between points, a maximum</i>

<i>four if the kids are costumed

478
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,918
<i>that player must call "Flopper,"</i>

479
00:21:20,995 --> 00:21:24,906
<i>and the play is suspended

480
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:28,685
<i>If the pool being played
in has a separate hot tub,</i>

481
00:21:28,761 --> 00:21:30,395
<i>nice.</i>

482
00:21:34,267 --> 00:21:35,917
