1
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:10,677
D'oh!

2
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,513
Mmm...

3
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:32,265
My daughter's here
for her first mani-pedi.

4
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,367
Mom, I'm glad you brought me here,

5
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:39,439
but isn't it more important for a woman
to be smart and powerful than beautiful?

6
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,210
A woman can be smart, beautiful,
and powerful, like Queen Elizabeth I.

7
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,305
She had it all.
Except the most important thing.

8
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:52,114
Please don't say 'a man.'
- No! A husband!

9
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,449
The year was 1588, 400 years...

10
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:59,025
...before Kirk Gibson
would hit his famous home run.

11
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,628
Queen Elizabeth ruled over all of England.

12
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,365
Every eligible bachelor in Europe
wanted her hand in marriage.

13
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,865
Majesty, thy suitors await.

14
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,036
I don't understand why I need a king.

15
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,404
So you can pump out a son...

16
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,840
...and then I don't gotta
work for no broad...

17
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,940
...no more.

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,175
My liege.

19
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,608
Announcing Prince Ralph of Austria!

20
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:22,174
Off with my head!
- Pass.

21
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,750
King Julio of Spain.

22
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,188
Hello, Queenie baby.

23
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,925
Forget it. I've seen you
making goo-goo eyes at my court jester.

24
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,594
Well, I like a man who can make me laugh!

25
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,630
But for you, I'll make an exception.

26
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:42,902
Hands off my harlequin! This is 1588,
and his material is fresh and hip.

27
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,892
You have made a big mistake, lady!

28
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:49,602
His Excellency Sir Walter Raleigh.

29
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:52,812
Hmm...

30
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:56,716
Your Majesty, I have returned
from the New World with a gift.

31
00:01:56,816 --> 00:02:00,386
This healthful and slimming herb, tobacco.

32
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,626
Ooh!

33
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:12,189
If I ever have sex,
this'll be great afterwards.

34
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,102
I'll show those
uppity English food boilers.

35
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,204
What is the status of my armada?

36
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,341
A hundred and twenty of the finest
killing machines ever built.

37
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:25,178
Ooh! Not bad. Not bad at all.
Now take me to the real ones.

38
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,781
Those are the real ones.
'Watch out, England.'

39
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,616
'No! Have mercy, my lord!'

40
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:30,784
'Never.'
- Guards!

41
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,686
Take him away
and put things inside of him.

42
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,676
Nice things?
- No. Not nice things.

43
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,696
Allow me.

44
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:44,998
Ooh!

45
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:50,793
You have the strength of a plow horse
but the charm of a cart horse.

46
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:53,506
SELMA: Treason!

47
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,443
How dare you make out
under my crenelations...

48
00:02:56,543 --> 00:03:00,380
...while I make out not?
Don't you know that I love you?

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,480
I've always loved you!

50
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,652
Which one of us are you talking to?

51
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:09,189
I'm not sure. Both! Neither!
What difference does it make?

52
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,857
Take them to the Tower!

53
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,860
Whoa. Someone call Beowulf!
Grendel got in again!

54
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,130
It's you, Your Majesty.

55
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:22,735
The Spanish Armada sails for England.
- Armada? What's 'armada'?

56
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:24,404
Nothing. What's armada with you?

57
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,775
Seriously, though,
we're in real trouble here.

58
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,310
Come, Tea Biscuit.

59
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,136
The time of battle grows nigh.

60
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,326
MOE: So here's us, and
a whole lot of them.

61
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:51,356
It's probably a little too early
to be standing under this.

62
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:56,870
Lord Jesus, although our country
turned Protestant for the sole reason...

63
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,106
...that our fat, mean king
could dump his faithful wife,

64
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,800
we know you're on our side.

65
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,878
So please destroy these
horrible monsters...

66
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,580
...who believe your mother
should be revered.

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,680
Amen.

68
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,222
Abandon ship!

69
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,498
Normally, I love to see flaming dreamboats
headed my way,

70
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,913
but not like this, baby! Not like this!

71
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:38,522
For destroying the Spanish Armada,
I dub thee 'Sir' Sir Walter Raleigh.

72
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,698
And I grant you two my blessing.

73
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:49,022
Your Majesty, it's so kind of you
to give up the one man you truly loved.

74
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:55,752
I don't need a man. For I have England!
- Yeah. You keep telling yourself that.

75
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,632
You keep soaking.
We're going to Koo Koo Roo.

76
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,101
Which in our language means nothing.

77
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:05,939
Lisa, you are going to look so pretty.
- Thank you.

78
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:10,109
But I know a story of a dangerous
obsession with female beauty.

79
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:13,213
It's called Snow White and the Seven...

80
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,415
Excuse me. The story
you're about to tell...

81
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,551
...is the copyrighted property
of the Walt Disney Corporation.

82
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,619
Can you sharpen these?

83
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:23,189
Excuse me, but Snow White is a
fairytale from hundreds of years ago.

84
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:26,593
No one owns that.
- Are there any dwarves in your story?

85
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,963
Yes. But they're my own original creation.

86
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:35,023
There's Crabby, Drunky, Hungry,
Greedy, Lenny...

87
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,838
Kearney!
- LISA: And Doc... tor Hibbert.

88
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,539
Ho-hi...

89
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,013
...Ho-hi, ho-hi

90
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,513
It's off to work Ho-hi

91
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,818
This song's not like any song you know

92
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:56,116
Ho-hi Ho-hi, ho-hi, ho-hi

93
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:03,463
LISA: Little did they know their lives
were about to be changed forever,

94
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,563
by a wicked queen.

95
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:10,159
HDTV on the wall,
who's the fairest one of all?

96
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:17,644
You would do in a pinch, my queen.
But Snow White's the fairest I have seen.

97
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,913
Also, there's a weather girl
on Channel 9 who's...

98
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,586
Bring me Snow White's heart in this box.

99
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,621
What'll I do with the rest of the body?

100
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,716
Put it in this box.
Then you'll get your reward.

101
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:45,174
Now turtle, I'll need you
to get in the soup.

102
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,978
I... I cannot do it!

103
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,855
Run, lassie!
Find wee little men and hide with them!

104
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,795
Now to fool the queen with a pig's heart.

105
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,895
I... I cannot do it!

106
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:16,169
Maybe I'll make her a heart
out of construction paper!

107
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,965
I... I cannot do it!

108
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,730
Let's see. Gingerbread house.

109
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,177
Grandma's house.

110
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,714
Ah! Here we are.

111
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,173
All that walking made me sleepy.

112
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,059
This bed's too hard.

113
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,730
This bed's too soft.

114
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:52,030
And this bed is just...

115
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,741
...like the first one! Also too hard!

116
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,643
I guess I'll sleep in
the one that's too soft.

117
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,387
Ho-hi, ho-hi It's time to now get high

118
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,023
We'll take some shrooms
and go to our rooms...

119
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,728
There's something in our house.
- Let's put a pickax in its brain!

120
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,164
You're in marketing.
Why do you even bring an ax?

121
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,409
If you were in marketing, you'd know.

122
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,833
She's beautiful!

123
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,077
Maybe she's been placed
under some kind of a curse.

124
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,980
And all that will wake her
is the kiss of a handsome...

125
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,615
I'm awake! I'm awake, already!

126
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:40,012
Guess it's you and me again, doorknob.

127
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,389
Goodbye!

128
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:47,527
Now beware of the evil queen.
She's a master of disguise.

129
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:50,696
She could be anyone.
- I'll be careful.

130
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,680
No, no, no! That's too much!
Go back outside!

131
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,049
Who are you?
- Care for an apple?

132
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,516
Okay. I'll take a green one.

133
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,619
No! Take the red one.

134
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,357
Take a bite, deary.

135
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,503
Uh-oh!

136
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,898
You'll never take me alive!

137
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,708
Ooh!

138
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:39,175
Herbivores! I'm so scared!

139
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:47,620
LISA: So Snow White slept
and waited for her prince to come.

140
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,720
But he never did.

141
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,325
Because a woman shouldn't
have to depend on a man.

142
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,561
Snow White was brought back to life
by a lady doctor.

143
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,630
And she lived happily ever after?

144
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,300
Well, she couldn't indulge in
strenuous activities like handball,

145
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,970
but otherwise, she was fine.
- That's nice.

146
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:10,810
Marge! I need some bribe money.
- Well, don't say it so loud.

147
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,990
All I have are some dry-cleaning coupons.
- Deal.

148
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,050
Thanks, Marge. But don't forget,
there's still going to be a civil suit.

149
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,387
Lisa, let me tell you the story...

150
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:27,255
...of a great woman held back by
a not-so-great husband. Macbeth.

151
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,962
Out, damn spot! Out, I say!

152
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:36,335
Marge, please. If you don't like
getting barbecue sauce out of a leotard,

153
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:39,906
why did you get into show business?
Think before you do.

154
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:44,744
I wouldn't be stuck washing costumes
if my husband had a better role.

155
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,837
Well, I may be playing a tree,

156
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,815
but at least I'm getting
my face out there.

157
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,519
I thought I was marrying a man
who could play Macbeth.

158
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,822
Hey, there's no way I could ever be
as good as that guy.

159
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:59,049
Stars, hide your fires;

160
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:03,788
Let not light see
my black and deep desires.

161
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,934
Mel's like the son Laurence Olivier
and John Gielgud...

162
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:11,604
...always wanted but never had.
But, oh, how they tried.

163
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:15,902
I think Mel would be happier
as an understudy.

164
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,708
A six-feet-understudy.

165
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,276
You're not suggesting murder?

166
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,150
Wouldst thou live a coward
in thine own esteem...

167
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,990
...letting 'I dare not'
wait upon 'I would'?

168
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,764
Whatever you say, sweetie.

169
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,225
Snore!

170
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,928
Snore!

171
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,833
Oh! A prop knife!

172
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,634
Out, out, brief candle.

173
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,223
Life's but a walking shadow.

174
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,715
Why does everyone around here
talk that crazy talk?

175
00:11:55,815 --> 00:12:00,047
That crazy talk is the work
of the immortal bard,

176
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,313
William Shakespeare.

177
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,223
Well, if you see him in heaven,
tell him he sucks.

178
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,230
As you all know, this afternoon,

179
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,600
the bone fell out of Mel's hair
and beat him to death.

180
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,569
Let us observe a moment of silence.

181
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,814
Moment over. Homer, you got the lead.

182
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:27,012
Stay, you imperfect speakers,
tell me more:

183
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,080
Um...

184
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,480
By Sinel's death
I know I am thane of Glames.

185
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,253
Uh...

186
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:37,423
To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow...

187
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:40,960
Today's Tuesday,
so that would make it Friday, and then...

188
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,363
Shakespeare!
- You don't even know your lines.

189
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,633
Conrad Birdie?
Coming here to Sweet Apple?

190
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,733
That's Bye Bye, Birdie.

191
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,105
Damn it, Morpheus!
Not everyone believes what you believe!

192
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,541
That's the screenplay
for The Matrix Reloaded.

193
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,641
D'oh!

194
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,077
I can't wait for the reviews!

195
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,919
'Tonight the Springfield
Community Playhouse...

196
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,955
'was bathed in the light
of a brilliant new star...

197
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:13,492
'Dr. Hibbert as Banquo'?
- Who the hell is Banquo?

198
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:16,362
He's the one getting the good reviews!

199
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,531
Which makes him the next one
you've got to kill!

200
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,100
Wouldn't it be easier
if I just took acting lessons?

201
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,971
Screw your courage to the sticking-place,
and we'll not fail!

202
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,607
That's inspiring!
What's that from? X- Men 2?

203
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,707
Macbeth!
- Macwho?

204
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,364
This number is for emergencies only.

205
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,270
He who laughs last...

206
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,913
...laughs dead.

207
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,419
'In last night's Macbeth,

208
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,388
'the best performance was
Barney Gumble as Duncan,

209
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:20,092
'followed by Duffman as Macduff,
Lenny Leonard as Lennox,

210
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,862
'Eddie and Lou as the two soldiers
without lines,

211
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:26,432
'then last, and least,
the lead, Homer Simpson.'

212
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,635
Why do they write a new review
of this play every single day?

213
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:33,372
All I heard was more names of actors
you haven't killed!

214
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:38,110
Unless you're not man enough!
- No, dear. I'm a man, dear.

215
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,788
Killing makes me hungry

216
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,417
Eating makes me thirsty

217
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,267
Drinking makes me sleepy

218
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,501
Why did he have to kill everyone
in their costumes?

219
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:07,402
It was you who killed us! You!
- No! It was Homer!

220
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:11,143
Your dark ambition
guided his murderous hand!

221
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:16,173
No, I just encouraged him.
- Encouraged by withholding sex!

222
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,582
Sex!

223
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:32,391
Well, at least you can't nag me anymore.

224
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,802
That's where you're wrong.
Get out on that stage!

225
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,373
Okay, Homer. It's our last performance.

226
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,844
You're the only actor that's still alive,
and there's nobody in the audience.

227
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,645
This is your moment.

228
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:50,449
I'll be in my office going over the books
on my Subway Sandwich franchise.

229
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,752
You call a sandwich maker an artist,
it's like an invitation to steal.

230
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,789
That guy's going
nani-nooni-bananas in there.

231
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,889
It's my moment!

232
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,689
To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow,

233
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:13,599
creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
to the last syllable of recorded time.

234
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:19,112
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
the way to dusty death.

235
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,806
Out, out, brief candle!

236
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,316
Life's but a walking shadow,

237
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:29,154
a poor player that struts
and frets his hour upon the stage,

238
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,789
and then is heard no more.

239
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:38,387
Homie. You were brilliant.
I knew you could do it. I knew it.

240
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:44,503
Now nothing will stop you from taking on
all of Shakespeare's greatest roles.

241
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:48,664
King Lear, Hamlet, Othello, Richard III,

242
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,645
Henry IV, Part One,
Henry IV, Part Two, Henry V,

243
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:53,712
Titus Andronicus...

244
00:16:55,881 --> 00:17:00,896
Me having to read all those plays
would be the real tragedy.

245
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:08,191
That's it. Three stories.
That's all we always tell.

246
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,173
Looks like Maggie wants a story, too.

247
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,265
Ooh!

248
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:18,938
Mom! Isn't that book
the Bible of right-wing losers?

249
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,943
Yeah. But the guy on the book jacket
is one sexy slice of beefcake.

250
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,644
So anyway, this is the story
of Maggie Roarke,

251
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:33,063
an architect who refused to compromise.

252
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,589
Now children,
while I do traffic school online,

253
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,239
you'll be playing with blocks.

254
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:48,734
MARGE: Maggie's genius and creativity
far exceeded that of the others.

255
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,437
And I'm not just saying that
because I'm her mother.

256
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:57,339
But her teacher, Mr. Elsworth Toohey,
wanted every child to conform.

257
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:01,747
Banal. Very banal. Wonderfully pedestrian.

258
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:07,152
This isn't right.
Maggie, dancers shouldn't kick too high,

259
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,122
and buildings mustn't reach the sky.

260
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,992
There!

261
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:17,329
Your rubble is still a little bit higher
than the others, so let's just...

262
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,733
There. Welcome to the real world, baby.

263
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:25,083
MARGE: He would not let
Maggie's creativity flower.

264
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,967
Mediocrity rules!

265
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,846
All right, Maggie.
Today is parent/teacher day,

266
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:12,851
so I want everyone to see how uncreative
and beaten down you've become.

267
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:16,861
That's right. You're beaten down.
Yes, you are.

268
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,196
I don't know how you put up
with all these kids, Toohey.

269
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:27,666
If I were you,
there'd be a lot of strangled babies.

270
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,702
Now let's see what your children
have done, shall we?

271
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:35,052
Don't brace yourselves.
You will believe your eyes.

272
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,915
You will be tried as a toddler!

273
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,287
Babies and gentlemen of the jury.

274
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,353
This child's crime was to remind...

275
00:19:51,453 --> 00:19:53,592
...the rest of us that
we are merely ordinary.

276
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,595
When a blade of grass rises
above the others, do we applaud it?

277
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,564
No! We cut it down!

278
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:03,124
I recommend nine time-outs
served consecutively.

279
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,913
Throughout the ages, the finger painter,
the Play-Doh sculptor, the Lincoln Logger,

280
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,950
stood alone
against the daycare teacher of her time.

281
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,853
She did not live to
earn approval stickers.

282
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,622
She lived for herself,
that she might achieve things...

283
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,991
...that are the glory of all humanity.

284
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:29,461
These are my terms.
I do not care to play by any others.

285
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,198
And now, if the court will allow me,
it's naptime.

286
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,439
MARGE: Maggie grew up
to be a world-famous architect.

287
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:44,874
Her building became
one of the wonders of the world.

288
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:51,677
And on the very top floor
was a daycare center,

289
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:55,554
where every child was free
to follow their dream.

290
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:56,688
Because nothing is...

291
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:59,423
...Maggie, get away from there!

292
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,192
Bad baby!

293
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,967
Ho-hi

294
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:17,440
Ho-hi, ho-hi It's time to say goodbye

295
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,745
If Disney sues we'll claim their use

296
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:24,509
Ho-hi, ho-hi, ho-hi, ho-hi

297
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:30,945
Ho-hi, ho-hi, there's nothing we won't try

298
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,258
We'll get take-out and then make out

299
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:38,022
We're bi, we're bi, we're bi, we're bi

300
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,881
English - US - SDH
