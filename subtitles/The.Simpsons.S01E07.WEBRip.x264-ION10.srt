Shut up, Flanders.

Hey, Dad, how come we can't get
a decent mower, like the Flanders have?

Just be happy with what you've got, son.
Don't try to keep up with the Flanders'.

Bart! I suppose it has,
various features.

Microwave, dish washer,

big screen TV, deep fryer
and, see up there on the roof?

15

- A satellite dish!
- Yes, indeedly-doodly.

But, how can you afford
something like this, Ned?

I get your mail once in a while,

and you make only $27 a week
more than I do.

19
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,396
It's simple, Simpson.
Credit.

20
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,943
Ooh, credit!

21
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,211
Thank you, God.

We're just browsing.
Thank you.

I'd like to see your finest RV.

25
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,898
Do you have something that's
better than the Land Behemoth?

26
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:55,131
Yes, we do. That would be
the Ultimate Behemoth.

27
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:58,636
- Where is it?
- You are standing in its presence.

28
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,560
- Behold!
- Wow!

29
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:05,309
Would you look at this thing?
Can you... Man built this. It's a vehicle.

30
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,313
Does it have
its own satellite dish, sir?

31
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:11,565
You can tell your son
it has its own satellite.

32
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:15,359
The VanStar One, launched last February...
Just for this thing, that's all.

33
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,315
- Whoa, man!
- I'm not sure that we can afford...

34
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,866
- Does it have a deep fryer?
- It has four of them...

35
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,950
One for each part
of the chicken.

36
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,786
I don't think
we can afford this, Homer.

37
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,501
Let's worry about that later.

38
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,791
Come on. Let's take a tour.
Want to? Come on!

39
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,922
- Ay, caramba.
- This is better than our house.

40
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,006
Wait till Flanders
gets a load of this.

41
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,971
Seems so expensive.

42
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,143
Hey!

43
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,523
How much is it?

44
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,679
You're a man of your convict...

45
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,228
You just wanted to ask that
and blurted it out, didn't ya?

46
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,812
- Yeah. How much is it?
- Well,

47
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,898
first of all, I want you
to know I like your face.

48
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,074
- You do?
- I really do.

49
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,243
I'm not saying that. I mean it.
You got color in there.

50
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,243
- You're not Roman, are you?
- No!

51
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,405
Look like a god, sort of.

52
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,254
Why don't we step
into the credit office, Zeus?

53
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,290
Hey, your dad's gonna just go in here,

54
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,705
work it out and then
you'll drive home in this!

55
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,304
I'm not gonna quote you
a price till I check your credit rating.

56
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:20,391
And let me... I want to make
myself clear on this. This is a formality.

57
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,048
If you're saying to me,
"Bob, is this guy good for it?"

58
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:27,177
I say, "Yes." I don't check this machine,
but I don't own the place,

59
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,767
even though my name's up there.

60
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,162
Long story, but that
doesn't matter.

61
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,057
I'm gonna have to run it
through the computer.

62
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,691
Is that a good siren?
Am I approved?

63
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,487
You ever known a siren
to be good?

64
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,781
No, Mr. Simpson, it's not.
It's a bad siren.

65
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,366
That's the computer in case
I went blind, telling me,

66
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,292
"Sell the vehicle to this fella,
and you're out of business."

67
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,372
That's what the siren says.

68
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,837
Seems the Ultimate Behemoth
is a wee bit out of your price range.

69
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,629
And "wee bit"
is me bein' polite.

70
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,384
You couldn't afford this thing
if you lived to be a million.

71
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,846
Don't you have something that
isn't out of my price range?

72
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,218
I don't wanna go away
empty-handed, Bob.

73
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,346
Take it easy there. Don't ruin
this feeling I'm gettin' from ya.

74
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,894
Perhaps I can show you
something...

75
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,188
a little more you.

76
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,029
Well, what do you think?

77
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,319
You gotta be kidding me.

78
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,573
- Used, isn't it?
- What'd you say?

79
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,905
Is it used?

80
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,830
Mr. Simpson, you're never
gonna own a better RV.

81
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,929
I don't mean that in a good way.
I mean literally, buddy.

82
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,373
This is it for you, you know?
It's this or a wagon.

83
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,036
Then... how much
do you want for it?

84
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,595
This is yours. The price I'm quoting,
you're not gonna hand it to someone else?

85
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,147
'Cause I'm gonna give you a price for
you. Someone else, I'm doublin' this.

86
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,092
- I swear it, Bob.
- This is you and me.

87
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,764
- Yeah.
- Two months from now,

88
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,142
your head's in that window.

89
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,258
- On my honor.
- 350 a month.

90
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,256
Well, I don't know.

91
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,808
Would it be all right
if I conferred with my family?

92
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,312
Mr. Simpson, if you have to talk it over
with those humans out there,

93
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,265
there's something wrong
with all of us.

94
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:00,896
You look like a man able to make a
decision. See that man over there?

95
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,105
- Yeah.
- He's buying this. Did you know that?

96
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:07,196
Called me, said, "Save the little one.
I'm coming." Here he is.

97
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,203
- Now you want it or not?
- All right, all right. I'll take it!

98
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:14,206
Best decision you'll ever... You are
gonna... This is gonna change your life.

99
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:23,045
Hey, Flanders.
Look what I got.

100
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,392
She's a beaut!
Hey, congratulations!

Jealous. Everybody ready?

103
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,848
I hate this.
I don't wanna go.

104
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,515
That's the spirit.
Ready or not, nature,

105
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,614
here we come!

106

- This is not the interstate.
- Maps.

114

Shouldn't we stop somewhere
and ask for directions?

115
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,732
Don't worry.
This is an all-terrain vehicle.

154
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,113
I don't think they'll be gone

- It's a deal.

Back to civilization.

- How do you know?
- When you're an experienced woodsman like me,

166
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,952
you get a feel for these things.

00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,544
It becomes natural,
like a third sense.

168
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,505
♪♪

169
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,516
The boys certainly
are taking a long time.

170
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,730
I hope Maggie isn't
slowing them up too much.

171
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,709
Bart! Where are you, Bart?

172
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:54,093
His lucky red hat.
Dear God!

173
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,381
No! Bart!

174
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,835
Bart! Bart!

175
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:08,104
Bart!
Bart, my beautiful son!

176
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,185
Why couldn't You have taken me?

177
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,481
Of all the fates
on heaven and earth,

178
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,145
why did this one befall me?

179
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:19,204
Don't have a cow, Dad.

180
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,200
What the... D!

181
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,452
You're alive! And buck naked.

182
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,495
I'm not the only one, Home boy.

183
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,499
What?

184
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,462
Jungle man.

185
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,766
The first thing you learn about
surviving in the woods, boy:

186
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,943
conceal your nakedness.

187
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:56,111
- Yeah, man.
- Okay. Slap a fern on there, boy.

188
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,442
And now with some mud.

189
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,447
There. Ooh!

190
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,489
That requires a little moss.

191
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,913
And some moss for me.
All right.

192
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:09,503
- We're ready to hit the town.
- But, Dad, I am so hungry!

193
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,330
Can't we eat somethin' first?
I'm starvin', man.

194
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,666
Food.
Good thinking, son.

195
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,512
This young sapling
ought to do the trick.

196
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,014
- What are we gonna do, hang ourselves?
- No!

197
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,313
This is a trap. It's gonna catch us
our dinner. Come on, boy.

198
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:29,348
Shh! Just watch.

199
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,265
Oooh!

200
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,475
A-ha! Got him!

201
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,567
Okay, okay.

202
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,485
This time I'll just
go into the bushes over there,

203
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,334
make a lot of noise
and flush out a rabbit.

204
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,660
And when he comes out,
you step on him.

205
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,156
Right, Dad.

206
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,500
Get 'em off me!

207
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,795
Get 'em off me!
Get 'em off me!

208
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,258
Great camping trip, honey.
Traveled 800 miles,

209
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,347
haven't even seen a squirrel yet.

210
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,952
Well, the ranger at the gate said
we should watch out for bears.

211
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,098
Bears!

212
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,187
Right, right. Let me show you how
many bears there are around here.

213
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,074
Hello, bears!

214
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,651
Um, come on.
Have a donut.

215
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,907
What the heck, have me!
Come and get it!

216
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,700
All right, all right.
You made your point.

217
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,504
Bears.

218
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:07,622
- I hope Maggie and the boys are all right.
- I'm sure they're just fine.

219
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:11,618
After all, we built a fire, and we
don't know anything about nature.

220
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,162
Imagine what your father,
an experienced woodsman, has done.

221
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,377
Yeah, I suppose so.
Good night, Mom.

222
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,344
Good night, dear.

223
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:28,644
G-G-Good n-n-night, D-D-Dad.

224
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,469
G-G-Good n-n-night, son.

225
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,475
Sleep tight.

226
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,407
- Are we there yet?
- No!

227
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,503
- Are we ever gonna be there?
- How would I know?

228
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,458
Quit asking pointless...

229
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,749
Bart, look!

230
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,173
Honey. Honey!

231
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:06,012
- We're saved!
- Homer. Bees?

232
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,929
- How is it?
- Tangy.

233
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,733
What?

234
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,731
Water. That-a-way, man.

235
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:49,344
Bigfoot. The legendary half-man half-ape
is no longer a legend.

236
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,795
He's very, very real. What you're
about to see is unedited video footage

237
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:56,766
taken earlier today in the hills three
miles southwest of Tenderfoot Gorge.

238
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,902
Now, the naturalist who took these
absolutely extraordinary pictures

239
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,614
was most impressed
by the creature's uncivilized look,

240
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:14,065
its foul language and, most of all,
its indescribable stench.

241
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,408
A popular supermarket tabloid

242
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,702
has offered a reward of $5,000

243
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,156
to anyone who brings in
the creature alive.

244
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,917
Naturally, we'll have more on this
story as soon as it develops.

245
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,560
We now return you to the president's
address already in progress.

246
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:45,022
It looks as if you girls have
been getting along all right,

247
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,775
but it's a darn good thing
we found you when we did.

248
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,358
There's something horrible
roaming these woods.

249
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,654
There is?

250
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,485
Why, that's my husband!

251
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,998
His name isn't Bigfoot.
His name is Homer.

252
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,876
- What does it eat?
- I don't understand.

253
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,295
What's this all about?

254
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:17,053
Well, I suppose pork chops
are his favorite.

255
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,647
Get those bears out of here.
I'm trying to do an interview.

256
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,650
No bears!
We're taping!

257
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,732
All bears off the set.

258
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,406
Okay. Now let's get back
to your, husband.

259
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,411
How would you describe
your marital relations? Brutish?

260
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,294
- Is this going to be on TV?
- Coast to coast.

261
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,286
- Just a little further.
- Are we there? Are we there?

262
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,497
- Just a little further.
- Are we there? Are we there?

263
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:54,006
Food!

264
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,442
Nice grizzlies.

265
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,729
N-Nice grizzlies.
Nice grizzlies.

266
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,194
- What do we do, Dad?
- Praise the grizzlies, son.

267
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,605
Nice grizzlies.

268
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,364
That's a good grizzly.

269
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,543
Maggie!

270
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,251
My little girl.

271
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,002
Nice grizzlies.
Nice grizzlies.

272
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,795
Later, grizzly dudes.

273
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,864
Look! It's him!
It's Bigfoot!

274
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,230
Get in the car!

275
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,398
Get him! Get him!

276
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,816
We got him! We got Bigfoot!

277
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,576
You are darn lucky we got here
in time to rescue you.

278
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,448
What the hell
are you talking about, sir?

279
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,905
- He's getting away.
- After him!

280
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,746
We gotta take him alive.
You got that tranquilizer gun ready?

281
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,593
Dad! Dad!

282
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:24,767
Avenge me, son.
Avenge my death.

283
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,859
Last week's capture of Bigfoot turned into
the scientific poser of the century.

284
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,670
Although the creature
was ultimately released,

285
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,941
the question remains,

286
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,946
"Who was this Homer?"

287
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,948
Was it a man or was it, in fact,

288
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,950
the legendary missing link
known as Bigfoot?

289
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,032
Could I have some applesauce?

290
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:47,287
Specialists gathered at the
Springfield Primate Institute

291
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,041
for a firsthand examination
of the controversial creature.

292
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,253
They are now ready
to announce their findings.

293
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,754
Ladies and gentlemen,

294
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,706
distinguished colleagues,

295
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,467
after extensive biological
and anatomical testing,

296
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:05,390
I regret to announce that the evidence
we have is... inconclusive.

297
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:08,892
This thing may or may not be human.

298
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,396
That's what he thinks.

299
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,558
I say it's none other
than Bigfoot in the flesh.

300
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,148
No. I disagree. I think it is a man.

301
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,034
The eyes have the glimmer
of human intelligence.

302
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,452
Really. Glimmer in the eyes.

303
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,200
What about the sloping ape-like
forehead?

304
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,242
The guys at work
are gonna have a field day with this.

305
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,576
Cheer up, Homer.
At least they let you go.

306
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,752
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

307
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,920
Fraulein, please.

308
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,629
This much I believe
we can agree upon:

309
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,840
this specimen is either
a below-average human being...

310
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,262
or... a brilliant beast.

311
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:44,221
Stupid egghead.

312
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,933
Homer.

313
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,524
My brilliant beast.

314
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,226
♪♪

315
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,384
Shh!
