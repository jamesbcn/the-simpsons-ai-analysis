{\an8}Oh. Happy anniversary, Marge.

14
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,818
{\an8}Hey, look what was in here!

15
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,164
{\an8}A program from that guy's funeral.

You mean Frank Grimes?

17
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,409
{\an8}Yeah, him. Whatever happened to that guy?

{\an8}-(both grunting)

19
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,369
{\an8}-What are you doing?
-Playing Hot Wheels.

20
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,918
{\an8}Ow! That had a guide pin in it.

21
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:29,512
{\an8}What happened to Grampa?
He was supposed to babysit.

{\an8}Now you got her, Bart. Jump Lisa's king.

{\an8}I'm not Bart. I'm Rod Flanders.

{\an8}There you go with that smart mouth!

25
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,143
{\an8}Lisa, run outside and cut me a switch.

26
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,136
{\an8}Yes, sir!

27
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,108
{\an8}I'll guess we'll have to take
the kids with us to dinner.

-But, Marge...

Hey, Jose, easy up, huh?

44
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,863
Sorry. We were only hired to park cars.

45
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:39,947
-Wow! This is the best anniversary ever!

47
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:57,683
Well, maybe our next anniversary
will be more romantic.

48
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:03,345
{\an8}Aw, look, Homie, our wedding cake.

49
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,893
{\an8}You mean there's been cake
in our freezer for 11 years?

50
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,307
Why was I not informed?

51
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,895
MARGE: Look at this little plastic couple.

52
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,361
Hmm, so full of hopes,

53
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:16,072
{\an8}potential, dreams for the future.

54
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:20,704
{\an8}Hey, Marge, wouldn't it be weird if they
had little parties at night?

55
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:23,333
{\an8}Wee little parties?

56
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,121
{\an8}I'm going to bed.

57
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,170
{\an8}Gotcha! Oh.

58
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,380
(yawns) Another super year
with a super lady. Good night, honey.

59
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,764
Good night, Homie.

60
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,925
You know, uh, it is a special occasion.

61
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,814
Yeah. We probably should...

62
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,103
you know, "rock the casbah."

63
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,728
Yeah, it seems like the thing to do.

64
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:57,736
-So, are you gonna--
-Oh. Did you want me to?

65
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,860
Oh, no. No, I'm the guy. I'm supposed to-

66
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,368
No, no, no. I have my part in this, too.

67
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,990
HOMER: I know, but let me
get you started first.

68
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,328
-All right, how's that?
-MARGE: (groaning)

69
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,503
-Homie, you got your elbow in--
-Oh, sorry.

70
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,423
-BOTH: Hmm.
-HOMER: Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

71
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,752
MARGE: Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

72
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,507
-Do you want me to--
-HOMER: No, don't do that.

73
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,469
-MARGE: Well, we used to do--
-I know, but I don't like it. (sighs)

74
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,680
-(sighs)
-(barks)

75
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,102
-Look who's here!
-Ooh, who's a good boy?

76
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:30,102
-He's the best boy!
-Oh, yes, he is! Yes, he is!

00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,646
-(barks)
-(both sigh)

78
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,569
Hey, Marge, wasn't that great
when the dog came in here?

79
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:42,993
-Oh, yeah! He's really special!
-I love that dog.

80
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,124
-I love him, too. Good night.
-Good night.

81
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,452
(whistling)

82
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,828
Whoops! (moaning)

83
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:55,376
Hmm, that's queer. (groans)

84
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,301
Homer, don't look!

85
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,840
What? Aaah! The food!

86
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,840
(whimpering)

87
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:07,637
Why did this happen? Why? (sobbing)

88
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,104
Someone left the freezer door
open and the motor burned out.

89
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:13,064
-We can get a new one.
-OK.

90
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,516
It was just the shock of seeing
all that food on the floor.

91
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,896
Plus, I'd just fallen
on my back, which hurt more than I let on.

92
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,355
MARGE: When we got married,

93
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,276

we'd be spending our Saturdays?

94
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:27,785
Driving out to the boondocks to trade in
a refrigerator motor?

95
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,909

-(tires screeching)
-Oh! Oh, easy!

104
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,979
I'll get us out of this, honey.

105
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,526
It's just gonna take
a whole lot of floorin'.

106
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,490
(engine revving)

107
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:13,536

When are Mom and Dad coming back?

111
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:26,218
Bored, are ya? Lisa, go cut me a switch.

112
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,812
Oh! There's gotta be something
to do around here.

113
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,019
Hey, are they pulling the plug
on anybody today?

114
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,560
Nope, everybody's paid up.

115
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,103
What a weird looking vacuum cleaner.

116
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:40,267
What, are you simple? That's my
old mine detector from the war.

117
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,648
It was my job to clear
the roads of enemy explosives.

118
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,066
(detector beeping)

119
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,169
And that's how I earned the Iron Cross.

120
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,131
-Can we borrow this, Grampa?
-Sure. She still works.

121
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,342
-(beeping)
-That's my brass knee. Steel hip.

122
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,514
-(beeping)
-That one's news to me.

123
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,260
When you think about it,
mud is nothing but wet dirt.

124

(panting) Safe at last.

132
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:38,455
Shh. We're trespassing.
And some of these farmers have pitchforks.

133
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,671
Hey, Teresa, Steve. Now who let you out?

134
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,634
Ah, looks like we got us some intruders.

135
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,548
-(pounding)
-FARMER: Who's in there?

136
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,807
-(both gasp)
-(grunts)

137
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,101
If somebody's in here, you're in for some
serious ass forkin'!

138
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:10,364
Huh. Well, maybe they're
in the media room.

00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:17,038

-Very close.

143
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,846
At your service, milady.

00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:45,691
-<i>Cara mia.</i>
-(laughing)

145
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,605
-Hey, public display!
-Yeah, what's with the love thang?

146
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,525
Let's just say the country air
did us good.

147
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,196
TV AUDIENCE: <i>Whoo!</i>

148
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,865
Bart, I told you not to leave that TV on.

149
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,915
TV AUDIENCE: <i>Whoa-oh!</i>

150
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,673
What are we looking for anyway?

151
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,381
Pirate booty. What else?

152
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,377
Argh! Now we bury the treasure.

153
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:14,346
Uh, Captain? Captain? I know we usually
bury the treasure,

154
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:18,178
but what if this time
we use it to buy things?

155
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,426
You know, things we like.

156
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,938
(grunts)

157
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:28,188
Argh. We'll dig up
the treasure in seven yar.

158
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,026
I've drawn a map on this cracker

159
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,912
which Polly will hold for safekeepin'.

160
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,493
So, you see, there's treasure everywhere.

161
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,038
-(beeping)
-Hmm.

162
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,712
(grunting)

163
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,881
OK, here's the deal. Crowns and doubloons
are mine...

164
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,961
snuff boxes and cameos are yours.

165
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,756
Now, as for wands and scepters--

166
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,760
-It's a bottle cap.
-Jewel-encrusted?

167
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,683
(whistle blowing)

168
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,392
Hey, Homer, see you at Moe's?

169
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,562
He put new electrical tape
on the cushions.

170
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,731
Sorry, guys. Marge and I
are spending the weekend

171
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,270
at a bed-and-breakfast.

172
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,153
Oh, trying to jump-start
the old marriage, huh?

173
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,111
Can I come?

174
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,400
Nah, it'd just be awkward,
what with the sex and all.

175
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:15,105
Yeah, I always figured Marge would be
a dynamo in the sack, you know?

176
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,367
Oh, boy, she's got legs
from here to ya-ya!

177
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,121
(tires screech)

178
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,582
-How do you do, ma'am?
-Hope this evening finds you well.

179
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,134
Oh, knock it off, you perverts.

180
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,918
HOMER: Now they did say
bed and breakfast, right?

181
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,724
Oh, isn't it romantic?

182
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,388
Doilies and cozies as far
as the eye can see.

183
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,929
If there's anything more exquisite

184
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,023
than Queen Anne's lace,
I haven't found it.

185
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:46,309
-Big enough for two.
-(growls)

186
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:50,105
Are you ready to rock? 'Cause here we go.

187
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,486
Should we get started?

188
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,530
Um, eh, no time like the present.

189
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,993
Hmm, something's not right.

190
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,958
Does this bed feel lumpy to you?

191
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,959
Well, yeah, kinda.

192
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,711
Did that butter churn just move?

193
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,295
'Cause if it did--

194
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,010
What's wrong with us, Homer?
Have we lost the spark already?

195
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,683
No, no, honey. Maybe this will help.

196
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:24,353
-Hey! Look at that!
-(door opens)

197
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,063
(gasps) Oh, good Lord!

198
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,353
-(gasps)
-(screams)

199
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,397
I'm so sorry. I saw everything.

200
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,692
(pants) Oh, my heart's beating like crazy.

201
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,907
Mine too! Just like back in that hayloft.

202
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:42,698
You know, the fear of getting caught
is kind of a turn-on.

203
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:46,155
There's that dirty girl I married.

204
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,247
Come on. I have a disgusting idea.

205
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,633
WOMAN: Oh, it's a donkey.

206
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,926
MARGE: Shh. They'll hear us.

207
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,179
HOMER: They didn't hear us
in the sewing room.

208
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,391
(Marge giggling)

209
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,934
Hmm.

210
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,936
-Whoa! Excellent haul!
-But it's all trash.

211
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,770
Exactly. Now there's nothing
left out there but treasure.

212
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,438
Hello, everybody.

213
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,986
Hey, you're back.
Did you "rock the casbah"?

214
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,700
Bart! Yes.

215
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,240
Do you know you have your hands
in each other's pockets?

216
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,454
It's OK when you're in love...

217
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:28,365
and married to
the sweetest guy in the world!

218
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:32,496
-Ahhh. Eskimo kiss!
-(both moaning)

219
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,255
-BOTH: Eww.
-You guys are sick.

220
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,428
You don't think there's anything wrong
with what we're doing, do you?

221
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:43,138
I don't think anything
I've ever done is wrong.

222
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,769
-(shovel bangs object)
-(gasps) This is it, Lise.

223
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,850
The mother lode!

224
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:54,271
(panting, grunts)

225
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,646
(sighs)

226
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,446
{\an8}LISA: Wow! An alternate ending
to <i>Casablanca.</i>

227
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,699
Bart, this could be priceless!

228
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,872
Priceless like a mother's love,
or the good kind of priceless?

229
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,420
Not yet. Wait. Wait. Wait.

230
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Now!

231
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,263
(giggling)

232
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,682
Oh, this is so naughty.

233
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,351
Coming back to our old love nest.

234
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:31,690
It hasn't changed since that
magical evening when I knocked you up.

235
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,859
Oh, we drank so much that night.

236
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:39,029
Yeah. I thought Bart
would be born a dimwit!

237
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,359
(laughing) Yeah.

238
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:46,486
Well, this time I'm drunk on love

239
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,535
and beer.

240
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,456
{\an8}(film projector running)

241
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,581
Here comes "two."

242
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,788
(beeps)

243
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,587
(airplane engine rattling)

244
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,932
Louis, I think this could be
the start of a beautiful friendship.

245
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,179
Look out, Rick! He's packin' heat!

246
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,353
(grunts)

247
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,691
Good work, Sam. Come on.
I'll buy you a falafel.

248
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,558
Not so fast, <i>schmarteneimer!</i>

249
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:21,355
-(explosion)
-Hope you don't mind my dropping in?

250
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,993
Not at all, sweet cakes.
You know what to do, Sam.

251
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,032
(slow melody)

252
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:36,421
-(bell tolling)
-(crowd cheering)

253
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,554
Unbelievable.

254
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,299
I'll say. Wasn't it great?

255
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,381
And the question mark leaves
the door open for a sequel.

256
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:50,057
I've seen that movie 10 times,
and I never get tired of that ending.

257
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:54,139
Aye, aye, aye, where did you get this,
ya shrunken old hag, ya?

258
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,266
-I'm just a little girl.
-(grunts)

259
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,943
My studio produced <i>Casablanca, </i>all right?

260
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:02,443
We tried to tack that happy ending
on the picture, 'cause back then

261
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:08,066
well, studio execs, we were-- we were
just dopes in suits, not like today.

262
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,117
What are you talking about? I loved it.

263
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,700
Ah, you're a sweet old gent to say that.

264
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,576
This should be in a museum.

265
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,753
Look, I'll tell you what.

266
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:20,541
I'll give you 20 bucks
to bury this thing again. This one, too.

267
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,721
Now, the secret
to the windmill hole is to--

268
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,470
-Not hit the blades?
-Bingo.

269
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,517
(Homer gasps)

270
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:40,813
Hmm, that's odd. It didn't come out
the rear end.

271
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:45,108
Rod, you've got small, girlish hands.
Reach in and fish it out.

272
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,657
-A hand!
-(gasps)

273
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,330
Ow! Daddy, something attacked me!

274
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,830
Oh, now, Roddy, it's just a stuck ball.
I'll get it.

275
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,167
Truant ball, eh? (chuckles) I'll help you.

276
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,801
Oh, quit showing off, Seymour.
I'll get it.

277
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,875
There is something in there. Oh!

278
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,087
MRS. KRABAPPEL: Feels like a hefty bag
full of meat.

279
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,927
We're trapped!

280
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:15,312
Oh, why can't they just play through?

281
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,194
ROD: No, Daddy, you stick
your hand in there and see what it is.

282
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,360
Mm, something's in there, all right.

283
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,202
-Maybe it's presents for all of us.
-Well, it could be anything.

284
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,118
-(sniffing) Smells like a bear.
-(all gasp)

285
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,618
Who cares what it is? Let's monoxide it!

286
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,291
Oh, why are people
always trying to kill me?

287
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,160
-We have to get out of here!
-(grunting)

288
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,168
(all gasping)

289
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,340
-(screaming)
-(crashing)

290
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,630
(all coughing and groaning)

291
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,466
(gasps) It was people!

292
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,142
People soiled our green!

293
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:58,021
And now they're out there
somewhere, naked as the day God made them!

294
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,230
Boy, I'll tell ya. (chuckles)
They only come out at night.

295
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,271
Or in this case, uh, the daytime.

296
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,265
You've got to catch them!

297
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:09,397
Think of the children. Won't somebody
please think of the children!

298
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:13,156
All right, all right. Here you go, boy.
Get the scent.

299
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,450
(sniffs)

300
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,623
(whining)

301
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,962
That's a shame. He had one day left
till retirement.

302
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,499
(both panting)

303
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,682
(both panting)

304
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,850
OK, come on!

305
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:42,517
Marge, can we trade?
I don't trust these guys.

306
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,023
We've gotta get home
before someone sees us.

307
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,065
You know, all this danger
is kind of a turn--

308
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,150
-(grunts)
-OK.

309
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,446
(breathing heavily)

310
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:59,239
(gasps) Gill! Thank God it's you!
You gotta help us!

311
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:03,578
Well, that's what I'm here for. I mean,
you're young, successful, you're naked.

312
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,455
You want a car with a radio, right?

313
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:09,512
You kids like music, right,
huh? (imitates music beats)

314
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,838
(siren wailing)

315
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,345
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Don't go! Oh, no, not today.

316
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,888
Not to Gill. I could taste
that sale. I was in the zone.

317
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,773
(brakes screech)

318
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,440
All right, men, those nudies
are here somewhere. Fan out!

319
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,864
Oh, we're surrounded, Marge.
Maybe we should give ourselves up.

320
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,236
But think of the scandal.

321
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,452
Yeah, the British tabloids
will have a field day.

322
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,954
There's only one thing left to do.

323
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,575
Grab on to the handles, Marge!

324
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,872
-Got 'em.
-(grunts)

325
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:49,344
Ah, they stole the balloon!
I've been living in there!

326
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,629
Well, just, you know,
just till things pick up.

327
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,593
(laughs nervously)

328
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:56,723
Oh, Lord, my hot plate.
I only had two payments left.

329
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,303
HOMER: OK, I think
I figured this thing out.

330
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,928
-(flame searing)
-You go up and down,

331
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,934
but not side to side, or back in time.

332
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:06,306
(gasps) Clothes! We're saved!

333
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,822
-Oh, these have pleats.
-Just grab 'em!

334
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:14,318
(gasps) I'm OK, honey.
Now listen very carefully.

335
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,783
I want you to pull on the thing

336
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,525
that's near the other thing.

337
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:23,747
-MARGE: You mean this thing?
-(screams)

338
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,999
No, that was not the thing. (groans)

339
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,091
-(church organ playing)
-Now, let us thank the Lord

340
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,630
for this magnificent Crystal Cathedral

341
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,094
which allows us to look out

342
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,175
upon his wondrous creation.

343
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,311
-(flesh screeching window)
-(congregation gasps)

344
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:47,019
Now quickly! Gaze down at God's
fabulous parquet floor.

345
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,772
Eyes on the floor. Still on the floor.

346
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,315
-HOMER: Oh, my ass!
-Always on God's floor.

347
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,450
(moaning)

348
00:19:56,528 --> 00:20:00,568
Hang on, Homie! I'm gonna
try to set her down!

349
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,577
Thank you.

350
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:05,038
Wow! A lot of people have pools.

351
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,210
Honey, my shoulders are separating!

352
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,379
OK, OK, here we go.

353
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,669
(cheering)

354
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,888
Dear Lord, look at that blimp!
He's hanging from a balloon!

355
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,509
Marge, uh, can we not land here?

356
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,767
Honey? Baby doll?

357
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,519
(players grunting)

358
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,523
-(groans)
-ANNOUNCER: <i>No good!</i>

359
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,984
(booing)

360
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,614
Don't blame me!

361
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,030
(both grunt)

362
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,236
-(crowd gasping)
-MAN: That's hideous!

363
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,951
Why don't you take a picture?
It lasts longer!

364
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,243
-(camera shutters clicking)
-D'oh!

365
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,957
It would have to be camera day.

366
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,538
(cheering and whistling)

367
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,260
-Wow!
-Hey!

368
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,508
I don't want you reading
those awful scandal sheets.

369
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,511
Uh, I was just trying to find
Dave Barry's column.

370
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,264
He's great. He pokes fun
at life's little foibles.

371
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,183
Kids, I want to explain about the stadium.

372
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,098
You see, sometimes moms and dads

373
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:15,567
get a little, well,
accustomed to each other.

374
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:19,439
-Dads especially.
-So they need to explore new ways...

375
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,608
to express their love.

376
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:26,287
Scary ways. But we never
intended it to end like that

377
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:30,618
with thousands of people
staring at our naked bodies.

378
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:34,576
All those eyes just leering
and leering at us.

379
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:40,548
-Who's in the mood for miniature golf?
-Ooh, I am!

380
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:44,552
(both cheering)

381
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:54,154
{\an8}Huh. They're gonna feel
so silly when they realize they forgot us.
