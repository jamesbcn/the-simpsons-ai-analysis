178
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,633
Why is your voice different
when you sing?

179
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,803
It is because of all the years
I spent at the Kwik-E-Mart...

180
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,223
(rock song playing)

181
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,221
<i>...where classic rock anthems</i>
<i>were piped in</i>

182
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,763
<i>on a never-ending loop.</i>

183
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,306
<i>The endless repetition</i>
<i>drove many clerks to madness.</i>

184
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,729
<i>The only way to maintain my sanity</i>

185
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:44,481
<i>was to sing along until</i>
<i>it seemed like our voices were one.</i>

186
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:48,275
<i>♪ Hopin' for a dream ♪</i>

187
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,861
<i>-♪ Hopin' ♪</i>
<i>-♪ Focus like a laser beam ♪</i>

188
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,618
<i>♪ I'll keep fighting</i>
<i>till I want something great ♪</i>

189
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,541
<i>♪ Hopin' for a dream ♪</i>

190
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,001
(song ends)

191
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,001
Guys, are you feeling this?
Are you feeling this?

192
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,554
-I'm feeling it.
-I'm definitely feeling it.

193
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,548
I felt something earlier,
but I was afraid to bring it up.

194
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,511
I think we all felt something.

195
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,391
We are more than just a garage band

196
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,008
desperate to do anything other
than hang out with our families.

197
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,516
We are now a cover band.

198
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,388
And we shall be called... Covercraft.

199
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:24,016
Because we play covers
and this is our craft.

200
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:27,275
-And it sounds like Hovercraft.
-That was not my intent.

201
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,528
Okay, Covercraft, hands in.

202
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,030
-Cover...
-ALL: Craft!

203
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:41,162
R-O-K-C.

204
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,790
(carnival music playing)

205
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,298
(instruments tuning)

206
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,097
Okay, this crowd is about to experience

207
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,219
the special magic of the cover band,

208
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,137
the thrill of live music

209
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,845
without the fear
of hearing anything new.

210
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,726
-Hmm?
-(sighs)

211
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,613
Apu, what's wrong?

212
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,480
What if-- What if I am no good?

213
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,647
This is the Cabbage Festival, man.

214
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,986
I-I don't know if I can face that crowd!

215
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,321
(groans)

216
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,486
Buddy, buddy.
Think of it this way--

217
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,825
you're not singing
in front of all those people,

218
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,160
you're alone at the Kwik-E-Mart
in the middle of the night.

219
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:27,127
You just wear this onstage,
and everything will be fine.

220
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,919
(gasps) My uniform!

221
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,508
All alone at the Kwik-E-Mart.

222
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,970
<i>♪ ♪</i>

223
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,017

Everyone loves you, Dad.

232
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,722
You could become a famous rock star!

233
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,313
Well, son, I do have the talent.

234
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,139
My mind is full of ideas

235
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,274
for great songs I could write...

236
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,811
down the names of and then cover.

237
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,515
But then I remember--

238
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,145
I'm just a regular guy,
jamming with my buds.

239
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,533
Oh, sweetie.

240
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,109
This band has brought out
the best in you.

241
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,315
Yeah, you really get that
it's all about the music.

242
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,777
Yep. t's all about the music.

243
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:46,077
And it would take a pretty unforeseen
development to change that.

244
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:49,293
Pretty unforeseen...

245
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,798
Gentlemen, I think we've found
what we're looking for.

246
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,603
HOMER:
Guys, I really need your honesty here.

247
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,559
At the Squidport Senior Jamboree...

248
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,099
was I too in the pocket?

249
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,773
(Covercraft members gasp)

250
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,902
KIRK:
Freddy Freeman, Shredder Stevens,

251
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,769
Nick Delacourt, and Peter D'Abbruzio--

252
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:16,187
you're four of the five guys
from Sungazer!

253
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,357
But where's your lead singer,
Grant LeDavid?

254
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,947
Uh, he passed away.

255
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,371
-How?
-(whispers)

256
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,751
What kind of erotic asphyxiation?

257
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,958
-(whispers)
-Oh...

258
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,331
Apu, you're the only man
on the entire Internet

259
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,037
who's got the pure Sungazer sound.

260
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,628
Will you be our new lead singer
and join us on our stadium tour?

261
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,375
ALL: Ooh!

262
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,257
I think I can answer for Apu.

263
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,313
He's flattered,
but the small-time success of Covercraft

264
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,388
is all that any of us have ever wanted.

265
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,854
Uh, actually, I...

266
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,813
Apu has a rich life here in Springfield--

267
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,685
a store full of great products,

268
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,572
a lovely him-type wife,

269
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,318
and eight super kids--

270
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,570
Anoop, Sandeep, Nabendu, Gheet,

271
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,913
Pria, Uma, Poonam, Sashi...

272
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,950
Shut your mouth.
I want to do it! I want to do it!

273
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,664
I want to be a singer
for a real rock band!

274
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,905
-SHREDDER STEVENS: Sun...
-ALL: ...gazer!

275
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Gotta say, I'm kind of jealous of Apu
getting a break like that.

276
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,207
Not me.

277
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,757
I'm nothing but happy

278
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,430
that our friend is headed
for fame and fortune.

279
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,930
APU: Tonight we play Las Vegas--

280
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,472
and the theme of the casino is circus!

281
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,187
Circus! Ha!

282
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,688
(whimpers)
I want his fame and fortune so much!

283
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:38,192
Why must the Lords of Rock
be so cruel?!

284
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,855
(laughing)

285
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,605
Sammy Hagar? You're not dead.

286
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,704
Damn it! I told you those
jalapeño poppers had too much breading!

287
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,246
Sorry, Señor Hagar.

288
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,909
Nah, nah, nah, it's cool, man.

289
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,367
I went to rock star heaven.

290
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:57,587
And there was this great back patio
with this sweet fire pit.

291
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,380
If you had the right wristband--
which I did.

292
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,974
(laughs)

293
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,142
News story in aisle three?

294
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,311
Local clerk,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,

295
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,891
<i>is a dead ringer for a dead singer.</i>

296
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,097
<i>He's living the rock star dream</i>

297
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,897
<i>as front man for</i>
<i>'80s chart-toppers Sungazer</i>

298
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,902
<i>on their Last Final Hell Re-Freezes Over</i>

299
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,315
<i>Ultimate Good-bye For Serious This Time</i>

300
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,204
Never Again
Part Two of Question Mark Tour.

301
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,582
Apu and the band appeared
on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>

302
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,369
<i>as the punch line</i>
<i>in a game show sketch.</i>

303
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,502
-What's a game show?
-Something you make sketches about.

304
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,171
<i>KENT BROCKMAN:</i>
<i>It looks like Apu won't be playing</i>

305
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,169
the Cabbage Festival ever again.

306
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,127
Dad, you shouldn't be jealous of Apu.

307
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,375
Remember, it's all about the music.

308
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,757
I'm not jealous. I'm envious.

309
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,465
Jealousy is when you worry
someone will take what you have.

310
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,596
Envy is wanting
what someone else has.

311
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,893
What I feel is envy.

312
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,267
Hmm.

313
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,693
-Wow, he's right.
-You know what?

314
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,822
Apu leaving is the best thing
that ever happened to this band.

315
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,651
We're gonna be like Genesis
after Peter Gabriel left.

316
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,948
You mean more popular
but not as good?

317
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,582
Phil Collins-era Genesis
is not as good, huh?

318
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,909
"No Reply at All,"
"Land of Confusion,"

319
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,075
"Throwing it All Away,"
"Illegal Alien,"

320
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,674
"I Can't Dance,"
and I'm sure I don't need to mention...

321
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,051
"Invisible Touch"!

322
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,248
Hmph!

323
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,260
(Covercraft playing)

324
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,257
(grunts)

325
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,935
You know, we really could use
a new lead singer.

326
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,268
You know,
I've been known to sing a little.

327
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,024
What? So you can also
get famous and bail on us?

328
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,186
You're out of the band!

329
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,324
Well, you can't just kick him out.

330
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,571
Oh, so you're sticking up
for Yoko here?

331
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,365
Looks like I've got another Yoko
on my hands.

332
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,029
How can there be two Yokos?

333
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,197
Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Yoko!

334
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,707
All you Yokos are out of the band!

335
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,750
(grumbling)

336
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,551
-Are you okay?
-Do I sound okay?

337
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,094
You sound great!

338
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:13,217
Your licks are really... juicy.

339
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,305
They're not juicy. My licks are dry.

340
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,231
Dry and scratchy like a cat's tongue.

341
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:21,149
You didn't join a band to
become famous like in <i>Almost Famous.</i>

342
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,150
You loved playing music
with your friends.

343
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,902
That was enough to make you happy.

344
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,824
Well, it's not enough anymore.

345
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,992
When something great happens
to one person,

346
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,121
everyone else's life gets a little worse.

347
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,078
Look it up, it's called physics.

348
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,738
Apu is a good man.

349
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,997
He sent over front row tickets
and backstage passes

350
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,420
to his show at the Costington Center.

351
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,749
Oh, you mean he generously invited us

352
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,665
to come watch him be a rock star?

353
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,963
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

354
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,167
Your friend had a wonderful thing
happen to him,

355
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,428
and you are coming with us
to share in his talent.

356
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,391
I'll never have a per diem.

357
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,311
You don't know what a per diem is.

358
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,600
Still want one.

359
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,145
Hmph.

360
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,196
Hmph.

361
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,366
Hmph.

362
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,371
Apu wouldn't be able to sing a note

363
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,615
if I didn't help him
get over his stage fright

364
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,497
with his Kwik-E-Mart shirt.

365
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,094
(gasps) Backstage pass,

366
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,590
you just became a payback rage pass.

367
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,188
Look at all this rock star
dressing room stuff.

368
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,599
What a sellout.

369
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,857
Cheese plate...

370
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,268
Oh, sorry, cubed cheese plate.

371
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:51,107
Lemon tea, probably for his throat.

372
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,605
Mm-hmm!

373
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,491
Let's see how he performs
in front of all those people

374
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,535
without his magic-people-
performing-in-front-of shirt.

375
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,214
-(door opens)
-(gasps)

376
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,419
But, Mr. Shredder, you promised me

377
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,040
after we played my hometown
I could have a day off.

378
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,997
I also promised I'd kick heroin.

379
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,208
Hmm?

380
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,547
But the tour is so hard on my family.

381
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,723
My octuplets are being raised
by roadies and bodyguards.

382
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,893
This is not proper.

383
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,141
Look, Apu,
for 25 years we wasted money

384
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,805
on women, drugs,

385
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,153
and guitars with live fish inside.

386
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,359
And now we want to keep it going.

387
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,689
You signed a contract for a three-year,

388
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,395
57-country tour at union scale--

389
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,066
no per diem.

390
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,744
-(gasps softly)
-You're in the band.

391
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,410
Oh, well, I guess it's show time.

392
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,671
-(gasps) Homer?
-I'm sorry, Apu.

393
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,328
I thought you were living
your dream life,

394
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,246
so naturally I wanted to ruin it.

395
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,375
But now I know things stink,

396
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,342
so I'm okay with it.

397
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,762
Oh, what is the point?

398
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,801
I am trapped like a Kwik-E-Mart
hot dog on a roller.

399
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,505
Kwik-E-Mart hot dog, eh?

400
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,766
You want every hot dog in the store?

401
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,229
Every one? Okay...

402
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,661
ALL: Yeah!

403
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,908

Uh, people, I am sorry to report

408
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,554
that all the original members of the band

409
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,009
have been struck down

410
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,759
by a mysterious case
of hot dog poisoning.

411
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,602
-(groaning)
-Rather than refund your money

412
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,018
or reschedule the show,
we have a surprise for you.

413
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,308
Get ready to rock with a group

414
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:49,152

{\an8}So there I am, on Easter Island,

436
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,419
{\an8}and the heads ask me
to play them a song.

437
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,375
{\an8}I say, "Why me, heads?

438
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,875
{\an8}You've heard the music
of the universe itself."

439
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:04,468
{\an8}And they say, "Sammy,
your stuff rocks just a little harder."

440
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,014
{\an8}That's when I wake up.

441
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,388
{\an8}I'm in the Springfield Elementary
parking lot,

442
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,895
{\an8}doing a buck fifty-five
in my Ferrari 512 Boxer.

443
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,859
{\an8}I was cornering so hard,
I blacked out from the Gs, man.

444
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,280
{\an8}They say I ran over the groundskeeper.

445
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,859
{\an8}Probably get life in prison.

446
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,664
{\an8}But I got a plan to escape,
using only this harmonica

447
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,868
{\an8}and some guitar picks
with my face on 'em.

448
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,949
{\an8}Who's with me on this?

449
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,116
