the murderous glint

62

and his breath reeked
of beer and pretzeled bread.

This was all my fault.

To make up for my
failure last night

73
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,914
I've alphabetized
your breakfast.

You can start
with the waffles

75
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:27,674
and work your way
up to the Zwieback,

76
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,709
and to prevent
newsprint

77
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,131
from rubbing off
on your hands

78
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,130
I've laminated
today's newspaper.

79
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,462
I appreciate the thought

80
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,876
but my pen
won't write on this.

81
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,724
How am I supposed to do
the Junior Jumble?

82
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,346
Oh! I can't
even grovel properly.

83
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,889

of a long vacation.

90
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,736
No! Don't make me
take a vacation!

91
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,241
Without you,
I'll wither and die!

92
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,244
That's a risk
I'm willing to take.

93
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,946
But what would you
do without me, Sir?

94
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,286
(scoffs)
I'm not a baby

95
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,411

to burp me.

00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,418

97
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,539
You see?

98
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,085
Now, I insist
you take a vacation

99
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,458
just as soon as

100
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,554
a temporary substitute
can be found.

101
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,010
Yeesh!

102
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,885
I've got to find a replacement
who won't outshine me.

103
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,182
Perhaps if I search
the employee evaluations

104
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,096
for the word "incompetent."

105
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,225
-(beeps)
-714 names?

106
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,232
Better be more specific.

107
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,074
"Lazy," "clumsy,"

108
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,990
"dim-witted,"

109
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,409
"monstrously ugly."

110
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,155
Aw, nuts to this.

111
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,331
I'll just go
get Homer Simpson.

112
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,293
HOMER:
I think Smithers picked me

113
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,830
because of
my motivational skills.

114
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,333
Everyone always says

115
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,035
they have to work a lot
harder when I'm around.

116
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,785
You know, Dad,
assisting Mr. Burns

117
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,706
could give your career
a real shot in the arm.

118
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,545
You know, Homer,
assisting Mr. Burns

119
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,670
could give your career
a real shot in the arm.

120
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,547
Mom, I just
said that.

121
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,224
Sor-ry!

122
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,763
Next time, get
your own darned corn.

123
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,097
{\an8}Um, is this the chair
I'll be sitting on?

124
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,312
Yeah.

125
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,482
Now, I realize
caring for Mr. Burns

126
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,020
seems like a big job

127
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,273
but actually,
it's 2,800 small jobs.

128
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,185
Uh-huh, but this is
the chair, right?

129
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,824
Your new duties will include
answering Mr. Burns' phone

130
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,201
preparing his tax return,
moistening his eyeballs,

131
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,859
assisting with his chewing
and swallowing,

132
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,067
lying to congress
and some light typing.

133
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,278
(phone ringing)

134
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,327
Montgomery Burns'
office.

135
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,790
Oh, hello, Mrs. Burns.

136
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,540
I'll see if your son
is available.

137
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,171
Mr. Burns
has a mother?!

138
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,378
She must be a hundred
million years old!

139
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,209
She has limited
capacities.

140
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,844
All she can do
is dial and yell.

141
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,340
I'm sorry.

142
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,382
Monty can't come
to the phone right now.

143
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,086
He's in a very
important meeting

144
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,586
and can't be disturbed.

145
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,348
Uh-huh.

146
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,023
Okay, I'll give him
the message.

147
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,151
Mr. Burns can't stand
talking to his mother.

148
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,608
He never forgave her

149
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,818
for having that affair
with President Taft.

150
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,189
(chuckling)

151
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,105
Taft, you old dog.

152
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,026
Really, Smithers.

153
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,664
I'll be fine.

154
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,951
I'm sure your replacement

155
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,834
will be able
to handle everything.

156
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,161
Who is he anyway?

157
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,455
Uh, Homer Simpson, Sir.

158
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,578
One of your organ banks
from sector 7G.

159
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,875
All the recent events
of your life

160
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,299
have revolved
around him in some way.

161
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,049
Simpson, eh?

162
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,590
HOMER: Uh, Mr. Smithers?

163
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,344
I don't understand
2,700 of my new duties.

164
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,887
Well, the van's leaving.

165
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,510
Which one duty is giving you
the most trouble?

166
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,217
Um...

167
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,427
What do I do in case of fire?

168
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,518
(muffled)
Sorry. Can't hear you. Bye!

169
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,237
(crackling)

170
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,028

00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,327
(panting)

172
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,503
(gasping)
Good Lord, Smithers,

173
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,750
you look atrocious!

174
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,332
I thought I told you
to take a vacation.

175
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,167
Uh, Smithers
already left, Sir.

176
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,302
I'm his replacement,
Homer Simpson.

177
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,959
Ah, yes, Simpson.

178
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,757
I'll have my lunch now.

179
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,181
A single pillow
of shredded wheat

180
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,220
some steamed toast,
and a dodo egg.

181
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,433
But I think
the dodo went extinct.

182
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,473
Get going!
And answer those phones,

183
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,847
install the computer system,
and rotate my office

184
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,144
so the window
faces the hills.

185
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,897
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Okay.

186
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,401
Um, can you repeat
the part of the stuff

187
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,703
where you said
all about the things?

188
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,278
Uh, the things?

189
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,993
(quiet snarl)

190
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,502
(alarm buzzes)

191
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,674
(grunting)

192
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,960
Lousy two-legged pants.

193
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,714
{\an8}Homie, it's 4:30
in the morning.

194
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,467
{\an8}Little Rascals
isn't on till 6:00.

195
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,049
I know.
I'm taping it.

196
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,394
I want to get to
Mr. Burns' house

197
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,799
bright and early
to make his breakfast.

198
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,217
Mm, poor Homie.

199
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,426
Poor, poor...

200
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,635
(snoring)

201
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,896
Hmm...

202
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,074
One of these must be
a breakfast-maker.

203
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,573
Well, it's my job
to cook him breakfast

204
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,776
and I'm gonna cook
the best damn breakfast

205
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,077
he ever ate.

206
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,248
Hmm...

207
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,416
Hmm...

208
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,301
(groans)

209
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,729
Doughnuts?

210
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,348
I told you
I don't like ethnic food!

211
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,356
Here. Tell me
how my stocks did yesterday.

212
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,768
Uh...

213
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,227
They all won.

214
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,857
Hm?
What about my options?

215
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,784
Well, you can either get up
or go back to sleep.

216
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,532
I believe I'll get up.

217
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,954
(brush scrubbing)

218
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,372
BURNS: Scrub harder.

219
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,450
Got to get that layer
of dead skin off.

220
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,535
HOMER: Ugh.

221
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,747
I think...
the fangs today.

222
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,798
BURNS: Simpson?

223
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,053
Simpson?

224
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,392
Did you get
that report

225
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,601
on the accounting
department?

226
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,271
Yes Sir, I did.

227
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,849
"The accounting department
is located on the third floor.

228
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,395
"Its hours are 9:00 a.m.
to 5:00 p.m.

229
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:27,229
The head of this department
is a Mr. Johnson or Johnstone."

230
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,068
Here are your messages.

231
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,202
"You have 30 minutes
to move your car."

232
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,700
"You have ten minutes."

233
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,741
"Your car
has been impounded."

234
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,075
"Your car has been
crushed into a cube."

235
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,830
"You have 30 minutes
to move your cube."

236
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,042
(phone rings)

237
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,042
Yeah-lo,
Mr. Burns' office.

238
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,673
Is it about my cube?

239
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,789
It's Mr. Smithers.
He's calling for you.

240
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,456
How's everything going there,
Sir?

241
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,125
I have a lot of free time
on my hands.

242
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,594
If you Fed-Ex me your mail,

243
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,554
I'd be happy to open it
and return it to you.

244
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,344
Everything's fine, Smithers.

245
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,348
This Simpson fellow seems to be
getting dumber by the minute.

246
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,561
I've never seen anything
quite like it.

247
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,680
Anyhoo, you just
enjoy your vacation.

248
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,437
(groans)

249
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,309
(snoring)

250
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,647
Look alive,
Simpson!

251
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,442
I'm not paying you
to goldbrick!

252
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,775
Yes! Yes, Sir...

253
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,190
Now get cracking
on my long division

254
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,648
and don't forget to
show your work, Simpson.

255
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,198
I'll have it on your desk
in the morning, Sir.

256
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,071
Bart, leave
Simpson alone.

257
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,038
(whispering)
Simpson, I need a ride to the library.

258
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,079
Kids, stop exploiting
your father.

259
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,793
Homie, why don't you
lie down and relax?

260
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,464
No time, Marge.

261
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,962
I think Mr. Burns wants me
to do some long division.

262
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,625
Simpson! Lie down!

263
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,843
Sorry, but you need
a good night's rest.

264
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:34,974
(sighing)

265
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,341
(bell clanging)

266
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,887
BURNS: Simpson!

267
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,767
(bell tinkling)

268
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,310
(panting)

269
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,603
The telephone's been ringing
for some time.

270
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,727
Answer it.

271
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:49,936
Yello?

272
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,324
It's for you.

273
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,361
<i>♪ Relax... ♪</i>

274
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,864
Mr. Burns-- 48 rings.

275
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:55,945
Are you all right?

276
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,320
What did Simpson do to you?

277
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,156
Oh, nothing other than drive me
to distraction

278
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,581
with his incompetent boobery.

279
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,500
Terrible at everything.
A complete moron!

280
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,909
(whispering)
But I'm not really free

281
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,577
to talk right now.

282
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,586
Now look, stop calling me and
start enjoying your vacation.

283
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,799
Remember, I want to see
lots of pictures

284
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,879
when you get back.

285
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,973
Actually, sir, picture-taking

286
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,089
is not allowed
at this particular resort.

287
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,546
Oop. I got to go now.

288
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,056
There's a line
forming behind me.

289
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,890
(shuddering)

290
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,230
(yelps)

291
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,523
60 watts!

292
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,526
What do you think this is?
A tanning salon?

293
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,318
I asked for light starch
on my night cap.

294
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,453
(yelling)

295
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,120
You call this Postum?

296
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,618
You call this
a tax return?

297
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,871
You call this
a super computer?

298
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,623
-(grunting)
-D'oh! Ow!

299
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,037
(yelling) You're a travesty
of a joke of an assistant!

300
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,836
(whimpering)

301
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,129
(yelling)

302
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,263
(clock ticking)

303
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,312
(whimpering)

304
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,521
(shrieks)

305
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,101
(gasping)

306
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,397
Is there something
wrong, Homie?

307
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,151
No.

308
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,653
Except?

309
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,275
Except...

310
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,361
I killed Mr. Burns!

311
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,117
What happened, Dad?

312
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,618
I punched Burns right in his
104-year-old face.

313
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,991
Are you sure he's dead?

314
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,287
Maybe you just really,
really hurt him.

315
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,370
Okay. Maybe
everything's all right.

316
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,707
Maybe if you go apologize,
he won't even fire you.

317
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,003
If he's alive.

318
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,469
Mr. Burns?

319
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,851
(raspy breathing)

320
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,483
-(gasps)
-(screams)

321
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,190
I'm really sorry I hit you,
Mr. Burns.

322
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,571
Here-- let me put some salt
on that eye.

323
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,818
No, please!
I can't bear another thrashing.

324
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,071
Just leave me be.

325
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,322
Y-Yes, Sir.

326
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,199
Must call Smithers.

327
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,243
He'll protect me
from this beast.

328
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,207
I've seen people activate
this machine a thousand times.

329
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,168
Doesn't seem to be
any trick to it.

330
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,538
Let's see-- Smithers.

331
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,455
S-m-i-t-h-e-r-s.

332
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,455
(ringing)

333
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,916
Success! It's ringing!

334
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,666
Moe's Tavern.

335
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,008
<i>I'm looking for</i>
<i>a Mr. Smithers.</i>

336
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,592
<i>First name, Waylon.</i>

337
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:28,057
Oh, so you're looking
for a Mr. Smithers, eh?

338
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,270
First name, Waylon, is it?

339
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,481
Listen to me, you!
When I catch you

340
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,151
I'm gonna pull out your eyes
and shove them down your pants

341
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,651
so you can watch me kick
the crap out of you. Okay?!

342
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,783
Then I'm going to use
your tongue to paint my boat.

343
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,328
Oh, Smithers if only
you could hear me.

344
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,293
(gasps)

345
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,830
Something tells me
Mr. Burns needs me.

346
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,115
(shouting)

347
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,208
Praise God.
I think the thug

348
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,843
has finally gone home
for the day.

349
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,510
Now I can make my escape.

350
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,471
(yelps)

351
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,390
Hi, Mr. Burns.
You want your coffee now?

352
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,348
Uh, no, I'm, uh...
making it myself.

353
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,509
(rattling)

354
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,887
Hear that?

355
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,934
The percolations are imminent.

356
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,307
No need to come in.

357
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,904
Cease your ingress.

358
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:15,979
(nervous laugh)

359
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,023
(sighs)

360
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,565
(knocking)

361
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,150
Stay back, Homer.

362
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,525
Approach no further.
Coffee's already made.

363
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,571
I stomped the beans myself.

364
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,275
Well, can I at least
drive you home, Mr. Burns?

365
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,156
-It's 5:00.
-No! I thought, uh--

366
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,293
I thought I'd chauffeur
myself this evening.

367
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,910
Yes, that's what I thought.

368
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,327
How difficult could it be?

369
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,035
I'm sure the manual
will indicate

370
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,955
which lever is the velocitator
and which the deceleratrix, hmm?

371
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,085
I can't believe it.

372
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,722
All my life I've avoided
doing things for myself...

373
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,091
but I'm actually enjoying this.

374
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,547
Plus, I'm making
incredible time.

375
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,637
(honking)

376
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,182
Beep beep!
Out of my way!

377
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,175
I'm a motorist.

378
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,096
(screeching)

379
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,564
That's some nice
reckless driving, Mr. B.

380
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,272
Would you like me to shred

381
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,187
those environmental reports
for you, Sir?

382
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,276
Already taken care of.

383
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,701
(chuckling)

384
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,239
Cappuccino, Simpson?

385
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,623
(phone rings)

386
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,329
Ahoy-hoy?

387
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,079
No. You have the wrong number.

388
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,081
This is 5-2-4-6.

389
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,883
I suspect you need more practice
working your telephone machine.

390
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,338
Not at all. Ahoy.

391
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,049
Mr. Burns, is there anything
at all I can do for you?

392
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,630
No, Homer.

393
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,255
You've already done
more for me than any man.

394
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,223
Your brutal attack forced me
to fend for myself.

395
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,684
I realize now that being
waited on hand and foot

396
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,635
is okay for your average Joe,

397
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,385
but it's not for me.

398
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,017
I want to thank you.

399
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:40,898
Thank you.

400
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,441
Thank you.
Thank you.

401
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,235
Oh, my God.

402
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,699
I knew I shouldn't have left.

403
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,819
Ah, welcome back,
Smithers.

404
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,486
Say, do you know
Homer Simpson?

405
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,494
He pitched in
around the office

406
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,075
while you were away.

407
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,830
Bang-up job, Simpson,
but I guess it's back

408
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,712
to your trusty post
in sector 7G.

409
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,289
(sighs)

410
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,084
You heard the man, Simpson.

411
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,207
Ahh.

412
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,093
And my dear, dear Smithers

413
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,420
You're no longer needed at all.

414
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,086
You're fired. Ta!

415
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,097
You shouldn't have
gone away on vacation.

416
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,638
(gobbling)

417
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,860
Cheer up, Homie.

418
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,480
I just feel terrible about
getting Mr. Smithers fired.

419
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,397
That job was all he had.

420
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,236
Imagine how
you'd feel, Marge

421
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,661
if you got fired
from the...

422
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,160
those things
that... you do.

423
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,753
Quick, Mom, whip up a cake
before Dad fires you.

424
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,079
Don't worry, Dad.

425
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,833
Mr. Smithers
is a resilient man.

426
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,575
I'm sure he can get a great job
at any corporation he wants.

427
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,472
SMITHERS:
Meet your new piano mover.

428
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,933
(groaning)

429
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,223
Now, we're gonna have to put

430
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,765
a steel rod
where your spine was.

431
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,729
Will I ever move
a piano again?

432
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,979
(laughing)

433
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,100
Oh, my goodness
gracious, no.

434
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,227
<i>SMITHERS (on PA):</i>
<i>Get ready for exciting quarter-mile action</i>

435
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,023
<i>at the Springfield Dragstrip.</i>

436
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,777
<i>It'll be motorized mayhem,</i>
<i>mayhem, mayhem...</i>

437
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,450
<i>(lowers voice) Do we need</i>
<i>all those "mayhems"?</i>

438
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,318
<i>We do?</i>
<i>All right, fair enough.</i>

439
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,945
<i>I suppose</i>
<i>you know your business.</i>

440
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,332
<i>(loudly) Get ready for</i>
<i>fun, fun, fun!</i>

441
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,489
<i>(softly)</i>
<i>The people are already here.</i>

442
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,498
<i>We don't need to keep</i>
<i>hustling them like this, do we?</i>

443
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,831
<i>Let go of me!</i>

444
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,705
<i>Where are you throwing me?!</i>

445
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,252
Uh... hello,

446
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,756
is that a "help wanted" sign
in the window?

447
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,298
Uh, yeah. I need someone
to help me

448
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,631
with the midnight
beer delivery.

449
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,546
Your job is
to distract Barney

450
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,894
until it's safely
off the truck.

451
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,850
I'll just wait out back
until then.

452
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,520
I look forward
to working with you.

453
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,429
Mr. Smithers, wait.

454
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:43,227
You can't let yourself end up
in a place like this.

455
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,902
You've got two choices.

456
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,980
You can give up on yourself
and take the Barney-guarding job

457
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,988
like so many of us
have contemplated

458
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,360
in our darkest moments,

459
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,106
or you can admit to yourself

460
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,828
there's only one person
that can make you happy

461
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,159
and do whatever it takes
to get them back!

462
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,504
You're right.

463
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,329
But I'm gonna need
your help.

464
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,334
(clock strikes)

465
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,995
Oh, my God!

466
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,045
TRUCK DRIVER:
Beer delivery. Just sign here.

467
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,588
Oh, no! It's you!

468
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,591
(loud crashing)

469
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,842
(Barney laughing)

470
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:12,934
-DRIVER: Hey!
-BARNEY: Oh, boy!

471
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,258
DRIVER: Give me that!

472
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,181
(metal clattering)

473
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,523
(loud burp)

474
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,064
Okay, I got you covered.

475
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,976
Mr. Burns may have mastered
2,799 of my 2,800 duties,

476
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,897
but I'll wager dollars
to doughnuts

477
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,895
he still can't handle
a call from his mother.

478
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:34,857
You're on.

479
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,236
(phone ringing)

480
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,075
What?

481
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,080
Hello, Mrs. Burns?

482
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,661
This is Waylon Smithers.

483
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,576
I have your son
Montgomery on the line.

484
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,035
That improvident lackwit.

485
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,546
Always too busy striding
about his atom mill

486
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,668
to call his own mother.

487
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,505
I'll give him what-fors
till he cries brassafrax!

488
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,715
(chuckling) Perfect.
When I give the signal

489
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,564
you transfer the call
to Mr. Burns.

490
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,769
After she tears into him,
I'll rush in and save the day.

491
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,770
Got it.

492
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,024
I'm transferring a call
in to you, Mr. Burns.

493
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,067
BURNS: <i>No problemo.</i>

494
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,071
Uh...

495
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,072
ooh.

496
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,993
Um...

497
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,161
-(dial tone)
-Uh-oh.

498
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,159
BURNS:
Ahoy-hoy?

499
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,240
Hoy?

500
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,909
(in falsetto)
Hello, Mr. Burns.

501
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,285
This is your mother.

502
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,331
(whispering) No!

503
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,325
Ugh...

504
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,956
Oh, hello, mater.

505
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,342
Um... sorry about pulling
the plug on you and all.

506
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,671
Who could have known
you'd pull through and...

507
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,176
live for another five decades?

508
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,299
Ooh, is my face red.

509
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,716
(whispering)
Mrs. Burns is 122 years old

510
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,465
so try to sound more desiccated.

511
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,227
And she doesn't call
her son "Mr. Burns."

512
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,980
(cracking falsetto)
Son, this is Mrs. Burns.

513
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:54,233
I just called to say
I don't love you.

514
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,398
You are a bad son, Mon... tel.

515
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,396
So...

516
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,657
(screams)

517
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,989
Impersonate my mother,
will you?

518
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,994
And you, Smithers, you must
have put him up to it.

519
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,537
I'm glad I fired you.

520
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,672
You really blew it
this time, Smithers.

521
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,750
(yells)

522
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,720
Stop that!
Stop that at once!

523
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,838
You're fighting!

524
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,434
Stop fighting
like a girl, Simpson.

525
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,142
(grunting)
Okay.

526
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,306
Heh-heh-heh.

527
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:31,861
(screams)

528
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,150
Stop it! Stop it, I say!

529
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,487
I'll teach you
how to use a phone, you boob!

530
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,584
D'oh! D'oh! D'oh!

531
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,579
It's for you.

532
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,540
D'oh!

533
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,462
I'll show you!
(growling)

534
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,883
(chortling)

535
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,842
Ow!

536
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,553
(screaming)

537
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,344
(thudding)

538
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,637
Oh, my...

539
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,019
Here comes the endangered condor

540
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,022
into the power lines.

541
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,233
Mmm. Mmm, mmm.

542
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,943
I've got Bobo
hot from the dryer.

543
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,443
Careful not to burn yourself
on his eye.

544
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,355
I don't need you
to do any of this.

545
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,413
I'm totally
self-reliant now.

546
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,158
What I would like, though,
is a Spanish peanut.

547
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,988
Skin?

548
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,117
Mmm. Mmm.

549
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,794
It's a remarkable thing.

550
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,582
In the short time
you were gone

551
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,416
I learned to be
completely self-reli...

552
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,923
...ant.

553
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,585
Oh, and as for that
brutish fellow

554
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,303
who knocked me
out the window,

555
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,394
see that he gets
what's coming to him.

556
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,509
I already have, Sir.

557
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,596
What'd you
get that for?

558
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,682
For knocking Mr. Burns out
of a third-story window.

559
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:51,767
Makes sense to me.

560
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,022
Did he die?

561
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,313
What am I, a doctor?
