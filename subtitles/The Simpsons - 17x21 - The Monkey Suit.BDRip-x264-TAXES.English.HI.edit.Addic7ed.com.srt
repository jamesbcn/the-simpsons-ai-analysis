00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,281
(GASPS)

351
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,804
Now, Mr. Flanders, you're
familiar with the Bible, correct?

352
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,201
As familiar as
it's proper to be.

353
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,810
Don't worry, Lisa.

354
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,486
I've got the answer to
your problems right here.

355
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,171
Look, Homie.
I brought you a beer.

356
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,241
Thanks, Marge.

357
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,560
(STRAINING)

358
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,526
It's not a twist-off.

359
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,648
(CONTINUES STRAINING)
Come on.

360
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,008
And you are positive that man
and ape cannot be related?

361
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,890
As sure as I am that
Jesus hates hip-hop!

362
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,328
Come on, open.
I want what's in you!

363
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,765
(GIBBERING)

364
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,331
As a matter...
Want you...

365
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,561
Homer.
Stupid.

366
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,846
(GIBBERING)

367
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,160
Homer, I'm trying to...

368
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,571
(GIBBERING)

369
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,086
Would you shut your yap,
you big monkey-faced gorilla!

370
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,321
(ALL GASP)

371
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,080
Mr. Flanders, you've sworn
to tell the truth.

372
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,488
Can you say that this man could not
possibly be related to that ape?

373
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,011
(GIBBERING)

374
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,686
You win, Lisa.

375
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,046
This court hereby rules

376
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,966
that the law forbidding the
teaching of evolution is repealed.

377
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,201
(GRUNTS)

378
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,364
Oh, wait.
It was a twist-off.

379
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,728
Oh, thanks, Mom.

380
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,531
Thank you, honey,
for opening my eyes.

381
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,405
I can't wait to see what
evolution will make next.

382
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,323
Maybe a bird
with a people face,

383
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,528
or a bear with pants on.

384
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,726
NED: Let's go, boys.

385
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,689
Your poor old
Popsicle's been licked.

386
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,649
Mr. Flanders, wait.
Hmm?

387
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,802
I want you to know
I respect your beliefs

388
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,486
and I can see how deeply
you feel about them.

389
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,245
I just don't think religion
should be taught in our schools,

390
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,483
any more than you'd want
scientists teaching at the church.

391
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,048
Well, l wish this
world would evolve

392
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,168
a few more kids
like you, Lisa.

393
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,322
What say we take
our worthy adversary

394
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,801
out for a hot fudge
fun-day?

395
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,251
(NELSON'S VOICE)
Cram it, ya God-wad.

396
