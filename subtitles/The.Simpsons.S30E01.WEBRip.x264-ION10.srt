1
00:00:10,662 --> 00:00:11,755
Everyone...

2
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:13,657
...was napping.

3
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:16,059
- Ahmed Adoody.
- Wait, there's...

4
00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:17,191
- My people...
- Come down to the stu...

5
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:22,674
Steamed ham.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,113
The cosmic ballet goes on.

7
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:27,201
- Gigantism.
- King of the world!

8
00:00:27,244 --> 00:00:29,551
Oh, this is the best gift
of all, Homer.

9
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:31,553
- It is?
- What's his name?

10
00:00:31,596 --> 00:00:33,120
Number Eight.

11
00:00:33,163 --> 00:00:35,339
I mean,
Santa's Little Helper.

12
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:38,429
Why does Homer talk
like Walter Matthau?

13
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:45,697
Hey, Martin Princess.

14
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:49,353
If you like that cello so much,
why don't you marry it?

15
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:51,486
- No heckling.
- Way to quash 'em, sir.

16
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:53,792
Hey, Skinner, if you like
Chalmers so much,

17
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:55,142
why don't you marry him?

18
00:00:55,185 --> 00:00:56,708
Well, as the superintendent,

19
00:00:56,752 --> 00:00:58,580
he's married to all
the principals.

20
00:00:58,623 --> 00:01:00,582
Thank you.
You've made the anniversary

21
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:03,367
of my wife's death
even more depressing.

22
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:05,152
Who likes happy songs?

23
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:09,156
Well, for those of you
who didn't cheer,

24
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:12,942
here's a very sad song
about the world today.

25
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:16,206
She loves me.
She loves me not.

26
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,035
Oh, why do I always use flowers
with two petals?

27
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:31,265
Simpson, pull the fire alarm.

28
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:32,614
You want me
to embarrass my sister

29
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:34,181
in front of the whole school?

30
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:35,225
No.

31
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:37,227
I dared you.

32
00:01:39,838 --> 00:01:40,926
Don't do it, Bart.

33
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,015
Please. I love you.

34
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:45,409
I'm not doing it.
I'm refusing a dare.

35
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:48,369
You just signed
your death warrant, Simpson.

36
00:01:48,412 --> 00:01:50,197
And we're the witnesses.

37
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,374
All we need is a notary.

38
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:57,204
- Notary. Notary.
- We'll see.

39
00:01:57,247 --> 00:01:59,206
Oh, it's that kid
who refused a dare.

40
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:00,729
His life is ruined.

41
00:02:00,772 --> 00:02:03,427
I'm turning my back on you.

42
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:05,168
Hi, Bart.

43
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:06,343
Simpson, I'd like to see you
in my office.

44
00:02:06,387 --> 00:02:07,823
Your parents are waiting.

45
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,956
Bart's got a dad.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,958
Bart's got a dad.

47
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:14,395
I do not.

48
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:18,225
Bart, I just want to say...

49
00:02:18,268 --> 00:02:20,575
I'm so proud of you.

50
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:23,012
Dad, do you think
I did the right thing?

51
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:25,232
Of course, absolutely.

52
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:27,756
You did the worst thing
any boy can do.

53
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:30,628
It's worse than wetting
your pants while on Santa's lap,

54
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:32,978
and I've been on both sides
of that one.

55
00:02:33,022 --> 00:02:34,023
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:37,026
Bart, you have to take a dare.

57
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:38,984
- But what if it's...?
- Any dare.

58
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:41,378
Grampa, Dad says
I have to take a dare.

59
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:43,337
I had Homer on a dare,

60
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,209
and as horrible as that
worked out, I'd do that again.

61
00:02:46,253 --> 00:02:48,342
Why did someone dare you
to have Homer?

62
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:50,344
It was after the war,
we needed babies.

63
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:52,563
Bart, I have a secret.

64
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:55,218
I've never been happier
to be your mother.

65
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:57,133
You're a good boy.

66
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,223
Mom, please.
Somebody might hear you.

67
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:06,621
Oh, look at him!

68
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:09,406
Bart's mom wears
a seat belt.

69
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:12,627
Let them laugh, Bart.

70
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,368
This is wonderful.

71
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:17,893
Every laugh turns into one more
smoochie-poo from Mom.

72
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:21,505
Cut it out.

73
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:26,031
Three cheers for
the mama's boys.

74
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:28,164
Sorry to do this
on Mother's Day!

75
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:35,432
So, Simpson,
word on the street is

76
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:37,434
you're looking for a dare.

77
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:39,306
Yeah, fine.

78
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:41,264
I need to get this monkey
off my back.

79
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:43,179
Hey, how about that for a dare?

80
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,746
Putting a monkey on his back.

81
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:46,617
And after we're done, then what?

82
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:49,403
We have a monkey that's
our permanent responsibility.

83
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:52,362
Yeah, think ahead, dingus.

84
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:55,844
Simpson, I dare you to jump
into the reservoir

85
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:57,498
from Dead Boy's Ledge.

86
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,805
We'll be watching
from Haw-Haw Heights.

87
00:04:04,548 --> 00:04:05,680
Simpson, is that your kid?

88
00:04:05,723 --> 00:04:07,421
Oh, my God.
I've got to stop him!

89
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:08,944
I dare you not to.

90
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:12,295
It was a joke, idiot.
Get your kid.

91
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,646
Bart!

92
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,431
Do I really have to do this?

93
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:18,736
I dare you.

94
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,390
Dare you. Dare you.

95
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:22,392
Dare you.

96
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:24,133
I love Echo Canyon.

97
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:26,178
Oh, this place sure has
a lot of names.

98
00:04:26,222 --> 00:04:28,180
Cowabunga!

99
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:32,881
We've done all we could.

100
00:04:32,924 --> 00:04:33,882
Run!

101
00:04:33,925 --> 00:04:35,187
Beat it!

102
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:38,016
He'll be fine.

103
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,585
And my burrito's ready.

104
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:45,110
Your boy should wake up soon.

105
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:47,374
All right. This time,
he's really done it.

106
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:49,463
We're gonna have
to do something.

107
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:51,508
Change schools. Move.

108
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:53,467
Whatever it takes.

109
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,946
Mom?

110
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,732
- Sweetie, are you okay?
- I am.

111
00:04:57,775 --> 00:05:00,952
Then why would you do such
a stupid, stupid thing?

112
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:03,259
Marge, Marge.
As someone who's fallen off

113
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,000
a cliff multiple times,

114
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:06,784
the best thing we can do

115
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:09,613
is teach him how
to fall off cliffs.

116
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:11,223
I just want to know, Bart.

117
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:14,226
I had hope and now I don't.
Why?

118
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:17,404
Please, O Lord.

119
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:19,493
Let him think of an awesome lie.

120
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:23,758
Well, when I was
in the other world...

121
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:24,933
What other world?

122
00:05:26,195 --> 00:05:27,805
I'm not sure.

123
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:32,593
But it was joyful, clouds,
harps, Abe Lincoln.

124
00:05:32,636 --> 00:05:34,159
Oh, my God, Marge!

125
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:35,552
I think our son went to heaven.

126
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:37,162
Were there any other presidents?

127
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:39,513
- No.
- It was heaven. What else, boy?

128
00:05:39,556 --> 00:05:41,166
I have a message for you, Mom.

129
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,168
- From who?
- Jesus.

130
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:45,388
Don't say that if it's not true.

131
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:46,607
You have to believe him, Marge.

132
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,391
It's a deathbed confession.

133
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:50,001
He's not on his deathbed.

134
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:52,830
The guy in the bed
before him died.

135
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:56,791
Mom. Jesus said to tell you,
things will get better.

136
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:59,533
Oh, I really want
to believe that.

137
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:02,492
If you saw Jesus,
did you see anything else?

138
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,581
I saw your dad, Grandpa Bouvier.

139
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,584
Tell me something he said
that only I would know.

140
00:06:07,628 --> 00:06:09,194
He said...

141
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:10,500
he thinks Homer is an idiot.

142
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:14,896
Oh, my God, I can hear
his voice through you.

143
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:16,811
Excuse me a minute.

144
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:18,290
Good work, boy.

145
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:20,075
You got us off the hook
in the short term,

146
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:23,034
which is all that ever matters.

147
00:06:26,004 --> 00:06:30,477
- Tell me more about heaven, son.
- Jesus rides a rainbow horse.

148
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,479
Fascinating.
Is the horse rainbow-colored?

149
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:34,698
Or does it walk on a rainbow?

150
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:36,874
Rainbows come out
its butt.

151
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:39,268
Let me ponder that with joy.

152
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:41,531
Tell me more, son.

153
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:43,707
Well, there's no cracks
on the sidewalks.

154
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,927
And saying you brushed
your teeth makes it true.

155
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:50,801
You can go to baseball games
with all the dead players.

156
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:52,499
And you always catch a home run.

157
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,588
And the angels talk
to each other like this...

158
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:58,679
Does this Jesus
have any tattoos

159
00:06:58,722 --> 00:07:00,724
or distinguishing marks?

160
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:04,554
No, but he really thinks
the sermons are too long.

161
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:08,166
Boys, we're gonna have a talk
with the Reverend.

162
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:13,128
Bart.

163
00:07:13,171 --> 00:07:15,130
I've held my tongue,
because I appreciate

164
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:16,914
you not ruining my song.

165
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,482
Can't ruin what already sucks.
Burn.

166
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:22,746
All right.
I'm just gonna say it.

167
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,661
I don't think
you really saw Jesus.

168
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:26,315
You know, the Lord warned me

169
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:28,535
there'd be disbelievers.
Begone!

170
00:07:28,578 --> 00:07:31,320
I don't know why you're
doing this, but beware,

171
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:33,670
little lies lead to big lies.

172
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:37,065
And big lies get punished.

173
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:39,763
That's the Devil ringing
that bell.

174
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:41,156
Are you gonna answer?

175
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,114
Hey, don't think you can scare
the boy who died

176
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:44,768
and went to heaven.

177
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:46,857
Get the door.

178
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:49,512
Hey, cut it out.

179
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:51,558
Oh, no, it's stuck.

180
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:53,516
Hello, Bart.

181
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,692
We are Christian
movie producers.

182
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:59,566
So, you give all your profits
back to the church?

183
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:04,962
You...
Could you...

184
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:06,660
Could you get your dad?

185
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:09,227
Homer, we're the best
in the business.

186
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:12,666
Our films average 98%
on Rotten Communion Wafers.

187
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:16,234
Now, we'd like to tell
your son's story.

188
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:19,760
You want to make a movie
out of what happened to Bart?

189
00:08:19,803 --> 00:08:20,717
Well, absolutely.

190
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:22,632
Unless it's not true.

191
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:26,549
Okay, I could admit
the boy totally lied

192
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:31,206
or I could make a movie
inspired by true events.

193
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:35,602
Brother Homer,
why do you hesitate?

194
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:39,214
I hesitate because I am stunned

195
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:41,651
that you doubt the Word of God!

196
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:43,653
Then we have a deal.

197
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:44,785
Not so fast.

198
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:47,701
Like most of America, I think
I know the movie business.

199
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:49,964
Please. What would you like?

200
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:51,705
I want input on the script.

201
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:53,576
I want two seats
to the premiere.

202
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,709
And my wife needs
a seat as well.

203
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:57,711
And I'm not thanking
the Georgia Film Commission,

204
00:08:57,754 --> 00:08:59,364
no matter what.

205
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:02,063
We will need to pray on this,
Brother Homer.

206
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:03,978
Of course. So will we.

207
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:05,632
Kneel down, boy.

208
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:06,850
What for?

209
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:11,855
Because we're going to pray
like we often do.

210
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:15,076
Heavenly God, who art in heaven,
holler out your name.

211
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:17,818
Thy Kingdom come.
I'm almost done.

212
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:20,516
Can this square join
your circle?

213
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,649
Absotively-posilutely.

214
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:24,607
In that same spirit,
I'm glad to hear it.

215
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:26,609
- Oh, hi-diddly-do. A-dum-dum-diddly.
- Diddly-doodly, brother.

216
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:28,045
- Diddly-doodly-diddly-dice.
- Diddly. Diddly.

217
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:29,830
- Nice to diddly meet you.
- Brotherino.

218
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:33,703
I heard movie meetings were
horrible, but I had no idea.

219
00:09:33,747 --> 00:09:35,226
Well, perhaps you could write

220
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,272
the screenplay
with Brother Homer.

221
00:09:37,715 --> 00:09:38,969
I don't think so.

222
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:40,710
Wait, wait, wait.

223
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:42,756
I'm being filled
with the spirit of Jesus.

224
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:45,628
Oh, yeah? What's he saying?

225
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:48,675
He says he wants Dad
and Mr. Flanders

226
00:09:48,718 --> 00:09:51,634
to work together day after day
in a tiny room,

227
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:53,680
preferably holding hands.

228
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:54,768
Why, you...

229
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:57,031
No booze, sodas,
or chocolate milk.

230
00:09:57,074 --> 00:09:59,729
And the only snacks
are celery sticks.

231
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:01,209
Celery sticks.

232
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:03,298
Not done yet.

233
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:05,822
Dad, Jesus wants you
to take Flanders bowling.

234
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:08,129
Tie his shoes for him.

235
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:09,826
- What for?
- And kiss his ball.

236
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,655
- Why, you...
- This is the Word of the Lord.

237
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:15,919
With that kind of attention,
I could roll a 73.

238
00:10:28,757 --> 00:10:30,804
What are you guys doing?

239
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:32,893
What's it look like?
We're working.

240
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:36,810
Maybe we should take a break.

241
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:38,855
Good idea.

242
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:41,728
Okay, come on.

243
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:44,818
Lenny, you've pitched, that's
what she said, 30 times already.

244
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:47,037
I highly doubt
that's the Word of God.

245
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:48,735
- Try something else.
- That's what she said.

246
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:50,780
That's great!

247
00:10:50,824 --> 00:10:52,042
That's going in.

248
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,349
Mine. Mine. Mine. Mine.

249
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:57,700
Lenny and me. Mine.
Mostly mine. Mine. Mine.

250
00:10:57,744 --> 00:10:59,833
I was thinking it
when Barney said it. Mine.

251
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:03,053
Reading for Marge...
Emily Deschanel.

252
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:05,752
Oh, yeah. First,
I have a question for you.

253
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:08,929
On Bones, did you ever have any
bones with meat left on them,

254
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:10,844
and if so,
where are those bones?

255
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,933
Maybe she should just
read the part.

256
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:16,110
Homie, because
of everything that's happened,

257
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:18,155
I think we need to take a break.

258
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:20,767
No! Marge, no!

259
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,116
A break means forever.

260
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,900
I'll change. I will.

261
00:11:23,944 --> 00:11:26,076
No, Homer,
she's just acting the part.

262
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,949
Oh, of course,
of course, yes.

263
00:11:28,992 --> 00:11:31,342
As a help to me,
when you're acting,

264
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:33,867
could you hold up one hand
so I'll know?

265
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,346
Oh, okay.

266
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,131
- Thank you.
- Homie.

267
00:11:37,174 --> 00:11:38,872
Yes, Marge.
You have a question?

268
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:40,221
She's acting!

269
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:42,876
Right, right, right.
She's acting.

270
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,965
When you're acting,
could you raise one arm

271
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:47,445
and swing your foot in a circle
and keep winking?

272
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:49,317
Listen, Homie.

273
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,885
Marge, what are you doing?!
You're acting really weird.

274
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:53,321
Is he okay?

275
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:55,802
You thought I was okay
when you married me.

276
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:57,325
Actors.

277
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:59,327
Gal Gadot reading for Lisa.

278
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,198
- You've got the part!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

279
00:12:01,242 --> 00:12:03,461
I know you were great
in Fast and Furious,

280
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:05,159
but what else have you been in?

281
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:06,813
Did you see Wonder Woman?

282
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:10,207
Whenever I see the DC logo,
I immediately fall asleep.

283
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:11,905
Homer, she's got the part.

284
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:15,038
Okay, you get this
and I get Gene Hackman for me.

285
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:16,170
He already said no.

286
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:17,998
Then you have
to help me kidnap him.

287
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,564
Excuse me.

288
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:21,871
So, do you want
to put me on tape or...?

289
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:25,179
Hey! Can we use your magic lasso
to kidnap Gene Hackman?

290
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:26,702
No.

291
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,269
Barney is here to read for Noah.

292
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:30,619
There's no Noah in this movie.

293
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:33,056
All right,
but you better tell the camels.

294
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:40,934
Mom, do you really believe
Bart's story?

295
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:43,850
Lisa, do you know how I've
gotten to this point in life?

296
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:47,027
Two things...
blind faith and a little wine.

297
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,943
Can you get me the wine that
I keep in Mommy's knitting basket?

298
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:52,641
I know where you keep it.

299
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:54,991
There was no knitting in there.

300
00:12:56,993 --> 00:13:00,954
Jesus said to tell you,
things will get better.

301
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:03,478
And... cut.

302
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:06,002
I wish you and I had
a relationship like that.

303
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:07,917
Why, you little...

304
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:13,662
They wish they had
a relationship like us!

305
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:17,492
There is nothing a director
can do on set that's wrong.

306
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,669
Take five, everybody.

307
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:22,192
What do you want?

308
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:24,412
I told you,
lies lead to punishment,

309
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:26,675
especially when you film them.

310
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:29,069
What are you talking about?

311
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:31,071
If you really saw
Grandpa Bouvier,

312
00:13:31,114 --> 00:13:32,637
which finger was he missing?

313
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:34,988
I believe he was wearing
a beekeeping outfit

314
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:36,424
when I saw him.

315
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:38,426
Trick question.
He's missing a leg.

316
00:13:38,469 --> 00:13:40,645
Okay.

317
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:42,430
So maybe I fudged a few things.

318
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:44,998
It's not the original lie
that gets people.

319
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,651
It's the cover-up.

320
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:48,784
It's gonna get worse and worse

321
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,482
and worse and worse and worse.

322
00:13:51,526 --> 00:13:53,441
Dad, I'm starting to feel weird.

323
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:56,357
I'm not your Dad.
I'm the actor playing him.

324
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,663
You need all that
padding to play Homer?

325
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:00,056
Yes, and I'm fat to begin with.

326
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:04,549
Okay, this one's for China.

327
00:14:05,193 --> 00:14:07,934
This one's for Australia.

328
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:10,110
And this one's
for the youth market.

329
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:12,112
- Dad?
- This is all because of you.

330
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:13,765
I have never been so excited.

331
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:15,463
Now what do you want to say?

332
00:14:15,506 --> 00:14:18,074
Is there anything
you want to tell anyone?

333
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:20,947
Any inaccuracies
or blatant lies?

334
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:24,907
The scene we said is New York

335
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:27,910
is actually downtown Calgary,

336
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:29,303
and vice versa.

337
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:37,137
No, no. I'm going to heaven!

338
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:43,186
Hello, Bart.

339
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,927
Didn't they give you
a real leg in heaven?

340
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:46,581
I lost it in a bet.

341
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:49,105
A bet that my grandson
was a good boy.

342
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:50,933
Save me, Jesus!

343
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:53,066
I'm trying very hard
to forgive you.

344
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:54,415
It is very tough.

345
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,547
What are you gonna do to me?

346
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:58,288
Bart, God is love.

347
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,175
And here's Marge
with the actress who played her.

348
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:17,003
Oh, in real life
we don't get along.

349
00:15:21,181 --> 00:15:22,617
Who are you worshipping?

350
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,401
Are you telling the truth?

351
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:26,055
He will not be taking
any questions

352
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:27,317
unless they're submitted
in writing

353
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:29,580
on an index card
with some bacon on it.

354
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:31,582
Turkey bacon does not count.

355
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:36,326
Tell the people what
you have witnessed, Bartholomew.

356
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,808
And if they doubt you, viciously
attack their character.

357
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:41,853
Yes, Jesus.

358
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,684
Bart, you're my hero.

359
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:48,817
Now, who wants a hamburger?

360
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,037
I would never say any
of those things.

361
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,257
Now sing, Bart.

362
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:57,434
Sing because I cannot.

363
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:02,048
<i>One more chance</i>

364
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:04,659
<i>It is my destiny</i>

365
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:07,140
<i>To start my road</i>

366
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:11,274
<i>To Christianity</i>

367
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:16,018
<i>I always knew
he had a mission</i>

368
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:20,457
<i>Thank God we called off
the mortician</i>

369
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:22,372
<i>One more chance</i>

370
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:28,030
<i>He's alive,
someone quick call Channel 5</i>

371
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:30,424
<i>One more chance</i>

372
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:40,042
Not enough Bart.

373
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:44,612
Oh, someone pinch me.

374
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:47,310
Thank you. Thank you
for this Christian Oscar.

375
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:49,617
And I'd like to thank
the Academy of Arts

376
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,140
and Anti-Sciences.

377
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:53,838
Are you guys awake?

378
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:56,102
What's the matter, sweetie?

379
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:59,061
Mom, I lied about everything.

380
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:00,410
Oh, my God!

381
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:02,151
Don't worry, Marge.

382
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:03,979
It's just a little movie.
Nobody will see it.

383
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,633
Mr. Flanders just called.

384
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:09,202
The movie's on pace to make
a hundred million dollars.

385
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:11,682
It crushed all the good movies
that came out this week.

386
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:13,510
Take that, Paul Thomas Anderson.

387
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:17,210
Oh, my God.
Our movie's a hit and a lie.

388
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:19,299
Oh, all hit movies are lies,
Marge.

389
00:17:19,342 --> 00:17:21,083
Did you see Argo?

390
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:22,476
None of that happened.

391
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,782
And I have strong doubts
about The Incredibles.

392
00:17:24,826 --> 00:17:26,958
Well, we have
to tell people the truth.

393
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:28,134
Of course, of course.

394
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:30,310
Could we do it after
the Golden Globes?

395
00:17:30,353 --> 00:17:31,528
No!

396
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:33,226
But that's the one
with TV people

397
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:34,749
and movie people
in the same room.

398
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:36,359
We said no!

399
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:40,929
First off,

400
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:44,324
we will donate every penny
of our profits to charity.

401
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:46,239
Keeping only enough money

402
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:49,198
to cover changing our lives
in a major way.

403
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:51,200
Hey, what is this?

404
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:53,376
Fine, fine, fine, all of it.

405
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,465
Okay, look, I just want to say,

406
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:58,251
I'm just a man
trying to raise his son.

407
00:17:58,294 --> 00:17:59,948
I make mistakes.

408
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:02,211
Sometimes they're little,
sometimes they're big.

409
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:06,041
Blame me, but don't blame
the boy for being a boy.

410
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:11,394
And let me just ask this.
Is it possible

411
00:18:11,438 --> 00:18:14,223
any other religious beliefs
are founded on myths?

412
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:15,790
This interview is over.

413
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,227
God created the world
in seven days. See you later.

414
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:20,055
In what some are calling
the worst scandal

415
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,579
in the history of religion,
Bart Simpson lied

416
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:25,147
when he claimed
he had talked to Jesus.

417
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:27,758
But maybe
part of the fault lies with us

418
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:31,240
for desperately wanting a
miracle in these troubled times.

419
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:34,548
Times which we bring into your
homes at 5:00, 6:00 and 11:00.

420
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:37,028
Here's a hobo lost
in a hurricane.

421
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:39,553
I had a hat!

422
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:41,381
Hey, Bart.

423
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:42,817
I brought you some ice cream.

424
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,035
Up here.

425
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:49,432
The only friend I have is
the Frisbee on the roof.

426
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:52,783
Well, you'll always have me.

427
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:54,350
Careful.

428
00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:56,265
Dad didn't nail these in
too well.

429
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:57,788
You think God will forgive me?

430
00:18:57,832 --> 00:18:59,355
Don't tell anyone I said that.

431
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:03,011
Well, if there is a God,
from what I know,

432
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:04,665
said God will forgive you

433
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,233
if you truly have remorse
in your heart.

434
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:08,408
Well, thanks, Lis.

435
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:10,236
Don't tell anyone
I asked you that.

436
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:12,412
I did it 'cause you're
the smartest person I know.

437
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:14,327
And don't tell anybody
I said that.

438
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,632
I won't!

439
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:21,812
Dad must have raked
the leaves today.

440
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:23,858
Now that's a miracle.

441
00:19:31,976 --> 00:19:33,978
I made it.

442
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:38,438
Gal Gadot?!

443
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:40,396
They like me so much,
I get to visit.

444
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,444
I made it too, boy, and
Jesus really wants to meet you.

445
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:45,662
Go on in!

446
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:47,316
Where are you going?

447
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,232
This place is so boring.

448
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:52,713
Time for another game
of Mother, May I?

449
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,283
Please send me back to Earth.

450
00:19:57,326 --> 00:20:00,503
Yes, yes. You can be a turtle
or a pharmaceutical CEO.

451
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:02,070
Turtle, please.

452
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:38,541
