00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,978
It's chemistry!

175
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,187
-Which is science.
-What?!

176
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,897
(dog howls)

177
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,157
See, I have asked an enormous
cross-section of women

178
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,991
one single question--

179
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,826
what attracts you to a man?

180
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,331
Let us listen and learn
and have some lemonade,

181
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,173
which I just squeezed nicely.

182
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,329
(overlapping voices)

183
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,996
<i>...the most important</i>
<i>thing that I look for...</i>

184
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,995
<i>I like it when they're tall.</i>

185
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,757
<i>-Blue eyes!</i>
<i>-Definitely wants kids.</i>

186
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,088
Hmm, I didn't hear the last one.

187
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,425
First I'll replace
these Coke bottle glasses

188
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,933
with invisible blue contacts.

189
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,675
Mm-hmm.

190
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,687
{\an8}Next, of course, is shoe lifts for height.

191
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,439
{\an8}Make you much taller,
look down upon people.

192
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,061
{\an8}It's wonderful. Whoa, whoa...

193
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,937
{\an8}Hey, look at me.
I'm Herman Munster! (laughs)

194
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,445
Actually, he had Lily,
who was quite a dish.

195
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,283
So, do you, uh, find me attractive?

196
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,696
-Sorry, but no.
-Oh, curse the luck!

197
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:41,075
And this is an android that I programmed
to say nothing but "yes."

198
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,623
(electronic whooshing)

199
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,168
Why? Why? Why?

200
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,551
What am I over-look-ing?

201
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,918
Uh, Professor, don't be offended.

202
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,126
Do you think it might be your voice?

203
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,176
Why, what's wrong with my voice,

204
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,260
with the up and down
and the extra words

205
00:09:56,345 --> 00:10:00,305
and the terminal nonsense
in the hoyven clyven wayen.

206
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,103
Oh, my God, it's the voice.

207
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,345
Duh.

208
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,687
MARGE: Hello.

209
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,691
We're here to see Abe Simpson.

210
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,863
-I brought him a homemade card!
-I brought me. That's enough.

211
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,701
-Oh... what the...
-(woman humming)

212
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,780
Gee, I thought
they'd be over this by now.

213
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,197
(humming)

214
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,616
Wow, they are really out of it.

215
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,955
There must be some way
to take advantage of them.

216
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,381
You're telling me!

217
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:28,835
Eh.

218
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,626
This little device,
which fits under the tongue,

219
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,545
will change everything.

220
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,888
(deep, sexy voice)
This voice is an amalgam of great voices

221
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,261
(like Clark Gable)
from Clark Gable...

222
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,598
(like Walter Cronkite)
to Walter Cronkite...

223
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,272
(like Rush Limbaugh)
to Rush Limbaugh!

224
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,521
(deep, sexy voice)
I don't agree with his politics,

225
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,652
but his body is a natural echo chamber.

226
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,649
Wow. That does change everything.

227
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,442
You turned me on.

228
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,025
Oh, it's time
for a little field test, I see.

229
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,611
Any other advice, Homer?

230
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,906
Yep-- hang out at yoga classes.

231
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,120
That's where the ladies are.

232
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,291
(normal voice)
How would you know about yoga class?

233
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,790
Uh, I thought it was yogurt class.

234
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,634
{\an8}21! Dealer wins again.

235
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,879
Now, here's our headliner, Dolly Parton.

236
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,715
(banjo playing)

237
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,307
Oh, she's good.

238
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,135
-Bart!
<i>-Ay, caramba!</i>

239
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,345
{\an8}You're taking advantage of these people

240
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,185
{\an8}who don't know where they are.

241
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,060
{\an8}I'm taking them back where they belong.

242
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,397
Oh, no, you don't.

243
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,612
He just comped me a suite!

244
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,403
-Fantastic!
-(clattering, thud)

245
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,533
-(meows)
-(gasps)

246
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,906
You can't keep pumping powerful drugs

247
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,496
into people who can't
even bite into a peach.

248
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,582
Mrs. Simpson, it's a fact.

249
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,418
If these seniors aren't medicated,

250
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,713
I can't binge-watch <i>Boardwalk Empire.</i>

251
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,467
Nucky dies at the end!

252
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,299
Yeah, well, screw you.

253
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,094
I'm going to report you to the state.

254
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,427
-I really don't care.
-(groans)

255
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,137
Wha... You broke me.

256
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,184
I'm going to say something
I've never said.

257
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,938
How can I help you?

258
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,574
Um, I'll wait outside
'cause they might make me do something.

259
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,529
I've changed my height,
I've changed my eyes,

260
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,029
my relationship status--

261
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,531
I-I don't know why
I put "unavailable" there.

262
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,283
That certainly did not help matters.

263
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:25,365
But now it is time to change my voice...

264
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,753
(clears throat) Oyce... Voy...

265
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,420
(deep, sexy voice)
And the hoyvin and the flayvin

266
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,879
are now "hasta la vista, Frinky."

267
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,040
-Ooh.
-(hums)

268
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,418
Mm...

269
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,384
(chuckles softly)

270
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,375
(scoffs) I'm always next to the jerk

271
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,928
who comes here to meet women.

272
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,261
Hey, look, I get you.

273
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,555
You broke up with a long-time
high school boyfriend

274
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,219
'cause he just wasn't going anywhere.

275
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,058
Then you play the field,
but it's all losers

276
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,483
who just want to take from you.

277
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,561
Now you're just hoping beyond hope
for a man you can hug

278
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,227
who'll organize the wires behind your TV.

279
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,737
And believe you me, sweetheart,

280
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,318
I can organize every wire you have.

281
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,954
Now I'd like to show you a picture
of my new puppy.

282
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,792
{\an8}Yeah, his name's... (sneezes)
(normal voice) Logarithm.

283
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,748
{\an8}(clears throat)
(deep, sexy voice) I mean Larry.

284
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,408
Aw... Here's my number.

285
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,078
And to prove it's not a lie...

286
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,587
(cell phone ringing)

287
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,918
-Yeah, baby.
-(both giggling)

288
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,380
Call me!

289
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,585
Man, you're reading page three,
and the next thing you know,

290
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,927
you're finishing the last article, hmm.

291
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,813
-(normal voice) I got all their numbers!
-Boy, you are smooth.

292
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,101
Carl smooth. Now I'd better get home.

293
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,435
And in case Marge is mad,
can I borrow that chip?

294
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,272
Oh, sure thing, pal. I have extras.

295
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,276
(sniffs)

296
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,452
-(low voice) Chitter, chitter, baby.
-(chitters)

297
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,623
I was so worried.
Where have you been?

298
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,115
No, don't tell me.

299
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,327
I don't want to hear
one of your stupid lies.

300
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,997
(deep voice) Marge, my dear,

301
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,296
you are the pork chop with gravy on top,

302
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:04,391
and I'm the applesauce
that brings out your flavor.

303
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,218
Oh, Homie.

304
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,178
(Homer coughs)

305
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,136
(deep voice) What the hell was that?

306
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,396
(normal voice)
What the... You're not my wife.

307
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,558
Which I find intriguing.

308
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,897
Suit yourself. (laughs)

309
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,856
So, Professor,
tell me all about last night.

310
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,105
Dish-dish-dish!

311
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,906
Uh, yes, well, I can't talk now.

312
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,200
I'm on a date. And then I have a date.

313
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,704
{\an8}And then another date.

314
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,206
Is there such a thing
as too much of a good thing?

315
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,249
This is my cousin, Nookie Kwan.

316
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,332
I'm number one on the east side.

317
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,038
(quietly) Oh, gah-layvin.

318
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,428
-Have any of you seen John Frink?
-He ain't here.

319
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,799
But his hover-tronic
Frink-a-ma-car is parked outside.

320
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,388
Hey, if I say he ain't here,
he ain't here.

321
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:54,233
{\an8}Hey, Moe,
there's a rat floating in my beer.

322
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,060
It ain't there.

323
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,185
-(door closes)
-Thank you, my good man,

324
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,232
but, uh, I saw some
terrible things down there.

325
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,237
Like for one, Moe is pantsless.

326
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,200
Hey, it's apron-only Tuesday.

327
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,360
Oi...

328
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,118
You're a lucky guy, Frinky.

329
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,119
Got all the chicks you want
while I can't find a single woman

330
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:15,122
to put up with me
and my domesticated wolverine.

331
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,535
-Lucky Frink.
-I got nothin'.

332
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,214
Some guys get all the breaks.

333
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,712
Let me see here.

334
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,093
Uh, needy men...

335
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,590
plus lonely women...

336
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,551
I-I just bring them together!

337
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,222
Hey, that's some nice thinkin' there.

338
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,220
Now, how 'bout a beer and a baked potato.

339
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,722
Ah, that sounds nice.

340
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,473
We don't serve baked potatoes.

341
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,220
What happened?

342
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,478
Everyone is incredibly depressed.

343
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,444
-(groans)
-(sighs)

344
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,904
(electronic sigh)

345
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,244
I admit the hallucinations
were getting out of hand,

346
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,780
so I stopped the meds.

347
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:51,083
And hid them in the one place
they'll never look-- the library.

348
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,448
Well, there's one thing
you didn't count on--

349
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:57,575
I go there because it's the only room
in this building with heat.

350
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,672
(Marge gasps)

351
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,590
Grampa, you're not allowed
to take dangerous drugs

352
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,420
unless they're in a little paper cup.

353
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:08,175
Listen here. Every night I watch
my roommate cry himself to sleep.

354
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,758
Yesterday I found out it was a mirror!

355
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,854
I'm gonna find my Mona!

356
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,140
(grunting)

357
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,483
There's a lesson here--
never visit Grampa.

358
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,231
(gasps)

359
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,613
My old car.

360
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,532
Oh, that's some fine hallucinatin'.

361
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:31,371

before polio was cured!

It's America the way I liked it,

365
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,681
before we went to the moon
and discovered how boring it was.

366
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,598
(laughing)

367
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,812
I found the one happy moment
in 80 years of life,

368
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,443
and I ain't leavin' it.

369
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
Oh, this ain't right.

370
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,145
(snaps) That's better!

371
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,152
This ends right now!

372
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:10,364
She's not real. None of this is real.

373
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,366
Imaginary cigarettes?
Nonexistent candy?

374
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,909
(stammering)
Get outta here, Marge!

375
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,203
Unescorted women like you
aren't allowed in this era!

376
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,328
I'm not getting out, I'm cutting in.

377
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,705
You can't live here.

378
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,671
You have people
in the real world who love you.

379
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,013
Two are standing right over here.

380
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,668
If you live in the past,
you'll never have us.

381
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,838
And what's more precious to a grampa
than his grandchildren?

382
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,927
Particularly his grandson.

383
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:40,434
Aw, your sexist argument has won me over.

384
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,597
We women will have our day.

385
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,186
{\an8}-Attaboy.
-(groans)

386
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,572
Good-bye, Mona.

387
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,068
And good-bye,
pack of cigarettes for a quarter.

388
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,741
I think I'll miss you the most.

389
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,567
(gasps)

390
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,121
So what, uh, all that dancin' around
with me meant nothin'?

391
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,463
(chuckles)
Oh, I'll be back to steal a kiss later.

392
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,869
And as for you...

393
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,287
I've got more involved plans.

394
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,796
(groans)

395
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,089
So, Frink is finally
going to announce which woman

396
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,434
he's chosen to be with
at the Springfield Planetarium.

397
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,391
It's like an episode of <i>The Bachelor,</i>

398
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,101
but you drive there
and pay six dollars for parking.

399
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,022
Why are we both explaining it
if we all know what's happening?

400
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,562
I like talking to you.

401
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,235
(normal voice)
Ladies, please pay attention here.

402
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,911
(groaning, murmuring)

403
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:39,909
You see, I, uh... I thought
I was the only one who was lonely.

404
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,913
But I have learned
that loneliness is everywhere,

405
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,616
like superhero movies.

406
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,496
How many times can Batman begin?

407
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,415
I have reworked my algorithms

408
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,094
to make you not like me,

409
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,842
but to find the man that will
make each of you happiest, yes.

410
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,926
Uh, release the bachelors!

411
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,101
I hope they enjoy it.

412
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,845

Duffman would love to be taught

415
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,609
how to speak in the first-person.

416
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,321
(chuckling) Everyone's paired up.

417
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,282
Almost everyone's paired up.

418
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,120
Professor, what about you?
Where's your match?

419
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,489
For me, my true love
is intellectual conquest,

420
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,708
the-the music of the spheres.

421
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,118

422
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:29,126

Why did I build a mother?

Oi, goy-vick.

how come we're all back here?
