if you can teach one kid
one thing,

then today will be a success.

{\an8}You’re children.

46
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,413
{\an8}Why do you all need cell phones?

47
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,997
-Safety.
-Emergencies.

00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,792
-Safety.
-Educational.

49
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:51,296
{\an8}(sighs) Could you at least
set them to vibrate?

50
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:55,179
{\an8}(loud vibrating)

00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,718

No more gizmos in this class.

the knowledge in your own head.

Hey, don’t worry.

00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,043
We still have the good old

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,049
{\an8}Better. Thanks.

{\an8}How could Krabappel
take my cell phone?

69
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:46,517
{\an8}I’m only on month one
of a 60-month plan.

70
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,481
{\an8}You know, Krabappel
just needs to chill out

71
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,981
{\an8}and realize life is cool--
but how?

72
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,864
{\an8}(Homer giggling)

73
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,954
{\an8}(drunkenly):
Okay. Now I’ll be the dog,

74
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,911
{\an8}and you be the daddy.

{\an8}Hmm. You know,

78
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,844
{\an8}my dad is a lot more fun
after a few beers.

79
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,969
{\an8}Maybe Mrs. K would be nicer
if we "Irish up" her coffee.

80
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,008
Put blood in it?

81
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,761
No, booze.

82
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,052
{\an8}First the easy part.

83
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,755
{\an8}Kids, get some liquor.

84
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:26,635

Sugar Plum Fairy" plays)

90
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,520
What if she
tastes the booze?

91
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,105
Relax.

92
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,820

Ah.

95

And that’s why I found
<i>Good Night, Gorilla</i>

96
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,946

summer beach read.

97

Two stars for you.

98
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,831
And an extra,

99
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:33,752

can’t protect you from this.

I’ll get you

-Never!
-Edna, let’s go.

we went too far?
-Nah.

I’m so sorry.

126
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,427
I really don’t know
what happened.

127
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,061
You made quite a nanny goat
of yourself yesterday.

128
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,719
I know I did,
but I don’t know why.

129

thing I’ve ever had to do,

130

131

Seymour...

132
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,149
I’m going to cry.

133
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,862
Here. Take my hanky.

134
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,405
I’m working on my magic act
for the Faculty Follies.

135
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,200
But right now,
I don’t feel much like follying.

136
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,536
Could I have a moment alone?

137
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,081
Of course.

138
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,916
There’s a form to extend your
health insurance on my desk.

139
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,635
I never wanted
her to get fired.

140
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,429
I bet it was that hamster
medicine we added

141
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,183
that put her
over the edge.

142
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,385
Maybe I should tell Skinner
that it was our...

143
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,057
Needle scratch!

144
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,935
My name is Zachary Vaughn.

145
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,522
I just got my masters
in education

146
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,648
from Tufts University,
and you are my first class ever.

147
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,486
An M.E.D. from Tufts?

148
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,031
Nice.

149
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,954
But why talk when I could text?

150
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,115
-Our cell phones!
-Our Blueteeth!

151
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,914

153
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,343
STUDENTS:
Whoa!

154
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,421
That text was totally worth

155
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,797
the 15 cents it cost
to receive it.

156
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,045
<i>BART: Then, Zach Skyped us,</i>

157
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,256
live-blogged our
spelling bee

158
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,136
and friended us
on Facebook.

159
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,983
I thought you were studying
the Lincoln-Douglas debates.

160
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,979
You mean the L Man/D Dog
flame wars.

161
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,771
(groans)

162
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,364
I’m glad you’ve got
such a stimulating substitute,

163
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,150
but I’m worried
about Mrs. Krabappel.

164
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,904
Oh, no worries.

165
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,395
I heard on the four-square
court she’s doing great.

166
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,698
No one even plays
four-square anymore.

167
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,952
They just gossip.

168
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,200
Ah...

169
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,082
All right.

170
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,995
Who can tell me
what the Monroe Doctrine was?

171
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,835
Oh, oh!

172
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,590
The policy of President Monroe
that America

173
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,972
-has the right as a nation to...
-Wait, wait, wait.

174
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,719
Are you telling me
you memorized that fact

175
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,141
when anyone with a cell phone
can find it out in 30 seconds?

176
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,761
I-I...

177
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,677
I’ve crammed my head
full of garbage!

178
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,847
Yes, you have.

179
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:23,903
What are these?

180
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,360
Those are smiley stickers.

181
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,819
Mrs. Krabappel used to put them
on our papers

182
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,440
as a reward for good work.

183
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,027
I run a paperless classroom.

184
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,282
Check this out.

185
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:36,953
But this is just
nonsense punctuation.

186
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,293
Oh, my God!

187
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,121
Anybody want to return
these caveman kudos

188
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,747
to Mrs. Krabappel?

189
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,924
Uh, sure.
It’s sort of on my way home.

190
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,633
I can check up on the old girl.

191
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:52,803
She probably landed a job at
some fancy-schmancy prep school.

192
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,925
Make way for the new freshman.

193
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,933
Where do I find the books,
the booze and the broads?

194
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,557
Hey, Dean, how about
a little privacy?

195
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,404
I’ve got to matriculate.

196
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,649
(laughs halfheartedly)

197
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,771
-(doorbell rings)
-Door’s broken.

198
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,777
Mrs. K, is everything
all right?

199
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,280
Sure. (coughs)

200
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,031
Never better.

201
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,373
(hacking)

202
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,029
I know, Bart.

203
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,327
It’s pretty sad to see
your teacher fallen so low.

204
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,122
(laughing)

205
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,075
It’s the movie.
It’s so funny.

206
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,883
Sir, this is a benefit to
increase our endowment.

207
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,054
Honey, if we increase
your endowment any more,

208
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,553
we’ll all be in the shade.

209
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,095
Hey, you’re all right.

210
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,309
Hey, everyone,
dessert’s on me.

211
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,469
(chuckles)

212
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,177
(laughing)

213
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,977
Sorry. Sorry.

214
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,607
Thanks for bringing over
the smiley stickers, Bart.

215
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,276
They really liven
the place up.

216
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,405
Mrs. K, you’ve got
to get out of here.

217
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,992
When was the last time
you washed your hair?

218
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,947
Hmm. Two weeks ago?

219
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,407
Well, that’s better than me,

220
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,247
but still,
you’ve got to get out.

221
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,752
What’s the point?

222
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,383
Out of work, I’m out of money.

223
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,000
No man wants me,
except Disco Stu.

224
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,337
Disco Stu is about more
than just disco.

225
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,973
I’m also-- ha! --

226
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,050
super Christian!

227
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,967
Okay, look, there’s a big
football game on tonight,

228
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,716
so we can get this thing
over real quick.

229
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,268
Show me some of Bart’s artwork,
give me a little false hope,

230
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,312
and here’s a little something
to help with his grades.

231
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,107
I’m not asking for A’s,
just incompletes.

232
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,071
Mr. Simpson, I don’t
need your money.

233
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,951
Bart can definitely be
a challenge,

234
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,818
but, yeah, I like challenges,
and he...

235
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,565
(laughing):
...he’s got a wild sense
of humor.

236
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,117
Look at this picture he drew.

237
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,330
(laughs)

238
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,870
It will be his last birthday

239
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,623
if he keeps drawing pictures
like this.

240
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,615
-What?
-I said,
are there any areas

241
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,127
that we, his parents,
can improve upon?

242
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,799
Yes. Just one: relax.

243
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,878
You’re clearly
a caring father.

244
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,217
(crying)

245
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,050
You’re the first teacher
that ever got me.

246
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,467
(crying)

247
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,055
Let it out. Let it out.

248
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,101

249
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,595

(very loud sobbing)

251
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,698
Keep it in. Keep it in.

252
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,699
(very loud sobbing)

253
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,504
Two hot chocolates
with hot fudge boost.

254
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,209
Milhouse... (sighs)

255
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,619
...we ruined Edna’s life.

256
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,287
Maybe we can get her job back.

257
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,785
But we can’t lose Zach.

258
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,797
Look at the awesome video

"This book uses

300
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,196
That makes absolutely no sense.

301
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,865
Hey. "Just because
we don’t understand electricity,

00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,254

00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,684
Look, Mrs. K, I’m a Simpson,

313
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,024
So, did you write

"index card of fate"?

315
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,860
Yes, but it still seems...

322
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,964
Bart, this is starting to sound

323
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,921
like one of those loony
self-help books.

324
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,051
Loony? Would a loony self-help
book come with a magic

325
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,049
question mark inside?

326
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,511
Huh? Huh? Huh?

327
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,763
All thanks to <i>The Answer!</i>

328
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,506
Well, opening this store
was a lot of work,

329
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,308
but your faith in me
got me through it.

330
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,191
And it looks like

331
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,518
you got your own
index card of fate.

332
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,983
-What’s your dream?
-Nothing, nothing.

333

What did he want?

338
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,665
Beats me.

339
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,288
I just gave him a banana.

340
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,785
Well, thanks again, Bart.

341
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,746
This store has definitely
turned my life around.

342
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,047
Yup. I’m off the hook now.

343
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,421
What do you mean by that?

344
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,128
Well, I guess I can tell you,

345
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,218
’cause everything worked out
for the best.

346
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,814

348
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,641
Well, it’s funny, really.

349
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,896
I’m the one
who put booze in your coffee

350
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,809

352
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,692
You did what?!

353
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,315
Please don’t kill me.

354
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,080
You ruined my life!

355
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,578
It’s your fault I have to work
at this stupid muffin store.

356
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,331
But this place
was your dream!

357
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,463
My real dream was
to be a teacher,

358
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,330
and you got me fired!

359
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,627
Now I’m up to my eyeballs
in debt with this stupid store,

360
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,972
and four more muffin stores
just opened on this block!

361
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,024
No!

362
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,939
But-But-But you found
<i>The Answer!</i>

363
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:04,188
No! I wrote a phone number
in there!

364
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,073
No matter what you’ve done,
I always thought

365
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,321
there was a spark of decency
in you, Bart Simpson,

366
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,823
but I was wrong.

367
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,164
I never thought
I’d say this to a child,

368
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,950
but you are bad
on the inside.

369
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,116
(gasps)

370
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,082
(humming)

371
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,035
Dad, am I bad on the inside?

372
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,126
No... but the layers of bad
on your surface

373
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,922
go almost all the way
to the center.

374
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:32,466
But you think there’s, like, a
kernel of good inside me, right?

375
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,091
Hmm. I don’t know.

376
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,598
Kernels are kind of big.

377
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,349
Oh! Listen, I was thinking.

378
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,021
If someone did a really
bad thing to one teacher,

379
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,863
and then did the same bad
thing to another teacher

380
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,979
to get the first teacher her
job back, would it be okay?

381
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,528
When you say teacher,
do you really mean parent?

382
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,492
No, I mean teacher.

383
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,072
Great. Go nuts.

384
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,277
But remember, we never
had this discussion.

385
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,037
What discussion?

386
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,409
The one we just had

387
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,916
about you doing bad things,
you stupid kid!

388
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,628
Oh.

389
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,359
So, you see,
it was my fault.

390
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,824
I got Mrs. Krabappel drunk.

391
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,954
Then I was gonna do
the same thing to Zack,

392
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,031
but I decided it was better
to just tell the truth.

393
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,997
Bart, you deserve a reward
for telling the truth.

394
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,119
And that reward will be in
the form of a severe punishment.

395
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,877
Doesn’t matter, as long
as Edna gets her job back.

396
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,500
Sorry, Bart, but I can’t just
get rid of a teacher

397
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,087
if he’s doing a good job.

398
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,512
Or an adequate job.

399
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,630
Or just shows up
and doesn’t touch anyone.

400
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,717
ZACK (chanting):
I hate children!

401
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,433
I hate children!

402
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,273
Children suck!
Children suck!

403
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:07,149
What the...? Faculty lounge talk
out in the halls?!

404
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,319
I hate children!
I hate children!

405
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,819
You and you and you
and you and you!

406
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,741
(slurring his speech):
You are wasting your lives.

407
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,950
Hilary Swank didn’t graduate
high school.

408
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,410
She won two Oscars.

409
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,450
And one of them she deserved.

410
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,245
Bart, you said you
<i>didn’t </i>get him drunk.

411
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,158
I didn’t. I swear!

412
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,617
No, he’s right.

413
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,957
I mixed a little vodka
in with my Blue Bronco.

414
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:33,342
Does anybody else want
to ride the indigo pony!

415
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,052
Is there extra credit in it?

416
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,262
Oh, they’re gonna eat you alive
at Cal Tech, boy.

417
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,183
