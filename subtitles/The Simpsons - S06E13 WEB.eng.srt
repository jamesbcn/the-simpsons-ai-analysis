1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,547
The Simpsons.

2
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,869
We now return to
Knightboat, the crime-solving boat.

3
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,580
Faster, Knightboat. We've got
to catch those starfish poachers.

4
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:41,041
You don't have to yell,
Michael. I'm all around you.

5
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,127
Oh, no! They're headed
for land.

6
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,507
We'll never catch them now.

7
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,551
Incorrect.
Look! A canal.

8
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,053
Go, Knightboat, go!

9
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,055
Oh, every week
there's a canal.

10
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,182
- Or an inlet.
- Or a fjord.

11
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,101
Quiet! I will not hear
another word against the boat.

12
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,228
Okay, TV off...
It's family time.

13
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,022
Oh, but, Marge!

14
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:07,776
Knightboat...
The crime-solving boat.

15
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,694
Homer, you promised...

16
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,362
One night of
family time a week.

17
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,491
Besides, that back-talking boat
sets a bad example.

18
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,784
Says you, woman.

19
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,747
All right, family
time begins now.

20
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,049
Homer!

21
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,592
It was Bart.

22
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,275
Why don't we all look
at the photo album?

23
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,221
So many memories.

24
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,972
Ah, look...

25
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,140
Knightboat.

26
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,229
And here's our TV
next to the mirror.

27
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,689
It looks like
we have two.

28
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,359
- Wow. Two.
- Wow. Two.

29
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,693
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Two.

30
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,779
Let's get to
the baby pictures.

31
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,573
That's exciting.

32
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,534
Oh, please.

33
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,456
Here's Bart sleeping.

34
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,125
Here he is dozing.

35
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,002
Here he is after a
visit from the sandman.

36
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,755
Ooh, here's nappy-time, Bart.

37
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,508
Here's a cute one...
He's all tuckered out.

38
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,343
Why aren't there any
pictures of Maggie?

39
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,638
Well, I'm glad
you asked.

40
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,141
It's actually a very
interesting story.

41
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:26,604
It all began about two years ago
before Maggie was even born.

42
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,439
Bart, you were Lisa's age.

43
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:32,110
And Lisa, you were... The age
Bart was several years ago.

44
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,570
Get the camera ready.

45
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,196
Bart very sleepy.

46
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,699
Listen carefully, and my
words will shape images

47
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,909
as clear as any TV show.

48
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,871
It was a tumultuous time
for our nation.

49
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:46,124
The clear beverage craze
gave us all a reason to live.

50
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,127
The information superhighway
showed the average person

51
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,296
what some nerd thinks
about Star Trek

52
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:56,551
and the domestication of
the dog continued unabated.

53
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,179
I was at my workstation
when suddenly...

54
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,972
Attention, American workers.

55
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:04,434
Your plant has been taken over
by an all-star team

56
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,687
of freelance terrorists.

57
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,689
Not on my shift!

58
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,991
Oh, no, you don't.

59
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,204
Simpson 10, terrorists 8.

60
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,666
Homer, tell the story right.

61
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,043
Okay.

62
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,049
Homer, you should
see a doctor.

63
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,508
I don't think
a healthy man

64
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,927
can make that kind
of smell.

65
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,053
Your paychecks,
gentlemen.

66
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,932
Whoo-hoo!

67
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,350
This is it.

68
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,477
With this single,
glorious check

69
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,480
I'm finally
completely out of debt!

70
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,904
Yes! With my bills paid off

71
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,156
I can finally quit
this lousy job.

72
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,533
But Homer, how you going
to make a living?

73
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,285
Don't worry
about Homer J.

74
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,079
I've got a plan...

75
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,665
A plan that will
fix you good.

76
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,958
Hey, what did we do?

77
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,334
Sorry. That just
slipped out.

78
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,919
I'll miss you.

79
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,712
Did you hear me?

80
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,965
I said I quit, Monty!

81
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,176
And since I quit,
I can do anything I want.

82
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,678
Is that so?

83
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,805
Ooh, lovely desk.

84
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,181
It would be too bad
if someone...

85
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,558
Oh, I don't know...

86
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,061
Didn't use a coaster!

87
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,232
Such a nice, tidy office.

88
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,526
Maybe it's time you
started living like a pig!

89
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:43,992
Oh, I hope I haven't
upset you... Bongo head!

90
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:52,041
Oh, I should be resisting this,
but I'm paralyzed with rage.

91
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,751
And island rhythms.

92
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,966
Yeah! Way to play the boss's
head like a bongo, Homer.

93
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,176
He's getting a pretty good
sound out of that guy.

94
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:04,762
And... uh!

95
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,223
Ee! Ooh! Ow! Uh!

96
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,143
That's for employing me
for eight years!

97
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,941
And that is that.

98
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:21,863
Good-bye, mind-numbing,
backbreaking labor forever.

99
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,574
Hello, dream job in paradise.

100
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,583
And now,
the final phase of my plan.

101
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,380
Hey, Barney, any chance
you can get me a job here?

102
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,757
Oh, sure, Homer.

103
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,343
I told you, my uncle
owns the place.

104
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,888
Hey, Uncle Al,
can Homer have a job?

105
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,806
- Sure.
- Whoo-hoo!

106
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:51,892
Barney,
you're fired.

107
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,186
Okay.

108
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,063
Show up tomorrow.
Bring three rags.

109
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,856
Oh, and a change
of pants.

110
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,900
- Why?
- When it happens, you'll know.

111
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,653
You're a pin monkey?

112
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,156
Wow. Finally I don't
have to be ashamed

113
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,532
of my father's job.

114
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,159
I think it's romantic,

115
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,012
throwing off your shackles
of the workday world

116
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,038
and following a dream...
Of sorts.

117
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,290
I don't know if it's
such a good idea.

118
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,167
Can we get by on
a pin monkey's salary?

119
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,919
Don't worry, Marge.

120
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,755
I've come up with
a perfectly balanced budget.

121
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,757
There will be exactly
enough money

122
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,385
for you, me,
Bart and Lisa,

123
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,970
if we make a few
small sacrifices.

124
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,976
From now on, we use
regular toilet paper

125
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,479
not that fancy quilted kind.

126
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,566
And only one of you kids
can go to college.

127
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,110
- Fine.
- Fine.

128
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:44,987
That night
your mother and I

129
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,323
went out for
a romantic evening

130
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,242
to celebrate the start
of our new life.

131
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,494
We began
with dinner and dancing.

132
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,121
At the Copa.

133
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,706
Copacabana.

134
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,126
The hottest spot
north of Havana.

135
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,836
At the Copa...

136
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,757
Followed by a stroll
on the beach.

137
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,265
Marge.

138
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,891
Homer.

139
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,727
I've got sand
in my underpants.

140
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,479
Me too. Let's go home.

141
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,919
I love you, Marge.

142
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,255
I love you, too, Homey.

143
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,882
Everything in our lives

144
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,759
is finally
perfectly balanced.

145
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,721
I hope things stay
exactly like this forever.

146
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,856
Whoo-hoo!

147
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,611
Did you have
to be so graphic?

148
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,070
It's okay, Marge.

149
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,573
They pave the way for this
kind of filth in school.

150
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,867
So Dad, were you excited
that Mom was pregnant?

151
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,911
Actually, your mother
hadn't told me yet.

152
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,539
At that time, I had no idea
Maggie even existed.

153
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,666
- Dad!
- Dad!

154
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:22,793
Hi, Maggie.

155
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:29,675
So, anyhoo, back then there
was no way for me to know

156
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,053
your mother was pregnant.

157
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,850
Marge, you tie up
the bathroom every morning.

158
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,310
I've got to wash my hair.

159
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:42,188
The next few weeks
at my dream job

160
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,398
were like a wonderful
waking coma.

161
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,611
Hey, Homer.

162
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,922
- Hi there, Homer.
- Hi there, Homer.

163
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,364
- Hi, Homer.
- Hi, there, Homer.

164
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,865
Hi.

165
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,204
Mmm, bowling fresh.

166
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,295
Mmm, urinal fresh.

167
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:21,185
Homer, did you polish your head
in the Shine-o Ball-o?

168
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,853
- No.
- Okay, then.

169
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,481
Whoo!

170
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,358
I slowly learned

171
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,443
the intricate mysteries
of the alley,

172
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,529
like where the pins go
after they're knocked down.

173
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,175
I was in heaven.

174
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,469
If horse racing
is the sport of kings,

175
00:09:55,553 --> 00:10:00,266
then surely bowling is
a very good sport as well.

176
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,559
Hey, great job, Homer.

177
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,768
Thanks a lot, Homer.

178
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,478
Hey, you're the best.

179
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:09,817
I'm gonna make
it after all.

180
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,072
Congratulations, Mrs. Simpson.
You're pregnant.

181
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,035
Am I to take it
that this is...

182
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,121
...an unwanted pregnancy?

183
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,832
Oh, no, no,
not exactly.

184
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,834
It's just that I
haven't told Homer yet.

185
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,878
And with his new job,

186
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,897
I don't know how we're
going to be able to afford this.

187
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:35,134
Well, you know, a healthy baby
can bring upwards of $60,000.

188
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,970
- What?
- Well, of course, that was just a test.

189
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,723
Had you reacted differently,
why, you'd be in jail right now.

190
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,932
Simply a test.

191
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,561
So in a few months,

192
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,897
both of you will have
a brand new brother or sister.

193
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,273
Been there.
Done that.

194
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,608
I hope it's a girl.

195
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,360
You know nothing
about genetics, Lis.

196
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,654
It goes boy, girl, boy, girl.

197
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,822
You're worried about telling Dad,
aren't you, Mom?

198
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,491
Why do you say that?

199
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,160
Well, you've been in my room
for about four hours now.

200
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,912
Hey, I'm just hanging.

201
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,045
Homey, I...

202
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,673
Can't talk. Praying.

203
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,384
Dear Lord, the gods
have been good to me,

204
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,885
and I am thankful.

205
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,762
For the first time in my life,

206
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,933
everything is absolutely
perfect just the way it is.

207
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,727
So here's the deal.

208
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,521
You freeze everything as it is,

209
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,564
and I won't ask
for anything more.

210
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,149
If that is okay,

211
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,567
please give me
absolutely no sign.

212
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,027
Okay, deal.

213
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,363
In gratitude,
I present you this offering

214
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,864
of cookies and milk.

215
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,308
If you want me
to eat them for you,

216
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,492
give me no sign.

217
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,369
Thy will be done.

218
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,457
Oogie-boogie-boogie-
boogie-boogie-boo.

219
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,793
Oogie-boogie-
boogie-boogie-boo.

220
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,548
I've got to tell Homer
about this baby

221
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,426
in just the right way
and at just the right time.

222
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,470
Until then, please,
keep this to yourselves.

223
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,681
Oh, if he found out now,

224
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,224
it would probably
destroy him, huh?

225
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,976
Oh, yes.

226
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,352
- Gotta go.
- Gotta go.

227
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,230
Wait a minute! Wait!
I know that look.

228
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,190
Now, promise you
won't tell Homer.

229
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,694
Oh, we promise
we won't tell... Homer.

230
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,744
Hello, is this
A. Aaronson?

231
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,370
It might interest you to know

232
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,206
that Marge Simpson
is pregnant again.

233
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,129
Just thought you'd like
to know, Mr. Zakowski.

234
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,047
There.

235
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:40,384
Aaronson and Zakowski are
the two biggest gossips in town.

236
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,721
In an hour,
everyone will know.

237
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,724
Ah, another perfect day
in my perfect life

238
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,602
with my perfect job.

239
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,396
Hey, just heard the news
over the squawk box.

240
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,564
That's nice work,
Homer.

241
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,982
Thank you!

242
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:58,360
Thank you very much.
It is nice work.

243
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,946
Oh, Mr. Simpson,
I have just heard

244
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,448
about the little
bundle of joy.

245
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,909
- Congratulations, sir.
- It's true.

246
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:08,370
The bundle is little,
but I'm not in it for the money.

247
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,540
Hey, Homer!

248
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,334
Way to get Marge pregnant.

249
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,630
This is getting very abstract,
but thank you.

250
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,090
I do enjoy working
at the bowling alley.

251
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:25,054
Surprise!
Baby shower!

252
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,597
Baby shower?

253
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,557
You know I haven't
told Homer yet,

254
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,476
and he'll be home any minute.

255
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,685
- Oh, really?
- Oh, really?

256
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,943
Man, it's windy
as hell out there.

257
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,028
Hey, wait a minute.

258
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,113
What are all these presents?

259
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:47,535
It looks like you're
showering Marge with gifts.

260
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:53,457
With little tiny,
baby-sized gifts.

261
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,876
Well, I'll be in the tub.

262
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,420
By the way,

263
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,548
congratulations
on your new job, Homer.

264
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,383
New job?

265
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,385
Marge is pregnant?

266
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,179
No!

267
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,476
Wow, Dad. You really
threw a tantrum

268
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,894
like a little
sissy girl?

269
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,354
Oh, just that one time.

270
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,690
Actually, when I was about
to have Bart...

271
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,984
You're pregnant?

272
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,990
And then when I told him
about Lisa...

273
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,283
You're pregnant again?

274
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,581
Well, who wouldn't be upset?

275
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,332
That new baby
in your mother's womb

276
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,917
was a ticking time bomb

277
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,378
threatening to blow this family
eight ways from Sunday.

278
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,422
Hey, where are you going?

279
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,341
Dad, you can't expect a person
to sit for 30 minutes straight.

280
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,386
I'm going to get a snack
and maybe go to the bathroom.

281
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,905
I'll stay here,
but I'm going to think

282
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,056
about products I might
like to purchase.

283
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,104
Ooh... I don't have that.

284
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,192
Oh... You're pregnant!

285
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,569
We're gonna have
to have a baby.

286
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,572
All our financial
plans are ruined.

287
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,656
We're doomed.

288
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,117
Doomed, I tells ya!

289
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,786
Pow!

290
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,222
Bart, let your father
tell the story.

291
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,372
Yeah.

292
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,166
Okay, but I know funny.

293
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,751
Anyhoo...

294
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,502
We're doomed.

295
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,547
- Homer, you had a head.
- Check.

296
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,031
And your bottom
was a little bigger.

297
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,469
You've worked hard
at the bowling alley.

298
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,179
Why don't you ask
for a raise?

299
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,764
Yeah, a raise.

300
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,325
I've never been good
enough at any job

301
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,558
to deserve one before,

302
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,644
but I'm damn good
at this one.

303
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,897
That's it. I'm going to march
right up to Al and say...

304
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,565
Steve... I mean, Al,

305
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,567
I think I deserve
a raise.

306
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,735
You're a hard worker,

307
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,362
and I'd like to give
you a raise,

308
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,405
but the alley just ain't
doing enough business

309
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,074
to pay that kind
of money.

310
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,576
How about if I
triple the business?

311
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,536
Then could I get a raise?

312
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,788
Well, yeah, but...

313
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,023
Of course.

314
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,568
Bowling. Bowling here.

315
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,112
Come bowl now.

316
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,238
Get your bowling.

317
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,407
Who's ready? Bowling.

318
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,993
Mom, make Dad tell
the story right.

319
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,285
That's what
really happened.

320
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,664
My marketing
plan attracted

321
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,833
a record number of police
and fire officials,

322
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,751
but few stayed to bowl.

323
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,336
I failed.

324
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,005
Quitting my dream job

325
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,590
was the hardest thing
I've ever done.

326
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,676
You did
a great job, Homer,

327
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,903
and I'm really
gonna miss you.

328
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,595
The place has never
been cleaner.

329
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,472
And the way you kept
the young people away...

330
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,224
That was beautiful.

331
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,520
Anyway, we all pitched in,
and we got you

332
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,730
this little
going-away thing.

333
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,155
This was the happiest time
of my life.

334
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:15,868
I'll never forget you guys,
especially you, Joey.

335
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,327
See you around, Mr. Homer.

336
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,829
Don't worry, Joey.

337
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,165
We'll make it
to California someday.

338
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,708
Sure we will, Mr. Homer.

339
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,791
Sure we will.

340
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,588
It's going to be
sad around here

341
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,339
without you, Homer.

342
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,554
Boy, this is depressing.

343
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,437
Hey, I know what would
cheer us up... Bowling.

344
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,520
Look at this.
I got a ball here.

345
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,064
I'm cheered up.

346
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,399
Hey, this is fun.

347
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,652
I needed more money
to support my growing family,

348
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,529
and there was only
one place in town

349
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,823
that a man like me
could make it.

350
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,883
Uh-oh. Acid rain again.

351
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,693
Yes? Are you
a new applicant?

352
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,822
Actually, I quit,
and I came to get my job back.

353
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:35,906
Through there.

354
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:47,501
So, come crawling back, eh?

355
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,211
Seems like
the classy thing to do

356
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,588
would be not to call
attention to it.

357
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,299
Thanks for giving me
my old job back.

358
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,844
I'm afraid it's
not that simple.

359
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,846
As punishment
for your desertion,

360
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,141
it's company policy
to give you the plague.

361
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,059
Uh, sir, that's the "plaque."

362
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,938
Ah, yes, the special
demotivational plaque

363
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,983
to break what's left
of your spirit.

364
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:14,528
Because, you see,
you're here forever.

365
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,168
I've never been so miserable
in all my life,

366
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,212
but I can't take it out
on Marge and the kids.

367
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,465
I've got to carry
the burden all by myself.

368
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,177
Hi, Honey.
How are you?

369
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,553
Well, actually...

370
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,930
Oh, I can't go on with
this charade any longer.

371
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,724
I hate my job.
I hate my life.

372
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,368
And ever since I found out
about this baby,

373
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,661
there's been nothing
but bad luck.

374
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,104
My contractions started
an hour ago.

375
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,065
It's just in one ear and out the other
with you, isn't it Marge?

376
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,819
This is incredible.

377
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,946
It's God's most
wondrous miracle.

378
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,574
Sir, I think your wife
wants to hold the baby.

379
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,868
My wife?
Where? Where?

380
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,623
Congratulations.
It's a boy.

381
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:11,376
Arr! You're truly
the catch of the day.

382
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,463
It's wonderful.
It's magical.

383
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:18,258
Oh, boy, here it comes...
Another mouth.

384
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,053
One more push should do it.

385
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,638
Marvelous.

386
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,143
Congratulations, Mr. Simpson.

387
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,062
You have a beautiful,
healthy baby.

388
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,189
Okay.

389
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,071
Homey, I think someone
is saying hello.

390
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,364
Hello.

391
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,911
It's a boy,
and what a boy!

392
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,996
Uh... That's
the umbilical cord.

393
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,790
It's a girl.

394
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,750
A girl.

395
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,087
Oh, Marge, we have
a wonderful baby girl.

396
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,838
Not just a girl...

397
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,676
The most beautiful baby girl
in the whole world.

398
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,305
Come on, Marge,
show a little enthusiasm.

399
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,482
So you loved her
right from the start.

400
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,902
Absolutely.

401
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,153
Then why no pictures?

402
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,406
Oh, there are pictures.

403
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,659
I keep them where I need
the most cheering up.
