1
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:17,903
Riot Rivers!

2
00:00:21,744 --> 00:00:24,048
Riot Rivers!

3
00:00:24,115 --> 00:00:25,785
Honey, are you in there?

4
00:00:25,852 --> 00:00:26,987
Yes.

5
00:00:27,054 --> 00:00:29,158
Riot Rivers!

6
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:32,164
Ri-ot Riv-ers! Ri-ot Riv-ers!

7
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:33,901
There it is! Turn!

8
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:35,470
Calm down!

9
00:00:35,538 --> 00:00:37,117
I'm not gonna miss
your stupid water park.

10
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:38,678
It's not stupid.

11
00:00:38,744 --> 00:00:41,584
Riot Rivers was the
greatest summer job I ever had.

12
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,790
Getting paid to watch people
of all ages eat it,

13
00:00:44,856 --> 00:00:46,359
again and again.

14
00:00:46,426 --> 00:00:49,031
Just eatin' it so hard!

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,422
Wait a minute.

16
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:04,061
They did a documentary
about this place.

17
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:11,309
No, it didn't
happen that way.

18
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:13,413
There was different music.

19
00:01:18,824 --> 00:01:20,227
Quiet Rivers?!

20
00:01:20,293 --> 00:01:22,799
They changed the "ruh"
to a "qwah."

21
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:24,368
Did you know about this?

22
00:01:24,435 --> 00:01:26,807
I told you they changed the name
before we left.

23
00:01:26,874 --> 00:01:28,978
I thought you were joking.

24
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:30,815
That's the problem
with you, Marge.

25
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,786
You're always kidding around.

26
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,768
Come on!

27
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:44,241
See? They turned all the super
cool rides into baby rides.

28
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:45,778
And the teens working here...

29
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:47,725
They're not even laughing
at the kids wiping out.

30
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:49,485
They're loading them in
feet first.

31
00:01:49,553 --> 00:01:51,824
Hey! Where are your cutoffs?

32
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,527
Are you even high?

33
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:56,567
There's nothing worse
in this universe

34
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:58,971
than a ride steering wheel
that does nothing.

35
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:00,373
No, it does something.

36
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,779
It makes the frog smile.

37
00:02:06,152 --> 00:02:08,724
Oh, man, swim diapers.

38
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,595
I remember those.

39
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:12,297
True freedom.

40
00:02:12,364 --> 00:02:15,337
I could tell you some stories.

41
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,988
Can we leave yet?
Can we leave yet?

42
00:02:24,054 --> 00:02:25,323
Aw, you kids don't know,

43
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,562
but this place
used to be so bitchin'.

44
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:30,133
And the best slide of all
was right over there.

45
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,570
Think of it.

46
00:02:31,637 --> 00:02:34,141
90% of all hospitalizations

47
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,279
off just one ride!

48
00:02:36,345 --> 00:02:38,851
I wonder...

49
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,830
It's still here.

50
00:02:44,896 --> 00:02:48,136
The Devil's Deluge had
the longest lines,

51
00:02:48,203 --> 00:02:51,777
the scariest turns,
even its own ambulance!

52
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:55,785
Hello, my love.

53
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:58,189
Did you miss me?

54
00:03:01,563 --> 00:03:02,599
Wow.

55
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:04,268
Looks dry.

56
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:06,138
And dangerous.

57
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:13,019
Children, behold the deluge.

58
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:15,290
For today,
we punch fear in the face

59
00:03:15,357 --> 00:03:17,595
and steal death's girlfriend,

60
00:03:17,662 --> 00:03:20,902
as we truly live
for the first time.

61
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,778
Also, this is
now the only way down.

62
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:36,631
O-possums!

63
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,236
Oh, man, I saw my life flash
before my eyes.

64
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:57,341
I've had an awesome life.

65
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:03,186
Oh, look at those smiles.

66
00:04:03,252 --> 00:04:06,058
I knew
you guys could have fun here.

67
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,229
Yeah, nothing gets
the heart pumping

68
00:04:08,296 --> 00:04:10,901
like a brush with... nothing.

69
00:04:12,538 --> 00:04:14,709
Um, I don't feel so good.

70
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:18,784
Aw. The quiet rivers
in my tummy are becoming...

71
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:21,122
raging waters.

72
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:22,792
Upstairs or downstairs?

73
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:23,894
- Both!
- Both!

74
00:04:25,196 --> 00:04:27,802
Uh, out of the water!
Out of the water!

75
00:04:31,475 --> 00:04:33,747
Not me this time.

76
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:37,555
According to these tests,

77
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:40,393
your kids' insides
and outsides have been exposed

78
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,266
to a toxic mix
of 30-year-old hairspray,

79
00:04:43,332 --> 00:04:45,671
hot dog water, opossum dander,

80
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:49,011
and a grab bag of intestinal
and skin-based parasites.

81
00:04:50,614 --> 00:04:53,687
Oh, my poor queasy babies.

82
00:04:53,754 --> 00:04:56,726
Hmm. I wonder
why Homer didn't get sick.

83
00:04:56,793 --> 00:04:58,664
He even went to work today.

84
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,270
Upstairs and downstairs!

85
00:05:02,337 --> 00:05:05,644
Bart and Lisa will be fine
after a little TLC.

86
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:08,650
By TLC, I mean
"taking Lorexo-Cortisone."

87
00:05:08,717 --> 00:05:11,690
And by little, I mean
a four-week intensive regimen.

88
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:15,263
Oh, steroids?
Are there any side effects?

89
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,700
Nothing serious.

90
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:18,904
Maybe a little
temporary weight gain.

91
00:05:21,342 --> 00:05:22,812
Hurry up, kids!

92
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:25,718
You don't want to be late
for your first day of school.

93
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,757
Ah, a new school year.

94
00:05:28,824 --> 00:05:31,362
Uncracked books, pink erasers,

95
00:05:31,428 --> 00:05:33,700
a binder where
the rings still meet.

96
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,704
And I get
to find out what happened

97
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:38,810
to those praying mantis eggs
I left in Skinner's office.

98
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,119
If, uh, we all agree to respect
each other's workspace,

99
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:45,123
this, uh, year will go
just fine.

100
00:05:48,797 --> 00:05:52,237
Oh, look at that belly. Mwah.

101
00:05:52,304 --> 00:05:55,343
Someone's getting chunky!

102
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,347
Chunky.

103
00:06:11,242 --> 00:06:13,179
Off you go.

104
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:15,517
Don't want to be late
for school.

105
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:24,902
Okay,
forget about what Mom said.

106
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,482
Don't let it ruin
the first day of school.

107
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:27,942
That's the best day of the year!

108
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:29,846
Welcome, class.

109
00:06:29,912 --> 00:06:32,551
This year, we'll be learning
lessons that will stay with you

110
00:06:32,618 --> 00:06:34,922
for the rest of your lives.

111
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,638
Calm down. It's okay.

112
00:06:42,705 --> 00:06:44,308
Attention, students.

113
00:06:44,374 --> 00:06:46,045
Due to budget cuts,
the following

114
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:49,552
after-school programs have
been cancelled: Dance chunk,

115
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:52,490
intramural chunk-ing,
and chunky chunk chunk.

116
00:06:52,558 --> 00:06:54,461
What is going on with me?

117
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:57,501
I'm going chunky.
Aah! I mean, crazy!

118
00:06:59,906 --> 00:07:02,310
Get a grip.

119
00:07:09,024 --> 00:07:11,028
Chunk-chunk!

120
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:12,364
Chunky!

121
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:15,403
Lisa is soft now.

122
00:07:19,645 --> 00:07:21,649
Dang, Simpson.

123
00:07:21,716 --> 00:07:23,587
Have you been to Costco?

124
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:25,724
'Cause you're carrying bulk.

125
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:29,297
Oh, that's because
of the steroids I was taking.

126
00:07:29,364 --> 00:07:31,335
- You see, my mom...
- Steroids!

127
00:07:31,402 --> 00:07:34,441
- Nice!
- Yeah, badass!

128
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:36,579
Like I was saying,

129
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:38,583
I've been juicing pretty hard
all summer.

130
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,255
Had to stop
because I beat up my dad.

131
00:07:41,321 --> 00:07:42,825
Roid rage!

132
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:46,733
No more hanging out with
those babies for you, Simpson.

133
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,471
Today, you become a man.

134
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:51,241
What is this place?

135
00:07:51,308 --> 00:07:55,349
It used to be a padded cell
for left-handed kids.

136
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,955
Welcome to the Meat Castle.

137
00:08:01,328 --> 00:08:03,265
Say goodbye to your victim bod.

138
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:06,706
Your shred-ucation begins today.

139
00:08:06,773 --> 00:08:08,543
Yeah. Swole!

140
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,012
So swole!

141
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,922
Swole! Swole. Swole. Swole!

142
00:08:17,695 --> 00:08:19,632
I'm living every kid's dream...

143
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,872
To be accepted
by his tormentors.

144
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:29,351
Someone's getting chunky!

145
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:36,900
Oh, honey,
you seem down in the dumps.

146
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:38,469
And I know why.

147
00:08:38,537 --> 00:08:40,607
You do?

148
00:08:40,674 --> 00:08:42,978
Because it's really hard
to talk about when...

149
00:08:43,045 --> 00:08:46,285
Of course. I don't know
what I was thinking...

150
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:49,559
by not taking you shopping
for back-to-school clothes.

151
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,161
Wait, what?...?

152
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,537
Oh. Nothing upside downs
my frowns

153
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:57,541
like a girls' trip to the mall.

154
00:08:57,608 --> 00:08:59,411
I don't know, Mom.

155
00:08:59,477 --> 00:09:01,181
I'm just not feeling it.

156
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:05,857
Can I get it? Can I get it?

157
00:09:11,335 --> 00:09:14,441
Hmm. I'm not sure that's a fit.

158
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:18,115
Are you positive
that's the eight-year-old size?

159
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,919
Oh, super pos.

160
00:09:19,986 --> 00:09:22,056
Let's upsize her to a ten short.

161
00:09:22,123 --> 00:09:23,793
Get me some tens
out here, Derek.

162
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,331
The eights are a freaking
disaster on this kid!

163
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:28,970
Forget it, Mom. Let's just go.

164
00:09:29,037 --> 00:09:30,239
Nuh-uh.

165
00:09:30,306 --> 00:09:31,676
We're not leaving this mall

166
00:09:31,743 --> 00:09:35,116
until we find you
a really fun ensemble.

167
00:09:37,153 --> 00:09:38,823
That is so the look.

168
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,194
Yes, I think that is the look.

169
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:43,566
Mom, it's too big!

170
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:45,136
No, it's not.

171
00:09:45,202 --> 00:09:47,808
It's very flattering.

172
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:56,158
It's not your job

173
00:09:56,224 --> 00:09:59,665
to constantly comment
on my appearance!

174
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,437
But, honey, I could never
pull that off.

175
00:10:02,504 --> 00:10:04,975
On you, it's so eye-catching.

176
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:07,548
Oh, you are slaying those tens.

177
00:10:07,614 --> 00:10:10,319
Do you really think I want
to call attention to myself?!

178
00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:12,323
Ugh! Get this thing off of me!

179
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:16,899
Okay, why don't you give these
a try?

180
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:18,770
No!

181
00:10:20,907 --> 00:10:24,180
Um, let's take
a little fro-yo break.

182
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:26,919
You can't fix everything
with fro-yo!

183
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:30,426
That's what you acted like
before the medicine.

184
00:10:30,493 --> 00:10:33,900
Young lady, in this family, we
put clothing back on the hanger

185
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,338
so the salesperson will think
we're classy!

186
00:10:36,404 --> 00:10:38,576
Why are you acting
like such a cranky pants?

187
00:10:38,643 --> 00:10:40,881
Stop talking
to me about clothes!

188
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:43,586
How's everything going in here?
I brought twelves.

189
00:10:43,653 --> 00:10:45,657
Do we need more twelves in here?

190
00:10:45,724 --> 00:10:49,899
This mall is an assault
on human dignity!

191
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:53,138
I hate it! I hate it! I hate it!
I hate it! I hate it!

192
00:10:58,015 --> 00:10:59,952
If they ask
who helped you today,

193
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:02,925
remember, I'm Shauna.

194
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,564
They don't respect you

195
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,402
unless you insult them
just a little bit.

196
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,574
- Girls?
- Cops.

197
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,276
- For real.
- Yeah. Def. Yeah.

198
00:11:12,343 --> 00:11:15,984
Oh, look who got a visit
from the pube fairy.

199
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,988
Dude, those aren't pubes.

200
00:11:18,055 --> 00:11:21,261
Yeah-huh.
Everything new is a pube.

201
00:11:21,328 --> 00:11:24,467
So, Simpson, you got your eyes
on any ladies?

202
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:27,674
Uh, yeah, I'm talking to
a couple dozen honeys right now.

203
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:29,244
I'm in love with most of 'em,

204
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,283
but right now, I want
to keep my focus on the gym.

205
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,356
Pizza rolls are hot!

206
00:11:35,422 --> 00:11:37,059
Uh, what about our reps?

207
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:38,763
There's plenty of time
for that...

208
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,533
after a weight fight!

209
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,482
Working out is awesome!

210
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,929
We don't slam doors
in this house!

211
00:11:58,836 --> 00:12:01,575
So, uh, how was the mall?

212
00:12:01,642 --> 00:12:05,917
Apparently, I'm the worst mother
in the world for being nice.

213
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:09,825
Lisa had a huge tantrum in
front of the cell phone jewelry.

214
00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:12,296
I've asked her a hundred times
what the problem is,

215
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:13,900
and she won't tell me.

216
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,670
Can you talk to her?

217
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:17,006
Of course, honey.

218
00:12:17,073 --> 00:12:20,346
Time for me to earn
my "World's Greatest Dad" mug.

219
00:12:20,412 --> 00:12:23,085
You bought that for yourself
in the hospital gift shop

220
00:12:23,151 --> 00:12:24,788
while I was giving birth.

221
00:12:24,855 --> 00:12:28,495
We both left with something
special that day.

222
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:31,635
Honey,

223
00:12:31,702 --> 00:12:32,862
if something's bothering you,

224
00:12:32,904 --> 00:12:33,840
you got to let it out.

225
00:12:33,906 --> 00:12:35,510
Like swallowed burps,

226
00:12:35,577 --> 00:12:38,482
buried feelings can burst out
at the worst possible...

227
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:41,956
Mom called me "chunky."

228
00:12:43,526 --> 00:12:45,262
Oh, my God.

229
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:48,803
Marge did the one thing no
parent is ever supposed to do...

230
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,241
Acknowledge what their children look like!

231
00:12:51,307 --> 00:12:53,445
Oh, what do I say
to make it better?

232
00:12:53,513 --> 00:12:56,184
I know. I'll tell her
Marge isn't her real mother,

233
00:12:56,251 --> 00:12:58,355
and Lisa and I should pack up
and leave forever.

234
00:12:58,422 --> 00:13:01,194
No, something
about that feels wrong.

235
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:04,133
Hmm, I must use
an entire lifetime

236
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,839
of fatherly knowledge
to help my daughter.

237
00:13:08,876 --> 00:13:12,149
Buying versus leasing...
Pros and cons.

238
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:14,988
How many miles do you think
you'll be driving a year?

239
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:16,357
Thanks for trying, Dad.

240
00:13:16,424 --> 00:13:18,696
That is what
you were doing, right?

241
00:13:18,763 --> 00:13:20,065
Yes.

242
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,336
I can't expect you
to understand my problem.

243
00:13:22,403 --> 00:13:26,377
I just wish I didn't care
what people think.

244
00:13:26,444 --> 00:13:29,217
Honey, if you didn't care,
you wouldn't be human.

245
00:13:29,283 --> 00:13:33,659
Not human, I say.

246
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:35,462
Here we are.

247
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,168
When you called for help,
I was hoping you needed someone

248
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,840
to spell-check
your suicide note.

249
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:43,078
And just so we're clear,
you dented cue ball,

250
00:13:43,145 --> 00:13:44,882
we're not doing this for you.

251
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:47,119
We're here for Lisa.

252
00:13:47,186 --> 00:13:50,125
Hey, look who stopped by!

253
00:13:50,192 --> 00:13:53,733
How would you like to go on
a completely spontaneous outing

254
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,369
with your aunts?

255
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:58,809
- Uh...
- In our world, that's a "yes."

256
00:13:58,876 --> 00:14:01,347
We heard what your mother said.
Not cool.

257
00:14:01,414 --> 00:14:05,322
We only use "chunky"
to describe jewelry and stew.

258
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:09,297
And since we've had stew
for breakfast...

259
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:13,839
Kid, your Aunt Selma and I have
been called every mean name

260
00:14:13,906 --> 00:14:15,242
in the book.

261
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:18,281
You just got
to let it roll off your back.

262
00:14:18,348 --> 00:14:19,718
But how?

263
00:15:28,923 --> 00:15:32,196
Lisa, your dad told me
why you've been upset.

264
00:15:32,262 --> 00:15:35,335
I'm so sorry for what I said.

265
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,809
It was a mistake,
and I feel terrible.

266
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:40,613
Thanks, Mom,
but spending the afternoon

267
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,552
with Aunt Patty and Selma
made me feel a lot better

268
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:45,055
about myself.

269
00:15:45,122 --> 00:15:48,027
And also, a lot worse
about everyone else.

270
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:51,134
Mm. Why couldn't I just
keep my mouth shut?

271
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,073
After all, now
that you're off the steroids,

272
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,144
soon you'll be back to normal.

273
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,916
And you'll be my perfect
little girl again.

274
00:15:58,983 --> 00:16:01,254
So, we all better now?

275
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:18,889
Ooh, how about this one?

276
00:16:18,956 --> 00:16:20,560
It has a lot of notes.

277
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:22,129
I know you like those.

278
00:16:22,196 --> 00:16:24,233
Don't pretend
you know what I like.

279
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,574
Oh, can you just tell me
why we're back to glowering?!

280
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,477
Marge,

281
00:16:29,544 --> 00:16:32,416
I know all about the rough patch
you're having with Lisa.

282
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:35,756
I went through the exact same
thing with Milhouse.

283
00:16:35,823 --> 00:16:37,727
We're so similar, you and I.

284
00:16:37,794 --> 00:16:39,063
Are we, though?

285
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:41,969
Look, I don't just give
this name to everybody.

286
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:44,941
Just my best girlfriends.

287
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:48,081
Hypnotherapy?

288
00:16:48,147 --> 00:16:50,620
Isn't that a little... woo-woo?

289
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:52,590
Dr. Sage is amazing.

290
00:16:52,657 --> 00:16:55,930
We went in not speaking,
and after one session,

291
00:16:55,997 --> 00:16:59,003
we're back in the tub together!

292
00:17:05,783 --> 00:17:07,219
What's up, workout bros?

293
00:17:07,286 --> 00:17:10,860
Who wants toaster strudel?
Extra glaze packets!

294
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,538
Guys, look out!
There's girls in here.

295
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:19,176
They're called girlfriends,
baby dork.

296
00:17:19,243 --> 00:17:21,848
Well, Jimbo and Flor
haven't made it official,

297
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,719
but we're all hopeful.

298
00:17:23,786 --> 00:17:25,221
We don't do labels!

299
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:27,292
But-but I thought
we came here to work out

300
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,198
and-and microwave golf balls
and talk about girls,

301
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:31,535
but not real ones!

302
00:17:31,602 --> 00:17:35,108
I thought we were big boys!

303
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:48,902
So dawn bros down to day.

304
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:52,376
Nothing swole can stay.

305
00:18:00,258 --> 00:18:03,799
Marge, Lisa, today,
we'll be using hypnotherapy

306
00:18:03,866 --> 00:18:05,703
as a tool that builds empathy

307
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,678
by exploring the landscapes
of each other's minds.

308
00:18:09,744 --> 00:18:12,315
I'm sorry. I just find it
a little hard to believe

309
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,453
that everything's going
to be solved just because

310
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:17,292
you swing a gold pocket watch
in front of my face.

311
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,998
Oh, hypnotism
has come a long way

312
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,535
since pocket watches.

313
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:25,876
Now, look into Dr. Mysterio's
Mesmerific Hypnowheel.

314
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,657
Spinny thing.

315
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:36,965
Where are we?

316
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,736
We're in my mind,

317
00:18:38,802 --> 00:18:42,375
and I thought this woman was
a total quack.

318
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:44,814
I can hear everything
you're saying.

319
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:46,117
Sorry.

320
00:18:46,183 --> 00:18:47,787
It's so nice here.

321
00:18:47,854 --> 00:18:50,425
I feel like
I should take my shoes off.

322
00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:53,966
There's a Zen garden,
a waterfall.

323
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:56,972
Chunky!

324
00:18:57,038 --> 00:18:59,544
And it's taking up
so much space!

325
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:02,517
Look what it's done
to the Powerpuff Girls.

326
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:07,225
What if I never get "Chunky"
out of my head?

327
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:09,798
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

328
00:19:09,864 --> 00:19:13,004
If I put it there,
then I'm going to get it out.

329
00:19:18,816 --> 00:19:22,723
I never realized
how much power my words have.

330
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,663
Now that you've explored
Lisa's subconscious,

331
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:28,735
perhaps we should travel
to Marge's.

332
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:30,840
I have one of those?

333
00:19:30,906 --> 00:19:32,844
My old bedroom.

334
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,348
This must be one of my memories.

335
00:19:36,183 --> 00:19:39,122
Mom, what do you think
of my new haircut?

336
00:19:39,189 --> 00:19:40,693
It's nice, but I do think

337
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:44,534
longer hair complements
your plain features.

338
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:49,677
"Plain." Oh, my God.

339
00:19:49,744 --> 00:19:53,284
I don't remember her saying
that, but now I know why

340
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:56,290
it's been in my head
every waking minute.

341
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:04,641
Oh, Lisa, now I know
exactly how I made you feel.

342
00:20:04,707 --> 00:20:07,847
Now I know exactly how you felt.

343
00:20:07,914 --> 00:20:09,951
I love you!

344
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:17,065
I love both of you!

345
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,502
I guess the hurtful things

346
00:20:18,568 --> 00:20:21,875
your mother says to you
never totally disappear.

347
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:24,614
Maybe they don't,
but I really believe

348
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,551
that if you're aware of them,

349
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:30,124
those words will lose
their power over you...

350
00:20:30,191 --> 00:20:35,368
very, very, very slowly.

351
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:36,871
If at all.

352
00:20:36,938 --> 00:20:39,076
But probably not.

353
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,636
I wonder if everyone has words

354
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:54,941
