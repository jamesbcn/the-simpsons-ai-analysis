00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,041
Confound it, man.
I need your throat
clear and ready for perjury.

340
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,970
When you canceled
the drug plan,

341
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,684
I couldn't afford
my Thyroxine anymore.

342
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,367
But before I die,
there are words
I have always longed to say.

343

Sir, I... (CHOKING)

344
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,881
Fear not, Smithers!
I'll move heaven
and Earth to save you!

345
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,530
It's still easier
than teaching

347
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,045
I just wish we could
make one last big score,

348
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,771
but we could never drive
past the border patrol.

349
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,290
There are other ways
to get into Canada.

00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,081
No!

352

That's it! A plane!

353
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,885
Smuggle drugs in a plane?
That'll never work!

354
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,567
Sure, it will.
All we need is a pilot.

355
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,722

No, you fool! 'Tis I, Burns.
Now come with me.

MR. BURNS: At last,
my plane shall be used
for its original purpose,

359
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,484
to subvert the laws
of the United States.

360
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,528
Looks like your
plane's pretty full, eh?

361
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,045
Don't want to overload it.

362
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,281
Pah! Typical
Canadian wimpiness.

363
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,921
That's why you have snowballs,
and we have the H-bomb!

We really appreciate
your help, Johnny.

365
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,442
Is there any way
we can repay you?

366
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,205
Well, I've always
wanted to see a man

367
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,051
with the IQ of a child
executed by the state.

368
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,770
We don't get
that up here.

369
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,606
Really? In America,
we do it four times a week.

370
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,411
You come on down,
and I'll get us
front row seats.

371
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,005
I'd like that.

Time to dump all
unnecessary weight.

00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,880
What? Don't dump me out!
I can lose weight!
Just give me a chance!

Ah, I'd rather die.

377
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,160
It's no use.
We've got to make
an emergency landing.

378
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,402
Well, at least we're
all in this together.

379
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,608
Now, we have three parachutes.

380
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,960
This one's for me.

381
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,687

to arrest me, too!
