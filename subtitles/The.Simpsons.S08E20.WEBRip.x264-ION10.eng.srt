00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,463
<i>Now, when can I tell my</i>
<i>supervisor, Mr. Robinson,</i>

181
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,171
<i>to expect payment?</i>

182
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,211
Good dog.

183
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,674
Come on, boy!

184
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,964
Let's go for a walk!

185
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,301
No, not you. Laddie.

186
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,803
Come on, I got a job for you.

187
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,061
(whimpers)

188
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,765
Good boy.

189
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,284
We didn't see nothing
if you didn't see nothing.

190
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,120
(gasps)
Oh, no.

191
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,041
Repo men!

192
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,699
Laddie, hide behind
that bush there.

193
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,133
Mom and Dad
aren't home, are they?

194
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,210
No. They went for a walk
with the Flanders.

195
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,215
Bart, what's going on? Why are those
repo guys taking all your stuff?

196
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,008
The dog and I got
a credit card and--

197
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:14,602
Credit card? Oh, I knew you were
up to no good.

198
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,809
Okay, so I committed
a little mail fraud.

199
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,769
Haven't I been
punished enough?

200
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,269
Hey, stop! You can take back
the bassinet,

201
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,732
but the baby's ours!

202
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:27,072
And the last item
is one $1,200 dog.

203
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,399
-Is that him?
-(snarling)

204
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,907
Well, is he the dog
or isn't he?

205
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,454
(gulps)

206
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,157
Yeah. That's him, all right.

207
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,917
Sorry, boy.
I didn't plan this.

208
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,415
It just sort of happened.

209
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,312
Mom, can I feed Laddie
at the table?

210
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,186
Oh, it's against
the house rule...

211
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,324
Oh, I guess just this once.

212
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,911
Oh, I don't know
about this dog.

213
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,119
He's kind of... snooty.

214
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,287
Homer, are you wearing a tie

215
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,910
to impress Laddie?

216
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,367
Do you think he noticed?

217
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,667
(grumbling)

218
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,462
Where's Santa's Little Helper?

219
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,545
Who?

220
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,590
Um, I took him to a kennel...

221
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,973
two towns over just till
the new dog gets settled.

222
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,971
Well, we wrecked
the first dog.

223
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,013
We've got to treat
this one right.

224
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,516
Bart, why don't you take Laddie
for another walk?

225
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,269
No. Bart had his turn.
Let me!

226
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,772
I can't resist his charms.

227
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,614
Let's all walk Laddie.

228
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,448
Hey, this park is great!

229
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,818
How come we never take
Santa's Little Helper here?

230
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,656
Crowds give him gas.

231
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,621
Besides, he's happy just hanging
around the house with Bart.

232
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,502
Um... yeah.

233
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,539
Hey, that is one fine-looking animal
you got there.

234
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,794
Wow. T.V.'s Kent Brockman!

235
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,706
(laughs)

236
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,005
Hey, this fellow's not
available to stud, is he?

237
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,589
You want some puppies,
eh, Mr. Brockman?

238
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,134
No, no.
Jessica's been fixed.

239
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,637
She just needs a little...
attention.

240
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,720
Why, that canine has
the proud bearing

241
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,676
and glossy fur coat
of a Yale man.

242
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,227
Hello, little fella.

243
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,478
Smithers, I believe this dog
was in Skull and Bones.

244
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,316
Whoa, cool dog!

245
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,652
Can he catch a Frisbee?

246
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,407
(barking)

247
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,451
(cheering)

248
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,656
Boy, Bart Laddie's
the best dog in the world.

249
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,617
He's nothing like
your old dog.

250
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,538
Santa's Little Helper?

251
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,666
Guess I was the only one
who loved him.

252
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,263
You got that right.

253
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,168
Remember the time
he ate my goldfish

254
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,757
and you lied to me and said
I never had any goldfish?

255
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,643
But why'd I have
the bowl, Bart?

256
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,180
Why did I have the bowl?

257
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,894
Yeah.

258
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,394
He was a great dog.

259
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,858
Oh, Santa's Little Helper,

260
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,610
I was crazy to give you up
for another dog.

261
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,532
What have I done to you?

262
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,704
(horn blowing)

263
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,081
Captain, can't we go
any faster?

264
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,789
I greatly fear we shan't be
in Wimbledon by noonfall.

265
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,710
No worries, madam.

266
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,578
Lumley! Shovel on
more dogs, won't you?

267
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,586
Aye, aye.
More dogs!

268
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,708
-(bell ringing)
-More dogs!

269
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,514
In you go.

270
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,142
(gasps)

271
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,508
Nah. That's not too likely.

272
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,756
But still...

273
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,637
you're gone.

274
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,524
Oh.

275
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,731
Where you are you, boy?

276
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,650
(horn blowing)

277
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,106
"Time for a walk."

278
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,453
Ohh! Again?

279
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,608
We got to find out
where he's keeping these.

280
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,157
I'd take him, but those cards
are nontransferable.

281
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,741
Ohh...

282
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,663
CHILD: Help! Help!

283
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,963
(barking)

284
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,554
Now what?
Aw, come on.

285
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,630
I want to go home.

286
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,263
So, Laddie,

287
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,513
thank you for
your heroic rescue.

288
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,925
And, baby Gerald,
we can't help but wonder

289
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,635
what mischief
you'll get into next.

290
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,596
(applause)

291
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,187
Now can we go home?

292
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,862
Laddie saved the day, Simpson.

293
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,031
Boy, we sure could use
a dog like that on the force.

294
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,779
Why don't you guys
take him?

295
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,783
I thought he was
the right dog for me

296
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,775
but I guess
I made a mistake.

297
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,787
Really? No fooling?

298
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,619
Aw, gee,
thanks, mister.

299
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,294
We'll take real
good care of him

300
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,083
and we'll play
with him every day.

301
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,536
Honest.
(grunting)

302
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:01,215
Oh, Maggie,
you got oatmeal all over.

303
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,628
Homie, would you
clean her off?

304
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,126
Can do.

305
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,644
Laddie!

306
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,890
(whistling)

307
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,432
Come here, boy!

308
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,015
Who wants to lick a messy baby?

309
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,101
-Laddie?
-Uh, Dad?

310
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,856
Laddie's not coming.

311
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,318
-I gave him away.
-What's the matter, Bart?

312
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,110
Weren't you happy with him?

313
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,403
No. He just wasn't
the right dog for me.

314
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,027
I'm sure he'll be happy
as a police dog.

315
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,534
He better know
how to keep his mouth shut.

316
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,076
Well, if that's what
you think is best.

317
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,750
Let's just go down
to the kennel

318
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,749
and get Santa's
Little Helper back.

319
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,791
Uh, well, we can't.

320
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,956
He's not in a kennel.

321
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,174
I gave him away, too,
and I don't know where he is.

322
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,795
You gave both dogs away?

323
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,592
You know how I feel
about giving!

324
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,716
I'm sorry. I know it's wrong.
I messed everything up,

325
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,814
and now I don't have
any dogs at all.

326
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,810
There, there.

327
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,102
Shut up, boy.

328
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,694
We'll just get you a new dog.

329
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,729
I don't want a new dog.

330
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,363
I want Santa's Little Helper.

331
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,980
Well, crying isn't going
to bring him back...

332
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,777
unless your tears
smell like dog food.

333
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,822
So you can either
sit there crying

334
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,776
and eating can after can
of dog food

335
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,236
until your tears
smell enough like dog food

336
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,657
to make your dog come back

337
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,955
or you can go out there
and find your dog.

338
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,830
You're right.
I'll do it.

339
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,878
Rats. I almost had him
eating dog food.

340
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,178
I'm going to get the dog back.

341
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,968
HOMER:
The bad dog or the good dog?

342
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,512
-The bad dog.
-Oh, good.

343
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,482
You got to give me back
my floor.

344
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,481
My customers are walking around
on the pipes!

345
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,734
Hey, next time,
pay your bills.

346
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,775
But I don't want to.

347
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,279
{\an8}Excuse me, sir. Did you repossess
this dog from a guy

348
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,032
named Santos L. Halper?

349
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,744
Hmm. Yeah, yeah.
I remember this mutt.

350
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,535
We, uh, sold him
to some guy

351
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,999
wearing a dress.

352
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,619
No, I didn't buy your dog.

353
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,166
I got to go keep
an eye on Selma.

354
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,290
She thinks
she swallowed a Band-Aid.

355
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,934
(heavy brogue) Yeah, I bought
your mutt, and I ate him.

356
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,048
(gasps)

357
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,215
I ate his little face.
I ate his guts.

358
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,805
And I 'ate the way
he's always barking!

359
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:19,771
So I gave him to the church.

360
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:23,733
Oh, I see. You hate him
so you gave him to the church.

361
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,356
Aye. I also ate
the mess he left on me rug.

362
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,704
You heard me.

363
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:34,414
Mmm, yes, I remember
Satan's Little Helper...

364
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,583
littering the rectory
with his dirt,

365
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,212
biting me in the apse.

366
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,118
He unholied the holy water.

367
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,667
That's him, all right.

368
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,590
I'll be happy to take him
off your hands.

369
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,339
I'm afraid
that's impossible, Bart.

370
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,711
He's no longer among us.

371
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,377
(gasps)
You didn't crucify him?

372
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,546
(hearty laugh)

373
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,006
No. He's safely with
one of our parishioners.

374
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,177
I'll give you his address,
if you like.

375
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,136
And then,
buy something or get out!

376
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,147
Angel.

377
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,028
Hey, it's him.
It's Santa's Little Helper!

378
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,752
-(buzzes)
-MAN: <i>Yes?</i>

379
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,198
My name is Bart Simpson.

380
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,368
I have to talk to you
about your dog.

381
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,667
Give me one minute.

382
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,670
Okay... showtime.

383
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,462
(wicked laugh)

384
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,088
Please, mister...

385
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,223
(clears throat)
No. Let me do that again.

386
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,760
Please, mister.

387
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,683
(sobbing):
Ple-he-he-he-ase...

388
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,762
(gasps)

389
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,517
Hi, there.
How can I help you?

390
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,979
You're the guy
who owns the dog?

391
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,809
Yep. His name's Sprinkles.

392
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,614
-Sprinkles?
-Yeah. He's my best buddy, huh?

393
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,108
Especially since my parrot
decided to stop talking.

394
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,691
Polly? Polly want to say hi
to our guest? Huh?

395
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,318
Fine. Be that way.

396
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,315
Now, what can I do
for you, son?

397
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,327
Oh, nothing.
Forget it.

398
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,669
So, that's my plan.

399
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,669
I'm gonna break into
the blind man's yard

400
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,541
and swipe the dog.

401
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,708
Bart, that is a new low.

402
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,377
Hey, I'm not saying it's going to be
a dance around the maypole.

403
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,126
I won't tell Mom and Dad

404
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,098
but only because
I want the dog back.

405
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,598
Just try not to freak out
the blind man.

406
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,720
I can't promise I'll try,

407
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,478
but I'll try to try.

408
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,944
(whistles softly)

409
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,522
(whispers):
Here, boy. Come on.

410
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,527
(muffled yelp)

411
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,068
Oh...

412
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,656
(water splashing)

413
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,452
-(squishing)
-Ew!

414
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,537
Psst!

415
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,789
Oh! I missed you
so much, boy.

416
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:48,876
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

417
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,381
Now, keep quiet, okay?

418
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,672
(barks)

419
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:53,796
MITCHELL:
Sprinkles?

420
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,182
Is there somebody down there?

421
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,429
Come on, boy.
Let's blow.

422
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,715
Who's there?
I can take you on.

423
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,306
You want to try me?
Come on!

424
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,024
Where is he, Sprinkles?
Come on. Let's get him.

425
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,895
No, no, no. Not the piano.
I can't play now.

426
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,404
-(squeaks)
-(door slams)

427
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,776
Ha! I may be blind,

428
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,784
but you just ran
into a closet.

429
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,406
-D-ohh!
-(lock clicks)

430
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,747
Heh-heh!

431
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,750
Hey, burglar!

432
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,332
I hope you're having
a good time in there,

433
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,667
'cause the police
will be here any minute.

434
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,302
No, mister.
Please, I 'm just a kid.

435
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,130
I... I only came
to get my dog back.

436
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,467
Your dog?

437
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,932
(whines)

438
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,313
And I miss him so much.

439
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,429
And I know you like him,
but I like him, too.

440
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,306
And he was mine first.
I know I don't deserve him.

441
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,103
So what this
comes down to is

442
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,267
you want a blind man

443
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,515
to give up
his only companion?

444
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,857
Yes, please.

445
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,491
Hmm. Tell you what:

446
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:59,069
Why don't we let
the dog decide?

447
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,486
-Come on, Sprinkles!
-Come on, Santa's Little Helper!

448
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,034
-Here, Sprinkles!
-I'm sorry!

449
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:05,117
I'm blind,
Come to the blind man!

450
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,924
I'll let you be with me
all the time.

451
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,578
I need you more, come on!

452
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,376
(overlapping chatter)

453
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,342
Come on!

454
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,762
Attaboy!
Oh, I knew you'd come!

455
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,092
Give me a kiss!

456
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,797
Oh-oh-oh. Yeah.

457
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,428
Sounds like you won.

458
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,595
Congratulations.

459
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,233
Oh, geez.
I'm sorry.

460
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,401
I wish there was some way
we could both have a dog.

461
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,150
(pounding)

462
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,856
-(doorbell rings)
-Hello.

463
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,704
Police.

464
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,949
Ah, man, if this one's
not the right house, I quit.

465
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,582
It's okay, Officer.
False alarm.

466
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,909
(barking)

467
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,869
Uh... hey, who's that!

468
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,828
Well, I like you, too.

469
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,338
Well, looks like somebody's
made a new best friend.

470
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,591
(laughs)
Okay, boy.

471
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,384
That's enough.
That's...

472
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,837
That's not for doggies.

473
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,347
Don't...

474
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,548
Oh, jeez.

475
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,598
(barks)

476
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,772
(sniffs)
Marijuana.

477
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,560
Well. I guess he didn't
like you after all.

478
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,975
He just smelled
your narcotics.

479
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,274
Book him, boys.

480
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,397
Hold on, Chief.

481
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,533
It might be medicinal.

482
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,569
Uh... yeah.
M-medicinal.

483
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,663
I... without it,
I could, uh...

484
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:24,198
go even... blinder.

485
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,623
Right?

486
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,412
Eh, this might take
a while, kid.

487
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,705
Why don't you and your buddy
run along?

488
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,499
Bye, Laddie.

489
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:35,002
Come on, boy. Let's go home
and have some fun, huh?
