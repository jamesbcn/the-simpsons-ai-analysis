1
00:00:07,448 --> 00:00:10,053
We sure lucked out
with this new gig.

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,358
Half day on Christmas,
unpaid polio leave,

3
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:14,596
and all the bread crumbs
you can sweep.

4
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:20,107
Mac, we just
got our first paychecks.

5
00:00:20,173 --> 00:00:22,679
Take this money
and turn it into giggle water.

6
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:25,685
FICA?!

7
00:00:25,752 --> 00:00:26,654
What the hell is that?

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,858
Eh, that's your
Social Security tax.

9
00:00:28,925 --> 00:00:30,662
Government takes our money,

10
00:00:30,728 --> 00:00:33,868
then gives it back
when you retire in 50 years.

11
00:00:33,935 --> 00:00:36,740
What? Stupid government
thinks it's smarter than me.

12
00:00:36,807 --> 00:00:38,209
I can handle my money.

13
00:00:38,276 --> 00:00:41,182
Put five bucks
on any two animals fighting.

14
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,253
And I'll eat the loser.

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,357
We're not gonna
need Social Security.

16
00:00:45,424 --> 00:00:46,292
We're gonna be rich.

17
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:49,231
Yeah, we'll never
need government help.

18
00:00:49,298 --> 00:00:51,169
Help me, government!

19
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:53,674
We need our
Social Security checks.

20
00:00:53,741 --> 00:00:56,880
Make rain a modest,
fixed amount.

21
00:01:26,406 --> 00:01:28,678
Now, this is what
I call cribbage.

22
00:01:28,744 --> 00:01:30,113
Abe wins again!

23
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,688
Another great day in the books.

24
00:01:33,754 --> 00:01:36,527
Now to cap it all off
with a medicated foot bath

25
00:01:36,593 --> 00:01:40,000
and a nice, deep-ear Q-tipping.

26
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,487
Hello?

27
00:01:50,555 --> 00:01:52,826
- Grandfather!
- You've got to help me!

28
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:55,130
What?
Is that you, Bart?

29
00:01:55,197 --> 00:01:57,635
That's right.
It's me, Bart.

30
00:01:57,702 --> 00:01:59,806
I'm so scared.
I'm in jail!

31
00:01:59,873 --> 00:02:02,311
- Jail?
- Please don't - tell my dad or mom.

32
00:02:02,377 --> 00:02:04,916
They'll be so mad. The policeman
needs to talk to you.

33
00:02:04,983 --> 00:02:07,321
Sir, your grandson
is in big trouble.

34
00:02:07,387 --> 00:02:09,993
No, not Bart.
My little angel.

35
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,166
Well, he was arrested for
vandalism and shoplifting, sir.

36
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,705
Yeah, that sounds like Bart,
that little devil.

37
00:02:15,772 --> 00:02:18,076
If you don't send his bail money
in the next 90 minutes,

38
00:02:18,143 --> 00:02:19,503
he's going straight
to the downtown

39
00:02:19,546 --> 00:02:21,115
juvenile detention center.

40
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,654
Grandfather! Help me! Please!

41
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:24,790
Don't worry, Bart.

42
00:02:24,856 --> 00:02:27,027
Just tell me what you need
and I'll do it.

43
00:02:27,094 --> 00:02:29,431
Your Grampa loves you.

44
00:02:31,703 --> 00:02:34,108
I need to wire some money
to an overseas account

45
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:37,080
to bail my grandson
out of an unnamed jail.

46
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:38,784
Fill out this form.

47
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:41,523
I didn't know my little Emma
was in Colombia,

48
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,696
let alone
working as a drug mule.

49
00:02:44,763 --> 00:02:47,100
I'm just thankful
the Russian secret police

50
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,806
will accept the title
to my Lexus.

51
00:02:52,712 --> 00:02:54,649
Mr. Simpson, we've
confirmed receipt.

52
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,653
Your grandson
will be released...

53
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,156
Oh, thank God.

54
00:02:58,223 --> 00:02:59,659
...once you pay
his processing fees,

55
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:02,397
holding cell costs
and handcuff tax.

56
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:05,103
It's on its way,
plus a little extra

57
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,876
for you being so helpful.

58
00:03:07,942 --> 00:03:10,380
Did he reach out to his father?
His mother?

59
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:12,184
His dead grandmother?

60
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:13,988
No.
He came to me.

61
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:16,560
Because Bart knew that
he could count on his Grampa

62
00:03:16,627 --> 00:03:19,498
to get him
out of any kind of jam.

63
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,010
Oh, thank goodness
you're out!

64
00:03:27,615 --> 00:03:29,719
Okay, okay,
enough with the smooches.

65
00:03:29,786 --> 00:03:32,291
I don't care what you've done.
All that matters

66
00:03:32,357 --> 00:03:35,030
is that no grandson of mine's
gonna go to jail.

67
00:03:35,096 --> 00:03:37,702
Jail?
Are you off your meds

68
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:38,837
or on new meds?

69
00:03:38,904 --> 00:03:40,942
Bart, don't you remember?

70
00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:44,048
I just wired all that money
to pay your bail.

71
00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:46,954
Whoa, Grampa,
I think you were...

72
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,156
scammed.

73
00:03:48,222 --> 00:03:50,928
Me, scammed?

74
00:03:50,995 --> 00:03:52,197
That's impossible.

75
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:54,936
No one hornswoggles Abraham J...

76
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:56,339
S-I-M-P-S-O-N.

77
00:03:56,405 --> 00:04:00,180
Social Security number:
327-00-3658.

78
00:04:00,246 --> 00:04:02,117
First pet's name: Homer.

79
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,058
I've been hornswoggled.

80
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,966
You're watching
the Punt Zone channel.

81
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:11,570
It's nothing but punts.

82
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:13,640
Never miss another
exciting fair catch

83
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:17,180
or thrilling second
of hang time.

84
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:19,351
It's fourth and long,
here's the snap.

85
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:22,391
It's a fake punt!
Cut away! Cut away!

86
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:25,698
Guys, something happened
to Grampa.

87
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,869
I got bamboozled out of my money

88
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,373
by a flimflam artist.

89
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,945
It's not his fault.
Some scammer

90
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:34,448
convinced him I was in jail.

91
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:36,686
I'm so sorry, Grampa.

92
00:04:36,753 --> 00:04:40,160
Um, uh, let me
go microwave your slippers.

93
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:42,632
I don't deserve warm toes.

94
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:46,506
I'm nothing but a feeble,
useless, old idjit.

95
00:04:46,573 --> 00:04:49,746
No. You were just trying
to be a good grandparent.

96
00:04:49,813 --> 00:04:52,618
And one bad apple
took advantage of you.

97
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:54,923
You got nothing
to feel bad about.

98
00:04:54,989 --> 00:04:59,331
Bart in jail? I would have
fallen for that, too.

99
00:04:59,398 --> 00:05:00,610
I mean, how much money
could they have taken

100
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,471
from a retired,
old meatball man...

101
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:05,578
50 bucks plus a pocketful
of hard candies?

102
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:08,517
Here you go, Dad. I'll cover it.
What's the damage?

103
00:05:08,584 --> 00:05:11,322
Ten thousand dollars!

104
00:05:12,658 --> 00:05:14,629
Where the hell
did you get that kind of money,

105
00:05:14,696 --> 00:05:16,900
you broken-down
old meatball man?

106
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:19,471
It's 20 years
of my cribbage winnings,

107
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:21,843
saved up in a cigar box.

108
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,951
I was gonna leave it to you,
and now it's all gone.

109
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:30,561
No. No.

110
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:31,930
No!

111
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,971
I had an inheritance
and you gave it away?

112
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:38,409
I'm so mad I could kill you,

113
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:40,313
but now I'd get nothing.

114
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,552
I hope you live forever!

115
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:50,366
Now to read Abraham J. Simpson's

116
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,672
final will and testament.

117
00:05:52,738 --> 00:05:54,576
To my surviving Homers,

118
00:05:54,642 --> 00:05:56,780
I leave you $10,000

119
00:05:56,846 --> 00:05:59,484
that I never told you about...

120
00:05:59,552 --> 00:06:01,222
- Oh! - Huh?
- Yeah?

121
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:03,560
...but then I lost it all
to a scam.

122
00:06:03,627 --> 00:06:05,230
So, because I'm a moron,

123
00:06:05,296 --> 00:06:07,100
I leave you nothing.

124
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:10,708
Ten thousand dollars!

125
00:06:10,774 --> 00:06:12,979
That dream again?

126
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:15,651
The money's gone, gone.

127
00:06:15,718 --> 00:06:19,091
But how can you miss money
you never knew you had?

128
00:06:19,157 --> 00:06:21,830
That's the worst part:
To find out got money,

129
00:06:21,896 --> 00:06:24,268
but you lost money,
so you have it,

130
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:25,537
but you don't have it.

131
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:27,875
Oh, it's giving me whipcash.

132
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:34,321
Just think of all the ways
my life could have been better

133
00:06:34,388 --> 00:06:36,860
with that ten grand.

134
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:51,288
So, uh, we're asking each family
to chip in $50

135
00:06:51,355 --> 00:06:53,627
for a new
fundraising thermometer.

136
00:06:53,694 --> 00:06:56,966
Oh, yeah, 50 bucks...
I would totally donate that

137
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:58,202
if my father hadn't

138
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:01,342
given away $10,000!

139
00:07:01,408 --> 00:07:03,980
Um, it's just
a suggested amount.

140
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:07,688
Sure, ten grand might not
sound like much to you teachers,

141
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:10,360
but I choose inheriting $10,000

142
00:07:10,426 --> 00:07:13,366
over earning a million.

143
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:15,069
And all of you
would do the same!

144
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:16,873
Homer, not here.

145
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,344
Because generational wealth
is the purest,

146
00:07:19,411 --> 00:07:21,482
most sacred kind of money
there is.

147
00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:24,454
But my father fell for
some super-obvious scam

148
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:26,693
because his brain is made of

149
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,231
powdered mashed potatoes.

150
00:07:29,297 --> 00:07:33,172
So, no, I will not be donating.

151
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:38,812
- Oh...
- Marge, if I may, I-I dealt with a similar situation

152
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,621
with my mother.
She got a phone call

153
00:07:40,687 --> 00:07:42,825
claiming punk rockers were
threatening to cut my hair

154
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:45,631
into a Mohawk, which is
a distinctive hairstyle...

155
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:46,866
I know what it is.

156
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,004
This place got us through it.

157
00:07:50,741 --> 00:07:52,778
This could be just what we need.

158
00:07:52,845 --> 00:07:54,816
Oh, uh, sorry,
that's not for you to keep.

159
00:07:54,882 --> 00:07:57,253
I don't get
many business cards.

160
00:07:59,057 --> 00:08:02,163
Group therapy? In my day,
we dealt with horrible shame

161
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,102
by getting blind drunk,
stumbling into a hobo camp

162
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:06,639
and fighting their king.

163
00:08:06,706 --> 00:08:09,077
Sometimes it worked,
sometimes it didn't.

164
00:08:09,144 --> 00:08:10,547
Just give it a try, Abe.

165
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:13,587
It'll help to know
that you're not alone.

166
00:08:14,822 --> 00:08:16,759
Nice, Marge.

167
00:08:16,826 --> 00:08:19,231
Making Dad sit through
a pathetic sob-fest

168
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:22,638
with his fellow losers
is the perfect punishment.

169
00:08:22,705 --> 00:08:25,042
There's a group for you, too.

170
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,353
I... wish I never voted
to build this community center.

171
00:08:31,723 --> 00:08:34,327
I should have known
mortgage lenders

172
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:36,398
don't take
Applebee's gift cards.

173
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:38,837
He said if I didn't wire
the money to the power company,

174
00:08:38,904 --> 00:08:41,208
they'd shut off my electricity.

175
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:43,547
I am the power company.

176
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:44,782
Catfished.

177
00:08:44,849 --> 00:08:46,753
Now it seems so obvious

178
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:49,725
that I would never meet
the real Melissa Joan Hart

179
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:51,963
in a online billiards forum.

180
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,769
These criminals
target the good in all of us,

181
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,240
so the first step
is to take a deep breath

182
00:08:57,307 --> 00:08:59,477
and forgive ourselves.

183
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:06,893
My mother paid hackers to return
her stolen computer photos.

184
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,331
They weren't gone.
They were backed up

185
00:09:09,397 --> 00:09:12,170
to the cloud, Dropbox,
Time Machine...

186
00:09:12,236 --> 00:09:14,140
Things of that nature.

187
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:17,413
Now, these are the things you
should never say to a victim.

188
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,552
"I would never
have fallen for that."

189
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:22,190
"Everyone knows
about that scam,"

190
00:09:22,256 --> 00:09:24,427
and "What were you thinking?"

191
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:26,465
I would have never
fallen for that!

192
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,402
Everyone knows about that scam!

193
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:30,439
What were you thinking?!

194
00:09:30,507 --> 00:09:31,876
No, it wasn't my fault.

195
00:09:31,943 --> 00:09:34,649
This group taught me
not to feel shame.

196
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:37,788
I'm on a path of healing
and self-empowerment.

197
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:39,625
You better not be.

198
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:42,898
Now, what do we say
to shamers like him?

199
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:45,202
Shaming is blaming.

200
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:48,075
Yes, 100% agree!

201
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,187
How could you treat
Grampa like that?

202
00:09:54,254 --> 00:09:56,626
You think you're so smart.
Do you really think

203
00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:59,264
the same thing
wouldn't have happened to you?

204
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,667
Me? Impossible.

205
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,705
I'm too savvy.

206
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:05,510
This savvy!
See?

207
00:10:05,577 --> 00:10:08,550
Dad, anyone can get scammed.
Even me.

208
00:10:08,616 --> 00:10:10,821
I paid the bullies
for wedgie insurance.

209
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:12,791
But the minute
I got a wedgie, bam!

210
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:15,396
I got hit with a deductible...
Another wedgie!

211
00:10:15,463 --> 00:10:16,966
And my rates went up.

212
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,106
That's why I never get
any insurance.

213
00:10:20,172 --> 00:10:21,843
I got an email
saying I qualified

214
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:23,847
for the Saxophone
Junior Olympics,

215
00:10:23,913 --> 00:10:26,786
but when I clicked the link,
they hacked my phone

216
00:10:26,853 --> 00:10:30,493
and stole
my Audible listener credits.

217
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:34,668
You clicked the link?

218
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:38,510
That's so...
Who clicks the link?

219
00:10:38,576 --> 00:10:40,446
Even children are being scammed?

220
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,285
Well, maybe there's a few more
bad apples than I thought.

221
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:47,895
But I still have to believe
the barrel is mostly good.

222
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:50,399
Oh, Marge, how I envy
your sweet innocence.

223
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:54,675
The world is a blender full
of sharks set on extra teeth.

224
00:10:54,742 --> 00:10:57,380
So you got to be like me...
Always on guard

225
00:10:57,446 --> 00:11:00,787
so you're never a sucker.

226
00:11:00,854 --> 00:11:02,991
Delivery for Homer Simpson.

227
00:11:03,058 --> 00:11:04,728
Why'd you buy all these knives?

228
00:11:04,795 --> 00:11:07,601
They're not knives.
They're the future of cutlery.

229
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,337
Put 'em in the garage
with the others.

230
00:11:09,404 --> 00:11:10,404
Others?

231
00:11:11,776 --> 00:11:13,713
Cutlife is a famous

232
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,051
multi-level marketing company.

233
00:11:16,117 --> 00:11:19,357
Dad, you fell
for a pyramid scheme.

234
00:11:19,424 --> 00:11:21,562
Scheme? No way.

235
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:23,165
They didn't even
want to let me join.

236
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:26,171
But, luckily, at the last
minute, a space opened up.

237
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:28,375
How many knives
have you even sold?

238
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:30,881
I don't sell them.

239
00:11:30,947 --> 00:11:32,584
I engage opportunity handlers

240
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,755
to distributize them for me,

241
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:36,926
the expandibution manager.

242
00:11:36,993 --> 00:11:39,297
It's all
part of Charles E. Cutlife's

243
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:42,069
three-dimensional
triangle system.

244
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:43,940
- Look!
- Why can't Dad

245
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:45,911
ever get arrested in a suit?

246
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:47,547
Face it, genius:

247
00:11:47,614 --> 00:11:50,987
You got scammed.

248
00:11:51,054 --> 00:11:54,127
She's right. Everyone's right.

249
00:11:54,193 --> 00:11:57,099
Don't look at my gullible face!

250
00:11:57,901 --> 00:12:00,840
And so I consign to the flames

251
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:03,412
a monument to my own stupidity.

252
00:12:03,478 --> 00:12:04,480
No!

253
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:10,392
Now, isn't there someone
you need to apologize to?

254
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:11,829
Maybe your father?

255
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:13,131
Yeah, you're right.

256
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:16,271
I said such horrible things
to him.

257
00:12:18,776 --> 00:12:20,580
All that time
I was yelling at you,

258
00:12:20,647 --> 00:12:22,584
it turns out I'm a sucker, too.

259
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:24,053
Will you forgive me, Dad?

260
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,057
Of course, son.
Hopefully, we've all

261
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:28,830
come out of this
a little more savvy.

262
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:33,338
Hello?
Yes, this is a grandparent

263
00:12:33,405 --> 00:12:36,946
of a boy or girl. Sure,
put him or her on the phone.

264
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:39,484
No!
Lisa's in jail!

265
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,189
Grampa, they're trying
to trick you again.

266
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:44,127
It's the same swindler.

267
00:12:44,193 --> 00:12:46,464
He must think
I'm greedy for more.

268
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,201
I got an idea.

269
00:12:49,437 --> 00:12:52,443
Grampa, you got to keep talking
so that guy stays on the phone.

270
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:53,813
Keep talking?

271
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,583
I've been preparing
for this moment

272
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,186
my entire life.

273
00:12:57,253 --> 00:12:58,956
Sir, look, if you don't

274
00:12:59,023 --> 00:13:00,794
put up that bail money,
your granddaughter

275
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,864
will be spending the night
in the cooler.

276
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:05,436
In my day, we didn't have
fancy coolers,

277
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:08,743
so everyone took turns blowing
on the meat to keep it fresh,

278
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,982
unless you hired a Dutch family
to blow on your food for you.

279
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:15,289
Breezies is what you'd call 'em.

280
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:23,606
Sir, if you could just

281
00:13:23,673 --> 00:13:25,643
give us your bank information...

282
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,281
It was quite the scandal
when a breezy

283
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:31,254
married a smusher...
Those were the fellas you hired

284
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:33,893
to flatten your sandwiches
by sitting on 'em...

285
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,999
And the whole town came out
to throw tar...

286
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,872
Wow, that's some
quality prattle.

287
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:41,809
Okay, I've run all three hours
of the call

288
00:13:41,876 --> 00:13:43,779
through open-source
audio software,

289
00:13:43,846 --> 00:13:45,449
and the unique pattern
of church bells

290
00:13:45,517 --> 00:13:49,591
and roller-coaster screams
pins the location to...

291
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,200
...ladies and gentlemen,
the address of the scammer.

292
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,072
Whoa, we could
get the money back.

293
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:59,043
It's not about the money.

294
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,749
I want to show that bad guy
the face of the old man

295
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:04,955
whose love and decency
he exploited.

296
00:14:05,022 --> 00:14:07,527
Oh, honey, you have
a beautiful heart.

297
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:08,896
But make no mistake...

298
00:14:08,963 --> 00:14:11,635
It is about the money!

299
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:32,811
Kids, today you're gonna
learn an important lesson:

300
00:14:32,877 --> 00:14:35,617
Sometimes the sheep
get back their wool.

301
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:38,388
No, they don't.
They just grow more wool.

302
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:40,827
What are you, a shepherd?
Come on, Dad.

303
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:42,964
Let's go get
my eventual money back.

304
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,137
How are we gonna
get past the guard?

305
00:14:46,204 --> 00:14:48,141
Aw, don't worry about that.

306
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:51,247
My friends can get us in.

307
00:14:53,251 --> 00:14:55,590
That's the surgical precision
you only get

308
00:14:55,657 --> 00:14:57,794
from the finest Idaho steel.

309
00:14:57,861 --> 00:15:00,767
Amazing.
I'll take the full set.

310
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,637
Oh, you're not
buying the knives.

311
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:04,073
I could sell them?

312
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,413
No, you can sell other people
on selling them.

313
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:11,154
These knives sell
selling themselves themselves.

314
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,759
This is the opportunity
of a lifetime!

315
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:17,567
I'm gonna go tell my pregnant
wife about my new career.

316
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:21,140
Okay, Grampa,
we're gonna find that bad guy

317
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:23,612
and get you some justice.

318
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,589
Uh, which one's the scammer?

319
00:15:28,656 --> 00:15:30,526
They're all the scammer.

320
00:15:30,593 --> 00:15:32,864
The IRS tax police
are on their way to your home,

321
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:35,903
but we'll accept immediate
payment in Fortnite V-bucks.

322
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,375
Oh, your Airbnb
is all ready to go, there.

323
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:40,580
I'm fluffing the towels
right now.

324
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:42,116
Fluff, fluff.

325
00:15:42,182 --> 00:15:44,053
There's so many of them.

326
00:15:44,955 --> 00:15:47,927
You are all
in an unethical industry

327
00:15:47,994 --> 00:15:50,365
and we have called
the authorities.

328
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,405
Oh, man.

329
00:15:53,471 --> 00:15:56,344
Another boiler room
of phone hucksters.

330
00:15:56,411 --> 00:15:58,549
All right, scambags,
you know the drill:

331
00:15:58,616 --> 00:16:02,590
You don't got to go home,
but you can't grift here.

332
00:16:05,028 --> 00:16:07,667
- Come on. - What?
- Really?

333
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,307
Aren't you going to arrest them?

334
00:16:11,374 --> 00:16:13,344
Marge, you shut down
one of these,

335
00:16:13,411 --> 00:16:15,415
five more
pop up in its place.

336
00:16:15,482 --> 00:16:18,054
Phone fraud and
Halloween costumes for pets

337
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:20,726
are America's
only growth industries.

338
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:23,966
So they're just employees
doing this for a paycheck?

339
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:26,037
I wish we got paid in money.

340
00:16:26,103 --> 00:16:28,809
All we get is minimum wage
and gift cards.

341
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:30,947
- Do you have my dad's money?
- No.

342
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:32,851
- Do you have my money?
- Nope.

343
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:34,487
Can I have $10,000?

344
00:16:34,554 --> 00:16:36,190
Not gonna happen, dude.

345
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:38,194
Hey, you sound familiar.

346
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:40,098
Don't have a cow, man.

347
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,639
Is this what
we wanted to happen?

348
00:16:43,706 --> 00:16:47,714
Okay, I know this seems bad,
but... but, uh...

349
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,387
Oh, come on, Mom, you always
see the good in everything.

350
00:16:51,454 --> 00:16:54,193
Well, on the bright side,

351
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,999
if you look at it
a certain way...

352
00:16:57,065 --> 00:16:58,536
there is no bright side!

353
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:01,374
The whole world is one big
criminal organization!

354
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,015
From hedge funds to payday loans
to the NCAA,

355
00:17:05,081 --> 00:17:06,885
it's not just a few bad apples...

356
00:17:06,952 --> 00:17:09,524
It's the whole orchard
that's rotten!

357
00:17:11,027 --> 00:17:12,630
Whoa, gift cards!

358
00:17:12,697 --> 00:17:14,066
Justice wasn't served,

359
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,672
but dinner is.

360
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,278
I can't believe we ate

361
00:17:20,345 --> 00:17:22,951
$500 worth of appetizers.

362
00:17:23,017 --> 00:17:26,558
Revenge sliders
dipped in payback sauce.

363
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:29,864
Honey, you're not
sweating from overeating.

364
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:31,635
What's wrong?

365
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:35,509
These gift cards were obtained
by scamming innocent people.

366
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:37,279
So no, thank you.

367
00:17:37,346 --> 00:17:38,649
You said it yourself...

368
00:17:38,716 --> 00:17:41,387
Everyone in the world
is ripping off everyone else.

369
00:17:41,454 --> 00:17:44,059
Why shouldn't we wet our beaks?

370
00:17:44,126 --> 00:17:47,032
Oh, you got to try
these fried beaks.

371
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,436
Dip the beak!
Dip the beak!

372
00:17:49,504 --> 00:17:52,009
Well, it seems like
no one else has a problem

373
00:17:52,075 --> 00:17:54,848
gorging on
ill-gotten appetizers.

374
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,154
Beak me.

375
00:18:06,938 --> 00:18:09,176
With that deep-fried morsel,

376
00:18:09,243 --> 00:18:12,282
my victory is complete.

377
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:14,086
Uh, we're all seeing

378
00:18:14,153 --> 00:18:17,092
the freak in the sandals, right?

379
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:19,864
Yes, but this can't be real.

380
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:23,906
We probably just ate too many
wasabi mac and cheese balls.

381
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:25,810
Silence, you mewling wretches,

382
00:18:25,876 --> 00:18:29,283
for I am Loki, god of mischief.

383
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:31,788
But I am known by many names

384
00:18:31,855 --> 00:18:33,859
and take many forms.

385
00:18:36,097 --> 00:18:38,367
Buy crypto, suckers!

386
00:18:38,434 --> 00:18:40,573
And my handiwork of deception

387
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:43,712
is woven into the fabric
of the universe.

388
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:46,016
From the Ticketmaster
convenience fee

389
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,522
to the NCAA.

390
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:51,828
Oh, lord of appetizers,
I kneel before you.

391
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:55,368
Who shall I smother with ranch
in your name?

392
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:59,243
Well, Loki, you've already
taken an old man's life savings.

393
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:01,013
What more do you want?

394
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,384
I have come here to...

395
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:04,621
'Zerz...

396
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:06,290
to take my prize:

397
00:19:06,357 --> 00:19:09,463
An honest woman's belief
in the good of mankind.

398
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:12,603
And now, as the old laws demand,

399
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,976
I must bestow
upon the vanquished a kiss.

400
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:17,412
Mwah.

401
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:19,818
There are no old laws.

402
00:19:19,884 --> 00:19:22,122
God of mischief does it again!

403
00:19:22,189 --> 00:19:24,359
Now, off to add
more blackout dates

404
00:19:24,426 --> 00:19:27,065
to Disneyland annual passes.

405
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:32,510
Suckers.

406
00:19:33,311 --> 00:19:35,114
Whoa, that was weird.

407
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:37,219
Should we get the rest to go?

408
00:19:38,522 --> 00:19:41,026
Excuse me, I'm out of gas

409
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:42,697
and left my wallet at home.

410
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:44,132
Would you lend me $20?

411
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:46,237
I'll mail it back to you,
I promise.

412
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:49,109
Uh, I'm sorry,
but that is an obvious scam.

413
00:19:49,176 --> 00:19:50,779
Uh, go find another sucker.

414
00:19:50,846 --> 00:19:53,284
Is this it... from now on,
I live in a world

415
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:56,257
where nobody trusts anybody?

416
00:19:56,323 --> 00:19:58,127
No, not me.

417
00:19:58,194 --> 00:20:00,699
Here's $20 and my address.

418
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,839
I trust that
you'll mail me the money.

419
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,334
I knew it!

420
00:20:18,401 --> 00:20:19,604
Maybe you're right, baby.

421
00:20:19,671 --> 00:20:22,375
There still are some
good people out there.

422
00:20:22,442 --> 00:20:25,683
In your face, god of scams!

423
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:33,364
Well, I'm out another 20 bucks,

424
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:36,337
but I gave them
something to believe in.

425
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:39,142
Suckers.

426
00:20:51,968 --> 00:20:54,272
Your Social Security number
has been compromised.

427
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:55,384
Please give us
your Social Security number

428
00:20:55,408 --> 00:20:57,445
so we can keep it safe.

429
00:20:58,247 --> 00:21:01,353
I met my billionaire boyfriend
on Billionaire Match.

430
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,857
Match with billions
of billionaires

431
00:21:02,923 --> 00:21:05,395
for only $4.95 a month.

432
00:21:06,664 --> 00:21:09,837
If you or your family have used
toilet paper in the last year,

433
00:21:09,904 --> 00:21:13,377
you can join us
in a class action lawsuit.

434
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:16,918
We have found
nude photos of you.

435
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,122
If you want these removed
and/or touched up,

436
00:21:19,189 --> 00:21:21,427
please press 1 now.

437
00:21:22,362 --> 00:21:25,234
This is Jerry
down at whatever bank you use.

438
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:27,038
We lost your PIN number.

439
00:21:27,105 --> 00:21:29,142
Can you send it to us?
