Oh. So I can decide
that all my thoughts from yesterday

140
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,080
are stored in, I don't know, the oven?

141
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,373

[Marge] Whoa!

147
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,429
{\an8}I'm here. I'm here. Bart, what happened?

148
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,472
{\an8}- Splinter.
- Oh.

149
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,433
{\an8}- That's it?
- Well, it's kind of bleeding.

150
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,184
Maybe not.

151
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,145
[gasps] When did your hands get so big?

152
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,813
They're bigger than mine.

153
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,274
I don't know.
Maybe I got freaky-big hands.

154
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,526
Tweeze, please.

155
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:07,199
I guess it's been
a while since we held hands.

156
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,284
- Ew. Did you get it?
- Mmm.

157
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,369
Thanks.

158
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,163
So that's why you're having nightmares.

159
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,124
Bart is super rude and full of splinters.

160
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,250
Maybe.

161
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:20,337
Or maybe I'm just sick
off hubcap hot dogs.

162
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,798
Why would awake-me eat those?

163

That doesn't seem like awake-me.

After enough booze slushies,
you think you can do anything.

165
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,639
I challenged the valet to an arm wrestle

166
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,725
but he turned out to be just a sign.

167
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:39,523
Why was I drinking frozen wine in a casual
dining chain restaurant on a school night?

168
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,817
I don't know.
After our meeting with Bart's teacher,

169
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,318
you said you needed a drink.

170
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,445
[Marge] Hmm.

171
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,697
{\an8}Hmm.

172
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,324
Mmm. Whoa!

173
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,451
- [children laughing, echoing]
- Look, whatever Bart did,

174
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:55,455
we'll pay to have it cleaned or replaced
or for its therapy or...

175
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,332
Bart hasn't done anything.

176
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,793
I'm meeting with all the parents,
even the normal kids. [shouts]

177
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,336
Bart is normal.

178
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,797
I-I mean, we don't say normal anymore.

179
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,882
I mean, I-I'm talking to all the parents.

180
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:06,967
You're not special.

181
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,427
I-I mean, you are. [chuckles] But...

182
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,011
What did you wanna talk about?

183
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,431
As you know, Bounce-A-Thon means

184
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,641
we're getting close
to the end of the year,

185
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:18,562
so it's a good time to talk
about the transition to fifth grade.

186
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:22,357
You know, last year of elementary school,
and then it's on to middle school, then...

187
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,525
Middle school?

188
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,860
[rumbling]

189
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,070
Then everything changes.

190
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,740
- Girls, acne, drugs, body odor.
- [Marge] Hmm?

191
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,951
- [Marge groans]
- Listen, I've taught fifth grade.

192
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,078
Please buy your fifth grader deodorant.

193
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,249
Like, real deodorant,
not the "natural" stuff.

194
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,547
They may look like children,
but they smell like nervous cab drivers.

195
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,799
The point is, don't freak out.

196
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,218
Okay, about what?

197
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,803
Well, some parents start thinking,

198
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,265
"Oh, no, this is the end
of my kid's childhood." [chuckles]

199
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,685
But fifth grade isn't
the end of Bart's childhood. Right?

200
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,938
I mean, technically,
it is the last year of it. [chuckles]

201
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,399
[gasping]

202
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,527
Did you find out what happened to Bart?

203
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,779
It's what's going to happen.

204
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,698
He's going to grow up.

205
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,783
[Homer groans]

206
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,161
Damn kid.

207
00:08:19,122 --> 00:08:21,290
- It was such a strange dream.
- [pen scratching]

208
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:24,710
Bart was four and he was so adorable.

209
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:26,545
I'd almost forgotten there was a time

210
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:30,383
when Bart was the sweet one
and Lisa was the difficult one.

211
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,427
Uh, to be fair, I'm only 18 months old,

212
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:39,058
so to be going through my terrible twos
now is actually pretty advanced. [grunts]

213
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,851
Crap, I'm still dreaming.

214
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:41,937
[gasps]

215
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,605
Bounce-A-Thon!

216
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:46,983
I'm coming too.

217
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,317
- [Lisa] Yay!
- [Bart] Aren't you sick?

218
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:49,568
I thought I heard you barfing.

219
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:51,904
{\an8}No, that wasn't barfing.

220
00:08:51,905 --> 00:08:54,782
{\an8}That was loud, sloshy burps...

221
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,826
{\an8}- [gags, gulps]
- [both groan]

222
00:08:56,827 --> 00:09:00,371
I signed up for snacks,
so I have to make marshmallow treat...

223
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:02,415
[gags] I can do this.

224
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,583
Just have to melt some margar... [gags]

225
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:08,754
Don't worry. Super-Dad is already making
the marshmallow treats.

226
00:09:08,755 --> 00:09:10,798
Which Krispies did you use?

227
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,174
Rice or Cocoa?

228
00:09:12,175 --> 00:09:13,259
I'm making my own.

229
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,929
The rice is "krispying" as we speak.

230
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:19,432
- Whoa.
- [gags] Oh, it smells like you burnt it.

231
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,977
No problem. I'll moisten it
with the last of the eggnog.

232
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:25,188
[Marge groans, gags]

233
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,483
I'm throwing up stuff I ate years ago.

234
00:09:29,484 --> 00:09:31,902
I think I saw wedding cake.

235
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,071
You really should stay home.

236
00:09:34,072 --> 00:09:36,490
[sighs] Maybe you're right. [groans]

237
00:09:36,491 --> 00:09:39,702
This will be the first Bounce-A-Thon
I've ever missed.

238
00:09:39,703 --> 00:09:41,620
Oh, missing stuff is the greatest.

239
00:09:41,621 --> 00:09:43,205
When I do stuff,

240
00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:45,458
I have a fear
of missing out on missing out.

241
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,460
You know, FO-MOO-MO.

242
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:50,004
Homer, listen, you have to do this for me.

243
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:54,633
Take a picture of each kid
giving a thumbs-up at the finish line.

244
00:09:54,634 --> 00:09:56,385
{\an8}It's for my scrapbook.

245
00:09:56,386 --> 00:09:59,305
I've already made
windows for each school year.

246
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:03,059
[groans] Bart, thumbs-up
slowly past Daddy.

247
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,561
Give him time to focus.

248
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:10,608
Mom, there's no easy way to tell you this,
so I'm just gonna say it.

249
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:13,486
At school, I'm becoming
known for taking cutting-edge,

250
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,488
no-holds-barred comedy photos.

251
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,572
It's true.

252
00:10:16,573 --> 00:10:19,158
I've heard fifth graders say so.

253
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,577
So, w-what are... what are you saying?

254
00:10:21,578 --> 00:10:24,580
There's no way I can do
a thumbs-up at Bounce-A-Thon.

255
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:25,664
What?

256
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:28,667
It will ruin the brand
I've been building since picture day.

257
00:10:28,668 --> 00:10:32,880
My fans expect me to top
inside-out eyelids and Scotch Tape nose.

258
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:34,924
You don't understand
the pressure I'm under.

259
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:40,012
{\an8}But this is for the Bounce-A-Thon album.
So you'll always remember Bounce-A-Thon.

260
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:43,099
But... [sighs] ...I don't
even like Bounce-A-Thon.

261
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,018
I'm making fun of Bounce-A-Thon.

262
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:47,436
{\an8}What?

263
00:10:47,437 --> 00:10:51,857
None of us kids like Bounce-A-Thon.
It's not very cool.

264
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:53,944
Well, you thought it was cool last year.

265
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:59,365
Bart, just one thumbs-up, please.

266
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:04,662
[sighs] I'm sorry, but no.
Crazy pictures is my thing now.

267
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:08,124
You should respect
that this is just how I am this year.

268
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,420
Bart, you sound so mature and grown-up.

269
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:14,713
[sobbing] I hate that.

270
00:11:14,714 --> 00:11:17,049
[sobs]

271
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,136
[snores]

272
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,637
[crickets chirping]

273
00:11:21,638 --> 00:11:23,180
- [creature growls]
- [Marge gasps]

274
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:24,890
[Homer's voice] Run! Something's coming!

275
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:26,392
- [Marge gasps]
- [creature growls]

276
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:27,644
[Marge panting]

277
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:31,188
- This is silly. I don't need symbolism.
- [growling]

278
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:33,441
I know what I'm afraid of
and it's not a bear.

279
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,733
- [bear grunts]
- Sorry.

280
00:11:34,734 --> 00:11:37,069
[bear grunts, mutters]

281
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,905
[sighs] It's not a nightmare.

282
00:11:39,906 --> 00:11:42,700
It's reality. Bart's growing up.

283
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:46,412
I should have treasured
every time he held my hand,

284
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:49,582
because I don't remember when he stopped.

285
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,711
The poet Khalil LeBron once said,

286
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:58,132
"Parents are bows...
like bow-and-arrow bows"...

287
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:59,216
[Marge] Hmm.

288
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:03,054
..."from which children are shot forth
as an arrow thingy."

289
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:08,684
The bow doesn't feel sad when it sees
how far and true the arrow flies.

290
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:11,729
Well, the bow feels a little sad.

291
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,772
The bow doesn't wanna lose touch,

292
00:12:13,773 --> 00:12:17,110
and the arrow has never been great
about answering texts.

293
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:22,364
But even after Bart grows up,
you'll still have Lisa and Maggie.

294
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:28,162
Oh, my God. Lisa and Maggie. It's going
to happen with all of them. [groans]

295
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:29,246
- Oops.
- [Marge groans]

296
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:30,956
[rumbling]

297
00:12:30,957 --> 00:12:32,792
Bart is just the beginning.

298
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,506
[echoing] One by one...

299
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,927
all my babies will leave the nest.

300
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:46,890
[echoing] I'm gonna lose all of them.

301
00:12:55,815 --> 00:12:59,401
Honey, we mustn't break awake-you's brain.

302
00:12:59,402 --> 00:13:03,405
Remember those commercials where they
show you what depression is like?

303
00:13:03,406 --> 00:13:07,785
A rain cloud follows you everywhere.
You get sucked into sofas.

304
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:11,581
And when it gets really bad,
your windup monkey stops clapping.

305
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:13,249
[gasps]

306
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,459
Look. Look, Bart's at a playground.

307
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,129
Bart. Bart, they have your favorite
back-and-forth riding thingy.

308
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,633
[muffled] The duck, Bart. Ride the duck!

309
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,426
[muffled] Bart!

310
00:13:25,178 --> 00:13:28,431
No!

311
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:30,891
[children chattering]

312
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:33,937
Okay. Maybe I am
being a teensy bit negative.

313
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:42,527
[Homer's voice] Okay.
A little brain hurricane.

314
00:13:42,528 --> 00:13:46,781
My time as a mom
will eventually come to an end.

315
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:50,535
I'll have to fill my days
with a bunch of stupid hobbies.

316
00:13:50,536 --> 00:13:53,538
I don't want an Etsy storefront!

317
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:58,084
It's not happening now
so it's silly to be sad about it now.

318
00:13:58,085 --> 00:14:02,672
It's like going to work on time.
There's no point.

319
00:14:02,673 --> 00:14:04,967
I wanna show you something. [grunting]

320
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:09,637
[grunting]

321
00:14:09,638 --> 00:14:10,806
[Marge] Whoa!

322
00:14:12,558 --> 00:14:13,933
I'm coming too.

323
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:15,309
- [Lisa] Yay!
- [Bart] Aren't you sick?

324
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,561
I thought I heard you barfing.

325
00:14:16,562 --> 00:14:18,187
- Freeze it right there.
- [tape clicks]

326
00:14:18,188 --> 00:14:23,109
Now, watch it again.
But this time, look over here.

327
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,695
[tape rewinds]

328
00:14:25,654 --> 00:14:27,029
I'm coming too.

329
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,114
Yay!

330
00:14:28,115 --> 00:14:33,953
[singsongy] Mommy's coming. Yes, she is.
Do-do-do-do-do. My mom. Uh-huh!

331
00:14:33,954 --> 00:14:36,747
She's rehearsing her thumbs-up.

332
00:14:36,748 --> 00:14:37,999
Oh.

333
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,294
Oh, I was so sad that Bart
had outgrown the Bounce-A-Thon

334
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:44,839
I couldn't see
that my sweet Lisa still loves it.

335
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,301
For now.
Next year she'll probably turn on it too.

336
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:51,137
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you
to get out of the dark place, please.

337
00:14:51,138 --> 00:14:55,892
[grunts] You're right.
Bounce-A-Thon still means a lot to Lisa.

338
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:59,186
So, what are you?
Like, my feelings police?

339
00:14:59,187 --> 00:15:00,271
[chuckling] No,

340
00:15:00,272 --> 00:15:03,608
I'm pretty sure I'm here 'cause,
deep down, you're attracted to me.

341
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:08,738
The uniform, the low center of gravity,
my thick syrupy voice. Heh.

342
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:10,489
I don't think so.

343
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,074
If anything, I'm into Eddie.

344
00:15:12,075 --> 00:15:14,577
Yeah, he's a beautiful man.

345
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:18,956
I love that Lisa was so happy
I was gonna be there.

346
00:15:18,957 --> 00:15:21,167
I should be there for her.

347
00:15:21,168 --> 00:15:25,713
I've got to get to the Bounce-A-Thon
before Lisa's childhood slips away.

348
00:15:25,714 --> 00:15:27,341
How could I wake myself up?

349
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:29,301
Oh, well, this will do it.

350
00:15:32,471 --> 00:15:33,639
[gasps, grunts]

351
00:15:34,806 --> 00:15:37,351
Okay. Looking good. Feeling good.

352
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:38,893

[retches]

354
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,481
Even better now.

355
00:15:43,482 --> 00:15:46,901
[pants] I'll be there, Lisa.
I won't miss it.

356

[retches]

361
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:04,585
Okay, I ruined the car.
But Mommy's s-still coming, Lisa.

362
00:16:04,586 --> 00:16:05,671
[gasps]

363
00:16:06,254 --> 00:16:07,422
Okay, here we go.

364
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:12,468
Oh, I gotta sign up. Okay. Username?

365
00:16:12,469 --> 00:16:14,720
Uh, uh. Bounce-Mom.

366
00:16:14,721 --> 00:16:16,263
Taken. Fine.

367
00:16:16,264 --> 00:16:18,391
Uh, Barf-Mom.

368
00:16:18,392 --> 00:16:20,059
Taken, really?

369
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,103
Borf-Mom.

370
00:16:22,104 --> 00:16:24,188
What? Oh, come on.

371
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:27,693
Marge. Oh, that worked.

372
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,491

[shouts, pants]

376
00:16:42,624 --> 00:16:43,792
I'm here, Lisa.

377
00:16:44,501 --> 00:16:45,751
[upbeat music playing on speakers]

378
00:16:45,752 --> 00:16:51,382
I promised to wear this humorous wig for
Bounce-A-Thon if we had 30 lice-free days

379
00:16:51,383 --> 00:16:56,012
and, uh, well, we had 29 but I'm just
gonna assume that today is gonna go well.

380
00:16:56,013 --> 00:17:00,057
"And on the bounce track right now,
the second grade."

381
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:01,726
[gasps] That's Lisa's class.

382

[Principal Skinner grunts]

384
00:17:04,896 --> 00:17:06,981
[Marge] Excuse me.
Excuse me, let me through.

385
00:17:06,982 --> 00:17:09,191
I'm here to support my child.

386
00:17:09,192 --> 00:17:14,405
Yeah. Well, guess what, Princess Blue?
We're all here to support our kids.

387
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:17,116
So stick that in your G-string
and make change.

388
00:17:17,117 --> 00:17:20,202
I'm sorry.
I'm very, very sick, and I just...

389
00:17:20,203 --> 00:17:22,538
Sick? W-W-What kind of sick?

390
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:27,710
I don't know. Some kind of, um,
I don't know, pox or plague.

391
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:29,420
- [parents muttering]
- [Kirk] Oh, boy.

392
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:30,505
[Marge chuckles]

393
00:17:32,215 --> 00:17:37,888
[sniffs, groans] Oh, no. Food smells.
It's okay. I'll just hold my breath.

394
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:40,474
- [person 1] Mmm.
- [person 2] Churro.

395
00:17:41,975 --> 00:17:44,560
- [person 3] Seafood.
- [person 4] What are you gonna get?

396
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:46,145
[person 5] Or should I have sushi?

397
00:17:46,146 --> 00:17:48,564
Must get picture.

398
00:17:48,565 --> 00:17:49,775
[gagging]

399
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:57,156
[Ms. Peyton, echoing] Mrs. Simpson?

400
00:17:57,157 --> 00:17:58,240
[Marge, echoing] Huh?

401
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:00,409
Did... Did I get the picture?

402
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,494
[grunts]

403
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:03,829
[groaning] No. Huh?

404
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,499
I took a photo after I passed out?

405
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,169
Yeah. We had to pry the phone
from your hand.

406
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,089
I've been kind of a wreck
since our meeting.

407
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,258
You know,
when you said Bart's childhood is over.

408
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:20,012
[gasps] I did not say that.
I would never say that.

409
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:22,681
Bart's childhood isn't over.

410
00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:27,770
I did notice that you got very quiet
after I mentioned middle school.

411
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:29,647
You didn't say anything else.

412
00:18:29,648 --> 00:18:32,858
Except to ask about happy hour
at Tuesday O'Fridayhans.

413
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:38,197
Wait, you didn't say he was
heading toward girls and drugs and acne?

414
00:18:38,198 --> 00:18:40,866
No, of course not.

415
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:42,868
Oh, my gosh. That was a dream.

416
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:46,247
I should have noticed
that you were 17' tall.

417
00:18:46,248 --> 00:18:49,126
I ate bad things last night.

418
00:18:49,626 --> 00:18:52,628
And you didn't say we needed
to buy Bart deodorant next year.

419
00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:56,048
Oh, no, no, no. I did say that.
That part is very important.

420
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:58,759
Strong deodorant.

421
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,346
Hey. Bart's got a lot of childhood left.

422
00:19:02,347 --> 00:19:07,309
I mean, he scores in the 50th percentile
for knowing his right and left which is...

423
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:12,231
oh, not a test score I should have said
out loud at a school function. [sighs]

424
00:19:12,232 --> 00:19:13,858
Are you going to be okay?

425
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:19,864
Yes. I'm just gonna lie here
until the school stops spinning.

426
00:19:19,865 --> 00:19:21,782
[snores]

427
00:19:21,783 --> 00:19:23,075
[breathes deeply]

428
00:19:23,076 --> 00:19:24,368
Feeling better?

429
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:25,744
[Marge] Mm-hmm.

430
00:19:25,745 --> 00:19:30,541
I missed the picture,
but Lisa was so happy to see me today.

431
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:32,710
So for now, I'm happy.

432
00:19:32,711 --> 00:19:34,712
And who knows what the future holds?

433
00:19:34,713 --> 00:19:36,755
Bart could knock up
his high school girlfriend.

434
00:19:36,756 --> 00:19:39,967
You could have grandchildren
before Maggie starts kindergarten.

435
00:19:39,968 --> 00:19:42,679
Wouldn't that be nice? Mmm.

436
00:19:46,057 --> 00:19:48,518
[sighs] Time to wake up. [grunts]

437
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:51,521
[gasps, sighs]

438
00:19:53,607 --> 00:19:54,858
Here he comes.

439
00:19:56,193 --> 00:19:58,862
Mmm. My funny little guy.

440
00:20:02,949 --> 00:20:05,618
[crowd gasps]

441
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:07,995
- [laughing] Th... Th...
- [Homer] Huh?

442
00:20:07,996 --> 00:20:11,999
- Th-That's really good. [laughs]
- [Homer, Lisa chuckle]

443
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,336
[pants] Did you get the picture?
Was my crack centered?

444
00:20:15,337 --> 00:20:18,088
Oh, Bart. It was perfect.

445
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:19,673
You liked it?

446
00:20:19,674 --> 00:20:21,675
I loved it!

447
00:20:21,676 --> 00:20:22,968
Thanks.

448
00:20:22,969 --> 00:20:26,096
Wanna go to the dunk tank?
The gym teacher I hate is on the chair.

449
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:27,181
Sure.

450
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:28,600
Oh.

451
00:20:29,517 --> 00:20:30,602
[Bart chuckles]

452
00:20:31,102 --> 00:20:33,813
[sniffles] Let's dunk that sucker.

453
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:40,987
[sniffs] And on the way home,
let's go deodorant shopping.
