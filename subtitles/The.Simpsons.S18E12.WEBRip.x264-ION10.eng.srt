183

189
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,421

knew all the lost tribes.

200
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,534

Not even close.

In the name of the Great Turtle,
will you answer the question?

209
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:13,215
We were south... west of...
North Dakota-lahoma.

210
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,352
Hmm.

211
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,558
Very good.

212
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,469
Well, I better
get to my office

213
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,018

Utah.

357
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,939
Utah?

358
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,273
Home of America’s
most powerful weirdos?

359
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,398
Our lives could be
so wonderful there.

360
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,528
(serene music)

361
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,956
(gargling)

362
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,754
Oh, Bart.

363
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,495
You are an extreme husband

364
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,297
and an extreme father.

365
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,052
Awesome!

366
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,510
(tense Native American music)

367
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,190
The people of my tribe lived
in harmony with the land.

368
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,690
Eating mock buffalo steaks
made from

369
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,073
peaceful turnip roots,

370
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,280
uh, they...

371
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,571
Environment...

372
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,784
uh, dignity...

373
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,695
Corn god...

374
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,164
(groans):
I’m sorry, I can’t do this!

375
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,285
I made it all up!

376
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,081
There is no Hitachee tribe.

377
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,674
I took the name
from my microwave.

378
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,249
(crowd murmuring)

379
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,464
But surely you can forgive
a little girl who...

380
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,506
(screams)

381
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,258
Wait, wait.

382
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,800
Although she is not
one of our people,

383
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,973
this young lady
has shown the courage

384
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,892
we Native Americans cherish.

385
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,891
And who can blame her
for wanting to be one of us?

386
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,233
We have a noble heritage
and cheekbones to die for.

387
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,809
(cheering)

388
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,194
I’m not Native American, either.

389
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,481
I just ski a lot.

390
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,614
(crowd gasps)

391
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,860
I’m Japanese.

392
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,321
Well, I’m an Aborigine.

393
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,951
I’m two midgets
in a costume.

394
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,239
What?
Not you, Fibbing Bear?!

395
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:17,044
(clamoring)

396
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,579
You know, my great-great
grandmother <i>was </i>an Indian.

397
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,754
I guess I should’ve
mentioned that before, huh?

398
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,083
Yes, you should have!

399
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,088
(screams)

400
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,129
Bart, sweetie.

401
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,973
I need some
strawberries.

402
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,969
Mm-hmm. I bet they
sell them in Utah.

403
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,051
Bart, I need
some strawberries.

404
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,346
Right now.

405
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,809
We’re in the middle
of the desert.

406
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,849
I need strawberries!

407
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,182
BART:
Take my wife...

408
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,557
please.

409
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,603
Hey, I finally get that joke.

410
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,057
-(smack)
-Ow!

411
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,647
I just found this note
in Bart’s room.

412
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,235
"Dear Mom and Dad,
me and my girlfriend Darcy

413
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,161
have gone to Utah
to get married.

414
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,619
FYI: she’s pregnant."

415
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,040
(chuckling):
Oh.

416
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,039
Simpson men get the job done.

417
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,041
(groans)

418
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,082
It’s a tragedy,
a real tragedy.

419
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,286
I mean, what kind of tramp
gets knocked up

420
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,956
before she’s even married?

421
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,505
I did.

422
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,798
I mean in this day and age,

423
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,932
when the link between sex
and pregnancy has been proven

424
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,930
so... conclusively...

425
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,313
in <i>Scientific American,</i>
where...

426
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,612
Okay, we can trace
where the kids are

427
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,979
by the charges
they made on your card.

428
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,447
In Colorado, they charged
$200 worth of bubble gum.

429
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,489
Actually,

430
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,371
that was me.

431
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,789
"Dingle’s Berries"
in Provo, Utah?

432
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,248
Why would I go to Utah?

433
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,748
I love booze,
caffeine and monogamy.

434
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,671
Then that must be it.

435
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,210
Our daughter says she’s
run off with your son.

436
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,844
Did she mention
she was knocked up?

437
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,551
-No!
-Oops! Sorry for the spoiler.

438
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,349
So how many brides will you
be marrying today, Mr. Simpson?

439
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,220
Just one.

440
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,596
(scoffs):
What are you, gay?

441
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,639
Stop the wedding!

442
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,107
Bart, you’re too young
to get married.

443
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:11,018
You still make me check
the closet for the boogeyman.

444
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,318
Well, maybe I found
someone else to do it for me.

445
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,492
Someone who will do
a more thorough job.

446
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,201
I don’t care
how young he is,

447
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,951
he took advantage of a girl
five years older than him.

448
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,913
Utah karate!

449
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:27,787
(intense drum music)

450
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,955
(grunts)

451
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,167
(groans)

452
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,594
Dad, lay off
the Bartman.

453
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,802
He’s not the father.

454
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,382
I just wanted to marry him,

455
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,336
so you and Mom
wouldn’t be ashamed of me.

456
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,597
Ashamed?

457
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,178
I’m thrilled...

458
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,563
because I’m gonna
have a baby, too!

459
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,310
CROWD:
Aw...

460
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,232
We can lie to the neighbors
and tell them they’re twins.

461
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,902
Awesome idea, Dad.

462
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,270
I guess this is
the end for us, Bart.

463
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,727
Thanks for everything.

464
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,647
Darcy, in 50 years,

465
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,566
you might see me
walking down the street

466
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,824
and you’ll wonder,
"Is that Bart?"

467
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,657
And I’ll go...
(armpit farts)

468
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,122
and you’ll know.

469
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,832
BOTH: (giggling)

470
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,207
You know,
I thought Darcy and I

471
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,171
would be like
a real married couple.

472
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,381
Instead we just ended up
fighting all the time.

473
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,093
Uh yeah, how ’bout that?

474
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,884
You know, for a while,

475
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,637
I was kind of looking
forward to being a dad.

476
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,520
Son, one day you’re going
to be a great father.

477
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,849
Aw...

478
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,644
And someday
you’ll be one, too.

479
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,017
Thanks, boy.

480
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,563
(chuckles jovially)

481
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,727
Hey, for old time’s sake,
you want to drive me around

482
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,526
while I sing public domain songs
out the window?

483
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,531
You got it.
