00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,943
Ah.

174
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,655
(gasps) Hmm.

175
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,947
-(rhythmic thudding)
-Now I'm gonna test

176
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,038
just how deeply
Homer's mind has been effected.

177
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,333
Take a sip of this, young man.

178
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,297
(coughing)

179
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,048
Ew! Gross!

180
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,470
-What did you give him?
-Beer.

181
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,879
(all gasp)

182
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,587
This hypnotism is strong.

183
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,097
Dinner theater strong.

184
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,599
My husband can't really think he's ten.

185
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,231
I'm saying he so desperately
needs to believe he's ten,

186
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,559
that only the original hypnotist
who did this can undo the trance

187
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,186
without risking permanent damage
to Homer's psyche.

188
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,823
(laughs)

189
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,070
(in high-pitched voice)
Hey, oh, help me!

190
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,113
-Dear God.
-Psych!

191
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,777
Oops.

192
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,695
-So, what do we do?
-Do not force the truth.

193
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,325
For now, treat Homer just as you would
a regular ten-year-old boy.

194
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,503
-Can he be nine so I can beat him up?
-No, I'm afraid not.

195
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,673
The rules of hypnotism are inflexible.

196
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,382
Then can we get pizza
on the way home?

197
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,922
Ask for boogers on Bart's half.

198
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,335
(laughs) Good one.

199
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,763
Booger pizza.

200
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,931
You better pray they find
that hypnotist, Marge.

201
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,261
HOMER:
Get the ball, boy! Come on.

202
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,756
-(squeaking)
-Go get it, boy!

203
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,517
(barking)

204
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,690
Go get it, boy.

205
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,268
(whines)

206
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,613
-Go get it, boy!
-(snarls, barking)

207
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,609
Hey! Ow! Ow!

208
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,481
I thought you were my best friend.

209
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,278
-(barking)
-Ooh! Ow-Ow!

210
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,911
So, where is he gonna sleep?

211
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,119
Well, I guess it'll have to be
in Bart's room.

212
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,950
Oh. And I thought when Homer
cut off his thumb was bad.

213
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,367
-Um, Mrs. Simpson?
-Aah!

214
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,921
(laughing)

215
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,052
MARGE: Oh!

216
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,879
(snoring)

217
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,469
(groans) Hey? What? Who?

218
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,063
Homer, can't you sleep with Mom?

219
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,769
I'd be too nervous.

220
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,559
Have you noticed
that she's kind of hot?

221
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,943
Gross! Weird! Complicated!

222
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,731
Go to sleep.

223
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,234
(grumbles)

224
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,736
I really do miss my Homie
this time of night.

225
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,529
Hmm.

226
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,203
Hmm. Hmm.

227
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,702
Mm-hmm.

228
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,539
We're gonna have
a lot of mittens this winter.

229
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,873
(birds singing)

230
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,457
Aw, if I'm gonna get through this day,

231
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,753
I better Irish up my coffee.

232
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,844
I'm ready to go to school.

233
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,005
Homer, you're not going to school.

234
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,934
I'm not? Cool! Am I sick?

235
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,023
'Cause if I'm sick,
I get to stay home and make s'mores.

236
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,849
All I need is graham crackers, chocolate,

237
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,734
{\an8}marshmallows, sticks, fire...
Did I say graham crackers?

238
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,772
{\an8}Chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire...

239
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,936
{\an8}Oops! My homework.

240
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,525
{\an8}Fine, you can go to school.

241
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,201
Yo, this is tunnel tag.

242
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,619
When you're tagged,
you have to spread your legs and freeze.

243
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,368
{\an8}Guess I chose the wrong day
to wear culottes.

244
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,661
{\an8}Every day's the wrong day
to wear culottes.

245
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,905
{\an8}-You're it!
-(kids laughing, clamoring)

246
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,877
-(kids gasp)
-Can I play?

247
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,039
Oh, God, no.

248
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,054
If Milhouse can play,
anyone can play.

249
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,893
Once again,
I'm the lower bound.

250
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,349
-You're it!
-(kids laughing, clamoring)

251
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,140
Is that a grown man

252
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,434
going between the children's legs?

253
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,268
{\an8}Well, there's nothing
in the rule book against it.

254
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,063
{\an8}It's on page one of the rule book!

255
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,517
That's where I doodle.

256
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,237
It's a comic strip I do called
<i>Bumble and Grumble.</i>

257
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,778
Grumble likes to yell,

258
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,451
but deep down he loves
Bumble like a son.

259
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,831
No, he doesn't.

260
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,158
HOMER: I'm beat.

261
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,743
(yawns)

262
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,578
-Today was fun.
-Yeah.

263
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,794
Listen, Homer,
do you ever think about

264
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,504
what you want to do
when you're grown up?

265
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,754
I'll eat in bed.

266
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,166
Not just snacks,
messy stuff like lasagna.

267
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,216
Oh, and the TV would be on. Loud.

268
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,680
Hey, would you ever want
to have a real job and a family?

269
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,972
(scoffs)
Wife? Three kids? Steady job?

270
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,887
If I did, I'd secretly be very sad.

271
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,307
You could tell by how much
I would eat and drink

272
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,356
-and just sit on the couch.
-(gasps)

273
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,900
Yeah, thank God that never happened.

274
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,074
(snoring)

275
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,573
{\an8}Wow.

276
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:22,034
{\an8}He doesn't want to be my dad.
He just wants to be a kid like me.

277
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,986
{\an8}Almost makes me not want to prank him.

278
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,406
{\an8}Almost.

279
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,789
(grunting)

280
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,709
(snoring)

281
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,554
Touché.

282
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,882
(bicycle bell rings)

283
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,048
(kids grunting)

284
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,392
If you wedgie me,
my friend will beat you up.

285
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,385
That's not your friend.
It's your screwed-up dad.

286
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,978
Pretty sad, really.

287
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,482
We'll leave you alone.

288
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,145
{\an8}You did it, Homer!
You saved me from the bullies!

289
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,364
{\an8}You're the coolest kid I ever met.

290
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,195
What about me?

291
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,740
-You're in the top 100.
-Boo-yah!

292
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,744
-Now you're not.
-(groans) Oh.

293
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,696
(laughter)

294
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,541
(confused grunts)

295
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,884
(laughter)

296
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,551
-(Homer yells)
-(Bart screams)

297
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,721
(groans)

298
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,399
HOMER: Uh, Lisa,

299
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,731
your ma says I should
do something with you.

300
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,607
Need some help
with your homework?

301
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,743
-I'm done.
-Want to see me make a muscle?

302
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,531
Mm, not right now.

303
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,164
Well, that's everything
I know that girls like.

304
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,452
Listen, Homer,

305
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,116
I just want to take advantage
of this opportunity

306
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,955
to have you enjoy
my saxophone with me.

307
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,041
Okay.

308
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,495
(saxophone playing "Baker Street")

309
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,916
(vocalizing along)

310
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,898
Ah, thank God they pulled that
other safety inspector out of retirement.

311
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:21,072
(Homer continues vocalizing)

312
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:24,741
You know, you're the closest thing
I've ever had to a brother.

313
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,532
Me, too. You know what?

314
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,075
I'm afraid you might change back.

315
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,869
-Change back to what?
-(sighs)

316
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,913
Look in the lake,
tell me what you see.

317
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,117
Bloated corpse under the water.

318
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,497
I'd say he's been there
a few months at least.

319
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:41,005
Interesting the way
his lips move just like mine.

320
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,258
Why do you ask?

321
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,679
Uh, no reason, brother.

322
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,345
(laughing)

323
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,642
(laughing)

324
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,097
(coughing)

325
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,187
(gurgling)

326
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,783
Chief, I hope this is the call
I've been praying for.

327
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,240
It is.
We have captured Sven Golly,

328
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:09,031
using a specially dedicated
anti-hypnosis squad.

329
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,581
Well, bring him here now.
I want my Homie back.

330
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,172
I miss him and the things he did.

331
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,916
Lis, you know how Dad thinks
he's a ten-year-old?

332
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,172
I've been emotionally dealing
with that all week, so yes.

333
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,425
Well, now that hypnotist is gonna
come back and snap him out of it!

334
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,838
Look, Dad had to get cured sometime.

335
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,598
There's nothing we can do about it.

336
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,519
Or isn't there not?

337
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,269
WIGGUM: All right, Sven Golly,

338
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,901
you're gonna untangle
this guy's noodle, and that's it--

339
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,768
no more hypnotizing anyone.

340
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:43,105
You have my word...
Chief Kangaroo!

341
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,152
Boing, boing, boing, boing, boing...

342
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,445
(groans)

343
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,162
-(wind whistling)
-(gasps)

344
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,581
They've run away!

345
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,750
