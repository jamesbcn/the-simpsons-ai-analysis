1
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,413
So Ionic.

2
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,917
If I wanted to be bored
on a Saturday, I would have

3
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:19,062
signed up for that management
training program at work.

4
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:22,823
At least there I know
where the good toilets are.

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,658
Wait, what training program?

6
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,793
Oh, it's some dumb
career development thing

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,795
at the plant,
so you can become a manager

8
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,265
and have more responsibility.

9
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,533
Who needs that trap?

10
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,768
But we could really
use more money.

11
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,771
You've had the same entry‐level
job your whole career.

12
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,773
Hey, don't knock
entry level, Marge.

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,676
At least I don't have
to wear long‐sleeve shirts,

14
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:45,512
go to webinars
and supervise a bunch

15
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,581
of entry‐level losers,

16
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,716
with their short‐sleeve shirts.

17
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,786
Homer, I can't be
the only one in this family

18
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:55,022
who wants more for us.

19
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,657
I want more.

20
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,892
I just don't want
to do anything to earn it.

21
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,594
For once in your life,

22
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:03,063
would it kill you
to show a little ambition?

23
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:08,735
Ah, ambition is indeed
a timeless source of conflict.

24
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,604
A lost senior.

25
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:13,273
Where is your family?

26
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,609
As a matter of fact,
I just curated

27
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,644
an exhibit about a Roman family

28
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,347
torn asunder
by the hunger for more.

29
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,517
The Life of Obeseus the Wide.

30
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,386
Ooh, maybe
an historical allegory

31
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,522
could help us
work out our issues.

32
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,123
Once again, bickering in public

33
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,859
gets us free therapy
from strangers.

34
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,628
Bickering most tragic.

35
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:38,865
For ambition was the force
that built the Roman Empire

36
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,268
and that which tore it apart.

37
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,670
Obeseus was born
to a poor farmer

38
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:46,506
with much land,
but no ox to plow it.

39
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,276
So he improvised.

40
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,311
Life on the farm was cruel.

41
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:53,847
But it chiseled
young Obeseus into quite

42
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:56,149
the Italian beefcake.

43
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,618
Good news, plow son.

44
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,687
We finally got enough money
to buy us an ox.

45
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,956
How'd you do that, father?

46
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:04,625
I sold you into slavery.

47
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,094
Arrivederci, sucker.

48
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,065
A frightened Obeseus

49
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,834
and his new work friends

50
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,535
were taken to Rome.

51
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,872
The boys had never seen
anything like it, the crowds,

52
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,507
the noise, the grand scale

53
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:23,410
of the pornographic graffiti.

54
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,380
But the worst was yet to come.

55
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,515
Gentlemen,
today you have the honor

56
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:31,551
of being hacked to death
on the field of battle.

57
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:34,154
Us? But we're not gladiators.

58
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:35,689
Not with that attitude.

59
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:38,125
Remember, there are
no small wounds,

60
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,261
only small victims.

61
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,802
Hailing from Germania,

62
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:52,039
he's the Saxon
who's always axe‐in'...

63
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,708
Wolfus Rein!

64
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,078
And in the shaking tunic,

65
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,681
hailing from who knows,
nobody cares...

66
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,683
that guy.

67
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,956
Someone's in here.

68
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,532
Obeseus didn't know much,

69
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,667
but he knew how to be an ox.

70
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,509
Juno, Mother of Apollo.

71
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,879
All right, pal,
should we call it a tie?

72
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,685
All hail our new champion,

73
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,554
Mr. Plow himself,

74
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,856
Obeseus!

75
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:45,125
Yeah!

76
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,729
That chiseled bumpkin
just killed

77
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,864
my prized psychopath.

78
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,666
Feed him to the hippos.

79
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,402
No, Father, look how
the crowd loves him.

80
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:58,872
That hunky rube could put
a lot of togas in the seats.

81
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:02,075
Majora, you have quite the mind

82
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:04,211
for the family business.

83
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,814
The man‐ox will live
to fight another day.

84
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,487
Obeseus' fame grew

85
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,989
as he rose through
the gladiatorial ranks.

86
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,657
Women wanted him

87
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,560
and men wanted
to be killed by him.

88
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,265
But still he yearned for that

89
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,200
which he longed for.

90
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,704
Eye... heart... U!

91
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,912
You guys think
we'll ever be free again?

92
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,981
The only way
we're leaving this place

93
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,116
is carried out in chunks.

94
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:44,785
Don't mind me, fellas.

95
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,953
Another clog in the chunk chute.

96
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,257
They got to start cutting
you guys into smaller pieces.

97
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,959
Let us make a sacred pact
before the gods.

98
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,661
If one of us ever gets free,

99
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,597
he'll do everything he can
to free the rest of us.

100
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,232
To freedom.

101
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,534
To freedom!

102
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,103
Yeah, to freedom.

103
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,206
You chunks are no fun.

104
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:10,377
Well, if it isn't
the champion of Rome himself.

105
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,046
Lady Majora.

106
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:14,614
What are you doing here?

107
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:18,185
I have to keep an eye
on my father's investments.

108
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,453
Plus, I like the way
your pecs dance

109
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,189
after you kill a guy.

110
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,257
These old things?

111
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,694
Blip, blip, bla‐bla, blip,
blip, bla‐bla, blip.

112
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,636
Swish and slash
and spin and kick

113
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,806
and slice that belly
and hello, guts.

114
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,008
It would appear that one
of you lowly gladiators

115
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:45,378
has impregnated my daughter.

116
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,813
Tell me who laid with her,

117
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,217
and the rest of you
will be spared the lash.

118
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,521
I had sexicus.

119
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:58,225
- I had sexicus.
- I had sexicus.

120
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,293
I had sexicus.

121
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,529
- I had sexicus.
- I had sexicus.

122
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,064
I had sexicus.

123
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,432
You jerks!

124
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,067
You knew I liked her.

125
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,536
We were covering
for you, jackass.

126
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:10,670
Oh, right.

127
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,339
Sir, I'm in love
with your daughter.

128
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,941
If you must punish someone,
punish me.

129
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:18,545
Place his head
on the beheading block.

130
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,451
Which is also
the unlocking block.

131
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,387
Rise, for you are now free...

132
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:31,091
to marry my daughter.

133
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,493
I mean, great.

134
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,030
What could be more
liberating than marriage?

135
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,666
The young lovers were wed
for all the gods to see.

136
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,769
And plans were made
for their future.

137
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:45,038
So that you may
build a life together,

138
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:48,475
I give you the deed
to one of my many businesses.

139
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,510
Oh, thank you, Daddy.

140
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,979
I have so many great ideas.

141
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:56,149
Oh, my little vestal non‐virgin,

142
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,852
leave the business talk
to the men.

143
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:04,190
Now, Obeseus,
to get things started,

144
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,094
please, take some slaves
on the house.

145
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,231
Aw, slaves?
You shouldn't ha...

146
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,333
I can't own my friends.

147
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,202
I swore a sacred oath
to free them.

148
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,371
Majora then understood...

149
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,041
for a woman to have
any voice in this world,

150
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,244
it would have to come out
of her husband's stupid mouth.

151
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:27,213
My love, you are so noble

152
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,116
to take on the backbreaking work
of four men,

153
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,217
day in, day out,

154
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,219
no matter how poor and hungry

155
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,488
it shall leave you.

156
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:39,092
Look, fellas, no one honors
oaths more than me.

157
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,593
No one.

158
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,862
Just give me a little time
till we get on our feet,

159
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,531
then I'll totally free you.

160
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,599
Management thanks you
for your patience.

161
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,803
And, so, in choosing
greed over loyalty,

162
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,505
the young couple
began their rise to power...

163
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,675
and their fall from grace.

164
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:59,145
Well, now I feel stupid
getting them a wedding gift.

165
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:07,958
Obeseus entered
the second act of his life

166
00:08:07,982 --> 00:08:11,045
running the dirty,
bloody business

167
00:08:11,046 --> 00:08:12,614
given to him
by his father‐in‐law.

168
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:14,783
A laundromat.

169
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:19,951
Fun fact, in Ancient Rome,
clothes were washed

170
00:08:20,017 --> 00:08:23,854
with ammonia, which
is derived from human urine.

171
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:24,921
What's up, Dad?

172
00:08:24,956 --> 00:08:26,290
How's the whiz biz?

173
00:08:26,357 --> 00:08:29,727
Mellow and yellow.

174
00:08:29,794 --> 00:08:31,495
Why is the store closed?

175
00:08:31,562 --> 00:08:32,663
It's only noon.

176
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,999
Me and the fellas
are all peed out.

177
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:38,269
How am I supposed to make things
clean without human waste?

178
00:08:38,336 --> 00:08:40,171
This business has been
failing for years

179
00:08:40,237 --> 00:08:42,540
because you've been
phoning it in.

180
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,208
Figure it out.

181
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:47,044
Hey, boss?

182
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:48,346
We came up with an idea that

183
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:50,448
could increase ammonia
production.

184
00:08:50,514 --> 00:08:53,184
All you got to do is put
these jugs outside of taverns,

185
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,319
and you'll get
your urinus gratis.

186
00:08:55,386 --> 00:08:58,622
Crowdsourcing
a streaming service, eh?

187
00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:00,825
I'm a genius!

188
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,097
Stealing the idea
of his indentured friends,

189
00:09:06,163 --> 00:09:08,265
Obeseus was soon flush

190
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:09,700
in liquid assets.

191
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:11,402
And he was able
to move his family

192
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:14,372
to the more prosperous
side of town.

193
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:44,502
Lennus, I'm fatigued.

194
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:46,037
Yawn for me?

195
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:51,742
Obeseus, we gave you
the idea that made you rich.

196
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:54,045
How about making good
on your promise,

197
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:55,579
and freeing us now?

198
00:09:55,646 --> 00:09:57,915
Guys, guys, guys,
thank you so much

199
00:09:57,982 --> 00:09:59,283
for bringing this up.

200
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,685
I'm really lucky
to own friends like you.

201
00:10:01,752 --> 00:10:03,687
Tell you what,
I'll have my accountant

202
00:10:03,754 --> 00:10:05,890
crunch the letters,
and we'll circle back.

203
00:10:05,956 --> 00:10:07,191
The important thing is

204
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:09,660
we started a conversation.

205
00:10:13,798 --> 00:10:16,233
And now let us
thank Lord Jupiter

206
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,037
for a bountiful harvest
by draining the blood

207
00:10:20,104 --> 00:10:23,207
of this baby goat.

208
00:10:24,308 --> 00:10:26,210
Aw, these seats suck.

209
00:10:26,277 --> 00:10:28,245
Can't even see
the entrails from here.

210
00:10:28,312 --> 00:10:31,649
Well, they save all
the best seats for the senators.

211
00:10:35,152 --> 00:10:37,888
What if you became a senator?

212
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:40,257
Think about how much
more respected we'd be.

213
00:10:40,324 --> 00:10:43,260
I don't know.
It sounds like a lot of work.

214
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,862
Sitting there all day,

215
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:47,698
listening, voting on stuff
with my thumb.

216
00:10:47,765 --> 00:10:49,133
But think of the perks.

217
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,869
You'll get invited
to fancier orgies.

218
00:10:51,936 --> 00:10:54,772
- The kinds with women.
- They have those?

219
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,642
And with that, Obeseus
marched down the Appian Way

220
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:00,678
to plead his case
to the emperor,

221
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:04,081
confident that he would be
welcomed into the senate.

222
00:11:04,148 --> 00:11:07,685
The pee guy, a senator?

223
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:10,087
That would be an insult
to the dignity of this office.

224
00:11:10,154 --> 00:11:13,090
Now if you'll excuse me,
Senator Horse and I

225
00:11:13,157 --> 00:11:15,493
are going shopping
for lewd pottery.

226
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,898
Stupid emperor.

227
00:11:20,965 --> 00:11:24,435
Thinks he's great
'cause his bangs are so curly.

228
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,471
Oh, Majora's gonna be so mad.

229
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:30,641
I'd do anything to be a senator.

230
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,976
Anything, eh?

231
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:34,778
You know, as the emperor's
politically adopted son,

232
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:38,349
I am next in line to the throne
should anything happen to...

233
00:11:38,415 --> 00:11:40,184
Daddy.

234
00:11:40,251 --> 00:11:42,953
Like, say, him slipping
and falling back‐first

235
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,255
onto a knife.

236
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:46,624
Oh, that happened to me once.
Sucked.

237
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,493
Kill the emperor
and I'll make you a senator.

238
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,329
Kill the emperor
to become senator?

239
00:11:52,396 --> 00:11:54,331
But what's in it for me?

240
00:11:54,398 --> 00:11:56,267
Jacta alea est.

241
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,402
The die was cast.

242
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:01,639
<i>When in Rome you do
as the Romans do</i>

243
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:05,042
<i>You play as the Romans
play together</i>

244
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:07,044
Hey, get out of here, you.

245
00:12:07,111 --> 00:12:08,812
This is my private vomitorium

246
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,082
and I've got a belly
full of hot figs.

247
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:15,052
Come on, you figs.

248
00:12:18,856 --> 00:12:22,326
Et... tu... pee guy?

249
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,765
History rules!

250
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,467
Poor Majora.

251
00:12:30,534 --> 00:12:32,970
She wanted her husband
to be more ambitious,

252
00:12:33,037 --> 00:12:34,705
but not like this.

253
00:12:34,772 --> 00:12:36,941
Well, actually...

254
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:42,079
Give me a kiss,
you big, stabby go‐getter.

255
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,650
I love my job.

256
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,677
Over the next ten years,

257
00:12:51,678 --> 00:12:53,934
Senator Obeseus' power
grew vastly,

258
00:12:54,602 --> 00:12:56,037
as did his toga size.

259
00:12:56,103 --> 00:12:58,472
And Majora reveled
in the high status,

260
00:12:58,539 --> 00:12:59,941
hosting the town's elite

261
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:02,543
at her lavish Saturnalia party.

262
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,180
I love your holiday decorations.

263
00:13:06,247 --> 00:13:08,783
It lets those pesky Christians
know they aren't going to win

264
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,785
the war on Saturnalia.

265
00:13:10,852 --> 00:13:12,320
So, noble slaves,

266
00:13:12,386 --> 00:13:15,790
what gift do you desire
from your benevolent master?

267
00:13:15,857 --> 00:13:18,226
Our friggin' freedom.

268
00:13:18,713 --> 00:13:21,449
Yeah, well,
the thing about that is...

269
00:13:22,223 --> 00:13:24,192
Why do we even bother
asking anymore?

270
00:13:24,258 --> 00:13:25,793
He's never gonna free us.

271
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,429
This has been
building up for a while.

272
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:30,098
You give slave owners
a bad name.

273
00:13:30,164 --> 00:13:31,666
What?

274
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:34,669
- What a giant jerk.
- He's the worst.

275
00:13:34,736 --> 00:13:37,572
Dad, Bartigula's out of control.

276
00:13:37,638 --> 00:13:40,208
Look what he's doing
to Ptolemaic Book Guy.

277
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:42,844
Why are you flaying yourself?

278
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,046
Why are you flaying yourself?

279
00:13:45,113 --> 00:13:46,914
An interesting paradox.

280
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:50,251
For does free will
truly exist or...

281
00:13:50,318 --> 00:13:51,919
Growing up rich and spoiled

282
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:54,789
has turned your son
into a monster.

283
00:13:54,856 --> 00:13:55,857
It's not my fault.

284
00:13:55,923 --> 00:13:57,692
I never spend any time with him.

285
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:02,297
My son's a maniac.
My daughter's not a son.

286
00:14:02,364 --> 00:14:04,532
My slaves hate me
for some reason.

287
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:06,768
Heavy lies the head

288
00:14:06,835 --> 00:14:10,138
that wears the wig
of curly bangs.

289
00:14:11,306 --> 00:14:13,041
I'm spent.

290
00:14:13,108 --> 00:14:16,745
Just gonna take a bath in warm
donkey milk and go to sleep.

291
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:19,881
I can't believe the emperor
didn't even come to my party.

292
00:14:19,948 --> 00:14:22,751
He wouldn't even be emperor
if not for you.

293
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:24,395
Yeah, well, what do you want me
to do about it...

294
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:26,221
kill the emperor?

295
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:28,923
Well, if that's what you want.

296
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,359
You can even
use the present I got you.

297
00:14:31,426 --> 00:14:33,361
Sweet jumpin' Jupiter!

298
00:14:33,428 --> 00:14:34,663
What more do you want?

299
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:36,064
We started at the bottom

300
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:38,667
and now we're
one rung from the top.

301
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:41,236
It's a natural stopping point.

302
00:14:41,302 --> 00:14:43,405
Will you never be satisfied?

303
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:45,674
Pardon me, Senator.

304
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,177
I'm sorry you find my ambition
so distasteful.

305
00:14:49,244 --> 00:14:50,445
Just remember...

306
00:14:50,512 --> 00:14:53,982
power comes to those
who take it.

307
00:14:57,952 --> 00:15:00,321
Aw, yeah. Yeah.

308
00:15:00,388 --> 00:15:02,323
Milk, milk, milk.

309
00:15:05,193 --> 00:15:06,661
To the Roman Empire.

310
00:15:06,728 --> 00:15:10,265
May it last forever,
in some strange form or another.

311
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:13,935
Can't be too careful these days.

312
00:15:14,002 --> 00:15:15,470
Oh, taster.

313
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:19,774
Poison.

314
00:15:19,841 --> 00:15:21,776
Some has tried to kill me.

315
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:23,511
You didn't?

316
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:25,213
You wouldn't.

317
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,249
When I find whoever did this,
I will crush them like a...

318
00:15:34,489 --> 00:15:37,525
The emperor is dead!

319
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:40,161
Who will nominate his successor?

320
00:15:40,228 --> 00:15:43,264
Friends, Romans, countrymen.

321
00:15:43,331 --> 00:15:44,899
That's me.

322
00:15:44,966 --> 00:15:46,568
We deserve an emperor who can

323
00:15:46,634 --> 00:15:49,137
boldly lead us into the future.

324
00:15:49,204 --> 00:15:51,272
My son, Bartigula.

325
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:52,941
Wha?!

326
00:15:54,342 --> 00:15:55,543
He was born rich,

327
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,179
so he got to be good
at business.

328
00:15:58,246 --> 00:16:00,148
Bartigula!

329
00:16:00,215 --> 00:16:03,785
Bartigula! Bartigula!

330
00:16:03,852 --> 00:16:06,554
Bartigula!

331
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:10,024
And so began the reign
of Bartigula the Jerk.

332
00:16:10,091 --> 00:16:12,894
Eager to expand the empire,
he declared war

333
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:15,897
on Neptune, God of the sea.

334
00:16:15,964 --> 00:16:18,099
Despite some early victories,

335
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:21,069
thousands drowned.

336
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:24,139
Bartigula blamed
the troubles of Rome

337
00:16:24,205 --> 00:16:26,741
on foreign invaders.

338
00:16:26,808 --> 00:16:30,545
So he built a large and
expensive wall to keep them out.

339
00:16:30,612 --> 00:16:32,113
Awk, who needs ya?

340
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,948
Ya Carthage‐sacking

341
00:16:34,015 --> 00:16:36,017
aqueduct guzzlers.

342
00:16:36,084 --> 00:16:38,553
And finally,
to silence his critics,

343
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,157
Bartigula dissolved the senate.

344
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:47,562
The young emperor
had gone mad with power.

345
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:49,364
And syphilis.

346
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,965
Listen up, Rome‐wads.

347
00:16:51,032 --> 00:16:52,066
The empire's in crisis,

348
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:53,968
the economy's
in the crapatorium,

349
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:56,171
and Neptune's
kicking our butts, somehow.

350
00:16:56,237 --> 00:16:58,173
I now realize...

351
00:16:58,239 --> 00:17:01,409
I can no longer be your emperor.

352
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,213
Because I am now your god!

353
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:08,783
That's it.
I'm taking a stand.

354
00:17:10,151 --> 00:17:12,353
My son isn't a god.

355
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,656
He's just
an entitled little psycho.

356
00:17:14,722 --> 00:17:17,125
Society must come to its senses

357
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:19,360
and overthrow this madman!

358
00:17:19,427 --> 00:17:21,729
I don't know.

359
00:17:21,796 --> 00:17:24,132
Blasphemy! Seize him!

360
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:27,468
For your heresy, Father,
I sentence you

361
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:29,938
to be eaten by the lions.

362
00:17:31,072 --> 00:17:33,942
We're gonna need more lions.

363
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:35,743
Why are we here?

364
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,946
They said I could bring
a couple of belongings.

365
00:17:38,012 --> 00:17:41,182
Hey, this is where we made
our freedom pact, remember?

366
00:17:41,249 --> 00:17:44,519
The one you refused to honor
for 20 years.

367
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:46,654
Not freeing you guys

368
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:49,090
was the first worst thing
I ever did,

369
00:17:49,157 --> 00:17:52,527
but I hereby decree you
to be emancipated.

370
00:17:52,594 --> 00:17:55,029
Now face the dawn as free men.

371
00:17:55,096 --> 00:17:58,399
We're in a jail cell, you dope.

372
00:18:00,268 --> 00:18:02,770
Father, we have
to get you out of the city.

373
00:18:02,837 --> 00:18:04,639
Hurry, and you can still escape.

374
00:18:04,706 --> 00:18:06,374
No, I'm not going to run.

375
00:18:06,441 --> 00:18:08,176
Because you physically can't?

376
00:18:08,243 --> 00:18:09,878
Yes, mostly, but also

377
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:13,481
because we have to stop
Bartigula and save the republic.

378
00:18:13,548 --> 00:18:16,084
Are you fellas with me?

379
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,052
No.

380
00:18:22,924 --> 00:18:24,792
Though he had lost everything,

381
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:28,930
Obeseus still had the heart
of a warrior.

382
00:18:34,002 --> 00:18:36,137
Looks like Hannibal's
missing an elephant.

383
00:18:36,204 --> 00:18:37,505
Oh, yeah.

384
00:18:37,572 --> 00:18:41,109
All hail the living god.

385
00:18:41,175 --> 00:18:42,977
We who are about to die

386
00:18:43,044 --> 00:18:45,246
salute you.

387
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,653
You dare show me
your moon flaps?

388
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:55,390
I will teach this old fool
who is the true gluteus maximus.

389
00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:57,892
Bartigula, no!

390
00:18:57,959 --> 00:19:00,161
There, in front of all Rome,

391
00:19:00,228 --> 00:19:03,865
father and son
engaged in bloody battle.

392
00:19:06,668 --> 00:19:08,369
Bartigula was fast,

393
00:19:08,436 --> 00:19:10,972
but Obeseus was fatter.

394
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:19,514
Kill the god! Kill the god!

395
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,917
Obe, please spare our boy.

396
00:19:22,984 --> 00:19:24,485
What?

397
00:19:24,552 --> 00:19:27,989
Sic semper this, you fat load.

398
00:19:29,023 --> 00:19:30,959
Why, you littleus...

399
00:19:35,797 --> 00:19:37,799
No!

400
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:40,034
My life is over.

401
00:19:40,101 --> 00:19:44,105
I failed Rome,
was a less‐than‐perfect father.

402
00:19:44,172 --> 00:19:45,640
Worst of all,

403
00:19:45,707 --> 00:19:48,643
I really
screwed over my friends.

404
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,812
May the... gods...

405
00:19:50,878 --> 00:19:52,714
forgive me.

406
00:19:55,183 --> 00:19:57,218
I poisoned everything I loved

407
00:19:57,285 --> 00:19:59,220
with my boundless ambition.

408
00:19:59,287 --> 00:20:02,023
My family is no more.

409
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,494
Mom, what about me?

410
00:20:06,561 --> 00:20:09,530
We never really... clicked.

411
00:20:09,597 --> 00:20:12,567
With that, the match was lit

412
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:15,236
that would burn Rome
to the ground...

413
00:20:15,303 --> 00:20:17,238
400 years later.

414
00:20:20,508 --> 00:20:23,411
Who knew
history could be so sad?

415
00:20:23,478 --> 00:20:25,713
The moral
of that story is clear.

416
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,349
Marge is wrong
and ambition is terrible.

417
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:31,819
No, no, no. The lesson
is that the unchecked lust

418
00:20:31,886 --> 00:20:33,321
for money and power can bring

419
00:20:33,388 --> 00:20:35,923
a once‐great nation to ruin.

420
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,693
Does anyone think it was weird
that Dad killed me?

421
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,862
Don't blame me.
Blame your mother.

422
00:20:40,928 --> 00:20:43,698
I just wanted you to go to
one lousy training seminar.

423
00:20:43,765 --> 00:20:45,933
Did you not even listen
to the old guy's story about...

424
00:20:48,202 --> 00:20:50,605
When will humanity ever learn...

425
00:20:50,671 --> 00:20:54,542
to stop letting stupid people
into museums?

426
00:21:00,296 --> 00:21:02,062
They're missing
the whole point.

427
00:21:02,063 --> 00:21:04,700
If Rome had kept worshipping us,
everything would have been fine.

428
00:21:05,116 --> 00:21:06,717
Get over it, Dad.

429
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:09,987
You always get so worked up
whenever you watch the mortals.

430
00:21:10,054 --> 00:21:11,388
Can we change the channel?

431
00:21:11,455 --> 00:21:12,990
This show sucks now.

432
00:21:13,057 --> 00:21:16,494
Yeah, it's totally gone
off the rails since season 2016.

433
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,763
I know, but I want
to see how it ends.

434
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:21,132
Definitely feels
like they're wrapping it up.

435
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:23,501
Any day now.

436
00:21:31,142 --> 00:21:33,911
<i>When in Rome
you do like the Romans do</i>

437
00:21:33,978 --> 00:21:37,548
<i>You play like
the Romans play together</i>

438
00:21:37,615 --> 00:21:40,084
<i>You're all invited,
so right this way</i>

439
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:43,821
<i>You're gonna
meet the Roman holidays</i>
