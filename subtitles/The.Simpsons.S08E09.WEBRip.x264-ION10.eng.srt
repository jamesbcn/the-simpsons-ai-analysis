00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,090
(waa-waa trumpet sound)

180
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,046
(distorted belch)

181
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,428
(screams)

182
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,100
Mister, do you
need some help?

183
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,725
Let him go, Ralph.

184
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:41,851
He knows what he's doing.

185
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,608
(wailing)

186
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,034
(panting)

187
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,245
What's happening to me?

188
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,828
Okay, retrace your steps.

189
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,673
Woke up,
fought with Marge,

190
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,419
ate Guatemalan
insanity peppers.

191
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:08,052
Then I-- Ohh.

192
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,220
Where am I? Shelbyville?

193
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,679
(screams)

194
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,258
Man, this is crazy.

195
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,806
I hope I didn't brain my damage.

196
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,680
I better check my pupils.

197
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,613
(hissing)

198
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,073
Oh... kay.

199
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:37,196
I think I'm gonna be
leaving now.

200
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,125
Huh?

201
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,626
Sunrise, sunset...

202
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,795
Sunrise, sunset...

203
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,303
Sunrise, sunset,
sunrise, sunset,

204
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,926
sunrise, sunset, sunrise...

205
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,393
(screams)

206
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:02,352
Note to self:
Stop doing anything.

207
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,613
Has anyone seen Homer?

208
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,189
Marge, better
you hear it from me

209
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,944
than some gossipy neighbor.

210
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,936
Homer made a total
jackass of himself.

211
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,778
Oh, Helen, that's enough.
Call off your dogs.

212
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,744
But someone had
to tell her.

213
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,124
And I got here first.

214
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,700
-Helen, zip it.
-Oh please. Tim.

215
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,956
Zip it. Ziparoo.

216
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,249
No beer, huh?

217
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,962
(grumbling)

218
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,842
I guess I know what a promise
from Homer J. Simpson is worth.

219
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,643
Hey, buddy, get back there
with the other rocks.

220
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,102
Huh?

221
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,812
A tortoise?

222
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,192
"Follow... the..."

223
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,359
(gasps)
This must be why I'm here!

224
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,398
Follow the what?
Follow the what?

225
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,402
Hurry up!

226
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,987
Get moving you stupid--

227
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,872
When I'm kicking you,
that means hurry up.

228
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,950
Come on.

229
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,052
Oh, you want me
to climb that, huh?

230
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,144
No problemo.

231
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,100
(rumbling)

232
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,729
Oh!

233
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,809
This is 'cause I kicked you,
isn't it?

234
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,515
(grunting)

235
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,975
Lis, check it out.

236
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,322
I saw it, Bart.

237
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,864
You're just mad

238
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:38,907
'cause there's
no clock in your hat.

239
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,489
What hat?

240
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,294
Ah, this baby's wasted
on an idiot like you.

241
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,909
Where's Homer?

242
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,365
Your father decided
that he'd rather come home

243
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,375
in a taxi... or a police car.

244
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,338
(grunting)

245
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,339
(gasping)

246
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,303
Marge, thank God
you're here.

247
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,473
Where's the car?

248
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,971
Marge? Marge?

249
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,644
Oh, now what?

250
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,143
If you're still mad at me,
I'm gonna be really mad.

251
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,636
Come on, Marge,
will you..?

252
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,478
Fight fair.
I never do this to you.

253
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,114
Talk to me!

254
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,070
(wind blowing)

255
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,831
Oh, I hate this place.

256
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,749
Why am I here?

257
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,208
VOICE: <i>You are on</i>
<i>a quest for knowledge.</i>

258
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,169
Who said that?

259
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,469
Fear not, Homer.

260
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,141
I am your spirit guide.

261
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,299
Hiya.

262
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,307
There is a lesson
you must learn.

263
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,729
If it's about laying off
the insanity peppers

264
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:48,768
I'm way ahead of you.

265
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,021
No, I speak of a deeper wisdom.

266
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,023
The problem, Homer,

267
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,355
is that the mind is
always chattering away

268
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,651
with a thousand thoughts
at once.

269
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,855
Yeah, that's me all right.

270
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,815
(wind blowing)

271
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,164
Clarity is the path
to inner peace.

272
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,453
Well, what should I do?
Should I meditate?

273
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,747
Should I get rid
of all my possessions?

274
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,131
Are you kidding?!
(chuckles)

275
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,499
If anything, you should
get more possessions.

276
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,296
You don't even have
a computer.

277
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,929
You know, I have been meaning
to take a spiritual journey

278
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,298
and I--

279
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,724
(growling)

280
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,683
Hey, knock it off!

281
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,603
Sorry.

282
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,351
I am a coyote.

283
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,023
Look, just give me
some inner peace

284
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,521
or I'll mop the floor
with you.

285
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,563
Good. Your mind is in
a state of readiness.

286
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,318
So listen well.

287
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,819
To make yourself complete,

288
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,492
you must find your soul mate.

289
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,990
Soul mate?

290
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,242
Your kindred spirit.

291
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,704
The one with whom you share
an unspoken bond,

292
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,495
a profound mystical
understanding.

293
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,409
That's it?

294
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,328
Well, that's Marge.
Big deal.

295
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,166
Great spiritual quest,
Wolfie.

296
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,513
My soul mate is Marge.

297
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,258
Is it?

298
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,808
Hey wait. Come back.

299
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,060
Oh.

300
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,851
(horn blowing)

301
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,265
Oh! A ghost train!

302
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,403
And so little time
to get out of the way.

303
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,440
Now less...

304
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,113
Now none!
(screams)

305
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,441
D'oh!

306
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,662
Hey, get off the course,
you bum!

307
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,158
Security.

308
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,530
(whistle blowing)

309
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,116
Wha-- Golf course?

310
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,752
Did I dream that whole thing?

311
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,830
Maybe the desert
was just a sand trap.

312
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,286
Oh, and I bet

313
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,956
that crazy pyramid
was just the Pro Shop.

314
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,166
And that talking coyote
was really just a talking dog.

315
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,628
Hi, Homer.
Find your soul mate.

316
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,138
Hey, wait a minute.

317
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,429
There's no such thing
as a talking dog.

318
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,853
(barking)

319
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,271
Damn straight.

320
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,059
So then I says to Mabel,
I says--

321
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,233
Hi, kids.

322
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,481
I'll finish this later.
Hi Dad.

323
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,732
-Where is your mother?
-Out back.

324
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,904
So anyway,
I says to Mabel, I says--

325
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,033
Hi, honey.

326
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,951
(singsongy)
Oh, I guess you're cranky

327
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,451
because I didn't
come home last night.

328
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,453
I'm "cranky" because
my husband got drunk

329
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,406
and humiliated me
in front of the entire town.

330
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,327
You broke
your promise, Homer.

331
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,417
Oh, honey,
I didn't get drunk.

332
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,052
I just went to a strange
fantasy world.

333
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,970
Come on, you got
to believe me.

334
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,219
You're my soul mate.

335
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,260
Don't "soul mate" me!

336
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,894
Okay.

337
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,890
(snoring)

338
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:35,682
That coyote said my soul mate
would understand me

339
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,148
but Marge doesn't understand me
at all.

340
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,858
Maybe we're not kindred spirits.

341
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,857
We don't have
anything in common.

342
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,493
Look at these records.

343
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,660
Jim Nabors, Glen Campbell,
The Doodletown Pipers.

344
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,530
Now look at her records.

345
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,447
They stink!

346
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:57,035
Oh. Maybe I had
that crazy dream for a reason.

347
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,165
Wherever my soul mate is,
it's not here.

348
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,715
I always just figured
my wife was my soul mate,

349
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,347
but if it's not Marge,
then who is it?

350
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,064
Where do I begin looking?

351
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,734
This really goes
beyond my training

352
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,563
as a furniture
salesman, sir.

353
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,148
Now, if you
don't want the sofa

354
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,613
I'll have to ask you
to leave.

355
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:32,158
Hey, Barney, soul mate,
let me buy you a beer.

356
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,411
Okay, but I'm not
your soul mate.

357
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,333
I'm really more
of a chum.

358
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,292
-What about you, Lenny?
-I'm a crony.

359
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,872
-Carl?
-I'd say acquaintance.

360
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,497
-Colleague.
-Sympathizer.

361
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,543
-Compadre.
-Associate.

362
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,706
Contemporary.

363
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,134
I'm a well-wisher

364
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,882
in that I don't wish you
any specific harm.

365
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,585
(sighs)

366
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,507
Hello? Is this, uh...

367
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,845
G.B.M.?

368
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,890
Uh, yeah.
I read in the personals

369
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,515
you were seeking a soul mate.

370
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,561
Well, I also like
rainy days and movies.

371
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,566
Uh-huh.

372
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:09,778
Uh... no...
I don't like that...

373
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,572
or that.

374
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:12,905
No, it's not that I'm afraid.

375
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,030
I'm gonna hang up now.
Bye-bye.

376
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,737
Oh... I give up.

377
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,117
COYOTE:

00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,002
Huh?

393
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,207
What's that blinking light?

394
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,467
(gasps)

395
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,088
The lighthouse keeper.

396
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,345
The loneliest man in the world.

397
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,848
He'll understand me.

398
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,438
(panting)

399
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,613
Earl.

400
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,649
My new friend's name is Earl.

401
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,613
Here I come, buddy!

402
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,323
No more loneliness
for Homer and Earl.

403
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,868
A machine?

404
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,252
Earl's a machine?

405
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,619
Oh, that's just perfect.

406
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:49,247
Homer's desperate search
for a soul mate has yielded

407
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,506
a lighthouse-keeping robot.

408
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,128
Oh, wow.

409
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,510
Hey, look, is that Dad?

410
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,643
Either that or Batman's
really let himself go.

411
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,521
Alone.

412
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,098
Oh, I'm alone.

413
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,313
I'm a lonely,
insignificant speck

414
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,814
on a has-been planet orbited
by a cold, indifferent sun.

415
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,227
(horn blows)

416
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,185
A ship.

417
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,646
A ship with people.

418
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,645
I know.
I'll bring them to me.

419
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,737
And then they'll
have to be my friends.

420
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,695
Come here, people.

421
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,825
(laughing)

422
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,791
Arr, matey.

423
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,294
Nary a warning
light to be seen.

424
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,126
'Tis clear sailing ahead
for our precious cargo.

425
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,762
Uh... would that be
the hot pants, sir?

426
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,510
Aye, the hot pants.

427
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,762
(giggling)

428
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,763
Well, I won't be lonely
for long.

429
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,386
(giggling hysterically)

430
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,731
(footsteps approaching)

431
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,191
Huh? Who's there?

432
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,521
Oh, Homer, thank
goodness you're safe.

433
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,108
-Marge?
-I woke up,

434
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,323
and you weren't there,
and I was so worried.

435
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,913
Really? You were?

436
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,278
But how did you find me?

437
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,905
Well... I was sure
you'd be on foot

438
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,243
because you always say

439
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,748
public transportation
is for losers,

440
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,670
and I was sure you'd head west

441
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,629
because Springfield
slopes down that way,

442
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,550
and then I saw the lighthouse,

443
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,839
and I remembered
how you love blinking lights--

444
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,934
like the one on
the waffle iron.

445
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,139
Or that little guy on
the "don't walk" sign.

446
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,761
-Yeah.
-Wow, Marge,

447
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,597
you really
do understand me.

448
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,772
See, I thought we weren't
soul mates because--

449
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,021
We had a fight?

450
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,852
Right, and we don't like
the same things.

451
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,068
-It's like you're from Venus--
-And you're from Mars.

452
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,858
Oh sure, give me the one
with all the monsters.

453
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,863
Homer, don't you see?

454
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,485
Our differences are
only skin deep.

455
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:44,122
But our sames go
right down to the bone.

456
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,491
Maybe we do have--

457
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,327
A profound mystical
understanding?

458
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,503
Hey. We do!

459
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,962
Oh, Marge!

460
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,713
We're number one!
We're number one!

461
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,006
In your face, space coyote.

462
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,300
Space coyote?

463
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,053
-(horn blowing)
-Oh, my God!

464
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,604
-The ship!
-We'll all be killed!

465
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,849
The light.

466
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,140
We got to get
the light back on.

467
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,067
Jonathan Livingston
Seagull!

468
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,569
We're on
a collision course!

469
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,741
Hard a-starboard!

470
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,819
Uh, port?

471
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,703
Aye, port.

472
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,780
They see us.

473
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,235
They're starting
to turn.

474
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,906
We did it.

475
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,825
We sure did...

476
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,793
soul mate.

477
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,713
