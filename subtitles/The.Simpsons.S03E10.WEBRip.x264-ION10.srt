{\an8}SMITHERS: It's
a breakthrough product, sir,

15
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,923
{\an8}scientifically formulated
to rinse clean with

16
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,002
{\an8}no oily deposits.

17
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,377
{\an8}Hot dog.

18
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,303
{\an8}And it's mild enough
to use every day.

19
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,511
{\an8}Isn't life grand?

20
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,008
{\an8}What's wrong, sir?
Did I get some in your eyes?

21
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,307
{\an8}The shampoo specifically said,
"no more tears."

22
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,849
{\an8}A lovely promise

23
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,853
{\an8}but one beyond the powers
of a mere shampoo.

24
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,266
{\an8}sir, I feel there's something
you're not telling me.

{\an8}Snappy, you know it's hard
to imagine

30
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:56,283
{\an8}but I was once a barefoot boy
with cheek of tan.

31
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,486
{\an8}I dreamed
of grand slam home runs

32

{\an8}and wiping out nations
with the stroke of a pen.

33

{\an8}Controlled nuclear fission is

36
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,835
{\an8}So you feel resentful
towards the plant?

37
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,590
{\an8}Yes! Yes, exactly!

00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,908
I know people think because
he's rich and powerful and cruel

51
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,492
he doesn't have feelings
like other men, but he does.

52
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,198
And you know what?

53
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,618
I bet he wouldn't sell
the plant for $100 million.

54
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,327

00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,103

68
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,191

69
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,985
Wait a minute,
let's not do that yet.

70
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,068

to make a little small talk

-Ever go dancing?
-Not anymore.

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,700
-We should get together sometime.
-That'd be great.

trust each other.

<i>Ja,</i> but thank you, anyway.

127

Hey, you guys aren't

<i>Nein.</i>
We are from Germany.

would ever sell it?

135

00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,987
We'll still have enough left
to buy the Cleveland Browns.

140

What are we gonna
spend it on?

142
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:13,035
Homer's probably buying some
magic beans with it right now.

143
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,002
We'll have
a savings account.

144
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,793
We've never had one.

145
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:21,456

going to be okay from now on.

00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,514

00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,642
You heard?

149
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,888
We heard.
Isn't it wonderful?

150
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,560
We have some great plans
for that money.

151
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,940
Well, I'm afraid I had
some great plans too.

152
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:34,938
What do you mean?

153
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,399
I spent it on beer.

154
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,729
Surprise, surprise.

155
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,855

156
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,284
$5,200?

157
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,532
What are you talking about?

158
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:47,704
What?

159
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,994
(screams)

160
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,367

161
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,705
-(grunts)
-Oww!

162
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,171
Come on, everybody.
It makes you feel better.

163
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,842
Hey, Homer.

164
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,175
Did you buy this car
with your stock money?

165
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,721
Sure did, and
the great thing about it

166
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,095
is everybody got rich.

167
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,891

00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,795
Any comments?

179
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,342
You'll see the Statue of Liberty
wearing lederhosen

180
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,086
before you see Germans
running my plant!

181
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,468
Well then, sir,
why are you meeting with them?

182
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:56,265
So I can look Uncle Fritz
square in the monocle

183
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,440
and say, "nein!"

00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,943

187
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,252
Hmm...

188
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,330
Whoo-hoo!

00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,834
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,126

192
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,500

I think that you'll find
these two gentlemen

00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,891

American as apple pie.

197
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,274

00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,491

205
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,322
He looks great.

206
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,537

how to unjam the rod

00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,497
Well, they can't fire me.
I'm the only one certified

The new owners have elected
me to speak with you

217
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,061
because I am
the most nonthreatening.

218
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,191
Perhaps I remind you of
the lovable Sergeant Schultz

219
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,399
on "Hogan's Heroes."

220
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,568
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah, he does.

221
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,818
What is the best way
to an efficient plant?

222
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,651
-I don't know.
-Well, uh...

223
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,276

00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,123
Happy workers who feel secure
at their jobs--

225
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,159
So let's get to know
each other better.

226
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,163
Do we have any
alcoholics among us?

227
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,285
-Uh... me.
-Right here.

228
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,292
I'm drunk right now.

229
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,214

a six-week treatment

00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,673
at our drying-out facility
in Hawaii,

231
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,213
after which
you'll return at full pay.

232
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,838
-Oh, great!
-Great.

233
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,224
Hey, maybe I'll marry
Elizabeth Taylor.

234
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,262
Lucky drunks.

235
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,894
Also, we cannot uber-emphasize

236
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,561
the importance
of employee safety.

237
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,481
We plan to have
some frank discussions

238
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,271
with your safety inspector.

239
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,324
Yeah, sock it
to 'em, Horst!

240
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,518
Psst. Hey, Homer.

241
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,148
Aren't you
the safety inspector?

242
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,534
D'oh!

Mm-hmm...

00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,240

251
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,472
I wanted to give you something
to remember me by,

252
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,009
and I know you've always had
your eye on this photo

253
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,473

254
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,223
He was so good
to his mother, sir.

255
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,465
Yes, but I couldn't understand
a word that man said.

256
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,887

Oh, sir, what will
you do next?

260
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,318
First, I'll get that new hip
I've been hankering for.

261
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,454
Then, who knows?

262
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,120
Beekeeping, boxing,

263
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,329
bocce ball...

264
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,328
The world is my oyster,
Smithers.

265
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,501
Farewell.

266
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,298
Lisa, your father
needs your help.

267
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,260
Do you know anything
about Germany?

268
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,880
Well, it's a country
in Europe.

269
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,336
Good, good. I'm learning.

270
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,136
One of the economic powers
of the world.

271
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,140
Because we send them money?

272
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,181
(laughing)
No.

273
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,175
Because they're efficient
and punctual,

274
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,187
with a strong work ethic.

275
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,189
D'oh!

276
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,560
Oh, woe is me.

277
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,227
Homie, come to bed.

278
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,066
Oh, Marge, I'm gonna be
fired, I know it.

279
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,861
Don't worry.

280
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,365
Whatever happens,
we'll pay the bills somehow.

281
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,988
Marge, it's not the money.

282
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,485
My job is my identity.

283
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,497
If I'm not
a safety whatchama-jigger,

284
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,539
I'm nothing.

285
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,752
Well, if you can't sleep,

286
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,793
why don't you do
something constructive?

287
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,257
Ooh... Battlestar Galactica!

288
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,138

289
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,179

291
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,104

00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,437
Yo, Homer, you got
to get ready for work.

294
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,694
Uh-huh. What?

295
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,315
What am I gonna--

296
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,577

Hey, you!

297
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,828
Stop being... so unsafe!

298
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,950
Smitty... safen up.

299
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:27,997
Homer, could we have
a word with you?

300
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,250
No.

301
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,751
I must have phrased
that badly.

302
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,093
My English is--
How you say? Inelegant.

303
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,259
I meant to say may we have
a brief, friendly chat?

304
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,088
-No.
-Once again, I have failed.

305
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,804
"We request
the pleasure of your company

306
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,385
for a free exchange of ideas."

307
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,850
No!

308
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,219
You've been safety inspector
for two years.

309
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,727
What initiatives have you
spearheaded in that time?

310
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,519
Uh... all of them?

311
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:52,897
I see.

312
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,900
Then you must have
some good ideas

313
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,442
for the future as well.

314
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,985
I sure do!

315
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,448
Such as?

316
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,703
Well, uh...
I wish the candy machine

317
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,077
wasn't so picky about taking
beat-up dollar bills...

318
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,875
because...

319
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,628
a lot of workers
really like candy.

320
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,671
We understand, Homer.

321
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,255
After all, we are from
the land of chocolate.

351
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,110

00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,374
I just read them
and left them in the store.

356
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,044
(groans)
You shouldn't do that.

357
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,042
My jump rope broke but
I just tied it back together.

358
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,384
That's good, Lisa.

359
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,629
I didn't take
a bath today

360
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,090
and I may not take
one tomorrow.

361
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,590
I want you to take baths,
Bart.

362
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,592
Lousy German know-it-alls.

363
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,345
Who are they
to say I'm not safe?

364
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,888
Oh, what's the matter
with this thing?

365
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,388
No problems here.

366
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,894
That's right,
Burnsie.

367
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,057
Keep your wrist
supple.

368
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,355
Throw it,
don't aim it.

369
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,360
(grunting)

370
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,902
(laughing)

371
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,315
This is my park.

372
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,493
Get out!

373
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,699
It was worth it.

374
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,373
This place has really gone
to hell, Mr. Burns.

375
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,081
It's obscene what they did
to your office.

376
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,412
Listen Smithers,
you caught me at a bad time

377
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,038
but my folk guitar class
has been canceled for tonight.

378
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,245
Would you like to get
together for a drink?

379
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,296
Would I?!

380
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,709
I got to go.
See you at 6:00.

381
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,508
(bell dings)

382
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,723
You're going down,
my friend.

383
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,894
Yes, sir, Mr. Burns.

384
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,268
That shouldn't be.

385
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,188
<i>Ach du lieber!</i>
<i>Raccoons!</i>

386
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,309
That's right.

387
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,687
Gather the nectar,
my little drones

388
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,324
and make the honey--

389
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,321
honey for your children.

390
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,493
Fools!

391
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,570
(maniacal laughter)

392
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,565
Ready for
that drink, sir?

393
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,657
Just a second, Smithers.

394
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,451
Let me introduce you
to the gang.

395
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,075
That's Buzz, that's Honey,

396
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,201
and you see
that queen over there?

397
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,907
Her name is Smithers.

398
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,248
That's very flattering,
sir, but we should go.

399
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,173
Several bees
are stinging me.

400
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,252
(phone rings)

401
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,746
Moe's Tavern.
Moe speaking.

402
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,338
Uh, yes, I'm looking for
a Mrs. O'Problem,

403
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,514
first name: Bea.

404
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,141
Uh, just a minute, I'll check.

405
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,258
Uh... Bea O'Problem?

406
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,505
Bea O'Problem?

407
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,556
Come on, guys.

408
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,229
Do I have
a B.O. Problem here?

409
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,268
You sure do.

410
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,651
(laughing)

411
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,649
Oh! It's you, isn't it?

412
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,071
<i>(Bart laughing)</i>

413
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,859
Listen you!
When I get a hold of you

414
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,242
I'm gonna use your head
for a bucket

415
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,198
and paint my house
with your brains.

416
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,279
(laughing)

417
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,993
Bart, I want you
to go down

418
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,533
to Moe's Tavern.

419
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,986
I need you to bring
your father home.

420
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,657
(gulp)

421
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,536
(snoring)

422
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,594
Excuse me.
I'm looking for--

423
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,671
Wait a minute.

424
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,166
I know that voice.

425
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,337
If it isn't
little Bart Simpson!

426
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,547
I haven't seen you in years.

427
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,597
That's right.

428
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,020
That's my pop.

429
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,348
Oh, little Bart,

430
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,023
we hear all about
your monkeyshines.

431
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,732
Bet you get into
all kinds of trouble

432
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,022
he don't even know about.

433
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,265
Am I right? Huh?
Am I right?

434
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,027
Well, I make
some crank phone calls.

435
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,450
Aw, ha-ha, that's great!

436
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,569
Ha-ha-ha!

437
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,565
Hey, would you sing
that old song

438
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,197
you used to sing for me?

439
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,954
Moe, for you, anything.

440
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,826
BURNS:
Look! A blue-collar bar.

441
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,584

He's a pip,
this one is.

453
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,811
Ah, the mirthless laugh
of the damned.

454
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,267
Hold your nose, Smithers.

00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,857

Barkeep,
some cheap domestic beer

for me and my buddy here.

460
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,912
I'm not your buddy,
you greedy, old reptile.

461
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,745
Smithers, who is
this saucy fellow?

462
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,211
Homer Simpson, sir.

00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,420
Sector <i>sieben gruber--</i>
I mean, sector 7-G.

464
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,671
Recently terminated.

465
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,172
That's right.
I lost my job

466
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,884
so that you could have
another $100 million!

467
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,505
Let me ask you something.

468
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,891
Does your money cheer you up
when you're feeling blue?

469
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,509
-Yes.
-Okay. Bad example.

470
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,716
So let me ask you this:

471
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,177
Does your money ever hug you
when you come home at night?

472
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,638
Why, no.

473
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,107
And does it ever say
"I love you"?

474
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,978
No, it doesn't.

475
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,685
(singsongy)
Nobody loves you.

476
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,695
Nobody loves you.
You're old and you're ugly.

477
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,778
-Way to go, Homer!
-Nobody loves you!

478
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,074
Good heavens, Smithers.

479
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,947
They're not afraid
of me anymore.

480
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,163
BART: Hey, Mr. Burns.

481
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,543
Did you get
the letter I sent?

482
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,829
Letter? I don't recall
any letter--

483
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,792
That's because I
forgot to stamp it!

484
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,173
-Ew!
-(loud laughter)

485
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,631
Ah, that kid slays me.

486
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,672
That was no accident.

if you can't inspire terror
in your fellow man?

494
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,020
I've got to get
my plant back.

495
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,610

a nuclear plant

could be
such a death trap?

499
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,701
It will cost
another 100 million

500
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,785
just to bring it
up to code.

501
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,749
Please sell me my plant back.

502
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,924
I'll pay anything.

503
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,502
Isn't this
a happy coincidence!

504
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:17,127
You are desperate to buy,
and we are desperate to sell.

505
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,926
Desperate, eh?

506
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,219
Advantage: Burns.

507
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,764
This is my offer.

508
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,057
I think you'll find
it's most unfair,

509
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,060
but those are the breaks.

510
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,309
But, Mr. Burns, this is
half of what we paid you.

511
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,896
That's my final offer.
Take it or leave it.

512
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,152
All right, Mr. Burns,
you win,

513
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:41,025
but beware-- we Germans
aren't all smiles und sunshine.

514
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,834
(sarcastic)
Ooh, the Germans are mad at me.

515
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,829
I'm so scared.

516
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,120
Ooh, the Germans!
Uh-oh, the Ger--

517
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,714
-Stop it.
-Stop that.

518
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,669
Don't let the Germans
come after me.

519
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,999
Please stop the 'pretending
you are scared' game.

520
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,035
No, they're so
big and strong--

521
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,667
Stop it, Mr. Burns.

522
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,134
Protect me
from the Germans!

523
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,344
Burns! Stop it!

525
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,587
Get out!
This is my office now!

526
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,137
Get out!

00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,300
You too!

528
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,008
This is a place of business

529
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,978
not a pee-wee flop house.
