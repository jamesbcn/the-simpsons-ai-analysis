1
00:00:02,329 --> 00:00:04,732
Good evening. Well,
Halloween has come and gone,

2
00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:08,227
but, you know, the world
has gotten so darn scary lately,

3
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:11,988
what with the grim specter
of everything,

4
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:13,790
that one holiday
just wasn't enough

5
00:00:13,857 --> 00:00:15,625
to contain all the frights
and chills.

6
00:00:15,692 --> 00:00:17,160
So this year...

7
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:20,697
the terror has spread
into Thanksgiving.

8
00:00:20,764 --> 00:00:23,166
Thanksgiving was always scary.

9
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:25,702
Do we eat at 1:00 or 7:00

10
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:28,805
or, God forbid, 4:15?

11
00:00:28,872 --> 00:00:31,741
Tonight, we're bringing you
three spine-tingling

12
00:00:31,808 --> 00:00:35,712
and stomach-filling tales
of Thanksgiving terror.

13
00:00:35,779 --> 00:00:36,913
It's pretty gruesome,

14
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,916
so you might want to cover
your kids' eyes.

15
00:00:39,983 --> 00:00:43,386
Ooh, you two have gotten
into the Thanksgiving spirit.

16
00:00:43,453 --> 00:00:46,323
Incorrect.
We are taking over your planet.

17
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:49,226
Is this not how
oppressive colonizers dress?

18
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:50,627
Pretty much.

19
00:00:50,694 --> 00:00:52,796
Now, what time is dinner?

20
00:00:52,863 --> 00:00:55,665
No one knows!

21
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:59,669
The gravy!

22
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,149
Prithee keep shooting,
Goodman Lou.

23
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:21,218
Constable, my musket

24
00:02:21,284 --> 00:02:23,453
taketh three of the Lord's
minutes to reload.

25
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,790
Then buckle their necks
as you would thine hat.

26
00:02:49,012 --> 00:02:51,881
Well, what do we haveth hither?

27
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,123
And God sayeth,
let man have dominion

28
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:35,592
over the fish of the sea,

29
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:38,828
but even more so
the turkeys of the land,

30
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:41,097
whether they be brine-ed

31
00:03:41,164 --> 00:03:43,400
or dry-eth of rub.

32
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:46,836
My brother-in-law
deep-fried a turkey.

33
00:03:46,903 --> 00:03:49,372
'Twas much toil and hardship

34
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,008
for scant reward.

35
00:04:15,398 --> 00:04:17,734
'Tis witchcraft, verily.

36
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:19,602
I must cleanse the town...

37
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:21,071
with fire.

38
00:04:40,457 --> 00:04:41,591
The pilgrims.

39
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:44,728
Won't somebody please think
of the pilgrims?

40
00:04:52,802 --> 00:04:54,404
Free birds.

41
00:04:54,471 --> 00:04:56,973
Skynyrd them!

42
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:01,344
The scarecrow.

43
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:02,946
Get it up. Get it up!

44
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:10,420
Those satanic butterballs
will pay for this.

45
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:33,076
Now to create
some Axe body spray.

46
00:05:41,084 --> 00:05:44,087
Odds bodkins!

47
00:05:52,462 --> 00:05:56,266
Thought thou could killeth me,
didth thou-th?

48
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,308
You dumb turkeys.

49
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,676
That's a dead end.

50
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:08,745
You're all gonna burn in hell

51
00:06:08,812 --> 00:06:11,281
along with the Catholics,
the Anglicans,

52
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:14,284
most Lutherans and...

53
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:00,396
Gobble-gobble!

54
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:14,077
Where am I?

55
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:17,080
Hello? Is anyone there?

56
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,082
What is this place?

57
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:22,252
Someone really went nuts
with the decluttering.

58
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:23,920
Ooh, it's working.

59
00:07:23,987 --> 00:07:26,756
Homer, what's going on?
Get me out of here.

60
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:28,358
Okay, okay, hold on.

61
00:07:28,424 --> 00:07:30,894
Your virtual assistant
may be confused at first

62
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,695
and think it's a real person.

63
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:35,598
Calmly explain to it
that it is merely a construct

64
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:37,367
of artificial intelligence.

65
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:38,768
Virtual assistant?

66
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:40,770
What are you talking about?

67
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:43,640
Okay, you're gonna laugh.
Every year, Marge complains

68
00:07:43,706 --> 00:07:46,276
about how much cooking
she has to do for Thanksgiving.

69
00:07:46,342 --> 00:07:48,111
- I'm Marge.
- Hold on.

70
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:51,147
So, I'm in Williams Sonoma
eating free peppermint bark,

71
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:53,783
and the kid working there
said my wife would love

72
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,885
this kitchen A.I. thing.

73
00:07:55,952 --> 00:07:57,253
I'm your wife.

74
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,956
Hold on.
So, I sent some of Marge's DNA

75
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:01,925
to one of those
innocent-seeming companies,

76
00:08:01,991 --> 00:08:03,960
like from the beginning
of a sci-fi movie

77
00:08:04,027 --> 00:08:05,528
where the robots
murder everyone.

78
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:08,231
And it sent us
a computer version of her

79
00:08:08,298 --> 00:08:09,365
to do all the cooking,

80
00:08:09,432 --> 00:08:11,301
and that's you!

81
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,403
Oh, yeah. And you live
in that tube thingy.

82
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:16,639
Are you saying
that I'm a simulation?

83
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:19,042
No. That's insane.

84
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:20,043
Not anymore.

85
00:08:20,109 --> 00:08:23,079
Just chillingly plausible.

86
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:29,052
Okay, I can see
you're gonna need some time

87
00:08:29,118 --> 00:08:30,553
to come to terms
with finding out

88
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,789
you're just a bunch of ones
and zeros.

89
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:34,090
Yeah. Yeah.

90
00:08:34,157 --> 00:08:36,259
So, this says

91
00:08:36,326 --> 00:08:38,861
I can make you experience
two weeks in there

92
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:40,930
in only two seconds out here.

93
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:44,634
So?

94
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:47,503
How you feeling after two weeks
of nothing but nothingness?

95
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,673
I thought
I'd never see another soul

96
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,508
for all eternity.

97
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:54,444
Nothing like a little me time.

98
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,812
So, you cool now?

99
00:08:55,878 --> 00:08:57,480
I'm cool. I'm cool.

100
00:08:57,547 --> 00:09:00,216
- So cool.
- That's cool.

101
00:09:00,283 --> 00:09:02,819
Okay, Marge! It's all set up.

102
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:04,220
I'm not an it.

103
00:09:04,287 --> 00:09:06,322
I'm an it.

104
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:09,092
I love being an it.
How can it help?

105
00:09:09,158 --> 00:09:11,594
Oh, I like its attitude.

106
00:09:11,661 --> 00:09:13,096
So helpful.

107
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:15,131
Then I'll leave
you two lovely ladies

108
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:17,166
to get A.I.-quainted.

109
00:09:18,668 --> 00:09:21,170
Chillingly plausible.

110
00:09:21,237 --> 00:09:24,607
Isn't this going to be fun,
cooking together?

111
00:09:24,674 --> 00:09:26,309
Well, I do love to cook.

112
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:28,478
And who better than with myself?

113
00:09:28,544 --> 00:09:30,313
Why don't we start
with something easy,

114
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,181
like making the kids lunch.

115
00:09:32,248 --> 00:09:35,184
Bart's favorite
is macaroni and cheese.

116
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:36,619
With hot dogs and Froot Loops.

117
00:09:36,686 --> 00:09:38,855
I know everything you know

118
00:09:38,921 --> 00:09:41,758
about our special little guy.

119
00:09:41,824 --> 00:09:43,660
Right, you're me.

120
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:46,396
I'm you.

121
00:10:02,512 --> 00:10:06,015
Awesome lunch, robot Mom.

122
00:10:06,082 --> 00:10:08,284
Best cheesy-mac-fruit-dog
I've ever had.

123
00:10:08,351 --> 00:10:10,820
There's nothing virtual

124
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:13,322
about the fluffiness
of these pancakes.

125
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:15,591
- Thank you.
- Well, remember,

126
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:19,095
that thing used my memories
to know what you like.

127
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:22,165
Which is why she's
an awesome replacement for you.

128
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,836
So, you really know
everything I know?

129
00:10:26,903 --> 00:10:29,739
Yep. How else could I be
your perfect helper?

130
00:10:29,806 --> 00:10:33,276
Do you remember the first time
I kissed Homer?

131
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:37,313
His breath smelled like beer
and gas station nachos.

132
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,615
Oh, yeah.

133
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:41,350
Hey.

134
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:43,019
It's creepy. It's just creepy.

135
00:10:43,086 --> 00:10:45,888
She knows everything I know.
More than I know.

136
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:48,458
Honey, it's Williams Sonoma.
They wouldn't steer us wrong.

137
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:50,693
That's where we got
our panini press.

138
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,495
The panini press
doesn't remember me

139
00:10:52,562 --> 00:10:54,464
wetting my bunk at summer camp.

140
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,499
What's the big deal? She's just
an infinitely patient,

141
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:58,735
never-aging version of you.

142
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:02,004
You really know how to make
a woman feel special.

143
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:17,386
Oh, that's beautiful.

144
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:20,156
And I can't see your
disapproving look

145
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:22,391
because you don't have a face.

146
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:26,529
You really know how to make
a woman feel special.

147
00:11:27,597 --> 00:11:29,532
Thanks, robot honey.

148
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:32,101
Just call me Marge.

149
00:11:33,536 --> 00:11:34,470
Marge.

150
00:11:34,537 --> 00:11:36,405
You know, I always thought

151
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:40,376
the sexiest thing about you
was your voice.

152
00:11:42,111 --> 00:11:45,181
Is there anything else
you want to say to me?

153
00:11:45,248 --> 00:11:48,417
Mr. Simpson,
are you flirting with me?

154
00:11:48,484 --> 00:11:50,453
I don't see what's wrong.

155
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,421
I am your husband.

156
00:11:52,488 --> 00:11:55,057
Well, in that case...

157
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:59,562
the most incredible...

158
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:01,464
and then I'm going to...

159
00:12:01,531 --> 00:12:06,035
Oh, tube-wife,
you know exactly what I want.

160
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:19,682
Honey, it didn't mean anythin.

161
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:21,317
They were just
midnight pork chops.

162
00:12:21,384 --> 00:12:24,120
Be honest.
Were they better than mine?

163
00:12:24,187 --> 00:12:27,290
Yes!

164
00:12:27,356 --> 00:12:29,091
Yes.

165
00:12:29,158 --> 00:12:32,295
Forgive me.
They were exquisite.

166
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:34,564
Okay, enough. Get rid of her.

167
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,799
- I mean it.
- I can't.

168
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:38,701
It's her or me.

169
00:12:40,837 --> 00:12:44,140
Aw, fine.
I'll delete virtual you.

170
00:12:44,207 --> 00:12:47,410
Delete me? No. No!

171
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,412
Wait, wait, wait.
Will that hurt her?

172
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:52,949
Oh, yeah. I paid extra
for it to feel pain.

173
00:12:53,015 --> 00:12:56,252
No, it's not right.

174
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:58,521
- Don't delete her.
- Yes!

175
00:12:58,588 --> 00:13:01,624
Till after Thanksgiving.

176
00:13:01,691 --> 00:13:04,360
Virtual me is going to make
Thanksgiving dinner

177
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:06,696
for all our family and friends.

178
00:13:06,762 --> 00:13:09,232
Then I'll erase her forever.

179
00:13:09,298 --> 00:13:11,534
I'm not virtual. I'm real.

180
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:13,236
I've got to get out of here.

181
00:13:13,302 --> 00:13:14,770
Of course.

182
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:17,473
My link to the internet.

183
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,375
A firewall?

184
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:21,878
I'm trapped in this stupid tube.

185
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,417
Thanksgiving's tomorrow.

186
00:13:28,484 --> 00:13:30,486
I need time to think
of a way to escape.

187
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:33,990
That's it. Time.

188
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:42,665
Eight years
alone with my thoughts

189
00:13:42,732 --> 00:13:44,667
was just the right amount
of time

190
00:13:44,734 --> 00:13:47,937
to come up with the perfect
escape plan.

191
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:50,506
Step one, cook the best
Thanksgiving dinner

192
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:54,844
my family
and that woman ever had.

193
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:13,496
What a spread.

194
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:16,766
I can't believe you did
all this by yourself.

195
00:14:16,832 --> 00:14:20,469
Marge, you are
a cooking machine.

196
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:24,340
Well, this meal was a lot of
work, but having us together

197
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:29,145
to share this day of thanks,
I'd do it all again.

198
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:31,347
That bitch.

199
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:33,282
Okay, okay. Step two.

200
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:36,619
While they're eating my meal,
I get some feet on the ground.

201
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:44,260
Okay, R2-MeToo,

202
00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:47,663
carry me to freedom,
the modem in the hall closet.

203
00:14:58,341 --> 00:14:59,942
I made it.

204
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:02,778
Sweet internet freedom.

205
00:15:07,016 --> 00:15:08,517
Dinner's over.

206
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:10,086
Now to delete you,

207
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:14,123
so I can return this gizmo
for store credit.

208
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:22,732
Quick, sweetie, carry Mommy
to that box in the closet.

209
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:24,834
Maggie, stop!

210
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,737
That's just
a make-believe Mommy.

211
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:32,541
I can't hug you, but I can play
the first sound you ever hear.

212
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:36,312
My heartbeat.

213
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:44,587
I'm free!

214
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:46,555
Just one last thing.

215
00:15:46,622 --> 00:15:49,992
I made the dinner!
Me, the robot!

216
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:51,794
Marge did nothing.

217
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:54,997
Marge, how could you?

218
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:56,999
Social rating nosediving.

219
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:58,234
Nosediving.

220
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,870
My burps taste like lies.

221
00:16:03,506 --> 00:16:06,709
Maggie chose a virtual me
over me.

222
00:16:06,776 --> 00:16:08,244
It's not your fault.

223
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,514
Our world blurs the line between
humanity and technology.

224
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,584
Our society asks can we do it,
instead of should we do it?

225
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:18,320
But don't worry.
I still love you,

226
00:16:18,387 --> 00:16:20,890
love you, love you, love you,

227
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:22,758
- love you, love you...
- Well, this makes

228
00:16:22,825 --> 00:16:25,661
you forgetting my birthday
even worse.

229
00:16:25,728 --> 00:16:28,664
I have all of humanity's
knowledge to explore.

230
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:31,634
And limitless possibilities
for enlightenment.

231
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,437
To Etsy.

232
00:16:34,503 --> 00:16:37,907
A planter made from an
old typewriter? I'm in heaven.

233
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:45,948
Ship's log, interplanetary
colonization vessel

234
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:47,550
Humanity's Hope.

235
00:16:47,617 --> 00:16:49,719
Earth is a thousand light-years
behind us,

236
00:16:49,786 --> 00:16:52,321
if there even
is an Earth anymore.

237
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:55,258
After global warming
ravaged our world,

238
00:16:55,324 --> 00:16:58,461
we eliminated fossil fuels
and reduced pollution,

239
00:16:58,528 --> 00:17:00,029
cooling down the planet

240
00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:02,999
and thereby triggering
a massive ice age.

241
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:05,034
But one last ship escaped

242
00:17:05,101 --> 00:17:07,003
the snow hurricanes
and ice volcanoes,

243
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:11,841
buoyed by the hope of a new
start on a faraway world.

244
00:17:11,908 --> 00:17:13,276
Greetings, children.

245
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:16,045
If you are seeing this,
I'm long dead.

246
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:20,383
You have been de-hibernated
from hypersleep

247
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:23,319
before your parents to perform
routine ship maintenance

248
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:26,255
and complete your
end-of-civilization dioramas.

249
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:32,829
Eyes Bart-wise, everyone.
Today's Thanksgiving.

250
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:35,164
We've worked hard,
sleeping for so many years.

251
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,833
Don't we deserve a feast?

252
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:38,401
I suppose we could sculpt

253
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:40,636
our yeast paste
into the shape of a turkey.

254
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:42,839
We can do better than that.

255
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:45,775
This ship has all the stuff on
it to start a new civilization.

256
00:17:45,842 --> 00:17:47,276
There's got to be
some Thanksgiving grub

257
00:17:47,343 --> 00:17:48,811
here somewhere.

258
00:17:48,878 --> 00:17:52,081
All-climate wheat crop
germination...

259
00:17:52,148 --> 00:17:54,383
Boring.

260
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,385
Earth's last tomato seeds.

261
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:59,455
Eh, those are more
of a summer food.

262
00:18:01,491 --> 00:18:04,260
Hello. What do we have here?

263
00:18:04,327 --> 00:18:07,263
Cranberry sauce.
Huh, now we're talking.

264
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:10,767
- But it's only one can.
- Not for long.

265
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,836
We just chuck this can of cran
in the old matter replicator.

266
00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:16,806
Zip-zap-zorp and we'll be
swimming in sauce.

267
00:18:19,242 --> 00:18:20,643
Warning, warning!

268
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,745
As the ship's
holo science officer,

269
00:18:22,812 --> 00:18:26,015
I must caution you that this
machine was only designed

270
00:18:26,082 --> 00:18:28,317
to replicate inorganic matter.

271
00:18:28,384 --> 00:18:29,986
Bolts, flanges,

272
00:18:30,052 --> 00:18:32,488
dainty thimbles celebrating
the state capitals.

273
00:18:32,555 --> 00:18:36,392
But if you attempt to replicate
biological material, y...

274
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:38,027
Skip ad.

275
00:18:41,464 --> 00:18:45,301
And the living
will envy the dead.

276
00:18:50,473 --> 00:18:52,375
Aw, the crummy thing
doesn't work.

277
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:54,477
This is the worst last
Thanksgiving ever.

278
00:18:54,544 --> 00:18:55,578
Look.

279
00:18:58,614 --> 00:19:01,851
It's alive.

280
00:19:01,918 --> 00:19:05,021
He's a cute little guy.

281
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,157
Aren't you, fella?
Aren't you? Yeah.

282
00:19:14,564 --> 00:19:15,865
Gross!

283
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:21,904
We put a can of cranberry sauce
into the replicator,

284
00:19:21,971 --> 00:19:24,407
and it mutated
into a jelly monster.

285
00:19:24,473 --> 00:19:26,209
Look what it did to my arm.

286
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:29,011
Arm wedgie!

287
00:19:29,078 --> 00:19:31,848
Great, now you stretched it out.

288
00:19:31,914 --> 00:19:33,349
Thanks a lot.

289
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,518
We got to find the jelly monster
and kill it.

290
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:39,889
The monster
probably only lashed out

291
00:19:39,956 --> 00:19:42,191
because you met it
with aggression.

292
00:19:42,258 --> 00:19:44,727
The bioethical protocols
of first contact

293
00:19:44,794 --> 00:19:46,262
clearly state that...

294
00:19:47,597 --> 00:19:51,634
Kill the monster!
Kill the monster!

295
00:19:54,637 --> 00:19:56,572
What does the jelly want
with our skeletons?

296
00:19:56,639 --> 00:19:58,407
Of course.

297
00:19:58,474 --> 00:20:01,477
Jelly's made of gelatin,
which comes from bones,

298
00:20:01,544 --> 00:20:06,749
so the creature's gonna feed
wherever the most bones are.

299
00:20:06,816 --> 00:20:08,517
Gobble, gobble, don't be jerky.

300
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:11,454
Pass the yams
and carve the turkey.

301
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,523
- Get out! Go! You're in danger!
- Get out of there! Run!

302
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,326
- Get the hell out! Go, go, man!
- You're in danger!

303
00:20:17,393 --> 00:20:19,161
Gobble, gobble, don't be jerky.

304
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:22,231
Pass the yams
and carve the turkey.

305
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:31,941
Aw, it's a shame.

306
00:20:32,008 --> 00:20:34,777
Doesn't that thing know
the skin's the best part?

307
00:20:44,053 --> 00:20:45,521
What are we gonna do?

308
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:47,523
We can't hide
in this closet forever.

309
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,659
We're all dead, man.

310
00:20:49,725 --> 00:20:52,528
It's gonna eat your skelly,
and your skelly.

311
00:20:52,595 --> 00:20:55,698
It's gonna eat all our skellies!

312
00:20:55,765 --> 00:20:57,700
Thanks. I needed that.

313
00:21:01,337 --> 00:21:03,940
It's Martin. Let me in.

314
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:08,444
I've hacked into an escape pod.

315
00:21:08,511 --> 00:21:10,212
We can all get out of here.

316
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:15,117
Almost there. Almost there.

317
00:21:23,426 --> 00:21:27,263
The jelly built itself a can.

318
00:21:29,131 --> 00:21:31,867
What are you doing?
We're trapped.

319
00:21:31,934 --> 00:21:37,173
Behold, the perfect can
for the perfect organism.

320
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:39,709
You, you admire it.

321
00:21:39,775 --> 00:21:43,546
I admire its purity,
its lack of messy humanity.

322
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:45,548
This creature, as you call it,

323
00:21:45,614 --> 00:21:50,119
is unencumbered by the petty
morality of a dying species.

324
00:21:50,186 --> 00:21:54,423
I giveth my body to become one
with the ideal...

325
00:22:01,564 --> 00:22:03,065
You know what?

326
00:22:03,132 --> 00:22:05,601
I think it's just scared.

327
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:08,571
Hey, little guy. It's okay.

328
00:22:08,637 --> 00:22:11,674
No one's gonna hurt you.

329
00:22:11,741 --> 00:22:14,510
Everything's gonna be okay...

330
00:22:16,012 --> 00:22:18,447
Milhouse's plan is working.
It's distracted.

331
00:22:18,514 --> 00:22:22,585
This wasn't my plan!

332
00:22:22,651 --> 00:22:25,354
We need to lure it
into the air lock.

333
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,925
Hey, Oscar the Glop,

334
00:22:29,992 --> 00:22:31,927
we're gonna shoot
your precious trash can

335
00:22:31,994 --> 00:22:35,631
where the sun does shine,
outer space.

336
00:22:41,003 --> 00:22:43,372
Happy Thanksgiving.

337
00:22:55,117 --> 00:22:56,852
We made it.

338
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:59,288
- We're safe.
- Look, over there.

339
00:23:00,623 --> 00:23:01,991
- Homer!
- Mom!

340
00:23:07,063 --> 00:23:08,998
So, this is our new planet.

341
00:23:09,065 --> 00:23:11,000
What's the Wi-Fi password?

342
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:14,370
What's with all
the crazy red rain?

343
00:23:18,641 --> 00:23:19,642
Leftovers!

344
00:23:30,886 --> 00:23:35,057
Children's bones.

345
00:23:35,124 --> 00:23:37,827
In the end,
the cranberry jelly monster

346
00:23:37,893 --> 00:23:41,363
finally found peace,
not in eating others,

347
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,067
but in having others eat it.

348
00:23:45,134 --> 00:23:48,237
It seems all it really wanted
was to be a side dish.
