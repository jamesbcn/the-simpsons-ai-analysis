(clears throat)

74
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,566
...tell me about yourself.

75
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:03,196

one working kidney. And you?

something.

Oh, Grampa, nothing says

Well, it's not the famous hat.

134
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,978
It's the one he wore
for a week in April, 1796

00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,634
No way, Jose.

176
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,460
ABE:
Okay, we've seen the lions.

177
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,295
Can we go now?

178
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,848
(screaming)

179
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,770
Oh, Bea!

180
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,027
(trumpeting)

181
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,990
(gunshot)

182
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,115
Mr. Simpson, I presume.

183
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,710
Out of my way.
I got a date with an angel.

184
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,790
You don't know
how right you are, Abe.

185
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,285
-What?
-I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this,

186
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,008
but... Bea passed
away last night.

187
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,260
Oh, no.

188
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,802
It was her ticker.

189
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,505
The doc said
her left ventricle burst.

190
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,215
Oh, no, Jasper.

191
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,476
They may say she died
of a burst ventricle,

192
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,980
but I know she died
of a broken heart.

193
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,781
ABE: I can tell she
really cared for me.

194
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,115
She didn't make me
a pallbearer.

195
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,291
(grunting and groaning)

196
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,580
I can't tell you
how sorry I am, Dad.

197
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,585
Is someone talking to me?
I didn't hear anything.

198
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,008
Oh, no,
Dad's lost his hearing!

199
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,968
No, you idiot,
I'm ignoring you!

200
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,139
You made me miss
the last precious moments

201
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,638
of Bea's life.

202
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,260
I'll never speak
to you again!

203
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,807
I have no son!

204
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,652
Oh, Bea.

205
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,525
Oh...

206
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,534
Hmm.

207
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,946
It was a beautiful service,
wasn't it, Mr. Simpson?

208
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,535
Ahh! Who the hell are you?

209
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,580
Lionel Hutts,
Attorney at Law.

210
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,833
I'm the executor
of Beatrice Simmons' estate.

211
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,875
Mr. Simpson,
Bea was a wealthy woman,

212
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,549
{\an8}and, surprise, surprise,
she left everything to you.

213
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,220
-Really?
-There is one catch.

214
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,889
You must spend one night
in a haunted house.

215
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,889
-(gasps)
-Just kidding, just kidding.

216
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,771
Here's a check for $106,000

217
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,520
"To enjoy as you see fit."

218
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,733
Oh, I'm touched.

219
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,982
$106,000?

220
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,775
Ta-ta, Mr. Simpson.

221
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,858
By the way, old-timer,
I do wills.

222
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:56,163
Why don't I just give you
this pen with my phone number on it.

223
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:59,078
It looks just like a cigar.
Isn't that something?

224
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,408
-(telephone rings)
-Hello.

225
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,663
-Hello, Homer?
-Whoo-hoo! It's Dad!

226
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,495
Dad's on the phone,
he's calling me!

227
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,790
Oh, Dad, oh,
I knew you'd forgive me.

228
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,665
<i>I haven't forgiven you.</i>

229
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:15,972
I just inherited $106,000,
and I just had to tell you

230
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,260
that you're not getting
one thin dime!

231
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,724
-Ha-ha!
<i>-D'oh!</i>

232
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,715
-Mr. Simpson?
-Ahh! What is it?

233
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,097
I couldn't help overhearing
about your new-found fortune,

234
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,185
and let me assure you that here
at the Springfield Retirement Castle,

235
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,981
money does make a difference.

236
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:31,975
-Huh?
-(chuckles)

237
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,566
I mean, there are rubdowns,

238
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,701
and then there
are rubdowns.

239
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:40,118
Listen, you bloodsucker,
has it ever occurred to you

240
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,159
that old folks deserve
to be treated like human beings

241
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,294
whether they have money or not?

242
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,961
Yes, but it passes.

243
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,959
Ohh! You lousy son of a--

244
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,632
I'll take it.

245
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,551
Hey, big spender,
why the change of heart?

246
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,130
Bea told me to enjoy
my moolah,

247
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,586
and I'm going to, dagnabit!

248
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,547
Huh.

249
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,677
-(bell jingles)
-Yeah.

250
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,603
Yeah.

251
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,890
So, where to, pappy?

252
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,097
Eh, take me someplace fun.

253
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,266
You're the boss.

254
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,654
Next stop...
Funsville.

255
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,565
(crowd clamoring)

256
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,110
Ayah.

257
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,780
Ayah.

258
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,699
Ayah.

259
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,794
I miss Bea.

260
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:31,995
I miss you too.

261
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,344
(screaming)

262
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,720
Oh, Abraham, calm down.
I'm not here to scare you.

263
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,628
They've got me haunting
a family in Texas.

264
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:43,387
Oh, I'm glad
you're keeping busy.

265
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:48,061
Now listen Abe. I want to know
why my money isn't bringing you happiness?

266
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,522
Oh, Bea, I'm not cut out
for the high life.

267
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,114
Abraham, if you're not
happy with the money,

268
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,110
why don't you spread it around?

269
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,032
Make other people as happy
as you made me.

270
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,951
Oh, thanks, Bea, I will.

271
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,201
And go see your son.
He misses you.

272
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,953
Oh, I miss him, too,
the big, fat Dickens.

273
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,957
Hey, Bea, I've got to ask you.

274
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,750
What was death like?

275
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,094
Not as scary as this!

276
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,050
(all screaming)

277
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,380
(crying)
I miss my Daddy.

278
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,637
Homer, this thing
with your Dad

279
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,969
has had you moping around
the house for days.

280
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,555
I think it's time for you
to talk to someone who understands.

281
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:34,022
<i>Hiya. You've reached</i>
<i>Doctor Marvin Monroe's anxiety line.</i>

282
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,484
-(doorbell chimes)
<i>-If you have a sullen teenager,</i>

283
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,944
<i>press one now.</i>

284
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,154
<i>If you're estranged from</i>
<i>your spouse, press two, now.</i>

285
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,896
<i>If you have trouble</i>
<i>maintaining an...</i>

286
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,447
-Grampa!
-Huh?

287
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,741
-Dad!
-Sonny boy!

288
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,120
Is there room at your table
for a foolish old man?

289
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,285
Well, sure.

290
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,844
Eh, we'll have to move a chair
in from the den, but it's no problem.

291
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,999
-Bart!
-Choose your corn cob.

292
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,168
<i>En garde.</i>

293
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,626
Challenge accepted.

294
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:05,465
-All my precious stacks of gold...
-(belching)

295
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,763
...couldn't buy me the pleasures
of a simple family meal.

296
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,058
Pass the bug juice, Dad.

297
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,730
Wait your turn, you pig.

298
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,269
I have an announcement
to make.

299
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,313
I've decided to give
Bea's money away.

300
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,188
There are people who
really need it.

301
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,935
I'm gonna let them
come to me

302
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,026
and plead their case,
and then I'll decide

303
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,862
who needs it most.

304
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,367
{\an8}Grampa, that's the noblest
thought that's

305
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,528
{\an8}ever been expressed
at this table.

306
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,867
-Give it to us, Grampa.
-Bart! Forgive him, Dad.

307
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,624
He's just a stupid little kid,

308
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,376
who says the first thing
that pops into his head,

309
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,708
but you know, there's wisdom
in his innocence.

310
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,304
-You don't want it.
-Yes, I do.

311
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,919
Too bad,
you ain't gettin' it.

312
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,933
{\an8}Not since this
reporter's marriage

313
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,140
{\an8}to Stephanie
the Weather lady,

314
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,060
{\an8}has this town been so consumed
with rumor and innuendo...

315
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,771
{\an8}all because of this man.

316
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,561
{\an8}Today, one
Abraham "Grampa" Simpson

317
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,265
{\an8}announced that he will
give away over $100,000

318
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,686
to the person or persons
he finds most deserving.

319
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:07,156
Is Grampa Simpson a modern day
saint, a rich nut, or both?

320
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,989
Only time will tell.

321
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,454
<i>This is Kent Brockman,</i>

322
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:13,164
<i>on line for</i>
<i>an old man's money.</i>

323
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,455
Ah, you see, Gramp,
I want to customize the bus.

324
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,960
You know, chop the top

325
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,592
jack it up,
put mag wheels on it,

326
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,708
psychedelic paint job
from hell, man.

327
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:26,006
Jam the kids to school
at 150 miles an hour.

328
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,431
Here's an artist's rendering.

329
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,639
Note the cobra wrapped
around the naked chick.

330
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,561
-Next.
-Duh...

331
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,020
Grampa... I can call you
"Grampa," can't I?

332
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,481
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

333
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,061
Alright. I need that money.
Please. Please!

334
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,857
Wait a minute. Wait.

335
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,651
You're that guy who owns
the nuclear power plant.

336
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:45,895
Well, the ownership is divided.

337
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,736
What the hell do you
think you are doing?

338
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,621
Mr. Simpson, I dread the day

339
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,328
when $100,000
isn't worth groveling for.

340
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,239
Get out of here!

341
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:58,458
You just made yourself
a very powerful enemy, old man.

342
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,500
Here's the deal, Grampa.

343
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:05,174
A guy I think was an explorer
left this in the bar one night.

344
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,755
It may be a map
to ancient treasure,

345
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,880
or directions
to some guy's house,

346
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,548
but to find out,
we'll need money,

347
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,846
we'll need provisions,
and a two-man diving bell.

348
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,771
It's pretty stupid,

349
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,349
-but so far, you're the front-runner.
-Hmm.

350
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,895
It's a special
isolation chamber.

351
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,770
The subject pulls levers
to receive food and warmth.

352
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,777
The floor can become
electrified,

353
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:29,109
and showers of icy water
randomly fall on the subject.

354
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,116
I call it the "Monroe Box."

355
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,408
-Uh-huh. Well, it sounds interesting.
-Uh-huh.

356
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,333
How much will it
cost to build?

357
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,582
Oh, that's the beauty part.
It's already built.

358
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,294
I need the money to buy
a baby to raise in the box

359
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,835
-until the age of 30.
-What are you trying to prove?

360
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,049
My theory is that the subject
will be socially maladjusted

361
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,801
and will harbor
a deep resentment towards me.

362
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,683
Hmm, interesting.

363
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,390
Let's see.
I want a tear gas pen,

364
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,470
-a blow gun with paralyzer darts...
-Oh, no.

365
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,017
-Nunchakus.
-Nunchakus?

366
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,600
-Yeah.
-What the hell are those?

367
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,765
A copy of
"Radioactive Man, #27."

368
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,314
That's the first time
he fights Dr. Crab.

369
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,517
And I wanna buy
that baseball card

370
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,067
where the guy's
flipping the bird.

371
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,611
Oh, yeah,
I've seen that one.

372
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,784
Oh, and a monkey.

373
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,362
What the hell is that?

374
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,068
Why, it's a death ray,
my good man.

375
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,158
Behold.

376
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,912
Hey, feels warm.

377
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,325
Kind of nice.

378
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,293
Well, it is just the prototype.

379
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,383
With proper funding,
I'm confident this little baby

380
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,049
could destroy an area
the size of New York City.

381
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,338
But I want to help people,
not kill them.

382
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:33,052
Oh. Well, to be honest,
the ray only has evil applications.

383
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,965
You know, my wife
will be happy.

384
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,024
She's hated this whole
death ray thing from day one.

385
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:43,398
Oh, Lisa, what makes you think
you deserve all that money?

386
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,609
I don't deserve it, Grampa.
No one here does.

387
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,730
The people who deserve it
are on the streets

388
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,437
and they're in the slums.

389
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,567
They're little children
who need more library books

390
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,445
and families
who can't make ends meet.

391
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,083
Of course,
if you really wanted to,

392
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,290
-you could buy me a pony.
-You're right.

393
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,120
I'll name her Princess
and I'll ride her every day.

394
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,826
No, you're right about
all the poor souls

395
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,707
who need a helping hand.

396
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,214
I need to take a walk
to clear my head.

397
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,127
-(siren wails in distance)
-Oh, dear.

398
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,008
(baby crying in distance)

399
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,728
Ah, I'm exhausted.

400
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:24,941
Oh, poor baby.

401
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,480
Been lifting your wallet?

402
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,323
No! I'll have you know

403
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:32,318
I've decided to give my money
away to truly needy causes.

404
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,612
-Hmm.
-But $100,000 just isn't enough.

405
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,317
I need more.

406
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,447
Well, why don't you go on
the seniors' gambling junket?

407
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,076
I bet you could
double your money or even triple it.

408
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,503
Well, it's tempting.

409
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,751
Plus, they got a 99¢
shrimp cocktail.

410
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,844
You sold me.

411
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,128
-(Otto humming)
-Slow down.

412
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,673
Are you trying
to get us killed?

413
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,466
It's too hot, ya' maniac!
Turn on the air already!

414
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,471
Hey, mellow out,
old dudes,

415
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,723
or I'll jam this baby
into a river, all right?

416
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,847
(humming to Edgar Winter's
"Frankenstein")

417
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,395
Miss, I'm looking
for Abe Simpson.

418
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,398
It's important
I get a hold of him.

419
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,480
I have to tell him
I don't care about his money

420
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,816
and I love him.

421
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,440
We get that a lot.

422
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,697
He left with
the senior casino junket.

423
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,319
Casino?
(screams)

424
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,832
(humming Jethro Tull's
"Aqualung")

425
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,159
Come on, everybody!

426
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:26,714
(humming together)

427
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,339
Hello, I am Plato.

428
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:38,393
Please partake of keno, craps,
and the loosest slots in town.

429
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,678
My philosophy is "enjoy."

430
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,227
Change, please.

431
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,059
(gasps)

432
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,274
(tires screeching)

433
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,565
A double cheeseburger, onion rings,
large strawberry shake,

434
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,149
-and, for God sakes, hurry.
<i>-(distorted voice on speaker)</i>

435
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,945
$5,000 on...

436
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,620
-What century is this?
-The 20th.

437
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,948
Great! Put it on #20.

438
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,663
Excuse me.

439
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,043
Excuse me, have you seen an old man
with a lot of money?

440
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,409
He looks like me,
but he's wrinkled.

441
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,035
Hello. Have you seen a-- Dad!

442
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:11,463
No!

443
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,213
-DEALER: 20 black.
-(Abe laughing)

444
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,125
-Holy moly. You're winning.
-All mine, all mine.

445
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,005
Beat it, boy.
You're cramping my style.

446
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,971
Dad, please, you gotta
quit while you're ahead.

447
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,802
You got to take your money
and leave, now.

448
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,387
Sorry, boy. I have to get
enough to help everybody.

449
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,523
But you could lose everything.
Come on!

450
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,690
Homer, I think Rudyard Kipling
said it best.

451
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:34,611
"If you can make one heap
of all your winnings

452
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:38,571
"and risk it on one turn
of pitch and toss, and lose,

453
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,534
"and start again
at your beginnings

454
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:45,285
"and never breathe a word
about your loss,

455
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:49,999
"yours is the Earth
and everything that's in it.

456
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:55,002
And, which is more,
you'll be a man, my son."

457
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,167
You'll be a bonehead.
Come on.

458
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,296
Put it all on 41.
I've got a feeling about that number.

459
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,844
The wheel only
goes to 36, sir.

460
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,927
Okay, put it all on 36.

461
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,062
I've got a feeling
about that number.

462
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,178
Dad! No!
Give me that money.

463
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,227
Come on. Stop it. Ow!

464
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,650
Ow! You're hurting me!

465
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,148
-Thirty-six!
-No more bets.

466
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,270
Oh!

467
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,816
Son, if this
lands on 36, I'll...

468
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,281
Double zero.

469
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:23,201
Son, you saved me
from losing all my money.

470
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,582
For the first time in my life,
I'm glad I had children.

471
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,710
So, uh, have you figured out
who gets the money?

472
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,170
Yes, Homer, I have.

473
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,062
(laughing)

474
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,100

475
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,437
Come on in.
