{\an8}Let's begin.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,290
{\an8}I'm happy to report

13
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,046
{\an8}that our shares
in Dynaflux Unimatics

14
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,668
{\an8}are up a delicious
seven and three-quarters.

15
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,126
{\an8}This means our investment
club portfolio

16

18
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,268
{\an8}I suggest
we pump our profits

19
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,518
{\an8}into some new
high-risk ventures.

20
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,481
{\an8}Oh! Oh!
How about Oklasoft?

21
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,611
{\an8}It's Oklahoma's fastest-growing
software company.

00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,018
{\an8}Um, cushions?

23
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,776
{\an8}Everybody likes
to sit on cushions.

00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,068
{\an8}Children are
so fat today.

25
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,152
{\an8}Isn't there some way
we could make money off that?

26
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,027
{\an8}There's a franchise fair
this weekend.

27
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,374

{\an8}I never thought of that.

{\an8}I'm not wild about
these high-risk ventures.

31
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,173
They sound
a little risky.

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,040
Oh, Marge.

33
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,086
You are such
a wet blanket.

34
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,589
If we'd listened
to you,

35
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,010
we wouldn't have sponsored
that Mexican wrestler.

36
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,010
Yet she still gets to share
in all the profits.

37
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,433
{\an8}-Mm-hmm.
-Is that fair?

38
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,761
{\an8}I guess I'm just
not comfortable

39
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:38,845
{\an8}with the whole idea
of "investing."

40
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,392
{\an8}Face it.

41
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,515
{\an8}You can't keep up
with the go-go '90s.

42
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,352
{\an8}Well, Marge...

43
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,397
{\an8}You're about as popular
as rug burn. (chuckles)

44
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,441
{\an8}All in favor
of expelling Marge

45
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,025
{\an8}from the Investorettes...

46
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,690
{\an8}ALL: Aye!

47
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,068
{\an8}All right, Helen.

48
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,235
{\an8}If I'm not wanted,
I'll leave.

49
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,994
You'll get your pancakes
in the mail.

50
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,496
MARGE:
And then they gave me back

51
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,328
my $500 investment

52
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,003
and kicked me
out of the club.

53
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,212
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

54
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,961
Back up a bit now.

55
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,173
When are the pancakes
coming in the mail?

56
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,514
Well, maybe it's all
for the best.

57
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,129
What do you need
to make money for anyway?

58
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,256
As long as I have
my earning power,

59
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,303
this family's got nothing
to worry about.

60

Oww!

61
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,059
Oh, call work and tell them
I won't be in tomorrow.

62
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,892
Mom, this is no time
to be conservative.

63
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,517
Let's roll
the dice here.

64
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,943
It would be nice
to beat those women

65
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,651
at their own game.

66
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:32,071
Maybe I should
look into a franchise.

67
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:41,576
<i>Greetings, humans. I am Investo the Robot</i>
<i>from the planet Opportuniac.</i>

68
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:46,121
<i>My superior brain advises you</i>
<i>to enter the franchise fair.</i>

69
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,377
Well, we're trying to,
but you're blocking our way.

70
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,249
<i>Danger! Danger!</i>

71
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,296
<i>Don't forget to pick up</i>
<i>pamphlets.</i>

72
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,920
I'll handle this.

73
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,509

74
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,175

MAN: Well, that's the miracle
of the franchise.

79
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,691
You get all the equipment
and know-how you need,

80
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,903
plus a familiar brand name
people trust.

81
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,694
You'll be on a rocket ride
to the moon.

82
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,647
And while you're there,

83
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,318
would you pick up some
of that nice green moon money

84
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,407
for me-- Royce McCutcheon?

85
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,582
No deal,
McCutcheon.

86
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,870
That moon money
is mine.

87
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,713
Now, folks, I don't want
to alarm you,

88
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:29,038
but scientists say
40% of America's pictures

89
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,745
are hanging crooked.

90
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,835
ALL: No! No!

91
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,881
Yeah, it's true,
and I hear you asking,

92
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,344
"Well, who's going to straighten out
all these artistic abominations?"

93
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,175
Your friends? A neighbor?

94
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,760
Those fat cats in Washington?

95
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,425
(chuckling)

96
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:45,063
Good luck. Hey, you know,
maybe no one will notice.

97
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:48,521
Maybe the problem
will just fix itself.

98
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,363
Now, you're the one
who's being naive.

99
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,938
Okay, fair enough.

100
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,403
But you sound like

101
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,823
you're ready to become
your own boss

102
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,321
in the exciting world
of frame-nudging.

103
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,743
Yes, for a minimal
franchise fee

104
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,202
you'll receive a pair
of straightening gloves,

105
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,293
a canister of wall lubricant,

106
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,039
and a booklet of the most
commonly asked questions

107
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,750
you will hear,

108
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,670
including "Who are you?"
And "What are you doing here?"

109
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,420
Hmm, I don't want
to own my own business.

110
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,133
I don't know why I came here
in the first place.

that disco record sales

00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,657
for the year ending 1976?

125
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,285
If these trends continue...

00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,224

133
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,098

00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,109

thinking about
becoming interested in.

155
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,031
Hmm.

156
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,529
I'm not cut out

00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,821
Ooh, you sound like me.

which was, ironically,
the young me.

160
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,252
I was once like you were,
young lady--

161
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,789

and welcome
to the dynamic world

190
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,470
of mobile pretzel
retailing.

191
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,596
When can I start?
What's my territory?

192
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,023
Eh, territory...

193
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,941
Well, let me tell you:

194
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,599
Wherever a young mother
is ignorant

195
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,898
of what to feed her baby,
you'll be there.

196
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,693
Wherever nacho penetration
is less than total,

197
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,487
you'll be there.

198
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:30,491
Wherever a Bavarian is not
quite full, you will be there.

199
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,525
Don't forget fat people.

200
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,117
They can't stop eating.

201
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,542
Hey! Pretzels!

202
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,390

204

<i>Start by setting up an office</i>

00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,371
<i>Next: Blanket your community</i>
<i>with flyers.</i>

213
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,207
<i>A phony ticker-tape parade</i>

214
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,042

commotion outside?

Why, it's one of those
pretzel wagons

229
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,474
the movie stars are
always talking about.

230
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,930

Here? At our plant?

00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,510

my pretzel.

246
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,547
One pretzel.

247
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,838
Thank you.

00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,443

even need our business.

Just business. Ha!

261

and Gimbels learned

262
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,996
to live side by side.

263
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,920
Gimbels is gone,
Marge, long gone.

264

You're Gimbels.

265
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,841

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,720
Hey, slow down.

269
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,893
I wants to talk to you.

270
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,972
Give us 300 pretzels.

271
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,768
You see? A little persistence
and patience paid off.

272
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,733
That'll be $300.

273
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,273
Hey, I don't think so.

274
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,477
I got me 300 coupons.

(Marge grumbles)

276
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,030
I should have said,
"Limit: One per customer."

277
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,663
Should've, but didn't,
so hand them over.

Mom,

295
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,035
but you got to think big.

296

You can't buy publicity
like that.

I was wrong to have a dream--

325

Wrong as usual.

326
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,674

special, why kid yourself?

Oh, Mom, no.

328

Aim low.

330

Aim so low no one will
even care if you succeed.

331
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,757
Dinner's in the oven.

332

it's under my face.

335
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,330
Ah, it looks likes
Mr. Pretzel-man

336
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,448
is doing pretty well
for himself.

337
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,870
I'm here to see
Mr. Ormand.

338
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,837
Of course.
Right this way.

(organ playing)

340
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,878
Oh, I guess I should speak
to the executor of his estate.

341
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,755
He's right over there.

342
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,302
They were in the same car.

343
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,259
You're my last hope.

344
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,176
I've never reached out

See, boss?

349
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,395
I told you that ad
in the church bulletin

350
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,783
would pay off.

351
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:27,658
(phone ringing)

352
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:31,041
Hello?

353
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,250
No.
Pretzel Wagon's no longer...

354
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,671
300 pretzels?

355
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,500
Wait. Wait.
Let me get this down.

356
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,086
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

357
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,170
Meat Packer's Union Hall,
Batavia, New York.

358
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,388
I'll send them right out.

359
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,388
Homer.

360
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,679
Homie, wake up.

361
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,432
Wake up,
I'm back in business.

362
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,684
I had a feeling things
would work out for you, honey.

363
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,441
Hey, what are you doing?

364
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,691
This is a pretzel town,
pretty boy.

365
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,613
(jazz music plays)

366
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,367
Are you sure the children
will get enough nutrition

367
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,371
from these pretzels?

368
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,372
Yes, I am sure.

369
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,714
Sure as sure can be.

370
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,880
Oh, my God,
what happened to your fingers?

371
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,419
MAN WHISPERING:
Boating accident.

372
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,462
I believe it was
a "boking" accident.

373
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,416
I have to go now.

374
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,548
I don't understand
why they won't unload

375
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,296
our falafel fixings.

376
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,678
Ship's impounded,
ma'am.

377
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,224
Yeah. We found
a couple of barnacles

378
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,387
on the hull.

379
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,805
That and, uh,
the deck was, uh, wet.

380
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,854
That's crazy.

381
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,268
And what are those men
doing under my van?

382
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,267
MAN:
Let's get out of here!

383
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,778
Look, lady, if I was you,

384
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,189
I would just leap
into the air

385
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,197
as I'm preparing to do.

386
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,525
Here you go, Homer.

387
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,946
Thanks, Moe.

388
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,955
Ah, Homer, you know
your money's no good here.

389
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,168
Hey, wait a minute.
This is real money!

390
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,709
Yeah.
My wife is raking it in.

391
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,963
(bell rings)

392
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,085
(whistling)

393
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,720
(clears throat)

394
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,012
Greetings, Homer.

395
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,885
Hey, Fat Tony.

396
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,472
You still with the mafia?

397
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,057
Uh, yes, I am.

398
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,443
Thank you for asking.

399
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,359
Now, Homer,
as you no doubt recall,

400
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,439
you were done
a favor by our--

401
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,824
how shall I say--
mafia crime syndicate.

402
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,112
Oh, yeah.

403
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:15,116
Now the time has come
for you to do us a favor.

404
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,330
You mean the mob
only did me a favor

405
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,331
to get something
in return?

406
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,043
Oh, Fat Tony...

407
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,004
I will say good day
to you, sir.

408
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,295
Okay, I will go.

409
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,802
Hey, wait a minute.

410
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,932
Well, here I am,

411
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:41,515
11905 Dead Weasel Road.

412
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,652
I don't see any apartment
building.

413
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,019
I just...

414
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,395
-(tires squealing)
-(Marge screams)

415
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,283
Hey, what's going on?

416
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:00,115
Is there a button
or a release for these keys?

417
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,664
Oh. Oh, you have
to push in as you turn.

418
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,078
-Ah.
-Yeah, that's it.

419
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,047
-Who are you?
-We are your business partners,

420
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:11,758
and as such, we are entitled
to a percentage of your profits.

421
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,260
Something in the area
of 100%.

422
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,804
What are you talking about?

423
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,387
We suggest you have
a conversation

424
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,892
with your husband.

425
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:23,143
You have 24 hours
to give us our money.

426
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,847
And to show you
we're serious,

427
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,228
you have 12 hours.

428
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,234
-Huh?
-See you at 6 a.m.

429
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,359
Homer, did you
tell the mafia

430
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,907
they could eliminate
my competitors

431
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,240
with savage beatings
and attempted murder?

432
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,536
In those words?

433
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,620
Yes.

434
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,424
It just sickens me.

435
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,419
How could you do this
to someone you love?

436
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,381
How could I not?

437
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,961
I saw you pouring
your heart and soul

438
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,836
into this business
and getting nowhere.

439
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,263
I saw
you desperately trying

440
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,681
to cram one more
salty treat

441
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,969
into America's
already bloated snack hole.

442
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,013
So I did what I could.

443
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,307
I did what any
loving husband would do.

444
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,641
I reached out to some
violent mobsters.

445
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,556
Oh, Homer,
I know you were trying

446
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,146
to shield me from failure

447
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,151
but this is my business,

448
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,283
and the mafia's not getting
one cent of my money.

449
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,781
So what are
we going to do?

450
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,743
We're going to do what
we do every day.

451
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,833
We're going
to make pretzels.

452
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,419
There.
That's the last one.

453
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,132
(pretzel snaps)

454
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,586
(knocking on door)

455
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,546
(both gasp)

456
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,434
I had that dream again.

457
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,437
Oh, thank God,
it's only Grampa.

458
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,320
-(knocking)
-Now what?

459
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:55,488
-(both gasp)
-Sorry we're late.

460
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,399
Could we have
the money now?

461
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,487
The answer is no.

462
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,163
I'm afraid I must insist.

463
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,662
You see, my wife,
she has been most vocal

464
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,535
on the subject
of the pretzel monies.

465
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,922
"Where's the money?

466
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,458
"When are you going
to get the money?

467
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,291
Why aren't you getting
the money now?"

468
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,626
And so on.

469
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,881
So, please... The money.

470
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,553
You heard her.
She said no.

471
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:21,893
Legs, Louie, advance on them.

472
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,850
HELEN LOVEJOY:
There they are.

473
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,516
Well, well,
if it isn't Marge Simpson

474
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,023
and her gangland cronies.

475
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,774
Your goon squads certainly
gave you the edge

476
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,436
in the mobile
snack business.

477
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,944
But I'm afraid we've outdone
you once again.

478
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:40,157
Hiroshi, Yukio.

479
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,659
Perhaps you've heard
of the Yakuza,

480
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,121
the Poison Fists
of the Pacific Rim?

481
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,122
The Japanese mafia.

482
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,624
They'll kill you five times
before you hit the ground.

483
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,418
-All right.
-Go!

484
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,382
(grunting)

485
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,143
Hey!

486
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,345
Take that.
Take this.

487
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,444
Come here,
you little squirt.

488
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,939
Homie, maybe
we should go inside.

489
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,284
But, Marge,
that little guy

490
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,989
hasn't done
anything yet.

491
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,699
Look at him.
He's going to do something

492
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,620
and you know it's going
to be good.

493

Every time I try to help,

498
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,576
I just fail miserably.

499
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,998
Oh, I don't hate you
for failing.

500

I love you for trying.

Oh, it's just
