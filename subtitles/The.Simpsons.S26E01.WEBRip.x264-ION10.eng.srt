{\an8}Oh.

63
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,692
{\an8}If you don't let us watch,
we'll just go to a house

64
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,479
{\an8}where some more
permissive parents will.

65
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,812
{\an8}How permissive?

69
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,494
{\an8}Uh, come on, Milhouse,
don't pretend you're asleep.

70
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,083
{\an8}This is the world we live in.

73
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,964
{\an8}Hey, Krusty, our local deli
just named a sandwich after you.

74
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,249
{\an8}It's called "The Unfunny Comedian."

75
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,253
{\an8}(crowd laughs)

76
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,754
{\an8}You will always be remembered
for your countless appearances

77
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,376
{\an8}on the <i>Krusty the Clown Show</i>

78
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,473
{\an8}and your one appearance on
<i>To Catch A Predator.</i>

00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,968
{\an8}(crowd laughs)

80
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,930
{\an8}Hey, I spent a lifetime
making people happy.

81
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,721
{\an8}Yeah-- plastic surgeons
and divorce lawyers.

82
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,466
{\an8}I was just about to say that.

83
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,937
{\an8}Oh, he took my laugh.

84
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,648
{\an8}Screw it, I'm doing it anyway.

85
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,438
{\an8}Plastic surgeons
and divorce lawyers.

86
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,319
{\an8}(man coughs)

87
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,781
{\an8}What a legend.
Krusty the Clown is to comedy

88
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,411
{\an8}what Martin Luther King
is to comedy.

89
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,659
{\an8}(laughter)

90
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,543
We've seen a lot of
top-flight comics tonight,

91
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,420
but that's over, because it's time
to hear from Krusty the Clown.

92
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,749
Welcome, Krusty.

93
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,384
I grew up watching you.

94
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,750
Oh, uh, sorry.

95
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,457
I threw up watching you.

96
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,047
(laughter, applause)

97
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,382
(grumbles)

98
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,006
Sarah Silverman.

99
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,933
I say this with love,
you disrespectful skank.

100
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,603
You've had more... Oh.

101
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,852
Suddenly,
I don't feel like doing this.

102
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:10,854
(gasps)

103
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,686
{\an8}Sorry, Mini-ha-ha.
Canceling the bit.

104
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,942
{\an8}Tell the others.

105
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,453
I thought this night would be fun
for me and my friends.

106
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,199
I don't even know these people.

107
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,575
And I guess I don't have any friends.

108
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,749
My only comfort is the roast is over

109
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,658
and will only be shown four times a day

110
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,287
for the rest of all time.

111
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,585
-Krusty.
-Yeah?

112
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,759
Is your nose red because
it's embarrassed to be seen with you?

113
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,469
-(laughter)
-Oh, nobody warned me

114
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,219
this roast would treat me the same way

115
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,601
as every roast I've seen
and laughed at.

116
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,309
...and the husband says,
"Who paid you a nickel?"

117
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,100
And the wife says, "Everybody."

118
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,274
(laughs)

119
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,309
Oh, sorry, wrong for this audience.

120
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,186
I thought Swapper Jack's
was something else.

121
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,895
Krusty, sorry about the roast.

122
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,395
They had no right to say
those hilarious things.

123
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,158
How could they say
I'm past my prime?

124
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,530
Me-- the voice of Ovaltine.

125
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,368
Krusty, why don't you
talk to your dad?

126
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,333
He'll cheer you up.
He's a rabbi.

127
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,463
He must've learned something from that
giant star scroll he's always reading.

128
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,461
Kid, does talking to your dad
make you feel better?

129
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,514
Well, no, but he's not a rabbi.

130
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,918
More of a flabbi.
(snorts, laughs)

131
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,887
Why, you little...
I'll show you who's a flabbi!

132
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,348
(grunting)

133
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,888
-(muffled) No, you're not a flabbi!
-Yeah, all muscle.

134
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:33,022
-In Minnesota, I'd be a supermodel.
-Okay, I got it.

135
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,936
So, basically, I came here
so you could tell me the truth--

136
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,363
that I'm great.

137
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,691
As the Torah says--
Judgment belongs to God.

138
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,608
The Torah also says
you can't eat ham,

139
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,616
and I'm the spokesman
for HamCo Ham.

140
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,448
This is why I only call you
on Christmas and Easter.

141
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,575
Wait, wait, wait. Please, Dad.

142
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,462
Do you even think I'm funny?

143
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,959
I'm not gonna lie to you,
for funny,

144
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,460
I prefer Rabbi Rudenstein.

145
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,632
He puts the "ha" in Hanukkah
and the "levity" in Leviticus.

146
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,631
As for you, son,
if you want to know

147
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:06,553
my honest opinion of you,
you've always been... eh.

148
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,474
Go on.

149
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,813
I've always been "Eh... ntertaining"?

150
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,062
Dad?

151
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,897
Show me nose fog.

152
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,821
Oh, God, he's dead.

153
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,239
And he never lived
to see me be successful.

154
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,899
(sobbing)

155
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,619
<i>A pusten fas hilcht hecher.</i>

156
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,326
"An empty barrel reverberates loudly."

157
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,297
And today, my heart is that barrel.

158
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,048
Even though my father and I
had our difficulties...

159
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,221
(sobs) he was a great man.

160
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,090
And, well, he always...

161
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,512
-Wha...
-Eh.

162
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,347
ALL: Eh.

163
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,682
(continues)

164
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,357
(sighs)
Look, I'm an entertainer.

165
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,531
So maybe the best way to say
how I feel about my dad

166
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,361
is through a song

167
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,196
that someone else wrote
that I hired people to sing.

168
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,832
This is for you, Dad.

well, I thought...

174
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,427
Seriously, it can be really tough
to lose your father.

175
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,601
(crying)

176
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,935
<i>Yasher Co-ack.</i>
Let us all please rise.

177
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,806
-(snoring)
-Homer, get up.

178
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,227
Huh? Oh, uh...

179
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,685
(grunting)

180
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,276
Oh! Oh!

181
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,401
Ooh! (panting)

182
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,068
Dad, are you okay?

183
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,446
Yeah, yeah, great. (sighs)

184
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,504
I guess my getting-up days are over.

185
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,658
(gasps)

186
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,829
(Homer humming)

187
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,837
{\an8}Dad, you're eating too much.

188
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,629
{\an8}I'm worried about your health.

189
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,512
{\an8}I don't want to lose you.

190
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,390
(softly) Oh, no.

191
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,598
Krusty, I brought some
homemade chicken soup.

192
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,220
We used the Play-Doh maker
for the matzo.

193
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,187
Uh, thanks,
but I don't really like soup.

194
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,899
But you wear that little spoon
around your neck.

195
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,440
{\an8}(chuckles)
You really notice stuff, don't you?

196
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,614
Yes. And I can tell
how hard it was to lose your father.

197
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,445
But at least you were there
to share his final thoughts.

198
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,411
-Eh.
-No, no, it's a big thing.

199
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,002
No, that's what he called me. "Eh."

200
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,868
Well, it could be worse.

201
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,205
-Oh, yeah? How?
-I don't know, uh...

202
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,961
how about...
(blows raspberry)

203
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,672
That's a lot worse.

204
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,672
Can you stop comforting me now?

205
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,134
Krusty, condolences on your loss.

206
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,086
So this is the Bob

207
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:58,057
whose comedic genius

208
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,469
I can never live up to.

209
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:04,058
Believe me, all of us
have thought about killing him.

210
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,685
(sighs)

211
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,399
Clowns have it tough, Krusty.
I understand.

212
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:16,116
I was Professor Pickles with
Ringling Brothers for several years.

213
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,278
The elephant and I
had our differences.

214
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,287
So, what brings you here?
And don't say clown car.

215
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,120
I'm a sad, tragic clown.

216
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,536
Like what's his name-- Liberace.

217
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,626
Tell me about your father, huh?

218
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,919
Ah!

219
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,127
Herschel, did you read your Exodus?

220
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,887
Oh, uh, oh, sure.

221
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,809
Really? Then tell me,
what did the burning bush say?

222
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,559
It said, "Ow! Put me out!

223
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,101
How many talking bushes
do you think there are?!"

224
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,935
-(laughs)
-My son,

225
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,440
you are a big needy nothing
that only laughs can fill.

226
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,573
(scoffs) I don't need laughs.

227
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,651
-Ha.
-Oh, thank you. Thank you.

228
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,157
A big needy nothing.

229
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,079
-(sniffles)
-Wow. Wow.

230
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,238
Krusty, would you like a therapy dog?

231
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,407
Yeah. With extra relish!

232
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,496
Hey-hey! I still got it, huh?

233
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,381
Yes, if by "it" you mean

234
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,588
reflexive denial of your inner sadness.

235
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,749
(sadly) Hey-hey.

236
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,086
SIDESHOW MEL:
Shut up, children.

237
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,472
Boys and girls, you know
that we've been dark

238
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,350
for a couple of days because of
a tragic loss in the Krustylu family.

239
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,350
Now put your hands together

240
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,562
for the man who's falling apart
before our eyes,

241
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,194
Krusty the Clown!

242
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,771
(kids cheering)

243
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,026
(jaunty theme music plays)

244
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,109
No monologue. Roll the cartoon.

245
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,244
(swing creaking)

246
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,249
Oh, my God!

247
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,579
Who made this monstrosity?

248
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,166
<i>I did everything!</i>

249
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:54,001
Kids, I'm experiencing
a crisis of conscience.

250
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,588
<i>(canned applause)</i>

251
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,093
No, no, no, no!

252
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,724
I don't deserve the prerecorded applause
of children long gone.

253
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,473
<i>-(canned applause)</i>
<i>-KID (over recording): I like Ike!</i>

254
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,726
Therefore, I'm quitting the show.

255
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,768
And I know Mel
will be quitting it with me.

256
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,312
Yes, yes, buy the house.
It'll be...

257
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,766
Uh, what?!

258
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,526
Today is the day the pity laughter died.

259
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,688
Krusty the Clown has retired.

260
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,107
For a brief overview
of a half-century of ha-has,

261
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,696
here is Channel Six TV critic
Clive Meriwether.

262
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,742
Krusty the Clown
will perhaps best be remembered

263
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:28,077
for taking up two spots
in the Channel Six parking lot.

264
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:32,004
On a personal level,
he used to call me Little Lord Tingaling.

265
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,424
I shan't miss that.

266
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,762
This man's only lasting legacies
are a law in his name

267
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,629
limiting the working hours
of chimpanzees to 14 hours a day

268
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,678
and the invention
of the payment of alimony

269
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,142
by dropping hot pennies
from a helicopter.

270
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,352
I give his life a D-plus.

271
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,733
Good day to you.

272
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,309
What will Krusty do now?

273
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,484
I suppose only time will tell.

274
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,653
Which is true
for all news stories, I guess.

275
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,032
Until anyone realizes,

276
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,488
I'm Kent Brockman
adding no useful information.

277
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,279
And here's another sentence.

278
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,322
You can tell I'm winding it up
because my voice is going <i>up</i>

279
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,527
and <i>down</i> like this.

280
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,790
Well, at least now I have plenty of time

281
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,962
to solve this Rubik's Cube.

282
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,501
All right, what if I did...

283
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,754
Oh!

284
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,928
(Homer snoring unevenly)

285
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,719
(snoring, gasping)

286
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,064
-(quietly) Mom, Dad.
-Yes, Lisa?

287
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,969
(snores) What?

288
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,138
I've been listening,
and Dad stops breathing

289
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,477
for as long as five minutes.

290
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,322
Mind if I sleep with you guys
and keep an eye on him?

291
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,358
Sweetie, you shouldn't have to worry
about such things.

292
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,323
(gasps, snores, wheezing)

293
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,454
The doctor gave us this machine
to help him breathe in his sleep.

294
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,493
Go to bed. I'll take care of him.

295
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,161
{\an8}<i>No good. No good.</i>

296
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,496
{\an8}<i>Oh! Ooh! Ah!</i>

297
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,330
{\an8}<i>-(gasping)</i>
<i>-What do I do? What do I do?</i>

298
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,745
{\an8}<i>Oh. Breathe, Homie, breathe.</i>

299
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,956
{\an8}<i>(coughing)</i>

300
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,982
Well, at least Teeny's doing okay.

301
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,901
He's in <i>The Odd Couple</i>
with David Hyde Pierce.

302
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,481
Now, really, Oscar,
would it kill you to use a coaster?

303
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,397
(screeching)

304
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,736
If you're going to go up there,
at least dust!

305
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,491
Finally, done the way
I first imagined it.

306
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,868
I'm gonna prove
you did groundbreaking work.

307
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:36,415
Krusty, I want you to binge-watch
all the shows you've ever done.

308
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,920
Well, I've never said no to a binge.

309
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,384
(static crackles)

310
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,303
<i>Deuteronomy?</i>
<i>Isn't that the study of deuters?</i>

311
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,843
<i>Hippocampus?</i>

312
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:49,136
<i>Isn't that another name for</i>
<i>the University of Mississippi?</i>

313
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,851
Okay. I've been on 50 years.

314
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,811
You're bound
to repeat yourself a little.

315
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,732
<i>Unless I wanted to be sat on</i>
<i>by Mama Cass.</i>

316
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,981
<i>Unless I wanted to be</i>
<i>sat on by Dom DeLuise.</i>

317
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,234
<i>...by the cast of</i>
What's Happening!!

318
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,397
<i>...William "The Refrigerator" Perry,</i>
<i>everyone!</i>

319
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,565
<i>...Newman from </i>Seinfeld.

320
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,414
<i>...the whale from </i>Whale Rider.

321
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,989
<i>...Adele! (laughs)</i>

322
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,615
<i>What? She's a guest star?!</i>

323
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,662
<i>(sobbing)</i>

324
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,076
(groans)

325
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,754
(static hissing)

326
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:20,882
So that's why
all my cameramen have PTSD.

327
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,671
Where's my whiskey funnel?!

328
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,337
(German accent)
Young man, you should go.

329
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,684
When the master is like this,
it is no place for children.

330
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,511
Pour, Helga!

331
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,466
It begins.

332
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,516
(gulping)

333
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,976
(angelic choir singing)

334
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,188
Whoa. Where am I?

335
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,697
Why, you're in Jewish Heaven.

336
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,239
Oh, this place is great.

337
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,282
Why, my necktie straightens itself.

338
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,740
Even Portnoy has no complaints.

339
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,997
And I tell you,
I get so much respect.

340
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,580
Wow. So I made it to Heaven.

341
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,326
{\an8}(klezmer playing)

342
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,174
(crowd cheering)

343
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,428
This place is amazing!

344
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,774
Schmuck, there's no Jewish Heaven.

345
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:19,229
Our faith teaches us
that once you're dead, that's it, kaput.

346
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,771
It's dark, it's cold.

347
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,734
It's like that apartment we lived in
before I started doing weddings.

348
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,856
But you, my son, remain...

349
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,494
Eh?! (groans)

350
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,083
Go back to Earth.

351
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,658
Do something with your life.
Help people.

00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,999
Nothing. I'm not getting a pulse.

356
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,964
I got to change my life!

357
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,384
Still no pulse.

358
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,512
I guess I'm just really bad at this.

00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,322
with keeping her father out of danger.

363
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,359
She's gotten our Resusci Annie doll

<i>(wheezes) Why?</i>

365
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,370
{\an8}In this new shelter,
we provide a home

366
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,289

by Cirque du Soleil.

(gorilla growls)

368
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,793
Um, Krusty, have you fulfilled
the promise you made to your father

369
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,035
in the dream
you never told anyone about?

370
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,377
Uh, no.

371
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:31,012
Somehow a brief act of uncharacteristic
generosity solved nothing.

372
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,381
-Hey, Krusty.
-What?

373
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,798
Have you been going to temple?

374
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,806
Yeah, and I've learned that
all religions are equally boring.

375
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,430
But there's a reason I went.
Come and see.

376
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,767
Kid, there's no way
you can cheer me up.

377
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,983
Not when whiskey,
good deeds, and hookers failed.

378
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,145
Who's a hooker?

379
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:51,152
Uh, with me, it's easier to say
which ones aren't hookers.

380
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,487
Hmm?

381
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,163
(grunting)

382
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,661
Lisa, what are you doing?

383
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,043
Wrapping you in bubble wrap.

384
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,079
I can't always be around
to protect you, so it will.

385
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,874
But...

386
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,037
-(bubble wrap popping)
-Oh, Lisa, honey,

387
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,626
you can't insulate yourself from life.

388
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,422
Why, I could live till 100
or a bus could hit me tomorrow.

389
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:16,298
That's why I never plan
more than four seconds ahead.

390
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,966
Oh, I guess you're right.

391
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,676
Now come on.
Give Daddy a hug.

392
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,557

393
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,403
-Bubble wrap!
-(bubble wrap popping)

394
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,941
Your daughterly love saved me, sweetie.

395
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:33,605
That's all I wanted,
a tiny bit of control.

396
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,655
Ooh. I suppose we should
exchange insurance information.

397
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,330
-I don't have any.
-Me neither.

398
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,988
Then we have the same company.

399
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,867
They'll work it all out.

400
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,464

00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,586

403
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,917
Today's reading is from Deuteronomy,

404
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,085
which I believe is the study of deuters.

405
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,434
(laughter)

406
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,049

Eh, must be a coincidence.

00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,256
Uh, but before we begin,

409
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,637
I'd like to quote the burning bush,
which said, "Hey, put me out.

410
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,555
How many talking bushes
do you think there are?"

411
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,904
Hey-hey.

00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,442
Me again.

414
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,073
So if Dad loved his jokes, then...

415
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,151
Dad loved my jokes.

00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,155
Yeah, I guess he just
hated your delivery.

418
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,990
He loved my jokes.

419
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:24,616
