{\an8}We're from

00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,327
{\an8}We'd like to talk to you about

17
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,159
{\an8}an exciting employment
opportunity

18
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,454
{\an8}in our nuclear division.

{\an8}We're prepared to offer you

{\an8}plus health benefits for
you and your life partner.

22
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,379
{\an8}The answer is no.

23
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,343
{\an8}What's wrong with
this country?

24
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,933
{\an8}Can't a man walk

{\an8}Marge, I got a new job!

{\an8}It's with Globex Corporation.

33
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,778
{\an8}I get more money
plus health benefits

34
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,568
{\an8}for me and my life partner.

35
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,452
And, they'll move us and give us
a nice house and liv--

36
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,619
-Move us?
-It's in Cypress Creek, upstate somewhere.

37
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,328
You took a new job
in a strange town

38
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,198
without discussing it
with your family?

39
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,655
Of course not.

40
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,325
I wouldn't do that.
Why not?

41
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,254
We have roots here, Homer.

42
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,843
We have friends
and family

43
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,668
and library cards.

44
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,303
Bart's lawyer is here.

45
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,220
But Marge,
this is a chance for me

46
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,339
to fulfill
my lifelong dream.

47
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,216
What lifelong dream?

48
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,313
Promise not to laugh?

49
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,560
I always wanted to own
the Dallas Cowboys.

50
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,603
(laughing)

51
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,319
I'm sorry, Dad.

52
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,189
I just find that very cute.

53
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,566
Homer, I don't want
to leave Springfield.

54
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,913
I've dug myself into
a happy little rut here

55
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,489
and I'm not about
to hoist myself out of it.

56
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,235
Just bring the rut
with you, honey.

57
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,736
Come on, take a look.

58
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,997
Uh, let's watch
something else.

59
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,337
Homer, you're trying to talk us
into moving to this place.

60
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,013
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Let's watch this.

61
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,262
WOMAN:
<i>Look at this place.</i>

62
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,854

00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,105

<i>a planned community designed for</i>
<i>the workers of the Globex Corporation.</i>

66
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,241
<i>Cypress Creek--</i>
<i>where dreams come true.</i>

00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,036
ANNOUNCER 2: <i>Your dreams</i>
<i>may vary from those</i>

68

<i>of Globex Corporation, its</i>
<i>subsidiaries and shareholders.</i>

69
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,290
Well, what do you
think of me

70
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,083
and Cypress Creek now, Marge?

71
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,047
It does seem nicer
than Springfield.

72
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,878
Yeah, did you notice how
the people weren't shoving

73
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,633
or knocking
each other down?

74
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,795
I've never been to a place
like that before.

75
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,894
-(cries out)
-Me neither.

76
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,927
Well, we could use
the extra money,

77
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,184
and this house
is falling apart.

78
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,517
All right.

79
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,902
(cheering)

80
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,743
Oh, wow! Windows.
(chuckles)

81
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,148
I don't think I can
afford this place.

82
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,738
(doorbell chimes)

83
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,742
Hello. I am not interested
in buying the house,

84
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,414
but I would like
to use your rest room,

85
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,123
flip through your magazines,

86
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,083
rearrange your carefully
shelved items,

87
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,923
and handle your food products
in an unsanitary manner.

88
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,879
Ha! Now you know
how it feels!

89
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,591
Thank you. Come again.

90
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,341
We'll never sell
this rotten dump.

91
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,391
A little help here.

92
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,178
Even if we sell the house,

93
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,312
we still don't come close
to paying off the mortgage.

94
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,179
-Hey.
-Hey.

95
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,824
Uh... Homer, ah...

96
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,901
about those things you borrowed
from me over the years,

97
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,238
you know, the TV trays,
the power sander,

98
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,743
the downstairs bathtub,

99
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,576
you going to be needing
those things in Cypress Creek?

100
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,162
-Yes.
-Oh, uh...

101
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,458
Okily dokily...

102
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,212
Okily dokily.

103
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,715
-(tires screech)
-Bye-diddly-I.

104
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,681
-So long.
-God bless you.

105
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,351
-See ya.
-Good-bye.

106
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,680
-Bye-bye, Homer.
-Take care.

107
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,265
-Adios.
-So long.

108
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,480
Fare thee well.

109
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,980
Arr. Bon voyage.

110
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,191
Toodle-oo.

111
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,191
So long.

112
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,322
-Bye-bye.
-Ta-ta.

113
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,398
-Bye, everybody.
-Bye-bye.

114
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,323
-Sayonara, dudes.
-So long.

115
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,612
-ALL: Bye-bye!
-Bye-bye, now.

116
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,066
-Bye.
-See ya.

117
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,116
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

118
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,658
Ha-ha.

119
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,452
I'm gonna
miss Springfield.

120
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,575
This town's been
awfully good to us.

121
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,332
No, it hasn't, Dad.

122
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,424
That's why
we're leaving.

123
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,458
Oh, yeah.

124
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,751
So long, stinktown!

125
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,769
{\an8}It says here, one of these
giant redwood trees

126
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,311
{\an8}can provide
enough sawdust to cover

127
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,515
{\an8}an entire day's worth
of vomit at Disneyland.

128
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,856
ALL:
Ooh.

129
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:02,991
Ahh.

130
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,991
Ohh.

131
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,334
Ooh.

132
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,909
Here we are:

133
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,834
15201 Maple Systems Road--

134
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,294
Our new home.

135
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,214
(whistles)

136
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,255
I call this room.

137
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,929
(knocking)

138
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,679
I am here to welcome you

139
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,311
on behalf of the President
of the Globex Corporation.

140
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,889
Me. Try the papayas.

141
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:32,984
They're juicy
and full of papayine.

142
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,939
Makes you strong
like Popeye.

143
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,019
Popeye, papayine.
Popeye, papayine.

144
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,315
See? Same thing.
Same... Ah, forget it.

145
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,779
How are you?
I'm Hank Scorpio.

146
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,818
Wow, my boss.

147
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,282
Don't call me that word.

148
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,742
I don't like things
that elevate me

149
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,412
above the other people.
I'm just like you.

150
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,080
Oh, sure, I come
later in the day,

151
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,238
I get paid a lot more
and I take longer vacations,

152
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,157
but I don't like
the word "boss."

153
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,156
-Hey, look at my feet.
-Okay.

154
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,537
You like those moccasins? Look in
your closet. There's a pair for you.

155
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,375
Don't like them? Then neither do I.
Get the hell out of here!

156
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,921
Ha! Ever see a guy
say good-bye to a shoe?

157
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,508
Yes, once.

158
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,259
Mr. Scorpio, this house
is almost too good for us.

159
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,803
I keep expecting
to get the bum's rush.

160
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,057
We don't have bums in our town, Marge,
and if we did, they wouldn't rush.

161
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,770
They'd be allowed to go
at their own pace.

162
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,480
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm in the middle of a fun run.

163
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,231
See you at work tomorrow.

164
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,362
Although I don't really like
to call it work.

165
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,938
Whoa.

166
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,906
Okay, the oven
is cleaning itself.

167
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,753
The Autovac's on dirt patrol.

168
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,249
(beeping, whirring)

169
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,961
And Maggie's enjoying
her swing-a-majig.

170
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,684
(whimpering)

171
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,588
I can't believe it.

172
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,927
I've done all my housework,
and it's only 9:30.

173
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,144
Well, better go upstairs

174
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,144
and make sure the beds
are still made.

175
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,358
You will notice,
my new best friend,

176
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,283
that we are pretty
casual around here.

177
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,031
Yes, sir.
I will notice that.

178
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,324
Very casual, Mr. Scorpion.

179
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,327
Don't call me "Mr. Scorpion."

180
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,119
It's "Mr. Scorpio,"
but don't call me that, either.

181
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,503
Call me Hank.
Say, before we continue our tour,

182
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,830
would you mind hanging my coat
up on the wall, please?

183
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,246
Mm-hmm. Um, uh...
Let's see, um...

184
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,836
-Well, uh...
-(laughing )

185
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,472
Relax, Homer.

186
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,258
At Globex,
we don't believe in walls.

187
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,432
Matter of fact, I didn't even
give you my coat.

188
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,561
Hmm?

189
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,019
Wow.

190
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,228
Having a place like this

191
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,728
has always been
my dream, Homer.

192
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,139
What's your dream?

193
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,688
Uh, to work for you?

194
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,271
Don't do that.

195
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,646
My butt is for sitting,
not for kissing.

196
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,362
Now you tell me the truth.

197
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,152
What's your real dream?
Your <i>real</i> dream!

198
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:52,906
Um, someday, I'd... like
to own the Dallas Cowboys.

199
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,950
I bet people laughed at you
when you told 'em that dream.

200
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,874
-Yeah.
-Homer, don't give up.

201
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,293
They laughed at me the first time
I wore jeans with a sport coat.

202
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,883
I was the first wealthy man
in America to ever do that.

203
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,669
Now they <i>all</i> do it.

204
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,802
-Did you ever hear of Mike Milken?
-Yeah-- No.

205
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,089
-Hi there.
-Hey, how you doing?

206
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,683
Now, Homer, these gentlemen here
will be your eyes and your ears,

207
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,339
and should the need arise,
they'll fill in

208
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,927
for any other
part of your body.

209
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:17,392
Your job will be to manage
and motivate them.

210
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,683
Give them the benefit of your
years of experience.

211
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,477
Don't worry,
that won't take long.

212
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,401
The key to
motivation is trust.

213
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,859
Let me show you what I mean.
I want you to close your eyes

214
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,570
and fall backwards,
and I'll catch you.

215
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,690
That's gonna show you what
trust is all about. Ready?

216
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,147
-Alright.
-Three, two...

217
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,448
-(phone ringing )
-One second.

218
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,571
-Hello?
-D-ohh!

219
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,987
Oh, my God,
a guy's on the floor.

220
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,075
That was a phone call.

221
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,409
Don't chalk that up
to mistrust, now.

222
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,334
Yes? What happened?

223
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,543
When did that happen?
How much of it?

224
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,423
Oh my goodness,
I'll be right up.

225
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,790
Homer, I got to go upstairs.
There's a problem.

226
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,796
Somebody ate part
of my lunch.

227
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,008
I'm gonna leave
everything to you.

228
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,298
We're on a
tight schedule.

229
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,801
You keep them motivated.

230
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,425
Are you guys working?

231
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,353
Yes, sir, Mr. Simpson.

232
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,442
Could you, um,
work any harder than this?

233
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,978
Sure thing, boss.

234
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,322
Hey, call me Homer.

235
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,492
(making armpit noises)

236
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,624
You got a fresh sound.

237
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,912
It will play well
at this school.

238
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:25,326
Hey Bart, do you have
a best friend yet?

239
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,626
'Cause I've been looking
for someone to boss me around.

240
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,011
Okay, folks,
let's do it to it.

241
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,008
(chuckling)

242
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,469
Grammar, that is.

243
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,589
Uh, everybody write down
this sentence

244
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,836
and circle the nouns.

245
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,965
Bart, as the newest addition
to our menagerie,

246
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,178
you have the honors.

247
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:46,097
Um... uh...

248
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,357
Well, let's start
by reading the sentence.

249
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,779
"Two wintim

250
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:55,198
amd jawwy wirt... "
(trails off)

251
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,452
(armpit noise)

252
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,199
So, you never
learned cursive?

253
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,787
Um, well, I know "hell"
and "damn" and "bit--"

254
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,543
Cursive handwriting, script.

255
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,745
Do you know
the multiplication tables?

256
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:10,835
Long division?

257
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,590
-I know of them.
-Hmm...

258
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,803
You know, Bart,
I think you'd profit

259
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,473
from a more
remedial environment.

260
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,852
And I'm sure you'll feel
right at home in...

261
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,181
the Leg-Up Program.

262
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,766
(gasps)

263
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,236
(groans)

264
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,155
Guess I can't complain.

265
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,294
Everything's perfect here.

266
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,549
(ominous music playing)

267
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,973
So, what are you in for?

268
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:03,140
I moved here from Canada,
and they think I'm slow, eh?

269
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,642
I fell off the jungle gym,

270
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,234
and when I woke up,
I was in here.

271
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,439
I start fires.

272
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,271
Okay, now, everyone
take out your safety pencil

273
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,107
and a circle of paper.

274
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:18,492
This week, I hope we can finish
our work on the letter "A."

275
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,071
Let me get this straight.

276
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,316
We're behind
the rest of our class,

277
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,698
and we're going to catch up to them
by going slower than they are?

278
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,076
Cuckoo.

279
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,043
ALL: Cuckoo, cuckoo,
cuckoo, cuckoo...

280
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,543
Stop it. Stop it!

281
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,594
Warren! Melvin!
Gary! Dot! Gordy!

282
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,418
Look, lady, I'm supposed
to be in the fourth grade.

283
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,724
Sounds to me like someone's
got a case of "the s'pose'das."

284
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,009
(groans)

285
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,180
-(hard slap)
-Warren!

286
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,728
Wild flowers!

287
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,233
We don't have you
in Springfield.

288
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,316
(chittering )

289
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,240
Hello, Mr. Chipmunk.

290
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:01,199
You're a northern
reticulated chipmunk.

291
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,950
Yes, you are.

292
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,122
You are so reticulated.

293
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,411
Hi, Mrs. Owl.

294
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,035
You're out kind of early.

295
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,711
<i>♪ La-la-la, la-la... ♪</i>

296
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,500
(hooting)

297
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,547
Mr. Scorpio says productivity
is up two percent,

298
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,892
and it's all because
of <i>my</i> motivational techniques,

299
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:27,138
like doughnuts and the possibility
of more doughnuts to come.

300
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,393
I knew you'd
do well, Homer.

301
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,135
Sports collectibles.

302
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,478
Wow, a baseball made
out of Secretariat.

303
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,234
(gasping )

304
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,566
Tom Landry's hat,
and it's autographed.

305
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,323
"To Berman's Dry Cleaning.

306
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,284
Best wishes, Tom Landry."

307
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,116
Why don't you buy it?

308
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,831
I can't buy that.

309
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,161
Only management-type guys
with big salaries like me

310
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,787
can afford things like that.

311
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,713
(gasps)
Guys like me.

312
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,252
I'm a guy like me.

313
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,665
All right, team,
it's the fourth quarter.

314
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,094
The Lord gave us the atoms,
and it's up to us

315
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,093
to make them dance.

316
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,796
Hey, if Tom Landry's hat
doesn't motivate you,

317
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,347
then I should just
quit right now.

318
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,271
I'm sorry, we're just
a little tired, sir.

319
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,690
We've been pushing
ourselves real hard

320
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,888
to get the reactor on-line.

321
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,518
Tired, eh?

322
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,024
What you guys need
is hammocks.

323
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,238
Uh, hi, Homer.
What can I do for you?

324
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,662
Sir, I need to know where can I get
some business hammocks?

325
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,831
Hammocks?

326
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,409
My goodness, what an idea.

327
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,374
Why didn't I think of that?
Hammocks.

328
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,464
Homer, there's
four places.

329
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,380
-There's the Hammock Hut. That's on Third.
-Uh-huh.

330
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,458
-There's Hammocks-R-US.
-Got it.

331
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,673
That's on Third too.

332
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,552
-You got Put-Your-Butt-There.
-Mm-hmm.

333
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,049
-That's on Third.
-Yes.

334
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,841
-Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.
-Right.

335
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,384
Matter of fact, they're all
in the same complex.

336
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,047
It's the Hammock Complex
down on Third.

337
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,136
Oh, the Hammock District.

338
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,430
That's right.

339
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,393
Ready for the linkup,
Mr. Scorpio.

340
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,813
Homer, one second.
I got to take care of this.

341
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,642
Very important.
Be right back.

342
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,727
Fine.

343
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,265
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

344
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,567
This is Scorpio.

345
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,030
I have the doomsday device.

346
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,400
You have 72 hours
to deliver the gold,

347
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,447
or you'll face
the consequences.

348
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,411
And to prove I'm not
bluffing, watch this.

349
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,948
(explosion)

350
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,788
Oh, my God,
the 59th Street bridge.

351
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,504
Maybe it just collapsed
on its own.

352
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,085
We can't take that chance.

353
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,420
You always say that.

354
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,964
I want to take a chance.

355
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,588
Collapsed on its own?

356
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,554
You... You have 72 hours.

357
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,295
See you. Back to
the hammocks, my friend.

358
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,757
-Yes.
-You know there's a little place

359
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,267
called
Mary Ann's Hammocks.

360
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,849
The nice thing
about that place

361
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,694
is Mary Ann gets in
the hammock with you.

362
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,769
-(laughs) I'm just kidding.
-Oh.

363
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,154
-You know who invented the hammock, Homer?
-No.

364
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,440
That's something for you to do.
Find that out.

365
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,658
Any sugar around here?

366
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,292
Try in there, Homer.

367
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,625
SCORPIO:
Hi, Homer.

368
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,378
I'm keeping two
of my fingers crossed

369
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,540
that you're going
to have that nuclear generator

370
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,208
up to full power by tomorrow.

371
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,796
Yes, sir. No problemo.

372
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,801
Good. By the way, Homer.

373
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,053
What's your least favorite country?
Italy or France?

374
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,595
-France.
-(chuckling)

375
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,889
Nobody ever says Italy.

376
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,151
I never noticed
this office before.

377
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,559
Why should you?
It's mine.

378
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,227
Eh, you have any
sugar around here?

379
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,565
Sugar? Sure.

380
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,704
There you go.

381
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,568
Sorry it's not in packages.
Want some cream?

382
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,826
Uh... ye... no.

383
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,632

(sneezes)

397
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,362
Excuse me.

398
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,082
Oh, my eyes are burning.

399
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:20,372

00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,706
(coughing)

401
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,591
Oh, little chipmunk friend.

402
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,209
I'm allergic to everything.

403
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,052
-(sneezes)
-(chitters)

404
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,183

405
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,220
-(sneezing continues)
-(birds chirping)

406
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,519
(machine powering up)

407
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:45,442
Ingenious,
isn't it, Mr. Bont?

408
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,362
Scorpio, you're totally mad.

409
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,741
Heh. I wouldn't
point fingers, you jerk.

410
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,738
So, do you expect
me to talk?

411
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,410
I don't expect anything
from you,

412
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,409
except to die
and be a very cheap funeral.

413
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,121
You're going to die now.

414
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,044
(grunts)

415
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,344
Stop him!
He's supposed to die!

416
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,100
Nice work, Homer.
Am I proud of you.

417
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,808
Well...

418
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,468
When you go home tonight,
there's going to be

419
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,306
another story
on your house.

420
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,391
-Thank you.
-(guns firing)

421
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:27,607
I tackled a loafer
at work today.

422
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,319
Hey, what's with
you sad sacks?

423
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,360
I'm allergic
to everything here.

424
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,034
My nose is so stuffed up

425
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,073
I can't even taste Mom's
delicious boiled celery.

426
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,367
I've been so bored
since we moved here,

427
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,951
I found myself drinking
a glass of wine every day.

428
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,537
I know doctors say you should
drink a glass and a half,

429
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,503
but I just can't
drink that much.

430
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,553
Well, the Simpson men
are doing fine, right, Bart?

431
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,798
You haven't even gotten
in trouble at school.

432
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,670
I can't get in trouble
at school.

433
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,717
They put me
in the remedial class.

434
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,141
I'm surrounded by arsonists

435
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,299
and kids with mittens
pinned to their jackets

436
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,427
all year 'round.

437
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,930
Hey, Dad...

438
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,686
ALL: We want to go back
to Springfield.

439
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,269
What? We've got it great here.

440
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,225
And for the first time
in my life,

441
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,525
I'm actually good
at my job.

442
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:16,029
My team is way ahead of the weather
machine and germ warfare divisions.

443
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,283
It's up to you, Homer.

444
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,025
Whatever you decide,
that's what we'll do.

445
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,788
(whimpers)

446
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,474
WOMAN (on P.A.): <i>"T" minus</i>
<i>one minute, 35 seconds.</i>

447
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,015
Uh... I've got
a problem, Hank.

448
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,024
Oh, gee, Homer,
could it wait a sec, please?

449
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,146
Well, it's pretty important.

450
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:57,113
-(grunting)
-Say, what's going on?

451
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,696
I'm having a little
trouble with the government.

452
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,660
Oh, those jerks always walking
over the small businessman.

453
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,242
Don't get me started
about the government.

454
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,448
What's the problem?

455
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,167
Well, my family wants to
move back to Springfield.

456
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,578
Let them go. You'll stay here with me,
we'll go bowling.

457
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,127
What's bothering them?

458
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,461
Nothing big.
It's just a lot of little things.

459
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,466
Well, you can't argue
with the little things.

460
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,548
It's the little things
that make up life.

461
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,927
Homer, I'm disappointed,

462
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,932
but I think you need to do
what's best for your family.

463
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,564
Well, thanks
for everything, Hank.

464
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,942
WOMAN (on P.A.):
<i>"T" minus 14 seconds.</i>

465
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,439
If you need
anything, you call me.

466
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,730
Alright, what's the number?

467
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,403
I've never had to call
my own company.

468
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,442
Someone will tell you upstairs.
But Homer, on your way out,

469
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,526
if you want to kill somebody,
it would help me a lot.

470
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,660
(evil laughter )

471
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,170
Hey, Homer,
you're missing out on some fun.

472
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,187
Uh-oh. Sorry.

473
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,483
Let me just get
my girlfriend, and I'll go.

474
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,317
