Hang on. Here's a spot
that still looks good.

(panting)

20
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,202
So, do we have a winner?

21
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,283
{\an8}HOMER: Hmm...

22
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,075
{\an8}Not ugly enough.

23
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,832
{\an8}I want something
that looks like this...

24
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,294
{\an8}BART:
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

25
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,883
{\an8}...had a baby with this,

26
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,998
{\an8}and it got sat on by this.

27
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,296
{\an8}I think I've come up
with the answer.

28
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,220
{\an8}Oh... my... God!

29
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,221
(sweetly): You never fail
to nauseate me, boy.

30
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:39,644
(laughs)
Just call me "Barf Simpson."

31
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,234
I wanted to,

32
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,389
but your mother said
kids might tease you.

33
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,735
(chuckling)

34
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,739
Half an hour to showtime,
your ugliness.

35
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,861
Dad, do you realize

36
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,487
we've put more time
into this

37
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,743
than all my schoolwork
combined?

38
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,446
But if we win this,
we get a gift certificate.

39
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,787
For what?

40
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,251
(chuckles)
It doesn't matter.

{\an8}How ya doin'?

44
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,603
{\an8}I need a diaper
for my chimp

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,930
{\an8}that won't upset
my tiger's stomach

46
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,684
{\an8}if he eats the chimp.

47
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,186
{\an8}Fear not.
Our chimp diapers have

48
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:28,019
{\an8}that nutty cinnamon taste
tigers love.

49

50
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,574
{\an8}Mmm!
It's a great time to be a tiger.

(kids laughing)

52
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,573
{\an8}Mr. Flanders,
how did you make

53
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,867
{\an8}these amazing fish?

54
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,870
{\an8}(chuckles) Actually,
God made some fish

55
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,622
{\an8}that were pretty
close to these,

56
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,294
{\an8}so naturally we selected those
for further breeding.

57
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:49,753
{\an8}So that natural selection was
the origin of this species?

58
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,746
{\an8}Yup, that's exactly...

59
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,257
{\an8}Whoa-oa-oa!

60
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,798
You almost got me.

61
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,176
(gasping)

62
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,680
Not on my watch!

00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,234
{\an8}This seat taken?

67
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,277
{\an8}Uh, yes,
I'm saving it for...

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,700
{\an8}this soy sauce packet.

69
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,318
Aw, man, you know
you're a loser

70
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,325
when they don't even work hard
on the excuse.

71
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,238
I'll just sit here, then.

72
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,706
Thanks a lot, everyone.

73
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,829
Choke on yourselves.

74
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,957
Ah, here we go.

75
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,134
Oh, no, you don't.

76
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,840
{\an8}(grumbling)

77
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:41,929
(panting)

78
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,353
Whoa, that one's so ugly,

79
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,891
{\an8}it reminds me
of my ex-wife! Hah!

80
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,766
{\an8}(laughs feebly)

81
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,268
That one reminds me
of her lawyer.

82
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,439
Congress...

83
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,815

Hey, clown, we've heard
your stand-up!

87
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,531
{\an8}Now how about
some shut-up!

{\an8}(all laughing)

89
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,285
Everybody's a comedian.

90
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,162
{\an8}Except you!

91
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,868
{\an8}(all laughing)

92
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,958
{\an8}Well, why don't <i>you </i>come up

-Do it, Moe!
-Come on, Moe!

94
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,710
Entertain us!

95
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,507
Well, I guess
I could. Uh...

96
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,220
{\an8}At least
I'd get a chair.

97
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,310
Check it out.

98
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,520

101
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,024
I don't wanna say it's ugly,

102
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,685
but PETA called and said
we should kill this one.

103
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,284
(all laugh)

104
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,029
{\an8}And now, owned by one
of the ugliest families

105
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,492
{\an8}in Springfield...

106
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,911
{\an8}Satan's Little Helper!

107
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,544
(all gasp)

108
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,248
Oh! Whoa!

109
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,328
Even the Koreans
wouldn't touch this dog!

110
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,874

111
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,667
{\an8}(whines)

112
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,790
We have a winner!

113
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,336
(all cheer)

114
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,721
{\an8}-Oh...
-(smooches)

115
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,011
{\an8}Ooh, everyone's coming over
to congratulate us!

116
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,716
{\an8}Humble faces, kids!

117
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,966
{\an8}Humbler!

118
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:11,387
{\an8}Lisa, too humble.

{\an8}You're hilarious!

122

{\an8}Judge my baby!

123
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,784
{\an8}Say something cruel
about me!

124
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,649
{\an8}Would you do
my kid's birthday party?

125
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,896
{\an8}ALL (chanting):
Moe! Moe! Moe!

126
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,908
{\an8}Wow, they love me for my bile.

127
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,910
{\an8}And I got a spleenful!

128
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,622
{\an8}Hel-lo!

129
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,171
No, no, no, I don't need your
fair-weather friendship...

130
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,959
(dejected purr)

131
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,713
...is what I'll say
tomorrow morning! (chuckles)

132
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,933
<i>CARL: Man, you sure saved</i>
<i>that dog show.</i>

133
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,050
Moe, you were hilarious.

134
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,927
Ah, I was just doin'
what comes naturally to me;

135
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,394
being mean to animals.

136
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,984
Uh, excuse me, sir.

137
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,901
I was wondering
if you would judge

138
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,729
an outrageous beard contest
I'm in tonight.

139
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,565
Well, uh, anyone can get
a laugh

140
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,070
at the expense
of an ugly dog.

141
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,452
But crazy beards?

142
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,988
That's where
the big boys play.

143
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,572
-You got
the gift, baby!
-Come on, Moe.

144
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,696
Can you make it sound
like girls askin' me?

145
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,584
-Oh, Moe,
please do it! Oh!
-Please? Moe, please?

146
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,411
(chuckles) Okay, you crazy
dames, I'll do it!

147
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,078
(all giggling girlishly)

148
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,706
Which means this joint is closed
for the night.

149
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,214
-Don't be that way!
-You kidding me?

150
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,585
You can't close!

151
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,631
I'll have to go home
and drink better beer

152
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,675
at half the price
in natural lighting!

153
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,260
(sighs) I didn't want
to have to do this.

154
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,267
(all shrieking)

155
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,520
Yeah, that's right!
Scatter, ya cockroaches!

156
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,942
Mr. Szyslak, would you like
to buy some band candy?

157
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,732
That doesn't work
on me.

158
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:40,816
Oh, yeah?

159
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,780
How 'bout this
scary face?! (shrieking)

160
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:47,741
I can see that down deep is
a decent man.

161
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,744
(sighs) Fine.

162
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,832
You're home early!

163
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,536
Oh, can't a guy rush home
from work

164
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,836
to see his beautiful...

165
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,959
Moe's is closed, huh?

166
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,165
Yeah.

167
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,255
Now what
am I supposed to do?

168
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,970
We can enjoy each
others' company.

169
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,930
Okay.

170
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,889
(both sighing)

171
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,931
Still wanna be
at Moe's?

172
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,854
She's right, Homer.
You're happier there.

173
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,644
Mr. Szyslak, you want
to buy some band candy?

174
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,977
Even in the thought bubble,
I gotta buy band candy?

175
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,277
Looks like you ate

176
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,609
a Rastafarian, and he's
comin' back up on ya!

177
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,605
(all laughing)

178
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,697
Now looky here.

179
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,491
I'm no judge of talent,

180
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,405
but I am a judge
of judging.

181
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,623
And in my judge
judgment,

182
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,083
you have a talent
for judging talent.

183
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,214
You talk like my ass plays
harmonica.

184
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,791
(laughs)
You should share

185
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,457
your hilarious hate
with everyone!

186
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,546
<i>♪ Why can't you be nicer</i>

187
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,766

189
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,400
(gasps)

190
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,818
I didn't see you come in.

191
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,236
Well, since Moe's is
closed again,

192
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,164
I thought I'd help
you cook dinner.

193
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,742
Well, I don't need
much help,

194
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,997
but you can keep me company.

195
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,001
(shrieks)

196
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,002
You know what?

197
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,133
I'll just cook this later.

198
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,419
(shrieks)

199
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,916
What are we watching?

200
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,927
Uh, I'm gonna go
read a book.

201
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,807
MARGE:
Huh?

202
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,769
After the title page,
it's Bob Dole's memoirs.

203
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,435
This is terrible!

204
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,980
I've seen better stitching on
a baseball glove!

205
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,864
Can I have another corpse?

206
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,531
They weren't corpses.

207
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,939
Uh-oh.

208
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,448
Moe Szyslak?

209
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,582
I'm from U.C.A.A.,
the Uncreative Artists Agency.

210
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,949
We represent some
of the biggest stars on TV.

211
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,616
TV, huh?
That crap still on?

212
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,584
Yes, sir. Never been crappier.

213
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,625
Listen, Moe,
reality shows are
looking for judges,

214
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,788
and you're that
mythical creature

215
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,586
we thought we would
never find:

216
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,510
you're mean, you're funny
and you're not British!

217
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,168
I am <i>so </i>not British.

218
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,677
Don't let this pasty face
and bad teeth fool ya.

219
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,719
Perfect!

220
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,222
So, what kind of reality shows

221
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,433
are we talkin' about here?

222
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,853
Well, to name
just a few:

223
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,891
<i>America's Ripest Bananas,</i>
<i>So You Think You Can Judge,</i>

224

227
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,440
<i>America's Drunkest Nobody,</i>
<i>Let's Make a Veal...</i>

228
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,316
Love that show.

229
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,612
<i>Somali Pirate Apprentice.</i>

230
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,065
Right, yeah,
with those guys.

231
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,034
<i>Fix Andy Dick.</i>

232
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,324
It's about time.

235
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,248
and <i>Grave Robbers</i>
<i>of Orange County.</i>

236
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,999
Geez, that's, uh,
quite a list.

237
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,541
Hang on.
I'm getting a text.

238
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,634
Ooh, those were all
just canceled,

239
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,919
except for <i>American Idol.</i>

240
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,302
Did you just say
<i>"Armenian Idol"?</i>

241
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,338
'Cause that's my favorite show!

242
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,171
No, no, no, no, no,
<i>American Idol.</i>

243
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,296
Oh, yeah.

244
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,932
Who's their Egor Glumov?

245
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:53,969
Randy Jackson.

246
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,471
Ah, good enough.

247
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,864
Uh, hey, driver,
could you put on a song

248
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,729
about California
or Los Angeles?

249
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,226
Ah, they all suck.

250
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,188
But here's a great one
about Alabama!

251
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:17,488
<i>♪ Sweet home Alabama ♪</i>

252
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:21,695

00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:26,627
<i>♪ Sweet home Alabama ♪</i>

<i>♪ Lord, I'm coming home</i>
<i>to you. ♪</i>

255
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,061
Now that I have
all this free time,

256
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,968
I thought I would do you
a huge favor.

257
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,217
That's nice.

258
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,428
What kind of favor?

259
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,517
I organized
the kitchen.

260
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,443
I labeled everything
with a label maker...

261
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:53,152
and I mixed all the spices
together into one super spice!

262
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,145
(meows)

263
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,357
(gasps)

264
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,487
(labored breathing)

265
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,163
Oh-oh, what kind
of ventilating is that?

266
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,992
Hyper!

267
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,167
(fans cheering)

268
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,168
(player grunts)

269
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,919
(siren wails)

270
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,251
Wow, Marge,

271
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,206
I can't believe you're
taking me to a sports bar.

272
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:17,217
Well, it's been such a blessing
having you around the house.

273
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,181
Making my life easier,
as you so put it.

274
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,472
So I thought you
deserved a reward.

275
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,056
(tires screech)

276
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,021
(fans cheering)

277
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,232
-(laughing)
-(zapping, groans)

278
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,979
Watching hockey.

279
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,027
Watching them
pass that puck.

280
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,201
Oh, yeah.

281
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,108
Lacrosse, idiot.

282
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,987
Hey, man, can you
settle a bet?

283
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,985
What was the
greatest XFL team

284
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,997
that never won
a championship?

285
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,959
Uh, the Long Island
Iced Teas?

286
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,170
I think you want the gay bar
across the street.

287
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:54,171
(house music playing)

288
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,835
As an eight-year-old girl
in 21st-century America,

289
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,965
I know how it is to feel
insecure about your looks.

290
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,643
But you've got so much
going for you.

291
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,853
I'd kill for your
sense of smell.

292
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,523
You have a nice firm handshake.

293
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:11,311
And when you wag your tail,
it really lights up a room.

294
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,267
Now let's scoot together.

295
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,581
Wow, I can't believe I'm here.

296
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,118
The place where magic is made.

297
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,872
(chuckles)

298
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,374
I really appreciate you
showing me around, Simon.

299
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,167
Always happy to
help the newbies.

300
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,250
And how do you like L.A.?

301
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,884
Oh, it's a helluva city.

302
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,841
It's like somebody
stepped on New York

303
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,341
and scraped it off
on the beach.

304
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,173
Clever.

305
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,297
Slightly nasty.

306
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,473
Very impressive.

307
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,431
You know, I don't say
this often, Moe,

308
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,641
but I actually think you're
quite good at this.

309
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,892
(chuckles)

310
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,733
Oh, well... Oh, nuts.

311
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,099
Here come the paparazzi.

312
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,476
Hey. Ah. Ugh. Oh.

313
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,777
Homie, I thought you
were at that sports bar.

314
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,946
Well, that place was for
die-hard sports fans.

315
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,446
Not guys like me, who are

316
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,827
only fans when their team
makes the play offs.

317
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:14,245
So I decided to take
apart the washing machine

318
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,585
to see where that penny
I left in my pants went.

319
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,720
Well, I am glad you're
spending more time with us,

320
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,339
but maybe you should get a
plumber to help you with that.

321
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,136
Oh, those guys
are all crooks.

322
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,760
They charge you for
parts and labor?

323
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:27,967
Pick one, buddy.

324
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,637
I can do this
just fine by myself.

325
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,386
(grunts)

326
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,848
Don't worry, I got it.

327
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,148
(grunting)

328
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:40,645
(sighs)

329
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,451
(mutters)

330
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,744
Sure is hell to have
your husband around all
the time, ain't it?

331
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,657
At least in hell,
the heat still works.

332
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:54,996
Well, I do know something
that could occupy his time.

333
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,634
A lot of his time.

334
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,630
Seen it work with plenty
of men my age.

335
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,843
Only thing is,
you may not get him back.

336
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:03,925
What is it?

337
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,799
(ominous voice):
Golf.

338
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,136
(muffled grunting)

339
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,432
Hey there, neighbor.

340
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,176
You look as puffed up
as a peacock in a...

341
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,728
(shouting)

342
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,278
Golf it is.

343
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,818
Golf what is?

344
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,315
Uh, you wanted
to see me, Simon?

345
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,736
Moe, as you know,

346
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,034
over the past few days I've
grown rather fond of you.

347
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,788
I can't believe you gave
me your home phone number.

348
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,211
That's not my home number.

349
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,619
That's my assistant's
work number.

350
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,128
Now, Moe, I want to give you
a friendly warning--

351
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,170
don't do what I did.

352
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,344
Don't become the mean judge.

353
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,433
But it's brought you everything
a man could want.

354
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,638
Uh, I bet you throw out
your paper plates

355
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,639
instead of reusing them
till the food drops through.

356
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,511
That's true. Everything
you said is true.

357
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,518
But there's a cost.

358
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,769
I'm lonely, Moe.

359
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,600
No one dares to be my friend,

360
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,145
for fear I'll say
something nasty.

361
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,308
But what we do is just
kiddin' around, right?

362
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,817
People know that.

363
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,029
Do they?

364
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,648
They've been preparing
a bio of you,

365
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,185
with interviews of
people you've judged.

366
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,398
Let's have a look.

367
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,277
He's the meanest
man in town.

368
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,664
Nasty.

369
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,871
Uncouth.

370
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,700
ALL:
We hate you.

371
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,075
So does Stu.

372
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,002
Edit that so it
rhymes with something.

373
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:20,421
He's a... (bleeps)

374
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,882
Wow, I can't believe
this, Simon.

375
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,133
Simon?

376
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,674
Huh.

377
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,178
Was he really here, or was it
just my imagination?

378
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,010
I'm here.

379
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,434
My black tee shirt makes me
blend into the shadows.

380
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,143
I'm here, I'm gone.

381
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:36,273
I'm here, I'm gone.
I'm here, I'm gone.

382
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,102
-I'm here.
-I get it. I get it.
That-That's your thing.

383
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:49,700
♪ Happy birthday to... ♪

384
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,032
(high note):
♪ You! ♪

385
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,037
(cheering and applause)

386
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,750
This is it, Moe--

387
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,210
America's going to learn
just what sort of man you are.

388
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,052
Okay, Randy, what'd you
think of that performance?

389
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,708
A'ight, a'ight, you know what?

390
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,297
I was feelin' that, dawg.

391
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,512
"Happy" was very cool, right?

392
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,341
But "birth" was definitely
a little pitchy.

393
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,096
But I gotta tell you something,
you worked it out on "day," man.

394
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,349
And then when you hit that "to
you", dude, that was the bomb.

395
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,232
You blew out
all the candles, baby.

396
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,729
If you think that
answer was a yes,

397
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,862
{\an8}text the number at
the bottom of the screen.

398
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,899
{\an8}Giant secret charges
may apply. Kara?

399
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,153
I have to admit, I didn't think
you could come back

400
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,355
from last week, when your
version of "Brown Sugar"

401
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,405
made Mick Jagger
retire from singing forever.

402
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,029
But you rocked it.

403
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,156
Ellen, what's your
"ramble" on this?

404
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,003
Ryan, I don't ramble anymore.

405
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,868
Although I do love that
song "Ramblin' Man" by
The Allman Brothers.

406
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,706
I used to think that they were
"The Almond Brothers,"

407
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,331
which was cool,
because I love nuts.

408
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,168
Except for filberts,
which is weird

409
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,593
because I love Dilbert--

410
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,461
'cause when you're stuck
working in a cubicle,

411
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,798
sometimes you just gotta dance.

412
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,803
(cheering)

413
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,229
Now let's hear from
the new guy, Moe Szyslak.

414
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,732
(crowd murmuring)

415
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,895
Uh... Well, let's
see here, um....

416
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,445
Don't become the mean judge.

417
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,951
Mr. Cowell, would you
like some band candy?

418
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,044
Security.

419
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,001
Uh, I'm afraid

420
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,131
you're wasting your
time on this stage.

421
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,748
(laughing and hooting)

422
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,416
...because you should be
on Broadway

423
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,255
chargin' a hundred
bucks a ticket.

424
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,680
You're a natural talent.

425
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,969
(giggles)

426
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,552
I'm gettin' a
little emotional here,

427
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,056
because your voice, it opened
up a little part of me

428
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,269
that I thought was closed
to truth and beauty forever.

429
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,480
If there's a God,
I just hope that right now

430
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,561
he's votin' your name
on that 8-8-8 line.

431
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,017
(voice breaking):
It was, it was really beautiful.

432
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,487
Really. Thank you.

433
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,988
Okay, that's four thumbs up.

434
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,701
And finally, because this
show now has more judges

435
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,412
than the Supreme Court...
Simon, what do you say?

436
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,703
Well, that was a truly a
remarkable version of
"Happy Birthday."

437
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,207
Because when it was done,

438
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,288
I actually felt like I had
lost a year of my life.

439
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,214
(audience laughing and hooting)

440
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:10,463
But even more objectionable
were Moe's insipid comments,

441
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,757
a desperate plea
for affection,

442
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,931
which fell as flat as
the hair on my head.

443
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,564
(laughter)

444
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,640
Why are you raggin' on me?

445
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,524
I'm just doin'
what you said.

446
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,891
Hmm. Let me think.

447
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,267
Why would I try to
sabotage a new judge

448
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,225
who just might do what I
do for $48 million less?

449
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,316
Hey, hey, hey.

450
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,820
I've been double-crossed here.

451
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,742
You're pretty smart huh, Simon?

452
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,661
Let's see how smart you are with
your voice box hangin' out.

453
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,700
(grunts)

454
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,413
Label to camera.
Label to camera.

455
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,413
What? Oh. Sorry. Sorry.

456
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,655
Die, ya bastard.

457
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,378
Tees, scorecard,
stubby little pencil.

458
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,499
You're all set.

459
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,295
Have fun, Homie.

460
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,589
Looks like Jimmy's

461
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,552
starting him off
with a three iron.

462
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,972
My first shot was
with a three iron.

463
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,681
One shot, and I was
hooked for life.

464
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,061
Barely saw my family again.

465
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,559
Birthdays, anniversaries,
I missed 'em all.

466
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,024
I'm missing my daughter's
wedding right now.

467
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,645
Sweet guy, I'm told.

468
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,942
One shot.

469
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,185
Hooked for life.

470
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,865
(shrieks)

471
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,448
Huh?!

472
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,953
Marge, you ruined my shot.

473
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:25,155
You can take another,
in 40 years.

474
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,377
That was awesome.

475
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,050
I feel like the
Tiger Woods of sex.

476
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,630
In the mood for
another round?

477
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,256
(giggling)

478
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,764
I didn't rip out
his voice box,

479
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,017
but I did stretch out
his tee shirt.

480
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,849
Then they said I ain't allowed
back in California no more

481
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,305
and I can no longer make
judgments about nothin'.

482
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:52,646
Hey, Moe, am I
okay to drive?

483
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,153
Legally, I can't say.

484
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,744
To a drunk man,
that's a yes.

485
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,865
(imitating car engine)

486
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,041
Beep, beep.

487
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,409
He seems fine.

488
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,825
There is one bright side:

489
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,334
I'm also forbidden
from ever watching Fox.

490
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,246
You can't even show it
in the bar?

491
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,295
That's right, and business
has never been better.

492
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,839
(patrons clamoring)

493
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:21,465
Oh, hey, how's it
goin' there, Mr. Murdoch?

494
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,433
Never mind me-- put on
<i>The Jay Leno Show.</i>

495
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,064
<i>Have you seen this?</i>

496
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,601
<i>The president says</i>
<i>Iran has gotten ahold</i>

497
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,475
<i>of the most dangerous weapon</i>
<i>known to man:</i>

498
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,812
The BP oil rig.

499
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,977
That's right,
ladies and gentlemen.

500
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,935
But I know how to make
that leak disappear:

501
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,145
put it on NBC.

502
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,235
(laughing)

503
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,660
(theme song playing)

504
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,157
(laughing)
