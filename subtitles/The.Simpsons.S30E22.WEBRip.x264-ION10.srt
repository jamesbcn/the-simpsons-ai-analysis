1
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:06,474
Let go, let go.

2
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:43,711
This is Dateline, Springfield.

3
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,222
From a distance, the Simpsons
were the perfect family.

4
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:57,024
Homer and Marge were
high school sweethearts.

5
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,560
She saved me
from a dateless prom.

6
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:02,096
He saved me from a life
with my sisters.

7
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,866
Those two are monsters.
Cut to them, you'll see.

8
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,102
What are you filming us for?

9
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:12,072
Marge and Homer raised
their three kids

10
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:14,108
in an atmosphere
of love, laughter

11
00:01:14,142 --> 00:01:16,110
and crushing
economic anxiety.

12
00:01:16,144 --> 00:01:18,879
The only thing they needed
was each other.

13
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,082
When I first met the Simpsons,
in 1947,

14
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:25,819
they were building affordable
homes in Pennsylvania.

15
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:29,223
Little Maggie was going to be
the next Lindbergh baby.

16
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:33,627
But John Foster Dulles
had other ideas.

17
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:35,095
Don't interview Grampa.

18
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:38,232
He almost made Ken Burns
quit the business.

19
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:43,437
That pompous old fool
was more boring than baseball.

20
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:46,274
Little did the Simpsons suspect
that their American dream

21
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:48,909
was about to be flipped
upside down

22
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,645
by the spatula of crime.

23
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:54,648
Home to a nuclear power plant
and an active volcano,

24
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:57,318
Springfield seemed like
the safest place in the world.

25
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:01,922
But that tranquility
was about to be shattered,

26
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,357
in a mysterious crime

27
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,959
that would tear
the Simpson family apart.

28
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,962
Tear us apart?
Nothing can tear us apart.

29
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:10,464
Tear us apart.

30
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:12,866
Mom, stop saying
tear us apart.

31
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,868
It's tearing us apart!

32
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:17,171
Who wants mac and cheese?

33
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:20,174
Our conscienceless reenactment
begins as Marge and Lisa

34
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,376
return home from a trip
to the market.

35
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,144
Whatever we didn't spend,
I'd donate

36
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:28,048
to Lisa's secret college fund.

37
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,219
We hid it in the last place
the men in this family would look.

38
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:33,354
A jar of cleanser.

39
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:36,357
What happened next was one
of those life-changing moments

40
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,293
that always seem to happen
under the sink.

41
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:44,565
The entire college fund,
$670.42, was gone.

42
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,700
And just like that,
Lisa's dream

43
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,536
of going to college
for three weeks,

44
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,071
without a food plan,
was over.

45
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,806
For any parent
of young children,

46
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,010
the thing you dread most
is losing a can full of money.

47
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,741
Chief, you found something?

48
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:31,779
Zero evidence of Pringles,
so...

49
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:35,048
So we were back at square one.

50
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,450
It was not
your typical break-in.

51
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:38,185
No sign of forced entry.

52
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,187
I mean,
the dog didn't even bark.

53
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,057
Somebody knew exactly
where to rub him. The tummy.

54
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,397
A police reenactment confirmed
the chief's theory.

55
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,365
Oh, oh, God, that's great.

56
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:53,133
Oh, there's no way I'm barking.

57
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,869
Oh, Lou, you got to teach
my wife to do this.

58
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,138
With zero evidence
of a break-in,

59
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,874
police suspicion
turned to the family.

60
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,444
This just didn't pass what cops
call the smell test.

61
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,946
I've watched a lot
of cop shows in my day.

62
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,948
I consider myself something
of an amateur policeman.

63
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,320
Let me just stop this
documentary, or doc,

64
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,121
here and now!

65
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:16,223
We are good people.

66
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,327
We do not steal.

67
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,894
That's borrowing.

68
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:25,999
Borrowing. Borr-ow-ing.

69
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:30,070
And so this nuclear family
began to explode,

70
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,840
as suspicion focused
on one man.

71
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,909
Oh, what about the important
clue the police missed?

72
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,912
Somebody set a drink down here
without a coaster.

73
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,981
That had to be a stranger.

74
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,616
This is an expensive table,

75
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,153
and my family knows
I don't want it stained.

76
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:50,958
Springfield detectives made

77
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:53,293
a desperate plea
to the public for help.

78
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:55,463
They didn't have to wait long.

79
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,698
Nelson came to school today

80
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,199
with a salon-quality haircut.

81
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,936
His family doesn't even have
money for milk.

82
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,138
He eats cereal with rain water.

83
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,307
Mr. Teeny stole the money,

84
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:09,309
like he steals all my scenes.

85
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:12,145
I swear it on my very bone.

86
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,815
Sincerely, anonymous caller.

87
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,551
But just as you're about
to give up after two calls,

88
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:19,987
you hit pay dirt.

89
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,155
I would like to accuse
Marge Simpson

90
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,625
of stealing that money to feed
her gambling habit.

91
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,494
She told my husband,
the minister,

92
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:27,895
that she was an addict.

93
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,963
In confidence, but, you know.

94
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:37,538
Marge Simpson.
This suburban mother

95
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,339
with Olive Oyl good looks

96
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:43,043
had kicked her gambling habit
years ago. Or had she?

97
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,312
I admit it. I couldn't
resist the temptation.

98
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,080
But then I did.

99
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:49,182
Marge walked out of the casino

100
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,851
and off the suspect list.

101
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,820
Shockingly, the mystery
would not be solved

102
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,888
in the first five minutes
of the show.

103
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:57,357
With Marge's name cleared,
the police moved

104
00:05:57,391 --> 00:06:00,694
to the next suspect
on their list, Homer Simpson.

105
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:03,030
Homer's bar tab was spiraling
out of control.

106
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,565
Five, six hundred bucks.

107
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,934
That night, Moe cut him off.

108
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,944
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

109
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,947
Yeah, our theory was that Homer
came home wasted, he fell,

110
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,716
he shimmied and he found
the money under the sink there,

111
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,686
and he figured he'd just
use it to pay his tab.

112
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,121
Well it's indisputable
that Homer visited the kitchen

113
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,690
before going to bed.

114
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,460
You see, we found
spaghetti sauce splatter

115
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:35,262
consistent with a very violent
late-night snack.

116
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:39,467
This is, ah, this is not
a flayvin situation.

117
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,236
Although, I still am compelled
to say flayvin.

118
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,072
Sauce on the walls,
the ceiling,

119
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,040
under Homer's fingernails.

120
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,376
That pasta fought hard
for its life.

121
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,979
What that man did
to those leftovers...

122
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,448
I'm sorry, I can't continue.

123
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:56,817
But if the kitchen had been
a tomato-soaked abattoir

124
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,053
that night, why had no one
noticed in the morning?

125
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,991
He cleaned up the kitchen
after stuffing

126
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,993
all the money into his pockets,

127
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,462
so we just had to
get those pants.

128
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:11,164
Fortunately,
a simple sting did the trick.

129
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,102
Ooh, Super Bowl in July!

130
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,910
No money in these pants.

131
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,446
All we find is candy-coated
peanuts, popcorn and a prize.

132
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,749
Now, that's some Cracker Jack
detective work.

133
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,485
Get it? Cracker Jack?

134
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,986
Yeah. Yeah.

135
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,255
But as for evidence,
we got nothing.

136
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,024
With Homer
still the prime suspect,

137
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,259
and the investigation stalled,

138
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,029
Deadline Springfield
was in dire straits.

139
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:45,465
The show desperately needed
a cliffhanger commercial break.

140
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,367
What if the real
criminal mastermind

141
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,804
was billionaire
Montgomery Burns?

142
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:53,373
Why would I steal $600?

143
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,876
That's nothing to me.

144
00:07:55,909 --> 00:08:00,313
This is what rich is. Smithers,
bring me some more money.

145
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:02,382
Need more convincing?

146
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,985
No. We'll be right back.

147
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,158
Police returned
to their first theory.

148
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,192
Could Homer Simpson
have done it?

149
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,027
Oh, definitely.
Hey, you're gonna distort

150
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,829
my voice for this, right?

151
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,130
'Cause I don't want
no one knowing

152
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,532
that this is Moe Szyslak here.

153
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:20,801
Oh, and cut the name too, yeah?

154
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:24,972
As Moe Szyslak said,
Homer was definitely a suspect.

155
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,041
It was pretty clear, Chief liked
Homer Simpson for this case.

156
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:31,845
Well, geez, Lou, I wouldn't say
that I liked-liked him.

157
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,548
I just, why,
did he say something about me?

158
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,650
I mean you thought he was
a person of interest.

159
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:39,186
Shut up. I can find
someone interest-ing

160
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:43,490
without being interest-ed
in them. Shut up.

161
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,025
Yeah, but then
new evidence came in

162
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:46,594
that apparently cleared Homer.

163
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:49,663
Phone records showed a six-hour
call from Homer's phone

164
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:52,032
to a third party
on the night of the crime.

165
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,568
The DNA revealed
that it was a butt dial.

166
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:57,170
Yeah, and not just to someone
on his speed dial list.

167
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:01,074
His dexterous cheeks
dialed all ten digits.

168
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,213
Disco Stu is unavailable
for you.

169
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:09,049
At the beep,
you know what to do.

170
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,051
When police played back
Homer's message,

171
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:14,121
it revealed a horrifying truth.

172
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,522
Homer didn't scrub
the spaghetti sauce

173
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,457
off that kitchen with cleanser.

174
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,628
The sick bastard licked
those walls clean.

175
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,034
He had a little help.

176
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:36,744
My first thought was
to delete the message, sure,

177
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:40,748
but then I started grooving
to that slurping safari.

178
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:44,551
I hadn't heard any other music
than disco in so long.

179
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:49,657
Sometimes, a persona can just...
it becomes a trap, you know?

180
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,826
I knew it couldn't be Homer.
Every Simpson is innocent.

181
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,628
Until proven guilty.

182
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:56,930
No. Just innocent.

183
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:59,499
What are you doing? Stop
panning across the family.

184
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,301
They didn't do it.

185
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:05,072
Finally.
I've been expecting you.

186
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,643
Like any normal healthy boy,
Bart has been the focus

187
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:12,079
of numerous
police investigations.

188
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,614
But a mother knows
when her son is innocent.

189
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,283
And when she's kidding herself,

190
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,285
and when she's turning
a blind eye.

191
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,120
This time he's innocent.

192
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,855
Just ask his friends.

193
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:25,292
- State your name for the record.
- Bart Simpson took the money.

194
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,661
I admit I knew about
the money under the sink,

195
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:30,463
but whatever I borrowed,
I always put back.

196
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,432
Also, $600?

197
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,669
What would a ten-year-old boy
do with that much money?

198
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:38,138
Slime.
Bart was buying slime.

199
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,507
I've never seen such
a cooperative witness.

200
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,343
I brought extra batteries
for your tape recorder too.

201
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,879
Slime. The gooey, harmless

202
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:49,182
plaything wildly popular
with kids today.

203
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:55,488
I'd seen all the fads,
yo-yos, pogs, Pokémon, crunking,

204
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:58,058
the short stories
of John Cheever.

205
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,027
But this beat them all.

206
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,095
<i>On a clear day</i>

207
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:06,834
<i>Rise and look around</i>

208
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:09,502
<i>You</i>

209
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:13,340
<i>And you will see who</i>

210
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,179
<i>You are</i>

211
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:36,063
My plan was, if I owned all
the slime, I'd set the price,

212
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,631
except that's when
the bottom fell out.

213
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,174
Lucky for me, there was
one gullible schlub

214
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,176
who didn't realize
the craze was over.

215
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,111
I sold my entire stash to him.

216
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:54,714
I have not agreed to be
in your documentary.

217
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:56,950
Please go.

218
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:59,119
So I put the money back
I had borrowed

219
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,221
from under the sink,
and I filmed it

220
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,623
because I knew no one
would believe me.

221
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,026
So that's everyone
in the Simpson family,

222
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,196
except for Lisa, of course.
It couldn't be her, right?

223
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,631
Nah. Well, let's look at the...

224
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,200
Oh, for God's sake.

225
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,969
I asked Lisa where she was
when the money was stolen

226
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:20,273
and she said, chillin'.
You know, maxin' and relaxin'.

227
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:23,143
Now these are the words
of a very cool person,

228
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,813
but Lisa Simpson is not even
a little cool.

229
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,614
So...

230
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,082
Oh, come on.

231
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:33,086
No one, I repeat no one,
would believe Lisa could do it.

232
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,289
But she's also a girl
who wants a new saxophone.

233
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:37,690
I'm just saying.

234
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,730
I've been Lisa's supplier
for years.

235
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,066
Reeds, wipes, valve grease.

236
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,235
Would she commit a crime
over a new sax?

237
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,238
Did Dave Brubeck
compose in 9/8 time?

238
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,606
He did. We'll count
it out together.

239
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:09,957
Go ahead, give it a spin.

240
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:31,711
Oh, it's the best bari sax
on the market,

241
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:34,647
a Smoothphone Jazzhonker
in black nickel.

242
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:38,051
But I wouldn't steal for it.

243
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:40,120
When we come back, Lisa did it.

244
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,023
- No, I didn't.
- Lisa, it's your bedtime.

245
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:46,326
I got to go. My mom's reading me
Harry Potter book four.

246
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,695
Oh, yeah, the one
where Cedric Diggory dies?

247
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,230
- You suck.
- You did it!

248
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,099
No, you did it, jerk.

249
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:58,405
Okay, okay. Time's up.

250
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:02,175
The reed's mine.

251
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:04,544
You can't spell greed
without reed.

252
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:05,845
Check it out.

253
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:11,885
Why did we agree
to do this documentary?

254
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,921
Because all our
biggest stars today

255
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,989
come from true crime
documentaries.

256
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,158
The Jinx, Making a Murderer,

257
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,827
and Matt Lauer
on the Today Show.

258
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,931
It turns out Lisa
did not buy the new saxophone.

259
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,432
Someone else did.

260
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,335
I've always wanted
to play bari sax,

261
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:32,439
but my father insisted on tenor.

262
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:35,075
In you go.

263
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,748
- What do you think of this?
- You're still a disappointment.

264
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,418
But if Lisa was innocent,

265
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:48,755
why was she so reluctant
to explain her whereabouts

266
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,257
at the time of the crime?

267
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,693
Shut up about my Lisa!
I can tell you where she was.

268
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,228
- She was...
- Bup, bup, bup, bup!

269
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,230
Mom! Mom! No!

270
00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:59,566
Apparently, some of the girls
at school were...

271
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:02,735
Let's just say I stole the
money, okay? End of documentary.

272
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,737
See you at the
Independent Spirit Awards.

273
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,274
I took her to her
hopscotch tutor.

274
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,542
I was hanging on by a thread,

275
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,945
and now the whole world
will joke about

276
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:16,883
how I am the only girl who
ever needed a hopscotch tutor.

277
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,818
Lisa, just repeat after me.

278
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,221
One foot, two foot, one foot,
one foot, two foot, one foot,

279
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,455
two foot, one foot...

280
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:26,059
So stupid.
Who invented this game?

281
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:29,896
The Scotch invented hopscotch
and Scotch tape!

282
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,932
- What about scotch whiskey?
- Never heard of it.

283
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:35,635
See, I told you, all innocent.

284
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,605
So maybe now you vultures
can leave us be.

285
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,340
We've taken up
enough of your time.

286
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:41,574
Let's go, guys.

287
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,417
What are you doing?
My family's in the clear.

288
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,653
I want you to apologize
to my wife!

289
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,489
Apologize? Us?

290
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,525
Oh, you will, and you know why?

291
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:03,130
I am the last person
that watches network television,

292
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:06,633
including the commercials.

293
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,536
I apologize.

294
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,038
Now promise that this scene

295
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,839
will not be removed in editing.

296
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:15,508
I can't promise that,
only the editor can.

297
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,510
- I got him.
- I'm gonna report you

298
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,979
to the American Cinema Editors.

299
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:22,149
It's just
an honorary society.

300
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,517
You take that back!

301
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,123
What a relief.
So who did do it?

302
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,959
It was obviously Bart.
It's always Bart.

303
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,895
Hey, nothing is my fault
'cause Dad raised me so rotten.

304
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,965
Well, nothing is my fault 'cause
my dad raised me so rotten.

305
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,201
Don't blame me.

306
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:44,003
It was a race out the door
and your mother won.

307
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:45,805
- Oh, yeah?
- It was Bart!

308
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,176
Goes to show
how irresponsible you are!

309
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,178
Shut up,
all you innocent people.

310
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,012
I wish I was
never responsible for you.

311
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:54,747
Stop it, stop it!

312
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:57,016
You're tearing
this family apart.

313
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,819
And stop calling
the sofa a love seat!

314
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,588
I barely like it!

315
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,824
The great Simpson Robbery
remains unsolved.

316
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,026
Justice may never be served,

317
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,029
but at the end of the day,
what matters is that we enjoyed

318
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:11,998
watching bad things
happen to human beings

319
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,400
who aren't us.

320
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,069
Help, Mother.

321
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,576
You try not to dwell

322
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,178
on your innumerable failures.

323
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:28,047
Instead, you stare out to sea
and try to look like

324
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:30,083
you're thinking deep thoughts.

325
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:32,018
Just like this.

326
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,287
Yeah.

327
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:35,588
You got what you need?

328
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:37,724
'Cause I got an itch,
I got to scratch it.

329
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,963
Now let's celebrate.

330
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,798
We got through a documentary
looking better

331
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,066
than before it started.

332
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,669
Nobody's done that
since André the Giant.

333
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,973
Homer Simpson,
you'll leave a ring.

334
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:57,043
Ta-da! A snap-on coaster.

335
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,378
Nifty, huh?

336
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,213
What the...?
Where'd you get this thing?

337
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,715
I invented it.

338
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,318
How many of these things
did you have made?

339
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:08,255
A thousand. I wanted to
start a business.

340
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:12,392
A thousand, huh?
That must've been expensive.

341
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:16,163
That's what I thought,
but it was only 65 cents apiece.

342
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:19,999
So 650 bucks total?

343
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,135
When did you get so good
at your timeses?

344
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:25,972
It was you, but
the whole time you denied it.

345
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:27,740
It was always you!

346
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,910
I can explain.

347
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,912
No! No explanation.

348
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,447
Kids, get in here!

349
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:37,684
For once in this marriage,
you did the wrong thing.

350
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,519
I am going to savor this.

351
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:44,257
I am gonna wait until I do
something wrong, and then...

352
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,758
Okay, we're even.

353
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,960
Well, let me just explain why.

354
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:51,164
Every day, you go out
to your friends, to Moe's.

355
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:53,132
Life to you is an adventure.

356
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,968
And I had an idea,
an idea for something

357
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:58,505
that might make me somebody.

358
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:01,341
But I admit it,
I was gambling,

359
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,975
on myself.

360
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,378
I understand, honey.

361
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:08,315
I completely understand.

362
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,720
- What's going on?
- Well, Lisa,

363
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,556
- I'm afraid I have to say...
- Lisa, I just want you to know

364
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:20,727
your mother's about to say that
the money was eaten by rats.

365
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,330
- But...
- How did rats get inside the can?

366
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,465
Grampa left it open.

367
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:29,035
Oh, why do they blame
everything around here on me?

368
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,170
Oh, good, the cat's done.

369
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:35,141
Marge, I'd like to take a walk
with the greatest woman ever.

370
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:40,580
From that moment on, Homer
and I had never been closer.

371
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,015
We shared a dark secret.

372
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,017
It was so sexy.

373
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:49,021
Marge, I have a secret too.

374
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,891
I'm losing my hair.

375
00:19:56,364 --> 00:19:59,232
The Great Simpson Robbery
remains unsol...

376
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,734
Wait, what do you
mean unsolved?

377
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,936
What the hell is this?

378
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,839
My public expects me
to solve the mystery, Bob.

379
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,842
It's not like we can just change
the format of the show.

380
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,778
You just read the copy.

381
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:14,013
Our viewers want one thing,
it's simple.

382
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,749
Solve the freakin' crime,
be told who did it.

383
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:18,851
And I am the soothing voice,

384
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,620
the reassuring voice that...

385
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,221
Did you hear that?
Oh, my God,

386
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:25,191
I snapped my right vocal cord,
that's the dulcet one.

387
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,594
Quick! Prep him
for cord transplant.

388
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,030
We don't have a human donor.

389
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,333
All we have is the vocal cord
of a sheep.

390
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:39,606
And I'm ba-a-ack.

391
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:42,942
He has an unbelievable work
ethic for a voice-over actor.
