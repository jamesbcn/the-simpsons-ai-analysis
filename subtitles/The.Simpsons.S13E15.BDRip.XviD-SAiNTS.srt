1
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:07,048
The Simpsons

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,427
D'oh!

3
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,987
The Itchy
and Scratchy Show!

4
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:35,410
Tee one up
for me, catty.

5
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,286
Sure thing, mousy.

6
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,044
Nice follow-through!

7
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:49,507
Now that's what I call
a moon shot.

8
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,850
Now that's what I call
a moon shot.

9
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,727
Dad, that line was
in the cartoon.

10
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,311
I'm pretty sure it wasn't.

11
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:07,734
Our phone bill is $400!
They charged us
for a call to Brazil.

12
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,235
Boy, did you make
a prank call to Brazil?

13
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,403
No, sir. I didn't.

14
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,280
Choke on your lies!

15
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:18,369
Homer, they must've
made a mistake.

16
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:21,914
We'll just go down
to the phone company
and straighten it out.

17
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:25,001
Which phone company?
There are hundreds of them.

18
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,211
And they all keep
changing their names.

19
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,965
I think
we're with Comquaaq.

20
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,759
No,
I think its Niagular.

21
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,470
No, last week they
became Vertiqual.

22
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:47,231
Wow.
Everything is so high-tech.

23
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:50,359
Dialing Murray Hill,
5-6-3-0-9.

24
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,529
So, I says to Myrna,
I says, "That guy's a bum!"

25
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:58,493
Ooh! That's the
Movie Phone guy.

26
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:01,037
The movie we've selected
plays at 8:00 p. m.

27
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,623
at Springfield Cinema Six.

28
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,792
Thank you for dating
Mr. Movie Phone.

29
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:09,086
Our evening
will be rated R,
for brief nudity.

30
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,421
Ma'am, would you
be interested in

31
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,423
changing your
long-distance service if...

32
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,300
What the...

33
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,595
She hung up on me!
What did I do?

34
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,769
Hello. I'm your
customer service rep,
Lindsay Naegle.

35
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,813
We've met you many times,
Miss Naegle.

36
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,648
Why do you keep
changing jobs?

37
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:29,941
I'm a sexual predator.

38
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,025
Oh.

39
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,319
Now, how may I best
dispense with you today?

40
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,531
We've been charged
for calls to Brazil
that we didn't make.

41
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:39,033
We are not
paying this bill.

42
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,452
Fine.
I'll cut off your service.

43
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,497
Fine!
I'll cut off your ponytail!
Homer!

44
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,874
Marge,
it's called negotiating.

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,963
Ooh. Fascinating.

46
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,259
I need to call Janie,
but I can't get a dial tone.

47
00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:00,179
We're not paying our bill,
so the phone company
shut off our service.

48
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:02,974
Why must you fight
with every utility?

49
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:07,520
I told you,
I have too much
time on my hands.

50
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:11,107
Homer.
We were cleaning out
a cooling duct at the plant

51
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,276
and found a box
of old taco shells.

52
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,862
Oh, why didn't you call me?

53
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,864
We tried,
but a recording said

54
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,449
you were
a bunch of deadbeats. Mmm.

55
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:25,997
That's it!
They have awoken
a sleeping giant.

56
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,708
Homer,
what are you going to do?

57
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,543
Crazy scheme,
crazy scheme,
crazy scheme.

58
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,129
Get me tools and beer!
Yes!

59
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,841
Free service,
here we come.

60
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,552
All right.
Let's try the red one.

61
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,307
Okay. I'll try the green.

62
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,897
Let's try the red one again.
Oh, not again!

63
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,735
Let's try them together.

64
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,700
Maybe the red one.

65
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,416
How did I get here?

66
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,251
We found you
smoldering in the bushes.

67
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:16,380
That's it!
We're just going to have to
pay for that call to Brazil!

68
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,965
What call to Brazil?

69
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,217
The one I didn't make
and Marge didn't make

70
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,137
and Bart didn't make
and hence, no one
in the house made.

71
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,430
Uh-oh.

72
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,557
You made that call?

73
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,434
But you're the good one.

74
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,394
Yeah. The one we both like.

75
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,854
Why did you do it?

76
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,397
Please don't be mad.

77
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,317
I've been sponsoring
an orphan boy in Brazil.

78
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:42,114
Oh, aren't you sweet?
Sharing your allowance
with a poor Brazilian boy.

79
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,076
Don't you know
the boys from Brazil
are little Hitlers?

80
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,788
I saw it in a movie,
whose name I can't remember!

81
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,957
Ronaldo used to
send me a letter
every month,

82
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,458
but then they stopped.

83
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,711
That's why
I called the orphanage.
But they said he disappeared.

84
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,673
How come you talked
for $400?

85
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:02,051
Well, then they
started pressuring me
for more donations,

86
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,387
and you can't
hang up on a nun.

87
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,974
That's right.
They have powers.

88
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,810
When I sent my
first donation,

89
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,561
the charity mailed me
this video.

90
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,651
Hi, Lisa.
Thank you for your donation.

91
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,654
Because of your generosity,
I bought sturdy shoes

92
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,365
that will last for
a thousand sambas!

93
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,161
Aw!

94
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:33,124
He's so adorable.
Can we have another baby?

95
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,669
No way! I still haven't
lost the weight I put on
from the last one.

96
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,881
And with the money left over,
the orphanage was able
to buy a door.

97
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,342
Now the monkeys
cannot bite me.

98
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:44,593
Uh-oh.

99
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,768
I am like sugar to them.

100
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,104
Oh.

101
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,524
That poor little boy.
We've got to find him.

102
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,234
How many people
live in Brazil?

103
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,653
A hundred and
fifty-six million.
D'oh!

104
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,197
Well, we've got to find him!

105
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,034
What? I'm really concerned.

106
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,203
Fine.
I want to meet monkeys.

107
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:14,874
I don't know.
It's awfully expensive
to fly to Brazil.

108
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,209
Not if we buy our
tickets on the Internet.

109
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,836
It's really cheap
if we change planes

110
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,255
in Phoenix,
Honolulu, Sun City
and East Saint Louis,

111
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,050
spend a night
in a haunted house
and leave right now.

112
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,720
Then it's settled.
The Simpsons are
going to Brazil!

113
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,722
And I'll have been
on every continent.

114
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,432
Except Antarctica.

115
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:36,812
The Simpsons are
going to Antarctica
next year. This year, Brazil.

116
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,528
Okay,
here are some travel tips.

117
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,238
"Only drink bottled water.

118
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,657
"Don't get into
an unlicensed taxi.

119
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,911
"And remember,
they have winter
during our summer. "

120
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:55,456
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
So, in August, it's cold?

121
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:59,001
That's right.
And in February, it's hot?

122
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,086
Mmm-hmm.

123
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:05,424
So, it's opposite land!
Crooks chase cops,
cats have puppies.

124
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,343
No, Dad.
It's just the weather.

125
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,220
So, hot snow falls up?

126
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,514
Yes.
Woo-hoo!

127
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,105
Get ready, Brazil.
I now speak fluent Spanish.

128
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:24,068
Well done, Bart.
But in Brazil,
they speak Portuguese.

129
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,615
Forget every word, boy.
It's useless.

130
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,284
But, Homer...
I said forget it!

131
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,289
All gone.

132
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,917
This is your
captain speaking.

133
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,919
The local temperature
in Rio de Janeiro

134
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,798
is hot, hot, hot,
with 100% chance of passion!

135
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,801
Fernando, you make
that joke every time.

136
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,304
It was that joke
that made you
fall in love with me.

137
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,768
Hey, Maggie,
how are you
doing back there?

138
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,942
Oh, so helpless.

139
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:11,866
Look,
it's the giant statue
of Christ on Corcovado.

140
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:17,163
Wow. It's like
he's on the dashboard
of the entire country.

141
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:21,208
It says here we can
get anywhere we want
by taking a conga line.

142
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,668
Way ahead of you, Marge.

143
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,255
Take me to the hotel

144
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,342
My hands are on a guy's ass
Boy, this dude must work out

145
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,765
Hey! Hey!

146
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,899
Boy, they sure love
soccer here.

147
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,567
Kick it!

148
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,074
Goal!

149
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,285
Look, Marge.
I'm Brazilian!

150
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,458
"How to Loot Brazil"?

151
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,793
I got it!
I got it!
I got it!

152
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:16,055
Bart,
what are you watching?

153
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,097
Kids' show.

154
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,862
Bert and Ernie
left it to your imagination.

155
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,614
Look, the room
came with a fruit hat.

156
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,407
Hey, and a mini bar hat!

157
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,452
I'm Chiquita Banana
and I'm here to say

158
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,747
I will eat this Toblerone
and I will not pay

159
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,585
Guys! While you're
singing and dancing,

160
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,713
somewhere out there
Ronaldo is waiting
to be found.

161
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:53,467
There he is! Oh, wait.
You said brown hair, right?

162
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,930
What a charming neighborhood.

163
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,057
Mom, these are slums.

164
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,017
The government just
painted them bright colors

165
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,852
so the tourists
wouldn't be offended.

166
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,020
Works for me.

167
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,355
Yeah. Check out the rats.

168
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,693
Ooh! They look like Skittles!

169
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,944
Here we are!

170
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,696
"123 Papaya Street. "

171
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,364
This is Ronaldo's orphanage.

172
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,160
Excuse me.
We're looking for
this little boy.

173
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,956
Ah, yes. Ronaldo.
He went out months ago.

174
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,208
And we haven't
heard from him since.

175
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,544
Every day we light
a candle for him.

176
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,379
Have you tried
looking for him?

177
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,672
That's plan B.

178
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,674
We're never
going to find him.

179
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,219
Now, Lisa,
it's not as bleak as that.

180
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,805
Can you fly me over
town to look for him?

181
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,308
We nuns cannot fly.

182
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,393
Oh, too much
junk in the trunk, eh?

183
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,477
Yes.

184
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,569
Have some meat
on a sword, Lisa.
It'll cheer you up.

185
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,656
You know I'm a vegetarian.

186
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,325
But you're on vacation,
honey.

187
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,285
I'm not wearing
my wedding ring.

188
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,453
Homer!

189
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,956
Okay. On this map I marked
all the places that
Ronaldo liked to go.

190
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,500
If we split up,
we should be able
to search them all.

191
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,463
We'll do our best.
Now, let's get going!

192
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,174
Check, please.

193
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,717
Si!

194
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,637
Does that include tip?

195
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:21,930
Si!

196
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:26,977
Hey, look.
There's Copacabana beach!
The heart and soul of Rio!

197
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:34,693
Excuse me, Americans!

198
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,362
How did you know?

199
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:41,867
There is a dress code
on this beach.
But we can help you.

200
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,788
I feel so European.

201
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,166
Huh. Mine keeps disappearing.

202
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:51,752
Oh, well.

203
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,549
Oh, I hope they're
going somewhere good.

204
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,010
Okay, boy.
Let's strut our stuff.

205
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,637
I'm in Rio

206
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,015
and I'm walking on the beach
I'm in my Speedo

207
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,899
No! No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

208
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,660
Excuse me.
We think this boy
might be here.

209
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,080
Okay, this is a samba school.
This is not a lost and found.

210
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,460
This is where we invented
the lambada and the macarena.

211
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:38,257
We are now developing
our most powerful dance,
the penetrada.

212
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,135
It makes sex
look like a church!

213
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,304
I don't think my daughter
should hear this.

214
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:48,684
You can't
protect her forever!
You stupid lady!

215
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:56,442
Give me a drink with all your
sweetest Brazilian fruits
mixed together.

216
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,195
Here you go.

217
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:05,951
Sweet. Sweet. Sweet!

218
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,043
There's got to be
a million kids here.
We'll never find Ronaldo.

219
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,879
Ronaldo?
You know him?

220
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,841
No, no.
I was just distracting you
while my children robbed you.

221
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:28,098
Oh, look at all
the stuffed coatimundi.

222
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,309
I bet Maggie would like one.

223
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,272
I'll just get
her this bracelet.

224
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,026
Everything here
is something.

225
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,446
Hey, Bart.
How many more places
do we have to search?

226
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,323
Just one,
and it's across town.

227
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,866
Taxi!

228
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,914
My American friend,
I'm afraid that this
is a kidnapping.

229
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,500
So that means
I don't have to pay the fare?

230
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,418
I suppose...
Woo-hoo!

231
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,170
I'm afraid you
don't appreciate

232
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,339
the seriousness
of the situation.

233
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,550
Fine. Take me,
but let the boy go!

234
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,011
I'm afraid he has
already gone.

235
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,111
Where are you taking me?

236
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,323
Shut up. And take that
stupid bag off your head.

237
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,909
No. It smells like cinnamon.

238
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,994
Behold, the Amazon.

239
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,455
But quick because
we're burning it down.

240
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,123
Listen,
I really need a rest stop.

241
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,500
Again?

242
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,044
I have a bladder
the size of a Brazil nut.

243
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,754
We just call them nuts here.

244
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,343
Suckers.

245
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,221
Suckers!

246
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,394
I guess
planning a vacation
around a missing kid

247
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,938
is not the way
to have fun.

248
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,106
Hey.

249
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:04,069
Time for
Brazil's favorite
kids' show, Teleboobies.

250
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:10,117
Clockwise!
Counter-clockwise.

251
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,744
Where's your father?

252
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,246
Kidnapped.

253
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,748
Oh, my God!
What are we supposed to do?

254
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,792
I don't know.
Wait for the call.

255
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,420
On top of. Beneath.

256
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,839
On top of. Beneath.

257
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,633
So, you want me to
find your husband?

258
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:27,759
Yes.

259
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,636
And you also want me
to find a little boy?

260
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:30,762
That's right.

261
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,265
I don't think there
is a boy or a husband!

262
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,684
I think you have
a thing for me.

263
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,062
I've been shot!

264
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,274
I am flattered,
but I do not swing that way.

265
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,651
I have another itch.

266
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,570
Yeah, well,
scratch it yourself.

267
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,322
I'm not going there again.

268
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,407
I have sent the ransom note.

269
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:55,162
If your family wants
to see you alive again,
they would be wise to pay.

270
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:59,041
I don't know.
They've been seeing me alive
for free for a long time.

271
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,338
So, have you got
the $50,000?

272
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:08,925
Well, with all our savings
and the money
Grampa wired us,

273
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,094
we have $1,200.

274
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,890
That's very nice, honey.
That'll buy you

275
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,727
one of my legs
or something they
call a mystery bag.

276
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,103
I'll get back to you.

277
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,730
They have $1,200.

278
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,984
$1,200?
You've already
eaten that much.

279
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,903
Come on. I didn't...

280
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,656
Well, maybe.

281
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,866
Enough of your blarney!
Get the money!

282
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,535
Ahoy-hoy.

283
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,288
Mr. Burns,
it's Homer Simpson.

284
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:41,291
I've been kidnapped
and I need $50,000.

285
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:46,213
Hmm. Well,
I'm high on sheep embryos,
so I am feeling charitable.

286
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:49,007
How about
I advance you the money
and you work it off?

287
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,300
No deal!

288
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,972
Moe's Tavern.
Home of the stinkiest
rag in America!

289
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,349
Hey, Moe.

290
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,976
Homer, listen.
I need 50 grand.
Don't ask me why.

291
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,937
No, no.
I need 50 grand!

292
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,522
I asked you first!

293
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,274
Fine.
I'll send you 50 grand.
Thanks.

294
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,736
Hello, Flanders.
I need 100 grand.

295
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,571
Well, I don't
really have that much.

296
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:15,325
But if you need it that bad,
you'll be in my prayers.

297
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,993
Go suck a Bible!

298
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,041
This is all my fault.

299
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:26,086
I came to find someone,
but now I've just
lost Dad and...

300
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,171
What is that noise?

301
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:31,883
That irritating,
intoxicating music
with a beat

302
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,927
that sends your
inhibitions packing?

303
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,387
It's Carnival!

304
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,565
Oh, your father
would've loved this.

305
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,901
The drunkenness,
the ambiguous sexuality...

306
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,447
I've got to
get out of here!

307
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:58,994
You cannot run from Carnival!
Because even running
is a kind of dance!

308
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,122
I am on fire, and I dance!

309
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,792
I'll just dance and
worry at the same time.

310
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,388
Hey, look!
It's the stripper
from the kids' show.

311
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,641
She makes paying
attention cool.

312
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,231
Lisa! Lisa!

313
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,610
It's me, Ronaldo!

314
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,111
Ronaldo!

315
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,614
Yes.
I am Flamenco Flamingo.

316
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,034
And it all started
with the dancing shoes
you bought me.

317
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,410
Why didn't you tell me?

318
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:41,620
I tried to write.

319
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,122
But I didn't know
what state you lived in.

320
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,249
It's a bit of a mystery, yes.

321
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:49,628
But if you look at the clues,
you can figure it out.

322
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:53,673
Oh, no!
The parade, she starts.
Meet me at the estudio.

323
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:54,800
Where is it?

324
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:55,884
That way!

325
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,556
Here is the ransom
for your father.

326
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,308
Are you sure
you can afford it?

327
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,310
I make as much as
Malcolm in the Middle.

328
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,730
And because I
have no parents,
my earnings remain unstolen.

329
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,443
We're supposed to
bring the ransom money

330
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,111
to the top of
Sugar Loaf Mountain.

331
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,322
The tension is killing me!

332
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,657
How about this?

333
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:23,662
That's not tense enough.
It's making light
of the situation.

334
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,707
Yup, that's it.
Just right.
That's the one.

335
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,417
Look, there's Dad!

336
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:34,339
Listen,
I made a little scrapbook
to remember the kidnapping.

337
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,592
I'm still working on it.
But as you can see...

338
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,263
Look.
This is that cigarette butt
you burned me with.

339
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,098
You slept like a baby
that night.

340
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,102
I remember that, yeah.

341
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,649
Homer,
why are you laughing?

342
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,693
He has
the Stockholm syndrome.

343
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,863
He has come
to identify with
his captors.

344
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,073
They let me
stay up all night!

345
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,325
Well, you won't be
doing that at home.

346
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,287
Now, hand over the money
and you get your Homer back.

347
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,962
Look at all that
pink and purple.

348
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,797
Our money sure is gay.

349
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,090
You are free to go.

350
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,216
Woo-hoo!

351
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,012
Piece of cake!

352
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:29,060
We should make
these transfers
in a safer place.

353
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:32,814
It was Homer's idea.
You say no to that face.

354
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,748
Homie, are you okay?

355
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,083
Yes, honey.
I'm better than okay.

356
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:55,587
Because I've learned
that no matter
how bad I screw up,

357
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,756
you'll always bail me out.

358
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,049
Aw...

359
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,305
Mom? Dad?

360
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,223
We better do
something about this.

361
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:10,018
Don't be sad.
It's Carnival!

362
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,607
Whoopee!

363
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,950
