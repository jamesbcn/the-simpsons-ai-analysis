00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,770
You're my rock, Homie.

348
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,606
And l promise this rock
is gonna weigh you down

349
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,358
for the rest of your life.

350
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,526
Aw!

351
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,697
Honey, no one messes
with my missus.

352
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:15,367
l'll come down on those guys
like the garage door
on Bart's bike!

What are you going to do?

354
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,037
You just leave
everything to Homer.

355
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:22,624
And now l believe you owe me
half a sandwich.

356

near the bed for you.

watched it first.

HOMER: You've probabIy
heard a lot of

360
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,347
bad things about
"Families Come First."

361
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:40,517
But newspaper writers
are a bunch of jerks.

362
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,770
Who reaIIy opposes
"Families Come First?"

363
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,190
Many chiIdIess advocates
are like Ben Affleck.

"Families Come First"
is supported by

life-long Springfieldians
you know and trust.

369

Either way.
The important thing
is the system works.

383
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,957
And the bumper stickers
misspelled "on."

384
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:49,252
They all say,
"Yes No 242."

Bart, why are we fighting?

405
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,009
Because we're kids.
