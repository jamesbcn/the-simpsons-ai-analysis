1
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,299
Mmm, cookies.

2
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,301
They're not cookies,
they're biscuits.

3
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,769
That's British for cookies.

4
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:38,539
And they're not for you
or you or you.

5
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,407
Or you or you. Not you.

6
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:41,575
Not for you.

7
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,046
These treats are for my lady friends.

8
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,415
They're coming over to watch
a very classy

9
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,584
historical British
streaming show,

10
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,452
and none of you are invited.

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,489
Cor blimey.

12
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,394
Now here's a distraction
for each of you.

13
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:05,832
I downloaded you a podcast
about beers

14
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:08,235
that you don't hear
much about anymore.

15
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:12,239
Ooh, there's a whole episode
about I öwenbr äu.

16
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:17,744
If no one minds,
I brought a few beverages

17
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,513
to lubricate the evening.

18
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,082
- Me, too. - Same.
- Way ahead of you.

19
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,951
So what the hell are we
waiting for?

20
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,919
Let's dial up the Netflix.

21
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:28,655
I've got Helen Lovejoy's
password.

22
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,235
She came to live with us
when she and the Reverend

23
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,527
were taking a break.

24
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,730
She swore me to secrecy
about that, but whoops.

25
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,004
The Springfield ladies had

26
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,907
a marvelous time
journeying back to an era

27
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:51,178
when England was filled with
eligible young ladies in corsets

28
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:53,046
courted by hot,
multiracial dudes

29
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,682
with rock-hard abs.

30
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:02,689
The writing on this show
is amazing.

31
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:09,096
Oh-ho. Men can have
muscles on their chests now?

32
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,098
The ad in the beer podcast

33
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:12,666
is an ad for beer.

34
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,269
That is so smart.

35
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,009
I've just swum back from Europe.

36
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,545
We've just won
the Battle of Knicker-bulge.

37
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:28,015
Let us all doff our clothes
in triumph.

38
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,585
¡Ay, caramba!

39
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,453
Bart, don't watch that.

40
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:34,788
Now go to bed.

41
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,125
Mmm, looks like the Earl
of Sixpackingham

42
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:40,527
is showing the whole
walking stick.

43
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,163
Ooh, I'll drink to that.

44
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,114
Honey, what's wrong?

45
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,383
You look like what I see
in the mirror every morning.

46
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,254
Also, a strange blender is
on your nightstand.

47
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,823
I think I drank just

48
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,892
a toonsie-teensy bit too much

49
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,560
with the girls last night.

50
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:16,697
Marge, you need to take
a long look at yourself.

51
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:20,367
We can't be a two-hangover
household. We just can't.

52
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,870
I'm sorry, sweetie,
but I just don't think

53
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,105
I can go to church
this morning.

54
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,608
Oh, my...
Aw...

55
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,409
No church? Oh, no.

56
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,912
Well, I guess I'll have
to find another way

57
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,647
to spend my Sunday.

58
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:45,292
Mmm, chest chips.

59
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,828
I meant you'll have to
take the kids to church

60
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:50,030
- on your own.
- D'oh!

61
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:53,033
Aw, it's not fair.

62
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,469
I always go to church hungover.

63
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:58,005
It's always the committed
drinkers who get punished.

64
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,774
Boozehounds just can't
catch a break.

65
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,357
You know, hymns like that

66
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,827
make God come off
a little thirsty.

67
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,230
Now I'd like to invite
our littlest angels

68
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,000
to head to Sunday school
with Mrs. Lovejoy.

69
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,973
Try spending a weekend with her
in the Wisconsin Dells.

70
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,043
This week's
Junior Jesus Jamboree topic

71
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,445
is "Honor Thy Mother
and Father."

72
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:41,215
- Who would like to go first?
- Oh! Oh!

73
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,317
Sunday school presentations
don't affect my grades

74
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,918
and won't help me
get into college,

75
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,787
and I'm not even
a practicing Christian,

76
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,189
but I still have
a sick need to excel,

77
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,792
so pick me! Pick me! Pick me!

78
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,861
I think we'll start with... Hmm.

79
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:59,533
Bart Simpson.
Oh, but I'm guessing

80
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,369
you forgot all about
your presentation.

81
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,605
You know, Helen,
for a woman of faith,

82
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,273
you have so little of it in me.

83
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,309
For this assignment,
I was born ready.

84
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,012
Well,

85
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,881
it's not hard
to honor my mother.

86
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,750
Marge is a class act
all the way.

87
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,286
As for my father, well,
with a dad

88
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:23,257
like Homer Simpson,
how could I not honor him?

89
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:30,430
He's so hardworking
and dignified.

90
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,476
And he carries himself
with such class and panache.

91
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,611
Mascot, oh, goes for the kiss

92
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,948
and, oh, he goes into the
proposal with the bouquet.

93
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,950
Tosses it away
and he faints out of love,

94
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,617
and the big, fat guy
is having none of it

95
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:52,753
and he's giving chase.

96
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,422
- The fat guy is on the field.
- Come here, you.

97
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:57,424
And the Freak is running away,

98
00:05:57,491 --> 00:06:00,227
and he's using the players
as obstacles.

99
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:01,562
And now he's smashing his...

100
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,263
You know something,
that's just not right.

101
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,719
Sweetie, do your thing.

102
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:33,994
Baby coming through.
Crying now and pooping soon.

103
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,469
As you can see,
wherever my dad goes,

104
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:43,904
people cheer.

105
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,240
Look, if you didn't want me
to pee in a cup,

106
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,675
then the movie
should have commercials.

107
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:52,079
Whiz break!
Whiz break! Whiz break!

108
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,081
Get him out of here.

109
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,352
In conclusion, I honor my father

110
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:02,923
because he is
not not not not a loser.

111
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,726
One, two, three, four.

112
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,661
That's an even number of nots.

113
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,663
He thinks I'm a loser.

114
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,933
How dare you show your peers
a supercut of me at my worst?!

115
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,370
Haw-haw!

116
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,272
Haw-haw-haw!

117
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,576
I hate the Welsh,
but I hate you even more!

118
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,152
My son has no respect for me.
He shamed me

119
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,463
in front
of the whole Sunday school.

120
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:35,822
Even Ralph.
What about all the videos

121
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,825
of me not being a loser?
Where were they?

122
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:40,394
Oh, boy. It's so sad

123
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,397
that kids just use cameras
for shaming.

124
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,367
We've raised a generation
that only loves fails.

125
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,469
My fails.

126
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,642
At least I have a lady
to rub my face.

127
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:59,746
Bart's gonna spend the rest
of his life lotioning himself.

128
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:01,615
Maybe Bart doesn't understand

129
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:04,818
how hard you work
to provide for this family.

130
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:05,752
When I was a girl,

131
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,088
my father took me to work
with him one day.

132
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:11,091
I felt so proud
when I saw him playing pizza

133
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,293
in that antacid commercial.

134
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,028
That's what I should do.

135
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,530
Take Bart to work.

136
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,465
Then he'll be proud of me.

137
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,067
Pizza proud.

138
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,873
Seven, eight and nine.

139
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,776
Watch me work

140
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:32,479
and be proud, you jerk.

141
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:33,881
No.

142
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,315
I don't want
to hear your friends

143
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,985
tell me how big I've gotten.

144
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,956
Oh. Well-played, big man.

145
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,659
Larry!
Slap a guest badge on him!

146
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,094
Larry!

147
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,430
And this thing over here
is if the core gets too hot.

148
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:51,531
I'm all over that.

149
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:54,735
And this dealie over here
is if the core...

150
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,103
goes missing.

151
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,871
Has that ever happened?

152
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:00,440
Not on my watch.
And the way you can be sure

153
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:03,544
is that everyone you know
isn't dead.

154
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:05,679
Hey, Homer.

155
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,314
Monday morning doughnuts
are here.

156
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:10,984
Take your pick.

157
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,086
Chocolate frosted? Maple bar?

158
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,222
Better hurry
or you're gonna get plain.

159
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,558
Doughnuts.
Do you have to pay for 'em?

160
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,760
Sure, technically.

161
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,829
It's an honor system.

162
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,043
A pop machine full of free pop.

163
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,636
A TV showing that jerk Dr. Phil.

164
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,939
A poster on how to choke a guy.

165
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,674
I think that's
for after you choke him.

166
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,209
Simpson,

167
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,743
I need that updated spreadsheet

168
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:38,846
on the hard water
degradation rate.

169
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,447
Watch this.

170
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:41,615
I told you interns

171
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:44,184
to spread-date the graduation
on the hard lemonade.

172
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,119
So find out
what I'm talking about

173
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:49,690
- and get it done!
- Yes, Mr. Simpson.

174
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,228
And you get free markers?
When I get back to school,

175
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:57,030
I'm gonna go Sistine Chapel
on those toilet stalls.

176
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,032
Why wait?

177
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,235
Here you go, Simpson.

178
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,904
Best part of the job.

179
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,172
You know it, Linda.

180
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,940
Dad, is that your paycheck?

181
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,709
Sure is.

182
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,511
Can I see it?

183
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,513
I'll do you one better.

184
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,090
Give it to me in singles.

185
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:26,660
Minus
the 8.5% check-cashing fee.

186
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,162
I didn't ask
for your life story.

187
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:32,933
And here's
what makes it all worthwhile.

188
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,336
You get all that every week?

189
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,972
Every two weeks.

190
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,213
Ah, the laugh of respect.

191
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,753
Oh, my God, is it picture day?

192
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,556
Lisa, quick,
let me fix your hair.

193
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,758
Ow! It's not picture day,

194
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:00,127
and my hair's not pasta.

195
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,095
I am dressed this way
to honor Dad.

196
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,464
I never thought about it,
but Homer makes enough

197
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,900
to pay for this awesome crib,
two cars,

198
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,969
with enough left over
to fill the freezer

199
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,737
with three kinds
of french fries:

200
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:14,074
Waffle, curly and steak-cut.

201
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:15,642
Dad, all these years

202
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,412
I thought you were
just some uncool roommate

203
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:19,746
that I got stuck with.

204
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:23,650
Now I realize you're a winner.

205
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:28,455
And that's why I want to be
a nuclear safety inspector.

206
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,525
Marge, he doesn't
just respect me.

207
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,993
He wants to be me.

208
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,628
What a feeling.

209
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:38,866
Oh... this must be
how LeBron feels about...

210
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,034
...Bronny.

211
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,037
Just like you, Dad, I can't wait

212
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:45,405
to live the American dream.

213
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,007
Well, actually...

214
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:49,776
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

215
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,478
Pew, pew, pew!

216
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,146
I'm a superstar spaceman.

217
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,049
I'm a modern superhero.
I can fly,

218
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,619
but I can't process
my own trauma.

219
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,454
I'm a nuclear safety guy.

220
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:02,823
I get tons of money
for not blowing the town up.

221
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,158
Well, the thing about that is...

222
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,995
- What?
- Nothing.

223
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:11,098
Forget I said anything.

224
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:14,067
Hey, Dad, guess what.

225
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:17,738
I made a homemade ID badge,
and Larry just waved me in.

226
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,240
Huh. Where is he?

227
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,881
Oh, man, what a gig.

228
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:29,183
Homer's got it made.

229
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:31,084
He sure does.

230
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:34,021
So, you're visiting your old man
at work today?

231
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,023
I sure am. And this sweet job

232
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:39,226
will be mine someday.

233
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:40,327
Wha...?

234
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,062
Hate to burst your bubble, kid,

235
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:43,964
but the kind of job your dad has

236
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:46,767
- just doesn't exist anymore.
- Why not?

237
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,535
Well, there's no simple answer
to that.

238
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,238
- All right. See you later.
- Bart, come with me

239
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:53,273
to a magical place
far in the past:

240
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:55,809
America in the 20th century.

241
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,244
Uh, sure.

242
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:59,580
But you better not
start singing.

243
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:05,012
The decline of unions,
rampant corporate greed,

244
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:06,280
Wall Street malfeasance

245
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,215
and the rise
of shortsighted politics

246
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,984
all contributed to increased
economic inequality,

247
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,654
widespread real unemployment,
wage stagnation,

248
00:14:13,754 --> 00:14:18,058
and a lower standard of living
for millions of Americans.

249
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:41,582
All right, thanks
for the history lesson, nerds.

250
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:43,650
But what does any of this
have to do with me?

251
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,652
You see, my dad's still working,

252
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,955
and I want to be just like him.

253
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,223
I'm sure you do.

254
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:51,325
But there's something else
you need to learn,

255
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:54,261
and my friend here
is happy to teach you.

256
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:55,562
Ugh, you.

257
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:58,465
For days, you've been dying
to say something. Just spill it.

258
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,662
I'll probably just buy
a PlayStation 6.

259
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,217
Okay, so, you're saying
maybe I'll have a tough time

260
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:51,919
getting a job like my dad's.

261
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,253
No, no, I'm saying

262
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:55,031
you'll definitely never get
a job like your dad's,

263
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:56,423
and you'll have a tough time

264
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,692
finding
something significantly worse.

265
00:15:58,792 --> 00:15:59,869
Thanks for the song and dance,

266
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:02,663
but I think
I'm gonna be just fine.

267
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:35,495
No. Just... no.

268
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:39,166
Okay, great.
So I have no options whatsoever.

269
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:41,568
Smell you later, dude.

270
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:42,736
Isn't it infuriating?

271
00:16:42,803 --> 00:16:44,805
We'll never live
as well as they did.

272
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:46,640
Why doesn't anyone do anything
about this?

273
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:49,443
Well, there's an answer to that,
but it's not one you'll like.

274
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,710
So, as you can see, Bart...

275
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,779
Bart?

276
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:10,490
Burn it.

277
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:12,626
"Burn it"? Burn what?

278
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:14,094
Well, that's up to you.

279
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:17,231
All I know
is what a janitor knows.

280
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,207
I do enjoy destroying things.

281
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:30,010
And this tie looks flammable.

282
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:33,152
Wait, Bart, I meant the system.

283
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,048
Burn it down and then reform it.

284
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,316
It was a metaphor.

285
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:39,086
Eh. I never learned
what that word means.

286
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:42,289
- Our education system is also terrible.
- No!

287
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:02,209
Oh, my God.

288
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:05,179
Oh, so this is real?

289
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:06,813
Help!

290
00:19:06,914 --> 00:19:09,016
I want to live
to see the future,

291
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:11,685
even if it's gonna be
incredibly crappy!

292
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,497
You saved me.

293
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,402
Thanks! By the way,
how good's your pay?

294
00:19:42,082 --> 00:19:44,084
Mom, Dad,
I figured out what I'm gonna do.

295
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:45,586
I'm gonna be a fireman.

296
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:48,989
Well, it is true that fire
isn't going anywhere.

297
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,961
- What the hell was that?
- From what I can gather,

298
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:30,731
a singing janitor
took Bart on a magical journey

299
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:32,966
through
America's postwar economy.

300
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:36,003
Also, Lisa was a rapper.

301
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:41,041
I'm a little concerned that Bart
set his tree house on fire.

302
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:45,279
It does seem
like an escalation.

303
00:20:47,181 --> 00:20:49,116
Maybe we can use
this opportunity

304
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:50,918
to upgrade the backyard.

305
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:53,487
Yeah. We could get a gazebo.

306
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,556
That'd be nice.

307
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:59,693
I just read through
our homeowners policy.

308
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:01,461
We're not covered
for musical numbers.
