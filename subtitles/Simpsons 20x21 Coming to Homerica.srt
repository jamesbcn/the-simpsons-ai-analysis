1
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,178
It's dark!

2
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,921
Hey!

3
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,433
D'oh!

4
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:06,606
You've fallen right into my trap,
just like you did in Africa.

5
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,195
Krusty, there you are.
We've got business to discuss.

6
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:14,601
First off, we got big problems
with your talking home pregnancy tests.

7
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,170
Hey, hey! You're pregnant!
And it's not mine!

8
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,830
It's giving 20% false 'Hey, hey's.'

9
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:27,447
Okay. Repackage them as coffee stirrers
and sell them in the Philippines.

10
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,449
Genius. Now, another issue.

11
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,384
Studies show your Krusty Burger...

12
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,687
...is the unhealthiest fast food item
in the world.

13
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:38,952
Worse than a Double Krusty Burger?
- Somehow, yes.

14
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,161
Okay, here's what we do.

15
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,730
What's that food we never put
in any of our meals?

16
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,832
Vegetables?
- Yeah, those guys.

17
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,601
Find the cheapest one
and make a burger out of it.

18
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,037
Then throw it in a green wrapper
and double the price.

19
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,906
And say it's got none of those...

20
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,875
What are those unhealthy
he/she-sounding things?

21
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:59,012
Trans fats?
- That's it. And while you're in there,

22
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,247
spray a little nicotine juice
on the kids meals.

23
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,347
Get them hooked.

24
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,489
ANNOUNCER:
Coming up on The Drowningest Catch.

25
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,864
It was worth it to be on TV!
- Put our dying screams in the promo!

26
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:26,567
You know, kids,
the real drowningest catch is man.

27
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,352
It's a new world out there.

28
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,555
People care about their health
for some reason.

29
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,457
We know times have changed.

30
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,794
We at Krusty Burger
want to take advantage of that.

31
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,563
Introducing the Mother Nature Burger!

32
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:53,383
Made from 100% wheat-fed barley.

33
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,898
And now to take a yummy bite.

34
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,206
Mmm.

35
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,771
Tastes like a healthy future!

36
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,780
We're going to Krusty Burger!

37
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,748
Finally, a hamburger for the Hindus.

38
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:24,297
By the tusks of great Ganesh,
now no one can tell I am not American.

39
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,873
Look at me! I'm saving the Earth!

40
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,904
Where's my Nobel Prize?

41
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,675
What's wrong, old friend? Can't sleep?

42
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,861
Would some warm beer settle you down?

43
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,121
Uh-oh.

44
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:56,737
Those barley burgers were tainted?
Why did I eat twelve of them? Why?

45
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,063
Taken!

46
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,832
Occupied!

47
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,468
Hurling!

48
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,450
SEYMOUR: Attention, students.

49
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,038
Due to the recent queasiness,

50
00:05:19,138 --> 00:05:21,421
both the Presidential
Ab Crunch Challenge...

51
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,123
...and the Sloppy Joe-a-thon
have been canceled.

52
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:28,284
Skinner, if I die, I
want you to take over...

53
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,896
Really?
...the search committee...

54
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,376
...for a new superintendent.

55
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,469
Just hold my head
and say soothing things.

56
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,606
Third-grade math scores
are holding steady.

57
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,706
Oh, yeah.

58
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,811
The food poisoning has been
traced to a single ingredient,

59
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,379
tainted barley.

60
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,617
And where does that barley come from?
Our neighbor to the southeast, Ogdenville,

61
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,486
the state's barley basket
since it was settled 100 years ago...

62
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:54,787
...by Norwegian immigrants.

63
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,190
I'm here with barley farmer
Brendlif Jensen.

64
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,625
Brendlif?
- What happened is,

65
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,794
a big old rat
got caught up in the grinders there.

66
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:06,432
So my wife Dagne took a hose to it,
and it's all cleaned out now.

67
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:10,370
So you're guaranteeing it's safe to eat
Ogdenville barley once more?

68
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,706
Well, where there's barley,
there's rats, you know.

69
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,009
Now, when will you be starting
the interview?

70
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,149
That just went out live.

71
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,736
Well, then we're screwed.

72
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,828
Dad, are you sure you can put in
these new rain gutters all by yourself?

73
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,029
Yeah, maybe you're right.

74
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,833
I do have a bad history of going up
on roofs and waking up in hospitals.

75
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,202
Perhaps we could be of help,
don't you know?

76
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,771
Ogdenvillians work on my house?

77
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:23,042
Yeah. Ever since the barley bust,
the only work we can get is day labor.

78
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,777
We don't mind it. Work is work.

79
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,314
I like your can-do attitude.

80
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:32,118
And your facial hair screams
'rugged but reliable.'

81
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,955
You won't regret this, sir.
- You hear that, Bart? He called me 'sir.'

82
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:39,455
That means he knows I'm better than him.

83
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,296
Nicely done, guys. Lemonade?

84
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:47,816
A lemon version of barley-ade?
When in Springfield...

85
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,869
Don't that glug down right good, then?

86
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,373
Oh, yeah. Almost as good as barley-ade.
- Oh, yeah!

87
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,009
You know, I'm glad you've come here
to take all the jobs we don't want to do.

88
00:07:57,109 --> 00:08:00,169
Can't have too much of a good thing.

89
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,418
MAN: You fellas, too! Come on!

90
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:09,173
MAN 1: Oh, yeah!
MAN 2: Be right there then.

91
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,281
So Inga, this is our kitchen.

92
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,621
Did you have kitchens back in Ogdenville?

93
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:46,125
Ja. Before the dark days fell on my people
and we lost everything.

94
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,226
Great!

95
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,796
So you know your way around a blender.
Okay.

96
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:53,900
So if the dog's in the house,
don't let Grampa in, and vice versa.

97
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,403
Our neighbor Ned Flanders
drops by unexpectedly...

98
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,605
That I do.
...but he doesn't stay long.

99
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,940
No, I don't.

100
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,643
Kids, this is Inga, your new nanny.

101
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,344
A nanny? Woo-hoo!

102
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,246
Mom says I can have
ice cream for breakfast.

103
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,347
Oh, she's still here.

104
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,083
Mom, can I have ice cream for breakfast?
- No way, mister.

105
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:14,086
It's just chocolate chip pancakes
and syrup for you.

106
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:17,926
Inga, I'll be happy to eat
whatever you make.

107
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,289
Maggie, now you have a nanny.

108
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,698
Just like the ones Joe Piscopo
and Ethan Hawke left their wives for.

109
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,857
But hands off my Homie.

110
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,884
'Hands off the Homie.' Got it.

111
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:35,241
Sorry. Sometimes she's nervous
around new people.

112
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,176
Actually, she's just gassy.

113
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,680
A little lingonberry oil under the tongue
will clear it right up.

114
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:47,348
That's amazing! Now I feel bad
about calling your references.

115
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,958
So Selma, how did you meet?

116
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,528
I hired Thor Bjorn here
to kill some moles in my garden,

117
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,364
and, well, one thing led to another.

118
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:02,201
Ja. She has the same beautiful face
as my Great-Uncle Magnus...

119
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:05,304
...when he lay in the coffin
after his trolley accident.

120
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:09,108
Gee, this Ogdenville influx
has been great for everybody.

121
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:13,045
Yeah. Talk about taking jobs
Springfield men don't want.

122
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,884
Hey, Homer. Your blubber would light
our lamps for a year.

123
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:22,149
I zinged the oaf good?
- You zinged the oaf great!

124
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:31,507
Minnesota Vikings apparel?
This is Tennessee Titans country!

125
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,307
So many meters!

126
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:47,143
Step aside, Norwads.
Watch how the natives ride sky.

127
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:12,471
Three hours
and we still can't see a doctor?

128
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,374
It's because it's filled
with all these Norwads.

129
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,076
They even sneeze funny.

130
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:25,251
We're out of English forms.
You'll have to fill out a Norwegian one.

131
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,843
I can't read this sloopy-bloopy writing.

132
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,557
Typical foreigners,
clogging up the system.

133
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,527
I hurt my back unclogging
your septic system.

134
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,862
Sven, can you stop by tomorrow?
It's clogged again.

135
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,000
Come on, Bart.
We'll take care of you at home.

136
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,205
Oh, great. I caught their cold.

137
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,978
Okay, Bart. Now bite down
on the rubber dog bone and...

138
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,419
Thanks, Mom.
- Now how did this happen, again?

139
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,824
It wasn't my fault, I swear.
A couple of barley jerks dared me to.

140
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,860
Yeah? Well, I'm starting to wonder
if this town wasn't better off...

141
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,129
...before all these immigrants showed up.

142
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,352
I'd just like to remind
you that we were all...

143
00:12:12,452 --> 00:12:13,466
...immigrants at one time.

144
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,734
Well, you were a baby once.

145
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,036
Does that mean you still like milk
and hugs?

146
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,601
Yes. I'd like both right now.

147
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,077
Hey, this is all right.

148
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:34,353
Look at them barleyjacks celebrating
another one of their stupid holidays.

149
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:38,124
Hey, I ain't got no problem with them.
They pay in cash, they keep it clean,

150
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,359
and their mythology is rich
and enchanting.

151
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,329
Yeah. The redhead one said
today's the day Woden gave the herring...

152
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,465
...the greatest gift of
all. Its fishy taste.

153
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,834
Hey, Moe, what is that hoity-toity
beer they're drinking?

154
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,704
Oh, I don't sell beer no more.
I only serve Aquavit,

155
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,340
the Norwegian caraway-scented liqueur.

156
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,609
Wait a minute!
You're selling barleyjack booze?

157
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,310
How could you, Moe?

158
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,513
Hey, it's all about the King Haralds.

159
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,187
Well, since it's all you got,
give me a mug of that Aquavit.

160
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,089
Better go slow there, friend.

161
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,359
That stuff'll open up a can
of 'Oh, my goodness' on you.

162
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,499
I think I can handle it.

163
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,325
Hey!
Where did that Homer guy go?

164
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,199
More Aquavit, please.

165
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,447
You're late! And drunk!
- Shut up!

166
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,850
You lost your job?
- Well, it's not my fault!

167
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,921
Those Ogdenville guys plied me
with their native liqueurs and liquors.

168
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,821
But mostly liqueurs.
- Oh, poor Homie.

169
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,417
And you with your alcoholism.
- Yeah.

170
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:56,335
I propose that no Ogdenvillian be allowed
within the city limits of Springfield.

171
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,270
I share your xylophobia.

172
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,172
Dad, you mean 'xenophobia.'

173
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,675
'X ylophobia' would be
a fear of xylophones.

174
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,276
I am afraid of xylophones.

175
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,546
It's the music you hear
when skeletons are dancing.

176
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:11,717
Very well. Springfield will ban immigrants
and xylophones.

177
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,877
All in favor say 'aye.'
- ALL: Aye!

178
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,114
The border is now closed.

179
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,291
You'll never take my xylophone!

180
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,728
Notes, don't fail me now!

181
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,607
There's one, Chief.

182
00:14:29,707 --> 00:14:32,371
Well, he's too far, Lou. That's not fair.

183
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,307
Hey, there's another!
- He's on a bike, Lou.

184
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,443
So?
- So what am I? Superman?

185
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,044
Well, there's one coming
between your legs.

186
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,746
Where?
- There! Now! Right now!

187
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:43,349
Look between your legs!
- I don't... Oh, yeah.

188
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,117
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh...

189
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,653
No, he's too fast. It's hopeless, Lou.

190
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,456
We can't handle this.
We need help patrolling the border.

191
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,858
I mean, Springfield only has three cops.

192
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,262
Yeah, and Eddie's laid up
because of his gout.

193
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,987
Yep. Eddie loves his
lobster and port wine.

194
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:02,735
But it comes with a price.

195
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:06,272
Excuse me.
Do you have to pay to get in, or...

196
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,541
No, no, no. It's free. It's free.

197
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,544
Maybe we can ask private citizens
to guard the border.

198
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:12,878
Yeah. You know, vigilantes,

199
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,281
who would agree to do our job
for the adrenaline rush...

200
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:21,501
...that comes from having a tiny taste
of authority over your fellow man.

201
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:27,314
And all we're paying them is
bullets and beer.

202
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,828
I almost made a big mistake!

203
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,515
Men, our negative energy
has been harnessed...

204
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,152
...to help keep Springfield's border
secure from Ogdenvillians.

205
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:56,689
But first, our group needs a name
that evokes America's proud history...

206
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,325
...of citizens rising up
to defend our way of life.

207
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,426
The Klan?

208
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,629
Well, there are no bad ideas,
but let's keep trying.

209
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,065
The Nazis!
- Okay, you stop trying.

210
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,735
Hey, how about
The Star-Spangled Goofballs?

211
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,136
Goofballs it is!

212
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:14,740
I'll float above the border and radio
the location of illegals down to you.

213
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,978
My code name will be Screaming Eagle.
Yours will be Ground Losers.

214
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,580
What a fun day.
- Oh, this is gonna be good.

215
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,680
Release the sandbags!

216
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,486
Hey, why don't you let Carl and me try?

217
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,561
Okay. You guys get in as I get off.

218
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,839
This is Ground Loser,
what's your position? Over.

219
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,330
Cold. So very cold.

220
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,872
I'm sorry to say
that this poorly conceived patrol...

221
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:48,874
...carried out by a
group of rank amateurs...

222
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:52,845
...has somehow been a failure!
- Yeah, those barleyjacks are crafty.

223
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,314
One of them handcuffed me to this tree!

224
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,483
Not a tree, Chief. That's a street sign.

225
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,619
You just looped your belt around it
when you were changing your pants.

226
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,656
Okay. I'm hearing lots of problems
but no solutions!

227
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,425
This immigration problem is bigger
than we thought.

228
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,395
We need a way to keep these people
out of our community!

229
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:12,064
What can we do
to keep one group of people...

230
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:15,309
...away from another group of people?

231
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,523
Why you little... I'll kill you!

232
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,977
That's it! We'll build a fence!

233
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:28,981
Fence! Fence! Fence! Fence!
- Fence! Fence! Fence! Fence!

234
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,684
Homie, I don't think
we should build a fence.

235
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,053
Haven't we always taught the children
to make friends...

236
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,188
...with those who are a little different?

237
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,323
Yes.
- Yeah.

238
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:46,165
Maggie's first words are in Ogdenvillese!
- Now do you see, Marge?

239
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,467
Now do you see
why we must build that fence?

240
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,802
Build it, Homie!

241
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,838
Make it as tall as the sky
and deeper than hell!

242
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,646
All right.
Who here knows how to build a wall?

243
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,048
I know how to hire guys to build a wall.

244
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,480
Such as?
- The barleyjacks?

245
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,585
Yeah, right.

246
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:10,122
Okay. They can help us build the wall,
because they're good at it.

247
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,658
But then those good-for-nothings
have to go.

248
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,158
Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah, get them out of here!

249
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,374
So my girlfriend puts all these
pillows on the bed.

250
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,776
And you have to, like,
take them all off at night...

251
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,045
...and put them all back on every morning.

252
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:37,049
And if the little one
is in back of the big one, God help you.

253
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:41,086
And they always want the cat
to sleep in bed with you.

254
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,186
Exactly!

255
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,592
I had trouble finding
a four-button cardigan,

256
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:50,562
so I bought a three-button one
and sewed the extra button on myself.

257
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:54,033
This baby was a five-buttoner.
But I took a button off.

258
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:58,043
Maybe we're not so different, Sven.
- Maybe so.

259
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,741
You know,
if you put down an acrylic primer,

260
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,711
your satiric drawing
and its clever stink lines...

261
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,814
...will be there long after
your principal is gone.

262
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,449
Well, the guy at the store said
it didn't matter,

263
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,694
but I knew he was wrong. Thanks, man.

264
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,620
Sure is quiet around here.

265
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,282
Do you miss us?
- We miss you.

266
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,050
That's why we build a door!

267
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,819
Oh, we did miss you.

268
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:52,124
We missed your kindness, your hard work,
your sweet, plainspoken ways.

269
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:55,160
What are you barleyjacks waiting for?
Get in here!

270
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,597
We'd be more than pleased
to join you donut dunkers.

271
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:11,542
All right, boys. Round them up.

272
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:16,648
And throw them the swinging-est soiree
they've ever seen!

273
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,151
English - US - SDH
