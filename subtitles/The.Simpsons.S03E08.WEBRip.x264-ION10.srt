00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,599
"Name another Dad

175
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,008
you talk to

176
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,266
-Next.
-"What are your son's hobbies?"

177
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,768
Well, he's always chewing on
that phone cord.

178
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,560
He hasn't done that
since he was two.

179
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,903
-Then he has no hobbies.
-Oh, really?

180
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,479
Well, maybe you should go out
to the garage and see.

181
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,606
-Bart. Bart!
-What?

182
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,025
You don't have any hobbies,
do you, boy?

183
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,073
No, not really.

184
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,866
Well, that's what I...

185
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:12,949
Wait a minute,
What are you doing?

186
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,624
Building a Soap Box Derby racer.

187
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,622
(groans)

188
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,913
That's a hobby.

189
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,456
Hey, so it is.

190
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,919
Oh, my God.

191
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,789
I don't know jack about my boy.

192

193
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,384

You're also fat.

195

a racer, Martin?

211
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,054
In between some other projects.

212
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,887
Well, gentlemen,
if you'll excuse me,

213
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,393
I've booked some time

For starters, Mr. Simpson,
why don't you take

220
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,917
this complimentary copy of <i>Fatherhood</i>
by Bill Cosby.

221
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,130
If he's as smart
as he is funny, I'm sold.

222
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,131
Mr. Simpson,
if you want to be a good father,

223
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,303
you have to spend time
with your son.

224
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,972
That's easy for you to say,

225
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,050
you preachy, egg-headed
institute guy.

226
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,807
How much do you see your son?

227
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,558
Why don't you ask him
yourself.

228
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,810
-Homer, meet Dave, Jr.
-Huh?

229
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,692
How's your research coming, son?

230
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,649
I think we're near
a breakthrough.

231
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,060
-Good work.
-Thanks, Dad.

232
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,898
Oh, how I envy you.

233
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,653
Homer, that easy back
and forther you witnessed

234
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,645
didn't happen overnight.

235
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,316
It took years of effort.

236
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,624
I've never been afraid
of a little hard work.

237
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,448
That's the spirit,
Mr. Simpson.

238
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,453
Now, step one is to find an activity
the two of you can share.

239
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,576
Does the boy
have any interests?

240
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,122
-What boy?
-Your son.

241
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,575
Find something he likes to do
and share in it.

242
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,706
Well, he is building
a Soap Box Derby racer!

243
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,214
-Oh, that would be perfect.
-(klaxon blaring)

244
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,047
Dear God! Not again!

245
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,803
Bart, I'm going to help you
build that racer.

246
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,597
Thanks,
but I'm almost done.

247
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,350
Why don't you get back
on the couch and watch TV.

248
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,352
Okay.

249
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,393
No! I'm going to do it.

250
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,767
Sorry, Dad, but three-time Soap Box
Derby champion Ronnie Beck

251
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,185
never needed his dad's help.

252
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,113
But you can use me.
I'm good.

253
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,032
I built a lot of things
around the house:

254
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,610
-The spice rack.
-(glass shatters)

255
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,697
The bird feeder.

256
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,412
The Gymboree.

257
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,040
What was that?
Ah, who cares?

258
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,293
Son, please let me help you.

259
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,205
Come on, Dad.
It would be weird.

260
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,343
This isn't working at all.

261
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,340
It's hopeless.

262
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,841

263
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,970

All right, I will.

273
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,204
Son, I don't think
you should let me help you.

274
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,819
Oh, come on, Dad,
if you really want to help,

275
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,276
you can clean these paint
brushes.

Ugh! Your father's not
supposed to help build your racer,

295
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,303
but you should at least
consult him about it.

296
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,465

you can't make him.

301
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,151
Okay, fine.

302
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,401

It hurts! It hurts!

336
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,287
Owee! Owee! Owee! Ow!

337
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,955
Mm-hmm.

338
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,633
Young man, I'm afraid
this stress fracture

339
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,632
will require you
to be in a cast for six weeks.

340
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,925
But that means
I can't possibly race.

341
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,299
Son, you're lucky
to be alive.

342
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,845
Save your palliative clichés

343
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,098

Doctor.

344
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,810
Is it okay to visit?

345
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,351
(chuckling)
Of course.

346
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,064
Hey, man, cool crash.

347
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,614
-Way to cheat death.
-Thanks, Bart.

348
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,478
You had the best stick
out there, man.

349
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,605
I wish I could
build 'em like you.

350
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,572
That racer transformed me
into the twisted creature

351
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,413
you see before you.

352
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,698
I'll never race again.

353
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,832
If you don't race,
then Nelson will win.

354
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,330
Even if I wanted to,
I'm in no shape to do it.

355
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,793
Unless...

356
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,543
Bart, will you drive my car?

357
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,336
I don't know
if I should do that.

358
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,209
My Dad and I built
our car together,

359
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,086
and if I drove someone else's,
it would kill him.

360
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,304
On the other hand, I'll do it.

361
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,304
Okay, Bart. We've got
a lot of work to do on the car.

362
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,767
So I'm gonna pull you out of school
for the next couple of weeks.

363
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,268
Dad, I don't know
how to say this, but..

364
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,731
I don't want to drive your car.

365
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,650
It's slow, it's ugly.

366
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,649
It handles
like a shopping cart.

367
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,691
Bart, the car has a few bugs
in it, I admit that,

368
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,525
but we're Team Simpson.

369
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,030
Dad, I love you,
but you taught me to win.

370
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,163
When did I ever
teach you that?

371
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,819
Well, I picked it up somewhere.

372
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,948
And if I drive Martin's car,
I can win.

373
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,155
I'm sorry, but...

374
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,044
No, go ahead, leave me.

375
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,041
-Dad...
-Go on. Go on and win.

376
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,003
No, go on and win
without your Dad.

377
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,714
I'll just sit here
in Li'l Lightnin',

378
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,875
which the Simpsons built,

379
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,974
and remember that
for one brief shining moment,

380
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,929
I had a son.

381
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:14,894
Ow.

382
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,981
Ohh!

383
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,194
Dad, can you take me
to Dr. Hibbert's office?

384
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,444
-Why? What's wrong?
-Oh, nothing.

385
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,197
I just scheduled a tetanus
booster.

386
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,698
Maybe I'm being
a little anal,

387
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,570
but barefoot season's coming up

388
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,197
and there's a world
of rusty nails out there.

389
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,543
Oh, sure, I'll take you,

390
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,538
wait with you,
worry about you,

391
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,790
and then you'll ride home with
someone who has a faster car.

392
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,872
This is how you get your kicks,
isn't it, Lisa?

393
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,288
Hmm.

394
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,548
D'oh!

395
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,217
Martin, your bone
is healing nicely.

396
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,970
Tell me something
I don't know.

397
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,512
(chuckles)

398
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,885
Dr. Hibbert, Lisa needs a...

399
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,222
You!

400
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,976
Home wrecker!

401
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,478
Mr. Simpson, you have every
right to be angry.

402
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,652
But rest assured,
your son loves you.

403
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,361
-(growls)
-(screams)

404
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,571
(Hibbert laughs)

405
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,571
You certainly gave that boy
the heebie-jeebies.

406
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,373
-Dad, aren't you coming?
-No.

407
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,624
-Now, don't pout.
-I'm not pouting. You are.

408
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,577
Dad, you gotta come.

409
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,627
-I just got your hat out of the fridge.
-Sorry.

410
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,961
Don't you at least
have something to say to Bart?

411
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,507
HOMER:
No. Can't think of a thing.

412
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,511
Homer, I've always said
you were a good father.

413
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,604
I've always defended you
when people put you down.

414
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,930
-That's for sure.
-She ain't lyin'.

415
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,556
But I guess I was wrong.

416
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,692
You are a bad father.

417
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,810
Leave me alone.

418
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,185
(fanfare playing)

419
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,027
TV ANNOUNCER:
<i>Good morning, everybody,</i>

420
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,162

<i>that harkens back</i>

421
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,529
<i>to the carefree days</i>
<i>of the Great Depression--</i>

422
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,157
<i>The Soap Box Derby.</i>

423
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,043
<i>In just minutes,</i>

424
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,290
<i>these junior Al Unser, Jrs.</i>
<i>will lock horns.</i>

425
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,706
Huh?

426
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,803
"Name your son's hobbies."

427
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,918
Building a soap box racer.

428
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,215
"Name one
of your child's friends."

429
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,219
Martin.

430
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,800
Martin!

431
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,965
I'll curse that name
till the day I die!

432
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,644
Huh?

433
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,932
"Who is your son's hero?"

434
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,226
Three-time Soap Box Derby
champion, Ronnie Beck.

435
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,611
Wow. I'm one question away
from being a perfect father.

436
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,479
"Name another dad
you talk to about parenting."

437
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,487
Ohh!

438
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,688
Hey-hey-ho, Simpson.

439
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,988
Shut up, Flanders.
Flanders!

440
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,572
Flanders!
Flanders, uh... uh...

441
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,118
When should a boy start dating?

442
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,002
Well, sir, there are two schools
of thought on the subject...

443
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,459
Great! Thanks.

444
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,499
I talked to Flanders
about parenting!

445
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,632
I'm a perfect father!

446
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,839
Hold on, son.

447
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:49,999
I'm a-coming.

448
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,430
My friend and I have a bet.

449
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,389
Are you Mary Tyler Moore?

450
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,010
(screaming)

451
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,717
(belches)

452
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,387
Ooh! Wow!
It really is you.

453
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,976
Bart, if she breaks up on you,
steer away from the grandstands

454
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,112
or else you might kill hundreds
of innocent spectators.

455
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,900
Bart, what did I
just tell you?

456
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,614
Kill spectators.

457
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,485
What is the matter
with you?

458
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,622
It's my dad--
lying there on the couch

459
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,619
drinking a beer,
staring at the TV.

460
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,621
I've never seen him
like that.

461
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,543
Forget about your father!

462
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,001
You're driving for me now.

463
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,298
Do it for your old man, boy.

464
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,262
Simpson, prepare to die.

465
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,802
Let's rock.

466
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,796
MAN (on P.A.):
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

479
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,858

484
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,910
Congratulations, Bart.

485
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,865
Seeing you out there brought
back a lot of memories.

486
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,117
Thanks, Mr. Beck.

487
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,748
I was alone out there,

488
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,554
but someone was riding
with me in spirit.

489
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,299
This is for you, Dad.

490
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,091
No, son, you earned it.

491
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,934
I might remind you both,
I did design that racer.

492
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,641
The driver
is essentially ballast.

493
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,603
The better man won, Simpson.

494
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,984
You can really drive.

495
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,980
