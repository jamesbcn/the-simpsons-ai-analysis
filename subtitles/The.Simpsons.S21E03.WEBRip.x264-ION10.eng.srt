{\an8}how did you ever come up

00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,634
{\an8}like "crazy bowling"?

37
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,262
{\an8}I Googled "girls having fun,"

38
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,719
{\an8}and after wading through
97,000 pages of porn,

39
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,261
{\an8}I found "crazy bowling."

40
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,095
{\an8}Hmm, that’s odd.

41
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,850

the county, the state,

Look at this--
his lunch money.

123
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,628
God didn’t give you legs so
you could use them as scissors.

124
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,177
Well,
I was just doing the moves

125
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,300
I learned
from Ultimate Punching.

126
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,296

127
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,217
Ultimate Punching?!

128
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,386
"Ultimate" makes
everything worse.

129
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,555
Not Frisbee.

130
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,942
Otto, don’t you have
a sack to hacky?

131
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,100

One...

137
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,278
Aw, I messed up!

138
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:06,162
Okay, I’m going to put a stop
to this Ultimate Punching.

139
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,830
You can’t stop
an entire sport.

140
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,539
You’d need
several other mothers,

141
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,749
some sympathetic school
officials and clergymen...

142
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,119
-Uh-huh.
-A place to meet...

143
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,706
-Uh-huh.
-Some snacks...

144
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,251
-What else?
-A phone tree is invaluable.

145
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,955
How you fixed for staplers?

146
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,045
Those fliers don’t stick

147
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,919
to phone poles by
themselves, you know.

148
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,626
Nelson, you really have
a knack for this.

149
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,217
Well, when I grow up,

150
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,762
I hope to go into
event planning.

151
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,216
Oh, maybe someday
you can do Lisa’s wedding.

152
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,427
Oh, I’d like that.

153
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,400
(crowd cheering,
whistling)

154
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,356
-Oh, my God.
-Ooh, so violent.

155
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,695
-Bumped his nose!
-Oh, he hit him.

156
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,701
(grunting)

157
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:52,043
This goes on for a while.

158
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,410
Call me a killjoy,

159
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,286
but I think that because
this is not to my taste,

160
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,544
no one else should be able
to enjoy it.

161
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,786
I’m all over that.

162
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:00,707
-(all agreeing)
-Mm-hmm!

163
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,205
Mom, don’t do this.

164
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,626
This sport is as fun for me
as having kids is for you.

165
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,086
Tell her, Dad.

166
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,256
You love Ultimate Punching
even more than I do.

167
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,715
Ultimate Punching is
exploitative, violent,

168
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,716
and a bad influence
on our young people.

169
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,638
Studies have shown
your mother is right.

170
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,846
What the...?

171
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,056
(sniffs)

172
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,936
Chocolate,
whipped cream, cherries--

173
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,402
she got to you

174
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,402
with a piece
of Black Forest cake.

175
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,904
It wasn’t just a piece,

176
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,156
it was the whole cake!

177
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,118
(sobbing):
Frosting like snow

178
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,869
on the eaves of a
Bavarian castle!

179
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,163
(sobbing)

180
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,827
Glad you didn’t come cheap.

181
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,325
I couldn’t help it!

182
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:44,047
She knew my one
weakness-- that I’m weak!

183
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,473
WOMEN (chanting):
One, two, we say boo!

184
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,510
Three, four, stop the gore!

185
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,354
Five, six, who’s got tix?

186
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,179
Seven, eight,
use that gate.

187
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,104
(Homer and Bart giggling)

188
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,482
Ooh!

189
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,058
We need to take this
into the belly of the beast.

190
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,104
Mr. Scalper,
give me a ticket.

191
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,608
I am not a scalper.

192
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,279
I am a dude whose 200 friends
did not show up.

193
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,741
(annoyed grunt)

194
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,029
What do we do now?

195
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,492
Let’s talk about Marge
behind her back.

196
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,662
Have you ever noticed

197
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,990
how that baby of hers
never says a thing?

198
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,735
I think it saw
something awful.

199
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,497
-Me, too.
-That’s exactly
what it is.

200
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,039
-Oh, what else
could it be?
-Mm-mm-mm.

201
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:28,968
Hmm.

202
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,430
That woman has
natural breasts.

203
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,891
This can’t be good.

204
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,890
(gate rattling)

205
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,186
I’m Marge Simpson,
and I will not rest

206
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,019
until you tear down
this septagon.

207
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,315
CROWD:
What?! Boo!

208
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,229
Crazy dame.

209
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,777
Nobody tears down
the septagon.

210
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,450
Except for the arena crew
because <i>Hufflesnuffs on Ice</i>

211
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,530
needs the space
tomorrow.

212
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,655
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute,
I have a better idea.

213
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,457
<i>Marge, I’m Chett Englebrecht,</i>

214
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:04,209
<i>UPKCC founder, commissioner,</i>
<i>and public face of the sport.</i>

215
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,173
<i>(roaring):</i>
<i>Yeah-ah!</i>

216
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,964
(crowd roaring)

217
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,257
Pleased to meet you, Chett.

218
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,800
(all booing)

219
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,263
Guys, please.

220
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,553
When you yell like that,
no one can hear me.

221
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,847
(booing louder)

222
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,391
Chett, I’m here to ask
you one simple thing:

223
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,135
please go out of business

224
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,647
and donate all your profits
to charity.

225
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,149
ALL:
Boo!

226
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,521
At least in other sports,

227
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,487
they’re trying to put a
ball in a net or a zone,

228
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,149
but in this sport they don’t put
anything in anything,

229
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,158
and if they did,
I wouldn’t want to see it.

230
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,200
Hmm.

231
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,413
<i>Okay, you win.</i>

232
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,662
<i>ALL:</i>
<i>What?!</i>

233
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,663
<i>Annoying lady,</i>
<i>you make a great point.</i>

234
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,705
<i>I am going to shut down</i>
<i>this sport.</i>

235
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,710
-Really?
<i>-If you meet me</i>

236
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,552
<i>in the septagon,</i>
<i>fight me, and beat me.</i>

237
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,588
What?!

238
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,171
That’s crazy.

239
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,756
<i>What’s wrong, Marge?</i>

240
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,261
<i>Do you have</i>
<i>to ask your husband?</i>

241
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,513
(crowd laughing heartily)

242
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,305
-MAN: Good one!
-MAN 2: Zing!

243
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,268
(donkey brays)

244
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,308
That flattens my soda pop.

245
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,312
You’re on.

246
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,563
(crowd cheering)

247
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,564
What’d I miss?

248
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,766
Mmm, nothin’.

249
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,028
Mom, you can’t fight that guy.

250
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,112
Yeah, Marge, he’ll
knock your block off--

251
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,867
your beautiful block.

252
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,409
Thank you, Homie.

253
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:21,332
Listen, of all the crazy things
I’ve ever done,

254
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,042
this is the craziest,
and <i>you’re </i>doing it.

255
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,583
I can’t back out.

256
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,166
This is for a cause
that’s bigger than I am.

257
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,002
If Gandhi could go
without eating

258
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,797
for a whole three-hour movie,
I can do this.

259
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,013
Besides,
I’m a woman.

260
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,642
He’ll probably
go easy on me.

261
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,849
Or kick the crap out of you.

262
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,598
Watch your
language, moron.

263
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,021
Hmm?

264
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,389
(hard rock guitar riffs playing)

265
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,480
(laughing)

266
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,437
(grunts nervously)

267
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,238
If I’m going to open a can
of whup-tushy,

268
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,912
I’d better get in shape
with some rhythmic gymnastics.

269
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,332
-(classical piano playing)
-Ah!

270
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,581
Ah!

271
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,915
Aha!

272
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,919
♪ Ah-la! ♪

273
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:09,921
♪ La-la-la-la-la! ♪

274
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,462
Someone’s got
to stop her

275
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,705
from going through
with this fight.

276
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,927
This goes against every
feminist bone in my body,

277
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,008
but Dad, can’t you control
your woman?

278
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,804
How can I control her?

279
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,427
I have nothing
to withhold!

280
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,774
Oh, man, now she’s writing
cutesy things

281
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,809
with the ribbon.

282
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,772
(classical melody continues)

283
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,982
(sighs)

284
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,069
Ah-ah!

285
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,740
Homer, this is bad.

286
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,029
One unlucky punch

287
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,952
and Marge could be
bedridden for life.

288
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,780
Unable to move anything
but her left toe.

289
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:41,986
Yeah.

290
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:47,668
Oh, Marge, if only I knew
what these paintings meant.

291
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,248
(sobbing)

292
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,714
I know the woman I loved is
still in there somewhere,

293
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,626
behind all this nonsense.

294
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,046
We’ve gotta get Marge some
professional training.

295
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,045
Carl, do you know heavyweight
champ Drederick Tatum?

296
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,678
What? You think just
’cause I’m black

297
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:04,774
I know all other
black people?

298
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,269
Well, I, uh, uh...

299
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,520
Actually, Drederick and I
are very good friends.

300
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,942
We met through
Dr. Hibbert

301
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,110
at a party at Bleeding
Gums Murphy’s house.

302
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,609
Well, Marge, you have definitely
come to the right crib.

303
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,902
I’m always happy

304
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,605
to impart
my pugilistic prowess

305
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,275
to a punching parvenu.

306
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,323
Now, the first lesson will
be to work the tattoos.

307
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,036
Flaming skull.
Obama.

308
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,119
Scooby-Doo. Scooby-Doo.
Scooby-Doo.

309
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,914
Now, work
"The Lord’s Prayer."

310
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,708
I’m gonna order
some lion food.

311
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,881
Hello? Yeah,
how you doin’?

312
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,709
I’d like to order
two gazelles, an impala,

313
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,375
and throw in a couple
of wildebeests.

314
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,054
Oh, and a two-liter bottle
of diet cherry cola.

315
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,553
You just have
one-liter bottles?

316
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:41,514
Okay, cancel
the whole order.

317
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:47,055
The second element of mixed
martial arts is jujitsu,

318
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,231
in which we use an
opponent’s strength

319
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,480
against himself.

320
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,271
But I sneak some of my
strength in there, too.

321
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,265
(chuckles)

322
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,106
Now, attack me
with great anger!

323
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,283
(karate yell)

324
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,450
Surprising move!

325
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,108
(groans)

326
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,737
Next: Homer, <i>hajime!</i>

327
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,873
(karate yell)

328
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,290
Mmm? Hmm?

329
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,288
Now, we stick foot in mouth,

330
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,000
tie arms like pretzel,

331
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,170
and pop discs in spine
like bubble wrap.

332
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,210
(popping)

333
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,674
(chuckles)

334
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,714
Is he okay?

335
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,757
Oh, he feels no pain.

336
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,970
(muffled screams)

337
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,640
Sorry, my English
is not so good.

338
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,639
I mean, he feels
only pain.

339
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,511
(muffled screech)

340
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,017
(classical music plays)

341
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,768
Back when I wrestled at Yale,

342
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,690
I was in the lightest
weight category--

343
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:32,689
"ether weight."

344
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,770
Now, get ready to
face the wrath

345
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,185
of the "New Haven Nuisance!"

346
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,193
<i>CHORUS:</i>
<i>♪ Boola Boola, Boola Boola ♪</i>

347
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,857
<i>♪ Boola Boola... ♪</i>

348
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,236
(grunting)

349
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,202
(grunts, gasps)

350
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,082
(grunting)

351
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,369
Side-mount!

352
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,412
Takedown! Advantage!

353
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,745
Reversal! Reversal!

354
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,460
Clinch! Clinch, I say!

355
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,380
(sighing):
Listen,

356
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,838
I’m late
for a PTA meeting.

357
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,299
In order to save money,

358
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,629
the following presidents
will no longer be taught:

359
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,844
Buchanan, Fillmore,
Pierce, Bush, Bush--

360
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,926
could you please stop that?

361
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,391
Saratoga slam!

362
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,601
Aristotle’s dilemma!

363
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,971
Knickerbocker
knucklebreaker!

364
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,177
And so on.

365
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,517
(snoring)

366
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,811
Marge, I bet
we got ten minutes

367
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,895
till the kids wake up.

368
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,611
(both moaning)

369
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,361
-Marge! Marge! Marge!
-Huh?

370
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,193
(gasp, scream)

371
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,988
Tomorrow night your bedroom
will be the septagon.

372
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,372
Your sleeping pill
will be my punches.

373
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,199
By the way, what’s that book
you’re reading?

374
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,865
<i>Eat, Pray, Love.</i>

375
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,463
More like "Beat, Slay, Shove!"

376
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,579
The fireworks begin tomorrow!

377
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,376
(fireworks whistling, popping)

378
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,339
I said tomorrow!

379
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,420
No can do.

380
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,634
We’re out of fireworks.

381
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,304
Why’d you shoot ’em off now?

382
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,552
I have trouble concentrating.

383
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,554
I should be on antidepressants.

384
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,796
Ugh. Where was I?

385
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,968
"Beat, Slay, Shove."

386
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,015
Right-- "Beat, Slay, Shove!"

387
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,519
The fireworks start tomorrow!

388
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,192
(fireworks whistling, popping)

389
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,770
I found some more,
but that was it!

390
00:14:58,856 --> 00:14:59,856
Mmm.

391
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,816
A lot of people think
bullies are born awesome,

392
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,445
but the fact is,
we have to train.

393
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,992
You don’t get garlic knots like
these unless you work the bag.

394
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,497
(whistling)

395
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,120
-(grunts)
-(groans)

396
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,537
-(giggles)
-Is there someone in there?

397
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,127
It’s my own fault.

398
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,841
I looked them in the eye when
I gave them my lunch money.

399
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,053
Someone should tell
your principal!

400
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,763
I’m well aware
of the situation.

401
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:31,723
(electric organ playing
melodramatic melody)

402
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,191
Mom,

403
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,649
I came here to tell you

404
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,649
it’s not too late
to back out.

405
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,481
I can’t back out,

406
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,226
because if I fight him
tomorrow,

407
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,448
it’ll be a less violent world
for you kids in the future.

408
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,449
There must be
a better way.

409
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,621
HOMER:
There certainly is!

410
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,410
Marge Simpson reporting
for duty!

411
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,535
(Marge-like murmuring)

412
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,082
Dad, I keep telling you,
that won’t work.

413
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,326
Let’s go, Marge.

414
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,537
My class reunion starts
in an hour.

415
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,628
Uh, Moe, I have
a confession to make.

416
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,473
I’m just Homer
dressed as Marge.

417
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,088
Yeah, but last year I took
Barney dressed as Marge.

418
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,586
Think how much better
they’ll think you look.

419
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,848
Mmm?

420
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,059
Well, you’d better
not leave me

421
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,718
and talk to your
old friends all night.

422
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,267
Keep talkin’ like that
and I’ll leave you
here right now!

423
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,811
(fanfare playing)

424
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,984
Krusty, I’m honored
you invited me tonight.

425
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,364
Yeah, I thought
a noisy public place

426
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,821
would be the best spot
to tell you

427
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,031
that I’ve been
dating your wife.

428
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,321
(gasps)
What?!

429
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,494
Also, could you tell her
I’m dumping her?

430
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,492
After 11 years,
the thrill is gone.

431
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,284
I... I... uh...

432
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,328
Marge, I tried my best to
talk you out of this.

433
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,173
But since you’re going through
with it, I beg you,

434
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,669
just stay out of his way
and don’t get hurt.

435
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,842
And, Mom, if you punch
him in the junk,

436
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,721
you’ll get no disrespect
from me.

437
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,588
Hey, Bart, did you know
that’s a haiku?

438
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,545
BART:
Huh?

439
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,755
(grunts)

440
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,135
-(bell clanging in arena)
-(groans)

441
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,602
(audience chattering)

442
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,352
Time to square off in the ring--

443
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,595
that is, The Septagon!

444
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,017
In this corner,
weighing in at...

445
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,686
Nobody needs to know that!

446
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:06,534
Skip ahead!

447
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,488
Stands the "Mom
I’d Like To Fight"--

448
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,529
Marge Simpson!

449
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,452
(cheering, applause,
whistling)

450
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:17,542
And four obtuse angles over,
weighing in at 115 pounds,

451
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,999
Chett Englebrecht!

452
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,921
CROWD (chanting):
Chett! Chett! Chett!

453
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,590
Chett! Chett! Chett!
Chett! Chett! Chett!

454
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,920
And, now... let’s begin

455
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,506
to rumba!

456
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,432
We’ve been ready for hours!

457
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:37,470
I had car <i>trouble!</i>

458
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,306
(clangs)

459
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,730
(cheering)

460
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:41,889
Don’t worry, Marge.

461
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:42,807
Don’t want to hurt you.

462
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,015
-(sighing) I knew it!
-Pow!

463
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,435
(groans)

464
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,694
That’s the first time I ever hit
a woman I didn’t love. Wow.

465
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,696
(groaning)
Nine... aah!

466
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,793
Come on! Come on!
Get back on your feet!

467
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:58,908
I believe in you!

468
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,454
I’m doin’ it, Moe!

469
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,537
Not you.

470
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,372
Oh, thank God.

471
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,826
The pressure’s off.

472
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:04,876
(panting)

473
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,038
I’ll save you,
Marge!

474
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,956
(groans)

475
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,415
(gagging)

476
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,545
(grunting)

477
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,051
Hit my Mom, will ya?

478
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,302
Well, I’m gonna knock you out
and moon your corpse.

479
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,894
-(crowd booing)
-Heck, I’ll fight anyone.

480
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,849
Except a man
my own size.

481
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,140
(whimpering)

482
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,643
(sighs, grunts)

483
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:22,805
(gasps)

484
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:23,813
Yeah!

485
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,154
(all cheering)

486
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,150
(grunting)

487
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,942
That’s... my... son.

488
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,986
(screeching)

489
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,911
(yelling, grunting)

490
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:36,909
Whoo-hoo!

491
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,030
(sighs)

492
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,577
(grunts)

493
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,580
(groans)

494
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,412
(grunts)

495
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,497
(groans)

496
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,871
Tap out!

497
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,748
Don’t make me
break your arm!

498
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,955
Lady, why don’t you break out
the lipstick and kiss my ass?

499
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,336
There sure is a
lot o’ talkin’

500
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,802
for a professional fight.

501
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,762
Eh, that’s what you get
when you fight a woman.

502
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,093
Yap, yap, yap.

503
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,927
And they spend all day
eating bonbons

504
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,392
and watching
<i>General Hospital.</i>

505
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,022
Which, by the way,
has never been better.

506
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,600
Mmm! Mmm!

507
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,185
Okay, I give!
I give! I give!

508
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,190
You’re better
than me!

509
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,151
Really?
Ooh, thank you.

510
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,271
Now, let me go...

511
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,477
turn your back and take a bow.

512
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,898
Okeydoke.

513
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:14,896
(giggles)

514
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,947
(cheering, applause, whistling)

515
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,911
Thank you!

516
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,742
Mmm!

517
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,287
(gasps)

518
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,713
(groans)

519
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,380
(cheering)

520
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,223
I’d just like to say one thing.

521
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,301
I only agreed to this fight

522
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,966
because I wanted
to stop the violence.

523
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,925
And sure I got into great shape

524
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,476
and met some fun people,

525
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,939
but I ended up discovering
my own dark side.

526
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,771
So from now on,

527
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,356
the only thing I’m fighting is
this cold I’m coming down with.

528
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,153
(sneezing)

529
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,277
Mom, that’s
a beautiful thought.

530
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,704
Yeah, well,

531
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,832
I wish somebody would’ve
stuck around to hear it.

532
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,240
Where did they all go?

533
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,208
Two drunk guys were
fighting outside

534
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,208
and everyone went
to watch.

535
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,830
Ooh, ooh, can
I go, Marge?

536
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:10,707
Can I? Can I?

537
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,502
No. Let’s go home.
