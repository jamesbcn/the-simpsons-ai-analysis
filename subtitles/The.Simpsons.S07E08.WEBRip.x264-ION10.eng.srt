"Local hero shuns spotlight
and pitches in."

8
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:33,986
What an angle.

9
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,459
{\an8}I can't believe I'm spending
my Saturday picking up garbage.

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,670
{\an8}I mean, half these bottles
ain't even mine.

{\an8}Hey, where's Homer?

{\an8}How'd he get
out of this?

16
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,467
{\an8}HOMER:
Hey, everybody!

17
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,925
{\an8}Up here!

18
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,019
{\an8}Simpson, stop frolicking
and get to work.

19
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,691
{\an8}Right away, Mr. Smithers.

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,020
{\an8}I'll just walk across
these slippery ro... aah!

21
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,399
{\an8}Oh, no! He's going
over the falls!

22
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,619
{\an8}Oh, good. He snagged
that tree branch.

23
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,408
{\an8}Oh, no!
The branch broke off.

24
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,248
{\an8}Oh, good. He can grab on
to them pointy rocks.

25
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,539
{\an8}Oh, no!

26
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,502
{\an8}Them rocks broke
his arms and legs.

27
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,462
{\an8}Oh, good.
Those helpful beavers

28
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,503
{\an8}are swimming out
to save him.

29
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,126
{\an8}Oh, no.

30
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,633
{\an8}They're biting him
and stealing his pants.

31
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,467
{\an8}Good Lord. He'll be sucked
into the turbine.

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,600
(all gasp)

33
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,643
{\an8}Smithers,
Who was that corpse?

34
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,147
{\an8}Homer Simpson, sir.

35
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,359
{\an8}(sniffling)

36
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,358
{\an8}One of the finest,
bravest men

37
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,610
{\an8}ever to grace Sector 7G.

38

{\an8}(sobbing)

39
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,526
{\an8}I'll cross him
off the list.

{\an8}(Bart laughing)

41
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,622
{\an8}That dummy worked
like a charm, Dad.

42
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,410
{\an8}Best 600 bucks
I ever spent.

43
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,504
{\an8}Come on, boy.

44
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,658
{\an8}We've earned this Saturday.

45
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,076
{\an8}Now let's make
the most of it!

46
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,047
61, 62, 63...

47
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,893
Marge, we can't tell you
how sorry we are.

48
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,273
You have our deepest
condol-diddly-olences.

49
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,891
I'm sorry.
I-I'm just nervous.

50
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,098
I didn't mean
any disrespect.

51
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,267
What are you talking about?

52
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,265
You know, uh...

53
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,610
Homer's passing.

54
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,073
Away.

55
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,324
Into death.

56
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,195
What?

57
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,292
That's ridiculous.
Homer's not dead.

58
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,658
He's right out back
in the hammock.

59
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,880
Oh, Marge, of course
Homer's alive.

60
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,549
He's alive in
all our hearts.

61
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,588
Yes, Marge.

62
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,591
I can see him.

63
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,432
Hi, everybody.

64
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,548
Marge, I'm going to
give you the card

65
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,894
of our juvenile
counselor.

66
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:58,889
(doorbell rings)

67
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,967
A tombstone?

68
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,347
It came with
the burial plot.

69
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,814
But that's
not important.

70
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,104
The important thing is,
Homer's dead.

71
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,228
We've been saving for this
since your wedding day.

72
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,775
Get out of here
you ghouls!

73
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,609
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.

74
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,815
Hmm?

75
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,776
Uh, excuse me.

76
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,366
Sir, I think there's
been a mistake.

77
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,752
Oh, no. No mistake.

78
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:24,908
Your electricity's
in the name

79
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,746
of Homer J. Simpson,
deceased.

80
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,211
The juice stays off till you
get a job or a generator.

81
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,172
Oh, and, uh, my
deepest sympathies.

82
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,502
Mmm... Homer?

83
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,548
That's my name.

84
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,011
When I asked you
if that dummy

85
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,090
was to fake your own
death, you told me no.

86
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,716
You go downtown first
thing in the morning

87
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,262
and straighten this out.

88
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,756
LISA:
Mom! Dad!

89
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,267
Bart ran into a doorframe
and bit his tongue!

90
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,230
BART: What the hell'th
goin' on heah?

91
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,943
Listen here. My name
is Homer J. Simpson.

92
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,863
You guys think I'm dead,
but I'm not.

93
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,612
Now I want you
to straighten this out

94
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,113
without a lot of your bureaucratic
red tape and mumbo jumbo.

95
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,985
Okay, Mr. Simpson

96
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,582
I'll just make the change
here... and you're all set.

97
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,699
I don't like your attitude,
you water-cooler dictator.

98
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,707
What do you have in that
secret government file, anyway?

99
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,829
I have a right to read it.

100
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,455
You sure do.

101
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,671
"Wife: Marjorie.

102
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,671
Children: Bartholomew,
Lisa..."

103
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:17,513
Ah-hah! See? This thing
is all screwed up.

104
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,430
Who the heck
is "Margaret" Simpson?

105
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,759
Uh... your youngest daughter.

106
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,393
(mimicking)
"Uh... your youngest daughter."

107
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,851
Well, how about this?

108
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,641
This thing says
my mother's still alive!

109
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,484
She died when I was a kid!

110
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,979
You see that stone angel
up there?

111
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,021
That's my mother's grave.

112
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,725
My Dad points it out
every time we drive by.

113
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,396
Mr. Simpson, uh...

114
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,654
maybe you should actually

115
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,945
go up there.

116
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,028
Huh?

117
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,332
Oh, Mom, I'm sorry
I never come to see you.

118
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,119
I'm just not a cemetery person.

119
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,452
"Here lies...

120
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,788
Walt Whitman"?

121
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,212
(yelling)

122
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,711
Damn you, Walt Whitman!

123
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:57,052
I-hate-you-
Walt-freakin'-Whitman!

124
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,590
Leaves of Grass, my ass!

125
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,474
Wait a minute.

126
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:05,681
Maybe it's that other grave--
the one that says "Simpson"!

127
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,723
(shrieking)

128
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,306
Oh!

129
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,811
Why does my death
keep coming back to haunt me?

130
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,063
Oh!

131
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,941
You awful, awful man!

132
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,734
Get out of my son's grave!

133
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,197
I hate to rain on your parade,
lady, but this is my grave.

134
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,569
Hey...

135
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,775
wait a minute...

136
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,155
Mom?

137
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,701
Homer?

138
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,366
I thought you were dead!

139
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,286
I thought you were dead!

140
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,134
Oh, dang blast it.

141
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,959
Isn't anybody in this
dad-gummed cemetery dead?

142
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,126
I didn't want
to cause a fuss

143
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,764
but now that
you mention it...

144
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:49,274
Oh, Homer, you
grew up so handsome.

145
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,309
Some people say
I look like Dan Aykroyd.

146
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,895
I can't believe
you're here.

147
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,569
Dad always told me you died
while I was at the movies.

148
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,228
Oh, my poor baby.

149
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,398
You must have been so upset.

150
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,408
But I suppose Abe
has his reasons.

151
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,450
Yeah, well... where have you
been all this time?

152
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,294
Oh, it's a very
complicated story.

153
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,871
Let's just enjoy
this moment.

154
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,285
Mom, there's something
you should know about me.

155
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,335
I almost always
spoil the moment.

156
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,338
(burping)

157
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,672
I'm sorry.

158
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,427
That's okay, darling.

159
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,429
It wasn't your fault.

160
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,680
Hey, everybody, I got
a big surprise for you.

161
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,265
Presenting... my mother!

162
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,351
(gasps)

163
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,396
Your mother?
That's Grandma Simpson?

164
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,229
Can you
believe it?

165
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,324
I thought
she was dead.

166
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,319
Hello.

167
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,690
This is so weird.

168
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,436
It's like something
out of Dickens

169
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,898
or Melrose Place.

170
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,277
Where have you
been, Granny?

171
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,284
Did they freeze
you or something?

172
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,565
(laughing)

173
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,538
Oh, my,
such clever grandchildren.

174
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:54,038
So full of questions
and bright, shiny eyes.

175
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,622
I don't know what to say.

176
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,956
I finally have a mother-in-law.

177
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,581
(giggling)

178
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,958
No more living vicariously
through my girlfriends.

179
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,665
(giggles and coughs)

180
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,875
Hey.

181
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,335
Since you
were a no-show

182
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,045
at all the big
moments of my life,

183
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,545
you owe me years
of back presents.

184
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:13,347
Christmases, birthdays, Easters,
Kwanzas, good report cards...

185
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,443
Hmm. 75 bucks a pop
plus interest and penalties...

186
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,189
You owe me $22,000.

187
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,442
I'll Kwanza you!

188
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,363
Gaa! Gaa!

189
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,902
Homer, don't be so hard
on little...

190
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,526
(whispering)
What is his name?

191
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,992
This is my room.

192
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,912
This is my dresser.

193
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,531
It's where I keep my shirts
when I'm not wearing them.

194
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,077
Oh, yes,
right in the drawers.

195
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,582
(both laughing)

196
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,963
You remembered.

197
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:44,552
Oh, I've missed moments
like this... Mom.

198
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,420
I saw all
your awards, Lisa.

199
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,087
They're mighty impressive.

200
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,336
Oh, I just keep them
out to bug Bart.

201
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,598
Don't be bashful.

202
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,559
When I was your age,
kids made fun of me

203
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,559
because I read at
the ninth-grade level.

204
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,271
Me too!

205
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,481
Hey, Mom, look at me!

206
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,271
Look at what I can do!

207
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,364
I see you, Homer.

208
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,859
That's very nice.

209
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,780
Although I hardly consider
"A Separate Peace"

210
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,900
the ninth-grade level.

211
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,566
Yeah, more like preschool.

212
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,574
I hate John Knowles.

213
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,565
Me too.

214
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,276
(both laughing)

215
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,537
(both sighing)

216
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,210
Mom, you're not
looking!

217
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,289
You know, Lisa,
I feel like I have

218
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,464
an instant rapport with you.

219
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,843
(gasps)
You didn't dumb it down.

220
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,801
You said "rapport."

221
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,428
Got to run.
Grandma stuff.

222
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,765
Huh?

223
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,979
(turns dryer on)

224
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,810
There. Now no one should
be able to hear us.

225
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:41,805
What?

226
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,226
(turns dryer off)

227
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,234
All right, we don't
need the dryer.

228
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,265
What?!

229
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,318
Just shut up and listen.

230
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,281
There's something
fishy about Grandma.

231
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,412
Whenever we ask her where
she's been all this time

232
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,949
she changes the subject.

233
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,582
And just now when a
police car drove by

234
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,119
she ran into the house.

235
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,662
Yeah, I don't
trust her, either.

236
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:58,995
When I was going
through her purse

237
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,040
look what I found.

238
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,502
LISA:
"Mona Simpson."

239
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,832
"Mona Stevens."

240
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,087
"Martha Stewart."

241
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,338
"Penelope Olsen."

242
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,839
"Muddy Mae Suggins."

243
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,632
These are the calling cards
of a con artist.

244
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,800
Whoo-hoo!

245
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,596
I'm so glad
to have my Mom back.

246
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,100
I never realized
how much I missed her.

247
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,560
She's nice.

248
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,193
But?

249
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,940
I just don't think
you should get too excited

250
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,901
about the woman who
abandoned you for 25 years.

251
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,323
You could get hurt again.

252
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,071
First, it wasn't 25 years.

253
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,163
It was 27 years.

254
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,369
And second, she had
a very good reason.

255
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,489
Which was?

256
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,536
I don't know.

257
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,869
I guess I was
just a horrible son

258
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,495
(crying)
and no mother would want me.

259
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,922
Oh, Homie.

260
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,090
Come on, you're a sweet,
kind, loving man.

261
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,418
I'm sure you were
a wonderful son.

262
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,264
Then why did she leave me?

263
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,589
Let's find out.

264
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,350
Mother Simpson,
we'd like to ask you

265
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,099
a few questions
about your past.

266
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,720
Can't reminisce.
Sleeping.

267
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,177
(snoring)

268
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,555
Spill it, Muddy Mae,
or we're calling the cops.

269
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,055
Please don't.

270
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,647
Alright, then we'll call
your husband-- Grampa.

271
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,233
No! I'll talk.

272
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,358
I'll tell you everything.

273
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,954
I've wanted to tell you.

274
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,569
It all started in the '60s.

275
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,156
Take out wrenched ankle.

276
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,294
(buzzing)

277
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,830
Mom! Mom! Mom!

278
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,880
Oh, my little Homie Bear.

279
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,553
Time for bed.

280
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,720
Sing me my
bedtime song, Mom.

Abe, isn't Homer cute?

290
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,738
Probably. I'm trying
to watch the Super Bowl.

there's a haircut

where did your newfound sense

00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,494
of irresponsibility
take you?

308
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,247
I soon found people

00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,482
Ooh!

319
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,821

Wah!

359
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,696
(snorting)

360
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:50,697
Wah!

361
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:51,868
<i>From that moment on</i>

362
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,826
<i>my life as I knew it was over.</i>

363
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,287
<i>Only one member</i>

364
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,837
<i>of the Springfield Seven</i>
<i>was identified.</i>

365
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,840
<i>She's been described as a woman</i>

366
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,591
<i>in her early 30s</i>

367
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,473

369
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,637
Homer?

370
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,604
(sobbing)

371
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,687
I'll miss you, Homer.

372
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,897
I thought I dreamed that kiss.

373
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,356
(sniffling)

374
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,906
I'm so sorry
I misjudged you, Mom.

375
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,201
You had to leave
to protect your family.

376
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,825
How did you survive?

377
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,081
Oh, I had help from
my friends in the underground.

378
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,753
Jerry Rubin
gave me a job

379
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,712
marketing his line
of health shakes.

380
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,752
I proofread Bobby
Seale's cookbook

381
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,166
and I ran credit checks

382
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,634
at Tom Hayden's
Porsche dealership.

383
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,174
Wait a minute.

384
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,217
There's one thing
I don't understand.

385
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,601
In all those years, why didn't
you ever try to contact me?

386
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,969
But I did.

387
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,885
I sent you a care package
every week.

388
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,774
Aw come on, Mom.
We use that same line

389
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,311
on the kids
when they're at camp.

390
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,814
But I did. I really did.

391
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,766
I'll prove it to you.

392
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,986
Any undelivered mail
for Homer J. Simpson?

393
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,528
No... oh, wait. This.

394
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,283
That's what happens

395
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,914
when you don't tip your
letter carrier at Christmas.

396
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,371
Yes, I'd like to send
this letter

397
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,911
to the Prussian consulate
in Siam by aeromail.

398
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,155
Am I too late
for the 4:30 auto-gyro?

399
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,537
Uh... I better look
in the manual.

400
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,995
Oh, the ignorance.

401
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,455
Wait a minute.

402
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,376
I know that woman.

403
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,375
But from when,

404
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,966
and in what capacity?

405
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,012
(gasping)

406
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,014
It's her.

407
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,135
At last.

408
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,891
This book must
be out of date.

409
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,893
I don't see Prussia,
Siam or auto-gyro.

410
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,476
Well, keep looking.

411
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,101
(gasps)

412
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,936
Are you sure this is the woman
you saw in the Post Office?

413
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,197
Absolutely.

414
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,198
Who could forget
such a monstrous visage?

415
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,529
She has the sloping brow

416
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,914
and cranial bumpage
of the career criminal.

417
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,281
Uh, sir, phrenology
was dismissed

418
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,908
as quackery
160 years ago.

419
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,504
Of course,
you'd say that

420
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,869
You have the brainpan
of a stagecoach tilter.

421
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,787
At any rate, the F.B.I.
will track down

422
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,585
this mystery woman
and put her behind bars.

423
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,797
How does it happen, Joe?

424
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:06,801
How does what
happen?

425
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,302
How does a sweet young lady

426
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,014
mortgage her future for
a bunch of scraggly ideals

427
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,175
and greasy-haired promises?

428
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,933
Maybe she thought the war on
southeast Asia was so immoral

429
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,345
her end justified the means.

430
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,693
Gee, Joe, you haven't
been the same

431
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,059
since your son went
crazy in Vietnam.

432
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,186
It's a pain that never ends.

Oh, Abe.
You've aged terribly.

What do you expect?

453
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,243

have to tell Homer I was dead!

or tell him

a wanted criminal.

00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,309

I suddenly make
a lot of sense.

She seemed like a nice lady.

483

Well, that "nice lady"

set the cause of biological
warfare back 30 years.

485
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,566
We're only now
finally caught up.

486

Two more ladies come by
earlier that day.

487
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,743
One was real pretty.

T'other, sort of plain.

your assistance

Oh, you're fresh.

492

Don't you want to play

493

Ma'am, we're all good cops.

494

of playing the good cop.

visited that tombstone.

But bring back some
of them, uh, gyros.

Uh, Chief, you're talking
into your wallet.

ever thought

511

to Springfield?

There's nothing to be
alarmed about,

520
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,444
but could you take one
last look at the family

521
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,523
and join me in the kitchen?

00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,273
(panting)
Sir...

536
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,355
she's gone.

537
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,652
We made it, Homer.

538
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,857
It's all thanks
to our anonymous tipster.

539
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,078
But who are you
and why did you tip us off?

540
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,249
<i>Well, it's 'cause of your</i>
<i>old lady that I got rid</i>

541
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,748
<i>of the asthma that was</i>
<i>keeping me out of the academy.</i>

542
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,080
Thanks.

543
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,535
Sure. Just think of me
as an anonymous friend

544
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,206
who rose through the ranks
of the Springfield Police

545
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,835
to become
Chief Clancy Wig...

546
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:57,922
(dial tone)

547
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,506
Yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak.

548
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,930
(horn beeping)

549
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,851
Well, there's my ride.

550
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,890
The underground awaits.

551
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,274
(sniffling) At least this time
I'm awake for your good-bye.

552
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,772
(sniffing)
Oh, Homer.

553
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,904
Remember: whatever happens,

554
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,192
you have a mother

555
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,565
and she's truly
proud of you.

556
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,121
Oh...

557
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,448
Oh! Hurry up, man.

558
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,504
This electric van only has
20 minutes of juice left.

559
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,785
Don't forget me.

560
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:32,923
Don't worry, Homer.

561
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,040
You'll always be a part of me.

562
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,207
D'oh!

563
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,648

564
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,398
