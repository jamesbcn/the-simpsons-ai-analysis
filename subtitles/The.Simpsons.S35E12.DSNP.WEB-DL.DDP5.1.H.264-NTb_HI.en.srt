Oh, Paolo love! Boof!

173
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,246
In a setback
to their jet-setting lifestyles,

They didn't.

179

make stuff happen around here.

191
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,176

Bartolomeo,
you make Paolo so happy. [sobs]

{\an8}The kids never check the legs.

Now, honey, I know they're going fast,
but I'm sure Lisa's safe.

212
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,159
There's nothing to worry about.

213
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,370
Oh, I'm not worried.

214
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,163
Come on. You gotta be a little worried.

215
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,832
Nope. I've seen Lisa race a dozen times.

216
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,752
She's really good, and she's safe.

217

But-But you're
the family's designated worrier.

218

If you're not worried,
that means there's a worry vacuum

- Yes.

Well, I've never met her before,

a bunch of crazy stuff from <i>Mario Kart</i>.

You never cared about that
when you were driving like a maniac.

Well, through some miracle of therapy,
I'm in the driver's seat now,

No, I'm in control.

[both arguing in Italian]

343
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,598
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday!

344
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:43,770
Bart, you break my heart
like snap the breadstick.

345
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,980
Boof.

347
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,028
You're not watching the race?

348
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,863
I'm too worried about Lisa.

349
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,156
My only daughter...

350
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,240
Uh, there's Maggie.

351
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,077
...is rocketing around
on a flaming death-mobile!

352
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,829
Why does no one else care
about Lisa's safety?

353
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,414
She's fine. See?

[announcer] <i>From the pole position,</i>

355
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,752
<i>Lisa Simpson
immediately takes the initiative.</i>

356
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,214
What's "initiative"? Why does she have it?
Is it safe?

357
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,381
[phone beeps]

358
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,008
Stupid Team Dooshé.

359
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,096
Those Euro jerks forgot
to remove me from their text thread.

360
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,306
{\an8}"Sabotaggio"?

361
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,641
Sabotaggio?

362
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,185
Ooh. Is that some kind
of delicious, spiced ham?

363
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,771
It means they sabotaged Lisa's kart!

364
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,773
Oh, God. I knew she was in danger.

365
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,944
My overreacting is now just...
[gasps] ...reacting.

366
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,905
[announcer] <i>It's the final lap

370
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,666
You loosened all the bolts
on Lisa's kart. Boof.

{\an8}[announcer] <i>We have contact!</i>

372
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,385
In the storm, I am the calm at the center.

373
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:03,142
{\an8}Why is her wheel not falling off?

374
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,725

{\an8}- Okay. Missing a wheel. No brakes.
- [squealing]

378
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,651
- Still in control.
- [metal clanks]

379
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,446
Okay. Now I'm not in control,
but still calm.

380
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,449
Wow. I have a great therapist.

381
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,286
She's gonna die!

382
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,668
Marge, I learned my lesson.
I was right! Lisa's not safe!

383

[shrieks, speaking Italian]

384
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,970
Dad!

385
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,054
Don't worry, sweetie.

386
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:45,057
I'm gonna get you out of this mess
the way I got you into this mess.

387
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,936
By driving like a maniac!

388
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,106
Stay behind me!

{\an8}Aw, you're brake checking me.

391
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:00,240
But now I'm brake checking with love.

392
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:08,247
{\an8}[screams] I lose! This sport is <i>stupido</i>.

393
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:14,837
{\an8}And now I fade away to Ibiza,
to a quiet life as a beach deejay.

394
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:15,964
{\an8}Boof.

395
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,386
Dad, thank you. You've made me feel safe.

396
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,224
And I always will.
