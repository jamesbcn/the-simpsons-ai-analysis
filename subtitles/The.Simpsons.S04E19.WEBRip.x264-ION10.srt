you bought for the bathroom.

Oh, my God.

00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,225
<i>No, the other secret.</i>

71
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,442
Marge, I never graduated
from high school.

72
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,573
That still doesn't explain
why you ate my soap.

73
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,652
Wait, maybe it does.

74
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,487
I never passed
Remedial Science 1A.

75
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,033
And you're a nuclear technician?

78
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,171
I don't know.
I flunked Latin too.

instead of shampoo,

92
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,003
Itchy covers Scratchy's hair
with Bar-B-Q sauce.

93
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,381
<i>Opens a box</i>

100
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,402

is put our names on it.

101
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,519

put my name first.

102
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:16,726
No way.

103
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,526
All right,
then to decide it

104
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,609
I propose a race
around the world.

105
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,155
Meet me at Leicester Square
at noon tomorrow.

106
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,239
The queen herself shall
drop the checkered flag.

107
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,616
Look, there's only
one reasonable way

108
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,792
to settle this.

109
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,910
Rock, paper, scissors.

110
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,827
<i>Poor predictable Bart.</i>

111
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,785

<i>Good old rock.</i>

113
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,125
<i>Nothing beats that.</i>

114
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,424
-Rock.
-Paper.

115
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,466

take off your underwear

157

158
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,147

188
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,426
So many memories.

189
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,352
Time to go to the reunion.

190
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,770
It will be great to see
the old gang again.

191
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,479
Potsie, Ralph Malph, the Fonz.

192
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,311
That was "Happy Days."

193
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,766
No, they weren't all happy days.

194
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,647
Like the time Pinky Tuscadero
crashed her motorcycle

195
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,525
or the night I lost all
my money to those cardsharps

196
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,993
and my dad, Tom Bosley,
had to get it back.

197
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,704
(groans)

198
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,709
Hello,
Principal Dondalinger.

199
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,960
Oh, Marge Bouvier,
it's so good to see you.

200
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,542
Sorry, sir.

201
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,797
We're not letting vagrants
sleep in the gym tonight

202
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,629
but we will be putting some
scraps by the back door.

203
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,375
-D'oh!
-Oh, it's you, Simpson.

204
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,387
Eech.

205
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:19,349
Look. There's Bobby Mindich,
the class clown.

206
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,643
I am not a crook.

207
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,187

208
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,521
Richard Nixon.

209
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,515

Hello, Marge.
Have you heard?

216
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,543
I'm stinking rich.
Jealous?

217
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:45,712
I'll bet you'd trade it all
for one night with my wife.

218
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,253
I would.

219

Hey, man, it's Dave.

222
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,344
Open up, man.

223
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,505
Dave's not here, man.

The guy's so high

227
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,943
he doesn't even
know that's Dave.

228
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,349
Homer. Homer?

229
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,108
Homer's not here, man.

230
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,979
Okay. Very good.

233
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,113
-Ed Sullivan.
-Shh.

234
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:18,116
First, the award for the alumnus
who's gained the most weight.

235
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,240
-Homer Simpson.
-Oh, my God!

236
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,698
How did you do it, Homer?

237
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:25,707
I discovered a meal
between breakfast and brunch.

238
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,501
And now, the award
for most improved odor.

239
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,246
Homer Simpson.

240
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,088
Yes!

241
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:36,093
And the person who traveled
the least distance to be here--

242
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,717
(southern accent)
Well, kiss my grits.

243
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,144
Homer Simpson.

244
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,643
What can I say?

245
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,095
It hasn't been easy
staying in my rut.

246
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,896
Class of '74

247
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,979
I was just leafing through
your permanent records

248
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,726
when I discovered
something shocking.

249
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,817
Homer Simpson never passed
Remedial Science 1A

250
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,244
and thus never graduated
from high school.

251
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,122
(gasping)

252
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,739
I'm sorry, Simpson, I'm gonna
have to take back those awards.

253
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,076
(laughter)

254
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,248
This is Howard Cosmell.

255
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,546
Homer Simpson is a boob.

256
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,260
What do you think, J.J.?

257
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,051
Dyno-mite!

258
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,224
Didn't graduate?

259
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,222
How low can you get?

260
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,354
Barney, where's
your cummerbund?

261
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,231
It fell in the toilet.

262
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,350
Marge, I have my pride.

263
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,307
I'm going to go
to night school,

264
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,108
earn my high school diploma

265
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,491
and get back my
"most improved odor" trophy.

266
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,778
Mmm.

267
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,151

268
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,778

269
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:39,874

a good writer looks like.

279
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,635
His name is Abraham Simpson,
and he's got something

280
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
you couldn't get
at your fancy schools--

281
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,425
Life experience.

282
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,435
Actually, I wrote my thesis
on life experience and--

283
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,688
Quiet!

284
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,269
Abe, tell them about
your amazing life.

285
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,895
I spent 40 years
as a night watchman

286
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,323
at a cranberry silo.

287
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,031
Wow!

288
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:21,241

releases nicotine into my body

00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,176
our animators will reuse
the same backgrounds

360
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,385
over and over
and over again.

361
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,277
Welcome to Remedial Science 1A.

362
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,163
My wife recently passed away.

363
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,529
I thought teaching
might ease my loneliness.

364
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,907
Will this be on the test?

365
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,623
-No.
-Oh.

366
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,287
Hey, Mel, bring
me another nicotine patch.

367
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,285
I think there's some space
on my butt.

368
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,298
And now here's another fine
Itchy & Scratchy cartoon

369
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,631
by Abraham Simpson.

370
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,126
ALL: Yay!

371
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,732
(screaming)

372
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,017
(screaming)

373
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,429
Now I'm going to burn
this doughnut to show you

374
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,143
how many calories
it has.

375
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,813
No!

376
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,391
The bright blue flame
indicates this was

377
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,517
a particularly
sweet doughnut.

378
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,193
(sobbing)

379
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,692
This is not happening.

380
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,443
This is not happening.

381
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,605
ABE: Dear Mr. President:

382
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,954
There are too many
states nowadays.

383
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,701
Please eliminate three.

384
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,782
I am not a crackpot.

385
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,908
Good news, Abe.

386
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,374
Who are you?

387
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,044
No, no, you've been
nominated for an award.

388
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,383
You're so good,
I fired the other writers.

389
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,289
From now on, the fate
of the entire company

390
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,297
rests on that delightful
coconut of yours.

391
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,550
Oh, no,
we're all doomed.

392
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,512
I'm a complete fraud.

393
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,683
Sorry, I didn't catch
any of that.

394
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,722
And now I got to go.

395
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,805
All right,
here are your exams.

396
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,942
50 questions,
true or false.

397
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,149
True.

398
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,858
Homer, I was just
describing the test.

399
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,318
-True.
-Look, Homer,

400
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,858
just take the test
and you'll do fine.

401
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:48,861
False.

402
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,029
All right, brain,

403
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,032
you don't like me,
and I don't like you

404
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,704
but let's just do this

405
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,413
and I can get back
to killing you with beer.

406
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,294
<i>It's a deal.</i>

407
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,582
Thank you for this award.

408
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,825
It is a tribute
to this great country

409
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,128
that a man who once took
a shot at Teddy Roosevelt

410
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,763
could win back your trust.

411
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,339
Yo, Grandpa,
time for the awards.

412
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,434
Did you call the girl
from the escort service?

413
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,641
They said their insurance
won't cover you.

414
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,681
That's an onion
in the ointment.

415
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,436
ANNOUNCER:
<i>And now to present the award</i>

416
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,194
<i>for outstanding writing</i>
<i>in a cartoon series,</i>

417
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,695
<i>Krusty the Clown</i>
<i>and Brooke Shields.</i>

418
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,533
Well, here we are--.

419
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:43,076
The star of "The Blue Lagoon"
and me, the blue-haired goon.

420
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,503
What the--

421
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,331
That's terrible.

422
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,626
Cartoons have the power to make
us laugh and to make us cry.

423
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,421
Wouldn't you agree,
Krusty?

424
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,875
First of all,
my hair is green, not blue.

425
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,337
I got nothing to work
with here. Nothing.

426
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,677
Uh--

427
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,932
Well, at least I can
take off this girdle.

428
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,175
(grunting)

429
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,687
Oh, yeah.

430
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,650
The nominees for best writing
in a cartoon series are:

431
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,322
Strongdar, Master of Acom.

432
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,361
"The Wedding" episode.

433
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,658
Action Figure Man.

434
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,329
The "How to Buy
Action Figure Man" episode.

435
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:24,119
<i>Please, Mommy,</i>
<i>I want it.</i>

436
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,174
<i>Hmm--</i>

437
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,417
Ren and Stimpy.
Season premiere.

438
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,470
And finally,
Itchy & Scratchy.

439
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,679
The "Little Barber Shop
of Horrors" episode.

440
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,259
Cross my fingers for me.

441
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,644
(cracking)

442
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,681
That's gonna hurt
come winter.

443
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,143
(screaming)

444
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,975
(giggling)

445
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:55,145
And the winner is--

446
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,485
"Itchy & Scratchy.

447
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,110
Abraham Simpson,
writer."

448
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,735
BART:
All right, Grandpa, whoo!

449
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,866
That was the first time
I ever saw Itchy & Scratchy

450
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,126
and I didn't like it one bit.

451
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,669
It was disgusting and violent.

452
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,553
I think all you people
are despicable.

453
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,301
For shame!

454
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,762
(grumbling)

455
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,558
He's right. We've been
wasting our lives.

456
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,019
The hell with cartoons.

457
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,018
I'm gonna do
what I've always dreamed of.

458
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,140
I want to write that sitcom
about the sassy robot.

459
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,228
Here, kids, I guess
you deserve this.

460
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,864
Let's go.

461
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,031
LISA: I guess nobody likes
the truth, huh, Grandpa?

462
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,570
Nope.

463
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,784
BART: I'll never watch
an awards show again

464
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:44,204
unless that delightful
Billy Crystal is involved.

465
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,084
Marge, I passed!

466
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,411
That's wonderful, Homie.

467
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,327
At our next high school reunion

468
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,825
I'll have nothing
to be ashamed of.

469
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,434
Hello, Dondalinger.

470
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,550
Simpson, is that a plunger
stuck on your head?

471
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,675
D'oh!

472
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,766

It's time for church.

We're not going to church today.
