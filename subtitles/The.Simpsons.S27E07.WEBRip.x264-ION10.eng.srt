I said fade!

352
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:33,184
Everyone, meet me back here
in however long it takes

353
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,675
to wake up from five Valium.

354
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,977
On the dot!

355
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,520
(horns honking)

356
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,272
Hey, man, how'd you get that seat?

357
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,688
They thought I was pregnant.

358
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,699
(indistinct chatter)

359
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,369
It's showtime, Laney.
Time to see if there's still a spark left

360
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,504
in that smoldering Duraflame log
you call a career.

361
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,252
Hey, Laney.

362
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,995
Moe, I need you.

363
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,167
To make me feel confident,
strong and beautiful.

364
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,626
Boy, I'm not real good
at boosting self-esteem there.

365
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,427
But, uh, if you make a mistake,
I can fire my gun.

366
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,562
And that's what the critics
will be yappin' about tomorrow.

367
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,599
(chuckles)

368
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,612
That's not encouragement!

369
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,650
Those are your lyrics!

370
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,573
-(applause, piano playing)

380

(crowd cheering)

381
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,940
Cheering for someone
getting a word right.

382
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,519
That is a low bar.

383
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,523
(panting)

384
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,814
Four tickets, please.

385
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,687
I'm sorry, ma'am.
The show is sold out

386
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,694
for reasons that elude me.

387
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,186
My daughter's in there.

388
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,608
Eh, we all got our problems.

389
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,736
I'm a ticket seller
for a dying art form.

390
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:17,704
Hey, uh, you're a union man, right?

391
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,366
Brother?

392
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,655
Why didn't you say so?

393
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,958
I have no choice now but to be corrupt.

394
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,212
In you go.

395
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,297

(crowd cheering)

399
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,017
Come on, let's sneak her out.

400
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,980
Under the guise of soliciting
for Broadway Cares.

401
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,112
(coins jingling)

402
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,938
Wait. Wait, Homer.

403
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,685
Look at our little girl.
She's got chops.

404
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,908
Honest-to-goodness chops.

405
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,738
Yeah.
Letting our daughter go on the road

406
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,494
with an 80-year-old diva
and some sketchy jazz guys

407
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,367
was the best decision
we ever made.

408
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:05,165

(whoops)

412
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,484
Mom,
that was the greatest night of my life!

413
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,639
MILHOUSE:
Hey!

414
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,647
When does the show start?

415
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,149
It did, and it was wonderful.

416
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,732
Eh, she's been bitten
by the showbiz bug.

417
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,198
And when that happens,
only working with Bruce Willis

418
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,448
can extinguish it.

419
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,742
(giggles)

420
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,195
(sighs)
Okay. Just finish out the tour.

421
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,785
We'll see you in Pittsfield.

422
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,417
No way!

423
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,013
Pittsfield ain't happening
for this little scene stealer.

424
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,089
I love you, Lisa,
but you got a bigger ovation than me.

425
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,505
So we can never
share the same stage again.

426
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,604
What? How can you say that?

427
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,600
Showbiz lesson
number seven:

428
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,562
just when things are going great,

429
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,562
they pull the rug
out from under you.

430
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,404
Bad news, Laney.
We're shutting down.

431
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,069
Never cleared the rights
to "Everything's Coming Up Roses."

432
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,229
See what I mean?

433
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,146
Also, we're gonna need that rug.

434
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,025
-(grunts)
-(shouts)

435
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,203
(sniffles)

436
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,281
Mom,
suddenly I really want to go home.

437
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,286
Oh. Mm.

438
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,748
If you go,
let me give you one huge piece of advice:

439
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,420
take the Eighth Avenue side,

440
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,458
then catch a cab and circle back.

441
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,422
And away... I... go!

442
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,382
(scatting)
Pow!

443
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:37,633
Well, Laney, youse, uh...
you still got me.

444
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,638
{\an8}♪ ♪

445
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,163

446
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,162
See how gaudy his house is?

447
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,214
A brass doorknocker?

448
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,288

00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,552
I see thou art still using
the Devil's "diddly."

452
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,221
Well, I must confess, I-I do over-diddly.

453
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,300
And I see your house
is lit by Edison's witch lights.

454
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:25,176
(chuckles)
Who's holier than thou now, Ned?

455
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,345
Homer, you've shown me
that I'm guilty of the sin of pride,

456
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,845
and that just makes me love you more.

457
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,898
Oh, God, I'm stuck in a Flandwich.

458
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,822

459
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,991
