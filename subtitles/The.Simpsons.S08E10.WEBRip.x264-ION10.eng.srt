{\an8}Hello. I'm Leonard Nimoy.

13
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,416
{\an8}The following tale
of alien encounters is true

14
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,218
{\an8}and by true, I mean false.

15
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:37,722
{\an8}It's all lies,
but they're entertaining lies,

16
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,886
{\an8}and in the end,
isn't that the real truth?

17
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:44,265
{\an8}The answer is "no."

18
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,524
{\an8}Our story begins
on a friday morning

19
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:50,356
{\an8}in a little town
called Springfield.

20
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,493
{\an8}T.G.I.F., guys.
I'm off to Moe's.

21
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,281
{\an8}But, Homer, it's 10:00
in the morning.

22
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,825
{\an8}Don't worry, I have a plan.

23
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,368
{\an8}I saw this in a movie

24
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,791
{\an8}about a bus that had
to "speed" around a city

25
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,040
{\an8}keeping its "speed" over 50

26
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,253
{\an8}and if its "speed" dropped,
it would explode.

27
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,094
{\an8}I think it was called...

28
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,259
{\an8}"The Bus That Couldn't
Slow Down."

29
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:15,179
{\an8}First, I hook this common VCR
into the security camera system

30
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,930
{\an8}like so...

31
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:20,221
{\an8}then I insert this old
videotape of us working

32
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,096
{\an8}on a continuous loop.

33
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,597
(no audible dialogue)

34
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,784
{\an8}So, another
Friday is upon us.

35
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,488
{\an8}What'll you be
doing, Smithers?

36
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,038
{\an8}Something gay, no doubt.

37
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,621
{\an8}Wha...? What?!

38
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,416
{\an8}You know,
lighthearted, fancy-free.

39
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,169
{\an8}Mothers, lock up
your daughters.

40
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,131
{\an8}Smithers is
on the town.

41
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,761
{\an8}(laughing)
Exactly, sir.

00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,471
It's Friday.

45
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,144
Uh-oh. Wrong pills.

46
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,943
Uh... little help?

47
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,654
Sorry, Donkey Kong.

48
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,695
You're just not
a draw anymore.

49
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,196
Hey, he's still got it.

50
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:25,617
MILHOUSE:
...38, 39, 40 quarters.

51
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,825
This better be good.

52
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,303
<i>Game over.</i>
<i>Please deposit 40 quarters.</i>

53
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,419

a little older

you'll learn that Friday's
just another day

between NBC's
"Must-See Thursday"

68
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,758
and CBS's "Saturday
Night Craparama."

69
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,803
Another Duff, Homer?

70
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,007
Nah. It's Friday
night, Moe.

71
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,598
I want to
try something special.

72
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,393
Uh, sure, sure.

73
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,096
Eh, here you go.

74
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,436
"Doof-uh."
From Sweden.

75
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,482
Skoal!

76
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,775
Wait a minute.
This is Duff.

77
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,279
(laughing)

78
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,491
You got me, didn't you?

79
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,240
All right, here you go--
Red tick beer.

80
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,334
Hmm.
Bold, refreshing.

81
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,791
And something I can't
quite put my finger on.

82
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,632
(barking)

83
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,299
Hmm... needs more dog.

(snoring)

85
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,836
Well, it's 1:00 A.M.
Better go home

86
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,045
and spend some quality time
with the kids.

87
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,386
Just a second, Homer.

88
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,060
You got to take
a breathalyzer test

89
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,469
before I let you drive home.

00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,704

and I got lost.

111

-Homer, it's 2:00 A.M.

112
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,134
-What happened?
-It was an alien, Marge.

113
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,248
It appeared in front of me
and said, "Don't be afraid."

114
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,336
Have you been
drinking?

115
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,551
No... Well, ten beers.

HOMER: I'm telling you

118

I saw a creature
from another planet.

119
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,764
Maybe you just dreamed it.

120
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,806
Oh, yeah?
Well, when I came to

121
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,929
I was covered with
a sticky translucent goo.

122
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,266
Explain that.

123
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,101
-More sausage?
-(drooling)

124
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,817
{\an8}Dad, according to
"Junior Skeptic Magazine,"

125
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,358
{\an8}the chances are
175 million to one

126
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,863
{\an8}of another form of life actually
coming in contact with ours.

127
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,406
-So?
-It's just that

128
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,869
the people who claim
they've seen aliens

129
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,869
are always pathetic lowlifes
with boring jobs.

130
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,752
Oh, and you, Dad.

131
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,290
(chuckles weakly)

132
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,036
I am the thing from Uranus.

Oh, it's Bart.

135
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,553
I can't believe it.

136
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,261
I'm being mocked
by my own children.

137
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,012
On my birthday.

138
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,144
-It's your birthday?
-Yes.

139
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,431
Remember, it's the same day
as the dog's.

140
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,765
{\an8}Santa's Little Helper,
it's your birthday?

141
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,351
{\an8}Ooh, we've got to
get you a present.

142
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,897
{\an8}Yes, we do.
Yes, we do.

143
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,441
{\an8}We love you, boy.

144
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,694
{\an8}Good doggy. Good doggy.

145
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,487
Lousy lovable dog.

146
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,370
Oh, it was awful.

147
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,949
They set me
on a cold metal table,

148
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,325
and prodded me
with humiliating probes, and--

149
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,213
Oh, wait.
That was my physical.

150
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,290
(men scoff)

151
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,964
Great story, Homer,
really.

152
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,053
The alien has
a sweet heavenly voice...

153
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,459
Like Urkel.

154
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,467
And he appears
every Friday night...

155
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,930
Like Urkel.

156
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,890
Well, your story
is very compelling,

157
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,471
Mr. Jackass.
I mean, uh, Simpson.

158
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:40,267
So I'll just type it up
on my invisible typewriter.

159
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,483
(humming)

160
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,444
(sighs) You don't have
to humiliate me.

161
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,323
I just torched
a building downtown

162
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,525
and I'm afraid
I'll do it again.

163
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,325
Oh, yeah, right.

164
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,538
I'll just type it up on
my invisible typewriter.

165
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,250
(humming)

166
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,417
Fruitcake.

167
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,927
Look at this, Scully.

168
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,595
There's been another
unsubstantiated U.F.O. sighting

169
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,351
in the heartland
of America.

170
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,732
We've got to get there
right away.

171
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,349
Well, gee, Mulder,

172
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,305
there's also this report
of a shipment of drugs

173
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,476
and illegal weapons coming
into New Jersey tonight.

174
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,185
(scoffs) I hardly think
the F.B.I.'s concerned

175
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,436
with matters like that.

176
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,700
Hello. Can I help you?

177
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,913
{\an8}Agents Mulder
and Scully-- F.B.I.

178
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,624
(gasps)
Is this about that pen

179
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,214
that I took
from the post office?

180
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,829
I-I swear, I didn't know
I put it in my purse.

181
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,126
Then I was going to bring it back
but the dog chewed it up,

182
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,050
and that just made things worse.
(hyperventilating)

183
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,590
Actually, we're here to see your husband
about his U.F.O. encounter.

184
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:56,715
Oh... come...
come in.

185
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,433
SCULLY: Mr. Simpson,
look at this lineup

186
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,807
and tell us if any of these are
the aliens you saw.

187
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,484
Yo.

188
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,154
No, I'm sorry.

189
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,942
(all grumbling)

190
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,737
{\an8}Oh, this makes me
very angry.

191
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,025
Now we're going
to run a few tests.

192
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,115
This is
a simple lie detector.

193
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,830
I'll ask you a few
"yes" or "no" questions,

194
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,000
and you just
answer truthfully.

195
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,578
Do you understand?

196
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,583
Yes.

197
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,300
Ow.

198
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,505
(panting)

199
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,806
Wait a minute, Scully.
What's the point of this test?

200
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,310
No point.
I just thought

201
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,981
he could stand to lose
a little weight.

202
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,400
His jiggling
is almost hypnotic.

203
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,609
Yes, it's like
a lava lamp.

204
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,406
MULDER:
All right, Homer,

205
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,993
we want you re-create
your every move

206
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,038
the night you
saw this alien.

207
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,371
Well, the evening began
at the gentleman's club,

208
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,377
where we were
discussing Wittgenstein

209
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,629
over a game
of backgammon.

210
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,881
Mr. Simpson,
it's a felony

211
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,512
to lie
to the F.B.I.

212
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,379
We were sitting in Barney's car
eating packets of mustard.

213
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,506
You happy?

214
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:21,683
You are one
fine-looking woman, lady.

215
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,524
If I wasn't married,

216
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,229
I'd go out with you
like that.

217
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,518
I am so sorry.

218
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,016
Whatever you do,
don't tell Marge.

219
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,568
God, I love her.

220
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,531
I... Hey, a penny.

221
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,031
So, who are you guys anyhow?

222
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,204
Agents Mulder and Scully--

223
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,911
F.B.I.

224
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:41,991
F.B.I., huh?

225
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,326
Uh, excuse me.

226
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,080
All right, they're onto us.

227
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,543
Get him back to Sea World.

228
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:51,003
(vocalizing)

229
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:54,255
So I says,
"Blue M&M, red M&M.

230
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:57,338
They all wind up
the same color in the end."

231
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,215
Homer, why don't you
show us where you went

232
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,681
when you left the bar.

233
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,761
I was standing
right here

234
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,847
when the horrible creature
emerged from the woods.

235
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,194
For the love of God, help me!

236
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,561
I've been here for four days,

237
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,727
and a turtle's
got a hold of my teeth.

238
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,776
There he is.

239
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,401
Come back here, you.

240
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,607
Slow down.
I'll get you.

241
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,198
This is the worst
assignment we've ever had.

242
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,536
Worse than the time

243
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,120
we were attacked by
the flesh-eating virus?

244
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,746
Ow! He bit me
with my own teeth!

245
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,625
No, this is much
more irritating.

246
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,382
I've seen enough, Mulder.
Let's go.

247
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,844
Yeah, okay.

248
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,053
But somewhere out there,
something is watching us.

249
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,304
There are alien forces

250
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,295
acting in ways
we can't perceive.

251
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,847
Are we alone
in the universe?

252
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,720
Impossible, when you
consider the wonders

253
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,177
that exist around us.

254
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,687
...voodoo priests of Haiti,

255
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,939
the Tibetan numerologists
of Appalachia,

256
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,571
the unsolved mysteries
of "Unsolved Mysteries."

257
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,739
The truth is out there.

258
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:01,158
(Moe grunting)

259
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:04,028
Who would have thought
a whale could be so heavy?

260
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,326
(gasps)
Cheese it. The Feds.

261
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,200
(whale vocalizes)

262
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,537
Oh, Marge,
I've never felt so alone.

263
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,673
No one believes me.

264
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,630
Uh, this is the part where
you're supposed to say

265
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:16,801
"I believe you, Homer."

266
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,419
I don't believe
you, Homer.

267
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:22,046
You do? Oh, Marge,
you've made me so happy.

268
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,184
Mmm, you're not listening.

269
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,221
You're only hearing
what you want to hear.

270
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,555
Thanks. I'd love
an omelet right about now.

271
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,641
Homer, please,
I try to be supportive,

272
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,647
but this has gone too far.

273
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,019
Please just let it be.

274
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,476
No, I can't.
This is my cause.

275
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,237
I'm like the man who
singlehandedly built the rocket

276
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,699
and went to the moon.

277
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,659
What was his name,
Apollo Creed?

278
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,829
Please, let's
just go to sleep.

279
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,618
No, I refuse to share a bed
with someone who thinks I'm crazy.

280
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,253
Unless you're feeling amorous.

281
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,001
-(purrs)
-No, I'm not.

282
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,843
Well, then, good night.

283
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,258
Hey, Dad, what's the word
from planet crackpot?

284
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,588
Oh, I suppose
you're going to mock me too.

285
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,304
Well, actually, Dad,
I believe you.

286
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,385
-You do?
-Yes, I do.

287
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,140
You seem so damn sure.

288
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,602
Thank you, son.

289
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,432
And do you think you could
stop the casual swearing?

290
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,347
-Hell, yes.
-That's my boy.

291
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,595
Well, if you
believe in me

292
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,937
then I'm not
going to give up.

293
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,361
I'll prove I'm right.

294
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,189
This Friday we're
going back to the woods

295
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,145
and we're going
to find that alien.

296
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,485
What if we don't?

297
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,110
We'll fake it and sell
it to the Fox network.

298
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,987
(chuckles)
They'll buy anything.

299
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:31,195
Now, son, they do a lot
of quality programming too.

300
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,326
(laughing)

301
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,379
I kill me.

302
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,088
-Bud...
-weis...

303
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,422
er.

304
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,627
-Bud...
-weis...

305
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,627
er.

306
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,968
Coors.

307
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,764
Yo, Dad, can I have a sip
of your beer?

308
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,847
Now, son, you don't
want to drink beer.

309
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,602
That's for daddies
and kids with fake I.D.s.

310
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,185
Besides, it's such
a beautiful night.

311
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,271
How about a ghost story?

312
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:03,646
...and that is how much
college will cost for Maggie.

313
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,406
No. No! No!

314
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,528
You know, Dad,

315
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,578
it doesn't matter that
we didn't see the alien.

316
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,121
I really had
a great time out here.

317
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,424
Yeah, me too.

318
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,748
-("The X-Files Theme" playing)
-(gasps) It's him!

319
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,092
I bring you peace.

320
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,256
As a representative
of planet Earth,

321
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,427
let me be the first to say--

322
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,345
(screaming)

323
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,731
(gasps)

324
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,727
D'oh! It's gone.

325
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,895
And we still
don't have any proof.

326
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:44,994
Oh, yes, we do.

327
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,989
I got it all on tape.

328
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,241
Good work, son!

329
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,582
We did it!
We did it!

330
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,329
And so, from this
simple man came the proof

331
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,003
that we are not alone
in the universe.

332
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,423
I'm Leonard Nimoy.

333
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,961
Good night.

334
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,804
MAN: Uh, Mr. Nimoy, we
have ten minutes left.

335
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,841
Oh... fine.

336
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:13,215
Well, let me just get,
uh, something out of my car.

337
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,175
(footsteps running)

338
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,475
(tires screeching)

339
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,399
I don't think
he's coming back.

362
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,412
Well, Lis, what do you
think about the alien now?

363
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,666
I think there must be a
more logical explanation

364
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,209
and I think the people of this town
aren't going to be won over

365
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,503
by three seconds
of videotape.

366
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,707
(doorbell rings)

367
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,511
Uh... I'm happy to
answer any questions

368
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,763
you have about the alien.
Any questions at all.

369
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,385
Dr. Hibbert?

370
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,482
Yes, is the alien carbon-based
or silicon-based?

371
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,888
Uh... the second one.

372
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,517
Zilliphone.
Next question.

373
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,864
Is the alien Santa Claus?

374
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,149
Uh... yes.

375
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,322
Uh, were you on my roof
last night

376
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,401
stealing my weather vane?

377
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,777
This interview is over.

378
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,825
I remember another gentle
visitor from the heavens.

379
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,081
He came in peace,
and then died,

380
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,083
only to
come back to life.

381
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,206
And his name was...

382
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,093
E.T., the extraterrestrial.

383
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,261

I loved that little guy.

385
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720

386
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,443
Leonard Nimoy,
what are you doing here?

387
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,900
Wherever there is mystery
and the unexplained,

388
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,280
-cosmic forces shall draw me near.
-Uh-huh.

389
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,939
Hey, Spock, what do you
want on your hot dog?

390
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,397
Surprise me.

391
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,663

392
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,031

397
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,044
{\an8}These shirts are a

399
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,626

I bring you love.

406
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,361
Is that the love
between a man and a woman,

407
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:21,697
or the love of a man
for a fine cuban cigar?

408
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:25,745
Uh... I bring you love.

409
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,671
It's bringing love!
Don't let it get away!

Wait!

413
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,926
You want an alien?

414
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,760
This is your alien.

415
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,305
Hello, children.

Kill it! Kill it!

418
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,859
It's not a monster.
It's Mr. Burns.

419
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,318
Aw, it's Mr. Burns.

420
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,359

No. No, let me explain.

Mr. Burns undergoes
