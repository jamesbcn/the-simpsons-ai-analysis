We were fighting over
which one of us loves you more.

You were?
Aw, well, go ahead.

I don't want to embarrass

You know how the boss loves

Homer, Mr. Burns just said
he liked it... once.

That's the only time he's
ever spoken to me

without using the word
"bonehead."

I want you to show your father
some love and/or respect.

00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,661
- Tough choice.
- I'm thinking respect.

28
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,206
Good to see you.
Glad you could make it.

29
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,041
Thank you, Mr. Burns,
I'm so glad you invited us.

30
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,997
Not me. I had to miss
little league for this.

Quiet, Tom.

Please, please don't fight.

33
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:56,471
Just go out back
and have a good time.

34
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,471
Fire that man, Smithers.

35
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,953
I don't want him
or his unpleasant family

36
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,011
to ruin my picnic.

37
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,017
He'll be gone
by the tug-of-war, sir.

38
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,849
- Excellent.
- Afternoon, Mr. Burns.

39
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,395
Hi. Hello, there,

40
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,269
- Simpson, Homer.
- Here you go, sir.

41
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,897
Yes.

42
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,404
And this must be
your lovely wife, Marge.

43
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:19,027
And look at little, Lisa.

44
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,025
Why, she's growing like a weed.

45
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,197
- And this must be, Brat.
- Bart.

46
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,957
Don't correct the man, Brat.

47
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,379
Boss, look what we brought,
gelatin desserts.

48
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,299
For the love of Peter.
That's all anybody brought.

49
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,298
Some damn fool went around
telling everyone

50
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,670
I love that slimy goop.

51
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,547
Well, toss it in the pile
over there.

52
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,965
And... make yourselves
at home.

53
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,603
Hear that, Dad?

54
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,819
You can lie around in your
underwear and scratch yourself.

55
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,098
- Now, you listen to me!
- Whoa!

56
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:48,023
- Trouble, Simpson?
- No.

57
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:51,652
Just congratulating the son on
a fine joke about his old man.

58
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,702
Now remember,
as far as anyone knows,

59
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,700
we're a nice, normal family.

60
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,872
Hey, Bart, last one in
the fountain's a rotten egg!

61
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,951
Hey!

62
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,955
D'Be normal!
Be normal!

63
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,458
What an adorable little girl.

64
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,711
Thank you.

65
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,344
Why don't we dump them
in the nursery

66
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,590
and get a glass of punch?

67
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,302
I'm not much of a drinker.

68
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,262
Hey, isn't that your boy there
torturing the swans?

69
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,553
Bart!

70
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,603
Maybe I will take you up
on that punch.

71
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:31,186
Gee, do you think
we should leave the kids unsupervised?

72
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,191
You're right.
There.

73
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,780
Bart! Lisa!

74
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,493
- Where are you kids?
- Whoops.

75
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,724
- Got ya!
- Whoa, careful, Dad.

76
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,412
Blow a gasket,
you lose your job.

77
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,874
Now hear this:
The father/son sack race

78
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,955
will begin in five minutes
on the north lawn.

79
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,791
Participation is mandatory.

80
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,376
Repeat, mandatory.
That is all.

81
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,132
You remember the rules
from last year?

82
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,764
Yeah. Shut my mouth,
and let your boss win.

83
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,762
Hey!

84
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,054
I don't know who to love more:

85
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,638
my son, Joshua, who's captain
of the football team;

86
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,524
or my daughter, Amber, who got
the lead in the school play.

87
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:13,351
Usually, I use their grades
as a tiebreaker,

88
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,398
but they both got
straight A's this term, so...

89
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,481
what's a mother to do?

90
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,147
Well, I sense greatness
in my family.

91
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,695
Your family?

92
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,778
Well, it's a greatness
that others can't see,

93
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,115
but it's there.

94
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,079
And if it's not
true greatness we have,

95
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,581
we're at least average.

96
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,787
I don't want to alarm anyone,

97
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:37,054
but I think there's
a little al-key-hol in this punch.

98
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,677
- Mr. Burns, are you ready?
- Yes.

99
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,929
- Are you set?
- Yes.

100
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,351
Go, Mr. Burns.

101
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:58,187
Man, this is pathetic.
I'm goin' for it!

102
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,904
Bart, no!

103
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,363
No, wait.
No. Bart, don't.

104
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,197
Don't. No!

00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:27,983
like a normal family.

175
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,817
- Happy, Dad?
- Yes.

176
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,703
Good.
Commence shoveling.

177
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,240
No. We're going
to say grace first.

178
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,235
Okay. Rub-a-dub-dub,
thanks for the grub.

179
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,368
No!
Ignore the boy, Lord.

180
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,327
Now, can the chatter,
and bow your heads.

181
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,804
Dear Lord, thank you
for this microwave bounty,

182
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,801
even though we don't deserve it.

183
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,603
I mean, our kids are
uncontrollable hellions.

184
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,258
Pardon my French,
but they act like savages.

185
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,517
Did you see them at the picnic?

186
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,440
Of course you did.
You're everywhere.

187
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:03,808
You're "omnivorous."

188
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,524
O Lord, why did you
smite me with this family?

189
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,266
- Amen!
- Let's eat.

190
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,152
No, I'm not done yet!

191
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,235
But Homer, how long are we
supposed to sit here

192
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,661
and listen to you bad-mouth
us to the man upstairs?

193
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,280
I'm sorry, Marge,

194
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,906
but sometimes I think we're
the worst family in town.

195
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,874
Maybe we should move
to a larger community.

196
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,424
Don't have a cow, Dad.

197
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,708
The sad truth is,
all families are like us.

198
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,422
You think so?

199
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,422
Well, there's only one way
to find out. Follow me.

200
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:40,102
Look at that, kids.
No fighting. No yelling.

201
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,601
No belching.
The dad has his shirt on.

202
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,893
Look, napkins!

203
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,596
These people
are obviously freaks.

204
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,356
You think so?

205
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,268
Well, let's see
what's behind door number two.

206
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,648
What are they doing?

207
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,444
They're having a conversation.

208
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,197
They actually enjoy
talking to each other.

209
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,800
I wish I could hear
what they're saying.

210
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,793
Papa, I believe I heard
some rustling in the bushes.

211
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:04,038
I did too.
Better get the gun.

212
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,171
Where's he going?

213
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,538
Probably to get the old man
his pipe and slippers.

214
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,266
Whoa, look at this place.
What a dump!

215
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,890
It's worse than you think.

216
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,557
I just trampled
this poor sap's flower bed.

217
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,227
Homer, this is our house.

218
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,486
- Are you coming in, Homer?
- No, no.

219
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,988
I wanna be alone
with my thought.

220
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,473
Fans are getting just
a little bit anxious here.

221
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,991
Another beer, Moe.

222
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:45,286
What's a matter, Homer?
Bloodiest fight of the year.

223
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,541
You're sitting there like
a thirsty bump on a log.

224
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,923
- Eddie.
- Evening, Moe.

225
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,500
- Want some pretzels?
- No, thanks. We're on duty.

226
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,456
A couple beers
would be nice, though.

227
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,627
That'll be two bucks, boys.

228
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,763
Just kidding.

229
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,471
Good one, Moe.

230
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,591
Listen, we're looking for
a family of Peeping Toms

231
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,928
who's been terrorizing
the neighborhood.

232
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,973
Quiet, boy. Let the nice people
enjoy their beers.

233
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,188
Don't worry.
This dog has the scent.

234
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,651
Hey. What's gotten into Bobo?

235
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,321
I got some wieners in my pocket.

236
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,530
That figures.
Come on, you stupid dog.

237
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,911
You know, Moe,

238
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,030
my mom once said something
that really stuck with me.

239
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:28,408
She said, "Homer,
you're a big disappointment."

240
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:33,207
And God bless her soul,
she was really on to something.

241
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,264
Don't blame yourself, Homer.
You got dealt a bad hand.

242
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,468
You got crummy little kids
that nobody can control.

243
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,049
You can't talk that way
about my kids!

244
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,764
Or at least two of them.

245
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,974
- Why, you got two I haven't met?
- Why you...

246
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,644
Here's five you haven't met.

247
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,233
A tremendous right.
That's just gotta hurt.

248
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,909
Ladies and gentlemen,
this fight is over!

249
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,153
"All-Star Boxing"
is brought to you by...

250
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:58,072
Dr. Marvin Monroe's
Family Therapy Center.

251
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,242
What?

252
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,621
Honey, aren't you
going to work today?

253
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,778
I don't think so.

254
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,486
Honey, you have a problem,

255
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,366
and it won't get better
till you admit it.

256
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,873
I admit this: You better
shut your big yap.

257
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,455
- You shut up.
- No, you shut up!

258
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,581
No, you shut up!

259
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,997
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

260
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,205
Why don't you both shut up?

261
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,376
Hi, friends.
I'm Dr. Marvin Monroe.

262
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,086
Does this scene look familiar?

263
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,506
If so, I can help.

264
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,604
No gimmicks. No pills.
No fad diets.

265
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,310
Just family bliss,

266
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,980
or double your money back.

267
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,599
So call today.

268
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:35,435
Dr. Marvin Monroe's
Family Therapy Center.

269
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,573
Why don't you call right now?

270
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,780
When will I learn?

271
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,490
The answer to life's problems

272
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,910
aren't at the bottom
of a bottle.

273
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,528
They're on TV!

274
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,469
All right,
time for a family meeting.

275
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,892
Why can't we have a meeting
when you're watching TV?

276
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,311
Now look, you know and I know

277
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,980
this family needs help,
professional help.

278
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,399
So I've made us an appointment
with Dr. Marvin Monroe.

279
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,148
The fat guy on TV?

280
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,820
You're sending us to doctor who
advertises on pro wrestling?

281
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,320
Boxing, Lisa, boxing.
There's a world of difference.

282
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,823
Gee, Homer, are you sure
this is the right thing to do?

283
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,405
Honey, I've given
this matter a lot of study,

284
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,331
and of all the commercials
I saw, his was the best.

285
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,251
All it costs is $250.

286
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,790
We don't have
that kind of money.

287
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,384
Well, then, we're just
going to have to dig deep.

288
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,039
Marge, go get
the kids' college fund.

289
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,298
Hey!

290
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,129
- Homer.
- Come on, Marge.

291
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,215
Why scrimp now on the off-chance

292
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,861
that they'll actually
get in some place?

293
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,927
Forty-eight.
Forty-nine. Fifty.

294
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,854
Eighty-eight dollars
and fifty cents.

295
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:52,982
That's it?

296
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,348
That's the college fund

297
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,345
we've been saving for
all these years?

298
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,857
I guess I'd have needed
a partial scholarship.

299
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,019
Well, we're not licked yet.

300
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,525
To save this family,

301
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,859
we're going to have to make
the supreme sacrifice.

302
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:07,494
No, Dad.
Please, don't pawn the TV.

303
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,163
Come on, Dad, anything but that.

304
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,162
Homer, couldn't we pawn
my engagement ring instead?

305
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:17,825
Now, I appreciate that, honey,
but we need $150 here!

306
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,207
Afternoon, Simpson.
So what can I do for ya?

307
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:25,465
Would you pay $150
for this lovely Motorola?

308
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,969
Is it cable ready?

309
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,141
Ready as she'll ever be.

310
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,719
Mister, you got yourself a deal.

311
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,020
♪♪

312
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,312
All our money,
the college funds, the TV.

313
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,977
Homer, you're driving a stake

314
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,816
through the hearts
of those who love you.

315
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,571
Hey, no pain, no gain.

316
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,363
Will you be paying
by cash or check?

317
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:51,866
Cash, of course. I've got
$250 right here with me.

318
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:56,041
I'm holding it right now.
Here it is. Look.

319
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,671
Check it out, 250 big ones.

320
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,209
If you really want to
impress her,

321
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,802
show her the big, empty space
where our TV used to be.

322
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,298
- Bart!
- Come on, family.

323
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,300
Let's go celebrate
our newfound ability

324
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,222
to express love for each other.

325
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,510
I'm taking you out for
frosty chocolate milkshakes.

326
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,304
Yay!

327
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:18,095
There go my young-girl
dreams of Vassar.

328
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,805
Hello,
I'm Dr. Marvin Monroe.

329
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,105
No doubt you recognize me
from TV.

330
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,069
- We would if we had one.
- Lisa!

331
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,489
No, no, Homer,
don't stifle the youngster.

332
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,358
Your family must feel free
to express itself.

333
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,736
That's what these pads
and jumbo markers are for.

334
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,374
I want you to draw for me
your fears, your anxieties,

335
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,082
the roots of your unhappiness.

336
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,083
Now, take a deep,
cleansing breath.

337
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,421
And begin.

338
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,391
No surprises here.

339
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,600
Homer?

340
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,352
Homer, what have you got for us?

341
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,482
- Homer?
- Oops, sorry.

342
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,404
I wasn't paying attention.

343
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,612
Well, if you had been
paying attention,

344
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,843
perhaps you would have noticed
that your family sees you

345
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,822
as a rather stern
authority figure,

346
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,735
an ogre, if you will.

347
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,445
Now, Doctor, that's not true.

348
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,035
Ogre is such a strong word.

349
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,040
Right on, Doc!
Another successful diagnosis.

350
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,883
- That does it!
- Wow!

351
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,338
Okay, you wanna kill each other.

352
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,799
That's good.
That's healthy.

353
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,300
There's nothing necessarily
wrong with hostile conflict.

354
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,683
All I ask is that you use

355
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,161
my patented aggression
therapy mallets.

356
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,009
- Good idea.
- All right.

357
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,517
I don't know.

358
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,729
Okay. Let's take another
deep, cleansing breath.

359
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,413
Wait a minute.

360
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,340
These mallet things are
padded with foam rubber.

361
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,406
What's the point?

362
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,584
They'd work much better
without the padding, Doc.

363
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,792
No, no. That's not true.

364
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,633
- Give me that.
- See?

365
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:08,628
Yes, well, that concludes
this portion of our treatment.

366
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,592
- Are we cured yet?
- Don't be ridiculous.

367
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,643
You will be cured,
but it's going to require

368
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,598
somewhat more
unorthodox methods.

369
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,718
- Unortho what?
- Don't worry.

370
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,926
I'll have plenty of time
to explain while I warm up the...

371
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,977
electric generator.

372
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,861
Everyone comfy?
Good.

373
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,019
Now, don't touch any of
those buttons in front of you

374
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,778
for a very important reason,

375
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,359
i.e., you are wired into
the rest of your family.

376
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,736
You have the ability
to shock them,

377
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,264
and they have
the ability to shock...

378
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,536
Just testing.

379
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,699
- Why you... Aw.
- No, Homer, not yet.

380
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,828
You see, this is what is known
as aversion therapy.

381
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,376
When someone
hurts you emotionally,

382
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,339
you will hurt them physically.

383
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:53,379
And gradually you will learn
not to hurt each other at all.

384
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,835
And won't that be
wonderful, Homer?

385
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,336
Yes, Doctor.

386
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,257
Whoa!

387
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,619
Bart, how could you shock
your little sister?

388
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,811
My finger slipped.

389
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,233
So did mine.

390
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,233
Bart, Lisa, stop that.

391
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,237
No, no. Now, wait a minute.

392
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,741
Wait! Wait!
Folks, if I could...

393
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,445
This is not the way
to get healthy!

394
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,627
No! You've got
to understand something!

395
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,297
♪♪ -People, please!

396
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,546
Boy. Someone's really
gobbling up the juice, sir.

397
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,556
Excellent. Excellent.

398
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:45,808
Perhaps this energy conservation
fad is as dead as the dodo.

399
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,693
No, no!

400
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,652
Dr. Monroe, your other patients
have fled the building.

401
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,775
Stop! Stop!

402
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,491
You're damaging the equipment.

403
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,623
Hey. Nice hair, Mom.

404
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,124
Gee, I thought we were
making real progress.

405
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,877
No, I'm sorry, you're not!

406
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,248
Please, you've just got to go.

407
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,706
Wait a minute, Doc.
Your TV commercial said,

408
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,627
"Family bliss
or double our money back."

409
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,427
But that was just...

410
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,811
All right.
Get the money.

411
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,230

20, 40, 60, 80, 300.

413

20, 40, 60, 80, 400.
20, 40, 60, 80, 500.

414
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,151
Just go, and never tell
anyone you were here!

415
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,244
Wow, 500 smackers.

416
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,370
Homer, how wonderful,
our first pleasant surprise.

417
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,699
It's not the money, as much as
the feeling that we earned it.

418
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,196
You did it, Dad.

419
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,667
Excuse me, dear.
Shouldn't we be heading

420
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,128
down to the pawn shop
to get our TV back?

421
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,879
That piece of junk?
Forget it.

422
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,922
We're gonna get a new TV.

423
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,795
Twenty-one inch screen,
realistic flesh tones

424
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,303
and a little cart

425
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,845
so we can wheel it into
the dining room on holidays.

426
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,349
Yay!

427
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,720
Homer, we love you.
