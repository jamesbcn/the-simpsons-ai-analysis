00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:18,885
{\an8}It is the golden age of well-written,

39

{\an8}you might sell them for possibly $500.

{\an8}Oh, that's insane.

96
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,794
{\an8}My dad was married to a woman

97
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,964
{\an8}who left him because he ignored
her needs for decades.

98
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,375
Ah, my gay dad is gay for gays.

Those are pretty cute.

105
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,188
Your dad's been in the closet
for so long,

106
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,606
he probably doesn't know how
tolerant society's become.

107
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:44,026
They even had a gay float
in the Pride Parade last year.

108
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,037
My dad has always been so angry.

109
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,250
Maybe if we help him be who he is,

110
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,080
he'll finally be happy.

111
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,455
Oh, Homie,

112
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,462
you're so enlightened.

113
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,965
Yeah, gay rights are human rights, baby.

114
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,386
(humming)

115
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,351
{\an8}Are you sure you're not
just doing all this

116
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,602
{\an8}because it's cool to be accepting
of a gay family member?

117
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,975
{\an8}Oh, honey, that's just silly.

118
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,862
{\an8}This'll show Helen Lovejoy.

119
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,819
{\an8}Always bragging about
her transgender cousin.

120
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,990
Abe, we found your storage locker.

121
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,821
And it's okay, Dad.

122
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,826
We know the truth,
and we love you.

123
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,038
What?!

124
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,828
The contents of that locker
are my private business!

125
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,002
Get out!

126
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,670
Just admit who you are,

127
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,579
and you can find new love.

128
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,457
If you don't want to die alone,

129
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,804
come out of your room.

130
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,050

Love... love...

131
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,723
love... love...

132
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,471
(all gasping)

133
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,217
Hi, Marge.

134
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,056
I was just taking Stanlerina
to get her hormone shots.

135
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,392
Oh.

136
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,017
Your father wasted
his whole life being married

137
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,564
to your mother and having you.

138
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,647
We've got to find him a boyfriend
before it's too late.

139
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,074
Why don't you put
a personal ad on the Internet?

140
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,203
That's how young people
date these days.

141
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,820
It's weird that you don't
consider yourself a young person.

142
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,988
I know. It's weird to me, too.

143
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,197
"Help me out of the closet.

144
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,867
Wonderful older man seeks life partner

145
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,166
before rapidly-encroaching death."

146
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,250
No fatties.

147
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,995
-How about some fatties?
-Fine.

148
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,168
Okay, post this under "Men Seeking Men."

149
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,877
But what subheading?

150
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,297
Hmm, nothing too serious.

151
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,306
Here we go, "Casual Encounters."

152
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,349
Perfect! No pressure.

153
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,306
I hope someone saw our ad.

154
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,145
If I can't find my father a man
to kiss and cuddle,

155
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,731
then I've failed as a son.

156
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,976
(gasps)
Someone's coming.

157
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:46,067
Are you "Wrinkled and Romantic"?

158
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,405
Huh? What the heck are you
talking about, Spectacles?

159
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,831
Oh, I've been hung up
on someone for years,

160
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,040
but I'm trapped in the friend zone.

161
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,831
(sighs)
It's time for me to move on.

162
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,084
So move on. You're blocking the ducks.

163
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,336
Don't you want to be happy, Abe?

164
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,089
Admit who you are, a wonderful gay man.

165
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,012
(stammers) What?!

166
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,842
I don't ride sidesaddle!

167
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,427
I'm straight as a submarine!

168
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,932
Then how do you explain this?

169
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,814
Oh, hello, Smithers.
(chuckles)

170
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,691
Fancy seeing you
in Casual Encounter Park.

171
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,358
-(gasps) You're Glamorous Godfrey!
-Who?

172
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,031
Glamorous Godfrey was the most
famous wrestler in the world.

173
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,401
And you are he!

174
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,107
Is this true?

175
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,567
BURNS: Behold.

176
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,697
HOMER:
Look at all this wrestling crap.

177
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,624
-Ah.
-<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

178
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,372
Fine, I was Glamorous Godfrey.

179
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,785
(sobbing)

180
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:38,884
What's wrong?

181
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,538
I so wanted him to be gay.

182
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,667
Well, on V.E. Day,
I kissed a man by mistake.

183
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,215
Thank you.

184
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,676
You were a world-famous wrestler?

185
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,393
Spill the beans, old man.

186
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,604
Word beans!

187
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,733
Oh, all right, I'll tell you.

188
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,940
It was the 1950s.

189
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,811
HOMER (groans):
Oh, those things?

190
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,398
<i>GRAMPA: It was the heyday</i>
<i>of pro wrestling.</i>

191
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,114
<i>You could make good money</i>

192
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,364
<i>if you were the manly mixture</i>
<i>of strong and fat</i>

193
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,066
<i>we called beefy.</i>

194
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,526
<i>Good guys were called "baby faces."</i>

195
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,198
<i>And bad guys were called "heels."</i>

196
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:20,077
<i>I was the king of the heels,</i>
<i>Glamorous Godfrey.</i>

197
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,496
How dare he!

198
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,294
That was drinking milk!

199
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,797
<i>GRAMPA:</i>
<i>My motto was "Always cheat."</i>

200
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,710
(groans)

201
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,047
(groans)

202
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:35,885
<i>But the thing that really drove</i>
<i>them crazy was my vanity.</i>

203
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,773
You are the luckiest people in the world.

204
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,981
You get to look at me.

205
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,482
(crowd booing)

206
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,781
Grampa, you were the original bad boy.

207
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,451
Yeah, I was boastful before
all your football showboaters,

208
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,242
rap music-ers and TV beach Italians.

209
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,286
But there was a downside to being hated:

210
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,911
being hated.

211
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,997
(crowd booing)

212
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,588
(crowd booing)

213
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,715
<i>Well, I just couldn't take it.</i>

214
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,848
Being despised was no way to live.

215
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,226
Pshaw! Pshaw, I say!

216
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,613
Pshaw yourself!

217
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,400
-Pshaw!
-Pshaw!

218
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,903
Homer, do something!

219
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,525
They're killing each other!

220
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,491
Oh, yeah? (muffled shouting)

221
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,282
The world may have despised
Glamorous Godfrey,

222
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,946
but that conceited
mother-puncher was my hero.

223
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,367
Please, Abe, let me buy you dinner

224
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,615
in exchange for a few tales
of the golden age

225
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,958
of professional grappling.

226
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:49,802
Sorry, I've been trying to forget
those days for 50 years.

227
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,050
But, Grampa,

228
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,012
I want to hear about
old-time wrestling, too.

229
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,432
Well, it looks like you've made a new fan.

230
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,261
It'd be a shame to let him down, hmm?

231
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,677
Fine. One dinner.

232
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,976
Excellent.

233
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,189
So we'll take the boy
and make a night of it.

234
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,400
I don't know.

235
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,809
Should I really let the men

236
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,607
who ruined my past and present

237
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,361
hang out with the kid who's
going to ruin my future?

238
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,614
I'll bring you home my dessert.

239
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,065
Text me the choices.

240
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:18,622
I can't believe I'm on the town
with Glamorous Godfrey himself.

241
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:22,041
Tell me of your epic battle
with Swedish Olaf Johannsen.

242
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,631
Oh, yeah, "The Fury of the Fjords."

243
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,998
(Swedish accent) He can't get a
beauty treatment during a match.

244
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,586
(muffled grunting)

245
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,422
(laughs)

246
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,427
You settled that Swede's meatballs.

247
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,759
What I wouldn't give
to see Glamorous Godfrey

248
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,675
in action once more.

249
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,854
Would you ever consider
throwing your wig back into the ring?

250
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,693
Go back to being a villain?

251
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,309
Oh, forget that.

252
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,105
Being hated is the worst feeling there is.

253
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,110
(chuckles) You've got it all wrong,
my friend.

254
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,703
Once you see it my way,
you'll understand that being hated

255
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,200
is the greatest feeling in the world.

Okay, Burns!

293
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:29,116
Glamorous Godfrey will wrestle again!

294
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,366
(all gasp)

295
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,128

(indistinct chatter)

297
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,182
I can't wait to see Grampa
kick some ass.

298
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,852
He's always pretended to be boring,

299
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,470
but he's really a straight-up psycho.

300
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,307
Your grandfather is not psycho.

301
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,483
The only thing he "straight-up"
is loves you.

302
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,483
Gorilla Joe, Gorilla Sam, Gorilla Pete,

303
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,396
Ook and Eek, the Gorilla Twins.

304
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,235
Where did Mr. Burns dig up
all these old wrestlers?

305
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,991
Apparently, old folks homes
are full of people that used to be things.

306
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,584
Just like you and me.
Swear to God.

307
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,080
Welcome,
aficionados of the roped ring,

308
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,753
to a thrilling night
of senior-on-senior action.

309
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,172
-(grunting)
-(snoring)

310
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,801
(grunting grows weaker)

311
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,588
(both snoring)

312
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,472
(all snoring)

313
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,799
(crowd cheering)

314
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,394
Folding chairs! Folding chairs!

315
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,220
Can't hit somebody when they're not
looking without a folding chair!

316
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,346
-Can I have one? Can I?
-Fine.

317
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,563
Ha!

318
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,563
And now our main event.

319
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,515
In this corner, Baby Face Palooka.

320
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,936
And entering the ring,

321
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,444
America's original vainglorious bastard,

322
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,277
Glamorous Godfrey!

323
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,782
(crowd booing)

324
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,703
(baroque orchestral music playing)

325
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,947
(booing continues)

326
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,497
Yes, feel the hatred.

327
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,921
It makes you strong, powerful, alive.

328
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,381
You are the luckiest people in the world!

329
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,723
You get to look at me!

330
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,929
(booing continues)

331
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,549
(crowd coughing)

332
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,216
(crowd booing)

333
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,604
You show 'em, Godfrey!

334
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,521
You're the prettiest
old man in the world!

335
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,349
Why do you think
bad guys are so cool?

336
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,305
Why do you still have
a thing for Nelson?

337
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,436
I do not! That's ridiculous!

338
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,483
I just... it's that... he, uh...

339
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,107
He's a rebel,
and only I can change him!

340
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,954
-(clang)
-(crowd clamoring, booing)

341
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,367
(crowd shouting)

342
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,536
(booing)

343
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,926
It's so sad that Grampa has to cheat

344
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,639
instead of relying on his
God-given wrestling skills.

345
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,060
What kind of person
revels in disapproval?

346
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,100
What kind of person, indeed.

347
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,937
(baroque orchestral music playing)

348
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:02,943
MILHOUSE: It's the prettiest boy
in Springfield, Bart Simpson!

349
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,697
-(indistinct chatter)
-What's going on?

350
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,124
You are the luckiest people in the world!

351
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,791
You get to look at me!

352
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,460
(crowd booing)

353
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,207
Hey! (grunts)

354
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,212
(Bart humming)

355
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,304
(coughs)

356
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,878
(booing continues)

357
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,013
Hey, Simpson, tell your kid
to quit showboating.

358
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,840
I've never seen anyone
so full of self-regard!

359
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,598
And I've worked with Bob Balaban!

360
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,020
(booing continues)

361
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,023
Your behavior at that game
was unacceptable!

362
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,776
You're lucky they gave you
your participant trophy!

363
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,319
{\an8}I got one just for watching the game.

364
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,947
Listen, getting people riled up
is what heels do.

365
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,913
Heel? Oh, no.

366
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,703
Tell me you're not
trying to be like Grampa!

367
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,077
Well, sure I am.

368
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,753
I always thought Grampa was lame,

369
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,581
but he's really awesome!

370
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,917
Your grandfather is super lame!

371
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,592
I mean, if he wasn't a terrible father,

372
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,512
what's my excuse for this?

373
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,930
(grunting)

374
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,683
I know your grandpa seems exciting now,

375
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,143
but all that preening and cheating,

376
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,774
those turnbuckle antics,
are not gonna make him happy.

377
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,402
(Grampa and Burns sigh)

378
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,690
Burnsy, I can't remember the last time

379
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,234
I was so happy!

380
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,322
You grandson-ruining fiend!

381
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,614
Look what your number one fan

382
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,068
did at show-and-tell!

383
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,905
<i>ROBOTIC VOICE: Pain. Ow.</i>

384
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,834
<i>Pain!</i>

385
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,752
Who would film such a thing?

386
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,331
It's found footage!

387
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,166
So what? We could use
another winner in this family!

388
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,922
How are you a winner?

389
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,594
You're cheating in a fake sport.

390
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,302
Fake? Ridiculous.

391
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,052
If professional wrestling were fake,

392
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,724
that would make every fan
in the history of the sport

393
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,933
a complete and utter moron.

394
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,930
<i>Mercy.</i>

395
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,147
You know, I've always had
a keen eye for tiny talent.

396
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,728
Perhaps you and the lad
could tag-team up.

397
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,944
Wrestle with Bart?

398
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,944
Well, he ain't beefy,
but he is infuriating,

399
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,817
and you can't teach infuriating.

400
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,783
Monty, you're a genius!

401
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,454
Bart cannot be an old-time wrestler!

402
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,583
As your inattentive son,
and your incompetent employee,

403
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,872
I forbid it!

404
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:24,125
{\an8}Oh, why does everything I forbid
always happen?

405
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,669
{\an8}(grunts)

406
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,132
(indistinct chatter)

407
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,007
So, Beautiful,
you got your moves memorized?

408
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,465
You know it, Glamorous!

409
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,425
Eye gouge! Ear bite! Folding chair!

410
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,385
Hair pull! Face-fart! Flying face-fart!

411
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,386
And then I start fighting dirty.

412
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,848
(laughs)

413
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,937
They're gonna hate you so much.

414
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,319
Oh, I get it.

415
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,900
You're here to tell the kid
he can't wrestle with his grandpa.

416
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,067
(grunting)

417
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,616
I don't care if Bart is a wrestler,

418
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,290
a busboy,

419
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,868
or even
a stoplight squeegee man,

420
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,584
as long as he's a nice person.

421
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,495
But if he gets too much attention
for acting bad,

422
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,505
he might turn bad on the inside.

423
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,378
Eh, that's women-talk.

424
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:15,215
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to comb out my curls!

425
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,512
One... two... three...

426
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,391
(crowd cheering in distance)

427
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:25,015
Beautiful Bart, can I have your autograph?

428
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,694
Sure. Here you go.

429
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,152
(hawks, spits)

430
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,112
(laughs)

431
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,032
Eh, hey, Bart,

432
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,111
leave some of that bad
attitude for the ring.

433
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,486
The world is my ring now.

434
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,833
(laughing manically)

435
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,409
In this corner, for truth and justice,

436
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,248
Captain Flag and Half-Mast.

437
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,253
(crowd cheering)

438
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,875
Now entering the ring,
the first family of foul play,

439
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,094
Glamorous Godfrey and Beautiful Bart!

440
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,554
(crowd booing)

441
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,295
-(sniffing)
-You all stink!

442
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,017
(crowd shouting)

443
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,112
Glamorous Godfrey is dead!

444
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,818
(all gasp)

445
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,978
(crowd murmuring)

446
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,317
I am Honest Abe!

447
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,573
(all gasp)

448
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,163
And this is Laddie Liberty!

449
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,743
What are you doing?

450
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,328
I ain't a heel no more, I'm a good guy.

451
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,714
And you're a baby-face.

452
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,040
But-but what about the cheating?

453
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,125
No more cheating.

454
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,209
And the preening?

455
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,384
No more preening.

456
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,631
But I'm so pretty.

457
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,473
That's for others to say now.

458
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,839
What are you doing, Godfrey?

459
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:40,045
You're a villain,
not some bullet-brained rail-splitter.

460
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,847
Without someone to hate,
there's no excitement, no thrill.

461
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,521
I don't care.
My grandson's soul is at stake.

462
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,401
How dare you!
I wrote a song for you.

463
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,188
When am I ever
going to use that again?

464
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,692
Curse you, and this morbidly obese
little half-wit.

465
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,952
So, they only want to see a good guy

466
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,030
fight a bad guy, eh?

467
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,365
(gasps)

468
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,620
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa...

469
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,292
(crowd gasps)

470
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,080
He's taking on Mean Man Monty!
Go get him, Honest Abe!

471
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,456
This is why we go to
everything in this town--

472
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,793
it always pays off.

473
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,963
(gasps)

474
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,418
Honest Abe, can I pin him?

475
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,297
Ha-ha!
You know it, Laddie Liberty!

476
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,803
(grunting)

477
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,056
(crowd cheering)

478
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,980
Damndest boos I ever heard.

479
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,773
They're cheering, Grampa.

480
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,726
This is what I've been missing
my whole life.

481
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,817
(cheering continues)

482
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,283
Oh, that was so sweet.

483
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,994
(sobbing softly)
I wish Grampa was my dad.

484
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,254
{\an8}(bluesy rock music playing)

485
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,171
Shh!
