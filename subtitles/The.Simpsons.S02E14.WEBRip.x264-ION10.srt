Greasy Joe's
Bottomless Bar-B-Q Pit.

24
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,811
Homer, remember you promised

25
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,138
you'd try to limit pork
to six servings a week.

26
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,894
Marge, I'm only human.

27
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,646
Now look. Here's what
we're gonna do.

28
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,858
We'll unload the kids
on Patty and Selma

29
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,649
Saturday night,
and then we'll eat

30
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,282

out of the place.

31
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,489

00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,363
I'm not even sure my sisters
will be available.

34
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,867
I'll take that bet.

00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,958
Hello, Marge.
This Saturday?

38
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,541
We're going to
Stanley Peterson's wedding.

39
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,207
The way he's going at her,

40
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,455
you'd think
they were already married.

41
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,588
Hey, alley cats!

42
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,175
Save it for the honeymoon.

43
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,430
Well, if you have other plans...

44
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,102
-D'oh!
-It's no problem.

45
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,141
Mm-hmm. We'll beat it before
they throw out the bouquet.

46
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,056
"F," "L..."

47
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,516
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

48
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,435
That's a "C," isn't it?

49
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,114
If that was an oncoming vehicle

50
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,692
you'd be dead now.

51
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,737
-Next!
-But driving is my livelihood.

52
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,492
Take it like a man.

53
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:41,664
{\an8}Friends, relatives...

54
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,914

00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,957
we are gathered here today

56
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,211
to join Stanley and Martha
in holy matrimony.

57
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,835
Martha, my dear,

58
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:55,181
I remember the first day
that I met you.

59
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,008
Hello, Selma.

60
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,425
Hello, Stanley.

61
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,135
-Is this seat taken?
-Yes, it is.

62
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,015
Hey, beat it!

63
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:14,653
Had I not chosen the seat that
was next to you, Martha, my love,

64
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,986
who knows what woman
I might have ended up with.

65
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,161
Hmm.

69
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,501
Poor Brandy.

70
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:37,088
Aunt Selma, do you think
you'll ever get married?

71
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,795
Oh, I don't know.
Why? You know somebody?

72
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,466
No, and since I'm sure
that you'd only resent

73
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,885
the pity of an eight year-old niece,

74
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:47,103
I'll simply hope that you're one of
the statistically insignificant number

75
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,805
of 40-year-old, single women
who ever find their fair prince.

76
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,687
(yawning)

77
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,565

MARGE:
Patty, Selma, we're home.

79
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,292
Yeah.

80
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:08,709
(gasping with relief)

81
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,580
I'll tell you one thing.

82
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,377
Greasy Joe is sorry
he ever saw the likes of me.

83
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,381
Marge, I need
to speak with you alone.

84
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,384
(snoring)

85
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,514
Oh, and that sauce, Barney--

86
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,265
I could have drunk a bowl
of it by itself.

87
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,478
Oh, Barney,
that's just my sister-in-law.

88
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,269
I'll get right to the point.

89
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,903
I'm getting older,
fatter and uglier.

90
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:36,071
Please, Marge,
help me find a man

91
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,610
before it's too late.

92
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,525
Well, I'll try.

93
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,703
(stomach gurgling)

94
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,293
Homer, do you remember
our last family vacation

95
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,660
when you made us go
to the Bowlers Hall of Fame

96
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,997
in St. Louis, Missouri
so you could see that car

97
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,133
shaped like a giant bowling pin?

98
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,210
Remember?
Who could forget?

99
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,336
Then you'll also remember
that you owe me a favor

100
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,755
to be called up whenever
and for whatever reason

101
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,304
I desire.

102
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,757
But that was just
an idle promise.

103
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,808
-Not to me.
-Ohh...

104
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:12,981
I want you to find a husband
for my sister, Selma.

105
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,732
Find a husband?

106
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,654
Wait. Which one's Selma again?

107
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,323
She's the one who likes
<i>Police Academy</i> movies

108
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,452
and Hummel figurines

109
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,739
and walking through the park
on clear autumn days.

110
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,163
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
But I thought she was the one

111
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,872
that didn't like to be,
you know, touched.

112
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,413
It's Patty who chose
the life of celibacy.

113
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,747
Selma simply had celibacy
thrust upon her.

114
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:38,173
-But, Marge--
-Homer, you will find her a man!

115
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,174
-All right.
-And not just any man.

116
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:44,046
-Okay.
-He should be honest and caring

117
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,465
and well-off and handsome...

118
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,434
Hey, why should she have
a better husband than you do?

119
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,885
MRS. KRABAPPEL:
Sodium tetra sulfate is highly caustic

120
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,306
and can remove your skin.

121
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,614
-Say when. (chuckles)
-That will do.

122
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,609
What's this stuff for?

123
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,491
It's chiefly used in
the manufacture of rayons, film,

124
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,858
and as a preservative
in fast foods.

125
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,945
-It's also quite a potent herbicide.
-What's a herbicide?

126
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:10,372
-It kills grass.
-Excellent.

127
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,833
Must find man.

128
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,714
Must find man.

129
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,632
Must find man.

130
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:32,678
Boy, a good man
really is hard to find.

131
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,726
Gentlemen, according
to my sources, you are planning

132
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,234
to simultaneously
drop your pencils

133
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,686
at 2:15 this afternoon.

134
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,696
Do so,
and you will be suspended.

135
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,699
Hey, who squealed?

136
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,371
You can't get anything
past Principal Skinner.

137
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,529
He knows everything.

138
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,657
Vandalism fans,
hold onto your hats.

139
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,409
(boys gasping)

140
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,294
Who does he think
he is, anyway?

141
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,627
He's not going
to get away with that.

142
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,801
Sometimes that kid just
goes too far.

143
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,259
One seafood burrito, Apu.

144
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,341
(gulps)

145
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,352
I am loathe to interrupt
your meditation, sir,

146
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,603
but the time has come
for money to change hands.

147
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,725
Oh, sorry.

148
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,905
Hmm. Say what they will
about our cafeteria,

149
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,877
I still think they're the best
Tater Tots money can buy.

150
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,379
(sniffs)

151
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,461
Mmm...

152
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,495
(sniffing)

153
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,548
Wait a minute.

154
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,131
It smells like...

155
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:51,386
sodium tetra sulfate
bonding with chlorophyll.

156
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,641
(sniffing)

157
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,402
Sweet Lord, it is!

158
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,236
PRINCIPAL SKINNER:
Simpson!

159
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,361
(gulps)

160
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,831
Bart, I'm flabbergasted.

161
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,989
Surely, you knew, as you
were writing your own name

162
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,447
in 40-foot high
letters on the field

163
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,037
that you would be caught.

164
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,422
Maybe it was one of
the other Barts, sir.

165
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,459
-There are no other Barts!
-Uh-oh.

166
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,792
The sheer contempt
demonstrated by this incident

167
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,048
makes me wish I could pull

168
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,550
the trusty Board of Education
out of retirement.

169
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,973
(sighs)
Call your father immediately.

170
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,261
(dialing)

171
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,635
-Hello, is Homer there?
-MOE: <i>Homer, who?</i>

172
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,852
Homer... sexual.

173
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,773
Wait one second.
Let me check.

174
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,772
Uh... Homer Sexual?

175
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,315
Come on, come on.

176
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,568
One of you guys has got
to be Homer Sexual.

177
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,401
-(all laughing)
-Don't look at me.

178
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,277
Oh, no!
You rotten little punk.

179
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,405
If I ever get a hold of you,

180
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,412
<i>I'll sink my teeth into your cheek</i>
<i>and rip your face off!</i>

181
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:01,075
-You'll do what, young man?
-What, what, wait. Who is this?

182
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,745
I think the real question is who is this
and where is Homer Simpson?

183
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,594
Whoa, whoa, sorry,
Principal Skinner, sorry.

184
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,131
It's a bad connection,
I think.

185
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,045
It's for you.
I think Bart's in trouble again.

186
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,553
D'oh! What's he done now?

187
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,806
Well, I'm afraid this time the victims
are the innocent blades of grass

188
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,889
on Grounds Keeper Willy's
award-winning play field.

189
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,936
If it's alright with you. I'd like to
have Bart repay his debt to society

190
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,111
through back-breaking
physical labor--

191
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,440
resodding the field manually,

192
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,486
seed by seed.

193
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,714
Hmm. But enough about Bart.

194
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,054
Tell me, Principal Skinner,
are you married?

195
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,800
Only to my job.

196
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,171
But if you weren't married
to your job,

197
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,718
you tend to go for a girl,
right?

198
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,641
(chuckles)
Well, of course.

199
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,561
These pads come off at night
just like everybody else's.

200
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,730
But tell me,
why all the questions?

201
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,809
No reason.

202
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,194
I was just wondering

203
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:11,992
if you'd like to come
over to my house for dinner.

204
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,029
A payback for all
the crummy things

205
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,743
Bart has done
to your school.

206
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:20,083
Well, a home-cooked meal
would be a nice change of pace.

207
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,751
-I'd be delighted.
-Excellent.

208
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,417
(doorbell rings )

209
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,514
Good evening,
Principal Skinner,

210
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,220
-and welcome to our home.
-Thank you, Bart.

211
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,551
I only hope that
for the next few hours

212
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,177
you and I can leave our
differences in the school yard.

213
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,274
Fine. Just get inside already.

214
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,270
He's here.

215
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,192
What are you waiting for?

216
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,650
Get out there and shake
your moneymaker.

217
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,111
-I'm too nervous. You do it.
-No, you do it.

218
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,402
-No, you do it.
-No, you do it.

219
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,775
No, you do it.

220
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,491
SKINNER:
You know, Simpson, I-- I had

221
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,621
a discomforting thought
on the way over here.

222
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,658
This dinner wouldn't be
a master plan of yours

223
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,623
to set me up with some
unmarried relation, would it?

224
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,464
Because I can assure you
that I...

225
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,499
I... Uh...

226
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,504
Oh, be still, my foolish heart.

227
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,337
(chuckles)
Here we go.

228
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,592
Boy meets beast.
(chuckles)

229
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,466
Ahem. Principal Skinner,

230
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,302
allow me to introduce you

231
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,218
to my wife's lovely

232
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,886
and available sister,
Selma.

233
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,064
Hey, tubs, I'm Patty.

234
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,482
-What?
-Patty.

235
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,311
D'oh! Wrong one.

236
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,607
So, Patty, tell me...

237
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,942
tell me more
about your trip to Egypt.

238
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,487
Nothing more to tell, really.
The Nile smells like cattle rot,

239
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,492
and they've got horseflies over there
the size of your head.

240
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,784
Marvelous.

241
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,157
Just marvelous.

242
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,874
Well, Selma hated Egypt too.

243
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,084
A camel spit on her.

244
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,964
Oh yes, I've heard they
can be difficult.

245
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,291
Patty, the Parents
Advisory Board has asked

246
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,127
that I attend the premiere

247
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,672
of <i>Space Mutants, Part V</i>
tomorrow night.

248
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:59,636
-Would you be interested in joining me?
-(silverware drops)

249
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,139
-I don't really...
-She'd be delighted.

250
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,971
-I'm going to cancel.
-No, you're not.

251
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,806
We already have plans
for tomorrow night.

252
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,641
Patty, your first date
in 25 years

253
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,647
is a little more important
than playing hearts with mother.

254
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,150
I tried to repel him,
I really did.

255
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,192
Pack of Lady Laramie 100's,
please.

256
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,357
We both know it could have
easily been me. Very easily.

257
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,987
Laramie Hi-Tars hard pack,
and I don't have all day.

258
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,664
Here you go.
Smoke them in good health.

259
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,164
And will you be needing
any lottery tickets with that?

260
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,496
No. All right, five.

261
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,882
Stupid Principal Skinner.

262
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,169
You've got to be kidding me.

263
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,213
Save your strength, lad.

264
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,007
{\an8}There's a whole field
for you to resod yet. (chuckles)

265
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,221
-D'oh!
-Bart, you wouldn't happen to know

266
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,803
what sort of candy

267
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,098
your Aunt Patty likes,
would you?

268
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,852
-Cherry cordials, sir.
-Very good.

269
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,814
Now then,
regarding your punishment...

270
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,106
Do you feel that you've
learned your lesson?

271
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,241
Have I ever. Just the thought
of doing anything bad again

272
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,779
makes my stomach turn.

273
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,952
Well, then you're free to go.

274
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,662
Well, Willy, you can take it
from here.

275
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,992
-Adios, dude.
-You'll be back!

276
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,287
You haven't seen
the last of Willy.

277
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,212
I don't see why
all this is necessary.

278
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,585
Come on, Patty, you don't want
to show up for your big date

279
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,723
looking like Yosemite Sam.

280
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,931
How do I look?

281
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,555
Achingly beautiful.

282
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,231
<i>♪ Two and two are four ♪</i>

283
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,520
(buzzing)

284
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,233
<i>♪ Four and four are eight ♪</i>

285
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,984
<i>♪ Eight and eight are 16 ♪</i>

286
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,947
-Hello.
-Cherry cordials.

287
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,818
I hope you like them.
(chuckles)

288
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,275
Yeah, I like them okay.

289
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,235
So, come on,
let's get this over with.

290
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,445
Oh! Excellent suggestion.
I suggest we start

291
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,696
with the Springfield
revolving restaurant.

292
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:55,328
You know, food tastes better
when you're revolving.

293
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,457
SELMA:
Yeah, right.

294
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,335
Well, I must say, so far, the evening
is a big disappointment.

295
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,381
Indeed. Truly terrible.

296
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,426
Hey, can we get some service
over here?

297
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,761
I've asked for water
three times now.

298
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,767
-Is everything all right?
-Well, well, well.

299
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,559
If it isn't
little Jimmy Pierson.

300
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,352
Class of '71, I believe.

301
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,055
Good evening,
Principal Skinner.

302
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,515
Pierson, get this woman
a glass of water immediately.

303
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,646
-And tuck in your shirt!
-Yes, sir.

304
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,863
(scoffs)
Nearly 30

305
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,704
and still working
as a bus boy.

306
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,489
I'll tell you

307
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,873
the standardized testing
never lies.

308
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,779
(chuckles)

309
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,448
Doesn't surprise me.

310
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,326
She's always been
the lucky one.

311
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,793
Two minutes younger.

312
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,593
Skin like a china doll
and bosoms till Tuesday.

313
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,208
Well, don't worry.

314
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,005
There's still plenty
of fish in the sea.

315
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,719
-Right, Homer?
-Oh, yes, plenty of fish.

316
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,261
You just don't have any bait.

317
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,350
(yawns)

318
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,933
ACTOR: <i>What a shame.</i>
<i>Out of gas.</i>

319
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,938
Hmm. Hmm?

320
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,190
(yawns)

321
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,773
Don't be stupid.

322
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,818
Oh, sorry.

323
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,905
Come on, love.
Loosen up.

324
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,450
I just can't forget
what happened

325
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,123
to that poor dingo back there.

326
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,871
Who or what could have done
such a horrible thing?

327
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,294
It was probably
just a wallaby.

328
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,293
Now, come on.

329
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,585
Well, okay.

330
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,588
(screaming)

331
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,636
-Ah!
-Hello, Dolly.

332
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:34,481
Oh, that was the worst movie
I've ever seen.

333
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,188
Not as bad as the service
at the revolving restaurant.

334
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,729
(both chuckle)

335
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,363
Isn't it nice we hate
the same things?

336
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,321
(chuckles)

337
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,572
So, see me again tomorrow?

338
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,655
I'm afraid that's
my microwave cookery class.

339
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,331
Then the day after that.

340
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,999
Oh, gee, tae kwon do.

341
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,369
The day after that, then.

342
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,205
Seymour, you're touching me.

343
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,210
Kiss me, Patty.

344
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,461
I don't have cooties.

345
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,542
Hi-ya!

346
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,550
Thursday I'm going
food shopping.

347
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,224
You can come along
if you like.

348
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,553
Until then.

349
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,271
Tell me every filthy detail,

350
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,140
or is your tongue
too tired?

351
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,767
Selma, it was a lousy meal,
the movie was awful,

352
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,024
and he didn't get anything.
Now, good night.

353
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,853
PATTY: Alright. One kiss,
but I don't want you bragging

354
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,559
to your friends
about how you scored.

355
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,743
(children clamoring)

356
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,320
Oh, I wish I could make
a P.A. announcement

357
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,446
to the whole world.

358
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,373
Attention everyone,
Seymour Skinner is in love.

359
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,504
Oh, wow, Simpson,
that's pretty cool.

360
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,291
Bart, Skinner's
going to kill you.

361
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,004
Skinner? Ha!
He works for me now.

362
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,634
-Simpson?
-Oh-oh.

363
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,301
What is that there?

364
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,547
-Hmm...
-Mmm...

365
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,925
Oh... Patty.

366
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,813
(stammering)

367
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,640
Bart, I hate to pull you away
from your daily exercise, but,

368
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,806
well, I wanted you to be
the first to know.

369
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,726
I'm going to ask for your
Aunt Patty's hand in marriage.

370
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,106
Your funeral, Seymour.

371
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,534
Homer, lighten up. You're making
happy hour bitterly ironic.

372
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:57,874
Aw, Moe. I've got to find a date
for my big, fat, snotty

373
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,751
sister-in-law, Selma.

374
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,708
I'm intrigued.
What does Selma look like?

375
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,370
Like my wife's ugly sister.

376
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,878
Wheel her in, Homer.

377
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,749
I'm not a picky man.
(belching)

378
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,336
SALESMAN: A good rule of thumb
is two years salary, sir. Try this.

379
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,965
SKINNER: I can't afford that,
I'm an educator.

380
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,802
-Seymour.
-SKINNER: I'll take it.

381
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,807
Homer, my sister is not going out
with Barney Gumble.

382
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:24,440
HOMER: Hey, Selma's
no prize pig herself, you know.

383
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,520
Bart, come cheer up
your Aunt Selma.

384
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,437
-Okay.
-What did you learn in school today?

385
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,567
Principal Skinner's gonna
ask Aunt Patty to marry him.

386
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,991
Mm. Thanks, kid.

387
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,195
You made my day.

388
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,035
But nothing, Marge.

389
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,711
She's a heifer,
plain and simple, and--

390
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,920
Oh, there's
the little prom queen now.

391
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,751
Can the sweet talk.
You're right.

392
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,667
It's time to ash can
my girlish hopes and dreams

393
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:56,676
and grab hold of
the next train out of the station.

394
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,649
(gasps)
Is that Selma?

395
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,608
Ring-a-ding-ding.

396
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:12,069
-Oh, shut up.
-Why are you dolled up like a chorus girl?

397
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,531
Well, it takes a ripe piece
of cheese to catch the mouse.

398
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,572
(buzzer)

399
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,236
It's time to give away my love
like so much cheap wine.

400
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,115
Take it to the hoop, Selma.

401
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:25,252
Hi, look what I brought.

402
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,460
Ah, schnapps?

403
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,921
-I'll take that.
-(grumbles)

404
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,673
SKINNER: You seem preoccupied tonight,
my little...pudding cup.

405
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,966
PATTY: My sister's on a date
with a big, fat rummy.

406
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:42,851
Oh! Well, there's something up here
that will pick up your spirits.

407
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,940
(gasps)
"Marry me, Patty"?

408
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,691
Jeezum crow!

409
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,612
Look at the size
of that rock!

410
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,861
It's the second most precious
jewel in this bell tower.

411
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,994
Patty, the question before
you is, will you marry me?

412
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,992
Seymour, I don't know.
I mean, this is so....

413
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,075
Oh, just say whatever's
in your heart.

414
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,581
Okay. You see, it's not that
I don't love you.

415
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,754
You love me!
Kalloo kallay!

416
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,844
-(laughing)
-Yes, yes, but...

417
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,300
-But? But?
-But I'm a twin.

418
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,130
And as such,
I have a special...

419
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,256
-Special tie to your sister. Yes.
-Mm-hmm.

420
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,013
And the only man I could marry
would have to understand...

421
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,675
That you couldn't leave
your sister for any man.

422
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,555
-Oh.
-Yes, so I know you appreciate

423
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,523
why you can never...

424
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,193
-See you again?
-Exactly.

425
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:35,112
It's a kind of a catch-22.

426
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,108
Farewell, my Patty-cake.

427
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,198
Good night, sweet Principal.

428
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,384
(sobbing)

429
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,803
Bart Simp...

430
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:12,349
Oh, Springfield Elementary,
I will have you back again.

431
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:17,727
After all, tomorrow
is another school day!

432
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:22,698
And then when I got out
of the service, they, uh--

433
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:26,031
Well, the next few years
are a blur.

434
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,947
Patty, where's Skinner?

435
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,617
We decided we loved
each other enough

436
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,707
never to see
each other again.

437
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,382
I hope I can find
a man like that.

438
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,421
Patty, are you throwing away
your last chance at happiness

439
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,336
-just for me?
-Yes.

440
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,385
Thanks.

441
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,298
Now let's go get some pancakes.

442
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,267
Listen, Barney...

443
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,848
Nah.

444
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,313
She broke my heart, Moe.

445
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,314
Don't worry, Barney.

446
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,226
Time heals all wounds.

447
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,225
Well, what do you know?
You're right!

448
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,988
And look! A whole pitcher
to myself!

449
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,948
(mumbling)
Skinner.

450
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,251
(slurps)

451
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,040
I told you you'd be back.

452
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,214
