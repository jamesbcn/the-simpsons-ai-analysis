He gave to his community

96
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,355

He never--

(whispering)

98
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,452

show up on the bill.

104
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,251
I'll keep this short.

105
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,585
Gladys lived alone, died alone.

106
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,670
I guess you could say she was
a role model for Selma and me.

107
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,888
She wasn't a rich woman...

108

(grumbling)

109
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,063

00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,564
What are
the magical ingredients?

181
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,694
Mostly corn syrup,
a little rubbing alcohol.

182
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,361
You'll be lucky if it doesn't

183
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,899
make your hair fall out,
actually.

184
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,236
(grunting)

185
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,994
Paper or plastic?

186
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,414
You decide.

187
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,003
So, wearing a belt, are you?

188
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:40,999
Yep.

189
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,670
No suspenders for you.

190
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,748
I guess not.

191
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,714
Orange is really your color.

192
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,304
They make us
wear this.

193
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,629
Shall we continue
this conversation over dinner?

194
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,876
Uh... I'm not allowed
to date customers.

195
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,298
It's store policy.

196
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,466
No, it isn't.

197
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,644
-Ow!
-shut up, Arnold.

198
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,853
No, go for it, man.

199
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,812
"R,"

200
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,562
"Q,"

201
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:04,734
"J,"

202
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,862
question mark.

203
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,110
Smiley face.

204
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,148
SELMA: Next!

205
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,486
Wait a minute.

206
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,871
It says here
you're single.

207
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,908
Did I do wrong?

208
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:23,832
Combed, biscuits, chicken,

209
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,964
yellow, mailman...

210
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,133
You're reading
the wine list, sir.

211
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,171
Very good.

212
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,836
{\an8}I don't know how to
thank you for dinner.

213
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,386

Get out of my car.

219
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,333
This isn't my house.

233
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,362
Selma, your date's
over already?

234
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,109
Yeah.
I was so depressed,

235
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,072
I ate a jar
of expired olives.

236
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,413
(sighs)

237
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,278
I guess I'll never
have a baby.

238
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,405
Aunt Selma,
this may be presumptuous,

239
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,912
but have you ever considered
artificial insemination?

240
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,754
Boy, I don't know.

241
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,501
You've got to be
pretty desperate

242
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,172
to make it with a robot.

243
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,961
(whispering)

244
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,464
I knew that.

245
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,918
How do I know
I'm getting quality?

246
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,627
Don't worry.

247
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,348
Our donors have to pass
a rigorous screening process.

248
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,099
All done.

249
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,810
Thank you.

250
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,310
Always a pleasure.

251
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,102
What a beautiful
little girl.

252
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,185
(belches like Barney)

253
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,360

(belching continues)

255
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,358
MARGE: "101 Frozen Pops."

256
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,815
A Nobel Prize winner.

257
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,365
An NBA all-star.

258
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,200
Ooh, one of the Sweathogs.

259
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,957
I checked.
It's not Horshack.

260
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,828
(groans)

261
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,955
Are you sure you want
to have a baby this way?

262
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,593
Yeah, you've had some
pretty bad experiences

263
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,171
ordering out of catalogs.

264
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,126
Remember that
mail-order husband?

265
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,836
(knock at door)

266
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,679
Ooh, you look just like
your picture.

267
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,386
Sorry, my mind's made up.

268
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,436
I want to have a kid,

269
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,269
and this is the only way
I can do it.

270
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,444
Why do you want
to have a baby so bad?

271
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,983
I got a lot of love to give,

272
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,447
and right now my only outlet

273
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,238
is my ham radio.

274
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,912
{\an8}<i>(man speaking</i>
<i>foreign language)</i>

275
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,871
Are you sure you've
thought this through?

276
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,951
A child can really
change your life.

277
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,657
You'll have to
give up smoking.

278
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,957
-I'll chew.
-No man will want you.

279
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,251
All I got now
is sperm in a cup.

280
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,626
(both groaning)

281
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,877
BART/LISA: Get up! Get up!

282
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,676
Time to go
to Duff Gardens.

283
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,890
Mom! Mom!

284
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,759
We want to go
to Duff Gardens!

285
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,728
Oh, great.
Dad's dead.

286
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,899

287
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,728
Oh, have you been eating
that sandwich again?

288
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,936
Sand... wich.

289
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,776
Geez, we hardly made a dent
in that ten-foot hoagie.

290
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,664
I'll give it
a good home.

291
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,865
You've been eating that thing
for a week.

292
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,124
I think the mayonnaise
is starting to turn.

293
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,786
Two more feet,
and I can fit it in the fridge.

294
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,495
Homer, I found this
behind the radiator.

295
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,456
I really think
you should throw it away.

296
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,377
Suggestion noted.

297
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:07,764
Marge, I'd like to be alone
with the sandwich for a moment.

298
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,467
Are you going
to eat it?

299
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,598
Yes.

300
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,310
Aww!

301
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,645
You look terrible.

302
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,730
I don't care.

303
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,895
I'm going to Duff Gardens.

304
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,566

305
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,744
S-s-so cold.

306
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,735
Your lips
are turning blue.

307
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,947
I think
you better stay home.

308
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,577
No!

309
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,634
Duff Gardens! Hurrah!

310
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,289
(horn blaring)

311
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,797
We really appreciate
you taking the children

312
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,590
on such short notice.

313
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,513
We'll have fun,
won't we, kids?

314
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,472
To get to Duff Gardens,
I'd ride with Satan himself.

315
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,723
That's the spirit.

316
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,014
See you tonight.

317
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,637
Good-bye, Dad.

318
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,734
Don't eat any solids.

319
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,518
But I love solids.

320
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,942
It won't be any fun
without you, Dad.

00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,040
To cheer you up, I rented
a couple of videos.

362
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,710
"Boxing's Greatest Weigh-Ins"
and "Yentl."

363
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,709
"Yentl"? What's that?

364
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,421
It deals with a bookish
young woman's efforts

365
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,211
to enter rabbinical school.

366
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,674
Sounds great!

367
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,674
Oh, my God,
you're delirious.

368
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,677
Hmm...

369
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,933
(Bart reading)

370
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,191
Wow!

371
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,649
You're charming the pants
off of me.

372
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,770
What did you say,
Aunt Selma?

373
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,607
I said take off
those damn glasses!

374
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,452
Ooh, this looks like fun.

375
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,028
A bench.

376
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,573
Kids, what do you say
you go get your Aunt Selma

377
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,077
a beer smoothie?

378
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,079
BOTH: No, come on, Aunt Selma,
we got to go.

379
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,752
Come on,
let's have fun!

380
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,923
(groaning)

381
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,843
Hey, man, if the line's
this long, it's got to be good.

382
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,175
Get bent.

383
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,390
<i>MAN (on TV):</i>
<i>What's going on here?</i>

384
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,141
<i>Oh, Yentl.</i>
<i>I might have known.</i>

385
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,233
That Yentl puts the "she"
in yeshiva.

386
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,690
Hmm, well,
you've cooled down.

387
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,271
That's what you think.

388
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,815
(growling)

389
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,069
(chuckling)

390
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,440
You know, I rented
another tape

391
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,397
in case you felt better.

392
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,948
"The Erotic Adventures
of Hercules."

393
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,953
With Norman Fell as Zeus.

394
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,325
Whoo-hoo!

You can't get off.

407
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,813
We have five more continents
to visit.

408
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,483
Hey, Lis, I dare you
to drink the water.

409
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,902
I'm not sure
that is water.

410
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,071

Better stop it.

449
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,763
Can't you do something?

450
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,798
Hey. Surly only looks out
for one guy-- Surly.

451
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,143
-Sorry, Surly.
-Shut up.

452
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,389
SELMA:
Don't blame these kids.

453
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,970
It's not their fault.

454
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,727
I think their father
is missing a chromosome.

455
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,689
Miss Bouvier,
while we were rescuing this boy,

456
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,481
hoodlums made off
with three bumper cars!

457
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,475

458
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,777

459
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,866

George Washington

460
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,080
will ever be the same.

461
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,079
Ai yi, yi, yi, yi...

462
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:50,211
We found this one swimming
naked in the fermentarium.

463
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,290
I am the lizard queen!

464
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,957
Give her this,
and this,

465
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,756
and then these.

466
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,180
Thank you, doctor.

467
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,679
Oh, I'm not a doctor.

468
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,100
Come to Homercles.

469
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,720

470
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,807
I can't.
The beans will burn.

471
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,812
Homercles cares not for beans.

472
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,609
Hi, kids.
How was Duff Gardens?

473
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,612
Can't talk. Coming down.

474
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,605
Hmmm...

475
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,817
How do you do it, Homer?

476
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,537
You take an ordinary bed sheet,
fold it around like this--

477
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,288
No, I mean raising kids.

478
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,172
I just couldn't cut it today.

479
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,920
All I wanted was
a little version of me

480
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,923
that I could hold in my arms.

481
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,875
Oh, Jubjub.

482
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,513
When I went to pick him up,

483
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,264
Mom was trying to stab him
with a hat pin.
