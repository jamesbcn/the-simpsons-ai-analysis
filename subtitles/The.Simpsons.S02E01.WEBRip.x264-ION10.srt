-Bart Simpson?
-Oh!

33
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,325
Is your book report on
"Treasure Island" ready?

00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,416
Is it ready?
Ha! What a question.

35
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,053
Fellow students,
prepare to be dazzled.

36
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,881
Well, as Mrs. Krabappel
already mentioned

37
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,007
the name of the book that
I read was "Treasure Island."

38
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,385
It's about these... pirates.

39
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,812
Pirates with patches
over their eyes...

40
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,442
and shiny gold teeth...

41
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,399
and green birds
on their shoulders.

42
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,568
Did I mention this book

43
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,570
was written by a guy named
Robert Louis Stevenson?

44
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,323
And published by the good
people at McGraw-Hill.

45
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,066
So, in conclusion

46
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,078
on the Simpson scale
of one to ten

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,830
ten being the highest,
one being the lowest

48
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:46,581
and five being average,
I give this book a nine.

49
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,376
Ahem. Any questions?

50
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,419
No? Then I'll just sit down.

51
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,173
Bart, did you read the book?

52
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,295
Mrs. Krabappel,
I am insulted.

53
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,592
Is this a book report
or a witch hunt?

54
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:00,846
Then perhaps you'd like to tell us
the name of the pirate.

leave England?

(groaning)

178
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,212
(whistling)

179
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,012
(groaning)

180
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,931
What's the matter, son?

181
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,220
Sharp, stabbing pains
in my stomach.

182
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,675
Oh, dear.
I've heard of this.

183
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,675
Do you feel a shooting pain
in your arm?

184
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,387
-Both arms, ma'am.
-Mm-hmm.

185
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,938
Temporary loss of vision?

186
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,361
Who said that?
Come closer.

187
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,070
-(bell ringing)
-Yes, dear?

188
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,623
Ahh. Maybe, um,
one more dish.

189
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,408
Make it double cappuccino
chocolate fudge.

190
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,412
Ooh, your third bowl.

191
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,874
I think you may be
on the mend.

192
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,503
Is there anything else
I can get you?

193
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,620
Hmm...

194
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,536
Perhaps the TV?

195
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,335
Of course. Homer!

196
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,798
-What?
-Bring the television up.

197
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,549
-Bart's got his vision back.
-D'oh!

198
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:31,432
(straining) I wish I had
<i>amoria phlebitis.</i>

199
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,301
Everyone knows
you're faking it, Bart.

200
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,677
Well, everyone better
keep their mouth shut.

201
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,845
You're gonna have to fail that
history test sooner or later.

202
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,984
-I've got my bases covered.
-(phone line ringing)

203
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,362
Hey, Milhouse, what'd
I miss in school today?

204
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,279
Nothin' much. Lewis made Richard laugh
milk through his nose.

205
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,529
Oh, you don't say. What about
that history test, huh?

206
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,071
Piece of cake, huh?

207
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,874
Listen, what did you get
for number one?

208
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,739
Uh-huh.
Number two?

209
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,155
Oh, yeah, that sounds right.

210
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,445
Mm, mm-mm, mm, mm, mmm.

211
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,038
Ahh!

212
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,542
Here you go,
Mrs. Krabappel.

213
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,544
I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised.

214
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:08,837
Mm-hmm. Yep. Mm-hmm.

215
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,553
This test is worse
than Milhouse's exam.

216
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,474
Bart Simpson, I warned you.

217
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,563
This is the final straw.

218
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:19,138
Mr. And Mrs. Simpson, I think you know
our district psychiatrist

219
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,885
-Dr. J. Loren Pryor.
-Hey, Doctor J.

220
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,058
Hmph. I think what we have
on our hands here is a classic case

221
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,897
of what laymen refer to
as "fear of failure."

222
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,485
As a result,
Bart is an underachiever,

223
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:35,451
and yet he seems to be--
how should I put this--

224
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,043
-proud of it.
-Hmm.

225
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,749
One of his problems may be
his short attention span

226
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,409
which can lead to...

227
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,707
blah blah blah
blah blah blah...

228
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,631
-Uh-huh.
-Blah blah

229
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,090
-blah blah blah blah...
-Hmm...

230
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,510
Bart has failed his last
four exams in History.

231
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,631
Is there anything
you're not telling us?

232
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,718
No.

233
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,972
Every other student
in the class has shown

234
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,223
at least some form
of improvement,

235
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,386
and yet you
continue to struggle.

236
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,433
-Why is that?
-I don't know.

237
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,057
Look at these results--

238
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,404
Fifty-five,
Forty-two,

239
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,649
Twenty-six--
A 12 on state capitals?

240
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:11,242
Okay! Okay. Why are we dancing
around the obvious?

241
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,949
I know it. You know it.
I am dumb, okay? Dumb as a post!

242
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,410
You think I'm
happy about it?

243
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,949
There, there, Bart,
you're just a late bloomer.

244
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,914
Oh, I wish it were
that simple.

245
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,464
As shameful and as emotionally
crippling as it may be,

246
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,788
I'm afraid my recommendation
is for Bart Simpson to...

247
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,625
repeat the fourth grade.

248
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,710
What? You can't hold me back.
I'll do better. I promise.

249
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,126
-Promises, promises.
-Oh, sure. That'll be the day.

250
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,054
Well, maybe it
would help him

251
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,803
to be left back.

252
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,755
It won't be
so bad, Bart.

253
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,555
No, I mean it.
You can't hold me back.

254
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,349
I swear I'm gonna do better.

255
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,102
Look at my eyes.
See the sincerity?

256
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,234
See the conviction?
See the fear?

257
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:49,071
As God is my witness,
I can pass the fourth grade!

258
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,398
And if you don't, at least you'll
be bigger than the other kids.

259
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,815
(concerned groan)

260
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,622
Get off the bus, or forever
hold your peace, little dudes.

261
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,658
Otto, you know
I respect you.

262
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,495
I mean, you always
let us throw stuff at cars

263
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,580
and try to tip the bus
on sharp turns.

264
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,876
Damn thing never goes over,
does it?

265
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,250
So what's in your head,
little man?

266
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,757
Well, I been failing
a lot of tests recently.

267
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,680
-Yuh-huh?
-And now they're talking about

268
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,009
holding me back in the 4th grade
if I don't shape up.

269
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,636
That's it?
Hey, relax, man.

270
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,023
It could end up being the best thing
that ever happened to you.

271
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,311
I got held back in
the fourth grade myself.

272
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,265
Twice.

273
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,145
And look at me, man.
Now I drive the school bus.

274
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,863
DR. PRYOR:
<i>I'm afraid my recommendation</i>

275
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,527
<i>is for Bart Simpson to</i>
<i>repeat the fourth grade...</i>

276
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:44,076
(echoing) <i>repeat the fourth grade...</i>
<i>repeat the fourth grade...</i>

277
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,711
All right, class.
The topic is world literature.

278
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,750
What was the pirate's name
in "Treasure Island"?

279
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,626
Bart Simpson?

280
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,053
Look, lady,
I got a peptic ulcer,

281
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,682
a wife hawking me for a new car,
and I need a root canal.

282
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,010
Will you quit bugging me
about this stupid pirate?

283
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,136
Psst.
It's Long John Silver, Dad.

284
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,933
I heard that, Bart, Jr.

285
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,016
I want to see both of you
after class today.

286
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,693
D'oh!
Thanks a lot, son.

287
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,573
(infield chatter)

288
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,900
Yo, little help.

289
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,777
I said, "little help."

290
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,784
Throw me the ball,
Poindexter!

291
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,776
Oh, I'm sorry, Bart.

292
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,498
I'm unfamiliar with
the rules of your sport.

293
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,499
I didn't want to interfere
with a ball in play.

294
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,172
(laughing)

295
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,501
Well, back to the forecastle
of the Pequod.

296
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,878
-Hmm... hey, Martin?
-You have your ball.

297
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,335
I have nothing else
of value.

298
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,506
I need you to help me
get a passing grade.

299
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:46,305
Well, you do need someone's
help to get a passing grade,

300
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,730
but I don't know why
that someone should be me.

301
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:49,809
Because I can make it
so the other kids

302
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,524
don't laugh at you so much.

303
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,984
They... laugh at me?

304
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:58,565
I'd always considered myself
rather popular.

305
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,162
You're not.
Watch. Hnh!

306
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,158
(laughing)

307
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,740
But my speed with numbers,

308
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,906
my years of service
as a hall monitor,

309
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,706
my prizewinning
dioramas--

310
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,831
these things
mean nothing to them?

311
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,708
Perhaps another
demonstration. Hnh!

312
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,875
(kids laughing)

313
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,553
Very well. You have made
your point, Bart.

314
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,973
Then it's a deal?

315
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,551
Yes.

316
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,636
Alrighty, let's have a look-see
at your study area.

317
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,312
-Study area?
-Yes,

318
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,190
your sanctuary from
the hurly-burly of modern life.

319
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,308
Well, there's a desk
under that junk over there.

320
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:37,476
MARTIN: Oh, no, no, no, no.
This won't do at all.

321
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,186
We're gonna have to
clean up this room,

322
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,356
and we'll clearly need
a few ferns in here.

323
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,945
No study area is complete
without adequate plant life.

324
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,945
-No.
-No?

325
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,575
Only geeks
sit in the front seat.

326
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,412
From now on,
sit in the back row.

327
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,457
And that's not just
on the bus.

328
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,791
-It goes for school and church, too.
-Why?

329
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,246
So no one can see
what you're doing.

330
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,047
Oh! I think I understand.

331
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,471
The potential for mischief
varies inversely

332
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,801
with one's proximity
to the authority figure.

333
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,596
Well, yeah, but don't
say it like that.

334
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,310
(tires skidding)

335
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,854
-(crashing)
-MARTIN: Ooh!

336
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,209
Nnymm.

337
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,999
Nyahh!

338
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:39,996
Uhhnng!

339
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,047
-Aaah!
-Aaah!

340
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,341
Huh!

341
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,598
Pretty soon you will be ready
to try it with a real book.

342
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,601
(laughing)

343
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,024
Who would have thought

344
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,942
that pushing a boy into
the girls' lavatory

345
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,441
could be such a thrill?

346
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,822
The screams,
