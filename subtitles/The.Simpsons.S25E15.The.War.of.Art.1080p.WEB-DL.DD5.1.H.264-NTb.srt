(bird chirping)

00:00:24,044 --> 00:00:26,054
(groaning)

4
00:00:26,087 --> 00:00:27,261
Hm... hmm?!

5
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:29,671
"Lisa wants

6
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,943
"a dot-dot-dot

7
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:34,640
guinea pig"? Mm.

8
00:00:34,662 --> 00:00:36,363
(humming happily)

9
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,840
(curious grunt)

10
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,149
(yells)

11
00:00:42,162 --> 00:00:43,462
<i>(Homer smacking and chewing)</i>

12
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:45,032
(gulps, swallows)

13
00:00:45,286 --> 00:00:46,498
(curious grunt)

14
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:50,034
Hey, Homer, did you know that
guinea pigs are self-groomers?

15
00:00:50,057 --> 00:00:52,101
And when the get excited,
they jump straight up.

16
00:00:52,126 --> 00:00:54,733
- It's called "popcorning."
- Lisa got to you.

17
00:00:54,748 --> 00:00:56,616
I don't know how,
but she got to you.

18
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:57,881
(phone buzzing)

19
00:00:57,908 --> 00:00:59,695
(chiming)

20
00:01:00,088 --> 00:01:01,441
Emojis.

21
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:03,706
Now she's gone too far.

22
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:09,410
Lisa, your father and I are very
concerned about all this hinting.

23
00:01:09,456 --> 00:01:10,589
(groans)

24
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:12,491
I've never had a pet
of my very own.

25
00:01:12,497 --> 00:01:13,820
My clock is ticking.

26
00:01:13,848 --> 00:01:15,115
I don't want to be
one of those girls

27
00:01:15,135 --> 00:01:17,317
who waits till she's 16
to decide if she's ready,

28
00:01:17,357 --> 00:01:18,730
and then it's too late.

29
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,490
(both grunt)

30
00:01:19,503 --> 00:01:21,063
Well, we've
talked about it.

31
00:01:21,076 --> 00:01:23,096
And if you really
want a guinea pig,

32
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,340
you'll have to sign
this contract.

33
00:01:26,546 --> 00:01:28,512
"I, Lisa Simpson,
hereby promise

34
00:01:28,532 --> 00:01:31,308
to take full responsibility
for this dog, cat, other."

35
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:34,334
- Circle "other."
- "This includes feeding, bathing,

36
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:36,215
"cleaning of droppings
and barfings,

37
00:01:36,235 --> 00:01:39,706
and when the time comes,
burying or flushing."

38
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:43,212
Boilerplate, boilerplate, boilerplate.
We can skip all this litter box stuff.

39
00:01:43,232 --> 00:01:46,495
"If pet becomes Internet superstar,
all rights revert to father."

40
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:50,635
Sign here, here, initial here,
one more over here. And done.

41
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:53,154
Oh, my God! I'm
getting a guinea pig!

42
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:55,141
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

43
00:01:55,154 --> 00:01:57,244
The kid-parent contract.

44
00:01:57,271 --> 00:02:01,858
Unenforceable, yet you feel
like you didn't completely cave.

46
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,516
You're doing the right thing
adopting a rescue pig.

47
00:02:15,529 --> 00:02:17,575
You know, most of these
guys are rejects

48
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,248
from the big guinea-pig
mills in the Midwest.

49
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:22,516
Oh, I can't tell you
how many mill pigs

50
00:02:22,529 --> 00:02:26,035
we get in here who have
bumblefoot or the slobbers.

51
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:28,181
You don't have
children, do you?

52
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:29,849
This one whistled at me!

53
00:02:29,864 --> 00:02:31,844
Ooh, that could
be the one.

54
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:34,985
Oh, but that orange guy
looks like a pumpkin.

55
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:37,498
(gasps) But this
fellow is so fuzzy!

56
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:41,205
Well, they all
have their charms.

57
00:02:41,236 --> 00:02:43,303
This one's nibbling
a sunflower seed.

58
00:02:43,323 --> 00:02:46,690
Look at that hair. Aw, I just
want to comb it forever!

59
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:49,416
Have you seen a
pinker nose? (gasps)

60
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,016
I have now!

61
00:02:51,032 --> 00:02:54,260
Lisa, you've just
got to choose <i>one.</i>

62
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:55,168
Lisa?

63
00:02:55,181 --> 00:02:57,137
She's gone, honey.
She's gone.

64
00:02:57,157 --> 00:02:59,220
That one's fur looks
like a tuxedo!

65
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:02,349
A Band-Aid on
its tail, aw!

66
00:03:02,369 --> 00:03:03,089
(gasps)

67
00:03:03,114 --> 00:03:05,114
Albino!

68
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:08,813
I'm definitely getting this one.
Oh, but I forgot about this one.

69
00:03:08,826 --> 00:03:10,980
Oh, my God, I never
even saw this one!

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,347
(gasps)
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh...

71
00:03:14,788 --> 00:03:16,535
Maybe I should get
that sick one.

72
00:03:16,547 --> 00:03:18,584
If I don't, no one else will.
(gasps)

73
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:20,837
Bart, list your top
five, best to worst.

74
00:03:20,857 --> 00:03:22,230
No, no, no, no!
Worst to best.

75
00:03:22,255 --> 00:03:25,088
I just wish the gray one had
the brown one's personality.

76
00:03:25,544 --> 00:03:27,991
Okay, Dad, give me your phone. I
need to look at the pictures again.

77
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:31,885
Aw, aw, aw! Aw, aw!

78
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:37,555
Okay, this is the guinea pig
that will make me happy.

79
00:03:37,578 --> 00:03:39,418
She thinks she's decided.

80
00:03:39,437 --> 00:03:42,245
Don't say a thing.
Don't blow this.

81
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:45,834
Okay, now, you sure you
only want just one?

82
00:03:45,854 --> 00:03:48,207
They tend to do
better in pairs.

83
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:48,960
(gasps)

84
00:03:48,991 --> 00:03:50,918
I could get two?

85
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:52,378
(engine revs,
tires screech)

86
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,739
HOMER:
Farting tweakers rule!

87
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:59,865
I've tried to give Pokey a perfect
replica of his natural habitat.

88
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:02,378
Peruvian feather grass,
an Incan sleeping mat,

89
00:04:02,405 --> 00:04:06,125
and a portrait of Marisol Espinoza,
the Vice President of Peru.

90
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,993
Are you sure you didn't create
a perfect habitat for you?

91
00:04:09,023 --> 00:04:10,903
I wish I could
live in there.

92
00:04:10,924 --> 00:04:13,877
Well, there's plenty of
room because Pokey's gone.

93
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,744
(gasps)

94
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:16,315
Where'd he go?

95
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,655
(squeaking)

96
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,910
This looks like a job for...

97
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:26,695
fireplace tongs.

98
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:29,509
(tongs clang, Pokey squeaks)

99
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:31,561
No!

100
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,482
(Pokey squeaking)

101
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:39,370
Oh, my God!
He's in the walls!

102
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:41,426
I hear chewing.

103
00:04:41,452 --> 00:04:43,949
No, that's a much
bigger animal.

104
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,085
(grunts)

105
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:49,362
Kettle corn. The heroin
of the farmers' market.

106
00:04:49,369 --> 00:04:50,976
I've lost my guinea pig!

107
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,606
(squeaking, tapping nearby)

108
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,246
Pokey!

109
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:04,268
Our boat painting!

110
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:05,981
I'm sorry, Mom.

111
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:07,088
(groans)

112
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:08,808
That's okay, sweetheart.

113
00:05:08,836 --> 00:05:10,701
Your pig thingy
didn't mean it.

114
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,698
It's just, it felt comforting to
know that while we watched TV,

115
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:17,371
there was art going
on behind us.

116
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:18,758
(moans)

117
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,831
Oh, well, I guess
we have to go

118
00:05:20,857 --> 00:05:23,355
to an art gallery
and buy a new painting.

119
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:28,201
Sure, we could go to a fancy gallery
and spend a bunch of money, or...

120
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,675
Mm... hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm?

121
00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:32,980
Yeah, Milhouse played
the violin for years

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,633
until it turned out the vibrations
were screwing up his bones.

123
00:05:36,663 --> 00:05:38,890
Yeah, these seem great.
(sniffs)

124
00:05:38,912 --> 00:05:42,748
Oh, too bad someone
used cello rosin.

125
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,577
(groaning in frustration)

126
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,725
(gasping in awe)

127
00:05:49,035 --> 00:05:52,221
Oh, my gosh,
that's beautiful!

128
00:05:52,234 --> 00:05:55,048
I've never seen a painting
with a lighthouse before.

129
00:05:55,075 --> 00:05:55,902
(laughs)

130
00:05:55,927 --> 00:06:00,740
Oh, that. That was on the wall of
Kirk's bachelor pad, back when we were

131
00:06:00,753 --> 00:06:02,127
(whispers):
Separated.

132
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:03,716
Yeah, it's a great piece.

133
00:06:03,724 --> 00:06:07,871
I didn't have a mirror, so I shaved in
the reflection of the chrome frame.

134
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:10,031
This could be our new
living room painting.

135
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,671
I don't know.

136
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:14,319
How about this poster
of a really rocking jukebox?

137
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:17,784
You know it's rocking 'cause music
notes are coming out of it.

138
00:06:17,818 --> 00:06:19,631
Painting's only 20 bucks.

139
00:06:19,651 --> 00:06:21,931
Oh, please, Homie?

140
00:06:21,955 --> 00:06:24,168
I'll throw in
the tiny violins.

141
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:28,160
(Homer humming classical melody)

142
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:33,391
Oh, it looks great!

143
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:38,426
Well... to me, it looks like...
garbage salad.

144
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:40,846
But that's the great
thing about art.

145
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:44,458
Everyone can have their own
opinion about why it sucks.

146
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:48,558
I've got to get rid of this ugly
chrome frame from Kirk's bachelor bad.

147
00:06:48,564 --> 00:06:51,715
I hate to think of the things
this mirror has reflected.

148
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,121
Hmm!

149
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:57,999
Hey, look. There's a signature
that the frame covered up.

150
00:06:58,024 --> 00:07:01,221
"Johan Oldenveldt."

151
00:07:01,942 --> 00:07:03,249
Here he is!

152
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:05,865
"Johan Oldenveldt, painter.

153
00:07:05,886 --> 00:07:10,199
"Lived in Amsterdam, Paris. Prolific
early 20th century naturalist."

154
00:07:10,218 --> 00:07:13,052
Ooh, I think this was painted
by someone famous.

155
00:07:13,078 --> 00:07:14,725
Maybe it's valuable.

156
00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:16,675
We should have
it appraised.

157
00:07:16,695 --> 00:07:19,955
Pfft! You guys are crazy. I
never even heard of that guy.

158
00:07:19,975 --> 00:07:23,468
It's not like it was painted
by Leonardo Da Vinci Code.

159
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:26,127
Now, here's what
makes art valuable...

160
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:31,053
One: Nudity. Two: Holograms. Three:
Something terrible happening to Jesus.

161
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:37,817
Ah yes, seascape,
marvelous natural light,

162
00:07:37,852 --> 00:07:40,627
classic use of gouache.

163
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:41,681
You're right.

164
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,390
This is an early-career
Oldenveldt.

165
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,283
- Quite valuable.
- Oh, my God!

166
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:51,575
I expect it to go somewhere
between 80 to $100,000.

167
00:07:51,592 --> 00:07:52,779
(gasps)
Nobody touch it!

168
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:54,359
Bart, stop looking at it!

169
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:57,301
- But I want to see it!
- No, you'll wear it out!

170
00:07:57,323 --> 00:08:00,452
Baby, you saw something in this
painting, and you were right.

171
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:03,707
Wow, the Van Houtens
owned this for years,

172
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,800
and never knew how
much it was worth.

173
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:10,020
Think how happy they'll be when we
sell it and split the money with them.

174
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:13,485
Split it? Whoa! Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa,

175
00:08:13,498 --> 00:08:16,419
whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

176
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,051
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa...

177
00:08:19,057 --> 00:08:20,246
whoa!

178
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,738
(cell phone ringing)

179
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,331
HOMER: <i>Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

180
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:26,651
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

181
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:28,315
Oh!

182
00:08:32,343 --> 00:08:35,682
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

183
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,276
Split it with them?

184
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:40,889
Kirk and Luann didn't know what the
painting was worth when they sold it.

185
00:08:40,908 --> 00:08:43,613
Yes, they sold it to us.

186
00:08:43,642 --> 00:08:45,858
So, now it's our painting.

187
00:08:45,878 --> 00:08:49,954
We can hang it on our wall, cut
eyeholes in it to spy on people.

188
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:54,238
Or sell it for lots of money
which we keep.

189
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:55,458
For ourselves?

190
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:57,349
This dude gets it.

191
00:08:57,415 --> 00:08:58,705
(groans)

192
00:08:58,732 --> 00:09:01,807
But the Van Houtens
are our friends.

193
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:02,814
Are they, Marge?

194
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,517
If you think about it, aren't
they really just the parents

195
00:09:05,537 --> 00:09:08,266
of a kid who happens
to hang out with our kid?

196
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:10,381
All our friends
are like that.

197
00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:13,078
Well, how would you feel
if we sold them something

198
00:09:13,091 --> 00:09:14,978
that turned out
to be valuable?

199
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,583
I would feel A) Happy
for their good fortune,

200
00:09:17,596 --> 00:09:19,337
B) Proud to know
rich people,

201
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:23,085
and C) Grateful for an opportunity
to learn from a mistake.

202
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:24,864
(door bell chimes)
MARGE: <i>How about this?</i>

203
00:09:24,888 --> 00:09:29,058
What if we give the Van
Houtens 25% of the money?

204
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,351
Then they'll just be mad about
the 65% that we're keeping.

205
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:37,359
- Marge, you like kindness, right?
- Sure.

206
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:41,238
So, even if we gave Kirk and
Luann some of the money,

207
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:45,359
the knowledge of what they could
have had will eat away at them,

208
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:48,732
like piranhas devouring
a wounded yeti.

209
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,587
It's kinder never
to tell them.

210
00:09:51,607 --> 00:09:53,394
Okay, I see your point.

211
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,077
We should sell the painting,
keep all the money,

212
00:09:56,108 --> 00:09:58,848
and never, ever tell
the Van Houtens.

213
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,901
Mm-hmm!

214
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:01,727
(deep inhale)

215
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:03,796
(gasping)

216
00:10:03,826 --> 00:10:05,327
(deep inhale)

217
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:06,849
(Marge and Homer gasping)

218
00:10:07,463 --> 00:10:09,297
What'll it take to
buy your silence?

219
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:10,404
Hmm.

220
00:10:10,426 --> 00:10:13,947
Okay, Milhouse, the guys in back
are shining up your new bike.

221
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,043
And all I have to do
is not say anything

222
00:10:16,056 --> 00:10:18,432
about some painting
to my Mom and Dad?

223
00:10:18,447 --> 00:10:22,316
Oh, sweetie, you want your
parents to be happy, don't you?

224
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:24,072
I guess.

225
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:26,199
(laughing):
"I guess"!

226
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:27,486
You're funny!

227
00:10:27,515 --> 00:10:29,655
No wonder Lisa's
in love with you.

228
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:32,421
- She is?!
- She is?!

229
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:36,746
So, if I keep my mouth shut, you
get me new wheelie sneakers,

230
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:38,904
and Bart agrees to promote
and encourage use

231
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,540
of my new cool
nickname, "C.J."

232
00:10:41,566 --> 00:10:43,427
(Homer grunts)

233
00:10:43,452 --> 00:10:44,686
You got it, Ceej.

234
00:10:44,707 --> 00:10:46,374
(doorbell rings)

235
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:49,946
You found out that painting
was worth big bucks,

236
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:51,513
and you weren't
gonna tell us?!

237
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:53,946
I don't know what
you're talking about.

238
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:55,489
(loud whisper):
Hide the treasure!

239
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:58,222
I'm sorry, Mr. S.
I cracked!

240
00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:02,190
We had a deal. And now
we've got nothing!

241
00:11:02,211 --> 00:11:04,612
(blows)

242
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:08,831
We considered you
our friends.

243
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:12,338
We trusted you! I let Homer
use our master bathroom!

244
00:11:12,365 --> 00:11:14,382
Then you stab us
in the back!

245
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,305
If you knew you sold a
valuable painting for nothing,

246
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:21,300
how could you live
with yourselves?

247
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,805
We were just trying
to be... kind.

248
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:26,580
Kind?! You call it kind
to give us nothing?

249
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:29,594
We were gonna treat you to dinner
at an upscale chain restaurant

250
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:32,184
and never explain why,
but now forget it!

251
00:11:32,197 --> 00:11:35,936
- Oh, so that's how it is!
- That's exactly how it is.

252
00:11:35,953 --> 00:11:38,795
- Oh, is it?!
- Oh, it is!

253
00:11:38,884 --> 00:11:39,551
(clears throat)

254
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:42,269
Luann, I hope we're
still on Thursday

255
00:11:42,295 --> 00:11:44,939
for collecting used cell
phones for the troops.

256
00:11:44,952 --> 00:11:47,066
I don't think you
need any help.

257
00:11:47,092 --> 00:11:49,493
You're so good at...
collecting.

258
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,443
Oh!

259
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:55,418
Oh, that was cold, Luann!

260
00:11:55,444 --> 00:11:57,265
So cold!

261
00:11:57,286 --> 00:11:58,813
Brr!

262
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,588
Sarcastic brr!

263
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:04,270
See what happens
when we get greedy?

264
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,792
Honey, there's something
I want to show you.

265
00:12:06,818 --> 00:12:08,430
An ATM receipt?

266
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:11,447
I don't know whose this is. I found
it next to the cash machine,

267
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,897
and I've always kept it.
Look at the balance.

268
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:15,936
Five figures!

269
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:19,260
With that painting, we could
have what these people have:

270
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,196
A money cushion.

271
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:24,026
No more living
paycheck to paycheck,

272
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:26,785
one lost retainer away
from the gutter.

273
00:12:26,805 --> 00:12:30,175
I could write a check
with today's date on it.

274
00:12:30,195 --> 00:12:32,125
That's the cushion.

275
00:12:33,268 --> 00:12:34,502
♪

276
00:12:34,576 --> 00:12:35,963
Tonight, a special report.

277
00:12:35,976 --> 00:12:40,188
Fat cat art experts take advantage
of John and Jane Yard Sale.

278
00:12:40,216 --> 00:12:42,766
So, would you characterize
your friend of many years

279
00:12:42,786 --> 00:12:46,981
cheating you out of your painting as no
big deal, or a devastating betrayal?

280
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:49,273
Oh, definitely
betrayal, Kent.

281
00:12:49,293 --> 00:12:52,674
Interesting. So if you see the
Simpsons walking down your street,

282
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,581
lock your doors and hide...
your friendship.

283
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:57,494
Great! Now we're raccoons,

284
00:12:57,507 --> 00:13:00,044
the masked bandits
of the animal world!

285
00:13:00,075 --> 00:13:03,188
Don't worry. No one's gonna
see this stupid show.

286
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:04,661
(both gasp, tires squeal)

287
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:06,079
(gasps)

288
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:10,344
The whole town's
turned against us!

289
00:13:10,366 --> 00:13:12,601
(engine revs,
tires squeal)

290
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:18,399
Ooh, a support rock!

291
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:21,474
This one's against us.
This one's for us.

292
00:13:21,494 --> 00:13:24,426
For, for, against,
for, against...

293
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:26,986
We don't even get this
many Christmas cards.

294
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:29,268
(all clamoring)

295
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:31,446
(all gasp)

296
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:34,966
There they are, the
Masterpiece Thievers!

297
00:13:34,984 --> 00:13:36,417
Ah, shut your bone hole!

298
00:13:36,438 --> 00:13:38,459
That painting belongs
to the Simpsons!

299
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:41,080
Sharing is what makes
a community strong!

300
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,513
All sales are final!

301
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:45,160
- Keep it! (clamoring)
- Finders keepers, moron!

302
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:48,214
You really think we're still
doing the right thing?

303
00:13:48,236 --> 00:13:51,217
Just close your eyes and
think of the cushion.

304
00:13:55,517 --> 00:13:58,997
First lot: "Untitled Landscape"
by Johan Oldenveldt,

305
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:01,755
from the Collection of Homer J.
And Marge B. Simpson.

306
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,778
Let's open the bidding
at $80,000.

307
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:09,747
The paddles, Marge!
Look at the paddles!

308
00:14:13,482 --> 00:14:15,722
WOMAN:
Stop the auction!

309
00:14:15,751 --> 00:14:17,983
That painting
belongs to me!

310
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,333
- (crowd gasps, murmurs)
- Dawn?

311
00:14:19,352 --> 00:14:22,716
Good to see you
again, Beef Kirky.

312
00:14:22,732 --> 00:14:24,260
Who is this woman?

313
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:29,223
Uhhhhhh...

314
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:32,919
While you two were separated,
Kirk and I used to be friends...

315
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:34,945
with banana-fits.

316
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:35,857
(Homer groans)

317
00:14:35,878 --> 00:14:39,214
You told me you didn't see
anyone during our separation.

318
00:14:39,248 --> 00:14:44,629
Uhhhhhh...

319
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:48,240
Madam, are you saying this
painting belongs to you?

320
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:50,140
Kirk stole it from me!

321
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:53,728
But I didn't know it was valuable
till I saw the story on TV.

322
00:14:53,743 --> 00:14:56,871
What?! I bought that
painting! She's lying!

323
00:14:56,898 --> 00:14:57,578
(gavel raps)

324
00:14:57,603 --> 00:15:01,483
The auction is on hold until we
can determine the true ownership.

325
00:15:03,244 --> 00:15:04,932
Our cushion!

326
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,371
Don't bother
coming home, Kirk!

327
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:08,276
Aw!

328
00:15:08,297 --> 00:15:10,015
See what your
greed has done?

329
00:15:10,028 --> 00:15:13,288
- Ow! - Anybody want to
give me a ride home?

330
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:15,396
- Going once? Going twice?
- (bangs gavel)

331
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,678
Sold! To the
lonely auctioneer!

332
00:15:18,486 --> 00:15:19,686
Ah!

333
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:22,036
(cheering, laughter)

334
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,809
Thanks for
taking me in, man.

335
00:15:28,835 --> 00:15:32,062
I guess I can't help but
feel fully responsible.

336
00:15:32,087 --> 00:15:35,788
Oh, Luann, I'll never gaze
from my thick eyeglasses

337
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:38,556
into your thick
eyeglasses ever again.

338
00:15:38,574 --> 00:15:41,945
What you need, my friend,
is a Canadian Duff.

339
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:43,156
Beauty, eh?

340
00:15:43,164 --> 00:15:47,134
So... why <i>does</i> that chick
think she owns the painting?

341
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:52,382
Oh, Dawn and I went on a vacation to
a resort island called Isla Verde.

342
00:15:52,407 --> 00:15:54,461
I bought the painting
in a café,

343
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:57,959
but that night she ran off
with a parasailing instructor.

344
00:15:57,986 --> 00:15:59,439
Not your fault, man.

345
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,748
Those parasailing guys take
whatever they want.

346
00:16:02,771 --> 00:16:04,351
It was never her painting.

347
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:08,318
That woman will say anything to keep
herself in electric cigarettes.

348
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:11,349
And I'd go back to that
Café Artiste to prove it,

349
00:16:11,355 --> 00:16:14,528
but nothing's gonna
get me Luann back.

350
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:18,669
(snoring)

351
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:21,937
Okay, all I gotta do is take
a quick ferry to Isla Verde,

352
00:16:21,963 --> 00:16:25,123
find Café Artiste, and they'll
back up Kirk's story.

353
00:16:25,143 --> 00:16:28,704
That will prove the painting
was his... and now ours.

354
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:32,698
Oh, Homer Simpson, that painting
has torn the town apart,

355
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,806
destroyed Kirk
and Luann's marriage,

356
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:37,986
and everyone's very
worried about Milhouse.

357
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:41,882
He's been playing Dancing Revolution
for hours, but the TV is off.

358
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,321
But our cushion!

359
00:16:47,349 --> 00:16:50,113
That picture has brought out
the worst in everyone!

360
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:54,170
Please! Just let it go!

361
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:56,677
(grunting)

362
00:16:56,878 --> 00:16:58,879
You're not gonna
let it go, are you?

363
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,453
I wish I knew how.

364
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:04,683
This is so exciting!

365
00:17:04,706 --> 00:17:07,279
My first time
establishing provenance!

366
00:17:07,305 --> 00:17:08,839
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just remember,

367
00:17:08,852 --> 00:17:12,427
if your mother asks, I took
you to a wine tasting.

368
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:15,058
That's a terrible thing
for a father to do.

369
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:16,981
That's why she'll
believe it.

370
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:22,490
Hmm, this quaint artist community
has gotten a little touristy.

371
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:24,392
♪

372
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:31,710
Excuse me. We're trying
to find Café Artiste.

373
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:35,770
Ah, yes. Top of the hill. Three
discos up, four gelatos on the left.

374
00:17:35,797 --> 00:17:39,401
You can't miss it. It's right between
the disco and the gelato place.

375
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,219
Mmm. Hmm.

376
00:17:41,232 --> 00:17:42,811
Mm-mm!
(door bell jingles)

377
00:17:43,036 --> 00:17:44,576
Mm...

378
00:17:44,602 --> 00:17:46,441
Welcome to Café Artiste!

379
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,300
Would you like
a glass of Strupo?

380
00:17:48,313 --> 00:17:52,320
It's a liqueur made of fermented capers,
the official drink of the island.

381
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:54,191
Mmm! Sounds delicious.

382
00:17:55,135 --> 00:17:56,205
It's not.

383
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:59,253
Hey, a friend of mine, uh,
bought a painting here.

384
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:01,926
Oh, yes, I remember
that painting.

385
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:03,952
And that is the
man I sold it to.

386
00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:06,741
And that man
sold it to me!

387
00:18:06,763 --> 00:18:08,576
That proves the
painting is mine!

388
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:12,685
And nothing can stop me from selling
it and keeping all the money!

389
00:18:12,704 --> 00:18:14,808
I love art!

390
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,033
MAN:
Art?

391
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:17,872
What do you
know about art?

392
00:18:17,885 --> 00:18:20,439
You don't even know
who painted that picture.

393
00:18:20,463 --> 00:18:23,130
Yes, I do. It's a
Johan Oldenveldt.

394
00:18:23,153 --> 00:18:25,546
Wrong! It's a me!

395
00:18:25,576 --> 00:18:27,496
- A what?
- I painted it!

396
00:18:27,518 --> 00:18:29,244
Me, Klaus Ziegler!

397
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:30,465
Who?

398
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:33,415
- Mm!
- Oh!

399
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:36,651
This is where I painted
your so-called Oldenveldt.

400
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:37,711
Prove it.

401
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,477
Aw, crap!

402
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,389
You're a forger?

403
00:18:43,408 --> 00:18:45,885
"Forger" is such
a cruel word.

404
00:18:45,923 --> 00:18:47,690
I'm an art forger.

405
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:50,119
Your painting was an
early, clumsy effort

406
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:53,608
which I gave to the café owner
to pay off my Strupo tab.

407
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,072
Whew!

408
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,495
Then why did the auction
house say it was real?

409
00:18:59,508 --> 00:19:03,897
I have fooled galleries around the
world with my loving imitations.

410
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:06,555
Ziegler! Ziegler! Ziegler!

411
00:19:06,584 --> 00:19:09,427
Ziegler!
Ziegler! Ziegler!

412
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,747
What you do is horrible...

413
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:16,029
ripping off geniuses who spent
years perfecting their styles.

414
00:19:16,053 --> 00:19:18,154
Perhaps you are the
one who is horrible.

415
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:18,918
What?!

416
00:19:18,944 --> 00:19:21,341
You only cared about that
painting when you thought

417
00:19:21,347 --> 00:19:23,774
it was created by
someone famous.

418
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:29,454
Well, no, but <i>now</i> when I look
at it, all I see is a fraud.

419
00:19:29,474 --> 00:19:31,227
Beauty is beauty.

420
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:35,200
My forgeries give pleasure to
people all over the world.

421
00:19:35,227 --> 00:19:37,962
<i>The only real question
to ask about art,</i>

422
00:19:37,982 --> 00:19:42,289
<i>whether it's in the Louvre or on a
freshman's wall at Cal State Fullerton</i>

423
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:45,168
is, "Did it move you?"

424
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:47,042
But, you still, I mean...

425
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,905
Oh, I suppose
you're right.

426
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:52,972
What if I never liked the painting
and only wanted it for money?

427
00:19:53,003 --> 00:19:54,704
Then you, I respect.

428
00:19:54,738 --> 00:19:55,856
(groans)

429
00:19:55,882 --> 00:19:58,082
Oh, great. The
painting is worthless,

430
00:19:58,095 --> 00:19:59,828
(glass shatters)
this was all for nothing,

431
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,323
and when Marge finds out,
she's gonna kill me.

432
00:20:02,342 --> 00:20:05,715
Well, on that front, perhaps
I can be of assistance.

433
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:07,974
If there's one thing
art is good for,

434
00:20:07,985 --> 00:20:12,336
it's to melt the frost which
often hardens a woman's heart.

435
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:13,895
While you're at it...

436
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:17,907
could you make me a couple more?
I'll pay you in Strupo.

437
00:20:28,138 --> 00:20:30,038
(sighs)

438
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:31,226
Perfect.

439
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:33,706
Oh, now that's art.

440
00:20:33,744 --> 00:20:34,617
(grunts)

441
00:20:34,642 --> 00:20:35,948
Rocking.
