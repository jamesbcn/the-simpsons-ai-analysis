{\an8}Huh? "Springfield University Homecoming."

14
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:35,221
{\an8}Finally, a chance to relive
my golden college years.

15
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,893
{\an8}Dad, you only took one course.

16
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,641
{\an8}Remember my love affair with Ali McGraw?

17
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:43,194
{\an8}She used to call me "Preppy".
Then she died.

18
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,979
{\an8}Oh, there's a homecoming parade,
A cocktail party...

19
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:50,435
{\an8}Then the big game between Springfield-U
and Springfield A&M.

20
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,737
{\an8}I hate Springfield-U so much.

21
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,912
{\an8}You went to Springfield-U. You hate A&M.

22
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,081
{\an8}So much.

{\an8}You college boys are only

{\an8}Whoa... you're supposed
to hang your necktie

{\an8}on the doorknob
if you got a girl in the room.

29
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,058
{\an8}Or a ski hat if you've got
a picture of a girl.

-Oh, my, yes.

33
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,775
{\an8}I'm on a secret project
that I'm not at liberty

34

{\an8}to divulge... (coughs) Cyborgs.

35
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,487
{\an8}I invented a program that downloads porn

36
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,451
{\an8}off the Internet one million times faster.

37
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,832
{\an8}Does anybody need that much porno?

38
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,699
{\an8}Oh... one million times.

00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,463
{\an8}Yeah, so because of me

41
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,094
{\an8}all the dorms now have security phones.

all-American place kicker

46
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,643
-Anton Lubchenko.
-(audience clapping)

47
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,635
In home country, growing up in filth

48
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,608
Lubchenko dreams to play U.S.A. football.

49
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,279
On my father's deathbed
he made me promise to--

50
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,188
(Dean clears throat)

51
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,198
Long story short, go Springfield-U.

52
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,623
Yes. Thank you, Anton.

53
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,198
Now, folks, a seven and five
football season

54
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,494
doesn't come cheap
and this is a fund-raiser.

56
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,209
{\an8}Seal the exits.

57

DEAN: Thank you, thank you.
Come on, hurry up.

58
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,423
All right now, let's empty our pockets.

59
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,585
-Make me.
-Professor Rocco... Chancellor Knuckles...

60
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,346
Wait... (whimpering) OK...

61
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,928
-(whimpering) All right, OK.
-Get every dime.

was just a ruse to get our money.

66

That Dean is going to get
an indignant e-mail.

67
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,197
You should do it with bold, red letters.

68
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,070
My computer has 512 shades of red.

everything I taught you?

70
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,620

71
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,873

Oh, this is going to be so great.

75
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,715
I think I know that guy.

76
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,430
He ran over the Dean five years ago.

77
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,550
Punch up that picture.

78
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,097
All right, now age the picture five years.

That's him. Good work.

80
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,603
Now, let's see who's having
sex at the library.

81
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,556
Aw, they scrambled it.

82
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,066
So when Dean Peterson opens his door

83
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,860
This bucket of super glue is going to drop
right on his head.

Oh, real original. Who did this?

87
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,576
Kappa Gamma Tau.

88
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,623

{\an8}Oh... Sorry, dad, it just won't budge.

I tried greasing the bucket with bacon fat

97
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,654
but your father kept eating it.

98
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,189
Oh, couldn't you try a non-delicious fat?

99
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,733
{\an8}(crying) Oh... there's no such thing.

101
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,033
Hmm... I'm afraid it's hopeless.

102
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,662
Beneath that bucket,
he's more glue than man.

103
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,740
So he's stuck like this forever?

104
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,235
Oh, now don't fret.

105
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,997
These days, the victims of comedy traumas

106
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,369

can still lead rich, full lives.

110

111
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,147
{\an8}OK, hang on, Homer.
Two eye holes coming up.

112

175
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,821
(all gasps)

176
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:51,411
-I see the light. It burns!
-Hallelujah!

177
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:55,699
Behold... This child has the power.

178
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,695
ALL: Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!

179
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,996
{\an8}HOMER: Uh, miracle boy...

180
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,331
I believe I had hair. Oh, here they are.

181
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,716
Ah, you two were great tonight.

182
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,340
You didn't bite me or anything.

183
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,426
-Oh, how's that little rattle doing?
-(rattling)

184
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,432
(chuckles)

185
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,218
{\an8}Excuse me, Brother Faith. I got to know...

186
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,807
How did you really get
the bucket off my dad's head?

187
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:24,313
Well, I didn't, son... you did.
God gave you the power.

188
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,017
{\an8}Really? Hmmm...

189
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,107
{\an8}I would think he would
want to limit my power.

190
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,442
(chuckles) Oh, yes, Lord.

191
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,908
When I was your age,
I was a hell-raiser, too.

192
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,659
My slingshot was my cross.

193
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,240
But I saw the light
and changed my wicked ways.

194
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,447
{\an8}I figure I'll go for the life of sin

195
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,788
{\an8}followed by the presto-chango
deathbed repentance.

196
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,793
Wow, that's a good angle.

197
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,035
But that's not God's angle.

198
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,128
Why not spend your life
helping people instead?

199
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,134
Then you're also covered
in case of sudden death.

200
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,467
{\an8}Full coverage. Hmmm...

201
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,603
Then I said, "I have the power!"

202
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,470
And the bucket came off.

203
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,977
ALL: Cool! Wow!

204
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,478
Can you heal me?

205
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,850
I can't breathe good
and it makes me sleepy.

206
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,687
I'll give it a whirl, Ralphie boy.

207
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,283
-Devil be gone!
-Ow!

208
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,778
-My milk money and my milk.
-ALL: Ew!

209
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,115
You did it, Bart.

210
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,949
He really does have the power.

211
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,995
Go forth and spread the word!

212
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,831
-Spread it!
-(kids yelling)

213
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,294
Bart, I hope you don't believe
your own hype.

214
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,956
{\an8}Number of miracles performed by Bart-02.

215
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,296
{\an8}Number performed by Lisa-zero.

216
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,722
How can you believe all this mumbo-jumbo?

217
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,220
The bucket came off dad's head

218
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,222
because the bright lights heated it

219
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,564
causing the metal to expand.

220
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,810
{\an8}"Heat makes metal expand."

221
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,642
{\an8}Now who's talking mumbo-jumbo?

222
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:51,114
{\an8}(grunts) I can't come up with an idea
for my homecoming float.

223
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,026
{\an8}-Do it for me.
-What have you got so far?

224
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,818
HOMER: Look at Moe dance <i>♪ Aloha Moe ♪</i>

225
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,038
{\an8}That's nice, but maybe
your homecoming float

226
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,908
{\an8}should have something to do with college.

227
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,155
Yeah, you're right.

228
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,877
{\an8}I think Godzilla's bigger than superman.

229
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,880
Pfft... it's not to scale.

230
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,505
In his letter to the Corinthians

231
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,551
Paul instructed them to send ten copies

232
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,966
to the Thessalonians and the Ephesians.

233
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,516
But the Ephesians broke
the chain and were punished...

234
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,351
I got two words for this sermon...

235
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,306
(snores) (whistles)

236
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,357
Am I boring you, Bart?

237
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,820
Well, to be honest, yes.

238
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,861
Hey, I'm doing the best
with the material I have.

239
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:37,856
But church can be fun.

240
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,027
-(all laughing)
-No, really.

241
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,906
It can be a crazy party
with clouds and lasers and miracles...

242
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,333
And chilIi fries!

243
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,252
A real preacher knows
how to bring the bible alive

244
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,631
through music and dancing and tae-bo!

245
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,960
(humming tune)

246
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,505
(congregation cheering)

247
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,719
He's kicking it old school!

248
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,640
Never give them an opening.

249
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,521
Three, two, one, pull!

250
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,018
(grunting)

251
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,736
That exterminator tent will be perfect
for your revival meeting.

252
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,238
-(coughs)
-Hmm, maybe we should air it out a little.

Ah, ha. Excuse me, neighbor.

256
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,294
Ah, yeah, I couldn't help but notice

257
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,711
you picked pretty much all of my flowers.

258
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,921
Can't make a float without flowers.

259
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,631
Oh, sure enough

260
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,261
but, uh, did you have to salt the earth

261
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,878
so nothing would ever grow again?

262
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,335
(chuckling sheepishly) Yeah.

263
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,046

264
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,392

I'm so sorry.

That's OK. You can just heal me again,
right?

313
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,358
{\an8}I don't think I can.

00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,908
Please?

315
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,621
This cast is real itchy
and I tried to scratch

316
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,662
and the fork got stuck in there.

317
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,916
And I think there
was some food on the fork.

318
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,708
Ugh. OK, I'll see what I can do.

Milhouse, I can't help you.

323
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,352
I am no healer.

324
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,058
Could you tell my mom I'm here?

325
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:38,812
Big game fever is reaching a fevered pitch
as the fevered rivalry

326
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,396
between Springfield-U. and Springfield A&M

327
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:45,032
spreads like wild fever.
This... this is writing?

328
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,200
I'm sorry, uncle Kent.
I lost my thesaurus.

329
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,280
(muttering) "Thesaurus"...
You'll lose more than that.

330
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,617
In preparation for the big game,
Springfield stadium has caught

331

additional-seating-capacity
fever. (chuckles) (growling)

Whoo-hoo! Go S.U.!

333
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,503
A&M is going to kick
your ivy-covered butts.

334
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,796
Yeah? Well, you went to a cow college.

335
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,840
Oh, you're only calling us a cow college

336
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,554
'cause we were founded by a cow.

337
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,640
Whoa, Nellie, we have ourselves
a barn burner today.

338
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,806
Welcome to the 117th dust-up between

339
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,105
the Snorting Wwine of Springfield A&M

340
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,569
and the Springfield University
Nittany Tide.

341
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,280
Oh-ho, doctor, break out
the hickory switch.

342
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,322
OK, who needs another lamb rack?

343
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,445
Lisa, Ham hock? Tri-tip?

344
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,004
Do we have any food that wasn't
brutally slaughtered?

345
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,208
Well, I think the veal might
have died of loneliness.

346
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,328
Well, hang on to your hoop-skirts, folks,

347
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,126
because Anton Lubchenko
is going to be kicking higher

348
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,050
than a mule on payday.

349
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,416
Oh, Land O'Lakes! Take that, ozone layer!

350
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,880
Oof!

351
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,138
(all grunting)

352
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,346
ANNOUNCER: What a glorious day
to be that man's foot.

353
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,433
(kissing)

354
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,225
(whistle blows)

355
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,571
Whoa, Annie get your radar gun!

356
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,779
'Cause that tamale
was one tall drink of water.

357
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,821
Wow! He should have his foot insured
by Lloyd's of London.

358
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,906
(slurring words) You just know what
everyone should do, don't you, Marge?

359
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,163
-(buzzer sounds)
-Now, ladies and gentlemen

360
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,995
pour a little cider on those peepers

361
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,830
'cause here comes the halftime parade!

362
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,626
(gasping) I forgot my float!
Quick! Pass me down!

363
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,301
-(crowd grunting)
-HOMER: (laughing) Stop that!

364
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,176
OK, Lis, if they don't have tabbouleh

365
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,180
what's your second choice?

366
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,761
They'll have tabbouleh.

367
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,136
You're the miracle boy
with the healing hands

368
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,643
Arr... en't ya?

369
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,305
{\an8}Nah, I don't do that anymore.

370
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,103
So I guess I'll have to see someone else

371
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,727
about my crippling depression.

372
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,572
(softly) Arrgh.

373
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,243
{\an8}Wow... And I thought he had it all.

374
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,493
<i>♪ I've had ♪</i>

375
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,243
<i>♪ The halftime of my life ♪</i>

376
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,786
<i>♪ And I owe it all to S. U. ♪</i>

377
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,871
An overdue tribute to halftime itself.

378
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,287
And as those lumbering ships
of the gridiron

379
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,876
sail off into our memories

380
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,761
The players return to the field.

381
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,547
HOMER: Wait... hang on!

382
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,182
ANNOUNCER: Then... what's this?

383
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,678
(engine misfiring)

384
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,260
Wait, wait! I got a float, too!

385
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,056
Listen up, 'cause I got to
explain a lot it!

386
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,810
(all booing)

387
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:22,942
Boo?

388
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,268
Hey, look out! He's nuts!

389
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,728
{\an8}Out of the way, Baryshnikov!

390
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,895
{\an8}(yelling in Russian)

391
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,435
-(tires screeching)
-(all gasping)

392
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,317
He hit the star player!

393
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,321
Dad has the worst luck when he's drinking.

394
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,157
-Now, does this hurt?
-Aah!

395
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,544
Just a simple yes or no.

396
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,290
Oh, I only wanted to show
my school spirit.

397
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,384
I wagered a large sum on the performance
of that scholar-athlete.

398
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,302
{\an8}(sobbing) No! Wit! I got a kid
who's a miracle worker.

399
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,845
{\an8}He'll heal him up real good.

400
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,388
Well, he'd better, or else...

401
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,682
Or else what?

402
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,429
Oh, right, the ice pick.

403
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,480
Bart, I need a miracle!

404
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,284
Sorry, dad. I can't just
magically cure a broken leg.

405
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,728
(Fat Tony clears throat)

406
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,147
(shrieks) Please, Bart!

407
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,067
You've got to use your powers.

408
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,156
I'm begging you.

409
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,240
(Lubchenko groaning)

410
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,535
Son, I'm afraid that leg
is hanging by a thread.

411
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,621
-Lubchenko must return to game.
-(chuckling)

412
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,498
Oh, your playing days are over, my friend.

413
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,915
But you can always
fall back on your degree in...

414
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,014
Communications! Oh, dear Lord!

415
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,840
I know... is phony major. (sobbing)

416
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,847
Lubchenko learn nothing,
nothing! (sobbing)

417
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,020
{\an8}Bart, do your thing.

418
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:50,021
(gulping) OK, God, if you did give me
a power, let it work now...

419
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,815
Not just for me, but for my dad.

420
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,284
Heal, heal, heal!

421
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,992
Oh, doctor, with S.U. behind
and seconds left

422
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,243
my supply of homespun sayings

423
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,286
is lower than a doodlebug
in aunt Tillie's root cellar.

424
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,370
So we'll...

425
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,615
Oh, jumpin' crawdaddies!

426
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,917
Is that Lubchenko coming back
on the field?

427
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,381
(all cheering)

428
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:17,172
{\an8}Bart did it! And they're going
to try for a field goal!

429
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,967
A field goal? Hmm... 19, 20, 21.

430
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,472
(gasping) That would win the game!

431
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,156
(effort grunt)

432
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,569
(all cheering)

433
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,873
Uh?

434
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,116
(all groaning)

435
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,627
Uh?

436
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,668
(whistle blows)

437
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,086
(all cheering)

438
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,295
I did it! I did it!

439
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,546
{\an8}My leg... it broke off!

440
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,387
MAN: Yes!

441
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,941
(grunts) (chuckles)

442
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,113
(groans like a guitar)

443
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,565
-Poor guy... he lost his leg.
-No, no. No...

444
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,452
The fans will whoop it up
with that leg tonight...

445
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,199
You know, drink beer out of it and so on.

446
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,701
But, uh, it'll turn up in the morning

447
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,202
And I'll sew it back on.

448
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,794
Will that really work?

449
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,448
Well, I assume so...

450
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,077
{\an8}As long as I have Bart's healing powers.

451
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,874
{\an8}Why won't anybody listen to me?

452
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,088
I don't have any special powers.

453
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,958
I am not a healer.

454
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,375
Fine. More money for me.

455
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,465
(theme music playing)

456
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,465
Shh!
