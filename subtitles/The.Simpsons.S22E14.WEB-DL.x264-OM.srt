1
00:00:08,561 --> 00:00:09,327
D'oh!

2
00:01:19,898 --> 00:01:20,764
Gah!

3
00:02:02,837 --> 00:02:04,438
So the family's still gone.

4
00:02:04,505 --> 00:02:06,573
What do I do now?

5
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,911
Let's get this party started.

6
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,585
Bart's been alone
for 23 minutes.

7
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:22,488
Let's get this yo
on the road, people.

8
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:25,224
Wait, I haven't chosen
my mix-in.

9
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:28,027
Okay, I'll take some of that.

10
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:29,929
Well, that's my tip jar.

11
00:02:29,997 --> 00:02:32,264
Mix it in!

12
00:02:40,274 --> 00:02:42,543
Whoa, mama!

13
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,124
Let me freshen that up
for you.

14
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,600
I love Saturday!

15
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,907
I'm gonna kill you, boy.

16
00:03:16,414 --> 00:03:17,914
I'm bored.

17
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:19,248
That's it, boy!

18
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:21,017
I'm eating
your yogurt!

19
00:03:21,085 --> 00:03:22,886
You ate his yogurt
in the car.

20
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,220
He didn't know that.

21
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:26,823
Stupid kid.

22
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:28,525
All you do is cost me money.

23
00:03:28,593 --> 00:03:29,927
Money I could be wasting.

24
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:33,930
Is Bart Simpson here?

25
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:35,631
Because I'm about
to make him

26
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:36,732
and his family
very wealthy.

27
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,400
Wealthy?!

28
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,102
Hey, remember the guy

29
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:42,304
who drove you
to school that one time.

30
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,573
I should
introduce myself.

31
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:48,743
My name is Herman Milwood,
and my company makes...

32
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,345
The Aero Chair.

33
00:03:50,412 --> 00:03:53,181
The most comfortable
ergonomic chair there is.

34
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:55,217
So, what brings you
here, Mr. Chair?

35
00:03:55,285 --> 00:03:56,552
Bart, do you
remember this?

36
00:04:03,194 --> 00:04:04,728
That's <i>Angry Dad,</i>

37
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:07,197
the semi-autobiographical
Web cartoon I created.

38
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:09,399
I legally forced
him to say semi.

39
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:11,501
The multimillion dollar
Internet startup

40
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:15,371
that put <i>Angry Dad</i> on the net
ordered a lot of my chairs.

41
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,873
♪ <i>Bye, bye, bye...</i> ♪
♪ <i>Bye, bye</i> ♪

42
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,008
<i>But when</i>
<i>the tech bubble popped...</i>

43
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,147
...the chairs were never
paid for,

44
00:04:27,215 --> 00:04:28,816
so we repossessed the only thing

45
00:04:28,884 --> 00:04:30,017
they had left-- the cartoons.

46
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,561
And most importantly,
<i>Angry Dad,</i>

47
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:42,365
because now I want to make it
into a movie.

48
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:44,301
My stupid cartoon a movie?!

49
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:45,936
Thank you!

50
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:47,571
Oh, don't thank me.

51
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,974
Thank Hollywood for being
completely out of good ideas.

52
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,076
My little
Roman Polanski.

53
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:53,844
Homer!
What?

54
00:04:53,912 --> 00:04:55,912
What's wrong
with being Roman Polanski?

55
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,381
He what?

56
00:04:57,449 --> 00:04:58,849
You monster!

57
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,011
Thanks for letting me
make this movie, Mr. Milwood.

58
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,713
I've always loved cartoons,

59
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,948
going way back
to the real early <i>SpongeBobs.</i>

60
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:15,118
Well, I think your movie
has real potential.

61
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:17,787
Everyone has an angry dad,
even me.

62
00:05:17,855 --> 00:05:20,056
What the hell
are you making chairs for?

63
00:05:20,123 --> 00:05:23,559
In this family,
we sit on the ground!

64
00:05:23,627 --> 00:05:25,861
Now, Bart,

65
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:28,796
this is where we will help you
bring your vision to life.

66
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:32,299
Oh, my God, that's Bart Simpson!

67
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:33,567
And Angry
Dad himself.

68
00:05:33,635 --> 00:05:35,001
It's like meeting Mickey Mouse

69
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:36,770
and Walt Disney
at the same time.

70
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:42,042
Mr. Simpson, I'm in charge of
the team that animates your ass.

71
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:46,079
Anything you can give us
from real life?

72
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:47,681
Observe.

73
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:54,689
Wow. Whoa!

74
00:05:57,928 --> 00:05:59,328
Uh!

75
00:05:59,396 --> 00:06:01,496
Soda?
No, thanks.

76
00:06:01,564 --> 00:06:03,264
Eh. More for me.

77
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:07,869
Bart, we've got
some bad news.

78
00:06:07,937 --> 00:06:09,471
The actor who did
the original voice

79
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:11,439
of Angry Dad can't do the movie.

80
00:06:11,507 --> 00:06:13,041
He blew out his voice
screaming...

81
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:14,342
about how he never got paid.

82
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,877
The first time around.

83
00:06:15,944 --> 00:06:18,213
Oh, man.
What can we do?

84
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,848
Well, the cartoon's
based on your dad.

85
00:06:20,915 --> 00:06:22,449
Maybe he can do the voice.

86
00:06:22,517 --> 00:06:24,651
Can he get angry on cue?

87
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,893
Oh!

88
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,899
Hey, Homer, you want
to be the voice of Angry Dad?

89
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:44,136
It would be an honor!

90
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,506
Thanks for coming out.
One announcement.

91
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,310
The voice Angry Dad will be
on a speaker phone today.

92
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,412
There's something going
on at the nuclear plant

93
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,147
that's a little
more important

94
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,048
than your table read.

95
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,317
<i>Angry Dad: The Movie.</i>

96
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:02,654
"Angry Dad addresses the family
from the top of the stairs."

97
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:07,760
Family, today I graduate from
my anger-management class.

98
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:10,663
"Angry Dad slips and
crashes down the stairs."

99
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:12,165
"Pained noises."

100
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:14,668
No, Dad, don't say
"pained noises."

101
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:16,403
You make pained noises.

102
00:07:16,471 --> 00:07:17,737
Oh, okay.

103
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,506
Lenny, hit me with that chair.

104
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:20,741
Okay.

105
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,747
Hi, everyone.
I'm Bart Simpson,

106
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,748
the creator of <i>Angry Dad.</i>

107
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:33,151
To make this film, I had to miss
countless hours of school.

108
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,953
And there was also
some hardship.

109
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,855
I hope you like it
as much as I do.

110
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,526
<i>...The Movie!</i>

111
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,999
What did they think?
Well, let's not jump to conclusions.

112
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,768
We'll look at the tape of the
audience watching the movie.

113
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,942
Now comes the part where
the movie actually starts.

114
00:07:57,612 --> 00:08:02,182
For God's sake, turn it off!
Turn it off!

115
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,383
Oh.

116
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:05,185
Don't feel bad, boy.

117
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:07,120
Everyone makes mistakes.

118
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:09,055
Yours is just public
and expensive.

119
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:11,724
You know, your movie's
not all bad.

120
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,626
If you cut out the stuff
that didn't work,

121
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,694
it would make a great
short film.

122
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:16,795
A short film?!

123
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,263
Many great directors

124
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,532
like Wes Anderson,
Frank Tashlin

125
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,700
and Tim Burton started
with short films.

126
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,836
Name one more.
Taylor Hackford.

127
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,905
Well, I don't know
who that is,

128
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,674
but I'm convinced.
Let's start cutting.

129
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:38,097
<i>Bongiorno.</i>

130
00:08:38,165 --> 00:08:39,965
Where is the Bart-a-Simpson?

131
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:41,867
- I am the Bart.
- <i>Bravissimo.</i>

132
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:44,502
You know me as Luigi,
the spaghetti guy.

133
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,637
But I am here in my capacity

134
00:08:46,705 --> 00:08:49,940
as a member of the
Hollywood Foreign Press.

135
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:53,310
Your animated short,
<i>Angry Dad,</i>

136
00:08:53,378 --> 00:08:57,581
or as we call it in the pizza
English-- <i>Papa Apoplectica,</i>

137
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:59,183
she has-a been
a-nominated

138
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:00,852
for a Golden Globe.

139
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:03,888
Now if you'll excuse me,

140
00:09:03,956 --> 00:09:06,457
I have some unhappy news
to deliver

141
00:09:06,524 --> 00:09:08,125
to Sir Anthony Hopkins.

142
00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:09,660
Sir Anthony, your pizza--

143
00:09:09,728 --> 00:09:11,629
She's a-gonna
be late.

144
00:09:11,696 --> 00:09:13,897
Damn you.
Damn you to hell!

145
00:09:24,074 --> 00:09:25,307
Huh? What?

146
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,714
The creative team
from Mixar!

147
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,284
Pardon me. I have seen
all of your movies--

148
00:09:36,351 --> 00:09:38,819
except <i>Cars--</i> and I can't
believe my brother

149
00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:40,254
is in the same category

150
00:09:40,322 --> 00:09:42,456
as the digital Rembrandts
of my generation.

151
00:09:42,524 --> 00:09:45,660
So that makes your brother
the competition.

152
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,128
Randy, tell her how
we feel about that.

153
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:54,602

159

Hi. Yeah, it's me,
Ricky Gervais.

160
00:10:25,851 --> 00:10:28,652
Tanqueray gin and
tonic, please.

161
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,422
I'm paid to drink
that in my movies.

162
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,023
The amount isn't important.

163
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,858
A lot to you--
let's be honest.

164
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,061
Not so much to me.

165
00:10:37,128 --> 00:10:38,429
Aw.

166
00:10:38,497 --> 00:10:39,964
Okay, you missed it.

167
00:10:40,032 --> 00:10:41,699
But I just put
a tip in there.

168
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,635
A big one.
Double digits, ten.

169
00:10:43,703 --> 00:10:46,872
The lowest of the double digits,
but nevertheless, ten dollars.

170
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,773
So a lot of money to you.

171
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:50,275
Less to me.

172
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:51,243
But ten dollars
nonetheless.

173
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,510
Look at it.

174
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:54,212
The ten? That was
there before.

175
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,913
It was not!

176
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:57,982
Who else in here is going
to tip ten dollars?!

177
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:00,017
Keith Urban? Helen Mirren?
I don't think so.

178
00:11:00,085 --> 00:11:02,520
They don't have the common
touch, do they? Like me.

179
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:03,821
You've seen that.
We've bonded.

180
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:05,356
You're thinking,
"Wow, he's rich.

181
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:07,525
He's famous.
He's got great abs."

182
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:09,026
Personal trainer. You
couldn't afford that.

183
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:11,261
I used to be fat.
I used to eat junk food.

184
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:12,763
You probably still do.

185
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:14,031
But you're going,
"Wow, look at him.

186
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:15,332
How much did that
suit cost him?"

187
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,900
Nothing.
I got it for free.

188
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,402
That's what happens
when you're a celebrity.

189
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,371
Helen. Helen.

190
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:22,506
She can't hear me.
Helen! Mirren!

191
00:11:22,574 --> 00:11:24,242
Who does she
think she is?

192
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,077
Fur coat, no knickers.

193
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:29,448
Anyway, mate, your
ice is dripping.

194
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:32,184
And now, to
present the Golden Globe

195
00:11:32,252 --> 00:11:35,354
for best animated short,
Russell Brand.

196
00:11:35,422 --> 00:11:37,256
It's great to be here
with all the old friends

197
00:11:37,324 --> 00:11:38,524
I haven't seen since rehab.

198
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:39,793
No, no, I'm just kidding.

199
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,993
None of you are my friends.

200
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:45,164
And now, the nominees
for best animated short.

201
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:46,933
<i>The Brothers of Beauville.</i>

202
00:12:17,898 --> 00:12:19,399
<i>Saakashvili Spring.</i>

203
00:13:03,577 --> 00:13:04,744
<i>Condiments</i> by Mixar.

204
00:13:10,251 --> 00:13:11,484
And <i>Angry Dad.</i>

205
00:13:12,553 --> 00:13:14,989
And the Globe goes to...

206
00:13:15,056 --> 00:13:16,357
<i>Angry Dad!</i>

207
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:27,703
I have many people to thank.

208
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,972
Angry Dad's voice is
part Walter Matthau--

209
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,541
Hey, Felix--

210
00:13:31,608 --> 00:13:33,776
part Little Richard-- Whoo!

211
00:13:33,844 --> 00:13:36,378
and a little bit of Snoopy
when he cries:

212
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:42,817
This is insane!
He didn't show up for work,

213
00:13:42,884 --> 00:13:44,885
he badmouthed the movie on
<i>Jimmy Fallon,</i>

214
00:13:44,953 --> 00:13:46,786
and now he's hogging
all the credit!

215
00:13:46,854 --> 00:13:48,221
Don't worry, sweetie.

216
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:51,357
This is just the first
of way too many award shows.

217
00:13:51,425 --> 00:13:54,126
You'll get your chance
to say ridiculous things.

218
00:13:54,194 --> 00:13:56,261
I'd like to thank
Mr. Speedy Pants Repair

219
00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:59,164
for sewing up my pants
just before the ceremony

220
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:01,567
and the woman
who has inspired me every day

221
00:14:01,635 --> 00:14:05,470
for the past 25 years,
the cute one from The Bangles!

222
00:14:05,538 --> 00:14:07,873
See you at the cool party!

223
00:14:32,932 --> 00:14:35,299
Hello. I'm wearing
my retainer.

224
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:37,635
<i>Angry Dad</i> got
an Oscar nomination?!

225
00:14:37,703 --> 00:14:40,938
♪ I'm going to the Oscars
not as a seat-filler ♪

226
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:44,241
♪ I'll get a gift basket,
but I won't declare it ♪

227
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:47,278
Hey, don't you know
it's awards season?

228
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:49,981
Who's calling you at 5:00
in the morning, anyway?

229
00:14:50,048 --> 00:14:51,983
Ah, nobody.
Wrong number.

230
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,386
If I find out it's a right
number, you're in big trouble!

231
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:04,186
It's Bart Simpson,

232
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:05,565
writer-director
of <i>Angry Dad!</i>

233
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:06,866
And you are with?

234
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:08,701
My lame-o sister Lisa.

235
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:10,736
And Lisa,
who are you wearing?

236
00:15:10,804 --> 00:15:12,805
I believe it's from Lamps Plus.

237
00:15:12,873 --> 00:15:15,208
And where's
the Angry Dad himself?

238
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:16,877
Where's Homer Simpson?

239
00:15:16,945 --> 00:15:18,612
Homer? I don't know.

240
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,249
L.A.'s a world-class city
with a lot to offer.

241
00:15:21,316 --> 00:15:23,184
He's probably enjoying
the sights.

242
00:15:30,393 --> 00:15:31,527
Uh-oh.

243
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:34,663
Yo-yo-yo! Why you messing

244
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:37,066
with Simon Rodeo's
folk-art masterpiece?!

245
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:38,801
Check it out!
That's Angry Dad!

246
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:40,903
Hey, why ain't you
at the Oscars, A.D.?

247
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:42,739
Oscars? What are you
talking about?

248
00:15:42,806 --> 00:15:45,775
My son gave me this list
of awesome things to do in L.A.

249
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:48,645
"Chatsworth"?

250
00:15:48,713 --> 00:15:50,580
That's where the 118 meets
Topanga Canyon, fool!

251
00:15:50,647 --> 00:15:53,550
Someone must not want you
at that kudo-cast, yo.

252
00:15:53,617 --> 00:15:56,720
Damn, Home Simp,
you been Oscar-blocked!

253
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,622
What you think
about that, Nasty J?

254
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,191
That's cold.

255
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:03,761
Hmm, who could
possibly want

256
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,663
to stop me from
accepting an award?

257
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,498
My category comes up
pretty soon.

258
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,334
I home free
as long as this Oscar show

259
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,035
is tight and fast-paced.

260
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,370
Sound mixers may
not be glamorous,

261
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:15,473
but they make us
sound so good.

262
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,708
Without them,
we'd be up a creek

263
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:20,210
without a decibel.

264
00:16:22,113 --> 00:16:25,714
♪ California... ♪

265
00:16:25,782 --> 00:16:27,382
No worries, A.D.,
we got time.

266
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,784
We'll get you over
to your venue

267
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:30,552
and pick up some dim sum
on the way.

268
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,055
According to this live blog,
Ben Stiller and Jack Black

269
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:34,690
are doing a bit
that will not end.

270
00:16:40,096 --> 00:16:42,998
Turn it off, turn it off!
For God's sake, turn it off!

271
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:47,704
And now please welcome Academy
Award winner Halle Berry.

272
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:51,976
When most people think
of animated movies,

273
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:54,444
they think of 40 minutes
or more,

274
00:16:54,512 --> 00:16:56,814
but there is another type
of animated film:

275
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,650
40 minutes or less.

276
00:16:59,717 --> 00:17:02,219
Conductor, get ready
to play my song.

277
00:17:02,286 --> 00:17:05,755
And the winner is...
not going to be announced

278
00:17:05,823 --> 00:17:07,590
until we watch a lengthy clip
from each short.

279
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:10,426
<i>Condiments</i> by Mixar.

280
00:17:14,064 --> 00:17:16,499
The Tabasco brothers
got Frenchy!

281
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:19,169
We're gonna have to leave
the kitchen.

282
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:24,008
I don't want to go!
I don't want to go!

283
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,177
Wake me for the syrupy ending.

284
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:29,081
Timmy's coming!
Assume your positions!

285
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,722
My God, I'm empty!

286
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,058
Don't let 'em put pencils in me!

287
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,665
Thanks, Rollin' 80s.

288
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,234
Hey, you two are honorary
members for life.

289
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,736
That means any other gang
sees you, they'll kill you.

290
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:54,705
I was born a Rollin' 80

291
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,840
and I'll die
a Rollin' 80!

292
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:59,608
Willis and Crumble in
<i>Better Gnomes and Gardens.</i>

293
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:02,144
Not to worry,
Miss Penny Farthing,

294
00:18:02,212 --> 00:18:03,646
Crumble will soon have

295
00:18:03,713 --> 00:18:06,581
your garden gnomes back in
tip-top condition.

296
00:18:21,965 --> 00:18:24,534
He's good as new!

297
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:26,569
You must come in
for a spot of tea

298
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:29,272
and a homemade
Marmite sandwich.

299
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,673
Homemade Marmite?!

300
00:18:30,741 --> 00:18:34,510
And made by a woman
with such gentle hands.

301
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:07,043
Crumble! Crumble!

302
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,312
Where has that
silly dog got to?

303
00:19:10,715 --> 00:19:12,215
Oh, my!

304
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:15,018
Good luck, Mr. Park.

305
00:19:15,085 --> 00:19:17,420
There will be no shame
in losing to you.

306
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:18,889
Oh, that's very
sweet of you.

307
00:19:18,956 --> 00:19:20,257
Thank you
for saying so.

308
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,926
No worries.

309
00:19:22,993 --> 00:19:24,327
I'll just stick 'em
back on.

310
00:19:24,395 --> 00:19:25,695
I'm more clay
than man now.

311
00:19:25,763 --> 00:19:27,797
And finally, <i>Angry Dad.</i>

312
00:19:31,435 --> 00:19:33,202
No free refills!

313
00:19:46,115 --> 00:19:49,284
Ah! Damn, that's good!

314
00:19:49,352 --> 00:19:53,121
And for best animated short,
the Oscar goes to...

315
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:54,989
Wait, one last moment
about me.

316
00:19:55,057 --> 00:19:57,591
Every night, I dream that
my teeth fly out of my mouth.

317
00:19:57,659 --> 00:19:59,493
<i>Angry Dad.</i>

318
00:19:59,561 --> 00:20:00,894
Yes!

319
00:20:08,002 --> 00:20:12,305
This is it! I finally get to
accept an award for <i>my</i> movie.

320
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,776
Except it's not just my movie.

321
00:20:16,844 --> 00:20:19,412
It was my sister's idea
to make this into a short.

322
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,981
And so many animators.

323
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:22,817
Every day was
somebody's birthday.

324
00:20:22,884 --> 00:20:25,687
And you know what?
It was my dad's movie, too.

325
00:20:25,754 --> 00:20:28,923
I only wish he were here,
and not at Cerritos Auto Square.

326
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:31,760
You got your wish, boy.
I'm proud of you.

327
00:20:31,828 --> 00:20:33,361
I'm sorry I took
all the credit.

328
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:35,030
This whole thing
is silly.

329
00:20:35,098 --> 00:20:37,732
I mean, isn't the idea
of one person taking credit

330
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,036
for an entire movie the
stupidest thing you ever heard?

331
00:20:41,103 --> 00:20:43,771
You make a lot of good points,
Bart, a lot of good points.

332
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:45,573
You're a very thoughtful kid.

333
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,374
You remind me of Deborah Kerr
in <i>Black Narcissus.</i>

334
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:49,076
Anyway, granted, despite what
André Bazin might say,

335
00:20:49,143 --> 00:20:50,810
films are a collaborative
art form.

336
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:53,112
But hey, you can't give
an Oscar to everyone.

337
00:21:00,321 --> 00:21:01,522
We can still order
a replacement

338
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:03,157
from the Academy,
right?

339
00:21:03,224 --> 00:21:05,960
Hey, they're, like,
five bucks on eBay.

340
00:21:06,328 --> 00:21:08,629
Oh, hi. Ricky Gervais.

341
00:21:08,697 --> 00:21:11,599
Um, such an honor
to meet you, Sir Ridley.

342
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,735
I love your movies.

343
00:21:13,802 --> 00:21:15,336
Or as I call them, "films."

344
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:17,872
Um, glad I bumped
into you, actually,

345
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,709
because I'm looking
to expand beyond comedy.

346
00:21:30,717 --> 00:21:32,785
I know what you're
thinking, Sir Ridley.

347
00:21:32,853 --> 00:21:35,287
You're thinking,
"Oh, my word!

348
00:21:35,355 --> 00:21:38,324
"He's been making me laugh
all these years,

349
00:21:38,392 --> 00:21:42,462
"but now he's
moving me as well!

350
