1
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:51,922
Ooh!

2
00:01:03,635 --> 00:01:05,202
D'oh!

3
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:37,134
Dodgeball!

4
00:01:37,202 --> 00:01:39,603
Yay, Dodgeball!

5
00:01:41,373 --> 00:01:44,708
We're down to our
final four huckers!

6
00:01:44,776 --> 00:01:47,111
Three wily fourth graders

7
00:01:47,178 --> 00:01:49,246
and one scrappy
fifth gradesman!

8
00:01:49,314 --> 00:01:50,648
To the death!

9
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,223
Ha...

10
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,458
ah... ah...

11
00:02:34,526 --> 00:02:36,160
Where do you want
your ball mark,

12
00:02:36,227 --> 00:02:37,361
face or belly?

13
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:39,863
How about...
in your dreams!

14
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:40,764
Hee-yah!

15
00:02:56,081 --> 00:02:58,782
I'm not the coach!
There <i>is</i> no coach!

16
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,351
I just wanted to see
if you were wearing a bra.

17
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:02,619
Oh.

18
00:03:05,523 --> 00:03:07,424
Your four eyes saw
a lot today, Milhouse.

19
00:03:07,492 --> 00:03:08,642
What's the skinny?

20
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,527
The fifth graders
played a great game.

21
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:12,246
They got a great
program up there.

22
00:03:12,313 --> 00:03:13,447
Great fans!

23
00:03:13,531 --> 00:03:15,449
But this was
just our day.

24
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:17,801
Whatever happens, they
can never take away...

25
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:19,736
Aah! The ball never
touched the ground--

26
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:21,105
and I caught it!

27
00:03:21,172 --> 00:03:23,323
That means fifth
graders win!

28
00:03:23,391 --> 00:03:24,575
No way!

29
00:03:24,642 --> 00:03:25,743
What a rip!

30
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,478
Shut your gobs!

31
00:03:27,545 --> 00:03:29,246
I only took this
refereeing job

32
00:03:29,314 --> 00:03:31,148
'cause I was cold
and needed a shirt!

33
00:03:44,996 --> 00:03:46,797
I hate you fifth graders!

34
00:03:46,865 --> 00:03:48,832
I deem this
victory Pyrrhic!

35
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,968
Pyrrhic! Pyrrhic!

36
00:03:51,035 --> 00:03:53,103
Your response is puerile!

37
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:55,405
Puerile! Puerile!

38
00:03:55,473 --> 00:03:57,141

43
00:04:11,122 --> 00:04:14,057
How dare they dishonor
the lyrics of "Old Gray Mare"!

44
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,359
How dare they!

45
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,264
Zach! Zach!

46
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:22,366
Who did this to you?

47
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:24,601
It was... it was...

48
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:26,637
the fourth graders!

49
00:04:34,646 --> 00:04:37,414
I like to think my kids would
know how to lose gracefully.

50
00:04:37,482 --> 00:04:39,483
In the fifth grade,
we teach character.

51
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,984
Mike, let's be
adults here.

52
00:04:41,052 --> 00:04:42,553
You're right, Edna.

53
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,538
Fourth sucks.
Oh, that's it!

54
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:06,677
Why, I oughta...

55
00:05:06,744 --> 00:05:07,911
Hey, fourth graders,

56
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:10,047
can you help us
with our fractions?

57
00:05:10,114 --> 00:05:11,415
Oh, wait, you can't.

58
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:16,086
They ain't even read <i>Where</i>
<i>the Red Fern Grows</i> yet.

59
00:05:17,272 --> 00:05:18,822
That's it!

60
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,891
We challenge you
to a rumble.

61
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,060
Challenge accepted.

62
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:24,728
This is gonna be great!

63
00:05:24,796 --> 00:05:27,097
A real rumble,
just like in that movie

64
00:05:27,165 --> 00:05:29,566
where the Jets
fought the Sharks.

65
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:31,568
Hmm...

66
00:05:48,486 --> 00:05:52,389
Rumble it is!
After school, rain or shine.

67
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:55,993
Anybody want to wait
for shine?

68
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,727
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

69
00:05:56,794 --> 00:05:57,928
Definitely shine.

70
00:05:57,996 --> 00:06:01,064
It's agreed-- no biting,
no throwing rocks,

71
00:06:01,132 --> 00:06:03,166
no face farts,
flying face farts,

72
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:04,968
backdoor haircuts,
'nad noogies,

73
00:06:05,036 --> 00:06:08,372
moist Michaels, and absolutely
no "Brazilian hardwood."

74
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,974
Is this a rumble
or a harvest dance?

75
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:12,242
Okay, you want hardwood?

76
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,377
No, no, no, no.

77
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:15,579
Then let's do this thing.

78
00:06:18,016 --> 00:06:19,716
You know, if they
do this regularly,

79
00:06:19,784 --> 00:06:21,251
maybe it could
count as gym.

80
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,520
Did you wear those
same clothes yesterday?

81
00:06:23,588 --> 00:06:26,623
No. I have two identical sets
of these clothes.

82
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:29,559
I see. With a stain on the
shirt in the exact same place?

83
00:06:29,627 --> 00:06:31,628
Things aren't good at home.

84
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:38,035
Rumble!

85
00:06:38,102 --> 00:06:40,103
Why don't you
head on home, pal.

86
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:41,805
Bless you.

87
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:45,208
Huh?

88
00:06:45,276 --> 00:06:47,077
Where'd you
get that scar?

89
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:49,880
I had it as long as
I can remember. Why?

90
00:06:52,684 --> 00:06:54,818
You call
that a scar?!

91
00:06:54,886 --> 00:06:56,586
This is a scar!

92
00:06:56,654 --> 00:06:58,188
That's your
belly button.

93
00:06:58,256 --> 00:06:59,856
Everybody's got one.

94
00:06:59,924 --> 00:07:01,892
I thought
I was special.

95
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,733
When did this happen?

96
00:07:09,998 --> 00:07:12,313
You <i>sure</i> none of you
guys gave me this?

97
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:14,646
I'm going through
my bully logbook here,

98
00:07:14,714 --> 00:07:17,749
but I just don't see it.
Don't be afraid to use your glasses.

99
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:19,284
You shut up!
Ow!

100
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:22,554
"January 9, whaled on
Jimbo with this book.

101
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:24,556
Awaiting results."

102
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:27,893
"Unqualified success."

103
00:07:29,963 --> 00:07:32,865
Why do you have to eat peanuts
in the shower?

104
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:35,734
Can't start the day without that
fresh-from-the-circus feeling.

105
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:41,807
Mom, do you have any idea
how I got this scar?

106
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,877
I was afraid
this day would come.

107
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:47,012
Ew! You're sitting
on the toilet!

108
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,381
When it's closed,
it's a chair.

109
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:51,183
When you were little,
I used to take you

110
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:52,718
to a Mommy-and-Me toddler gym.

111
00:07:52,785 --> 00:07:55,554
You were friends with three
other boys, and I became close

112
00:07:55,622 --> 00:07:57,155
with their moms.

113
00:07:57,223 --> 00:07:59,758
<i>But they were</i>
<i>a bad influence on you.</i>

114
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:13,005
Ah... such an
innocent time.

115
00:08:13,072 --> 00:08:15,040
Before cooties
ravaged our community.

116
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:17,242
How come we don't
get together anymore?

117
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,612
The moms and I had a falling
out, which was a shame--

118
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,581
we had been such
good friends.

119
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:23,749
Whoa!

120
00:08:23,816 --> 00:08:25,250
You don't look like a mom,

121
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:26,518
you look happy.

122
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:28,987
We called ourselves
the "Cool Moms."

123
00:08:29,055 --> 00:08:33,158
There's nothing cooler
than calling yourself cool.

124
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:38,230
Maybe we <i>could</i>
get back together.

125
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:40,065
Awesome! I'll get
the white wine.

126
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:41,767
You can't buy white wine!

127
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:43,869
Why not? Are you
having red meat?

128
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:45,604
Oh! Are you through
with the chair?

129
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:47,673
I've got to do the taxes.
It's all yours.

130
00:08:49,976 --> 00:08:52,511
...number of dependents, three.

131
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:55,580
Um, add to line 13...

132
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:58,517
Hmm, better check
last year's return.

133
00:08:58,584 --> 00:08:59,518
Hm.

134
00:09:01,154 --> 00:09:02,554
Seven years.

135
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:04,056
A lot of memories.

136
00:09:04,123 --> 00:09:05,958
Talking, chatting.

137
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:07,960
Remember how
we used to reminisce?

138
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:09,494
Mm-hmm.

139
00:09:09,562 --> 00:09:12,564
You know who was really happy to
get back together? Our husbands!

140
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:16,735
Been a while since our
wives got together, huh?

141
00:09:16,803 --> 00:09:17,970
Mm. Whatever.

142
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:19,604
Why are we
getting together again?

143
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:21,640
I was so happy
when it stopped.

144
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,009
Let's just shut up and get
through this, all right?

145
00:09:26,512 --> 00:09:28,580
Homer, stop doing that.

146
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:31,316
Homer!

147
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:33,986
Ooh, I got a text!

148
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:35,187
I got a text.

149
00:09:35,254 --> 00:09:36,655
Are you gonna
open it?

150
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:38,890
No, that page isn't optimized
for cell phone use...

151
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,392
Why am I
talking to you?!

152
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,661
Because you're my best
friend in the room.

153
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:45,364
Wow! We all have
the same scar!

154
00:09:45,431 --> 00:09:47,065
So how'd you get yours?

155
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:48,767
My mom won't tell me.

156
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:50,802
My mom will tell me
how my dad is in bed,

157
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,070
but not about this.

158
00:09:52,138 --> 00:09:54,239
Ever do a cold drop
out of a tree house?

159
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:55,807
Only, like, every day.

160
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,642
More like
<i>all</i> day every day.

161
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:00,912
Cowabunga...!

162
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:06,985
Check out my gnarly
backwards foot!

163
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:15,994
I said, "For the price
of this coffee,

164
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:18,130
I should have just
flown to Brazil."

165
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:24,236
Anyone see a good
beer commercial lately?

166
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:26,671
Asinine. Everything
you say is asinine.

167
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:31,209
Those dudes
were intense.

168
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:33,011
I'm glad you had fun,

169
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:35,547
because we're all getting
together next week.

170
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:37,716
Great. Great.

171
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:40,519
Oh, and, Homie, can you come
home early from work tomorrow

172
00:10:40,586 --> 00:10:42,687
so I can have
a girls' night out?

173
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:45,824
Sure, I'll stay home and
Skype with the guys at Moe's.

174
00:10:45,892 --> 00:10:47,159
Hey, how you doing, Home...

175
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:52,097
Stupid Flanders' Wi-Fi.

176
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:54,199
Uh, that wasn't the Wi-Fi.

177
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:56,134
My Bell's palsy's acting up.

178
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:01,807
Yeah, it can be tough, but,
you know, I try to stay posit...

179
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:10,649
I've been dying
to try it.

180
00:11:10,716 --> 00:11:13,418
Marge, who are you cutting
up that chicken for?

181
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:15,053
The kids aren't here.

182
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:17,756
Huh? Oh. Myself, I guess.

183
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:20,125
Who's kicking?

184
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:21,827
No one. No one's kicking.

185
00:11:21,894 --> 00:11:25,330
Sorry. I'm just not used
to everyone behaving.

186
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:26,932
Oh, Marge.

187
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:28,567
If you don't have a life
outside your kids,

188
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:30,402
how do you expect to be happy?

189
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,671
I've got a great idea.
From now on,

190
00:11:32,738 --> 00:11:35,474
the four of us will get
together every Tuesday.

191
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,476
Go out on a Tuesday?

192
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:38,877
Who am I, Charlie Sheen?

193
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,514
Fine, I'll do it.

194
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:48,120
Oh...

195
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,293
Oh...

196
00:12:03,052 --> 00:12:04,236
Oh...

197
00:12:04,303 --> 00:12:06,805
"Ion." Hmm.

198
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:08,173
No.

199
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:10,041
"Irene Ryan is

200
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:11,843
TV's Granny."

201
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:14,479
Thanks for the ride!

202
00:12:14,547 --> 00:12:16,081
Hmm?

203
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:18,667
This is late for Marge.
I assume.

204
00:12:18,734 --> 00:12:20,035
I've never been home
at this hour.

205
00:12:21,637 --> 00:12:23,104
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh!

206
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:27,209
Hey, Marge.

207
00:12:27,276 --> 00:12:29,644
Partaking of the grape, were we?

208
00:12:29,712 --> 00:12:33,615
Just a little Merlot...

209
00:12:33,683 --> 00:12:36,117
Mmm... You want to stay
up and talk a while?

210
00:12:36,185 --> 00:12:38,487
Are you sleepy?
I'm not sleepy.

211
00:12:42,258 --> 00:12:44,192
And Anita's family
rented a beach house,

212
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,594
and guess what?

213
00:12:45,661 --> 00:12:47,662
They went to the
beach every day.

214
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,531
Oh, great.
That's great.

215
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:52,133
But I have to get
to work in the morning.

216
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:53,969
But I don't want
a beach house.

217
00:12:54,036 --> 00:12:56,004
Sand makes me sad

218
00:12:56,072 --> 00:12:57,672
because it used
to be big rocks.

219
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,491
But not anymore.

220
00:12:59,575 --> 00:13:01,993
Not anymore...

221
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:13,288
Kind of weird,
us all being naked in here.

222
00:13:13,356 --> 00:13:15,023
We're not naked.

223
00:13:15,091 --> 00:13:16,691
Right. Neither am I.

224
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:26,334
Listen, any of you guys
want to play Old Maid?

225
00:13:26,402 --> 00:13:28,837
Don't be a wuss.
We all did it.

226
00:13:28,905 --> 00:13:30,021
Chicken!

227
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:42,984
If I do it,
you're supposed to stop!

228
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:44,586
Don't tell a chicken
when to cluck.

229
00:13:44,654 --> 00:13:46,588
You're not the chicken,
I'm the chicken!

230
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:48,340
Chicken!

231
00:13:52,562 --> 00:13:54,829
Ooh, three!

232
00:13:54,897 --> 00:13:56,431
Bart?

233
00:13:56,499 --> 00:13:57,666
Hey.

234
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:00,936
They dared me to see
how many TV remotes

235
00:14:01,003 --> 00:14:02,504
I could stick
in my mouth.

236
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:05,307
We've got to stop Mom
from going out with those women.

237
00:14:05,374 --> 00:14:09,477
Something drove them apart
once before.

238
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:12,814
And I bet it has something
to do with this scar.

239
00:14:12,882 --> 00:14:15,684
I've seen
this mark before.

240
00:14:15,751 --> 00:14:17,285
On you,
every time you come in.

241
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:21,156
I believe it had something
to do with Comic Book Guy.

242
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:22,991
Comic Book Guy? Thanks.

243
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:24,392
Listen. Are you going
to see him now?

244
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,061
You can give him
some news for me.

245
00:14:26,128 --> 00:14:28,196
Tell him it's
the worst prognosis ever.

246
00:14:32,868 --> 00:14:35,270
Oh! I knew
this day would come.

247
00:14:35,338 --> 00:14:38,139
Although frankly, I thought it
would have been a long time ago.

248
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:40,742
You are very uncurious
about your body.

249
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,945
All right, Comic Book Guy.
Tell me my origin story.

250
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:45,880
I will not relive
the horror of that day!

251
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:47,182
The answer is "no,"

252
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:49,351
and I can say it
in Na'vi or Klingon,

253
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:50,752
which are pretty
much the same.

254
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,120
I have some theories on that

255
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:54,122
which I will share
with you never.

256
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,857
You leave me no choice.

257
00:14:55,925 --> 00:14:58,627
I hold in my hands
a mint-condition copy

258
00:14:58,694 --> 00:15:02,063
of the legendary
<i>Interesting Stories</i> Number 27.

259
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:05,300
Oh! Oh, the first appearance
of Radioactive Man.

260
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:07,869
And if you don't tell us
what we want to know...

261
00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:15,410
How do I know that is not
a cheap reprint?

262
00:15:15,478 --> 00:15:17,178
Are you willing
to take that chance?

263
00:15:17,246 --> 00:15:18,813
Yes.

264
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:23,752
No! No! No!

265
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:25,353
I'll tell you
what you want to know.

266
00:15:25,421 --> 00:15:27,055
Could we hurry
this up?

267
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:29,891
I am really uncomfortable
being a girl in this store.

268
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:31,493
Very well.
I shall tell you

269
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,429
what happened to you and your
friends several years ago.

270
00:15:34,497 --> 00:15:37,065
But for you to understand it,
I must go back a little further.

271
00:15:40,002 --> 00:15:43,071
Our story begins with the
creation of Middle Earth,

272
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,940
as recounted in the Ainulindal
and the Valaquenta.

273
00:15:46,008 --> 00:15:48,777
Behold Melkor,
proudest of the Ainu!

274
00:15:48,844 --> 00:15:50,578
Look, pal,
we've gotta speed this up.

275
00:15:52,548 --> 00:15:55,750
Fine. Children just want to know
what is and not why it is.

276
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,298
Your scar, like Tom Cruise's
last good movie,

277
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:08,926
was born on
the Fourth of July.

278
00:16:08,994 --> 00:16:10,861
<i>It was seven years ago,</i>

279
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,164
<i>a time when "twilight" meant</i>
<i>the end of the day</i>

280
00:16:13,231 --> 00:16:16,150
<i>and not the most barftastic</i>
<i>horror franchise of all time.</i>

281
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:29,096
<i>Earth's single sun was setting,</i>
<i>and the Mayor began to speak...</i>

282
00:16:29,164 --> 00:16:32,533
Even though most of this town
collaborated with the British,

283
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:36,303
and we are still in informal
talks to return to their empire,

284
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,539
we all love fireworks!

285
00:16:38,607 --> 00:16:40,341
Yay!

286
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:42,643
<i>Traditionally,</i>
<i>the Fourth of July fireworks</i>

287
00:16:42,694 --> 00:16:44,445
<i>were operated by the person</i>
<i>most likely</i>

288
00:16:44,513 --> 00:16:46,347
<i>to be sober and dateless.</i>

289
00:16:46,415 --> 00:16:48,682
<i>Once again,</i>
<i>the honor fell to me.</i>

290
00:16:53,355 --> 00:16:55,589
This is your TV
for the year, kids.

291
00:16:55,657 --> 00:16:57,858
And the embers is your dinner.

292
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:09,070
<i>While I was busy tending to</i>

293
00:17:09,137 --> 00:17:12,540
<i>a critical matter</i>
<i>of great delicacy,</i>

294
00:17:12,607 --> 00:17:15,543
<i>you and your diaper-wearing</i>
<i>droogs ruined everything!</i>

295
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:41,969
And that is when
the four of you

296
00:17:42,037 --> 00:17:43,971
each received
the mark of the sword.

297
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,706
Hmm.

298
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:49,910
Every Fourth of July
I remember that fallen hero.

299
00:17:49,978 --> 00:17:51,579
God, how I miss you.

300
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:56,784
So, what's the plan again?

301
00:17:56,852 --> 00:17:59,753
I go to see those other guys,
we blow this junk up,

302
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:03,057
once again Mom decides that
they're a bad influence on me,

303
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,326
and she stops seeing those
women who make her so happy.

304
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,095
What are you boys doing?

305
00:18:08,163 --> 00:18:11,265
Uh, we're doing
a project on...

306
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,634
uh, uh, uh...
the subject of...

307
00:18:13,702 --> 00:18:15,769
something pertaining to...

308
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:17,204
here it comes...

309
00:18:17,272 --> 00:18:19,240
Milhouse, I'm getting
tired of waiting.

310
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,142
Can I go home and
think of a lie?

311
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:22,743
Yes, you may.

312
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,478
Mom...

313
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:27,982
I'll admit it: I wanted to
create a devastating explosion

314
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:29,650
to get back my mom.

315
00:18:29,718 --> 00:18:32,703
Aw, Bart, sweetie...

316
00:18:32,771 --> 00:18:35,089
I love you kids
with all my heart,

317
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,658
but damn it,
I need something for myself!

318
00:18:37,726 --> 00:18:39,426
I made you a coffee mug
on Mother's Day!

319
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:40,828
Isn't that enough?

320
00:18:40,896 --> 00:18:42,596
It's close, but no.

321
00:18:46,434 --> 00:18:49,970
I could light these,
but it wouldn't be the same.

322
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,178
Well, I've put it off

323
00:18:57,245 --> 00:18:59,980
but today I'm finally getting
this garage organized.

324
00:19:01,616 --> 00:19:03,617
Guess I'll put these tools away.

325
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,219
Hang 'em on hooks and such.

326
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:09,223
So Bart,
the little dickens,

327
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,126
was gonna set off an explosion
to break us up.

328
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:14,528
Can you believe it?

329
00:19:14,596 --> 00:19:16,797
Actually, we
can believe it.

330
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,332
What are you talking about?

331
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,868
Your son always was the
bad apple of the bunch.

332
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:23,837
You know nothing about my son

333
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:25,806
and even less about apples.

334
00:19:32,681 --> 00:19:35,783
I remember why I left this group
seven years ago,

335
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,652
and it's why I'm leaving now.

336
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,787
Good day, ladies.

337
00:19:41,856 --> 00:19:43,991
Well, since she's gone...

338
00:19:45,694 --> 00:19:47,394
Come here, you.

339
00:19:50,198 --> 00:19:52,433
Sorry you broke up
with your friends, Mom.

340
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,436
Oh, I think they were
never my friends.

341
00:19:55,503 --> 00:19:58,105
Maybe true friends
aren't random people

342
00:19:58,173 --> 00:20:00,441
you meet at a
Mommy-and-Me class.

343
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:03,110
They're random people
you meet in a college dorm.

344
00:20:03,178 --> 00:20:05,179
Maybe Lisa and I
can be friends.

345
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,814
Not with each other,
but with you.

346
00:20:06,881 --> 00:20:08,082
Oh...

347
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:09,984
Ow!
Ah!

348
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:11,385
Grr.

349
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:14,455
Hey, does Dad know you
and the cool moms broke up?

350
00:20:14,522 --> 00:20:17,224
Well, Homer got along so well
with the other dads,

351
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:18,592
I couldn't break it to him.

352
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:25,099
Oh. Can we at least
drink beer or something?

353
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,001
Why do you keep
