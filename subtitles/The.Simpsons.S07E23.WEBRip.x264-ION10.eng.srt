One count
of being a bear.

And one count

47
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,076
of being an accessory
to being a bear.

We were trapped
in the house all afternoon

52
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,053
and... well...

53
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,005
we had to drink
toilet water.

54
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,216
Well, things were
bad everywhere.

55
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,387
I'm sick of these
constant bear attacks!

56
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,395
It's like a freakin' country
bear jamboroo around here.

57
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,518
Well, now,
realistically, Homer,

58
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,356
I've lived here
some 30-odd years.

59
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,611
This is the first
and only bear I've ever seen.

60
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,033
Hey,

61
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,661
if you want wild bears
eating your children

62
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,949
and scaring away
your salmon,

63
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,412
that's your business.

64
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,781
But I'm not gonna take it!

65
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,488
Who's with me?

66
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,998
ALL: I am!

67
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,333

We're here! We're queer!

68

ALL:
We're here! We're queer!

70
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,713
We don't want any more bears!

71
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,127
Hey Homer,
that's a pretty catchy chant.

72
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,176
Where'd you learn it?

73
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,678
Oh, I heard it

74
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,890
at the mustache parade
they have every year.

75
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,390
ALL: We don't want
any more bears!

76
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,682
Sir, there's an unruly
mob to see you.

77
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,096
Does it have
an appointment?

78
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,854
Uh... yes it does.

79
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,686
I phoned ahead.

80
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,021
Mr. Mayor, I hate
to break it to you

81
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,526
but your city
is infested with bears.

82
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,399
And these ones are smarter
than the average bear.

83
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,357
They swiped my
pic-a-nic basket.

84
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,697
Think of the children.

85
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,282
Very well.

86
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,157
I promise swift
and decisive action

87
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,334
against these
hibernating hucksters.

88
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,332

89
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,578

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,759
(siren wailing)

91
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,802
Ahh, not a bear in sight.

92
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:25,426
The bear patrol must
be working like a charm.

93
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,095
{\an8}That's specious
reasoning, Dad.

94
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,353
Thank you, honey.

95
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,984
{\an8}By your logic,
I could claim

96
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,811
{\an8}that this rock
keeps tigers away.

97
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:32,806
Oh, how does it work?

98
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,437
{\an8}It doesn't work.

99
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,194
-Uh-huh.
-It's just a stupid rock.

100
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,276
-Uh-huh.
-But I don't see

101
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,661
any tigers around here.
Do you?

102
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:44,028
Lisa, I
want to buy your rock.

103
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:51,958
Woo-hoo!

104
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,671
A perfect day--
Zero bears

105
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:57,091
and one
big fat hairy paycheck!

106
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,421
Hey!
How come my pay is so low?

107
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,927
"Bear Patrol Tax: $5..."

108
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,550
What?!
This is an outrage!

109
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,347
It's the biggest tax increase
in history!

110
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,182
{\an8}Actually, Dad, it's the smallest
tax increase in history.

111
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,598
Let the bears
pay the Bear Tax!

112
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,016
I pay the Homer tax!

113
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,524
That's the Home-owner Tax.

114
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,265
Well, anyway,
I'm still outraged.

115
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,701
ALL:
Down with taxes!

116
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,370
Down with taxes!
Down with taxes!

117
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,540
Won't you think
of the children?

118
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,409
Are these morons
getting dumber or just louder?

119
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,287
Dumber, sir.

120
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,254
They won't give up
the bear patrol

121
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,665
but they won't pay taxes
for it either.

122
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,963
Ducking this issue
calls for real leadership.

123
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:45,848
People, your taxes are high
because of illegal immigrants!

124
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,928
That's right--
illegal immigrants!

125
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,515
We need to get rid of them!

126
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,520
(overlapping chatter)

127
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,562
Immiggants!
I knew it was them!

128
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,725
Even when it
was the bears

129
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,403
I knew it was them!

130
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:01,492
Oh, won't somebody
please think of the children?

131
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,319
In one week, the town will vote
on a special referendum--

132
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,735
whether or not to deport

133
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,123
all illegal immigrants
from Springfield.

134
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,621
It shall be known
as Proposition 24.

135
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,043
(cheering)

136
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,585
Hey, German boy,

137
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,671
go back to Germania!

138
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,588
I do not deserve this.

139
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:28,716
I have come here legally
as an exchange student.

140
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,925
Young man, the only thing
we exchanged for you

141
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,675
was our national dignity.

142
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,397
(laughter)

143
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,308
You want to
pick on immigrants?!

144
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,937
-Then pick on Willie!
-Willie, please.

145
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:43,244
The children want to pick on
someone their own size.

146
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,319
Ach...

147
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,784
(eating loudly)

148
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:53,367
I don't see how you can support
Proposition 24, Dad.

149
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,874
Open your eyes, Lisa.

150
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,536
Our schools are so
jam-packed with immigrants,

151
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,995
kids like Bart have
lost the will to learn.

152
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,496
There's no
denying it, sis.

153
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,047
But immigration is
what America is all about.

154
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,842
Even the Simpson family
immigrated to America.

155
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:07,836
Right, Grampa?

156
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,967
Okay, you
twisted my arm.

157
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:13,104
The Simpson story begins
back in the old country.

158
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,062
<i>I forget which one exactly.</i>

159
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,524
<i>My father would drone</i>
<i>on and on about America.</i>

160
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,065
<i>He thought it was</i>

161
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,149
<i>the greatest thing</i>
<i>since sliced bread--</i>

162
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,494
<i>sliced bread having been invented</i>
<i>the previous winter.</i>

163
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,951
See this, son?

164
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,910
That's where we're
going to live.

165
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,081
Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow...

166
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,660
but someday.

167
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:37,504
<i>Later that day,</i>
<i>we set sail for America.</i>

168
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,172
There it is.

169
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,380
Our new home.

170
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,469
Whee!
I love America!

171
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,378
Abe! Supper's on!

172
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,467
We had to move out once we'd
filled the head with garbage.

173
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,473
The end.

174
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,809
Yeah, when those immigrants
get deported

175
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,393
there'll be
a lot more elbow room

176
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,518
for regular Joes
like you and me, Apu.

177
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,895
Ah... Mr. Simpson,

178
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,611
it may astonish you
to learn

179
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,941
that I am
an immigrant.

180
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,356
You? Pfft.

181
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,784
I don't believe it.

182
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,112
No, in truth
an illegal immigrant, sir.

183
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,198
If Proposition 24 passes,

184
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,453
I shall be forced
to leave this country.

185
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,576
Oh, I wish...

186
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,503
Oh, I wish I could have stayed
just one more year or two.

187
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,673
There was so much
I wanted to see

188
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,882
and to do
and to have done to me.

189
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,382
Oh, my God.

190
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,054
I got so swept up

191
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,802
in the scapegoating
and fun of Proposition 24,

192
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,255
I never stopped to think

193
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,805
it might affect
someone I cared about.

194
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,190
You know what, Apu...

195
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,978
I am really,
really gonna miss you.

196
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,944
(whistling)

197
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,789
You know what really
aggravazes me?

198
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,461
Is them immiggants--

199
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,830
They want all
the benefits

200
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,126
of living
in Springfield,

201
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,499
but they ain't
even bothered

202
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,165
to learn themself
the language.

203
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,174
Yeah. Those are exactly
my sentimonies.

204
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,217
(babbling incoherently)

205
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,301
Yeah,
you said it, Barn.

206
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,808
Make the protesters go away

207
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,186
and I'll give you
the entire bottle.

208
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,364
Oh, thank you goodness.

209
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,691
My first customers
in a week.

210
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,737
It's hard to believe someone
so close to our family

211
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,242
could be an illegal alien.

212
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,663
Alas, it is true.

213
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,371
I came here shortly
after my graduation

214
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,502
from Cal Tech--

215
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,409
<i>Calcutta Technical Institute.</i>

216
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,957
<i>As the top student</i>

217
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,130
<i>in my graduating class</i>
<i>of seven million,</i>

218
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,799
<i>I was accepted for</i>
<i>graduate study</i>

219
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,458
<i>in the United States.</i>

220
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,218
Wherever you go
and whatever you do,

221
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,346
we will always love you.

222
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,233
Make us proud, son.

223
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,350
Never forget
who you are.

224
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,517
I won't, Mother,

225
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,815
and I won't
forget you, Manjula.

226
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,228
I'm so sorry
our arranged marriage

227
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,438
will not come to pass.

228
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,277
Farewell, my beloved.

229
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,952
<i>I enrolled at</i>
<i>Springfield Heights</i>

230
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,571
<i>Institute of Technology</i>

231
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,657
<i>under the tutelage</i>
<i>of the brilliant</i>

232
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,623
<i>Professor John Frink.</i>

233
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,373
Well, sure, the Frinkiac 7
looks impressive--

234
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,706
Don't touch it.

235
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,130
But I predict
that within 100 years

236
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,459
computers will be
twice as powerful

237
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,125
10,000 times larger
and so expensive

238
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:35,974
that only the five richest kings
of Europe will own them.

239
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,182
Could it be used
for dating?

240
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,562
Well, theoretically, yes,

241
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,639
but the computer matches
would be so perfect

242
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:46,055
as to eliminate the thrill
of romantic conquest.

243
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,225
(mumbling)

244
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,863
Nine glorious
years later

245
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,229
I completed
my Ph.D. thesis.

246
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,107
200,000 precisely
ordered punch cards

247
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,275
comprising the world's
very first

248
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,824
tic-tac-toe program.

249
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,577
Only the top human
players could beat it.

250
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,990
Hey, what's this one for?

251
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,078
Ohh!

252
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,708
So, Apu, why didn't you
go back to India

253
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,831
when your Student Visa
expired?

254
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,498
I did not feel
right leaving

255
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,336
without paying off
my student loans.

256
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,671
Mm-hmm.

257
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,176
So I took a job
at the Kwik-E-Mart.

258
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,348
When my debts were wiped clean,
I was all set to go,

259
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,558
but by then, I had made
so many friends here.

260
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,390
What you're saying
is so understandable

261
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,556
and really, your only crime
was violating U.S. law.

262
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,146
Oh, you are one
of the good ones.

263
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,482
You know what?

264
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,526
I'm going to vote "no" on 24.

265
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,321
Mom, you're the greatest.

266
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,405
Can I have this licorice?

267
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,502
Uh, good evening, young man.

268
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,620
My name is Charles Norwood.

269
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,708
Furthermore, to this beer,

270
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:54,423
I would also like three
of your finest, cheapest cigars.

271
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,965
Here's my I.D.,
which confirms my adultivity.

272
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,719
Hm.

273
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,184
Hey, Kearney, this fake I.D.,
it is truly excellent.

274
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,727
Say, if you tell me
where you obtained it,

275
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,572
I will overlook
the ice cream sandwiches

276
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,228
concealed in
your armpits, eh?

277
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,986
Deal.

278
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,775
Okay, here are
your fraudulent documents

279
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,948
Mr. Nahasapeemapetilan:

280
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,406
your U.S. Passport,
Social Security card

281
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,577
birth certificate
and your death certificate.

282
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,747
Just hold on to that one
in your safe-deposit box.

283
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,417
Most humble and grateful
thanks to you.

284
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,176
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

285
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,428
Can the courtesy.

286
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,889
You're an American now.

287
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,889
Remember: you were born
in Green Bay, Wisconsin,

288
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,312
your parents were Herb
and Judy Nahasapeemapetilan,

289
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,812
and if you do not wish
to arouse suspicion,

290
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,145
I strongly urge you
to act American.

291
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,819
(American accent)
Hey there, Homer.

292
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,032
How's it hanging?

293
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,281
Low and lazy.

294
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,742
So...

295
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,195
Hey, say something again.

296
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,294
Oh, you're just noticing

297
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,209
the way I'm talking
to you now.

298
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,078
You see, it turns out

299
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,745
I am an American citizen
after all.

300
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,844
Apparently, I just
plumb forgot about it.

301
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,461
(phony chuckle)

302
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,677
Say, let's take a relaxed
attitude toward work

303
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,679
and watch
the baseball match.

304
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,511
The NY Mets are my
favorite squadron.

305
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:30,517
Hey, you got rid of that goofy
sacred elephant statue.

306
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,771
Oh, yeah.

307
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,152
What was I thinking
with that?

308
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,690
(accent slipping) Who needs the infinite
compassion of Ganesha

309
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,566
when I've got Tom Cruise
and Nicole Kidman

310
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,164
staring at me
from Entertainment Weekly

311
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,910
with their dead eyes?!

312
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,371
Look at me!

313
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,831
I've betrayed my Indian
heritage, sir.

314
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:53,372
What would my parents
think of me now?

315
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,747
(gasps)

316
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,254
APU'S FATHER:
Make us proud, son.

317
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,915
APU'S MOTHER:
Never forget who you are.

318
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,884
Don't make
the same mistake I did.

319
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,506
(gasps)

320
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:07,222
Oh, forgive me, Mother, Father.

321
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,644
I failed you.

322
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,098
(sniffling)

323
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,559
Who am I kidding?

324
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,897
I am no citizen.

325
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,782
Th-This passport
is a cheap forgery.

326
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,320
A cheap $2,000 forgery.

327
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,365
I have brought shame
to my parents,

328
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,118
to my homeland and to myself.

329
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,120
Don't forget Ganesha.

330
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,368
I cannot deny my roots

331
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,785
and I cannot keep up
this charade.

332
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,375
I only did it
because I love this land

333
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,340
where I have the freedom
to say and to think

334
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,012
and to charge
whatever I want.

335
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,720
I want to stay,
but as the real me,

336
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,101
not as some yahoo
from Green Bay.

337
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,176
(sobbing)

338
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,398
Wow. You must
love this country

339
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,228
more than I love
a cold beer

340
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,114
on a hot
Christmas morning.

341
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,530
Darn it, Apu.

342
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,939
I'm not gonna let them
kick you out.

343
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,198
(grunting)

344
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,239
I never should have
bought this button.

345
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,413
Can I have
my three dollars back?

346
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,370
Store credit only.

347
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,037
HOMER: Hey, Marge.
Look who I brought home.

348
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:19,252
Oh, Homer. Are you
rounding up immigrants?

349
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,375
(laughs)
No, Marge.

350
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,422
Apu convinced me
that Proposition 24

351
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,915
is a big mistake.

352
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:25,927
All right!

353
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,008
Now you've got

354
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,892
all the Simpsons
behind you, Apu.

355
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,549
That's nice--
although three of you

356
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,888
are below voting age.

357
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,642
And I'm not registered.

358
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,524
I do appreciate
your concern, really,

359
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,771
but it is hopeless.

360
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,232
The latest poll shows

361
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,692
a whooping 85% support
for Proposition 24.

362
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,734
Hey, Apu,
why don't you just

363
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,687
marry some American broad

364
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,448
then dump her after you
get your citizenship?

365
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,490
(touch tones)

366
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,373
Hello, Selma?

367
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,490
Selma, my dear,
how are you?

368
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,617
Uh-huh...
uh-huh... uh-huh...

369
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,674
Listen,
shut up for a second.

370
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,498
How would you like
to marry Apu

371
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,503
so he doesn't get deported?

372
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,214
I'd rather eat poison.

373
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,554
My name's already Selma Bouvier
Terwilliger Hutz McClure.

374
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,761
God knows it's long enough
with Nahasapeemapet-whatever.

375
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,722
From now on,
I'm only marrying for love...

376
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,894
and possibly
once more for money.

377
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,937
Oh, it's hopeless.
Oh, poor Apu.

378
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,110
Hey! The government
don't control the sky.

379
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,110
What if you lived
in a balloon?!

380
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,702
-LISA: That's it!
-Did you hear that, Mom?

381
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,068
She's as dumb as me.

382
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,874
No, not what he said,
what he is!

383
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,279
Grandfather,

384
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,367
as in "grandfather clause."

385
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,082
Apu, how long ago
did your Visa expire?

386
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,673
Seven years, but I don't--

387
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,248
(gasps)
There was an amnesty declared

388
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,883
for people who've been here
as long as you.

389
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,551
That means you can take
the citizenship test!

390
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,759
(gasps)

391
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,169
But Apu, the vote
on Proposition 24

392
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,547
is on Tuesday.

393
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,143
You'll have to pass
the test before then.

394
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,599
Oh, no! That is not
nearly enough time

395
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,350
to learn over 200 years
of American history.

396
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,813
Oh, it can't be that many!

397
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,232
Come on, Apu!

398
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,730
I'll be your tutor.

399
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,612
(ominous chords blare)

400
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,605
Please identify
this object.

401
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,114
It appears to be the flag

402
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,445
which disappeared from
the public library last year.

403
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,911
Correct.

404
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,701
Now, we all know the 13 stripes
are for good luck,

405
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:21,285
but why does the American flag
have precisely 47 stars?

406
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:25,383
Because this particular flag
is ridiculously out of date.

407
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,211
The library
must have purchased it

408
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,296
during the brief period
in 1912

409
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,470
after New Mexico
became a state

410
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,509
but before Arizona did.

411
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,392
Uh, partial credit.

412
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,849
Now, they may ask you
to locate your town

413
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,270
on a map of the U.S.,
so let's do that.

414
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,979
Uh... Springfield,
Springfield... um...

415
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,151
-right here.
-LISA: Dad!

416
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,899
{\an8}You're not pointing
anywhere near Springfield.

417
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,232
{\an8}It's over here, Apu.

418
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,817
Hey, whatcha doin'?
Studying?

419
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,902
Oh, I'm so confused.
I don't even know where

420
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,607
I'm getting
kicked out of anymore.

421
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,955
Whoa!

422
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,460
Sign's floating
away, Chief.

423
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,802
Executive, legislative,
and, uh... judicial.

424
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:12,129
No, no, and no.
(groans)

425
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,136
Maybe we should start all over
with the electrical college.

426
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,599
Please, Mr. Simpson,
my brain needs sleep.

427
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,259
The test is in six hours

428
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,138
and many of these facts
you speak of

429
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,175
are completely new to me.

430
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,187
Sleep is for the weak, Apu!

431
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,599
Now I'm gonna go to bed
while you look over

432
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,767
my notes from
ninth grade history.

433
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:28,936
Okay, Apu.

434
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,984
Stay awake and stay focused.

435
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,238
Cotton Mather...

436
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,199
(snoring)

437
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,366
Oh, no! I fell asleep!

438
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,003
I have forgotten everything
that Mr. Homer taught me!

439
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,001
Perfect.
Let's roll.

440
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,011
(crowd clamoring)

441
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:58,971
Hm.

442
00:18:59,054 --> 00:18:59,974
Hm!

443
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:02,894
Hmm.

444
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,861
(gasps)

445
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,148
All right, men.

446
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,691
Here's the order
of deportations.

447
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,944
First, you'll be
rounding up your tired,

448
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,526
then your poor,

449
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,911
then your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free.

450
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,450
Breathers. Got it.

451
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,333
{\an8}All right. Here's
your last question.

452
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,660
What was the cause
of the Civil War?

453
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,655
Actually,
there were numerous causes.

454
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,287
Aside from the obvious schism

455
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,004
between abolitionists
and anti-abolitionists,

456
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,745
economic factors, both domestic
and international, played a significant--

457
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,838
-Hey, hey.
-Yeah?

458
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,382
Just-- Just say "slavery."

459
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,505
Slavery it is, sir.

460
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,141
Yes! I am a citizen!

461
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,680
Now which way to
the Welfare office?!

462
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,474
-What?
-I'm kidding,

463
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,188
I'm kidding!
I work, I work.

464
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,638
Thank you.

465
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,268
I want to say "thank you"
to everyone.

466
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,565
From this day forth

467
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,648
I am no longer an Indian
living in America.

468
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,815
I am an Indian-American.

469
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:57,864
(cheering, applause)

470
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,356
MAN: Here, here, here.

471
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,408
You know, Apu,
in a way,

472
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,781
all Americans
are immigrants,

473
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,328
except Native Americans.

474
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,121
Yeah. Native Americans
like us.

475
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,455
No, I mean
American Indians.

476
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,579
-Like me.
-No, I mean--

477
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,166
-(tapping)
-Hi, everyone!

478
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,171
If I could just say
a few words...

479
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,263
I'd be a better
public speaker.

480
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,169
(laughing)

481
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,677
Now that you're all relaxed--
(clears throat)

482
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,180
most of us here
were born in America.

483
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,722
We take this country
for granted;

484
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,556
but not immigrants like Apu.

485
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,562
While the rest of us are
drinking ourselves stupid,

486
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,645
they're driving the cabs
that get us home safely.

487
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,611
They're writing the operas
that entertain us every day.

488
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,782
They're training our tigers
and kicking our extra points.

489
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,702
These people are the glue

490
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:44,281
that holds together the gears
of our society.

491
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,908
If we pass Proposition 24,
we'll be losing

492
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,246
some of the truest
Americans of all.

493
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,542
-(cheering)
-MOE: You said it, Homer!

494
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,705
When you go
to the polls tomorrow,

495
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:57,714
please, vote no
on Proposition 24.

496
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,218
ALL (chanting):
No on 24.

497
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,140
No on 24.

498
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,720
No on 24.

499
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,176
No on 24.

500
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,227
No on 24.

501
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,981
No on 24.

502
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,984
No on 24.

503
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,236
<i>It's a landslide!</i>
<i>Yes on 24.</i>

504
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,950
<i>The Proposition passed</i>
<i>with a record 95%...</i>

505
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,453
When are people going
to learn--

506
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,366
democracy doesn't work.

507
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,874
Please don't knock
the land that I love.
