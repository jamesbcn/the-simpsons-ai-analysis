{\an8}Nobody told us how tough
it is to raise kids.

park them in front of the TV.

46
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,228
{\an8}That's how I was raised,
and I turned out TV.

47
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,114
{\an8}I'd see them sitting on that
couch all day long,

49

Our favorite show was <i>Hollywood Hogwash.</i>

00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,582
But we also loved <i>The Dreck Squad.</i>

51
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,122

But we never saw people like us on TV.

55
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,798
TV families were always hugging
and tackling issues.

56
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,603
Homer kept saying he could do
a more realistic family show.

57
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,758
Finally, I said, "So, do it."

It was amazing how fast

80
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,444
Dad betrayed his vision

81

of a realistic show.

82
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,570
OK, the material was a little corny

83
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,569
but Homer and I
had real chemistry onscreen.

84
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,487
Every day, I thought about firing Marge--

85
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,161
You know, just to shake things up.

110
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,375
I first knew the show was a hit
when I walked

111
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,676
into school and a kid was wearing

112
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,969
a Bart Simpson t-shirt.

113
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,637
<i>Fox had an endless supply</i>
<i>of clever slogans, man.</i>

114
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,311
Suddenly, I was invited
to every birthday party.

115
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,142
Sometimes, I'd have to read the cake

116

We were using $50 bills as toilet paper

<i>When we come back...</i>

178
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,123
I want to set the record straight.

179
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:23,422
I thought the cop was a prostitute.

00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,508
NARRATOR: <i>When </i>Behind The Laughter

181
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,630

{\an8}(rock music)

183
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,564
NARRATOR: <i>By the end</i>
<i>of their first season,</i>

184
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,892
<i>the Simpsons were burning up</i>

185
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,016
<i>Nielsen Boxes in the U.S.</i>

186
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,113
<i>and creating a sensation overseas.</i>

187
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,689
HOMER: <i>Hello, Mr. Lobster.</i>

188
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,694
<i>D'oh!</i>

189
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,609
(goofy, British-accented laughter)

190
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,154
Oh, dear...

191
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,367
<i>Bathtubs of money,</i>

192
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,198
<i>wheelbarrows of awards,</i>

193
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,203
<i>fire hoses of respect--</i>

194
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,865
<i>The Simpsons had it all.</i>

195
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:02,254
(whooping and cheering)

196
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,133
(bored, halfhearted quasi-cheers)

197
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,341
(groans)

198
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,420
<i>But behind the streamers and confetti,</i>

199
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,256
<i>storm clouds were gathering.</i>

200
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,297
(thunder crashing)

201
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,215
<i>Figurative storm clouds.</i>

202
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:17,933
{\an8}Oh, Homer was spending money
like a teenage Arab, heh.

203
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,229
He bought me a Rolex and Cashmere jeans.

204
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,440
I felt kind of guilty

205
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,350
'cause I was always trying

206
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,807
to score with his wife.

207
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,653
So, when do we start filming?

208
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,993
Oh.

209
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,028
{\an8}Even Bart was throwing dough around.

210
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,862
{\an8}He paid me and Carl a 1000 bucks

211
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,027
{\an8}to kiss each other.

212
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,987
Hey, did we ever get that money?

213
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,868
NARRATOR: <i>But reckless spending</i>
<i>and interracial homoeroticism</i>

214
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,416
<i>were just volume one</i>

215
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,959
<i>of </i>The <i>Encyclopedia Self-Destructica.</i>

216
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,549
<i>Even more harrowing were the events</i>

217
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,182
<i>of one April afternoon.</i>

218
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,722
(spring squeaking)

219
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,524
The script originally called
for me to jump the gorge,

220
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,679
but I'd been up all night
paying people to kiss,

221
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,517
so Dad volunteered to do the stunt.

222
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,730
Everything was going great at first.

223
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,523
I felt like I was king of the world.

224
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,188
<i>I'm king of the world! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!</i>

225
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,277
Right about here
I realize something's wrong.

226
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,202
-(screaming)

227
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,360
Yup, there I go.

228
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,195
Then came the rocks...

229
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,778
Jagged rocks...

230
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,290
-Hitting me with their jags.
-(groaning)

231
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,080
NARRATOR: <i>The sequence became</i>
<i>an instant comedy classic</i>

232
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,918
{\an8}<i>but what the audience didn't see</i>

233
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,630
{\an8}<i>was the unfunny aftermath.</i>

234
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,760
(agonized screaming)

235
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,008
Mmm.

236
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,222
NARRATOR: <i>Somehow, Homer became</i>

237
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,722
<i>addicted to painkillers.</i>

238
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,604
<i>It was the only way he could perform</i>

239
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,220
<i>-the bone-cracking physical comedy...</i>
<i>-Ow! My leg!</i>

240
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,267
NARRATOR: <i>...that made him a star.</i>

241
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,060
This is the worst pain ever.

242
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,903
Stop pummeling me!

243
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,018
(screaming)

244
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,194
It's really painful!

245
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,783
Why did I take such punishment?

246
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,283
Let's just say that fame was like a drug.

247
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,699
But, what was even more
like a drug was the drugs.

248
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,371
NARRATOR: <i>But despite</i>
<i>their mounting problems,</i>

249
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,529
<i>the Simpsons' star continued to rise</i>

250
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,658
<i>like a plastic bag caught in an updraft.</i>

251
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,871
<i>LISA: It was such an honor</i>

252
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,115
<i>to be on the Walk of Fame.</i>

253
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,417
<i>I mean, there we were</i>

254
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,540
<i>with Hollywood royalty</i>

255
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,836
<i>like Milton Berle</i>

256
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,299
<i>and Nelson Mandela...</i>

257
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,838
And just a few stars down
from the Cheerios Honey Bee.

258
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,545
{\an8}Awards and honors are great,

259
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,845
{\an8}but they don't pay the pickle man.

260
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,469
We were earning millions,

261
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,345
but we were always strapped for cash.

262
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,522
{\an8}One time, Lisa bought a first edition

263
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,981
{\an8}of <i>Susan B. Anthony Man.</i>

264
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,860
<i>Her check bounced higher than Rubber Girl.</i>

265
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,146
NARRATOR: <i>Where did the money go?</i>

266
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,902
<i>Marge lost much of the family fortune</i>

267
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,105
<i>investing in birth control products.</i>

268
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,776
I learned something.

269
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,156
When people reach for their diaphragm,

270
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,452
they don't want to see my picture.

271
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,207
NARRATOR: <i>As the Simpsons'</i>
<i>money dwindled,</i>

272
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,618
<i>their expenses soared.</i>

273
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,748
<i>From the original group of five,</i>

274
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,674
<i>the cast ballooned to dozens...</i>

275
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,960
<i>then hundreds.</i>

276
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,593
I'd never acted before in my life

277
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,135
but, uh, if the sea captain
could be in the show,

278
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,636
{\an8}why not me?

279
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,101
{\an8}I've even got a catch phrase.

280
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,471
{\an8}(imitating Edward G. Robinson) Nyah...

281
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,887
(quacking)

282
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,436
No. I lost it.

283
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,689
NARRATOR: <i>Then another bombshell.</i>

284
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,231
<i>An anonymous tipster alerted Uncle Sam</i>

285
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,529
<i>that the Simpsons were evading</i>
<i>their income taxes.</i>

286
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,027
{\an8}(Apu's voice) Yes, I finked on Homer, but,
you know, he deserved it.

287
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,115
{\an8}Never have I seen such abuse

288
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,120
{\an8}of the "take a penny, leave a penny" tray.

289
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,961
{\an8}NARRATOR: <i>The tax men were merciless.</i>

290
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,039
Hey! What the...

291
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,094
(screams)

292
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,971
{\an8}Hey, they can't take our house.

293
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,764
My potbellied pig is in there.

295
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,808
Oh, Mr. Porky.

296
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,099
(weeping)

297
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,444
NARRATOR: <i>Inevitably,</i>
<i>the behind-the-scenes turmoil</i>

298
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,571
<i>took its toll on their TV series.</i>

299

{\an8}DIRECTOR: And... action!

300
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,691
{\an8}Hold on. Cut.

301
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,988
-(groans) For crying out loud.
-Oh, man.

302
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,491
DIRECTOR: Bart, if it's not
too much trouble...

303
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,624
Fine. I'll do <i>Teen Wolf III.</i>

304
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,451
I've got fair-weather friends to feed.

305
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,869
Dad, I want to go to bed.

306
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,996
Aren't there child labor laws?

307
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,963
Who told you about those laws?

308
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,837
Was it Marge?

309
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,261
Hey, you've been riding me all day.

310
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,719
Why don't you poop in your hat?

311
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,682
Are you going to need us tonight?

312
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,219
I have ballet tickets.

313
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,392
Not that they'll do much good now.

(laughing)

351
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,469
Now, Homer, this is no time

352
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,224
to be thinking about food.

353
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,096
Yeah, forget the donuts.

354
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,932
We're here to go nuts...

355
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,483
Musically, that is.

356
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,311
What kind of songs should we play?

357
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:01,066
Something that swings
with the beat of New Orleans.

358
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,820
No. Something that rocks.

359
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,652
That's the sound of today.

360
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,947
-Swings.
-Rocks.

361
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,410
-Swings.
-Rocks.

NARRATOR: <i>Sadly, this argument</i>

363
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,414
<i>was not part of the act.</i>

364
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,742
I'll kill you!

365
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,037
(groans) You don't have
the guts, little man.

366
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,670
Folks, we're just having
a little family tiff.

367
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,959
If you'll just bear with us...

368
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,292
Oh, shut up.

369
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,836
Always trying to act so mature.

370
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,170
I'm glad you make the least money.

371
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,134
Oh, that's it.

372
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,091
-Hey! Hey, stop it!
-Stop it!

373
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,675

<i>Coming up...</i>

<i>Was the dream really over?</i>

387
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,666
<i>Yes, it was.</i>

388
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,881
<i>Or was it?</i>

389
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,921
<i>And Homer finds a new passion...</i>

390
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,339
<i>Dusting and polishing mixing boards.</i>

394
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,358
NARRATOR: <i>The Simpsons'</i>
<i>TV show started out</i>

395
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,899
<i>on a wing and a prayer,</i>

396
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,146

397

<i>After the state fair fiasco,</i>

401
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,372
<i>none of the family</i>

402

{\an8}<i>Fox put the show on hiatus</i>

403
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,290
{\an8}<i>and replaced it with hidden camera footage</i>

00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,462
<i>from the dressing room at Ann Taylor.</i>

405
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,288
That slugfest at the state fair
was really a blessing.

406
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,958
It gave us a chance
to pursue solo projects.

407
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:50,337
I returned to my first love,
the legitimate theater.

408
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,677
As a young female artist,

409
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,522
I really love living
in this East Village loft.

410
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,978
-(knocking)
-Oh,

411
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,178
that must be our new landlord,

00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,098
Mr. Stingeley.

413
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,146

<i>Bart replaced Lorenzo Lamas</i>

425
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,174
I hear that, Renegade.

426
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,546
Let's do this thing.

427
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,387
NARRATOR: <i>Marge put together</i>
<i>a nightclub act.</i>

428
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,176

<i>♪ She didn't do it ♪</i>

433
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,489
So the next time you see a sheriff,

434
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,358
-shoot him...
-(all gasping)

435
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,985
-...a smile!
-(all sighing)

436
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,822
Good night, Laughlin!

437
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:55,907

NARRATOR: <i>Lisa "sang," too,</i>

<i>in a tell-all book blasting the family.</i>

442
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,582
To prolong the run of the series,

443
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,747
I was secretly given anti-growth hormones.

444
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:09,757
(all gasping)

445
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,508
(shutters clicking)

446
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,260
That's ridiculous.

447
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,262
How could I even get
all five necessary drops

448
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,755
into her cereal?

449
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,061
What?

450
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,060
{\an8}In that family, nobody trusted nobody.

451
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,940
They even brought their lawyers
to Thanksgiving dinner.

452
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,605
So, uh...

453
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,570
How's everybody doing?

454
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,862
You don't have to answer that.

455
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,905
Shut up, all of you, or I'll sue!

456
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,994
Oh, save it for your next book,
you little snitch.

457
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,325
{\an8}That's assault! That is assault!

458
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,655
It was the best Thanksgiving ever.

459
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,617
I mean, emotionally, it was terrible.

460
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,287
But the turkey was so moist.

461
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,417
NARRATOR: <i>The carcass</i>
<i>of The Simpsons' empire</i>

462
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,884
<i>had been picked clean.</i>

463
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,799
<i>But then came help</i>
<i>from an unexpected source.</i>

464
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,474
{\an8}I knew there was only one person

465
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,474
{\an8}who could reunite this troubled clan--

466
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,426
{\an8}My old fraternity brother, Willie Nelson.

467
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,519
{\an8}I'd do anything for Kegmeister Julius,

468
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,614
{\an8}so I cooked up a phony awards show.

469
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,690
(warning buzzer)

470
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,935
Not again!

471
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,947
Time-saver, my ass!

472
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,608
When Willie asked me to be a presenter

473
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,197
at the New Awareness Awards,

474
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,532
I had to think about it...

475
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,490
for about a microsecond!

476
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,577
You just don't say "no"
to the redheaded stranger.

477
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,503
And when I heard it was for awareness,

478
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,082
that sealed the deal.

479
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,917
NARRATOR: <i>Would Willie's</i>
<i>fence-mending eggs</i>

480

<i>bear fruit</i>

481
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,545
<i>or would his olive branch</i>

482

<i>be torn apart</i>

483
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,799

<i>That night, fate wore</i>

486
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,178
<i>a cumberbund of suspense...</i>

(applause)

488
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,518
Thank you, Taco, for that loving tribute
to Falco.

489
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:51,185
And now to present the award
for "Most Violent Rap Group,"

490
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:52,902
Homer Simpson!

491
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,993
-Hi.
-(applause)

492
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,858
And Marge Simpson!

493
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,236
What?

494
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,662
(applause)

495
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,030
What's she doing here?

496
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,366
And Bart and Lisa Simpson.

497
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,037
(gasps)

498
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,000
Hey, what's going on?

499
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,210
Well, I'll be honest.

500
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,500
The New Awareness Awards

501
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,043
are all an elaborate sham.

502
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,705
What? (sputters) I knew it was too good
to be true.

503
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,680
So this whole thing was just
a trick to get us back together.

504
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,312
I'm also trying to patch things up

505
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,268
between Van Halen and Sammy Hagar.

506
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,176
(both groan)

507
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,517
But the main thing is for you folks

508
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,062
to stop this silly feud.

509
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,555
Isn't that right, people?

510
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,357
(cheering)

511
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,862

{\an8}the show and the Sunday comic strip.
