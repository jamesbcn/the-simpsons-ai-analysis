4
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,853
Our first anniversary.

5
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:23,307
And we're more in love than ever.

6

it wouldn't last a year!

7

{\an8}Oh, Homer, you're
the anchor store of my heart.

37
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,893
{\an8}Just call me Borders Books,

38
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,273

{\an8}Oh, Homie, what a wonderful anniversary.

43

45

48

{\an8}But somehow our anniversaries
didn't get better

52

{\an8}than that first one on the train.

53
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,865
{\an8}Wait, you named me after a train?

54
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,115
{\an8}Yeah, just like we did with Bart.

55
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,127
{\an8}Anyway, this year, I'm gonna re-create

56
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,379
{\an8}our magical first anniversary,

57
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,051
{\an8}ending with a romantic ride
on that... (gasps)

58
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,125
{\an8}Why are you taking away the train?

59
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,297
{\an8}I'm afraid no one rides it anymore

60
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,806
{\an8}despite millions in government subsidies.

61
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,059
{\an8}So we're replacing it
with something that makes money

62
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,311
{\an8}and sends people to the food court.

63
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,733
{\an8}Step right up. Medical marijuana.

64
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,272
{\an8}You got nausea, my friend?
Everyone's got nausea.

65
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,737
{\an8}And what is your malady, my son?

66
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,488
{\an8}Uh, I had one, but I forgot it.

67
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,951
{\an8}Memory loss!

68
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,621
{\an8}Could be a brain tumor.

69
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,909
{\an8}Take this and go see <i>Fantasia.</i>

70

{\an8}(Homer moaning sadly)

71
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,366
{\an8}Kids, I've only had three great ideas--

72
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,826
{\an8}marrying your mother,
using a hot dog as a straw

73
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,208
{\an8}and this romantic train ride anniversary.

74
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,295
{\an8}Sir, I need this train.

75
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,880
{\an8}Eh, take it home. It's yours.

76
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,045
{\an8}Are you sure Mom is really gonna want

77
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,804
{\an8}a rusted-out kiddie train?

78
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,426
{\an8}She won't see it like this.

79
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,182
{\an8}I'll make this train look as beautiful

80
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,394
{\an8}as it did when this mall was young.

81
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,805
{\an8}Aw, Dad, I just got
a little twinge in my heart.

82
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,895
{\an8}-Try this.
-You stay away from my kids

83
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,730
{\an8}unless you're driving them to school!

84
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,395
{\an8}So, I'm not babysitting tomorrow night?

85
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,065
Oh, we're still on for tomorrow night.

86
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,083
Dad, do we have to ride like this?

87
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,659
Hey, what could be cooler than
a choo-choo with lollipops on it?

88
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:10,706
Hey, babies-- where you
going in your baby train?

89
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,252
Babytown?

90
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,085
Shake it off, kids-- they're just jealous.

91
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,631
Hey, lardo, where you
going in your lardo car?

92
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,925
Lardville?

93
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,338
There's no such place!

95
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,474
Okay. I've entered my billing address,

96
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,097
expiration date... and charged.

97
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,185
We're back from "Baby Beethovens."

00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,319
Well, thanks for watching Maggie.

102

Must be tough.

103
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,664
Yeah, what size cuff links
do you get an elephant?

104
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,873
Well, in the first place,
the elephant's cuff links

105
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,285
would be the same size.

106
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,923
It's the cuffs that would be bigger.

107
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,380
As for Homer, I'm getting him a case

108
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,170
of his favorite snack cakes,
Dolly Madison.

109
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,764
Marge, this isn't Dolly Madison.

110
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,130
It's Sassy Madison.

111
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:04,097
Trust me, Homer doesn't care
where the cupcakes come from.

112

Sassy Madison is a dating site

As much a sin as not replying

00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:53,056
{\an8}<i>MAN: Thanks for your note.</i>
<i>You seem way too nice for this site.</i>

175
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,479
{\an8}<i>-Why are you here?</i>
-Good question.

176
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,228
"I thought I was buying snack cakes."

177
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,111
{\an8}<i>That's so cute. Really, really cute.</i>

178
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,149
{\an8}<i>You... you are over 18, right?</i>

179
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,532
"I am, and you seem more interested

180
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,450
in my day than my husband."

181
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,908
{\an8}<i>I know what it's like</i>

{\an8}<i>And by the way, this is my real voice.</i>

When Marge is asleep,
I'll sneak back.

188
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,553
Oh, good, the strippers are here.

189
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,719
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!
That is all coming off.

00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,302
"Tell me more."

(groans)

193
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,902
Homie, I bet you're wondering

194
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,269
why I stayed on
the computer until 4:00 a.m.

195
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,358
Hey, those Yelp reviews
don't write themselves.

196
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,993
Did you know a well-placed
one star can destroy

197
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,111
a mom-and-pop hardware in nothing flat?

198
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,118
Listen, I want us
to be honest with each other.

199
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,991
<i>HOMER:</i>
<i>Uh-oh. If you're honest,</i>

201
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,288
Huh? What train?

202
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,793

Oh!

208
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,507
Um, Marge, I have to go.

209
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,893
What? Now? Why?

210
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,556
(shrieks)

213
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,230
He's writing me again.

214
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,775
Better put a stop to this.

215
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,149
(phone dings nearby)

216
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,236
Is that him getting the text?

217

(phone dings nearby)

218
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,327
He's in the market.

219
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,829
We might have squeezed
the same tomatoes.

220
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,621
Are you Marge?

221
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,035
Ooh, I'm going to hell.

222
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,174
I'm sorry. I didn't even
know you were here.

223
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,551
What a crazy coincidence
that you buy food, too.

224
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,798
Gee, I thought you'd be
some kind of creep.

225
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,471
But you're actually
a perfectly normal-looking...

226
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,221
Whoa! "A" is for "apple," right?

227
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,561
Okay. I'll-I'll just be going.

228
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,310
Wait, wait, wait!
Let me get the stain out.

229
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,813
But not here.

230
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,226
I know a place where no one
in town will see us.

231
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,647
(wind whistling)

232
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,903
(grunts) There you go.

233
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,028
Good as new.

234
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,874
Now, let me at least buy you a coffee,

235
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,289
or dare I say a Danish?

236
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,868
-No Danishes!
-Sorry. I go to pastry way too fast.

237
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,705
I want to be very clear.

238
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,420
I'm a happily married woman.

239
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,210
Going on ten years.

240
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,134
The aluminum anniversary.

241
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:34,132
Nothing turns leftovers
into swans like aluminum.

242
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,506
<i>MARGE:</i>
<i>What the heck am I saying?</i>

(yells)

245
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,635
All worth it for Marge.

246
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,475
Marge, you are terrific.

247
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,270
I am so glad I reset my distance
filter from 15 to 25 miles.

248
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,726
-Mmm...
-Your Homer is the luckiest man on earth.

249
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,897
Well, he keeps falling
down a cliff and living,

250
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,526
so I guess that's true.

251
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,493
The only time my wife and I talk
is when I apologize.

252
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,704
(posh English accent)
"Life's an infernal muddle,"

253
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,245
as Mr. Drake says on <i>Upton Rectory.</i>

254
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,329
Ooh, I love that show.

255
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,745
Isn't it great?

256
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,713
Finally, a reason to watch TV on Sundays.

257
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,884
Such great characters,

258
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,172
like Buxton, the scheming larder-keep.

259
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:18,176
Why can't Lady Cavendish see
he's pilfering the aspic?

260
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,640
(shudders)

261
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,510
Uh, does... does Homer watch?

262
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,727
He says shows set during
World War I are too sad.

263
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,269
Particularly how everyone's
always climbing stairs.

264
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,613
You are watching the season
finale this week, right?

265
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,269
Yeah. Alone, I'm sure.

266
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,278
Well, we could, uh... live blog it.

267
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,531
Save that sugar for your coffee, bub.

268

<i>♪ I've been working on the railroad... ♪</i>

269
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,124
Why are you singing that?

270
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,754
Because it's in the public domain.

271

272
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,340
It's Moe from Moe's Tavern.

273

Oh, uh, I'd better take this.

274
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,717
You see,
Moe's been depressed and needs

275
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,298
to hear a friendly voice.
(chuckles)

276
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,434
Why the hell are you calling me
at home, you moron?!

277
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,682
Lovejoy went to get a hamburger,
and the whole thing fell apart!

278
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,345
I'm getting cooked like a cabbage.

279
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,024
Then keep quiet like a cabbage!

280
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,352
All right, all right, I'll be right there.

281
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,228

283
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:27,204

just get classy?

285
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,250
Mom, Lisa made me break a lamp.

286
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:37,255
Mom, Bart's twisting facts
in an Orwellian fashion.

287
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,219
Can I have one hour of grown-up time

288
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,510
where you two aren't
tattling on each other

289
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,394
or using obscure references?

290
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,061
Orwell, obscure?

291
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,849
The author of <i>Animal Farm?</i>

292
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,272
Grampa says he was a Commie.

293
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,600
No tattling!

00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,551
Love should flower,

even an ill-advised alliance
between a coarse Irish maid

320
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,885

soup from the wrong side.

He hasn't been the same

without a proper ring.

328
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,819
Take mine-- the Star of Bombay.

329
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,026
Once again, India is denuded

330
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,367
of her treasure

00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,777
Our gift is us!

348
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,617
Three kids with no money,
but plenty of love!

349
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,543
-(noisemaker blares)
-(gasps) That's great.

350
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,253
I wonder what surprise
your father has in store.

351
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,884
(Homer yelling and groaning)

352
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,632
HOMER: Boy, oh, boy!

353
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,724
Oh, Marge, I threw my back out!

354
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,050
Can you please refill this
prescription right away?

355
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,217
(sighs) Where's it from?

356
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,136
It's in Drugtown... not the nice part.

357
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,475
That'll take hours! On our anniversary!

358
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,732
And what better way
to spend it than commemorating

359
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:45,025
the glorious words
you spoke ten years ago:

360
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,280
"for worse." Oh!

361
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,952
-Oh!
-Ow!

362
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,070
(groans)

363
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,486
Ooh!

364
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,954
(groans)

365
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,244
(moaning)

366
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,747
-(groans)
-(chuckles)

367
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,958
Hmm.

368
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,459
(chuckling)

369
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,420
It's working.

370
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,088
She's gone.
All right, everyone, magically appear.

371
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,970
Wow, Moe, great shrub costume.

372
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,975
Yeah. I sell 'em on the Internet
for like-minded people.

373
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,938
Now, let's lay some track.

374
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,808
You guys are the best.

375
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,395
I just want you to know

376
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,900
when I'm holding Marge
in my arms tonight,

377
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,193
I'll be thinking of all of you.

378
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,446
(all cheer, then groan)

379
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,491
(dog howling)

380
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,783
When does it get better?

381
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,406
When he's 800 pounds and has to be

382
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,913
cut out of the house to go to a movie?

383
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,999
I lost my cleaning stick in my belly fat.

384
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,293
But I found a kitten.

385
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,786
(meows)

386
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,797
That is so sweet.

387
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,839
There I go again, settling.

388
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,383
Marge, run off with me. Bring your kid.

389
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,927
I have three kids.

390
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,641
Whoa, you really went all in
with this guy, didn't you?

391
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,472
Get out of my head.

392
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,977
I guess this is good-bye, then.

suck it in and smile.

406
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,725

Happy anniversary!

Our train.

415
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,211
{\an8}Homie, you do care.

416
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,956
{\an8}You care a lot.

417
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,678
{\an8}What a wonderful anniversary.

418
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,389
{\an8}Do you think we'll last 25 years?

419
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,720
Nothing should.

420
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,312
Trains... they can fix every marriage.

421
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,313
(phone dings)

422
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,765
What the...?

423
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:30,355
Ugh. Happy moment derailed
by the <i>Bipolar Express.</i>

424
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,442
(chuckles)
None of you heard that.

425
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,028
ALL: Happy anniversary!

426
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,874
Where is she?

427
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,949
Where the hell is Marge Simpson?

428
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,914
Ramona, please! When you asked me
who she was and where she lived,

429
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,865
I never dreamed you'd go confront her!

430
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,206
Mmm, I'm Marge Simpson.

431
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,001
So... you're the kind of man-eater

432
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,126
Hall and Oates warned us all about.

433
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,133
Hall and Oates? What's going on here?

434
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,795
Your wife and my husband

435
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,303
have been watching British TV together!

436
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,556
Costume drama or naughty comedy?

437
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,008
Drama! Drama!

438
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,478
You just dodged a bullet,
Mr. Sugarpants.

439
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,230
Ben, Ramona,
I want to tell you something

440
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,442
I've learned over ten years of marriage.

441
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,693
The secret is: no secrets,

442
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,106
except good secrets like this train.

443
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,775
(indistinct chatter)

444
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,454
My only secrets are:

445
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,742
my marathon time isn't 4:26; it's never,

446
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,867
I often go online to see how Lindsay
Wagner's looking now-- fabulous--

447
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,876
and I once pushed a kid off a swing
and he broke his wrist or something.

448
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,590
But it's no secret
how much I love my Margie.

449
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,882
-Mmm...
-Mmm...

450
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,886
Look at them, coochie-cooing
like that time

451
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,349
our connecting flight
was delayed and we got drunk

452
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,390
and friendly in the Admiral's Club.

453
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:46,103
That was you?
I mean, it-it was wonderful.

454
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,145
And you're fighting for me.

455
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,398
Maybe that means you still care.

456
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,730
Of course I do.

457
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,185
Now, let's go home
and spend a romantic night

458
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,566
looking through your computer's
browsing history.

459
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,283
That exists? Oh, boy.

460
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,744
Honey, just what was going on
with you and that guy?

461
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,746
Well... (clears throat) I was
trying to buy you snack cakes...

462
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,709
Oh, baby, that's all I needed to hear.

463
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:08,999
(moaning)

464
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,842
(classical music playing)

465
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,430
