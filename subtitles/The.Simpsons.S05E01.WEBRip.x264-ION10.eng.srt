Oh, thanks.

351
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,855
Here.

352
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,903
Wow! An award statue!

353
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,697
Oh... it's a Grammy.

354
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,321
(clunk)

355
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,448
MAN: Hey, don't throw
your garbage down here.

356
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,461
Wow! Look at all this Be Sharps
merchandise.

357
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,804
Lunch boxes,

358
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,629
coffee mugs,

359
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,054
funny foam.

360
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,013
They took the foam off
the market,

361
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,553
because they found out
it was poisonous.

362
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,636
But if ask me,
if you're dumb enough to eat it,

363
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,062
you deserve to die.

364
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,060
-Bart!
-What?

365
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,442
I can't believe
you're not still popular.

366
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,399
What'd you do?
Screw up like the Beatles

367
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,270
and say you were
bigger than Jesus?

368
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,816
All the time. It was the title
of our second album.

369
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,946
But we were about to learn
an iron law of show business--

370
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,281
what goes up must come down.

371
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,366
What about Bob Hope?

372
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,452
He's been consistently popular
for over 50 years.

373
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,457
So is Sinatra.

374
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,958
Well, anyway, we were all
getting tired of--

375
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,331
Dean Martin still packs
them in.

376
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,377
-Ditto Tom Jones.
-Shut up!

377
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,341
With your father
on the road all the time,

378
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,841
I tried to compensate
for his absence.

379
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,346
<i>Hi, kids.</i>

380
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,680
<i>I love...</i>

381
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,925
(tape rewinds)

382
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,136
(both scream)

383
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,021
-(pop)
-(screaming)

384
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,727
HOMER:
<i>Meanwhile, the group</i>

385
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,436

<i>of its own.</i>

386
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,276

<i>♪ Poo, poo, pa-doop ♪</i>

391
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,665
This is worse than
your song about Mr. T.

392
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:52,672
I pity the fool
who doesn't like he.

393
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,376
-And where's Barney?
-Oh, he's with his new girlfriend,

394
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,007
the Japanese
conceptual artist.

395
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,097
BARNEY: Barbershop is
in danger of growing stale.

396
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,983
I'm taking it
to strange, new places.

397
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,112
-GIRLFRIEND: <i>Number eight.</i>
<i>-(Barney belches)</i>

398
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,359
<i>-Number eight.</i>
<i>-(Barney belches)</i>

399
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,480
<i>-Number eight.</i>
<i>-(Barney belches)</i>

400
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,108
<i>-Number eight.</i>
<i>-(Barney belches)</i>

401
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,784
<i>-Number eight.</i>
<i>-(Barney belches)</i>

402
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,953
Then came the day
we knew we were finished.

403
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,622
Gentlemen, this magazine
just came out

404
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,792
with its "What's hot
and what's not" issue.

405
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,251
-Are we hot?
-We are not.

406
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,251
HOMER: <i>We all went</i>
<i>our separate ways.</i>

407
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,134
Well, William,
I'm back.

408
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,382
So how did you
spend your summer?

409
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,224
I made millions in software

410
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,840
and lost it at the track, och!

411
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,717
It may not be glamorous,

412
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,635
but it's good, honest work.

413
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,854
-How much is this quart of milk?
-12 dollars.

414
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,607
Hey, Barney, what will it be?

415
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,058
I'd like a beer, Moe.

416
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,768
I'd like a single plum

417
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,358
floating in perfume,

418
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,783
served in a man's hat.

419
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,111
Here you go.

420
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,816
Hey, fellas,
I'm back.

421
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,196
Oh, that's great.

422
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,832
Your replacement
was getting tired.

423
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,739
(clucking)

424
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,037
Hey, Queeny, you can go now.

425
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,291
I'll give her a good home.

426
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,833
And I did.

427
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,296
I'll never forget
my five and a half weeks

428
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,799
-at the top.
-Man, that's some story.

429
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,632
But there are still
a few things I don't get.

430
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,297
Like, how come we never
heard about this until today?

431
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,966
Yeah, and what happened
to the money you made?

432
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,465
Why haven't you hung up
your gold records?

433
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,016
Since when could you
write a song?

434
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,060
There are perfectly good answers
to those questions,

435
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,555
but they'll have to wait
for another night.

436
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,818
Now off to bed.

437
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,500
I can't remember the last time
we were all together.

438
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,174
Last year on that stupid
Dame Edna special.

439
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,514
And a-one and a-two

440
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,669
