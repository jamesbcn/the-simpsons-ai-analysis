1
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,206
I got a few days left!

2
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:47,848
D'oh!

3
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,011
Hey, little lady.

4
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,681
You'd be a lot prettier
if you smiled.

5
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,349
What? Who are you?

6
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,152
I'm a man. So I know
what I'm talking about.

7
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,955
Smile and you'll be
a lot more popular.

8
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,291
Are you serious? You know I'll
remember this forever, right?

9
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:33,727
Well, that's what therapy's for.

10
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:37,364
And he told me I wouldn't be
pretty unless I smiled.

11
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,800
Sweetie, you are very pretty.

12
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,035
And thanks to the puberty app
on my phone,

13
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,804
we can see what lies ahead.

14
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,482
Wait. This can't be real.

15
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,317
I already had braces.

16
00:01:57,384 --> 00:02:00,721
Well, I'm afraid
you have to get them again.

17
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,889
The man we thought was
your orthodontist

18
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,259
was actually
a rogue periodontist.

19
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,062
Rogue periodontist.

20
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,398
This family cheaps out
on everything.

21
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,368
Homer took me
to a psychiatrist.

22
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:18,071
After three sessions, I figured
out it was a goat with glasses.

23
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,140
Never went back.

24
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,977
Braces? Again?

25
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:27,614
Why am I the only one
in this family who needs braces?

26
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,588
Don't look so smug, boy.

27
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,690
Let's try this app on you.

28
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,761
Hello, Aaron Eckhart.

29
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,063
Puberty!

30
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,631
Let's see what comes next.

31
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,767
Cool.

32
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,936
Homie, look.
We got this in the mail today.

33
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,104
Aw, what is it?

34
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,939
Did I get drunk
and buy useless stuff

35
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,241
on eBay again?

36
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,143
Let's get more.

37
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,446
Hello, Simpsons.

38
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,481
It's me, Artie Ziff,

39
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,884
in prerecorded form.

40
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,186
So you can't talk to me.

41
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,087
I can't?

42
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,689
No, you can't.

43
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,957
Pause for laughs.

44
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,225
And thank you.

45
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,027
Artie Ziff?
Isn't that the rich guy

46
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,595
who could have been our dad?

47
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,465
I am the only man
your mother has ever been with,

48
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,734
and she doesn't have
a single regret.

49
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,070
- Well...
- You stay out of this, Marge!

50
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,906
Great news, I'm getting married,
and you're invited!

51
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,975
Why, you ask,
am I getting married?

52
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,112
I've found my soul mate!

53
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,548
Jealous?

54
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,550
April 12th,
very rich man's wedding.

55
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,884
Regrets only.

56
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,152
Chicken or fish.

57
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,787
Or vegan.

58
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,155
Bye!

59
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,590
So, what else is in the mail?

60
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:46,326
We got a flyer from Lowe's!

61
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,762
Three-quarter plywood.

62
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,597
$20 a sheet!

63
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,432
I'm a-comin'!

64
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,835
Oh, I don't have a car.

65
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,837
You're not really thinking
of going, are you?

66
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,839
That jerk kept trying
to break us up.

67
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,309
Now, I am sensing
conflicted feelings.

68
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:06,046
If you come, I promise you
a wonderful time.

69
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,115
Champagne, caviar,

70
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,917
deep-fried ice sculptures,
a guy who guesses your weight,

71
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,086
who always guesses low!

72
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,490
Thank you.

73
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:19,459
And now to celebrate,
here's Tupac Shakur!

74
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,027
<i>Don't be tardy</i>

75
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,463
<i>My boy Artie
is throwing a party</i>

76
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,465
<i>This wedding's gonna be fly</i>

77
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,868
<i>Why won't you people
let me die?</i>

78
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,703
How do you turn this off?

79
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,705
There's no off
to the Artie show.

80
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:34,374
- I decide when...
- Please set me free.

81
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,876
Oh, here it is.

82
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,778
God bless you.

83
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:47,053
Now everyone's favorite,
rinse and spit.

84
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,091
And I'm done...
with the top braces.

85
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,059
We'll put the bottoms in
next week.

86
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,596
And after that, just a lifetime
of wearing retainers.

87
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,431
Well, they're
practically invisible.

88
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,801
I can't close my mouth.

89
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,170
The brackets are holding up
your lips at the edges.

90
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,438
They'll adjust.
The main thing is you're happy.

91
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,174
I'm not happy.

92
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,176
Have a little nitrous.

93
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,847
Oh, they should
revoke your license.

94
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:14,848
More, please.

95
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,850
- That's enough.
- No, it's not!

96
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,451
Yeah, give me that.

97
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,054
I thought your name is
Kidzrule.

98
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,390
Shortened from Kidzrulovitch,

99
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,526
which is Romanian for
kill all the children.

100
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,406
That elevator has the capacity
for 32 people!

101
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,275
We brought a rhino
up here last week.

102
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,849
My headaches are so bad.

103
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,390
Jealous?

104
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:01,695
Feet.

105
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,396
You're one in a million.

106
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,398
Literally.
Don't fall off the roof.

107
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,067
Homer Simpson!

108
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,936
The man who beat me
to planet Marge.

109
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,905
You've done all right
for a billionaire.

110
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,773
Hey, I'm not made of money.

111
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,542
Although, actually I am.

112
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,344
After my parole, I got rich

113
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,946
selling fireplace logs
that look like cash,

114
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,015
i.e., Money to Burn.

115
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,684
That is the greatest.

116
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,219
It says Money to Burn.

117
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:28,221
It looks like
you're burning money!

118
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:29,823
Yes, that's the idea.

119
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,258
No, no, no.

120
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,326
It's so funny.
Don't you get it?

121
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,428
Of course I get it.
I thought of it.

122
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:38,164
No, no, no.
Listen, it says Money to Burn,

123
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,400
but it's actually...

124
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,903
I know! I know!
Talk to someone else.

125
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,438
Hey, pal, you're a news guy.
Give it to me straight.

126
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,140
Is this wedding on the level?

127
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,242
Here's the scoop.
It's legit!

128
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:52,712
In other news, local newsman
hopes to score with caterer.

129
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,815
This just in,
she knows I'm married.

130
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,851
Coming up at 11:00
nothing.

131
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,953
Now, Homer,
as this is a bachelor party,

132
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,855
I want to show you something.

133
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,291
But no word to the wives.

134
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,459
How did you meet your wife,
by the way?

135
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:09,562
Boy meets girl,
girl meets bank account.

136
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,464
Now, shut your eyes.

137
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:14,167
You've never seen a body
this enticing.

138
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,836
Exactly what I imagined!

139
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,025
Food coma. He'll be fine.

140
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,684
Hey, girlfriend!

141
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,519
Who, me?

142
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,455
Lisa, did you get
your eyebrows waxed?

143
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,357
You look amazing!

144
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,025
I don't have eyebrows.

145
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,561
Well, check out
these twin caterpillars.

146
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,564
What's going on?

147
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,967
Her smile makes me feel full,

148
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,202
like I actually ate dinner
last night.

149
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,972
If you never eat,
how come you're so fat?

150
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,508
Americans can be fat and poor.

151
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,677
That's what makes us so great.

152
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:00,680
And so, after saving Wilbur,

153
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:03,183
Charlotte crawled off to die,

154
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:07,520
as all barn spiders do
in the fall.

155
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,358
Bravo, Lisa.

156
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,227
What a positive note
on which to end the class.

157
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,896
Positive? Positive?

158
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,800
Charlotte died alone
at the saddest place on Earth,

159
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,169
an empty fairground.

160
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:26,072
Well, your smiling face
made dying alone fun.

161
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,641
And believe me,
that's where I'm headed.

162
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,477
So as long as I'm smiling,

163
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,912
it doesn't matter
what comes out of my mouth?

164
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,414
Or your nose.

165
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,652
I don't need these anymore.

166
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,790
This'll go good
in Willie's stew.

167
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,728
Can it really be
that people are this shallow?

168
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:52,465
Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!

169
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,235
And am I shallow enough
to enjoy this?

170
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,137
I am!

171
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,307
I'm so happy, I could sing!

172
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,345
Hello, world!

173
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,982
That really hurts
with the braces.

174
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,985
- Take your pick.
- What is it?

175
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,320
No idea.
The labels are in Spanish.

176
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,862
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hey, Bart.

177
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,698
Lisa? Oh, yuck!
I didn't know that was you.

178
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,937
It's the smile. It's totally
changed how people see me.

179
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,873
Well, I just want you to know,
you'll always be gross to me.

180
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,875
Oh, thank God.
I was having doubts,

181
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,211
trying to figure out
if this is sexist.

182
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,313
And then I found this.

183
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,158
It seems like
ever since the pill,

184
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,994
the workplace has been
full of single women.

185
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,696
Here's your coffee, Jim.

186
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,666
Extra sugar,
just how you like it.

187
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,469
Remind me to get a divorce.

188
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,805
But some women are
having trouble fitting in.

189
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,807
Well, I can't
figure it out, Jim.

190
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:10,043
I was all prepared
for a big presentation,

191
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,879
but it went over
like a nun at a go-go bar.

192
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,814
Well, there's one thing
you didn't prepare,

193
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,216
and that's your face.

194
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,485
But I'm wearing a pound
of Mary Kay.

195
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,820
Let me touch your body
and show you the problem.

196
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,555
No need to ask.

197
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,425
You've got a secret weapon

198
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,427
sitting in the middle
of your face.

199
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,829
Now you're sure
to get that promotion.

200
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,564
Really?

201
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,866
No.

202
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,668
Don't you see
why I hate this?

203
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,337
'Cause you hate everything?

204
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,573
Because it makes
that jerky old guy right!

205
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,076
I am more popular
because I'm smiling.

206
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,511
Told ya!

207
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,689
Not a single picture
of Artie.

208
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,825
Maybe he has matured.

209
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:05,331
Well, I guess being here sort of
ends a chapter in my life.

210
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,800
So, lehayim.

211
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,436
That's odd.

212
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,473
Not one person
from the bride's family.

213
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,547
Excuse me. We need someone to
walk the bride down the aisle.

214
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:21,781
Could you?

215
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,350
First, tell me one thing.
How long is the aisle?

216
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,718
About 20 feet.

217
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,220
All right, I'll do it.

218
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,289
But double cake.

219
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,761
They grow up so fast.

220
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,497
I knew this day would come.

221
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:40,567
You'll always be
my little girl.

222
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,803
If he ever hurts my baby,
I'll kill him.

223
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,772
Oh, for crying out loud.

224
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,941
Friends, family,

225
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,943
I take great delight
in informing you

226
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,612
that the bride and groom
have written their own vows.

227
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,417
Stick to the script, amateurs!

228
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:02,689
Oh, my God.

229
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,190
This is too weird.

230
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:06,726
Artie, you are
the greatest lover ever.

231
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,629
When we make sex,
it is so, so good.

232
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:12,131
I can't take this anymore.
We're getting out of here.

233
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,567
Yeah. This is really creepy.

234
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:16,636
Even the rhino's leaving.

235
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,740
You may now kiss the bride.

236
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,647
And this is a picture of us
at our wedding.

237
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:28,982
You're so happy.

238
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,984
And here's us on our honeymoon.

239
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,152
Two days in Ohio,
two days in Michigan,

240
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:38,124
and, booyah, up to Ontario
for some international flavor.

241
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,827
I'm not happy.

242
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,730
I have a drawing of
you saying that in Michigan.

243
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,398
This smile is so wrong.

244
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,033
There's nothing
to be happy about.

245
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,069
The world is a mess,
and so is this school.

246
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,206
I mean, how hard is this?

247
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,276
The happy girl put the thing
in the hole!

248
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,081
Wait a minute.

249
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:05,518
I could use my new power
to change these things,

250
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,253
use it for good.

251
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,368
Indubitably.

252
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,837
Hear, hear! Hear, hear!

253
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,706
I can make it happen.

254
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,975
Hurry!

255
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,350
You posers.

256
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,552
I was for Lisa
before it was cool.

257
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,187
You never liked Lisa.

258
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,022
What?
You got to remember that.

259
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,891
That's my one thing!

260
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,894
No. Your thing is
crying when you're punched.

261
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,562
Prove it.

262
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,300
Aw, you're taking
all the fun out of it.

263
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,602
The polls are in,
and you're doing great.

264
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,014
You're picking up the key group,
girls who don't like Milhouse.

265
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,373
You're big with swing voters,

266
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,342
but the teeter-totters
could go either way.

267
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,876
What about the kids
on the slide?

268
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,144
Eh, they're up and down,

269
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,013
but the kids on the monkey bars
are climbing.

270
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,147
That's all I got.

271
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,416
Like every election
with one week to go,

272
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,051
this is in the bag.

273
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,353
Don't be so sure.

274
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,188
I'm up against a tough opponent.

275
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,156
Dubya Spuckler.

276
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,592
Look at this negative ad he did.

277
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:22,462
Lisa Simpson says writin'
ends with a G

278
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,964
and 'rithmetic
starts with a A.

279
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,033
You know what I say?

280
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,105
Don't worry.
You just keep smiling.

281
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,707
Well, I do have an orthodontist
appointment tomorrow

282
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:35,942
for a tune-up.

283
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,444
In the bag, Madam President.

284
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,213
Bup, don't be so sure.

285
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,116
Hey, I drew a picture
of your inauguration.

286
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,386
I don't think
I've ever looked more radiant.

287
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,826
Okay, kid.
Your bottom braces are on.

288
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,796
What happened to my smile?

289
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,432
No, no, no, this is terrible.

290
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,300
I look like I actually feel.

291
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,703
In six months,
you'll have perfect teeth.

292
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,539
Six months?
I have to smile now.

293
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,141
No, I can power through this.

294
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,213
Ralph lost his retainer
in the trash.

295
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,915
What can we do here?

296
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,217
New ones are $500.

297
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,720
So just what is
this secret mission, Chief?

298
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:23,556
Well, let's just say
you're on retainer.

299
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,702
- Let's see. I'll take this.
- Aw, stop that.

300
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,972
Aw, come on, Marge.
This minibar is paid for.

301
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,443
Do you know the street value
of this Toblerone?

302
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,178
Homer, stop it.

303
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,680
I can't help thinking about
that poor woman.

304
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:51,050
Artie only married her
because she looks like me.

305
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,819
I mean, a lot like me.

306
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,987
You're right. We have
to find her and tell her.

307
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,989
But, first,
there's something naughty

308
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,058
I want to do with this bed.

309
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,367
Are you sure we should be here?

310
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,169
This is
technically his honeymoon.

311
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,442
Artie?

312
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:19,045
I'm at the lowest point
of my life!

313
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,113
But come on in.

314
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,618
As a woman,
I just want to tell your wife

315
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,520
what's really going on here.

316
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,188
Sure, why not?

317
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:31,357
Say it to her face!

318
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:33,893
Now you know my secret.

319
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,362
I've spent years trying
to build the perfect copy

320
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,432
of the only woman for me,
you, Marge.

321
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:44,170
But they were all inferior
in some way.

322
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,506
This one lacks kindness.

323
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,341
This one keeps trying
to kill me.

324
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,176
This one's head is a toaster!

325
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,845
And the slots aren't even
big enough for a bagel!

326
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,382
Why would you marry a machine?

327
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,550
I didn't.

328
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,385
It was one last trick.

329
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,521
I thought when you saw
how perfect we look together,

330
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,190
you would realize
that we were meant to be.

331
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:08,628
I am, as the poet once said,
a dumb schmuck.

332
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,229
- Artie.
- Yes?

333
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:11,998
You're not dumb. You're smart.

334
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,833
And I think this crazy project

335
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,002
actually had
some brilliance in it.

336
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:19,572
Imagine if you use
that noodle for good.

337
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:26,379
Only you could find a pearl
in the flabby oyster that is me.

338
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,614
I will become
a better human being.

339
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:29,882
Terrific.

340
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,784
And then you'll love me?

341
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,119
No.

342
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:36,756
Well, then, I finally give up.

343
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,324
Or do I?

344
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,861
Aw, damn it.

345
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:46,165
Artie, you and your blue crew
of Margekateers

346
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,000
have done so many good deeds.

347
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,168
What's next?

348
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,237
I'm gonna make one of them
my bride.

349
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,140
Hey, I didn't give you wings.

350
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,042
Life finds a way!

351
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,289
Let's quiet down, please.

352
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,048
The sooner we can
get this debate over,

353
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,849
the sooner the teachers
can get ice cream.

354
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,687
None for Seymour.
He gets gassy.

355
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,221
Yeah, I know.

356
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,525
And now we have
a very special moderator,

357
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,628
Governor Mary Bailey.

358
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:18,331
Our first candidate is
Dubya Spuckler.

359
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,833
Dubya! Dubya!

360
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,001
That's your brother.

361
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,970
He prefers the pronoun they,

362
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:27,239
on account of the twin
he absorbed in my belly.

363
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,176
Our other candidate is ill,
so she'll be Skyping in.

364
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,744
Lisa Simpson.

365
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:34,180
Lisa, I'm sorry,
what do you have?

366
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,916
What I have is
an agenda for this school,

367
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,185
an agenda that looks forward.

368
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,921
I can deliver results,
while my opponent

369
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:44,357
can't even spell results.

370
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:47,326
Yes, I can.
R-E squiggly letter,

371
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,928
bucket letter, tall man,

372
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:50,696
little plus sign,
squiggly letter.

373
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,064
Results.

374
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,733
That's not how
you spell results.

375
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,569
Lisa doesn't sound sick at all.

376
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,473
You said
you've done this before.

377
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,075
It was my machismo talking.

378
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,518
Lisa's using a funny-face app.

379
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,992
Listen, I tried to fool you,
and that was wrong.

380
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,028
This is an abomination!

381
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,030
What are you doing
at a school debate?

382
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:27,667
My illegitimate son goes here.

383
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,835
Oh, the shame.

384
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,837
I still have good ideas.

385
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,407
All I hear is nag, nag, nag.

386
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,842
Dubya! Dubya!

387
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,545
Dubya! Dubya!

388
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:42,348
Oh, boy.

389
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,684
I didn't want to believe
my popularity was

390
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,819
based on my stupid smile.

391
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,088
Oh, but it was.

392
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,323
You're just a kid,
and things are changing.

393
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,426
In the future,
women will be judged

394
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,661
by what they say,
not how they look.

395
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:59,865
Maybe, but the future is
a really long way away.

396
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,301
Told you you should smile more.

397
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,804
The future is now!

398
00:20:11,111 --> 00:20:13,588
A toast. I have finally
perfected you.

399
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,415
You all look just like Marge,
and you will never leave.

400
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:20,519
Now, which of you lucky girls
wants to party with Arty?

401
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,157
I am in power save mode.

402
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,660
Oh, fine.
What about you two?

403
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:28,961
Power save.

404
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,330
One percent battery.

405
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,134
I just don't like you.

406
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,637
That counts as a kiss.
