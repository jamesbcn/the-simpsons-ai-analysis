Santa can't fit a pony
into his sleigh.

Can't you take a hint?

78
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,992

really good this year.

Dear. Maybe Bart is

- A tattoo?
- A what?

82
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,417
Yeah! They're cool,
and they last the rest of your life.

83

a tattoo for Christmas.

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,440
Good, because I do love you.

181
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,439
I don't deserve you as much
as a guy with a fat wallet

182
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,652
and a credit card that won't
set off that horrible beeping.

183
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,363
I think it does have
something to do with

184
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,953
your Christmas bonus.

185
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,948
I keep asking for it, but...

186
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,580
Marge, um,
let me be honest with you.

187
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,489
Yes?

188
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,618
Well, I would...

189
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,132
I wanna do the Christmas
shopping this year.

190
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,631
Sure, okay.

191
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,966
Marge, Marge.
Let's see.

192
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,314
Ooh, look!

193
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,560
Pantyhose.
Practical and alluring.

194
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:06,153
A six-pack.
Only 4.99.

195
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,440
Ooh! Pads of paper.

196
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,484
I bet Bart can think of

197
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,748
a million things to do
with these.

198
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,147
That just leaves little Maggie.

199
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,237
Look!

200
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,243
A little squeak toy.

201
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,325
It says it's for dogs,
but she can't read.

202
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,538
Simpson, it's you.

203
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,084
- Hello, Flanders.
- My!

204
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,037
What a little mess
we've got here.

205
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,547
Well, which ones are yours
and which ones are mine?

206
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,630
- Well, let's see...
- This one's mine. This one's mine.

207
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,546
- This one's mine, and this...
- They're all yours!

208
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,546
Hey, Mr. Simpson,
you dropped your pork chop.

209
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,015
Gimme that!

210
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,348
Well, happy holidays, Simpson.

211
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,814
Gee, Dad, this is gonna be
the best Christmas ever.

212
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,016
You bet.

213
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,908
What's the matter, Homer?

214
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,661
Somebody leave a lump of coal
in your stocking?

215
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,724
You've been sitting there,
sucking on a beer all day long.

216
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,416
- So?
- So, it's Christmas.

217
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:10,209
♪♪ -Thanks, Moe.

218
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,214
Drinks all around!

219
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,216
What's with
the crazy getup, Barn?

220
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,258
I got me a part-time job

221
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,722
working as a Santa
down at the mall.

222
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,723
Wow! Can I do that?

223
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,635
I don't know. They're pretty selective.

224
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,644
Do you like children?

225
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,096
What do you mean?

226
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,146
All the time?
Even when they're nuts?

227
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,650
I certainly do.

228
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,653
Welcome aboard, Simpson.

229
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,375
Pending your successful completion
of our training program, that is.

230
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,655
Ho ho ho.
Ho ho ho.

231
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,621
Ho ho ho.
Ho ho ho.

232
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,873
- What is it now, Simpson?
- When do we get paid?

233
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,666
Not a dime till Christmas Eve!

234
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,459
Now, from the top.

235
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,513
Ho ho ho.
Ho ho ho.

236
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,468
Um, Dasher.

237
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,800
Dancer.

238
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,345
Prancer.

239
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,350
Nixon.

240
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,812
Comet and... Cupid.

241
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,813
- Donna Dixon?
- Sit down, Simpson.

242
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,105
And what would you like,
little boy?

243
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,289
- You're not really Santa, tubby.
- Why, you little egghead!

244
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,686
No, no, Homer! If such
an emergency arises,

245
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,857
you just tell them Santa's
very busy this time of year,

246
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,907
and you are one of his helpers.

247
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,581
I knew that one too!

248
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,120
Homer, why are you
seven hours late?

249
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,786
Not a word, Marge.
I'm heading straight for the tub.

250
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,746
But, Homer, my sisters are here.

251
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,256
Don't you wanna say hello?

252
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,646
- Daddy! Daddy! We're so glad to see you!
- Dad, you're finally home!

253
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,927
What? Why?
Yeah.

254
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,684
Hello, Patty.
Hello, Selma.

255
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,807
- How was your trip?
- Fine.

256
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,354
- You both look well.
- Thank you.

257
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,688
Yeah, well, Merry Christmas.

258
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,613
It's Christmas?

259
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,571
- You wouldn't know it around here.
- And why is that?

260
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,282
Well, for one thing,
there's no tree.

261
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,742
Well, I was just on my way
out to get one!

262
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,533
- Can we go too, Dad?
- Yeah, can we?

263
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,827

Hey! Hey!

Come back here!

Beauty, isn't it?

- Wow! Yay, Dad!
- Way to go, Dad!

276
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,028
Why is there a birdhouse in it?

277
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,536
That's an ornament.

278
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,959
Do I smell gunpowder?

00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,868
And then I want some Robotoids.

And then I want a Goop Monster.

281
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,838
And then I want
a great big, giant...

282
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,090
Aw, son, you don't need
all that junk.

283
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,092
I'm sure you've already got something
much more important...

284
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,545
A decent home and
a loving father

285
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,926
who would do anything for you.

286
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,773
Hey, I couldn't afford lunch.
Give me a bite of that donut.

287
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,024
Get a load of that
quote-unquote Santa.

288
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,864
I can't believe those kids
are falling for it.

289
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,860
Hey, Milhouse, I dare you
to sit on his lap.

290
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,862
Yeah? Well, I dare you
to yank his beard off.

291
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,695
Touche.

292
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,700
I hope you feel better, Santa.

293
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,992
I will when
Mrs. Claus' sisters get outta town.

294
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,076
Thanks for listenin', kid.

295
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,083
Hey, Santa, what's shakin', man?

296
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,955
What's your name,
Bart... ner?

297
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,882
Little partner?

298
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,841
I'm Bart Simpson.
Who the hell are you?

299
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,131
I'm Jolly Old St. Nick.

300
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,884
Yeah?
We'll just see about that.

301
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,427
D'

302
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,641
- Homer!
- I want a word with you

303
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,272
in Santa's workshop, little boy.

304
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,518
Cover for me, Elfie.

305
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,730
Don't kill me, Dad.
I didn't know it was you.

306
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,900
Nobody knows.
It's a secret.

307
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,899
I didn't get my bonus this year.

308
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,041
But to keep the family
from missing out on Christmas,

309
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,986
- I'd do anything.
- I'll say, Dad.

310
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,568
You must really love us
to sink so low.

311
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,868
Now, let's not get mushy, son.

312
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,910
I still have a job to do.

313
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,954
Hey, little ones.
Santa's back.

314
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,788
Ho ho... D'

315
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,713
Damn it to...

316
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,922
Son, one day you're gonna know

317
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,923
the satisfaction of payday.

318
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,585
Receiving a big fat check
for a job well done.

319
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,335
Simpson, Homer?
Here ya go.

320
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,007
Come on, son.

321
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,885
Let's go cash this baby
and get presents for...

322
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:36,103
Thirteen bucks?
Hey, wait a minute.

323
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,095
That's right.
$120 gross.

324
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,147
Less Social Security,
less unemployment insurance,

325
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,899
- less Santa training...
- Santa training?

326
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,002
Less costume purchase,
less beard rental, less Christmas club.

327
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,146
- But... But...
- See ya next year.

328
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,566
Come on, Dad. Let's go home.

329
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,577
Thirteen bucks?

330
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,909
You can't get anything
for 13 bucks.

331
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,004
All right!
Thirteen big ones!

332
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,121
Springfield Downs, here I come!

333
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,208
- What?
- You heard me.

334
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,253
I'm goin' to the dog track.

335
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,667
I got a hot little puppy
in the fourth race.

336
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,676
- Wanna come?
- Sorry, Barney.

337
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,588
I may be a total washout
as a father,

338
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,047
but I'm not gonna take my kid

339
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,216
to a sleazy dog track
on Christmas Eve.

340
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,975
Come on, Simpson.
The dog's name is Whirlwind.

341
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,689
Ten-to-one shot.
Money in the bank.

342
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,690
Come on, Dad.

343
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,652
This can be the miracle that saves
the Simpsons' Christmas.

344
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,653
If TV has taught me anything,

345
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,695
it's that miracles always happen
to poor kids at Christmas.

346
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,120
It happened to Tiny Tim,

347
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,298
it happened to Charlie Brown,

348
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,624
it happened to the Smurfs,

349
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,331
and it's gonna happen to us.

350
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,366
Well, okay, let's go.
Who's Tiny Tim?

351
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,691
Hey, Moldy,
do you think Santa will be able to find

352
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,803
Elf County under all this snow?

353
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,551
I doubt it, Bubbles.

354
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,593
We'll be sad little elves
this Christmas.

355
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,888
- No!
- Brother.

356
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,972
- Where's your husband?
- Yeah. It's getting late.

357
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,437
Said he went caroling with Bart.

358
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:03,398
♪ We're in the money ♪

359
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,980
♪ We got a lot of what it takes
to get along ♪♪

360
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,187
I can't believe I'm doing this.

361
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,068
Can we open
our presents now, Dad?

362
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,156
You know the tradition, son.
Not till the eighth race.

363
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,122
Hey, Barney,
which one is Whirlwind?

364
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,542
Number Six.

365
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,460
That's our lucky dog
right over there.

366
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,210
He's won his last five races.

367
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,503
What? That scrawny little
bag of bones?

368
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,207
Come on, Dad. They're all
scrawny little bags of bones.

369
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,008
Yeah, you're right.

370
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,722
I guess Whirlwind
is our only hope

371
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,722
for a Merry Christmas.

372
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,534
Attention,
racing fans, we have a late scratch

373
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,596
in the fourth race.

374
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,522
Number 8, Sir Galahad

375
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,601
will be replaced by
Santa's Little Helper.

376
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,556
Once again, Sir Galahad

377
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,976
has been replaced by
Santa's Little Helper.

378
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,976
Bart, did you hear that?

379
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,068
What a name!
Santa's Little Helper!

380
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,453
It's a sign!
It's an omen!

381
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,659
It's a coincidence, Dad.

382
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,450
What are the odds
on Santa's Little Helper?

383
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,873
Ninety-nine to one.

384
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:01,121
Wow! Ninety-nine
times thirteen equals...

385
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,575
Merry Christmas!

386
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,575
I got a bad feeling about this.

387
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,587
Don't you believe in me, son?

388
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,249
Come on, boy.
Sometimes your faith

389
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,628
is all that keeps me going.

390
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,635
Go for it, Dad.

391
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,259
That's my boy!

392
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,466
Everything on
Santa's Little Helper.

393
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,096
Three cheers for Brainy!

394
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,524
- Hip hip hooray!
- Yay!

395
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,523
Unadulterated pap.

396
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,065
- It's almost 9:00.
- Where's Homer anyway?

397
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:32,069
It's so typical of the big doofus
to spoil it all.

398
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,452
- What, Aunt Patty?
- Nothing, dear.

399
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,490
I'm just trashing your father.

400
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,493
Well, I wish you wouldn't

401
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,535
because aside from the fact that

402
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,119
he has the same frailties
as all human beings,

403
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,115
he's the only father I have.

404
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,707
Therefore, he is
my model of manhood,

405
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,553
and my estimation of him

406
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,208
will govern the prospects
of my adult relationships.

407
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,677
So I hope you bear in mind

408
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,548
that any knock at him
is a knock at me,

409
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,095
and I'm far too young

410
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,388
to defend myself
against such onslaughts.

411
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,733
Go watch
your cartoon show, dear.

412
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,730
Come on, Bart.

413
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,312
Kiss the ticket for good luck,

414
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,937
not that we need it.

415
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,195
Here comes Screwy
the mechanical rabbit.

416
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,409
And they're off!

417
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,329
- Come on, Santa's Little Helper!
- Come on, dog! Go, man, go!

418
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,329
It's Whirlwind in the lead,
and coming up on the left is Quadruped,

419
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,412
followed by Dog O'War and Fido.

420
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,377
- Go! Come on, boy!
- Go, Santa's Little Helper!

421
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,627
Come on, get that rabbit!

422
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,209
Dog O'War coming up fast
on the outside.

423
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,395
- Come on, Santa's Little Helper!
- Come on, dog! Go, man, go!

424
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,552
And with a lock on last place,

425
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,012
it's Santa's Little Helper.

426
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,432
Don't worry, Dad.

427
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,772
Maybe this is just for suspense
before the miracle happens.

428
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,269
- Come on, you stupid dog! Come on, boy!
- Go, go!

429
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,522
- Run! Run!
- Run! Come on, get that rabbit!

430
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,265
Go, go, Santa's Little Helper!
Go, go, go!

431
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,147
Whirlwind by a country mile,

432
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,574
and in second, Chew My Shoe,
followed by Dog O'War.

433
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,283
Jeez!

434
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,454
Doesn't seem possible,
but I guess TV has betrayed me.

435
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,374
I don't wanna leave
till our dog finishes.

436
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,462
Forget it.
Let's go.

437
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,306
- Find any winners, son?
- Sorry, Dad.

438
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,389
Hey, hey, Simpson!
What'd I tell you?

439
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,476
Whirlwind!
Let's go, Daria.

440
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,319
Beat it! Scram!
Get lost!

441
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,413
You came in last for the last time!

442
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,580
Look, Dad, it's Santa's Little Helper.

443
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,499
And don't come back!

444
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,458
No, you don't! No, no!
Get away from me!

445
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,836
Can we keep him, Dad, please?

446
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,380
But he's a loser!
He's pathetic! He's...

447
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,427
A Simpson.

448
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,429
Maybe I should call the police.

449
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,477
- He'll sober up.
- Yeah. Come staggering home.

450
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,771
Smelling of cheap perfume.

451
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,275
Homer!

452
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,738
-What? What the...
Who the... -Look, everybody,

453
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,409
- I have a confession to make.
- This should be good.

454
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,199
I didn't get my Christmas bonus.

455
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,704
I tried not to let it ruin Christmas for
everybody,

456
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,706
but no matter what I did...

457
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,208
Hey, everybody,
look what we got!

458
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,422
A dog!
All right, Dad!

459
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,013
God bless him.

460
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,418
So love at first sight
is possible.

461
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,837
And if he runs away,
he'll be easy to catch.

462
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,346
This is the best gift
of all, Homer!

463
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,849
- It is?
- Yes. Something to share our love

464
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,851
and frighten prowlers.

465
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,393
- What's his name?
- Number 8...

466
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,937
