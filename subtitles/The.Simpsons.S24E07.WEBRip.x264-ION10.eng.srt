{\an8}You might fall.

00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:18,136
{\an8}Oh, he's such a cute little rascal.

00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,489

00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,124
{\an8}Should I call an ambulance?

19
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,075
{\an8}Help! An old man is dying!

20
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,326
{\an8}Oh! This boy's grandfather

21
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,298
{\an8}is a shriveled-up corncob
begging for death!

22

{\an8}I am his father!

{\an8}I'm not old enough to have food for you!

{\an8}This drawing doesn't think I'm old.

{\an8}Don't you, drawing?

33
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,197
{\an8}(gasps) Those aren't our regular donuts.

34
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,659
{\an8}They're huge! With crazy toppings!

35
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,950
{\an8}HOMER: Gummy worms! Churro chunks!

36
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,504
{\an8}Russian nesting donut!

{\an8}(yelps) They're gone!

39
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,091
{\an8}Where did these Devil Donuts come from?

40
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,800
{\an8}I don't know. The guy who gives

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,550
{\an8}the sexual harassment
seminars brought them in.

42
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,592
{\an8}Actually, Carl, there's no
workplace-appropriate use

43
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,426
{\an8}for the word "bazooms."

44
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,012
{\an8}What about "thunderbags"?

45
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,717
{\an8}Get lost, pervs!

46
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,941
{\an8}Okay, where did you get these donuts?!

47
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,439
{\an8}From a guy with a cart.
It could be anywhere!

48
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,275
{\an8}<i>WIGGUM: 911. What is your emergency?</i>

49
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,779
{\an8}I'm calling to report
a missing donut cart.

50
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,782
{\an8}(siren wailing)

51
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,454
{\an8}I'm not seeing anything.
Can you get any lower?

52
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,954
{\an8}But, Chief, the power lines!

53
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:02,115
{\an8}(mocking) "But, Chief, the power lines."
Go lower!

54
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,455
{\an8}HOMER: Nope. Nope. Nothing.

55
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,631
{\an8}Nope.

56
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,248
{\an8}I see...

57
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,545
{\an8}devil horns...

58
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,258
{\an8}pitchfork... pointed tail,

59
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,418
{\an8}hooves are... cloven!

60
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,757
{\an8}We have logo, people! We have logo!

61
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,758
{\an8}Sorry, gents, we're fresh out.

62
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,307
{\an8}I only make one batch a day.
When they're gone, I'm done.

63
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,481
{\an8}Oh, no more donuts?!

64
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,690
{\an8}Make more or I shoot!

65
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,189
{\an8}I'm not bluffing. Come on.

66
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,772
{\an8}Hmm.

67
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,437
{\an8}What have I become?

68
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,435
{\an8}It's not a good feeling

69
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,067
{\an8}when you're saying,
"what have I become?"

70
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,864
{\an8}more than once a day.

71
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:36,867
{\an8}Mm. Mm-hmm.

72
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,657
{\an8}Tell you what, I could give you

73
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,503
{\an8}a sneak preview of a new donut

74
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,709
{\an8}that's still in the R&D phase.

75
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,879
{\an8}Oh. Beer keg donut?!

76
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,289
{\an8}(slurps)

77
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,086
{\an8}I would be honored

78
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,922
{\an8}to shake the hand that glazed this.

79
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,337
{\an8}I'm Terence.

80
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,505
{\an8}Tell me everything about you.

81
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,104
{\an8}You're from Portland?

82
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,349
{\an8}I've heard of people being from there.

83
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,641
{\an8}<i>No, I haven't.</i>

84
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,644
{\an8}Yeah, but Portland
just got too played out.

85
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,346
{\an8}The city used to be real.

86
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,896
{\an8}Do you know there are
now restaurants there

87
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,109
{\an8}with two locations? (chuckles)

88
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,690
{\an8}Not near my kids.

89
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,784
{\an8}Wait a minute. You have kids?

90
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,110
{\an8}You can't have kids. Look at you.

91
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,356
{\an8}You have a fun job, a skull ring--

92
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,908
{\an8}and it's not Halloween--

93
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,781
{\an8}and your belt is a seat belt!

94
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,288
{\an8}No one would ever think
you're a lame old man.

95
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,290
Ah, you can't let being
a dad slow you down.

96
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,293
Me and the fam are doing
the whole "urban nomad" thing.

97
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,206
You know, just looking for an
undiscovered city with affordable houses.

98
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,166
(gasps) Our houses are the cheapest!

99
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,296
The one next to me's
been on sale forever!

100
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,933
I see them lowering
the price every morning

101
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,141
when I go out to pee.

102
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,352
Please. Please rush into this.

103
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,812
Please rush into this.

104
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,352
What a find!

105
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,305
Underneath all the ugly renovations

106
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,975
this house has Neutra bones.

107
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,154
In my house, we found human bones.

108
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,943
Emily and I have always dreamed

109
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,856
of restoring
an architectural masterpiece.

110
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,155
I have a graduate degree
in Mid-Century Kitsch.

111
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,160
Thanks for turning us on
to this place, Homer.

112
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,242
You're a pretty cool guy.

113
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,366
Really? I'm... (gasps) cool?!

114
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,174
Oh, can I man-hug you?

115
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,749
Sure.

116
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,343
(grunts) I don't know how!

117
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:19,375
Okay, our first hangout
with the cool new neighbors.

118
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,387
I've already blown them away--

119
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,259
their words, I assume--
so don't screw it up!

120
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,097
Oh, relax, kids. Just be yourselves.

121
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:30,693
Oh, great, Marge,
now that's in their heads!

122
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,688
Hey, this is my armadillo, Chuy.

123
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,483
Uh, Mexico Chuy, not <i>Star Wars</i> Chewie.

124
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,397
<i>Star Wars</i> Chewie is
just a man in a costume,

125
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,157
so he's not scary.

126
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,333
-And this is our baby, Corduroy...
-(squeals)

127
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,370
...and our son, T-Rex.

128
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,503
Yeah, neighbors. Heh, I get it.

129
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,000
T-Rex? Even their names are cool.

130
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,633
Uh, this is, um...

131
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,840
Ice Cream, Bungee Jump,
and... Viral Video.

132
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:58,762
(growls)

133
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,005
-Wow!
-Whoa!

134
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,343
BART: Cool.

135
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,678
Look at these obscure card games!

136
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,773
Hey, do you have Uno?

137
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,439
I did, when I was uno.

138
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,438
Check out all these
Sergeant Activity dolls!

139
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,440
No, that's Combat Jack,

140
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,482
the original British doll

141
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,936
that Sergeant Activity ripped off.

142
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,607
Fine. You have a weird
old version of something.

143
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,026
Let's just watch TV.

144
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:27,124
Uh, TV? We don't own a TV.

145
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,661
I didn't know that was an option.

146
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,036
I think I'm done here.

147
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,622
Lisa, go nuts.

148
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,497
My dad only lets me watch
what's on his queue.

149
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,545
<i>(classical music playing)</i>

150
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,378
<i>If I don't get off the Cloud Palace,</i>

151
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,884
<i>I'll never get home for school tomorrow,</i>

152
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,545
<i>but the Toad Spirit has Aunt Ginzee!</i>

153
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,804
(gasps)

154
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,926
(humming nervously)

155
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,064
"Scientists prove cat heaven real,

156
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,484
human heaven not!"

157
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,522
(gasps) That's so sad!

158
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,857
Those are joke headlines.

159
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,941
It's not a real newspaper,

160
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,647
it's just satire.

161
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,407
Oh... satire!

162
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,203
And these fake movie reviews
are so mean,

163
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,746
it's hilarious! (laughs)

164
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,960
Oh, those are real.

165
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,041
Great paper.

166
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,417
Maggie's a little hungry.

167
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,344
Oh, you can go ahead and feed her.

168
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,222
Corduroy could probably use a snack.

169
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,550
(suckling)

170
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,215
Hmm, that's not applesauce.

171
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,265
Oh, uh,
you don't have to be uncomfortable

172
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,309
around another nursing mom.

173
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,813
Breast-feeding's
just a healthy thing we all do.

174
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,555
It sure is!

175
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,277
There's nothing more natural
than... that.

176
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,069
It's just that Maggie's already...

177
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:46,742
milked me today. (nervous laugh)

178
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,323
Homer, I think we should go.

179
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,908
We're not like these people. (gasps)

180
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,913
Check out my new look.
Terence shaved my head.

181
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,666
You're all bald!

182
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,748
No, I'm young-person cool bald!

183
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,835
Not old-person sad bald.

184
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,090
I never want to see these again!

185
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,052
(groans)

186
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,015
Check it out, Flanders!

187
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,139
Us cool dads are sharing a mono-yard!

188
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,557
Guess I can't be
your best friend anymore.

189
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,316
(chuckles) To be honest, that comes
as a tremendous relief.

190
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,729
Boo-hoo-hoo! You could cry all night,

191
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,488
it's not gonna win me back!

192
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,824
(gate creaks)

193
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,537
(gasps) I can finally compost!

194
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,038
(Lisa humming happily)

195
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,331
Maybe we shouldn't rush things
with the new neighbors.

196
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,706
You know, we might not
all be a perfect match.

197
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,554
I have a plan to deal with that.

198
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,759
Step one: Change everything
about ourselves

199
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,550
until we are super-cool. The end.

200
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,303
But I always thought you were cool.

201
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,386
Honey, I'm not cool. I was never cool.

202
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,893
I didn't go to college.

203
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,564
Every CD I have, I bought at a car wash.

204
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,403
Black-and-white films make me angry.

205
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,559
I can't pronounce "artisanal."

206
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,187
I only know David Cross
from the Chipmunks movie.

207
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,185
Not only do I like Van Halen,

208
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,147
but I think they keep getting better.

209
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,317
Oh...

210
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,945
But if me and my kids do
the same stuff as Terence and his kids,

211
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,914
I could be a cool dad.

212
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,955
Well, sweetie,
if it's that important to you,

213
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,380
I guess we can try.

214
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,959
Thanks, baby. Here, have a bracelet

215
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,505
made of a '70s educational film strip.

216
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,009
Ooh, hygiene!

217
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,261
{\an8}<i>♪ Yeah, it's a real cool club</i>
<i>and you're not part of it ♪</i>

218
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,734
{\an8}<i>♪ Yeah, it's a real cool club</i>
<i>and you'll never be a part of it ♪</i>

219
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,359
MARGE: Your father took you
to a Korean gangster film festival?

220
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,359
Yeah, it was great!
This one guy was part

221
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,031
of another guy's gang--
I mean, kkangpae--

222
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,030
but then he quit and
joined another kkangpae,

223
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,612
and when the guys in
the first kkangpae found out,

224
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,777
they were so mad they put
his feet in a blender!

225
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,366
Then they cut to a guy eating noodles,
and blood splashed on him!

226
00:08:56,452 --> 00:09:00,462
At the art walk, we walked into
a gallery, and it was just a guy crying.

227
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,460
That was the art!

228
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,462
(growls)
The kids are a mess!

229
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,455
You brought them home
exhausted and pretentious!

230
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,008
No, we need to take kids
to grown-up stuff.

231
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,892
That's Terence's parenting style.

232
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,430
Parenting shouldn't have a style!

233
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,394
Parenting is about bedtimes,

234
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,484
and passwords on computers,

235
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,400
and complicated punishments

236
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,108
you never follow through on!

237
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,688
Are you wearing a wallet chain?

238
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,194
You look like... a barista!

239
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,397
Well, you won't be laughing when you see

240
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,407
how many pickpockets this thing catches.

241
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,989
And what's with the scarf?
It's soaked in neck sweat!

242
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:41,036
Wearing scarves in non-scarf weather
is the essence of cool.

243
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,752
The essence!

244
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,042
Ooh.

245
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,384
Aw, man, my goatee has barely come in!

246
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,303
Why does my hair only grow in twos?

247
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,223
Oh, I hope T-Rex likes
the present I made him.

248
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,143
Made? Why didn't you just buy him a toy?

249
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,432
(sighs) Homemade presents
are how cool families

250
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,977
demonstrate how awesome they are.

251
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:07,061
If I show up with a toy...

252
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,108
from the store...

253
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,651
like we would give our kids...

254
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,486
then I've failed!

255
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:17,741
And these skinny jeans will have
flattened my junk for nothing!

256
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,115
(rock playing)

257
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:27,501
Geez, is this a kid's birthday party,
or the place a bad guy

258
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,125
kidnaps you to in a movie?

259
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,841
Yeah, this factory
used to make blimp tires.

260
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:35,182
T-Rex loves decaying industrial-scapes.

261
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:38,969
I used to. Now I'm into
abandoned ethnic union halls.

262
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,055
Come on, dude, this party rocks!

263
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,100
Love the temporary tattoo station!

264
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,444
(chuckles) Uh, temporary?

265
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,099
I want kitty whiskers!

266
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,938
You got it.

267
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:52,533
There's got to be a bounce house
around here somewhere.

268
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,200
At least maybe a piñata?

269
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,700
(loud suckling)

270
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,084
Holy aureole!

271
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,161
Please, join our milk circle.

272
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:07,876
I'd love to, but Maggie's a little shy.

273
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,548
Oh, don't worry--
you can use a nursing apron.

274
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,549
Play along.

275
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,551
Oh, this couldn't feel more natural.

276
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,344
Glug, glug, glug.

277
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,967
That's a good little mammal.

278
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,641
-(all gasp)
-A bottle?!

279
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,975
-Plastic!
-Formula!

280
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,731
That is so wrong.

281
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,573
Fine, I admit it, you nipple Nazis.

282
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,570
I give my baby formula.

283
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,072
(all gasping)

284
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,323
It's okay. If you don't
want to breast-feed

285
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,906
your baby, we will.

286
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,413
-Stay back.
-(woman gasp)

287
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,115
You know I'll use this.
Because you saw me using it.

288
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,076
(women whimpering)

289
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,916
Huh, 1950s Pontiac Accordion Camera.

290
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,343
I could always use another one of these.

291
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,594
Bowling shoes.

292
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,046
Not vintage, but you know, in a pinch.

293
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,595
"Dino-Cool"

294
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,603
Oh, I get it-- a T-Rex for the T-Rex.

295
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,557
How long did it take him
to think of that one?

296
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,187
-(boys laughing)
-Oh, man.

297
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,614
Hey, my dad worked
really hard to make that.

298
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,863
He took a class to learn denim painting.

299
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,445
(sighs) This is so pathetic.

300
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,620
I can't even wear it
ironically ironically.

301
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,121
This guy's going on my "Poseur Tumblr."

302
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,253
(grunting to music)

303
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,580
(boys laughing)

304
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,916
No one bad-mouths my dad except me.

305
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,803
(both grunting)

306
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,800
Hey, dude!

307
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,262
♪♪

308
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,509
My vinyl. My vinyl!

309
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,596
(boys grunting, Marge gasping)

310
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,182
Your son attacked mine.

311
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,017
You've turned this former slaughterhouse

312
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,652
into a place of violence.

313
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,229
I thought it made blimp tires.

314
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,824
Yeah,
like factories are never repurposed.

315
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,490
(yells)

316
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,738
It's time for you guys to leave.

317
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,910
Are we still on for midnight bike riding?

318
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,619
(whimpers)

319
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,407
(bell rings)

320
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:14,208
Feeling included is life's greatest joy.

321
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,173
HOMER: Oh...

322
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,430
(laughing) Oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh-ho-ho, boy.

323
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,431
Oh-ho-ho, boy, oh, boy.

324
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,684
Have you been "oh boy"-ing all night?

325
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,846
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho, boy.

326
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,806
We had the family version
of a bromance going

327
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,107
with our awesome neighbors
and you had to screw it up.

328
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,032
Look, that kid threw your
present in the garbage,

329
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,360
and he called you a poseur,
and everyone laughed.

330
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,696
He called me a poseur?

331
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,372
Yeah, I was sticking up for you.

332
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,870
You? Sticking up for your old man?

333
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,043
You've never done that before.

334
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,251
Also, I didn't want to tell you,

335
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,042
but that wife and her
gang looked down on me

336
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,876
because I don't breast-feed.

337
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,302
What?
No one judges my wife's thunderbags.

338
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,262
Well, maybe I was wrong
about these people.

339
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,223
Whoever thought a cool person
could be a jerk?

340
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,637
(grunts) They can "goatee" hell.

341
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,635
Humph.

342
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,685
Yeah, that's right.

343
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,272
The friendship between the Simpsons

344
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,737
and the whatever-your-
last-name-is-es-es is over.

345
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,489
I want my moustache stencils back.

346
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,662
Fine. Keep 'em.

347
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,617
But you have to give back... Lisa?

348

Let me tell you
"cool parents" something.

362
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,945
Parents are supposed to be lame
so their kids have something

cool just long enough

364

for whom they are lame.
