1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,087
Hello once again.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,298
As usual, I must warn you all
that this year's Halloween show

3
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,384
is very, very scary,

4
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:11,011
and those of you
with young children

5
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,513
may want to send them
off to bed...

6
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:17,100
Oh, my. It seems
the show is so scary

7
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,352
that congress
won't even let us show it.

8
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,895
Instead, they've suggested

9
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,231
the 1947 classic
Glenn Ford movie

10
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,275
"200 Miles to Oregon."

11
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,700
There's nothing wrong
with your television set.

12
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,161
Do not attempt
to adjust your picture.

13
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,413
We are controlling
the transmission.

14
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,331
What's that, boy?
We're in control?

15
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:44,210
Hey, look...
I can see my voice.

16
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,506
Blub, blub, blub,
blub, blub.

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:54,220
This... is my voice...
on TV.

18
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,139
Dad! You're ruining
the mood.

19
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,223
Sorry.

20
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,516
For the next half hour,

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,227
we will control
what you see and hear.

22
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,647
You are about to experience
the terror and foul horror

23
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:08,109
of The Simpsons'
Halloween Special.

24
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,625
Well, it was a long trip,
but we're almost there.

25
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,727
Homer, did you
remember to lock

26
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,670
the front door
of the house?

27
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,633
Well, it's been two long trips

28
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,552
but we're finally
almost there again.

29
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,053
When you locked
the front door,

30
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,364
did you remember to lock
the back door?

31
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,388
D'oh! D'oh!

32
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,477
Oh, no!

33
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,980
We left Grampa
back at the gas station.

34
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,441
What about Grampa?

35
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,740
- Hi. We're here.
- We made it.

36
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,577
Oh, goody. The sea monkeys
I ordered have arrived.

37
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,620
Look at them
cavort and caper.

38
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,582
Sir, they're the new
winter caretakers for the lodge.

39
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,961
Yes, they work hard
and they play hard.

40
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:52,964
This house has quite a long
and colorful history.

41
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:56,634
It was built on an ancient
Indian burial ground

42
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:00,430
and was the setting of
satanic rituals, witch-burnings

43
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,016
and five John Denver
Christmas specials.

44
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,518
Oh... John Denver.

45
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,942
Hmm... that's odd.

46
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,152
Usually the blood

47
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,528
gets off at
the second floor.

48
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,662
Hey, I found a shortcut
through your hedge maze.

49
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,372
Why, you little...

50
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,124
No, go easy on
the wee one.

51
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,335
His father's gonna go crazy

52
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,836
and chop them all
into haggis.

53
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,837
What's haggis?

54
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,423
Boy, you read my thoughts.

55
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,008
You've got the shinning.

56
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,301
You mean "shining."

57
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,053
Shh! You want to get sued?

58
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,139
Now look, boy,
if your Dad goes gaga,

59
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:48,102
you just use that shin
of yours to call me

60
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,021
and I'll come a-running.

61
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,941
But don't be reading my mind
between 4:00 and 5:00.

62
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,024
That's Willie's time.

63
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,782
Yes, by cutting off cable TV
and the beer supply,

64
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:04,661
I can ensure an honest winter's
work out of those lowlifes.

65
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,498
Sir, did you ever stop to think
that maybe it was doing this

66
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,850
that caused the previous
caretakers to go insane

67
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:10,792
and murder their families?

68
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,961
Hmm. Perhaps.
Tell you what:

69
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,521
We come back and everyone's
slaughtered,

70
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,256
I owe you a Coke.

71
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,098
Hmm... cable's out.

72
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,267
Think I'll have a beer.

73
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,602
Not a drop in the house.

74
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,687
What do you know?

75
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,021
Homer, I'm impressed.

76
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,606
You're taking this quite well.

77
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,608
I'll kill you!
I'll kill all of you!

78
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,277
- Homer!
- Sorry, sorry.

79
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,945
Don't worry.

80
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,698
There's plenty I can do
to keep myself occupied.

81
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,033
Maybe I'll check out
that ax collection.

82
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,035
See you later.

83
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,037
Mom, is Dad going to kill us?

84
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,998
We're just gonna have
to wait and see.

85
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,712
So, what will it be, Homer?

86
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,046
Moe! Give me a beer.

87
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,048
No, not unless you
kill your family.

88
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,800
Why should I
kill my family?

89
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,677
Uh... they'd be much
happier as ghosts.

90
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,053
You don't look so happy.

91
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,763
Oh I'm happy!
I'm very happy.

92
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,348
La-la-la-la-la. See?

93
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,434
Now waste your family.
I'll give you a beer.

94
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,144
Homer?

95
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,895
Homey?

96
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,691
Hmm... what he's typed will be
a window into his madness.

97
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,364
"Feelin' fine."

98
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,824
Wow, that's a relief.

99
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,702
Oooooh...

100
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,630
Hmm... this is
less encouraging.

101
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,798
Hello!

102
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,927
So, what do you think, Marge?

103
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,555
All I need is a title.

104
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,640
I was thinking along the lines

105
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:54,187
of "no TV and no beer make
Homer something something."

106
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,813
Go crazy?

107
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,565
Don't mind if I do.

108
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,118
Stay away from me, Homer.

109
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,370
Give me the bat, Marge.

110
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,413
Give me the bat.
Give me the bat.

111
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,166
Come on, give me the bat.
Give me the bat-bat-boo!

112
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,378
Scaredy-cat.

113
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,096
You stay here
till you're no longer insane.

114
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,640
Hmm, chili
would be good tonight.

115
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,311
Homer, it's Moe.

116
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,606
Look, some of the ghouls and I
are a little concerned

117
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,733
the project isn't
moving forward.

118
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,151
Can't murder now... eating.

119
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,404
Aw, for crying out loud,
come on.

120
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,863
No!

121
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,329
Here's Johnny!

122
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,334
David Letterman!

123
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,086
Hi, David.
I'm Grampa.

124
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,381
I'm Mike Wallace,
I'm Morley Safer

125
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,841
and I'm Ed Bradley.

126
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,468
All this and Andy Rooney
tonight on "60 Minutes."

127
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,891
Hello, police?
This is Marge Simpson.

128
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,352
My husband is on
a murderous rampage. Over.

129
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,396
Oh. Well,
thank God that's over.

130
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,523
I was worried
there for a second.

131
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,649
No answer.

132
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,067
Don't worry, Mom.

133
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,446
I can use my... shinning
to call Willie.

134
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:32,243
And that was the first time
she'd ever flown a plane.

135
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,163
Uh-oh. The little fat boy
and his family are in trouble.

136
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,166
I'm coming to rescue
the lot of you.

137
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:42,170
All right, loony,
show me what you got.

138
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,465
Is that the best
you can do?

139
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:49,177
Oh, my, I hope that rug
was Scotchgarded.

140
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,181
Must kill family.

141
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,488
The troops
had been given rifles

142
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,531
but no ammunition.

143
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,782
Dad, look!

144
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,451
Television!

145
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,995
Teacher, mother, secret lover.

146
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:19,499
Urge to kill fading...

147
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,792
fading... fading.

148
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,128
Rising. Fading.

149
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,379
Fading.

150
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,256
Gone.

151
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,761
Come, family.

152
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,097
Sit in the snow with Daddy
and let us all bask

153
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:40,228
in television's warm,
glowing, warming glow.

154
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,438
Live from Broadway

155
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,273
it's the Tony Awards

156
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,860
with your hosts
Tyne Daly and Hal Linden.

157
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:48,944
Homer, change channel.

158
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,863
Can't... frozen.

159
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,491
- One...
- Ah!

160
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,951
Chorus line of people.

161
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,037
Urge to kill rising.

162
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,503
You know, Marge,
I've had my share of troubles,

163
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:09,465
but sitting here now with you
and the kids in our cozy home

164
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,425
in this beautiful,
free country,

165
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,346
it just makes me feel
that I'm really a lucky guy.

166
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,516
Dad! Your hand is jammed
in the toaster!

167
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,314
Get it off!
Get it off!

168
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,149
Get this off of me!

169
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,028
Whew-hoo!

170
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,488
Dad! It's in there again!

171
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,872
This shouldn't be
too hard to fix

172
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,791
with the right tools.

173
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,339
There.

174
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,009
Better than new.

175
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,553
Now to take her
for a test toast.

176
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,763
What the...

177
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,816
Look at that. I'm the first
non-Brazilian person

178
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,735
to travel backwards
through time.

179
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,195
Correction, Homer.
You're the second.

180
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,864
That's right,
Mr. Peabody.

181
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,032
Quiet, you.

182
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,748
I've gone back to the time

183
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:27,043
when dinosaurs weren't
just confined to zoos.

184
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,254
Okay, don't panic.

185
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,966
Remember the advice your father
gave you on your wedding day.

186
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,762
If you ever travel back in time,
don't step on anything

187
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,097
because even the tiniest change

188
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:44,185
can alter the future
in ways you can't imagine.

189
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:47,063
Fine. As long as I
stand perfectly still

190
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:51,025
and don't touch anything,
I won't destroy the future.

191
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,444
Stupid bug!
You go squish now.

192
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,366
But that was just one little
insignificant mosquito.

193
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,284
That can't change
the future, right?

194
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,869
Right?

195
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,961
Phew! I'm back.

196
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,759
Aw, my loving family.

197
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,552
Nothing's changed.

198
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,475
Hidely-ho, slaverinos.

199
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,435
Okely-dokely.

200
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,730
Hey, what the hell is that
geek Flanders doing on TV?

201
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,983
Oh, I see by the big board

202
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,653
we got a negative Nellie
in sector two.

203
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,905
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
ask the whole family

204
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,783
to kinda freeze and
prepare for re-neducation.

205
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,410
Don't you remember, Dad?

206
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,787
Flanders is the unquestioned
lord and master of the world.

207
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,053
Okay, everybody,
let's see some big smiles.

208
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:07,059
Just relax and let
the hooks do their work.

209
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,687
What the hell
are you smiling at?

210
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,733
Now, in case all that smiling
didn't cheer you up

211
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,818
there's one thing
that never fails...

212
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,278
A nice glass of warm milk,

213
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,613
a little nap and
a total frontal lobotomy.

214
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,782
It's not so bad, Homer.

215
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,034
They go in through your nose

216
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,620
and they let you keep

217
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,205
the piece of brain
they cut out.

218
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,667
Look. Whoo, hello.
Hello there.

219
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,669
Who's that big man there?

220
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,670
Who's that?

221
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,631
Join us, Father.

222
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:42,136
It's bliss.

223
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,512
No!

224
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,771
Oh, no, they're gaining on me.

225
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,272
Wait! I have an idea.

226
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,899
These wieners will give me

227
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,302
the quick energy
I need to escape.

228
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,822
I got to go back.

229
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,240
Fix future.

230
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,580
This time I'm not gonna
touch a thing.

231
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,835
Ooh! Ooh! Mustn't crush,
mustn't kill.

232
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,837
Made it.

233
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:21,300
Oh, I wish, I wish
I hadn't killed that fish.

234
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,768
Hey, where is everybody?

235
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,606
Hey, there's a bug
that looks like Dad.

236
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,607
Let's kill it.

237
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,900
Okay.

238
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,077
Ah-choo!

239
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,463
This is gonna cost me.

240
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,429
I mean, hey...

241
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,182
Good morning, Father dear.
Hope you're well.

242
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,517
Are we taking the new Lexus

243
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,519
to Aunt Patty and Selma's
funeral today?

244
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,688
Hmm, fabulous house,
well-behaved kids.

245
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,940
Sisters-in-law dead,
luxury sedan...

246
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,442
Whoo-hoo! I hit the jackpot!

247
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,405
Marge dear, would you
kindly pass me a doughnut?

248
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,490
Doughnut? What's a doughnut?

249
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,539
Hmm, it's raining again.

250
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,378
You're still not
in your own world, Homer.

251
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:43,299
I can get you home,
but you have to do exactly as...

252
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,010
This is indeed

253
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,554
a disturbing universe.

254
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,556
Don't touch anything?!

255
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,017
I'll touch whatever I feel like!

256
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,238
Foolish Earthling.

257
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,740
Totally unprepared
for the effects

258
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:08,991
of time travel.

259
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,589
What happened to us,
Kodos?

260
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,757
Quiet, you.

261
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,725
Good morning, dear.

262
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,119
What's my name?
What color is the sky?

263
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,395
What of doughnuts? What?!

264
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,023
For the love
of God, tell me!

265
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,524
Homer, the sky is blue.

266
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,151
Doughnuts are plentiful.

267
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,028
Friday is
T.G.I.F. night on ABC.

268
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,655
What's gotten into you?

269
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,781
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

270
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:49,864
Let's just eat.

271
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,749
Ah, close enough.

272
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,802
Hey, everybody.

273
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,637
Let's all turn
our desks backwards

274
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,639
before Mrs. Krabappel shows up.

275
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,807
- Yeah!
- Great idea.

276
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,646
All right, backwards boy

277
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,564
back your butt
down to detention.

278
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,318
Over here, Simpson.

279
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,278
The detention room
is dangerously overcrowded,

280
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,131
so you'll be serving your time
in the cafeteria.

281
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,281
Oxygen running out.

282
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,759
Yes, you should have
thought of that

283
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,702
before you made
that paper airplane.

284
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,621
This overcrowding
in detention

285
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,039
is becoming critical.

286
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,483
It's a powder keg
waiting to go off

287
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,376
in an explosion of
unacceptable behavior.

288
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,294
Don't bitch to me,
boss man.

289
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,563
Thanks to the latest
budget cuts,

290
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,007
I'm down to using
grade "F" meat.

291
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,968
Wouldn't it be wonderful

292
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,445
if there was a common solution
to both our problems?

293
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,846
That would be great.

294
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,514
Hey, Bart, watch this.

295
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,101
- Oh, drats!
- Oh, no!

296
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,978
My favorite outfit.

297
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:04,690
Jimbo, this is by far
the worst... mmm.

298
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,947
Jimbo, why don't you assist
lunch lady Doris in the kitchen?

299
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,783
- Bite me, Skinner.
- Well, might we.

300
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,994
It's hard for me
to clean this giant pot

301
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,121
when you keep spilling
meat tenderizer all over me.

302
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,625
Oh great. Now I got to work
in the dark.

303
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,885
This sandwich tastes
so young and impudent.

304
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,928
Seymour, what's
with the good grub?

305
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,639
Well, perhaps I ought to
let you folks in on a secret.

306
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,683
You remember me
telling Jimbo Jones

307
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,144
that I'd make something of him
one day?

308
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,272
Are you saying
you killed Jimbo,

309
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,524
processed his carcass
and served him for lunch?

310
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,201
Hmm... I wonder
where Jimbo is today.

311
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,324
He should have
beaten us up

312
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,079
for our lunch money
an hour ago.

313
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,413
Frau lunch lady.

314
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,332
Please to have
another sloppy Jimbo.

315
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,625
Das ist gut, nein?

316
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,628
That's your third helping,
young man.

317
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,171
It's making you fat
and soft...

318
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,715
and tender.

319
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,468
Mmm... you just cut
in line, didn't you?

320
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,471
- Report to detention, Uter.
- For how long?

321
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,973
Oh, about seven minutes
a pound should do it.

322
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,773
Okay, I got your
German grub right here.

323
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:31,193
Bart, does it strike you as odd
that Uter disappeared

324
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,279
and suddenly they're serving us
this mysterious food

325
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,656
called "Uterbraten"?

326
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,491
Oh, relax, kids.

327
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,452
I've got a gut feeling
Uter's around here somewhere.

328
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,998
After all, isn't there
a little Uter in all of us?

329
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,381
In fact, you might even say
we just ate Uter

330
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,299
and he's in our stomachs
right now.

331
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,427
Wait. Scratch that one.

332
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,181
Mom! You've got to help.

333
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,268
They're cooking kids
in the school cafeteria.

334
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,353
Listen kids. You're eight
and ten years old now.

335
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,730
I can't be fighting all
your battles for you.

336
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,108
- But, Mom...
- No "buts."

337
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,277
You march right back
to that school

338
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,071
look them in the eye
and say, "don't eat me."

339
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,239
Okay.

340
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:26,123
Since so many students have been
put on permanent detention...

341
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,669
We've merged everyone
into a single class.

342
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,671
I trust there are no objections.

343
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,971
Detention.

344
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,318
Psst! Hey, you guys.

345
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:58,447
I was just thinking
that any of us could be next.

346
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,741
So what do you say
we make a break for it?

347
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,420
Easy there, young man.

348
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,881
You'll only make yourself
tired and stringy.

349
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,759
Now to check on
the free-range children.

350
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,848
Hold on, kids!

351
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,976
I'm coming to rescue
the lot of you.

352
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,770
I'll... Ow!

353
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,271
Ah... I'm bad at this.

354
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:39,279
I'm going to enjoy
devouring you, Bart Simpson.

355
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:44,326
Yes, I believe I'll start,
as you've so often suggested

356
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,912
by eating your shorts.

357
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,301
Don't worry, guys.

358
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,887
Something always
comes along to save us.

359
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,599
Nevertheless,
I remain confident

360
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,476
that something
will come along

361
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,311
and save the two
Simpson children.

362
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,111
Relax, honey.

363
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,238
You were just having
a crazy nightmare.

364
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,698
You're back with
your family now

365
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,075
where there's nothing
to be afraid of,

366
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:28,036
except that fog
that turns people inside out.

367
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,373
It's seeping in.

368
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,500
Stupid, cheap
weather stripping.

369
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,179
One.

370
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,806
Chorus line of people.

371
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:51,393
Dancing till
they make us stop.

372
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,312
Too.

373
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,314
Many dancing people.

374
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,942
Covered with blood,
gore and glop.

375
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,945
Just one sniff
of that fog.

376
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:06,325
And you're inside out.

377
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,953
It's worse than that
flesh-eating virus.

378
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:13,957
You've read about.

379
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,210
Vital organs, they are
what we're dressed in.

380
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:21,298
The family dog is eyeing
Bart's intestine.

381
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:25,886
Happy Halloween.

382
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,103
Get off!
