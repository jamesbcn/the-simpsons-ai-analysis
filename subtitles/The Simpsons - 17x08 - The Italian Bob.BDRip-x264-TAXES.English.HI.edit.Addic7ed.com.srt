352
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,370
We're in a foreign city,
with no car,

353
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,602
being stalked
by a killer.

354
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,489

Hey, Krusty's in an opera
here in Rome.

357
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,041
He can save our lives.
Come on, let's go!

That's not funny.

364
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,768
Here we'll change "wealthy merchant"
to "nudist with big rack."

365
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,366
This needs punching up.
That's coming out.

366
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,487
Two acts?

367
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,766
Krusty, you gotta
help us!

368
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,001
I don't do "gotta."

369
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,890
Sideshow Bob has sworn
a vendetta against us!

370
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,169
Vendetta? What's that?
An Italian vending machine?

371
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,407
Ahhh! That's my opening joke,

372
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,168
and my closer, and my saver,
and my topper! (SOBS)

373
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,521
Please help us, Krusty.

374
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,251
We don't want to be the first
Christians to die at the Coliseum.

375

I'll tell you what.

376
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,324
Put on these costumes.
Go on the stage

377
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,090
and mix in with
the crowd scenes.

378

He won't kill you in front
of all those witnesses.

379
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,964
Can I be the
Phantom of the Opera?

380
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,804
Dad, the Phantom
isn't in this.

381
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,962
But I do a great
impression of him!

Hey, don't blame me.
I didn't write this crap.

391
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,290
I can't believe what that clown
is doing to Leoncavallo!

392
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,885

What else we got here.

398
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,331
So I had this
beautiful tour guide, right?

399
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,767
And I tell her,
"I wanna see your Naples."

400
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,126
She slapped me!
