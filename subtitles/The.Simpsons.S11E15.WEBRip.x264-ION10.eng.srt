{\an8}Absolutely.

{\an8}If you watch even one second

{\an8}you are a thief.

{\an8}OK, take it easy, Betty.

Well, now, it's <i>your </i>turn

75
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,880
{\an8}to phone it in-- your pledge, that is.

76
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,216
Please. Please!

77
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:42,431
We're only $10,000 away

78
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,643

(phone ringing)

80
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,272
Yes, I'd like to pledge $10,000

81
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,355
to get them to shut up.

82
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,016

83
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:54,901
Done and done.

84
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,904
Dad, you don't have $10,000.

85
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,236
Aw, how they going to find me?

86
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:04,656
Folks, we just reached
our goal of $10,700,

87
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,624
and it's all thanks
to one generous caller

88
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,365
who didn't leave his name.

90
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,875
But thanks to Insta-Trace,

91
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,510
we learned it's Homer Simpson,
of 742 Evergreen Terrace.

92
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,762
(screams) Oh, why did I
register with Insta-Trace?

93
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:22,431
Our pledge-enforcement van
will be at his house in moments.

94
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,762
Uh-oh. You got to help me, Bart.

95
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,559
That's it, boy. Go get help.

96
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,272
D-oh!

97
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,819
OK, Homer, don't panic.

98
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,066
Let me do the talking.

99
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,623
Here he is, folks--

100
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,251
The man who saved PBS--
Homer Simpson!

00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,829
(crowd cheering)

102
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,128
Mom, Dad's on PBS.

103
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,380
Hmm? They don't show
police chases, do they?

104
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,973
<i>Um... It's an honor to give $10,000.</i>

105
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,890
<i>Especially now, when the rich</i>
<i>mosaic of cable programming</i>

106
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:09,641

<i>so very, very unnecessary.</i>

(clapping)

108
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,689
From now on, one of us always stays home.

109
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,611
Agreed.

110
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,189
Well said, Homer.

111
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,824
And now for the moment of generosity.

112
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:19,991
Will cash be OK?

113
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,239
Absolutely.

114
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,951
Well, then we got a problem.
The banks are closed by now.

115
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,122
It's 12:15.

116
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,949
Maybe your movie star banks
are open crazy hours,

117
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,156
but we in Springfield are simple folk.

118
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:33,076
We like our cars fast
and our banks closed.

119
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,085
OK, fine, we'll go down there,

120
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,500
but they're not going to be open.

121
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,181
Yeah... It's a real ghost town
in there.

122
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,597
Get in there.

123
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:51,273
I'd like to withdraw $10,000, please.

124
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,601
"You are on television.

125
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,635
Please play along."

126
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:54,558
Are you robbing me?

127
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,189
I'll pay you later.

128
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,232
Um, is there a problem, Mr. Simpson?

129
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,396
Uh. Why, no.

130
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,744
Everything is just...

131
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,148
(sputtering)

132
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,743
Oh! I can't do it!

133
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,044
I can't kill a man.

134
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,290
(sputtering)

135
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,212
You don't have the money,
do you, Homer?

136
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,210
Mm-mmm.

137
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,041
And you thought you could
stab your problems away?

138
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:18,957
Mm-hmm.

139
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,085
Silly goose. Why didn't you say so?

140
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,764
Get him, boys.

141
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,045
Ah! The hooligans!

142
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,554

It's a beautiful day

147
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,484

148
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,153

Bingo!

153
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,378
Sanctuary!

154
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,538
Sanctuary!

155
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,957
Oh, why did I teach him that word?

156
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,127
Quick, you got
to hide me from PBS.

157
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,256
Their bloodthirsty pursuit
is made possible

158
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,763
by a grant from the Chubb Group.

159
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,392
Give us the money!

160
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,853
Elmo knows where you live.

161
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,274
Please help me. I'll do anything.

162
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,352
I'll light a candle.

163
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,307
I'll help with your next charity scam.

164
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,107
The word is "drive."

165
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,400
Sure, sure. Bob's your uncle.

166
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,993
Let's just get out of here.

167
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,238
Open the door!

168
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,739
(crowd yelling)

169
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,331
(clears throat)
Nothing to see here, people.

170
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,621
Just headed down to the dump

171
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,084
with these children's letters to god.

172
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,285
(squeals)

173
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,007
We'll send you someplace safe

174
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,800
till the heat dies down.

175
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,644
Great, but why am I on a plane?

176
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,809
Homer, how would you like
to be a missionary

177
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,219
in the South Pacific?

178
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,887
South Pacific? I didn't agree to...

179
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,439
(groans)

180
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,060
Wa-Wait! I'm no missionary.

181
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,148
I don't even believe in Jebus.

182
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,573
Let me out!

183
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,031
Sorry. No can do.

184
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:14,115
Oh, save me, Jebus!

185
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,077
Mmm.

186
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,125
(chuckling)

187
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,094
Ah!

188
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,510
Mmm...

189
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,881
(smacking)

190
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,837
Well... little piece there.

191
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,848
(smacking) Mmm.

192
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,810
(clears throat)

193
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,349
So, you said on the phone

194
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,892
you had something to tell me?

195
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,555
Hmm? Oh, yes.

196
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,854
-Your husband's in Microatia.
-(gasps)

197
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,978
Microatia?

198
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,524
That's 12,000 miles away.

199
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,977
Uh-huh. He needed
to get away for a while.

200
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,198
I suggested missionary work,
and he jumped at the idea.

201
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,699
Missionary work?

202
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,911
He's dead, isn't he?

203
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,620
No, no. You can even keep
in touch with him

204
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,041
on this ham radio.

205
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,964
HOMER: <i>Jebus, where are you?</i>

206
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,461
<i>Homer to Jebus.</i>

207
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,384
(groaning) <i>Oh...</i>

208
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,378
(groans) Oh.

209
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,218
This doesn't look so bad.

210
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,144
Aw... Hi, there, little fella.

211
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,271
(mumbles)

212
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,140
(gasping in horror)

213
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,938
Welcome aboard, brother.

214
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,073
You must be Homer.

215
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,609
I'm Craig. That's Amy.

216
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,066
Well, see ya.

217
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,032
You're leaving?

218
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,572
Wait! What do I do here?

219
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,275
First of all, forget everything

220
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,075
you learned in missionary school.

221
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,028
Done.

222
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,158
We taught them some English

223
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,794
and ridiculed away most of their beliefs.

224
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,831
So, you can take it from there. Bye.

225
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,749
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

226
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,383
Seriously.

227
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,548
Me Homer.

228
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,604
Me hiding from PBS.

229
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,888
I am Qtoktok, and this is Ak.

230
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,733
Welcome, Reverend Homer.

231
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,060
We look forward to learning
about the Bible from you.

232
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,725
Here you go. Knock yourself out.

233
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,815
We cannot read.

234
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,939
Oh! Does the word "jet lag"

235
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,397
mean anything to you people?

236
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,486
HOMER: Jet... lag.

237
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,832
(Homer slurping)

238
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,118
Are you enjoying your ox testicle?

239
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,162
Oh, yes. Very much so.

240
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,206
Really?

241
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,789
You sure you wouldn't
rather have a coconut?

242
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,705
(chuckling) They're delicious.

243
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,633
No. I'm good.

244
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,424
Um...

245
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,717
Hey, what happened
to all the shirtless girls

246
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,590
you see in all
the geographical magazines?

247
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,557
Craig and Amy gave us the gift of shame.

248
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,480
All the naked women are on that island.

249
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,978
(women giggling)

250
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,150
Yeah, anything
goes over there. (chuckles)

251
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,148
Bouncy, bouncy.

252
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,479
-Ah!
-(rumbling)

253
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,185
What was that?

254
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,734
Oh, we call that...

255
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:55,147
(gagging)

256
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,449
Sorry, fishbone in my throat.

257
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,781
We call that "earthquake."

258
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,696
Great. Now my
testicle's got ants on it.

259
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,830
Thanks, sweetheart.

260
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,865
Have a Bible.

261
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,498
My name's Homer.

262
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,424
What's yours?

263
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,002
I am Oovilu-Eeoo-Kitana-Wanjay.

264
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,759
I'm going to call you Lisa Junior.

265
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,720
So, what do you do
for fun around here?

266
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,513
Craig and Amy were digging a well.

267
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,731
Craig and Amy were
also building a chapel.

268
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,941
"Craig and Amy, Craig and Amy."

269
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,649
Why don't you just
marry Craig and Amy?

270
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,439
I told you we should have asked them.

271
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,284
Oh, how's the TV reception here?

272
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,189
Excellent or...?

273
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,986
T... V?

274
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,110
You don't have TV?

275
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,701
But what will I watch
while I'm sitting on the couch?

276
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,412
Cou-ouch?

277
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,244
No couches either?

278
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,407
Oh, man, I need a beer.

279
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,710
(gasps)

280
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,211
Oh, god! Oh, god!

281
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,502
Oh, god! Oh, god!

282
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,875
NATIVES: Oh, god, oh, god.

283
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,382
Oh, god, oh, god.

284
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,506
(grunting)

285
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,764
(smacking)

286
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,850
Nothing.

287
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,349
Here we go.

288
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,481
Ee... Yeah.

289
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,231
(Marge's voice) Homer?

290
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,613
Homer!

291
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,399
Huh? What the...?

292
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,612
Hello! Hello! Hello!

293
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,816
<i>Is there anybody in there?</i>

294
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,237
Marge!

295
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,034
Homer, are you all right?

296
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,156
I guess so, but that first month
was pretty rough.

297
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,913
You've only been gone two days.

298
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,325
Really? Without TV, it's hard to know

299
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,174
when one day begins and the other ends.

300
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,249
I miss you, Dad.

301
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,133
Mom won't let me read
<i>Hagar the Horrible.</i>

302
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,250
I just don't think it's funny.

303
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,047
Mmm, I can see the house
is falling apart without me

304
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,302
so here's the new order:

305
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,393
<i>-Bart, you're the man of the house.</i>
-Mmm.

306
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,969
-HOMER: <i>Lisa, I'm promoting you to boy.</i>
-(growls)

307
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,137
HOMER: <i>Maggie's now the brainy girl.</i>

308
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,562
<i>The toaster can fill in for Maggie.</i>

309
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,889
<i>And, Marge, you're a consultant.</i>

310
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:49,976
(groans) Oh...

311
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,936
-Dad?
-Yes, boy?

312
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,691
I just want to tell you
how proud I am that you're showing

313
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,284
an interest in your fellow man.

314
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,738
Really?

315
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,150
You're proud of me?

316
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,356
Oh, yes.

317
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,116
The whole town thinks
you're a real humanitarian.

318
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,529
Ned Flanders is green with envy.

319
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,698
Oh, <i>really?</i>

320
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,667
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I've got some civilization

321
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,289
to spread like butter
on the English muffin

322
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:18,206
that is these people, with all
their little nooks and crannies.

323
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,167
Dad, are you licking toads?

324
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,127
I'm not not licking toads.

325
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,138
Well, it's time to get to work.

326
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,060
Humanitarian Homer Simpson,
over and out.

327
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:27,969
(static)

328
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,059
(croaking)

329
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,444
Ah... Um...

330
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,480
-(croaks)
-(chuckles)

331
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,768
Gather 'round, everyone.

332
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,107
I'm going to teach you about religion.

333
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,453
NATIVES: Oh, god,
oh, god, oh, god.

334
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,699
Please, please, that's not necessary.

335
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,741
I'm just God's messenger.

336
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,448
{\an8}And lo,
what a wondrous message it is.

337
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:53,827
{\an8}Like this,
from the book of... P-salms.

338
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,381
{\an8}God will shatter the heads
of his enemies.

339
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:01,131
{\an8}The hairy crown of those
who walk in their guilty ways.

340
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,375
{\an8}That you may bathe
your feet in blood.

341
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,761
As true today as it was
when it was written.

342
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,517
Now, let's open it up
to some "Q" and "A."

343
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,977
Yes, Lisa Junior?

344
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,444
Amy said there are lots of religions.

345
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,600
Which is the right one?

346
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,978
Well, not the Unitarians.

347
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,324
If that's the one true faith,
I'll eat my hat.

348
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,820
Um, if the Lord is all powerful

349
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,572
why does he care whether
we worship him or not?

350
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,529
Ak just saying.

351
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,775
Well, Ak, it's because

352
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,698
God is powerful but also insecure

353
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,787
like Barbra Streisand before James Brolin.

354
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,634
Oh, he's been a rock.

355
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,303
Oh, who am I kidding?

356
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,009
The truth is, I'm no missionary.

357
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,049
I work in a nuclear power plant.

358
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,723
Ooh, tell us all you know
about nuclear power.

359
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,267
Look, the point is, I want to help

360
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,349
but you don't need a well or a chapel

361
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,975
or an immunization center.

362
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,401
What you need is a little razzle-dazzle.

363
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,360
(snaps fingers)

364
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,280
Qtoktok, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

365
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,279
I am Ak.

366
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,990
Hey, that's great.

367
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,030
Now let's get to work.

368
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,327
Now, if <i>the Flintstones</i>
has taught us anything

369
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,249
it's that pelicans
can be used to mix cement.

370
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,409
Come on, little friend,
make a wisecrack.

371
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,327
You know, "it's a living,"
that sort of thing.

372
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,383
Oopsie.

373
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,841
-Hiya, Homer.
-That's not Homer.

374
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,085
It's got to be.
He's parking in Homer's space.

375
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,678
Well, time to get to work.

376
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,018
(sighs)

377
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,347
-Simpson.
-D-ah!

378
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,645
I've just reviewed your ten-year

379
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,358
performance record,
and it's appalling.

380
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,519
But I'm not Homer Simpson.

381
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,897
I think I know
who Homer Simpson is.

382
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,613
{\an8}In ten short years,

383
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,914
you've caused 17 meltdowns.

384
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,408
-One is too many.
-Yeah, but...

385
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,910
You sold weapons-grade plutonium

386
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,331
-to the Iraqis with no markup.
-But...

387
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,870
And worst of all, you took

388
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,544
the Hamburglar's birthday off

389
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,962
last Monday and Wednesday.
Which is it?

390
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,915
(sighs) Now my voice is giving out

391
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,421
so I'm just going to poke you
for the next hour or so.

392
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,344
-(grunts)
-(groans)

393
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,131
-(groans)
-(grunts)

394
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,255
(groaning)

395
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,346
Friends, when I came here
one month ago

396
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,468
this seemed like a strange
and frightening place.

397
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,767
But now I've learned to love
this island

398
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,850
-as my second--
-(chopper blades whirring)

399
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:18,845
A plane!

400
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,306
Stop! Get me off this stinking rock!

401
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,557
(sighs)

402
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,648
Anyhow, I'm about to share
with you a modern-day miracle--

403
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,895
Something that has revitalized cities

404
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,568
from east St. Louis
to Biloxi, Mississippi--

405
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:36,697
The magic medicine of...
casino gambling!

406
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,962
"The Lucky Savage?"

407
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,922
It could be <i>you.</i>

408
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,591
Check it out.

409
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,842
There's Island Blackjack,

410
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:48,843
Island Craps,

411
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,264
Island Texas hold them...

412
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,342
But if like me--

413
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,047
you're mesmerized by pretty colors

414
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,257
and spinning things--

415
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,966
you'll prefer roulette.

416
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,142
Four sand dollars
on number six, please.

417
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,515
So, how you doing?

418
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,527
Staying out of trouble?

419
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,438
Yes, sir.

420
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,358
-Number six.
-Whoo-hoo!

421
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,276
HOMER: D-oh!

422
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,664
Now, over here, I've brewed up
my favorite beverage, beer.

423
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,785
It's mostly Dristan and holy water,
but it does the job.

424
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,959
Mmm, <i>ooga booga.</i>

425
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,669
(clamoring)

426
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,091
So, have fun, everybody.

427
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,459
And who knows?

428
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,005
Maybe you'll hit the jackpot,
get off this island

429
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:32,799
and spend the rest of your days
in a tropical paradise.

430
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,425
(murmuring assent)

431
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,980
Homer, I'm so impressed.

432
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,362
Everything you're doing
sounds so rewarding.

433
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,729
Oh, you should have seen
their faces, honey.

434
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,527
Now I know how Bob Stupak feels.

435
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,913
(whistling happily)

436
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,489
Is everybody happy?

437
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,825
(natives shouting)

438
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,288
(sighs)

439
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,632
Oh, my god.

440
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,803
(slurring) How can
Ace be one <i>and </i>11?

441
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,131
Huh?

442
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,046
What kind of god
would allow that?

443
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,974
(grunting weakly)

444
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,506
(groans)

445
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,810
(gasps)

446
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,693
Oh, what happened?

447
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,611
I gave you a glittering Vegas

448
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:31,279
and you turned it
into a skanky Atlantic city.

449
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,490
Your alcohol and inexpensive buffets

450
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,450
have corrupted us.

451
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,530
I don't even like macaroni salad

452
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,025
but look at me!

453
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,827
(gobbling)

454
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,749
Please help us.

455
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,672
Our island has not been this damaged

456
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,250
since the A-bomb tests.

457
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,589
(sighs)

458
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,676
Guess who I saw
at the supermarket today.

459
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,680
Can it wait?

460
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:58,801
I just got off work.

461
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,758
I'm sorry, honey, I just thought...

462
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,178
Don't you do enough yakking
at the beauty parlor?

463
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,427
That's it, Bart.

464
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,808
You're taking this
man-of-the-house thing too far.

465
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,015
You're right. I'm sorry.
Tell you what--

466
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,476
Saturday night we'll go out for steaks,

467
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,566
just you and me.

468
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,610
Hmm.

469
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,363
A night out is a night out.

470
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,487
(grunting)

471
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:23,833
{\an8}(speaking native language)

472
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,960
Why are you building chapel?

473
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,342
Because you're all terrible sinners.

474
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,420
Since when?

475
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,714
Since I got here.

476
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,257
Now, either grab a stone or go to hell.

477
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,087
(all gasping)

478
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,262
(groaning)

479
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,349
HOMER: Well, I may not know
much about God,

480
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:50,435
but I have to say, we built
a pretty nice cage for him.

481
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,232
(chattering)

482
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,686
These are from the children.

483
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,395
Thanks to you, they finally
have a place to pray.

484
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,446
Aw...

485
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,029
And I'm in a gambling program

486
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,235
for real, this time.

487
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,775
How many times must we

488
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,578
go to church to avoid hell?

489
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,961
Every Sunday for the rest of our lives.

490
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,119
(laughing)

491
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,917
-No, really?
-(bell ringing)

492
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,054
Not bad, Lisa Junior.

493
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:19,381
But god's palace is
way up on the moon

494
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,890
so if we want him to hear us

495
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,352
we've got to crank up the volume.

496
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,557
You hear me, Lord?

497
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,686
Homer's doing your work.

498
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,478
I'm the greatest missionary

499
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,023
(echoing) of all time!

500
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,947
(screaming)

501
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,247
(yells)

502
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,588
Oh, no. This looks like the end.

503
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:04,045
(screaming)

504
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,097
(chuckling) Oh, that Homer--

505
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,681
Always getting into trouble

506
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,266
and if you're one of the millions

507
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,981
who enjoys his adventures--

508
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,811
Or should I say, misadventures--

509
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,816
It's time to show your support.

510
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,438
Sure, Fox makes
a fortune from advertising,

511
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,316
but it's still not enough.

512
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,613
Not nearly enough.

513
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:24,196
{\an8}So if you don't want to see
crude, lowbrow programming

514
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,083
{\an8}disappear from the airwaves...

515
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,036
Please, call now.

516
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,331
{\an8}(phone ringing)

517
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,714
Hello. Murdoch here.

518
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,576
Ten thousand dollars?

519
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,630
You've saved my network.

520
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,172
Wouldn't be the first time.

521
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,471
(theme music playing)

522
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,349
Shh.

523
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,508
HOMER: <i>Save me, Jebus</i>!
