00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:06,376
{\an8}<i>♪ The Simpsons ♪</i>

2
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:07,594
(tires screech)

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:10,506
D'oh!

4
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:13,053
-Aah!
-(tires screech)

00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,701
{\an8}<i>Ai! Que agonia!</i>

6
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,070
{\an8}(laughing)

7
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:36,488
{\an8}Oh, he wants
that corn so much.

8
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:41,713
{\an8}<i>Ai! Dios no me ama.</i>

9
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,844
{\an8}So good.

10
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,799
{\an8}Huh? I want to see what's
on the other broadcasts.

11
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,881
{\an8}Where's the oscillator
on this thing?

12
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,836
{\an8}-No, Grampa, don't!
-No, Grampa, don't!

13
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,756
{\an8}-Dad, sit down!
-Gosh darn it!

14
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,555
{\an8}What does this do?

15
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,678
{\an8}I'll make my adjustments
here and...

16
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,227
{\an8}(glass shattering)

17
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,734
{\an8}(tires screeching)

18
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:09,105
{\an8}(together)
Yay! We're getting a new TV!

19
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,744
{\an8}Let's go to
The Sharper Image.

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,030
{\an8}They've got a TV shaped
like a '50s diner.

21
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,284
{\an8}No, let's go
to The Nature Company.

22
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,866
{\an8}They've got a TV
assembled by Hopi Indians.

23
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:21,412
{\an8}We can't afford to shop at
any store that has a philosophy.

24
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,038
{\an8}We just need a TV.

25
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:26,004
{\an8}We're going to go
to the outlet mall in Ogdenville.

26
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,796
{\an8}(moaning)

27
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:49,027
(gasps) Look at these
low, low prices

28
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,689
on famous brand-name
electronics.

29
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,447
Don't be a sap, Dad.
These are just crappy knock-offs.

30
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,660
(scoffs) I know a genuine
Panaphonics when I see it.

31
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,541
And look, there's
Magnetbox and Sorny.

32
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,289
Listen, I'm not going
to lie to you.

33
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,041
Those are all
superior machines,

34
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,083
but if you like
to watch your TV--

35
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,416
and I mean,
really watch it--

36
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,052
{\an8}you want the Carnivale.

37
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,129
It features
two-pronged wall plug,

38
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,884
pre-molded
hand-grip well,

39
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,296
durable outer casing
to prevent fall-apart...

40
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,965
Sold. You wrap it up,
I'll start bringing in the pennies.

41
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,477
Honey, I don't think
these clothes are us.

42
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,862
Who are they?

43
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,188
Hey, Brandine

44
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,113
you can wear this shirt to work.

45
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,191
Oh, Cletus, you know I got to wear
the shirt what Dairy Queen give me.

46
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,664
Hey, Mom, there's
something in here.

47
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,491
Ooh.

48
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,747
Oh, it's beautiful.

49
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,709
Can it be a real Chanel?

50
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,669
(gasps)
It is!

51
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,634
90 dollars?

52
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,801
(groans)

53
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,129
But it's marked
down from 2,800.

54
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,021
Oh, you look
so sophisticated.

55
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,980
Just like Mary Hart.

56
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,940
It fits like
a dream too.

57
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,611
But we can't
afford $90

58
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,479
even if it is
a bargain.

59
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,486
It wouldn't be right to
buy something just for me.

60
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:18,109
If it were a suit we could
all wear, maybe, then...

61
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,408
Come on Mom, you never treat
yourself to anything.

62
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,161
Oh, sure, I do.

63
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,163
I treated myself to a Sanka
not three days ago.

64
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,785
But this is a real find.

65
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,084
Just buy it.

66
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,917
You don't have to
rationalize everything.

67
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,052
(groans)

68
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,419
All right, I will buy it.

69
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,296
It will be good
for the economy.

70
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,755
(easy listening music plays)

71
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,642
(whistles)

72
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,523
You look great.

73
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,440
Really?
You like it?

74
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,268
Oh, I'd love to wear this
someplace special.

75
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,565
Spurlock's Cafeteria,
it is.

76
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,940
Mmm. What about
the symphony or the theater?

77
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,197
Oh, gah, geez.

78
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,778
What's the point
of going out?

79
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,123
We're just going to
wind up back here, anyway.

80
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,949
(groans)

81
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,454
(singing in Italian)

82
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,037
(vacuum starts)

83
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,969
Oh, Mrs. Simpson, you are
looking very prosperous today.

84
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,389
Might I interest you
in some of our impulse items

85
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,758
here by the cash register?

86
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,684
Perhaps a crazy motorized
wiggle pen?

87
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,184
(laughing)
Look at... the craziness.

88
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,187
Attendant, I'd like some gas.

89
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,150
Yes, I'm sorry,
I do not speak English okay.

90
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,651
But you were
just talking to...

91
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,572
Yes, hot dog, hot dog,
yes, sir, no sir, maybe, okay.

92
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,202
Well, I can't pump it myself.

93
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,699
I'm calling triple "A."

94
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,660
I used to be a little
overwhelmed too

95
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,200
but it's not that hard.

96
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,494
I can show you.

97
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,536
Marge? Is that you?

98
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,660
Marge Bouvier,
from high school?

99
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,667
Um... yeah.

100
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,579
Hi. Hi, Evelyn.

101
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,208
How about that.

102
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,005
Marge,
you look wonderful.

103
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,838
And to think I heard
you married Homer Simpson.

104
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:00,844
I did marry Homer.

105
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,848
Come, you must
show me the pumps.

106
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,679
90% of the time,
if the gas isn't pumping,

107
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,225
this is your problem.

108
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,229
Automotive skills
and fashion sense.

109
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,862
Well, you've come a long way

110
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,818
from the girl I knew
nothing about in high school.

111
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,648
We ran with different crowds.

112
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,444
You had your
debutante balls

113
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,237
and skinny-dipping,

114
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,281
and I had my...

115
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,534
home shoe repair course.

116
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,616
Oh, Marge, you haven't
changed a bit

117
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,412
as far as I know.

118
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,575
Say, why don't you drop by
the country club tomorrow?

119
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,584
Oh, and bring the family.

120
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,755
(antique horn honking)

121
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,758
You there, fill it up
with petroleum distillate

122
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,091
and re-vulcanize my tires,
post haste.

123
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,138
Bart, comb your hair.

124
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:52,313
Homer, I don't think you should
wear a short-sleeved shirt

125
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,523
with a tie.

126
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,103
Oh, but Sipowicz does it.

127
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,108
If Detective Sipowicz
jumped off a cliff,

128
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,270
would you do that too?

129
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,028
Aw, I wish I was
Sipowicz.

130
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,689
Do I have to go?

131
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,988
That country club is a hotbed
of exclusionist snobs

132
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,952
and status-seeking
social-climbers.

133
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,122
I've told you, I don't like
you using the word "hotbed."

134
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,662
Please, Lisa, we so rarely
get to do things like this.

135
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,537
And everybody, everybody please,
be on your best behavior.

136
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,285
Bart, no grifting.

137
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,997
Ah, raspberries.

138
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,013
Name, please?

139
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,933
Simpson family.

140
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,141
We're not poor.

141
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,772
Well, we're not.

142
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,519
Go on in.
They're expecting you at the clubhouse.

143
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,607
(all gasping)

144
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,689
Wow. Living large.

145
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,025
Oh, my.

146
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,110
I've always dreamed
of coming here.

147
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,565
Everybody, keep smiling

148
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,735
and I know we're going
to fit right in.

149
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,293
(screams)

150
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,418
EVELYN:
Oh, Marge. You made it.

151
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,802
And you wore
that lovely suit.

152
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,835
Kar-rin, Gill-ian, Elyza-beth

153
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,755
Pa-tree-sia,
Rowber-tah, Seuss-in

154
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,425
Meet Marge.

155
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,353
-Hello.
-How you doing?

156
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,062
Pleased to
meet you.

157
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,813
You look like such a
happy bunch... of people.

158
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,356
That's the trouble
with first impressions.

159
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,151
You only get to make one.

160
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,824
(ladies giggling)

161
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,242
Oh.

162
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,820
That reminds me of
a funny apron I saw.

163
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,447
You know Marge, your family

164
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,794
doesn't have to stand
in the alcove.

165
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,869
They're free
to enjoy the club.

166
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,624
(sighing)

167
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,496
Ugh, come on kids,
let's go sit in the car

168
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,294
till your Mom's done
fitting in.

169
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,341
Elyza-beth is right.

170
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,683
Why shout yourself hoarse
at incompetent sales clerks

171
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,888
when you can get nearly
everything mail order?

172
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,180
Um hum, I won't eat
anything

173
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,473
unless it's
shipped overnight

174
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,346
from Vermont or
Washington state.

175
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,943
We order our steaks
through the "New Yorker."

176
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,769
I have a sneaking suspicion that

177
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,654
L.L. Bean and Eddie Bauer
are selling me the same honey.

178
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,772
(ladies tittering)

179
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,858
I get food
through the mail,

180
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,613
but in a different way.

181
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,195
Every month,
"Good Housekeeping"

182
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,700
arrives in my mailbox,
bursting with recipes.

183
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,872
Sometimes, the most
satisfying meal

184
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,661
is the one you
cook yourself.

185
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,995
Hmm.

186
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,869
That's very true, Marge.

187
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,996
One night, Wif and I
came home late,

188
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,793
and we decided not
to wake Iris

189
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,667
and instead,
we microwaved our own soup.

190
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,255
(women chattering)

191
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,341
Of course,
it was a horrible mess,

192
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,426
but Iris didn't mind
cleaning it up.

193
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,852
(ladies tittering)

194
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,100
Why can't my Thurston
be more like Wif?

195
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,721
That Iris is a gem.

196
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,403
MARGE: Didn't everybody have
a wonderful time?

197
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,269
I thought it was so opulent

198
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,226
like the Playboy mansion,
but nonsexual.

199
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,527
That place is weird.

200
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,950
A man in the bathroom

201
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,448
kept handing me towels
till I paid him to stop.

202
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,951
Should have held out
longer, boy.

203
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,032
The rich are different
from you and me.

204
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,197
Yes, they're better.

205
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,332
Socially better,
and if we fit in

206
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,124
we can be better too.

207
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,088
So today, while the rest of you
were out being different,

208
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,548
I did a very good job of
fitting in--

209
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,669
so good that Evelyn
gave us a guest pass.

210
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,336
They might even ask us to join.

211
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,434
Boy, Marge!

212
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,350
You must have really done
a number on those rich suckers.

213
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,559
Don't thank me.

214
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,519
Thank my beautiful
new suit.

215
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,362
Oh, Fritz, you idiot.

216
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,569
I didn't order
a bologna sandwich.

217
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,440
I ordered an abalone sandwich.

218
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,490
I don't know
what Mom's thinking.

219
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,572
This whole country club scene
is so decadent.

220
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:38,157
All these... spoiled... brats...
and... their... smug

221
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,004
complacent parents.

222
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,999
It just reinforces
the unspoken class... system...

223
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,332
of horses... sitting...
on... their... high... horses.

224
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,088
I'm sorry. I got to go!

225
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,097
<i>Oh. We've got a winning hand.</i>

226
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,809
<i>We can take</i>
<i>the rest of the tricks.</i>

227
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,469
<i>Oh, you better be careful.</i>

228
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,268
<i>The purpose of this game</i>
<i>is to make friends.</i>

229
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,851
<i>You don't make friends</i>
<i>by winning.</i>

230
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,896
<i>Still, there's nothing</i>
<i>more popular</i>

231
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,320
<i>than a gracious winner.</i>

232
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,358
<i>Don't ask me.</i>
<i>I'm just hair.</i>

233
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,112
<i>Your head stopped</i>
<i>18 inches ago.</i>

234
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,074
Hmm...

235
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,534
Queen of hearts.

236
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,914
I believe all the rest
are ours.

237
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,451
Oh, well played.

238
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,044
We could have stopped them

239
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,039
if you had changed
to a different suit.

240
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,911
I thought, perhaps,
changing suits

241
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,538
had gone out of fashion.

242
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,915
Eh, Marge?

243
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,381
(women tittering)

244
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,381
(Marge grumbles)

245
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,629
D'oh!

246
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:36,505
(moaning)

247
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,932
Mmm.

248
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,644
(chuckling)

249
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,984
You know, Homer,

250
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,559
the traditional way
to cheat in golf

251
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,064
is to lower your score.

252
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,395
That's one way.

253
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,520
I'm P.G.A. Tour
Pro Tom Kite.

254
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,277
How about I give you a
few pointers on your game?

255
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,570
Now, you don't want
to overthink.

256
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,784
Not an issue.

257
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:56,783
Keep your head down.

258
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,164
Huh?

259
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,580
Pretend there's
no one else here.

260
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,950
(belches)

261
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,826
And just go at your own pace.

262
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,884
Wow, very impressive.

263
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,459
You're a natural,
Mr. Simpson.

264
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,004
Really?

265
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,508
Uh-huh. All you need is
your own set of clubs

266
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,050
and stay the hell
out of my locker.

267
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,394
You can keep the shoes.

268
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,431
Marge, did you know that

269
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,426
Kennedy and Lincoln
had the same handicap?

270
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,648
Homer, please,
I have to alter this suit

271
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,478
so it looks different
for tomorrow.

272
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,903
(yawning)

273
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,481
Just slap some
bumper stickers on it

274
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,736
and come to bed,
will you, Marge?

275
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,074
(snoring)

276
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,121
Love your outfit, Marge.

277
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,913
The vest says,
"let's have lunch"

278
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,666
but the culottes say,
"you're paying."

279
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,328
Why, thank you, Rowber-ta.

280
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,708
LISA:
Mom, look!

281
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,764
I found something
more fun than complaining.

282
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,679
Marge, your family

283
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,049
is fitting in
perfectly here.

284
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,007
If all goes well
at Saturday's ball,

285
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,557
I'd love to sponsor
you for membership.

286
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,941
Oh, that would be
a dream come true.

287
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,809
I'll be there
with bells on.

288
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,226
Bells?

289
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,074
Where exactly
will you be attaching them

290
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,690
to that mangled Chanel suit?

291
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,026
(ladies laughing)

292
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,532
Oh, don't worry, Marge.

293
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,073
Her idea of wit
is nothing more

294
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,697
than an incisive observation
humorously phrased

295
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,334
and delivered
with impeccable timing.

296
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,121
I'm sure you'll be
a smash at the ball,

297
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,084
and I just know you'll have
a lovely new outfit.

298
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,094
(repeated toilet splashes)

299
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,678
Hey, that's some mighty fine
chipping, Homer.

300
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,720
Yeah, can you bank it into
the handicapped stall?

301
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,433
Seat-- down.

302
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,098
(air dryer blowing)

303
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,103
(ball splashes)

304
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,056
Hmm. Who is that lavatory
linksman, Smithers?

305
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,567
Homer Simpson, sir--

306
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,728
One of the fork and spoon
operators from Sector 7G.

307
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,987
Well, he's certainly got
a loose waggle.

308
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,319
Perhaps I've finally
found a golfer

309
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,865
worthy of a match
with Monty Burns, eh?

310
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,619
Oh, his waggle is no match
for yours, sir.

311
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,411
I've never seen
you lose a game

312
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,745
except for that one in '74,
when you let Richard Nixon win.

313
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,500
That was very kind of you, sir.

314
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,132
Oh, he just looked
so forlorn, Smithers

315
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,590
with his, "Oh, I can't
go to prison, Monty.

316
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,300
They'll eat me alive."

317
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,427
Say, I wonder if this
Homer Nixon

318
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,549
is any relation.

319
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,135
Unlikely, sir. They...

320
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,970
They spell and pronounce
their name differently.

321
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,925
Bah. Schedule a game
and I'll ask him myself.

322
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,943
Oh, this game could mean
big things for me, Marge.

323
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,820
If I beat Mr. Burns..
I mean really wallop him bad,

324
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,279
I'm sure to get that big raise
I've been gunning for.

325
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,030
Alright, alright, but if you
win, don't make a scene

326
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,951
and dance around
with your "whoo-hoos," please.

327
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,951
We can't afford
a single slip-up.

328
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,033
They're judging us.

329
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,947
Mwah!

330
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,536
Mwah!

331
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,121
Mom, did you like horses
when you were my age? 'Cause I--

332
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,247
I don't know.

333
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,923
Lisa, tonight is
very important.

334
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,211
Mommy has to alter her suit
so it looks a totally new one.

335
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,506
Mom, do you want to know the 15 reasons
I like horses better than cars?

336
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,800
One, a horse never has to--

337
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,053
I really need to concentrate
on this, Lisa.

338
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,394
Would you mind just..?

339
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,679
You know how a horse
goes like this?

340
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:08,933
Mom! Like this!

341
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,724
I've already altered
this so many times,

342
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,138
-it's not even possible--
-Whinny! Mom! Mom! Mom!

343
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,227
Mom! Mom! Mom!
Mom! Mom! Mom!

344
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,271
Lisa, please!

345
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,896
Hmm.

346
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,656
(gasps)

347
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,830
No.

348
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,408
No, no, no, no!

349
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,204
(cloth rips)

350
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,868
(groaning)

351
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:38,586
At times like this, I guess
all you can do is laugh.

352
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,684
I need a formal dress
for tonight.

353
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,643
You've come
to the right place.

354
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,064
We've got classy duds
up the ying-yang.

355
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,483
I call this one
"fantasy in maroon."

356
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,062
It's got some
cigarette burns

357
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,267
but we can patch them
up with Nu-Vinyl.

358
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:03,317
It's a bit peppery for me.

359
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,162
Why don't we put this
in the "maybe" pile?

360
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,528
This was originally
a Halloween costume,

361
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,197
but it found its way
into my regular rotation.

362
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,656
Uh-huh.

363
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,667
Good morning,
Mr. Burns.

364
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,669
Beautiful day to be
outside, isn't it?

365
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,211
Rant on, Simpson,

366
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,754
but your
vainglorious boasting

367
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,047
will only add savor
to my inevitable triumph.

368
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,761
Yes.

369
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,769
Woo-hoo!

370
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,268
D'oh!

371
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,980
Yes. You're
in deep "D'oh" now.

372
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,307
(sandpaper scraping)

373
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,240
Perfect as always, sir.

374
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,872
Right on the green.

375
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,826
Oh, quit cogitating,
Steinmetz,

376
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,336
and use
an open-faced club.

377
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,838
-The sand wedge.
-Mmm.

378
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,261
Open-faced club sand wedge.

379
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,265
You're four strokes
behind, Simpson.

380
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,111
(chuckles)

381
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,728
Oh, a cunning
stratagem, sir.

382
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,105
It's curving right
toward the green,

383
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,573
and it's... there.

384
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,777
He got to the green
in one shot?

385
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:37,826
How can that old man
hit so...

386
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,673
far?

387
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,168
Now, keep
your head down.

388
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,130
Ignore all distractions.

389
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,290
(yells)

390
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,008
Hmm. Hmm.

391
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:53,052
Hmm? Miss?

392
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,387
Miss? Do you have
a Chanel suit

393
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,102
or any other
high-quality clothes?

394
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,852
No, ma'am, but we do have

395
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,984
a shipment of slightly burnt
Sears activewear

396
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,561
coming in this afternoon.

397
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,726
Oh, I give up.

398
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,689
What time and
how burnt?

399
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,985
Cripes man, can't you ever
get to the green

400
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,239
in less than two shots?

401
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,953
SMITHERS: Aagh!

402
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:14,913
(groans)

403
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,084
Smithers, what
are you doing up here?

404
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,413
What are you doing
with this ball?

405
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,207
And all those
other balls?

406
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,631
Ahh, there are
no other balls.

407
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,750
Just these, uh,
reptile eggs.

408
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,087
Ooh, step away.
They're endangered.

409
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,263
These aren't reptile eggs.

410
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,553
You've been cheating.

411
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,096
No matter where
Mr. Burns hit the ball,

412
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,220
you put a fresh one
on the green.

413
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,267
(gasps)

414
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,809
Cheating? For me?

415
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,313
Good Lord, Smithers,
that's patently unnecessary.

416
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,146
I'm one of the world's
finest golfers.

417
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,981
In all the years
you've caddied for me,

418
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,817
I've never lost a...

419
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,235
-Oh.
-So...

420
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,242
<i>♪ You're not</i>
<i>the best golfer here ♪</i>

421
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,294
<i>♪ Wait till I tell</i>
<i>everyone about this ♪</i>

422
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,288
<i>♪ You stink ♪</i>

423
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,750
Homer, Mr. Burns holds
a lot of sway at this club.

424
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,171
If you would keep quiet
about the alleged

425
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,709
decades of cheating,

426
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,713
I'm sure he'd support
your application

427
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,134
for membership tonight.

428
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,762
Bull honkey!
I don't care

429
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,418
about joining
this stupid club.

430
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,257
But does your wife?

431
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,053
Ohh.

432
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,467
(yells)

433
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,135
I knew my kind
wasn't welcome here.

434
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,229
(sighs loudly)

435
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,113
-Ooh.
-Ooh.

436
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,905
ALL:
Ahh.

437
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:38,158
Mom, you are looking fabulous.

438
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,742
Yeah. You look great.

439
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,577
You can do anything
with that sewing machine.

440
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,082
No, I can't.

441
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,503
Come on, let's go.

442
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,791
You mean it's a new dress?
Where did you get it?

443
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,424
The outlet store.

444
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,301
Wow. Two finds in one store.
What are the odds?

445
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,339
-Call it fate, let's go!
-How much did it cost?

446
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,092
-A dollar. Let's go.
-With tax or without?

447
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,344
Without. Let me go.

448
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,385
So with tax,
how much was it?

449
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,468
Why do you always
have to question

450
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,263
everything I do?

451
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,926
You look nice, is all.

452
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,437
MARGE:
Homer, what are you doing?

453
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,901
I'm driving up
to the main building.

454
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,361
They've got
valet parking tonight.

455
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,110
We can't drive this up there.

456
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,742
They'll see the dent.
They'll see the coat hanger antenna.

457
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,450
Stop the car. We're walking.

458
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,410
But Marge, valets.

459
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,030
For once, maybe someone
will call me "sir"

460
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,158
without adding,
"you're making a scene."

461
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,207
I'm going to regale everyone
with my anecdote.

462
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,585
You know, the one I tried
to say on the radio?

463
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,802
Who's going to bleep me
this time?

464
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,433
I'm going to pose
as an Italian count

465
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,349
and get some old lady
to leave me all her money.

466
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,849
I'm going to ask people

467
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,680
if they know
their servants' last names

468
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,225
or, in the case of butlers,
their first.

469
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,350
No! No! No!
Not tonight!

470
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,274
No vulgarity.
No mischief.

471
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,527
No politics.
Just be good.

472
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,199
I'm sorry, Mom.
I'll behave.

473
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,450
I won't say anything controversial.

474
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,782
I just won't say
anything, okay, honey?

475
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,249
You kids
should thank your mother.

476
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,915
Now that she's
a better person,

477
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,383
we can see how
awful we really are.

478
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:26,982
Come here, Maggie.

479
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,517
Oh, Homie,

480
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,943
I like your
in-your-face humanity.

481
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,362
I like the way
Lisa speaks her mind.

482
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,941
I like Bart's...

483
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,201
I like Bart.

484
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,320
And I like my old green dress.

485
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:46,247
I didn't have to spend our
savings on this stupid gown.

486
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,828
Our savings?

487
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,673
Don't worry.
I saved the receipt.

488
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,038
We'll have
a $3,300 credit at Chanel.

489
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,585
They have beer
and gum, right?

490
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,092
Come on, let's go.

491
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,972
I wouldn't want
to join any club

492
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,179
that would have
this me as a member.

493
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,010
It's okay.

494
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,925
Those snobs never would have
made us members, anyway.

495
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,979
Well, I wonder
where Marge could be.

496
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,480
She's missing
her own initiation.

497
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,312
I hope she didn't take

498
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,228
my attempt to destroy her
too seriously.

499
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:18,989
Where's Homer?

500
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,319
Oh, and to think
I spent all afternoon

501
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,695
baking him this cake.

502
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,740
Mmm. Grr...

503
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,247
I pickled the figs myself.

504
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,628
Hey, did you guys
just come from the prom?

505
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,384
Sort of.

506
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,335
But, you know, we realized
we're more comfortable

507
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,047
in a place like this.

508
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,137
Man, you're crazy.
This place is a dump.

509
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:54,345
Oh man, I'd be anywhere
except this place, that's for sure.
