1
00:00:13,796 --> 00:00:15,841
You said you'd be home at 7:00.

2
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,583
Go sleep on the bed.

3
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,636
Oh, dear.

4
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,117
Oh, who am I kidding?

5
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,945
I will never have enough money
to go to San Diego.

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,991
Oh, maybe next year.

7
00:00:35,165 --> 00:00:37,298
But how many next years
do I have left?

8
00:00:37,472 --> 00:00:38,995
Leave me.

9
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:41,302
I have no patience
for buyers, sellers,

10
00:00:41,476 --> 00:00:43,478
or parking meter
quarter needers.

11
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:46,176
I didn't drag this wagon
full of garbage

12
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,178
to be yelled at
by a talking circle!

13
00:00:48,352 --> 00:00:50,180
Ouch. Yes. Well, touchÃ©.

14
00:00:50,354 --> 00:00:52,008
Listen up, super size.

15
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:53,705
I want to get rid
of Seymour's toys

16
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,229
before he turns 60.

17
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:58,623
Oh, let's see, nothing of value,
nothing of val...

18
00:00:58,797 --> 00:01:00,190
Wait a minute.

19
00:01:00,364 --> 00:01:02,497
Oh, my God, this is why I nerd.

20
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:05,021
Yes! An original
Radioactive Man doll.

21
00:01:05,195 --> 00:01:06,718
Hmm, mint in box too.

22
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:09,939
Yes, I may have occasionally
seen one of these.

23
00:01:10,113 --> 00:01:11,810
In my dreams!

24
00:01:11,984 --> 00:01:14,813
Yes, excuse me
just for one moment.

25
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:19,818
I might make money!

26
00:01:19,992 --> 00:01:22,473
Hulk smash! Hulk smash!

27
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:27,043
Three, two, sold!

28
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:30,525
At last, I can afford
a trip to Comicalooza.

29
00:01:30,699 --> 00:01:33,702
Oh, but not enough money
for my wife.

30
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:37,923
Oh, what luck.
And the first chance to wear

31
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,579
my Doctor Octopus costume
since my uncle's funeral.

32
00:01:41,753 --> 00:01:44,539
It is happening!

33
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,859
Do you still have it?
Do you?

34
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:02,557
I'm afraid not.

35
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:04,515
It's on its way
to a lucky collector

36
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:06,561
who will enjoy not opening it.

37
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:09,041
- So sorry.
- Damn you, Mother.

38
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:10,536
I haven't been
this angry with you

39
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:12,262
since you enlisted me
in the Marines.

40
00:02:12,436 --> 00:02:15,874
Your draft number was too high.
The suspense was killing me.

41
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:27,712
Who's the new guy?

42
00:02:30,802 --> 00:02:32,717
A saxophone.

43
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:35,067
I wouldn't kick him
out of the library

44
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:36,852
for ignoring my shush.

45
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:38,767
Could he be any cooler?

46
00:02:41,117 --> 00:02:43,250
Oh, I'm gushing in the key of

47
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:44,903
E...!

48
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:48,559
Okay, don't gaze at his eyes.

49
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:50,779
Don't stare at his smile.

50
00:02:50,953 --> 00:02:52,607
Don't talk out loud.

51
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:54,783
You know, I can hear you.

52
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:56,480
Settle, children, settle.

53
00:02:56,654 --> 00:02:58,134
First, we have
a new band member.

54
00:02:58,308 --> 00:03:00,136
Blake, raise your hand.

55
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,866
Second, we're having
a chair challenge tomorrow.

56
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,390
Lisa Simpson will be playing
to retain her seat.

57
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:08,566
Your challenger is Blake.

58
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,091
Full disclosure,
I'm pretty good.

59
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:13,199
Well, I'm happy, 'cause
whether I beat you or not,

60
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:15,834
I'll get to sit next to you.

61
00:03:16,008 --> 00:03:18,837
Stop with the blue eyes,
will you?

62
00:03:19,011 --> 00:03:21,188
Less meet-cute, more toot-toot.

63
00:03:25,017 --> 00:03:26,671
Great. Now, keep playing.

64
00:03:26,845 --> 00:03:29,085
I have a very important meeting
in the instrument closet.

65
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,026
CBD gummies, take me away.

66
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:45,013
You come to me on the hay
of my daughter's bedding

67
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:48,084
and make me an ostrich
I can't refuse.

68
00:03:48,258 --> 00:03:49,564
Who are you?

69
00:03:49,738 --> 00:03:50,738
I'm Phil,

70
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:52,262
filling in for Comic Book Guy.

71
00:03:52,436 --> 00:03:53,761
Also known as

72
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:56,179
the Snark Knight
and Mean Lantern.

73
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:58,138
Stop being weird.

74
00:03:58,312 --> 00:04:00,420
I'm not being weird.
I'm a voice-over artist.

75
00:04:00,444 --> 00:04:02,272
I do voices for
your favorite cartoons.

76
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:04,013
Like Itchy the mouse.

77
00:04:05,754 --> 00:04:08,887
I never dreamed
real people did those voices.

78
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:11,107
I'm a little embarrassed
to say this,

79
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:13,762
but I do voices too.

80
00:04:13,936 --> 00:04:16,373
- Like who?
- Like this kid Nelson.

81
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,375
You don't know him,
but he's all...

82
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,700
Haw-haw,

83
00:04:19,724 --> 00:04:21,639
and, smell you later.

84
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:23,728
Haw-haw!

85
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:25,730
Smell you later.

86
00:04:25,904 --> 00:04:27,384
Hey, you're pretty good.

87
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,430
And I do an awesome
Todd Flanders,

88
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:31,204
but it's not worth
meeting Todd Flanders.

89
00:04:31,345 --> 00:04:33,434
- Do some more.
- Well, how about...

90
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:35,934
that guy from
Back to the Future.

91
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:39,309
Kid, we've got to help
your parents have sex.

92
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:41,113
- Do another.
- All right.

93
00:04:41,137 --> 00:04:44,140
I'll do Michael bloody Caine,
if you don't mind.

94
00:04:44,314 --> 00:04:46,447
If you want to live
in my cider house,

95
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:48,840
there are some rules!

96
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:53,149
Wow, if I knew who that was,
I would be even more impressed.

97
00:04:55,847 --> 00:04:58,633
Do you ever worry
that Lisa tries too hard

98
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:00,809
and Bart doesn't try enough?

99
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:02,463
Marge, you know our deal.

100
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:04,943
We don't mention the kids
after 7:00.

101
00:05:05,117 --> 00:05:06,510
Where is Bart anyway?

102
00:05:06,684 --> 00:05:08,469
He should have been home by now.

103
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:10,055
Can you call him?
I've got to get started

104
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,863
on second dinner.

105
00:05:12,037 --> 00:05:13,778
Boy, where are you?

106
00:05:13,952 --> 00:05:15,171
I'm hanging with a stranger.

107
00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:17,869
He's got so many
different personalities.

108
00:05:18,043 --> 00:05:19,828
Oh, will you be home
before dark, yes or no?

109
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:21,525
What am I, a Magic 8-Ball?

110
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:23,092
Sounds great.

111
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:26,008
Looks like all of us
are living the dream.

112
00:05:51,076 --> 00:05:53,490
Folks, we'll be landing
in San Diego soon.

113
00:05:53,514 --> 00:05:55,864
On the right side you can see
the Pacific Ocean,

114
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:59,041
and on the left, I think
there's Superman flying

115
00:05:59,215 --> 00:06:00,347
right behind us.

116
00:06:00,521 --> 00:06:04,481
Oh, don't patronize us, please.

117
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,272
- Working on questions to ask at the panels?
- Yes.

118
00:06:12,446 --> 00:06:15,927
Well, I've been going since '75.
Seen it all.

119
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:19,888
Adam West in shorts, a line
to meet Brendan Fraser.

120
00:06:20,062 --> 00:06:22,630
But you know the most amazing
thing I ever saw?

121
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:26,851
- What?
- Once, a guy asked a question so good,

122
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:29,767
he got a job with Marvel
on the spot.

123
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:32,030
Ooh, me write for Marvel?

124
00:06:32,204 --> 00:06:33,924
Be a part of the committee
that would decide

125
00:06:34,076 --> 00:06:35,860
the fate of the Avengers?

126
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:38,123
Then people like me
could make fun of me.

127
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,474
But those ain't gonna
cut it, fanboy.

128
00:06:40,648 --> 00:06:44,042
Then I will write
the best question ever.

129
00:06:44,216 --> 00:06:46,088
Was he real or...

130
00:06:46,262 --> 00:06:47,872
Of course I'm real,
and a real person

131
00:06:48,046 --> 00:06:50,571
should never be booked
between you and this guy.

132
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:52,224
I am Groot.

133
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,878
Kosher meal for Steve Fishbein.

134
00:06:54,052 --> 00:06:55,227
I am Steve Fishbein.

135
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,886
Comicalooza, even more glorious
than I dreamed.

136
00:07:06,282 --> 00:07:09,503
I should not have done that.
Very stupid.

137
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:12,941
Every man a Batman,
every woman a Harley Quinn.

138
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:20,514
The chance to rub elbows
with the who's who of Dr. Who.

139
00:07:20,688 --> 00:07:23,908
And to ride an escalator
next to Ant-Man Paul Rudd!

140
00:07:24,082 --> 00:07:26,084
You are Ant-Man Paul Rudd.

141
00:07:26,258 --> 00:07:30,611
Oh, God, I hate my
approachable everyman looks.

142
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:32,961
Yes, a question, please,
from someone who is

143
00:07:33,135 --> 00:07:34,441
still willing to become a fan.

144
00:07:34,615 --> 00:07:36,486
If you had access
to an Avengers-style

145
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,967
quantum time loop,
would you go back in time

146
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:41,665
and not be in
Dinner for Schmucks?

147
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,232
Activate VIP pass.

148
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:47,628
For two seconds I saw
inside the VIP room.

149
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:49,630
I saw Jon Favreau
sniffing hummus

150
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:51,283
to see if it was still good.

151
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,461
Time for a celebratory pretzel.

152
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:57,115
Rib-it, rib-it.

153
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:59,291
Who are you?

154
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:01,337
Boba Fett on a job interview.

155
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:04,427
Well, begone. I'm writing
the perfect panel question.

156
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:06,429
Get out of here.

157
00:08:08,518 --> 00:08:10,215
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I have it.

158
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:20,008
I will work for Marvel,

159
00:08:20,182 --> 00:08:22,967
and they will finally
be successful.

160
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:24,839
Hey, good question.

161
00:08:25,013 --> 00:08:26,318
Thank you, Professor X.

162
00:08:26,493 --> 00:08:28,146
I'm not Professor X.

163
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,671
I am just a bald man
in a wheelchair

164
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:33,674
searching for his child.

165
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:36,198
- Hey, Lisa.
- Oh, hey, Blake.

166
00:08:36,372 --> 00:08:38,896
This is where I eat
when I want to be alone.

167
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,768
I don't want
to be alone, though.

168
00:08:40,942 --> 00:08:44,162
Want to share wasabi peas?
They're really dry.

169
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:45,337
Are you a veggie?

170
00:08:45,512 --> 00:08:47,209
- Yes, I am.
- Me too.

171
00:08:47,383 --> 00:08:51,213
This is a BLT,
bread, lettuce and tomato.

172
00:08:51,387 --> 00:08:53,650
Hey, quit talking
to my girlfriend.

173
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,000
I am not your girlfriend.

174
00:08:56,174 --> 00:08:57,741
Right, right.
We're focused on

175
00:08:57,915 --> 00:09:00,178
career days and homework
right now.

176
00:09:00,352 --> 00:09:03,225
- But love has a way of...
- Get away from me.

177
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:07,011
Oh, my God, Lisa,
we've become my parents.

178
00:09:07,185 --> 00:09:09,840
Well, I just wanted to
wish you good luck and...

179
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:37,520
Ah, my favorite sound, silence.

180
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:39,914
See ya.

181
00:09:57,975 --> 00:10:00,412
Okay, a little bigger
than I thought.

182
00:10:00,587 --> 00:10:03,111
Oh, boy, it's like
Burning Man for nerds, although

183
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:06,114
to be fair, Burning Man is also
Burning Man for nerds.

184
00:10:06,288 --> 00:10:08,072
Man, there's a lot of nerds.

185
00:10:08,246 --> 00:10:09,900
Hello, Hall H.

186
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:13,425
Let's let out a roar
they can hear in Asgard.

187
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,776
Question, isn't sound
to Asgard blocked

188
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,386
by the vacuum of space?

189
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,607
Actually, sound is transmitted
by Yggdrasil,

190
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:22,913
the tree that connects the
nine worlds of the cosmos.

191
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:24,456
But transmission doesn't
come into it.

192
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,003
This has never not been true.

193
00:10:26,177 --> 00:10:29,267
Have you ever read Thor?

194
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:32,009
Wha... What?

195
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:34,795
We have some of the greatest
creators in the industry here.

196
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:37,972
Daniel Kim, Zoe Burwell,

197
00:10:38,146 --> 00:10:39,843
and David Z. Cohen!

198
00:10:43,151 --> 00:10:44,824
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God!

199
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:47,111
I've been blocked on Twitter
by all of them.

200
00:10:47,285 --> 00:10:51,507
And now it's time for...
audience questions.

201
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:56,381
Yes. Third position.

202
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,470
Time to prepare.
And just two steps to the mic.

203
00:10:58,645 --> 00:11:00,081
It's perfect.

204
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:02,953
I'd like to ask,
how would someone like me

205
00:11:03,127 --> 00:11:06,000
get someone like you
to look at my work?

206
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:07,349
I'll look at your work.

207
00:11:07,523 --> 00:11:10,004
Actually, I don't...

208
00:11:10,178 --> 00:11:12,833
I don't have any work, per se.

209
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:14,835
Next.

210
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,663
Closer to me. Closer to me.

211
00:11:20,057 --> 00:11:21,842
Isn't it true
that Superman represented

212
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:24,845
the subconscious desire
of creators Jerry Siegel

213
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:29,066
and Joe Shuster to defeat
the Nazi menace in 1938?

214
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:32,715
I have never heard
a question that good.

215
00:11:35,377 --> 00:11:36,813
Oh, yes, yes, good question.

216
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,860
And I believe the answer
is a-doy.

217
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:43,515
And now for the query
that will blow them away.

218
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,605
Where's my question?

219
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,563
Did I use it as a napkin?

220
00:11:47,737 --> 00:11:50,087
No, I never use a napkin.
Where is it?

221
00:11:50,261 --> 00:11:52,524
Next!

222
00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:54,744
Yes, my question is...

223
00:11:54,918 --> 00:11:57,312
Okay, I forgot my question.

224
00:11:57,486 --> 00:12:00,228
Worst question ever.

225
00:12:00,402 --> 00:12:02,709
No!

226
00:12:02,883 --> 00:12:04,885
Welcome to Marvel.

227
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,104
No.

228
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:09,890
We could offer you a job at DC.

229
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:11,805
Yes, hard pass.

230
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:14,546
Just when I thought this
day could not get any worse.

231
00:12:16,592 --> 00:12:20,465
Okay, the day you've been
waiting for, chair challenges.

232
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,599
We begin with Ralph
challenging for first triangle.

233
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:27,081
I'm halfway through.

234
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:30,780
Once again, first triangle
will be an empty chair.

235
00:12:30,954 --> 00:12:32,913
The better chair won.

236
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:35,785
Now, for first saxophone,
Lisa Simpson.

237
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:38,440
Hey, vegetarian,
I soaked your reed

238
00:12:38,614 --> 00:12:39,746
in hot dog water.

239
00:12:43,358 --> 00:12:45,795
Terrible. Blake?

240
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:48,450
Terrible, but better.

241
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:50,278
You're first chair.

242
00:12:50,452 --> 00:12:52,933
You were playing me
the whole time.

243
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,067
Don't you walk away from me.

244
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:59,766
Well, very soon,
I will outplay you,

245
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,942
my blues will be blue-ier,

246
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:03,944
my Baker Street
will be more baked,

247
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:05,902
and I will get my chair back.

248
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,470
It may not be today,
or tomorrow,

249
00:13:08,644 --> 00:13:10,820
because tomorrow
we have a field trip,

250
00:13:10,994 --> 00:13:13,954
or two days after that
because that's...

251
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:17,305
that's no school,
but on the 11th.

252
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:19,916
Yeah, the 11th,
it's mine, buddy.

253
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,309
That's the science fair.

254
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:23,441
Thanks for reminding me!

255
00:13:26,444 --> 00:13:29,273
Okay, audition for King
of Cookie Castle, take one.

256
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:31,841
Okay, you got this, Phil.
Book it, book it good.

257
00:13:32,015 --> 00:13:34,365
- We ready?
- Off with their heads.

258
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:35,976
Off with their feet.

259
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:39,022
Grind the rest
into a sugary treat.

260
00:13:39,196 --> 00:13:41,329
Beautiful, you got the part.

261
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,810
Beautiful, you got the fart.

262
00:13:43,984 --> 00:13:46,203
Hey, the kid's not bad.

263
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:47,988
We might have
a part for him too.

264
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:51,339
And if he improvises like that,
I can fire the writers.

265
00:13:51,513 --> 00:13:52,949
Read this, kid.

266
00:13:53,994 --> 00:13:55,865
Eat my tights.

267
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,519
You're hired.

268
00:13:57,693 --> 00:14:00,522
Who knew it was so easy
to become a working actor?

269
00:14:02,393 --> 00:14:04,874
Okay, everyone say one thing
they did today.

270
00:14:05,048 --> 00:14:06,223
I'll start.

271
00:14:06,397 --> 00:14:08,312
I lost my half-cup
measuring cup,

272
00:14:08,486 --> 00:14:09,879
so I used two quarter cups.

273
00:14:10,053 --> 00:14:11,707
Crisis averted.

274
00:14:11,881 --> 00:14:13,990
I booked a voice-over job,
and the show airs tomorrow.

275
00:14:14,014 --> 00:14:16,016
I thought animation
took nine months.

276
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,496
No, you can do any cartoon
in a day.

277
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,543
Anyone who takes longer is just
trying to bleed the studio dry.

278
00:14:21,717 --> 00:14:23,980
And this is what
they're paying me.

279
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,721
That's baloney.

280
00:14:25,895 --> 00:14:27,810
Anybody could fake
a check from...

281
00:14:27,984 --> 00:14:30,160
Warner Bros. Animation.

282
00:14:30,334 --> 00:14:31,901
No, it's legit.

283
00:14:32,075 --> 00:14:34,861
I made more in a minute
than you do in a month, fatso.

284
00:14:35,035 --> 00:14:36,776
Why, you little...

285
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,647
Keep your hands
off the moneymaker.

286
00:14:38,821 --> 00:14:40,059
And don't look me in the voice.

287
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:43,434
Lisa, how was your day?

288
00:14:43,608 --> 00:14:45,872
Well, my life is in ruin,

289
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:48,875
and I'm trying to think of some
possible plan to rescue myself.

290
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:50,441
Plans are fine,

291
00:14:50,615 --> 00:14:53,357
but never underestimate
the power of giving up.

292
00:14:53,531 --> 00:14:57,100
Because if you think about it,
see, spontan...

293
00:14:57,274 --> 00:14:58,754
Forget it.

294
00:14:58,928 --> 00:15:01,409
Coming up, Cookie Castle,

295
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,585
introducing Bart Simpson.

296
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:06,240
Oh, I still think
we all could have fit.

297
00:15:06,414 --> 00:15:07,719
Now get a good look.

298
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:09,678
This is your last chance
to see normal Bart

299
00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:12,463
before I become a star.

300
00:15:12,637 --> 00:15:15,249
Then I'll be the guy who sells
you out with a tell-all book.

301
00:15:15,423 --> 00:15:16,903
Boo-yeah.

302
00:15:23,561 --> 00:15:24,954
Yeah, go, Bart.

303
00:15:25,128 --> 00:15:27,783
You got the "and" credit.

304
00:15:27,957 --> 00:15:31,961
I negotiated that, in lieu
of having a teacher on set. Bam.

305
00:15:35,922 --> 00:15:40,100
I kneel before you, Jules.

306
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:41,928
Rise, sir knight,

307
00:15:42,102 --> 00:15:45,061
and kiss the gentle hand
of your sovereign.

308
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,628
You play a girl?

309
00:15:46,802 --> 00:15:47,977
Come on.

310
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:50,414
They didn't tell me that.

311
00:15:50,588 --> 00:15:52,677
My place is in the scullery.

312
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:56,812
I thought "scullery"
was where they kept the skulls.

313
00:15:56,986 --> 00:16:00,337
Bart plays a girl,
Bart plays a girl.

314
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,949
And his accent's inconsistent.

315
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,793
Bart?

316
00:16:21,968 --> 00:16:22,969
Go away.

317
00:16:23,143 --> 00:16:25,232
No, I'm not gonna tease you.

318
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:28,322
I'm proud that my brother isn't
bound by gender stereotypes

319
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:30,977
or heteronormative thinking.

320
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:33,370
I hate the way
your generation talks.

321
00:16:33,544 --> 00:16:35,198
I have something to tell you.

322
00:16:35,372 --> 00:16:37,984
Oh, don't tell me I'm nominated
for an Annie Award.

323
00:16:38,158 --> 00:16:41,161
- Those things are worthless.
- Much more important.

324
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:43,554
For my problem,
there's no answer.

325
00:16:43,728 --> 00:16:47,384
But what you're doing is brave,
and it's a little dangerous,

326
00:16:47,558 --> 00:16:48,777
and you should be proud.

327
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:49,951
Really?

328
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,693
That's right, my friend.

329
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:54,565
You should walk into school
with your head held high.

330
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:56,741
All right, I will.

331
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,179
Hey, everyone,
I'm Princess Jules

332
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,050
and I'm proud.

333
00:17:01,224 --> 00:17:02,486
One question.

334
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,315
Do you identify
as him or her?

335
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:07,013
- Him.
- Get him!

336
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:14,934
You're not
gonna yell at me?

337
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:18,372
No. I have lost my will
to berate.

338
00:17:18,546 --> 00:17:19,982
I'm sorry.

339
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:23,029
Ralph Wiggum feels sorry for me.

340
00:17:23,203 --> 00:17:25,553
And farther still do I fall.

341
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:27,903
This will be here for me later.

342
00:17:28,077 --> 00:17:31,385
Leave me alone.
Get out of here, you stupid kid.

343
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,561
You're like a Gollum
with worse hair,

344
00:17:33,735 --> 00:17:36,085
a subcommittee meeting
of the Galactic Senate,

345
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:39,828
a Spider-Man drawn
by John Romita Jr. Jr.

346
00:17:40,002 --> 00:17:42,352
You fixed me.

347
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:45,312
You fixed me.

348
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:49,229
Let's see, where could I move?

349
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,319
Toluca Lake.
Lot of voice-over work there.

350
00:17:52,493 --> 00:17:54,712
It would be nice
to fly in and out of Burbank.

351
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,933
Bart, turn on your show.

352
00:17:58,107 --> 00:17:59,935
You mean the show
that ruined my life?

353
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:02,938
Just turn it on.
You're not a princess anymore.

354
00:18:03,112 --> 00:18:05,027
You're a queen.

355
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:06,724
Majesty,

356
00:18:06,898 --> 00:18:09,901
the royal unicorn is waiting
for your dainty bottom.

357
00:18:10,076 --> 00:18:11,468
Aw, geez.

358
00:18:20,086 --> 00:18:23,306
Who knew a princess
could be badass?

359
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,961
I'm gonna get a Queen Bart
action figure.

360
00:18:26,135 --> 00:18:29,269
The unicorn's killed
every adult in sight.

361
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,939
From now on, hands off Bart.

362
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,464
What about me?

363
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:53,467
I like the bullying.
It's a form of attention.

364
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:56,426
Also, hands off Milhouse.

365
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,906
No.

366
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,734
Well,

367
00:18:59,908 --> 00:19:03,172
I can't play to my abilities
or in a stupid first chair,

368
00:19:03,346 --> 00:19:05,957
but I can still just play
for the fun of it.

369
00:19:06,132 --> 00:19:08,221
Beat it. This is our turf.

370
00:19:34,334 --> 00:19:35,813
Free pretzel?

371
00:19:35,987 --> 00:19:37,989
The greatest award
I've ever won.

372
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:42,733
Still up there.

373
00:19:42,907 --> 00:19:45,649
Although Dad ate
the original pretzel.

374
00:19:45,823 --> 00:19:47,825
Stick it on the tray.

375
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:49,131
No.

376
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:55,107
I'm addicted
to playing for free.

377
00:19:55,182 --> 00:19:58,575
Which is the least dangerous
addiction a musician can have.

378
00:20:05,365 --> 00:20:07,323
I want to like it. I just don't.

379
00:20:15,636 --> 00:20:18,378
If you could go back in time
and not make one Hulk movie,

380
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:22,556
which would it be and why?

381
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,948
The most popular superheroes

382
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,403
are Superman, Batman,
Spider-Man,

383
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:29,911
so I propose creating
SuperSpiderBat.

384
00:20:30,085 --> 00:20:32,914
Why do people who see Superman
first think it's a bird?

385
00:20:33,088 --> 00:20:35,395
And why do they feel
the need to say it out loud?

386
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,920
Look, it's a bird.
I mean, who says that?

387
00:20:44,752 --> 00:20:47,320
<i>Any note you can reach,
I can go higher</i>

388
00:20:47,494 --> 00:20:50,018
<i>I can sing anything
higher than you</i>

389
00:20:50,192 --> 00:20:52,673
<i>- No, you can't, no, you can't
- Yes, I can</i>

390
00:20:52,847 --> 00:20:55,371
<i>- Yes, I can, yes, I can
- No, you can't</i>

391
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,026
<i>- No, you can't, no, you can't
- Yes, I can</i>

392
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,681
<i>- Yes, I can, yes, I can
- No, you can't</i>

393
00:21:00,855 --> 00:21:03,379
<i>- No, you can't, no, you can't
- Yes, I can</i>

394
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,034
<i>- Yes, I can, yes, I can
- No, you can't</i>

395
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,689
<i>- No, you can't, no, you can't
- Yes, I can</i>

396
00:21:08,863 --> 00:21:11,170
<i>- Yes, I can, yes, I can
- No, you can't</i>

397
00:21:11,344 --> 00:21:13,259
<i>No, you can't</i>

398
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:16,265
All right, I can't.
Big whoop.
