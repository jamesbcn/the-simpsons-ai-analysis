00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,124
- [watch beeps]
- We rule. Over.

170
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,585
Roger that. Over.

171
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,963
Inappropriate billboard
near Noiseland Arcade.

172
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:30,425
Guaranteed danger of corruption.
Keep children away.

173
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,468
[phone chimes]

174
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,636
Hmm. Whoa. Whoa.

175
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,140
Thanks for warning us
about the vulgar wordplay, Simp.

176
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,184
"Itch, please."

177
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,812
Wait, I get it. Itch rhymes with bi...
[mumbling]

178
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,274
No. Mom hates that word. Trust me.

179
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,362
One more post and I'll be top five.

180
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,321
Homer.

181
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,533
Religious fanatic running through town,
possibly from murder scene.

182
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,909
Avoid outdoors.

183
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,202
[phone beeps]

184
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,286
I did it.

185
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,373
- [yelping] Fanatic!
- I'm number five.

186
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,667
I'm better than everyone.

187
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,254
[static crackles]

188
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,422
[Frink] <i>Uh-uh-uh, your name is not Frink.</i>

189
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,217
<i>You are Frink's monster, you see?</i>

190
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,303
[Frink's monster groans] <i>Frink sad.</i>

191
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:19,015
[Frink] <i>No, Frink's monster is sad.
What is wrong with you?</i>

192
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,643
[Moe] <i>All right, one of youse rats
has been eating the pool chalk</i>

193
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,104
<i>and leaving chalky pellets
all over the place.</i>

194
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,398
<i>No, no, don't look at each other.
Look at me!</i>

195
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,650
<i>Hey! Steve.</i>

196
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,568
[Ned] <i>Oh. Hey, Marge.</i>

197
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,652
[Marge] <i>Hi, Ned.</i>

198
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,112
Ooh, that's Mom.

199
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,905
<i>What a party yesterday.</i>

200
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,866
<i>I don't usually take my water
on the rocks.</i>

201
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,285
<i>I was buzzing all night.</i>

202
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,579
<i>Yeah, it was fun.</i>

203
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,164
- [sobbing]
- [Lisa] Oh.

204
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:46,876
<i>Whoa. I didn't mean to bring on
a peeper-puddle. What's wrong?</i>

205
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,211
[Marge] <i>It's silly. I...</i>

206
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:52,716
<i>I'm embarrassed that my feelings were hurt
by a stupid birthday gift.</i>

207
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,302
[Ned] <i>Oh, now, feelings aren't stupid.</i>

208
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,596
<i>Some of them are evil,
but they're not stupid.</i>

209
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:02,142
<i>It's just on my one day,
I'm barely an afterthought.</i>

210
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,270
<i>It's like they don't think of me
as a person.</i>

211
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,480
[sighs]

212
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:07,982
[eavesdropper clicks]

213
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,442
I don't get it. Why is she so sad?

214
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,069
Bart, she's feeling unseen.

215
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,487
What? I always see her.

216
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:18,491
She's in my phone contacts three times,
under Mom, Mommy and Sandwich.

217
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:21,786
She does so many things
that we take for granted.

218
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:26,833
Imagine how we would feel
if she half-tushied our birthdays.

219
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,836
What? I'd be fine if she only...

220
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,172
[groans]

221
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,424
[sighing] Oh.

222
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,925
- [watch beeps]
- We suck. Over.

223
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,677
Roger that. Over.

224
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,762
[watch beeps]

225
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,347
As of this morning,

226
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,725
I am number one on the leaderboard
of the Alarmist App.

227
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,268
[gasps] Look at that.

228
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,270
What? The broken sprinkler?

229
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,563
We need to warn people.

230
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,941
It could cause a sinkhole
or activate a gremlin.

231
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,027
This is your Number One Alarmy,

232
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,364
with a warning that a geyser of water
is pouring onto...

233
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,448
- [phone beeps]
- Huh?

234
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:04,788
Hey, someone named Silver Bullet already
reported a "vertical tsunami at the park."

235
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,123
Whoa, that's good mongering.

236
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,291
I got scooped?

237
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,002
Silver Bullet is now Alarmy Number One.

238
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,921
What? Who is this guy?

239
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,883
Those fat fingers are too slow
for the Silver Bullet.

240
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,135
Silver Bullet, your days are numbered.

241
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,305
Tell me something my doctor hasn't.

242
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,224
You smell like old lady.

243
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,017
So do you.

244
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,604
I smell like a lot of things.

245
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,440
We have to get Mom a new present.
Something meaningful.

246
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:36,361
So, let's make a list of everything
we know about Mom.

247
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,072
Yes. Great idea.

248
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,032
[Lisa] Mmm.

249
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,743
Hmm. Her first name is actually Margaret.

250
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,954
Good. Write that down.

251
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,580
[Bart] Hmm.

252
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,416
Ooh, I know.

253
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,085
She loves coming to my jazz recitals.

254
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:56,089
Uh, no, she doesn't. She hides a copy
of <i>People</i> magazine in the program.

255
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,716
Oh. [groans]

256
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,093
Why is this so hard?

257
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,846
We should know
the woman who gave birth to us.

258
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,389
Maybe she's unknowable.

259
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,307
What if we just give her the spy kit

260
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,852
and breakfast in bed
for the rest of her life?

261
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:13,356
Or, you know that trunk where
Mom keeps all her memories and stuff?

262
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:17,110
What if we use the spy kit
to break into it?

263
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,947
Oh, welcome to the dark side.

264
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,701
{\an8}[Lisa] Huh.

265
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,453
[gasps] Here we are.

266
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,498
I don't know if these lock picking tools
are even gonna work.

267
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,960
- I mean, this is just a toy, and...
- [lock clicks]

268
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,837
[gasps] Oh.

269
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,674
Now I'm concerned
about those gummy cyanide capsules.

270
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,718
Mom's birth announcement.

271
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:45,597
Oh, her name is Marjorie. Not Margaret.

272
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,142
We officially know nothing about her.

273
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,685
[Lisa] Hmm.

274
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,855
Mom had a parrot named Petey?

275
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,319
Oh, they were best friends.
Like me and Santa's Little Helper.

276
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,528
[dog whines]

277
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,614
Not now, boy. Busy.

278
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,115
[gasps] Look at this one.

279
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,535
[Bart groans] Mom's parents
must've given Petey away.

280
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:11,289
Hey, we just learned something about her.
Grandma was a jerk-ass.

281
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,708
Wait. Parrots live for, like, 80 years.

282
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,502
Maybe we could find Petey

283
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,630
and then reunite Mom
with her long-lost friend.

284
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,133
That would be like getting her a robe
that tells you it wants crackers.

285
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,510
How do we find this lady?

286
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,054
[Lisa] Well, we need to go
to North Townsburg.

287
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,014
Oh, that place is sketchy.

288
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:31,059
Milhouse's dad was a sign spinner
for a meth clinic there.

289
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,603
But let's do it. For Margotie!

290
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,729
Marjorie.

291
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,815
Whatever.

292
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,444
[groans] Townsburg is three hours away?

293
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,529
Fine.

294
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,865
I'll just kick the seat in front of me
until that little screw falls out.

295
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,577
- [grunting]
- That is so rude.

296
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,414
Well, you have to kick closer to the screw
like this.

297
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,083
[grunting]

298
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,877
[Chalmers grunts] Great.

299
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,714
[both groaning]

300
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,593
[groans] This place is depressing.

301
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,846
Isn't that the corner
where Nic Cage went crazy?

302
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,640
Yep, there's the statue.

303
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,310
[gasps] There's the mechanic's shop.

304
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,145
Let's do this.

305
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,482
Hey, grease stains. Seen this bird?

306
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,526
{\an8}Yeah, I remember him.
That's Krista's bird.

307
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,069
{\an8}He in some kind of trouble?

308
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,571
We'll ask the questions.

309
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,240
What's the skinny
on this Krista character?

310
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,284
Well, she owns the craft store
down the block.

311
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,994
She also sells liquor and weed.

312
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,745
- Let's go.
- Don't leave town.

313
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,747
But my niece's wedding is tomorrow.

314
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,916
{\an8}I said, don't leave town.

315
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,001
{\an8}Fine.

316
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,879
{\an8}Hey, Shirl, it's Vince. I can't make it.

317
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,090
I don't know. Some kid told me
I can't leave town.

318
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,551
I gotta get back to being
Alarmy Number One.

319
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,681
Gotta warn people about... [groans]
...something. [gasps]

320
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,016
Death from above.

321
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,478
Falling branches in Springfield Park.
Stay away!

322
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,229
[phone beeps]

323
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,607
- My God, we have to get out of here.
- I did it!

324
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,358
- [Martin] What? [yelps]
- I'm Alarmy Number One.

325
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,528
Not for long, you toad-faced beanbag.

326
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:10,033
I will cut you into tiny pieces
like my son's pancakes.

327
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:14,663
I'm gonna eat you up and crap you out
like my son's pancakes.

328
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,500
The air at Springfield Park
is full of pollen.

329
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,211
Individuals with lungs
should avoid the area.

330
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,380
[Homer groans]

331
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,758
Lifeless bodies at the park.
Possible gas leak.

332
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,510
Demented man throwing objects
at the duck pond.

333
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,512
Chemical air attack at the play yard!

334
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,640
UFOs hovering over picnic area.

335
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,935
String-guided dragons,
most likely time travelers, attack...

336
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,354
I saw the kites first, you big galoot!

337
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,689
- [rumbling]
- [both scream]

338
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,316
Wh... What happened?

339
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,319
Ugh, the earth couldn't support
your giant ass.

340
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,156
Maybe Satan heard your voice
and decided to fast-track you to hell.

341
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,450
Okay, we both got one in.

342
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,702
How are we getting out of this sinkhole?

343
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,955
I dropped my phone. Do you have yours?

344
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,999
No, just start shouting.
Someone will hear us.

345
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,795
- Help! Save me, not her!
- Down here!

346
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,630
[passenger] Hurry. The dragons are coming.

347
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,756
[tires squealing]

348
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:10,134
Oh, yeah, Petey. He was smart as a whip.

349
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,552
Could imitate anything:

350
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,262
political figures of the day,

351
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,974
the "You Lose" horn from <i>Price Is Right</i>.

352
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,602
So many times, I thought contestants lost
when they hadn't.

353
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,939
Why are you talking about him
in the past tense?

354
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,317
Oh, I left his cage open by mistake
and he flew away.

355
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,362
Last I heard,
he joined a flock of wild parrots.

356
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,991
Oh, I guess we came
all this way for nothing.

357
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,367
Stay in town.

358
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,787
But my daughter's wedding is... [sighs]

359
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,580
Shirl. Bad news.

360
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,083
We failed Mom again.

361
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,377
We are losers.

362
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,922
[parrot imitating "You Lose" horn]

363
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,590
Bart, it's Petey.

364
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,427
- How can we lure him down here?
- Uh. Uh.

365
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,636
[gasps] I've got it.

366
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,056
[Marge] <i>Bart,
are you secretly recording me?</i>

367
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,850
<i>I'm on hold to talk about our water bill.</i>

368
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,893
<i>I-I'm sorry. No, I'm not talking to you.</i>

369
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,021
<i>I'm talking to my annoying son.</i>

370
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,564
- [grunts] Got him!
- [Bart] Yes!

371
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,898
[Petey] Annoying son.

372
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,233
[Agnes] Hello?

373
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,777
Can't any of you idiots hear us?

374
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,905
There's no one to save us.
We scared everyone away.

375
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,532
Isn't that ironic?

376
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,658
I guess.

377
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,077
No, I'm asking.
I don't know what ironic means.

378
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,246
Why did we get so crazy?

379
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,998
I was doing a public service.

380
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,084
I warned everyone that broken sprinkler
would cause a sinkhole.

381
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,169
Bull-scat.

382
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,047
You were trying to move up
the leaderboard. We both were.

383
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,132
Now we're stuck down here.

384
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,844
[sighs] I miss the surface world.

385
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,387
Hey, you gotta share that.

386
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,639
We both need strength to fight off CHUDs.

387
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,434
- Hell, no! My Werther's, my choice.
- [growls]

388
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,395
- Mmm.
- [Homer gasps, groans]

389
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,857
Yeah, yeah. You got candy in there.
Stop showing off.

390
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,442
- [chokes]
- Are you choking?

391
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,985
Hang on. I'll save you!

392
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,863
Wait. Is this irony?

393
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,614
Ow, ow!

394
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,908
Okay. I'm doing it. [grunts]

395
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,536
- [coughs, gasps] I can breathe.
- [sighs]

396
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:04,791
Simpson, instead of mongering fear,
you mongered...

397
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,876
Life itself.

398
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,961
Thank you.

399
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:13,132
[gasps] This is the feeling I was after,
not some stupid leaderboard.

400
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,717
I'm gonna help you get out of here.

401
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,011
Step in my hands. I'll boost you up.

402
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,138
[Agnes grunting]

403
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,558
- Oh. There's so much to grab onto.
- [Homer grunting]

404
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,355
I'll tell everyone you're down there,

405
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,358
which will make me Alarmy Number One.

406
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,567
Suck it.

407
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,904
Hairless ground hippo stuck in sinkhole.
And while...

408
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,281
She's horrible.

409
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,868
Mom, we have one more
birthday surprise for you.

410
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,370
Oh, really?

411
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,541
We tracked down your best friend.

412
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,417
Petey?

413
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,503
Petey.

414
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:54,048
How... How is this happening?
How is this happening?

415
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,342
How is this happening?

416
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,845
- [screaming, grunting]
- [Petey] How is this happening?

417
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,930
- Get it off! Get it off before he...
- How is this happening?

418
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,932
- [Marge] Oh. Ugh.
- [Lisa] Ew.

419
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,852
- Ow. [screaming]
- [Lisa] Bart, do something!

420
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:06,894
[Bart grunts]

421
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,147
- Sorry.
- We thought he loved you.

422
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:13,901
This is how he shows love.
By grooming me and regurgitating on me.

423
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,612
I could never have friends over.
He was so possessive...

424
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,864
[squawking] Mine!

425
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:23,537
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

426
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:25,955
[whistles]

427
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,166
[squawking]

428
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,792
So why did you even get him?

429
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,336
I didn't. I wanted a kitten.

430
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,547
Our neighbor was giving away their parrot.

431
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,676
Since Petey can meow,
my dad decided he was close enough.

432
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,844
Meow.

433
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,514
- You're nothing like a kitten! [gasps]
- [Petey screeches]

434
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,433
Don't worry.
We'll take him back to Townsburg.

435
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,018
He's part of a wild flock there.

436
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,687
You went all the way to Townsburg?

437
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:54,150
We wanted to get you something, you know,
personal for your birthday.

438
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,570
Yeah, we did not make friends
on the bus ride home.

439
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,197
Petey is kind of racist.

440
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,116
Well, that's just...

441
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,618
We're sorry.

442
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,788
We didn't mean to re-traumatize you
with your childhood nightmare bird.

443
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,374
My wonderful babies.

444
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,793
You went to all that trouble for me.

445
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:16,714
I wasn't an afterthought. I was a thought.

446
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:23,512
Well, yeah, 'cause, you know,
we see you as a person.

447
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,306
We really do.

448
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,683
[whimpering] Our favorite person.

449
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,019
Oh, that is so...

450
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,939
- [crunches]
- [screaming] Ow!

451
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,107
[groaning] You little... [grunts]

452
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:38,736
Who wants to help Mommy abandon Petey
in Townsburg?

453
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,197
- We do!
- We do!

454
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,290
[tires screeching]

455
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,376
[thuds]

456
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,710
{\an8}[chattering]

457
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,254
{\an8}[neighbor] Did anybody see what happened?

458
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,340
{\an8}Marge, what a beautiful robe.

459
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,133
{\an8}Is that terry cloth?

460
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:04,720
{\an8}French terry.
From the Terry province of France.

461
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,722
{\an8}- Wow.
- Oh, France.

462
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,224
{\an8}My kids got it for me.

463
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,227
{\an8}I just threw it on
to see what that noise was.

464
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,438
{\an8}I think it came from over there.

465
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,149
{\an8}Look at the fullness in that sleeve.

466
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,651
{\an8}What was that sound?

467
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,319
{\an8}I don't see anything.

468
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,864
{\an8}Meh. It's a mystery we may never know.

469
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,324
{\an8}- Look at how it moves.
- Poetry in fabric.

470
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,410
{\an8}[Bernice] You better work!

471
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,079
{\an8}- [beeping]
- [Bart laughs]

472
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,456
{\an8}Mission accomplished, over.

473
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,418
{\an8}[both] Roger that, over.

474
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,461
Shh!
