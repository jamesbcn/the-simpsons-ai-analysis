1
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:05,922
The Simpsons.

2
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,205
Ah... this place is going
to smell classy all week.

3
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,666
To Homer...
The Wall Street genius!

4
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,011
Hey, Homer,
how come you got

5
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,929
money to burn,
or singe anyway?

6
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,848
Yeah Homer,
what's your secret investment?

7
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,433
Take a guess.

8
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,851
Uh, pumpkins?

9
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,853
Yeah, that's right, Barney.

10
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,105
This year,
I invested in pumpkins.

11
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,608
They've been going up
the whole month of October,

12
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,151
and I got a feeling

13
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,862
they're going to peak
right around January

14
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,989
and, bang,
that's when I'll cash in.

15
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,450
To Homer, and to Sergeant Pepper

16
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,703
who is growing out of
the middle of your back.

17
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,456
Uh, Barn, you got
to unwrap the plastic

18
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,707
before you smoke these.

19
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,125
To Homer. Yeah!

20
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,669
Way to go, Homer!

21
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,633
Homer, you knuckle-beak,
I told you a hundred times

22
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,860
you got to sell
your pumpkin futures

23
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,552
before Halloween, before.

24
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,346
Alright, let's not panic.

25
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,823
I'll make the money back
by selling one of my livers.

26
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,390
I can get by with one.

27
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,644
Oh, how am I going
to tell Marge we're broke?

28
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,771
I need a miracle.

29
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,481
My house is on fire!

30
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,650
Whoo-hoo!
Insurance to the rescue!

31
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,322
Hello, Homer.

32
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,660
Marge, we had a deal.

33
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,303
Your sisters don't
come here after 6:00,

34
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,413
and I stop eating
your lipstick.

35
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,457
This is a special occasion.

36
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,793
Patty and Selma just got promoted
at the D.M.V.

37
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:07,877
Yeah, Homer.

38
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,464
Let your wife have
a glimpse of success for once.

39
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,966
All right.

40
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,676
That's the last straw.

41
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,138
Time to take out
the trash, but first

42
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,265
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

43
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,900
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,569
Homer doesn't
mean to be rude.

45
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,779
He's just a very
complicated man.

46
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:35,780
Wrong!

47
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,490
When are you
going to wake up

48
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,200
and smell your
husband, Marge?

49
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,369
Granted, you got
some kids out of him,

50
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,763
but when the seeds
have been planted,

51
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,205
you throw away
the envelope.

52
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,049
I wish you wouldn't put
Homer down like that.

53
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,834
He may not be a
big success like you,

54
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,586
but I can
always count on him

55
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,254
to provide for the family.

56
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:55,049
Oh, sweet, trusting Marge,
I can't let you down.

57
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,343
I'll get some money somehow.

58
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,139
Hello. Vegas?

59
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,183
Give me a hundred bucks on red.

60
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,102
D'oh! All right,
I'll send you a check.

61
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,982
If only I could think
of an invention.

62
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,817
Something that would
really make money.

63
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:16,029
Must concentrate and work harder
than I've ever worked...

64
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,828
Congratulations,
Mr. Simpson.

65
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,079
This invention of yours

66
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,874
has made us all rich,
especially you.

67
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,292
It's simple yet ingenious

68
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,461
and it fits right
in the palm of your hand.

69
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,630
Every person in America
now owns one of these

70
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,298
and in many cases,
three or four.

71
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,799
Could I just get
a look at that?

72
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,509
Why would you
need to see it?

73
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,054
You're the genius who invented
the product in question.

74
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,388
But, uh, could I just...

75
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,015
Now don't worry,
you'll get to see it

76
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,142
just as soon as we unveil
our new ad campaign.

77
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,604
Let me see! Let me see!
Out of the way!

78
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,522
Homer! Homer, wake up!

79
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,275
There's still a few minutes
till our usual bedtime.

80
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,652
Ooh, my invention!

81
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,654
All my money problems
could have...

82
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,030
Money problems?
Homer, are we

83
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,907
in some sort of
fiduciary trouble?

84
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,788
Oh, Marge,
my loyal wife,

85
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,915
of course not.

86
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:12,168
And Lisa, my
little princess.

87
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,921
And who could forget
dear Rat Boy?

88
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,047
Rat Boy? I resent that.

89
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,342
Bart, I told
you before...

90
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,135
Stop gnawing
on the drywall.

91
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,304
What a day,
eh, Milhouse?

92
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,265
The sun is out,
birds are singing.

93
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,267
Bees are trying to
have sex with them...

94
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,726
As is my understanding.

95
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,020
It is a gorgeously
fabulous day.

96
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,689
Marvelous even.

97
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,609
So, uh, what's your
hurry to get to school?

98
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,819
Nothing.

99
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,320
What's your hurry?

100
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,157
That's enough, Bart.

101
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,701
Fun is fun,
but if we're late,

102
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,928
we're going
to get in trouble.

103
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,453
You're right, Milhouse.

104
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,997
Fun is fun.

105
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,670
Attention, students.
It's time once again

106
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,231
to choose a gym class
for the coming term,

107
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,590
so let's all prove
how adult we can be

108
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,968
by filing to the gym
in a calm and orderly manner,

109
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,886
even though it's first come,
first serve,

110
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,570
and the most popular sports
fill up fast.

111
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,727
Too many wee ones!

112
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,689
This gets uglier every year.

113
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,566
Any sign of Bart and Milhouse?

114
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,443
No. And if they don't
get here soon,

115
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,236
it'll be T.S. for them.

116
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,991
I don't feel right.

117
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,660
Do you hear that, Bart?

118
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,370
That was the tardy bell.

119
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,664
"Truant! Truant! Truant!"
They'll all say.

120
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,125
Aw, who needs him?

121
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,418
I can have fun
all by myself.

122
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,586
S'all right?

123
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,837
S'all right.

124
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,088
S'all right?
S'all right.

125
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,506
S'all right?
S'all right.

126
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,762
Sure Homer, I can loan you
all the money you need.

127
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,723
However, since you
have no collateral,

128
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,726
I'm gonna have to break
your legs in advance.

129
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,644
Gosh, Moe, I use these
all the time.

130
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,646
Couldn't you just
bash my head in?

131
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,273
Hey, hey,
are you a loan shark?

132
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,359
Do you understand
how finance works?

133
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,485
Now, let's
do this thing.

134
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:08,951
Oh, no.

135
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,286
It's P.E. sign-up day.

136
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,621
How could you forget?

137
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,664
They had signs posted
all over the library.

138
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,750
Better sign up for
something fast, man.

139
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,668
Baseball just
filled up... Ow!

140
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,712
So did tae kwon do.

141
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,849
There's only one class left,

142
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,603
but it happens to be
the coolest one of all.

143
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,815
Ballet?
Dancing is for girls.

144
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,942
Well, you should have
gotten here earlier.

145
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:44,904
Uh, I need another extension
on my mortgage payments.

146
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,387
I understand that Mr. Simpson,
but according to our computer,

147
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,742
your credit history
is not good.

148
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,829
It says here that you've been
pre-declined for every major credit card.

149
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,540
It also says that you once
grabbed a dog by the hind legs

150
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,917
and pushed him around
like a vacuum cleaner.

151
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,120
That was in the third grade.

152
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,379
Well, it all goes
on your permanent record.

153
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,857
I'm sorry, but if you don't come up
with that money by tomorrow,

154
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,234
the bank is going
to take your house.

155
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,051
Well, good luck finding it

156
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,975
because I'm gonna take
the numbers off tonight.

157
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,930
Well, we'll look for the house
with no numbers.

158
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,075
Then I'll take off the numbers
on my neighbor's house.

159
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,144
So then we'll look for the house next
to the house with no numbers.

160
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,771
All right,
you'll get your money.

161
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,773
You're my last last chance...

162
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,483
Bottom-of-the-barrel, hail-mary,

163
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,652
longshot-wish-you-would-do-it
but-probably-won't

164
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,654
final resort to lend me money.

165
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:27,864
We'll take care of you.

166
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,615
Yes, care.

167
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,804
Cut him a check

168
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,598
and get him the
hell out of here.

169
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,814
What a wonderful dinner.
What a beautiful family.

170
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,192
Someone get a picture of me
with my arm around this steak.

171
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,919
You're certainly in a good
mood tonight, Dad.

172
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,570
Well, Lisa,

173
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,614
I managed to solve
a little problem today,

174
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:13,201
and to celebrate,
I'm going to tilt my chair.

175
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,954
Mmm, slanty.

176
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,708
Patty, Selma?
What are you doing here?

177
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,628
We thought we'd stop by
unexpectedly for dinner.

178
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,923
Now bring us some extra chairs
like a good blubber-in-law.

179
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,466
Time to fertilize the lawn.

180
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,552
A couple of 500-pound bags
should do it.

181
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,197
Homer, be careful with
my sisters' heads.

182
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,972
Their necks are brittle.

183
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,141
That's okay, Marge.
Nothing's broke...

184
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,726
Except Homer.

185
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,645
What's that supposed to mean?

186
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,897
It means...

187
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,691
It means these two
fabulous babes

188
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,401
are staying for dinner.

189
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,906
Now, there's a stink
I could have done without.

190
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,534
This has been such
a nice, peaceful dinner.

191
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,785
It calls for a celebration.

192
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,286
I'm going to make

193
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,372
the most international coffee
in the house...

194
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,457
Montreal Morn.

195
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:04,873
All right,
you had your fun.

196
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,254
Now get lost.

197
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,089
Oh, our fun
hasn't begun yet.

198
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:15,680
We know something you
don't want Marge to know.

199
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,473
Now we own you

200
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,017
like Siegfried owns Roy.

201
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,145
I'm sorry. All we have
is Nescafe.

202
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,481
I'm very, very sorry.

203
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,525
Oh, Marge, Marge.
You're just in time.

204
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,736
Homer's getting ready
to give us a foot rub.

205
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,737
You are?

206
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,657
No! I... uh...

207
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,202
I'm giving them
a foot massage.

208
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,121
At least let me
have that.

209
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,707
You can start
with the corns.

210
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,168
Then you can move on
to bunion country.

211
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,170
Okay. Steady, Bart.

212
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,716
Taking ballet doesn't
make you any less of a man.

213
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,930
All right, girls.

214
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,933
Today we learn the dance
of the fairy queens.

215
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,394
You can either be
a fairy or a queen.

216
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,770
It's wide open.

217
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,691
Ah, and what have we here?

218
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,736
A young man maybe who thinks
he can be the next Baryshnikov?

219
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,571
I don't want to be
the next anything.

220
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,823
I'm only taking this stupid
class because they made me.

221
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,658
So, he has fire in the belly.

222
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:21,495
But it will take more than belly
fire to be the next Baryshnikov.

223
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,956
Look, Boris, I think
ballet's for sissies.

224
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,978
Ballet is for the strong,
the fierce, the determined...

225
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,003
But for the sissies...

226
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,212
Never.

227
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,006
Now, put on this fuchsiatard.

228
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,966
You, are a fairy.

229
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,552
Quitting time.

230
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,928
Let's go Homer.
On the way home,

231
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,388
we're stopping at Moe's
for a Zima.

232
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,599
Maybe I'll just stay
and work overtime.

233
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,518
My sisters-in-law
are at my house again.

234
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,145
Homer, quit wallowing
in self-pity.

235
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,065
Pull yourself together
and come get drunk with us.

236
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,822
Is something wrong,
Mr. Simpson?

237
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,491
I don't like wearing
tights, ma'am.

238
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,369
But so many of your
heroes wear tights.

239
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,536
Batman, for example

240
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,622
and... Magellan.

241
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,558
Look, I don't like this cootie platoon
and I never will.

242
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,875
I'm out of here,

243
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,278
and I'm out
of this stupid outfit.

244
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,548
Wait.

245
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,342
Joy of movement increasing.

246
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,803
Love of dance,
impossible to resist.

247
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,348
Toes twinkling!

248
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,683
Look at me, girls.

249
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,226
I'm doing ballet!

250
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,436
And I love it!

251
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,273
Hmm. Am I wrong,

252
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,651
or did it just get fatter
in here?

253
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,361
Request permission
to slink by.

254
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,154
Permission pending.

255
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,489
First...

256
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,199
light our cigarettes.

257
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,867
But you're already
smoking cig...

258
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,039
You're really pushing it.

259
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,708
Come on, Homer.

260
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,961
You can't spell "obsequious"
without "I-O-U."

261
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,462
I'll have to trust
you on that.

262
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,256
Well, Marge was always
a good speller.

263
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,549
Let's ask her.

264
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:57,842
No! Don't tell Marge.

265
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,635
I'll be good, I'll be good.

266
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,477
Just for that, you have
to crawl around on the floor

267
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,271
like the dog you are.

268
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,982
Yes, ma'am.

269
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,944
Now say "I am Homer Simpson,

270
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,738
the lowly dog"

271
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,197
in a dog's voice.

272
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,074
I am rrr-omer rrr-impson.

273
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,492
Good.
Jump, Homer, jump.

274
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,411
What's going on
in here?

275
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,871
Rabso-rutely rothing, Rarge.

276
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,497
- What's that paper?
- What paper?

277
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,837
Homer.

278
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,422
Is this projection accurate?

279
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,341
Did you borrow money
from my sisters?

280
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,153
I don't know Marge.
I can't be expected to keep track

281
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,095
of all my wheelings
and dealings.

282
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,015
He blew all your savings
on jack-o'-lanterns.

283
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,767
You told!

284
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,187
Sorry, Marge.

285
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,444
I never want to see
you again. You either.

286
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,781
Homer.
Homer, why didn't you tell me?

287
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,616
I was ashamed, Marge.

288
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,576
I failed you as
a husband and a provider,

289
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,537
and at best,
I was a B-plus dog.

290
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,874
I'll understand if you wanna sleep
on the couch tonight.

291
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,964
How's Dad today?

292
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,383
Not too good, Lisa.

293
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,928
Frankly, he's underneath
the table.

294
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,180
Nobody make me any breakfast.

295
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,474
A man so deeply in debt
doesn't deserve it.

296
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,976
But I like to make
you breakfast.

297
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,062
In that case,
I'll just have French toast

298
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,064
with double butter
and a side of bacon.

299
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,858
But no powdered sugar...
I don't deserve it.

300
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,235
Maybe a little powdered sugar.

301
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,992
See that?

302
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,678
I started to do, like,
a little arabesque,

303
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,162
but then I just
fully went for it

304
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,082
and pulled off
the demi-entrechat.

305
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,668
Not that I'm into
that kind of thing.

306
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,628
Bravissimo, Bart!

307
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,506
Next week,
class gives its first recital

308
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,592
and you, you will
dance the male lead.

309
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,302
Dance in front
of my whole school?

310
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,137
What is it with you and ballet?

311
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,265
I know you have
great conflict, Bart.

312
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,724
You love ballet,

313
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:14,728
yet you fear the boys
will laugh at you. No?

314
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,522
No. I fear the girls
will laugh at me.

315
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,941
I fear the boys will beat
the living snot out of me.

316
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,152
Hey Dad,
what you doing?

317
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,613
Daddy has very
important work to do.

318
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,882
He's looking
through the want ads

319
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,491
to find a part-time job.

320
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,910
Dad, that's a gag paper
we got at the carnival.

321
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,079
Oh. No wonder I didn't hear
about Bart being elected.

322
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,373
World's Greatest Sex Machine.

323
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,458
Aw, I'll never pay
off that debt.

324
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,752
Need money fast?
Got no experience?

325
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:42,590
Step up to elegance.
Become a limo driver at Classy Joe's.

326
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,885
That's it! I'll make money
with a chauffeur job.

327
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,220
Good thing you turned
on that TV, Lisa.

328
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,514
I didn't turn it on.
I thought you turned it on.

329
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,100
No. Well, anyway,
turn it off.

330
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,310
It is off.

331
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,961
You're gonna have to work hard
to win this crowd over.

332
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,695
Most of them are here
as part of detention.

333
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,655
Really big crowd.

334
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,198
We even bussed in troublemakers

335
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,283
from other schools.

336
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,964
That spiky-haired, masked dancer
is really something.

337
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,132
I wonder who he is.

338
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,593
He's graceful, yet masculine.

339
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,929
So it's okay for me
to enjoy this.

340
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,932
This reminds me
of the movie Fame,

341
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,851
and to a lesser extent,
the TV series

342
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,062
which was also called Fame.

343
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,108
Oh, wow. I can't believe

344
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,612
my very first passenger is
comedy legend Mel Brooks.

345
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,198
I loved that movie
Young Frankenstein.

346
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,033
Scared the hell out of me.

347
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,785
Um, thanks.

348
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,579
Hey, let's do that
2,000-pound-man thing.

349
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,849
I'll be the Carl Reiner guy,
and you be what's-his-face.

350
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,708
Homer, it's not that easy.

351
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,293
It takes the genius
of Carl Reiner

352
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,188
and the rhythm and timing
that only he and I...

353
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,173
Sir, today every country
has a national anthem.

354
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:09,343
Did they have national anthems
2,000 years ago?

355
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,513
Sure. Sure we had.
Of course we was caves.

356
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,974
But every cave
had a national anthem.

357
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,851
I'll never forget
my cave's national anthem.

358
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,520
What was that national anthem?

359
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,522
Let 'em all go to hell.

360
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,607
Except Cave 76.

361
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,112
Vat's with the si...
What's with the siren?

362
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:32,199
Evening, Simpson.
You got a short in your taillight.

363
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,718
Started blinking when
you made that turn.

364
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,285
Let's see your
Chauffeur's License.

365
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,830
Chauffeur's License, eh?

366
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,748
Mel, buckle
your borscht belt!

367
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,920
Since you're trying
to make a getaway in park

368
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,423
I'm guessing you
don't have a license.

369
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,341
Better head down
to the D.M.V.

370
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,552
These two broads
will help you out.

371
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,432
Wow. Officer, this man
is making me a little edgy.

372
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,118
Could you please give me
a ride to the airport?

373
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,978
Hey! Hey! You're Mel Brooks!

374
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,521
Sure. I'll give you a ride.

375
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,981
Thank you.

376
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,483
On the way, we can do
that 2,000-dollar-man thing.

377
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:11,030
You be Carl Reiner,
and I'll be Police Chief Wiggum.

378
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:14,324
Listen, why don't you play Carl Reiner
and let me play Police Chief Wiggum?

379
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,951
I hate Carl Reiner.

380
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,666
I haven't been moved like this
since the Joy Luck Club.

381
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,006
They love me. I'm accepted.

382
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,591
I don't need this mask anymore.

383
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:34,219
Behold, the masked dancer
is me, Bart.

384
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,390
It is I who have won
your acclaim.

385
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,476
Bart does ballet!

386
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,019
He dances
like girls!

387
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,772
Go ahead and laugh,

388
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,708
but I took a chance and did
something I wanted to do.

389
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,986
And if that makes me a sissy,
well, then, I guess I'm a sissy.

390
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,822
He's a sissy.

391
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,324
Let's rush him.

392
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,326
Yeah, let's get him!

393
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,660
Come on!

394
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,287
After him, go!

395
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,041
There he is!
There, right there!

396
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,710
Bart, use the ballet.

397
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:10,506
Leap, leap like
you've never leapt before.

398
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,850
Looks like he took
a pretty bad spill.

399
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,311
Well, as long as he's hurt.

400
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,816
Bart, I am so proud of you.

401
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,499
You've shown
a sensitive side of yourself

402
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,985
that can never be erased.

403
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,738
From this day forward,
we are kindred spirits.

404
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,492
Why did she
just leave me here

405
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,953
when I clearly need
medical attention?

406
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,667
Stupid driving test
at the stupid D.M.V.

407
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,961
where stupid Patty
and stupid Selma work.

408
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,088
Sometimes,
I think God is teasing me,

409
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,549
just like he teased Moses
in the desert.

410
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,551
Tested, Homer.
God tested Moses.

411
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,886
And try to be nice
to my sisters.

412
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,180
Very hard on me to have you
fighting all the time.

413
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,683
Oh, okay, Marge.
I'll get along with them.

414
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,685
Then, I will hug some snakes.

415
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:09,189
Yes, I will hug and kiss
some poisonous snakes!

416
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,732
Now, that's sarcasm.

417
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,820
Well, well, well.
Look who needs us again

418
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,947
to get his Chauffeur's License.

419
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,241
Look, all I ask
is that you be fair.

420
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,910
Oh! Did not adjust side mirror...
Minus one point.

421
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,329
Failed to check blind
spot... minus two points.

422
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,641
You won't be happy till my family
thinks I'm a loser, will ya?

423
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,041
You are a loser, Homer.

424
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,294
And we're winners.
Ya gotta learn that.

425
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,629
Oh, seat belt twisted...
Minus one point.

426
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,215
Nagging the driver...
Minus ten points for you!

427
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,925
Grazed a cone...
Minus five points.

428
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,529
Being a jerk...
Minus a million points.

429
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,930
- D-oh!
- One more wrong answer,

430
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,267
and Homer flunks another
of life's little tests.

431
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,894
And what's this? Ohhh...

432
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,605
Someone didn't fill in
a circle all the way.

433
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,527
Oh, boy.
Oh, that felt good.

434
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,778
Let me try.
Let me try.

435
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,615
Oh, yeah.
Oh, boy.

436
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,575
Oh, that was so sweet.

437
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,413
- So Homer, how did you do?
- Well, I...

438
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,709
Ladies, please don't
tell me you're smoking

439
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,294
in a government building

440
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,588
because that is precisely
the kind of infraction

441
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,049
that can cost a couple
of sisters their promotion.

442
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,217
- Uh...
- Uh...

443
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,660
- Yeah, oh, what?
- You mean, uh...

444
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,523
I'll never forgive myself
for this.

445
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,402
Wait a minute.

446
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,779
Those are yours, sir?

447
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:39,863
Yes.

448
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,282
I am in flavor country.

449
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,034
Both of them?

450
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,328
It's a big country.

451
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,996
Ladies, I apologize.

452
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,499
And you, sir, are worse than Hitler.

453
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,543
Homer, I'm...

454
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,630
I'm speechless.
You just saved our hides.

455
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,424
Please, on top of everything else,
don't make me picture your hides.

456
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,302
That's a wonderful thing
you did for my sisters.

457
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,387
I didn't do it
for them.

458
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,180
I did it
for you, Marge.

459
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,932
I'd kill for you.

460
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,642
Please ask me
to kill for you.

461
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,436
No, Homey.
You see?

462
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,872
This is the stuff
I've been telling you about

463
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,898
that you never see.

464
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:18,068
Homer...

465
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,113
We're... sorry.

466
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,799
If there's anything
we can do to make it up...

467
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,950
- Call off the debt?
- Or, say we could let you

468
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,285
pass your driver's test.

469
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,829
- Call off the debt?
- Uh... well...

470
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,497
Debt's off. Let's go, Marge.
Whoo-hoo!
