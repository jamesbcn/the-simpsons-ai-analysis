1
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,905
None of you
will inherit anything.

2
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:14,107
Because there isn't any.

3
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:27,621
Previously on The Simpsons,

4
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,857
a charismatic new preacher
came to Springfield.

5
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,092
You want to hold my gun?

6
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,094
You... You can.

7
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,028
And Lisa admired him

8
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,431
like no adult man
she'd ever met.

9
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,933
This brunch has turned into...

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,935
a jazz brunch!

11
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,103
Reverend Lovejoy

12
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,139
lost his job and swore revenge.

13
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,541
This is...

14
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:13,934
This preacher is so amazing.

15
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,268
I'm looking forward to this.

16
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,038
This is the first time
I've come to church

17
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,040
when it's not part
of a big montage

18
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:22,009
of my enemies being whacked.

19
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:23,411
Hey!

20
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:27,014
Well, someone looks awfully nice
for church.

21
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,682
Oh, this thing?

22
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,384
Are you sure
you aren't just attracted

23
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,686
to our handsome new pastor?

24
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:35,922
Silly. Moms aren't attracted
to pastors.

25
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,527
Oh, this place is so crowded.

26
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,897
My leg is touching
Milhouse's dad's.

27
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,199
Looks like we're knee neighbors,
huh, buddy?

28
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,269
Mr. Smithers.

29
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,039
I don't think I've ever seen you
without Mr. Burns.

30
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,907
Oh, Mr. Burns
is more comfortable at home

31
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:55,942
reading his copies
of the scriptures.

32
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,815
Blessed be the poor?

33
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,550
I'm just finding this out now?

34
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,118
No one must know.

35
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,925
Exodus.

36
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,026
Good morning.

37
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,861
Good morning.

38
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,897
For those of you interested
in the Packers game...

39
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,598
We don't want to know.

40
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,401
So, I know some of you still
have some questions about me.

41
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:22,736
I certainly do.

42
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,539
Will you be godfather to my son?

43
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,207
We're not there yet, Mel.

44
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:30,110
But, seriously, fewer and fewer
people are coming to church.

45
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,946
Numbers are declining.
And I get it.

46
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,048
When you tell people
that you believe in God,

47
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,383
usually they take that to mean

48
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,385
that you're quietly judging
their lifestyle

49
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:41,421
or think everybody but you
is going to Hell.

50
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,223
Way to preach, bitch.

51
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,558
I'm gonna pretend
I heard amen.

52
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:45,959
Oh, relax, bitch.

53
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,931
The original function
of religion

54
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,966
was to bring us together.
Religion.

55
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,968
Ligio, like ligament.

56
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,803
It means to reconnect.

57
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,106
They don't teach you that
at medical school.

58
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,140
Yes, they do.

59
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,709
Well, I learn from my mistakes.

60
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:06,046
Malpractice makes malperfect.

61
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,714
Well, I want
to bring us all together.

62
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,083
Not just Christians
but Hindus and Buddhists.

63
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,885
Even those that don't believe.

64
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,887
Does anyone besides me

65
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,822
miss church the way it was?

66
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,794
Well, the crickets agree.

67
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,899
This church has gone from
a place of warm, awkward silence

68
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:29,936
into a gooey lovefest run
by a narcissistic kum-bah-yo-yo,

69
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,038
and I will not stand for it.

70
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,874
You and I believe
in the same God.

71
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,209
I just believe
that that God loves everyone.

72
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,111
You don't agree with that, Ned?

73
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,880
Sir, we are not
on a first-name basis.

74
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,281
Mr. Flanders.

75
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,884
You may call me
New Evangelical Deacon,

76
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,352
or Ned for short.

77
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,954
Okay, Ned, look,
God is the love,

78
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,123
the yes
that set the universe in motion.

79
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,958
He or she...

80
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,230
Maybe this time.

81
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,699
<i>Maybe this time</i>

82
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,968
<i>I'll believe it</i>

83
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:06,139
<i>Maybe this time I'll pray</i>

84
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,880
<i>Maybe this time</i>

85
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,882
<i>For the first time</i>

86
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,717
<i>I'll have fun</i>

87
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:21,054
<i>On Sunday</i>

88
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:29,996
<i>He will sermonize</i>

89
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:34,067
<i>With those hazel eyes</i>

90
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,337
<i>I've got Buddha</i>

91
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,339
<i>I've got science</i>

92
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:43,810
<i>And now Jesus makes three</i>

93
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,913
<i>It's gonna happen</i>

94
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,915
<i>Happen sometime</i>

95
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:52,786
<i>Maybe this time</i>

96
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:56,857
<i>I'll pray</i>

97
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,329
Not bad, kid. Also not good.

98
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,831
Let me show you how it's done.
And a one, and a two.

99
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:05,832
Hey!

100
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,737
Aw, sleeping in church.

101
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:13,240
Like father like daughter.

102
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:16,243
God is nothing but grace
and flow and forgiveness.

103
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,744
And if you don't think so,

104
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,179
I don't know,
maybe you should go back

105
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,014
and read the Bible
a little bit closer.

106
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,383
Are you questioning a man
who travels with extra Bibles

107
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,452
to put them in hotel rooms?

108
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,689
Do you mind?

109
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:30,857
I'm sure you're very sincere,

110
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,893
but a parrot
can recite the Bible

111
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,227
and have no idea what it means.

112
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,896
What? What? What?

113
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,230
This isn't church anymore.

114
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:38,565
We're out of here.

115
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:45,572
Daddy, we can't leave
before the pastor says so.

116
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,674
- Who told you that?
- You did.

117
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,076
You call it Homer Simpson-ing.

118
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,980
Yeah, don't Homer Simpson,
you jerk.

119
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,024
This is where he got fired.

120
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,692
Now we're gonna poke

121
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,862
into Mr. Perfect Pastor's
pysterious past.

122
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,031
Did you just say pysterious?

123
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,767
Can't you be on my side
for once?

124
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,478
Excuse me,
we're looking for the pastor.

125
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,014
Oh, we don't have pastors.
But our touch screen directory

126
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,083
does have a digital assistant.

127
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,485
Hi, I'm Holy Cow.

128
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,254
How can I help you?

129
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:37,857
Please give us your fingerprint
by pressing this screen.

130
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,595
You haven't pressed anything.

131
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,664
Why not?

132
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:50,203
I'd like to speak to someone
below God and above you.

133
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,541
Well, maybe you can find
what you need in here.

134
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:58,678
How many of you suffer from
the effects of mesothelioma?

135
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,947
Dial Jesus at ocho, ocho, ocho,

136
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:04,117
ocho, ocho, ocho, ocho.

137
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,496
Please help us.

138
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,798
This man is a fellow clergyman.

139
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,800
Really?

140
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,635
Church, steeple,

141
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,004
doors, people!

142
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,172
Come with me.

143
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,874
Preacher Mac?

144
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,043
I have a couple here to see you.

145
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,880
I'm here to discuss a matter
of some unpleasantness.

146
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,850
You're not here from
The Boston Globe, are you?

147
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,918
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm a pastor too.

148
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,921
I hear there's a little dirt
on the collar of a man

149
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:45,525
who used to preach here,
Bode Wright.

150
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,193
Him?!

151
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,762
You better sit down.

152
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:52,899
It's a short story,
but I'm gonna milk it.

153
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:58,038
I would go on, but I am down
to my last vocal cord.

154
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,140
Even for a pastor,

155
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:04,144
I've taken way too long
to make a simple point.

156
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,845
Now...

157
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,114
here's the proof.

158
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,720
Oh, my God, so many
singles in my area

159
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,822
want to meet me.

160
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,193
Possessions don't matter,

161
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,863
money doesn't matter,
this doesn't matter.

162
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,032
Is he burning
what I think he's burning?

163
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,200
I've got him now.

164
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:37,410
Lisa Marie Simpson,
are you reading the Bible?

165
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:39,712
Yes, it's good, but...

166
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,081
I have a few notes.

167
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,916
Yeah, well I never met a Hittite

168
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,919
who wasn't trying to expand
his empire into Egypt.

169
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,822
Oh, Hittites...
worse than the Canaanites!

170
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:52,826
Oh, now who's doing this because
of the handsome new pastor?

171
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,060
Reverend Wright?

172
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,829
You think he's...

173
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,831
Oh, why pretend?

174
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:01,501
When he speaks, I feel like
he's speaking only to me.

175
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,870
Oh, Lisa, honey, I'm worried
you'll get too attached.

176
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,006
This town has a way of rejecting
what's new and different.

177
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,942
And better.

178
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,043
Not this time.

179
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,612
But look at your vision board.

180
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,682
It's full of nothing
but crushing disappointment.

181
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,221
Even your vision board
is a failure.

182
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,956
That hook was supposed to hold

183
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,125
a lifetime's worth
of disappointment.

184
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,033
Get thee behind me, Saturn.

185
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,038
I need to pee.

186
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,541
No time.
We've got defrocking to do.

187
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,943
Timothy,
I've never seen you like this.

188
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,279
Maybe I'll do
some defrocking too.

189
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,281
In the choo choo room?

190
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,750
Okay, mood's gone.

191
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,252
Two beers, Moe.

192
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,553
Nothing for the reverend.

193
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,921
Oh, howdy there, Rev.

194
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,123
Well, can't let him see
my nudie glasses.

195
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,694
You didn't have to break
your nudie glasses.

196
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,196
Now you tell me.
Remind me...

197
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,898
How many boobs
does a woman have?

198
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:08,001
I never got so much
off my chest.

199
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:12,005
So, then I coveted
my neighbor's riding mower.

200
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:15,508
I never pedal when I'm
on a bicycle built for two.

201
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,677
- Homer...
- I went trick-or-treating

202
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,179
when I was 30.

203
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:23,383
Also, I told Marge
I was going for a colonoscopy

204
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:27,086
when I actually went to
a Planet of the Apes marathon.

205
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,389
Including the Tim Burton one.

206
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,623
God doesn't care.

207
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,758
Hallelujah!

208
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,426
Please.
I make my living in here.

209
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,929
Sorry. So am I forgiven?

210
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,564
You're a good man,
Homer Simpson.

211
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,933
Behind all your behavior,
good and bad,

212
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,935
there's a still, quiet place

213
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,736
untouched by the dramas
of this life

214
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,972
where you simply are goodness.

215
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,808
Oh, you haven't heard
the worst one.

216
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,810
I had impure thoughts

217
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:54,113
about the mother bear
in the toilet paper ads.

218
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,284
Reverend? If that is
your real honorific.

219
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:01,187
You are late
for our parishioners' visit.

220
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,423
I've been preparing all day.

221
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,058
Sorry.
I've got to go.

222
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:08,294
Homer, does this Flanders guy
ever annoy you?

223
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,072
From time to time.

224
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,610
Move it, move it, move it.

225
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,746
All right.

226
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,082
Which arm did the honking?

227
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,150
I'm not telling.

228
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,256
Come in.

229
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,472
You, sir,
have challenged me on scripture.

230
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,911
Oh. Well, if it's scripture
you want to talk,

231
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,914
then let us make a joyful noise
unto the Lord.

232
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,083
- Good.
- Good.

233
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,325
Punishment is the key to belief.

234
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,760
Matthew 25:46.

235
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,862
They will go away to
eternal punishment, but the...

236
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,096
Righteous to eternal life.
Sure.

237
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,665
But God's grace is for everyone.

238
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,033
John 12:32.

239
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,934
I will draw all people...

240
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,603
Up to myself.

241
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,506
What about 2 Thessalonians 1:9?

242
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,742
They will suffer the punishment
of eternal destruction...

243
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,743
Romans 11:32.

244
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,246
He may have mercy on them all.

245
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,914
Them all.

246
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,853
Genesis 3:23.

247
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,523
So the Lord banished him
from the Garden.

248
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,591
Genesis 1:31.

249
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,393
God saw all that he had made,

250
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,696
and it was very good.

251
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:50,763
Bang.

252
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,534
I'm cold, so cold.

253
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,436
And I'm wearing three sweaters.

254
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:02,809
This is what it would be like

255
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,978
if they believed in God
in Hawaii.

256
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,414
Reverend,
you come to dinner at my house!

257
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,917
Yeah,
I'm gonna take a rain check.

258
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,018
So many checks,

259
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,053
so little rain.

260
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,522
Stop this revelry!

261
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,990
Who are you?!

262
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,928
Reverend Lovejoy!

263
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:25,231
And I'm just back from Michigan.

264
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,066
Can you point accusingly for me?

265
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,035
You got it.

266
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:31,371
This man is a heretic.

267
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:35,208
Oh, no. No, Lisa, don't.

268
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,409
Wait, wait, wait!

269
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,879
Surely, we know the reverend
is a blessed man who...

270
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,881
Lisa, I did something bad.

271
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,717
How bad could it be?
Seriously.

272
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,120
Well, look at you,

273
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:50,022
finally paying attention to me.

274
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,191
One brief announcement,
there's a red Honda Civic

275
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,926
in the parking lot
with its lights on.

276
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,261
You're losing them.

277
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:58,097
He burned the Bible.

278
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:03,803
Oh, boy.

279
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,971
That's appalling.
I mean, come on.

280
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,473
Psalms are not for burning.
They're for tattoos.

281
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,475
So, you know, you sicken me.

282
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:12,044
Everything in my heart tells me
this isn't true!

283
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,380
I know this is a weird thing
to say in church,

284
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,048
but we need proof.

285
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:19,419
I demand a full hearing
in front of all of us!

286
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,087
Oh, you'll get your hearing.

287
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,723
Tuesday at 4:00.

288
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,659
Another paradise lost.

289
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:29,996
Lisa, you're really bringing
down the first Sunday of Lent.

290
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:33,065
Even the fire eater is sad.

291
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:41,374
The crisis of faith grows
as support for im-preach-ment

292
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,708
is now at 52%.

293
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,944
Can you fight fire with firing?

294
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,847
What should we do
with this Judas priest?

295
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,449
This has been Kent Brockman
talking,

296
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,117
saying nothing.

297
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,092
Welcome, all of you.
Let's begin.

298
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,161
Why is she running this?

299
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,297
Because she won't
get overexcited.

300
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,799
And I will?!

301
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:10,069
And the Bible said,
a child shall lead them.

302
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,972
Well, as my Lord Buddha said,

303
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,141
three things
cannot long be hidden.

304
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,811
The sun, the moon,
and the truth.

305
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,847
Well, why don't they make that
a Google Doodle?

306
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,850
Reverend, you're very concerned
with the Bible.

307
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,052
So, let us turn to that Bible.

308
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:29,055
Specifically,
the very, very, many parts

309
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,524
that speak about forgiveness.

310
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:41,000
And, Mom, thank you
for sewing these banners.

311
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:44,003
I did all that work
for a ten-second bit?

312
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,705
He did it.
He admitted it.

313
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,507
What else do you need?

314
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,509
We've mobbed for less, people.

315
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,078
Yeah, remember the guy with
the two different-colored socks?

316
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,946
Ran his ass right out of town.

317
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,381
Banish him!

318
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:58,885
Banish him! Banish him!

319
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,821
Cherish him! Cherish him!

320
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,223
I know
another long-haired performer

321
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,992
who preached a new philosophy,

322
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,493
peace and love.

323
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,995
And the crowd was with him,

324
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,830
but then they turned, hard.

325
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,865
And that man's name

326
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,734
was Willie Nelson!

327
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,004
Well, I say, banish him!
Banish him!

328
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,873
Banish him! Banish him!

329
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,508
Stop!

330
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:25,678
I came here to unify you,
but instead I divided you.

331
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,179
So I'm leaving.

332
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,849
I just hope what I said
resonated with a few of you.

333
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,717
Like Lisa,
one who may change the world.

334
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,422
And that Sea Captain guy.
That dude is surprisingly woke.

335
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:40,059
Yarr, activism means nothing
if it's not intersectional.

336
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:41,327
Yarr!

337
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,063
Glad to have known you.

338
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,767
I just want to say,
you've changed my life forever.

339
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,069
You're the first minister
I've ever met

340
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:52,071
I didn't want
to slap across the face.

341
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:53,906
Glad to have known you.

342
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:56,742
And I just want to say,
rot in Hell, Bible burner.

343
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,578
Glad to have known you.

344
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,012
- Glad to have...
- Bup-bup-bup.

345
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,615
In my family, you don't say
goodbye to someone

346
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:05,017
you care about
without a meat loaf.

347
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,019
And broccoli.

348
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,021
You're inviting me over
for dinner?

349
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,890
If you can love us
after seeing us eat,

350
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,792
we'll know you really love us.

351
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,827
Come on, pal.
We're having roast Bible.

352
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,497
What? Too soon?

353
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,834
I just want to offer
this simple prayer.

354
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:24,470
Dear God, please let
the Simpsons never end.

355
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,472
Amen.

356
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,574
And, Bode,
tomorrow I have to ask you

357
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:31,911
a philosophical question,
so I'll see you at the church.

358
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:34,413
Amen.

359
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,982
Where the hell have you been?

360
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,251
Why would you burn a Bible?

361
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,520
Why couldn't you burn
Bill O'Reilly's books?

362
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,589
There are so many.

363
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,925
I was trying to tell people
that God is in your heart,

364
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,928
not in a overbuilt cathedral
or some book.

365
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:50,863
This town doesn't get subtext.

366
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,266
Our NPR station
broadcasts wrestling.

367
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,836
And that's an excruciating
half nelson.

368
00:18:56,902 --> 00:19:00,272
Now, is that what's known in
the lexicon as a face stomp?

369
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,775
Yes, yes, it is.

370
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:05,678
This is NPR pledge week.
Please give.

371
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,114
- Why did you do it?
- I was 19.

372
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,118
I saw how people were using
the Bible to divide and exclude.

373
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,620
People were so busy
worshipping a road map

374
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,456
instead of trying
to reach the destination.

375
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,025
You know what I mean?

376
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,794
Well, why didn't you
just say that?

377
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,196
That was fine. No fire.

378
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:27,633
- I was 19.
- I'm eight and I get it.

379
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,968
You're right.

380
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:31,303
I've regretted it
since the day I did it.

381
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,372
So, since then,
I've just wandered the world,

382
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:36,042
like a millennial on a gap year.

383
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,911
I understand, but how
are you gonna convince...?

384
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,183
I'll just have faith
in this town's open heart.

385
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:48,888
I was just making sure
it doesn't say we forgive you.

386
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,390
- It doesn't.
- Unless they wrote it in red.

387
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:52,425
Yeah, no.

388
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:53,859
- No, they didn't.
- No.

389
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,028
- The brick is the message.
- Them's my people.

390
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,196
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

391
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:58,497
Do we throw it back?
What's your custom?

392
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:06,939
Chief, this guy still had
ten minutes on his meter.

393
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:09,775
Just when I understood that guy,
when I believed again,

394
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:12,578
when I believed in people,
they took him away.

395
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,880
I've lost my faith, Lou.

396
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,049
Come on, Chief,
you got a beautiful wife

397
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:19,018
and kid... I can't...

398
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:22,254
I'm sorry, I can't say that
with a straight face.

399
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,123
Well, you could try.

400
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,860
I am. I'm trying, I'm sorry.

401
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,261
I'm sorry.
I'll maybe try again.

402
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,863
You got a beau...

403
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,799
tiful wife and kid.
