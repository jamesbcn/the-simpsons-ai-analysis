1
00:01:04,008 --> 00:01:05,476
D'oh!

2
00:01:08,513 --> 00:01:09,413
Hmm?

3
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:24,294
Number two.

4
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:44,608
Aw...

5
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:47,144
Oh, I thought we were
going to breakfast.

6
00:02:47,212 --> 00:02:49,046
First we're
visiting Grampa.

7
00:02:49,113 --> 00:02:51,215
No fair!
We just went to church!

8
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:52,983
Yeah, so we've already heard
stories

9
00:02:53,051 --> 00:02:55,753
from thousands of years ago
about stuff that didn't happen.

10
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,620
Oh!

11
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:58,190
I have an important

12
00:02:58,258 --> 00:02:58,558
announcement to make.

13
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:00,476
I've had a lot of time to think

14
00:03:00,544 --> 00:03:03,946
since my hands got too shaky
to play cards. D'oh!

15
00:03:04,714 --> 00:03:06,949
It's not your
fault, Grampa.

16
00:03:07,016 --> 00:03:09,651
These cards are
too slippery. See?

17
00:03:14,223 --> 00:03:16,158
Damn it!

18
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:20,295
Anywhen, I've decided to give
you all your inheritance now.

19
00:03:21,397 --> 00:03:23,565
Are you sure about that, Grampa?

20
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:26,902
I just want to see
the look on your faces

21
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,806
when I share with you the fruits
of a lifetime of labor.

22
00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:35,944
50 bucks each?!

23
00:03:36,012 --> 00:03:38,313
That's your life savings?!

24
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:40,349
This won't even cover the vig
on what I owe!

25
00:03:42,452 --> 00:03:45,954
Well, I lost the rest
investing in a Broadway musical

26
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:48,824
based on the real-life story
of Eddie Gaedel,

27
00:03:48,891 --> 00:03:51,727
the midget who had one
big league at-bat.

28
00:03:51,794 --> 00:03:57,099
I even wrote a song for American
League president Will Harridge!

29
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:01,603
♪ What do I do with this
damn little man? ♪

30
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:05,140
♪ His strike zone's the size
of a tuna fish can! ♪

31
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:13,982
♪ His strike zone's the size
of a tuna fish can ♪

32
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,184
Now remember what Grampa said:

33
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:18,854
you can spend the money
any way you want.

34
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:20,989
I just paid some
loser 50 bucks

35
00:04:21,057 --> 00:04:24,259
to walk up the down escalator
all day.

36
00:04:26,295 --> 00:04:29,097
I bet it's 11:00.
I bet it's 11:00!

37
00:04:29,165 --> 00:04:32,367
Oh, 9:15?!

38
00:04:32,435 --> 00:04:35,704
Hmm, I think I'll look
for a new handbag.

39
00:04:37,907 --> 00:04:40,108
Ooh, so many celebrities have
their own label:

40
00:04:40,176 --> 00:04:42,644
Princess Penelope, Booberella,

41
00:04:42,712 --> 00:04:46,815
The Real Housewives of
Ogdenville, even Scratchy.

42
00:04:46,883 --> 00:04:51,219
Oh... I wonder how much
that one is.

43
00:04:51,287 --> 00:04:52,754
Gotta look without looking
like I'm looking.

44
00:04:54,057 --> 00:04:56,258
Yes!

45
00:04:56,408 --> 00:04:58,743
I'd like this bag, please.

46
00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:00,445
Marge Simpson!

47
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:03,114
Are you buying a Marc Fredericks
signature handbag?

48
00:05:03,182 --> 00:05:05,149
Why wouldn't I?

49
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:08,052
Well... those bags <i>are</i>
pretty pricey.

50
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,254
Hey, my husband makes
good money,

51
00:05:10,322 --> 00:05:11,856
and we can
certainly afford...

52
00:05:11,924 --> 00:05:14,325
That'll be $500.

53
00:05:15,861 --> 00:05:17,462
Oh, I didn't realize...

54
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:19,096
What's the matter, Marge?

55
00:05:19,164 --> 00:05:21,466
Just remembered
your husband's not a doctor?

56
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:23,367
Oh, my God,
you are so burned!

57
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:26,704
I'll take it!

58
00:05:26,772 --> 00:05:27,872
Ooh!

59
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,373
Well done, Marge.

60
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:33,845
If you're looking for a bag hag,
I'm your man. Okay?

61
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:36,414
But stay on my good side,
girlfriend.

62
00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:37,949
Or... uh-oh!

63
00:05:40,052 --> 00:05:41,953
<i>$500?!</i>

64
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,222
That's, like,
ten dead Grampas!

65
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:46,123
Some of us stuck
to our limit, Marge.

66
00:05:46,191 --> 00:05:49,827
And I would've loved to rent
this carpet cleaner another day!

67
00:05:49,895 --> 00:05:52,129
Is that the cat
in there?!

68
00:05:52,197 --> 00:05:54,532
Well, it's <i>a</i> cat.
I'm not sure it's <i>the</i> cat.

69
00:05:56,502 --> 00:05:58,369
Don't worry, Homer,

70
00:05:58,437 --> 00:05:59,704
I'll return the handbag

71
00:05:59,771 --> 00:06:01,639
first thing tomorrow.

72
00:06:03,408 --> 00:06:05,243
You know what, honey?

73
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,578
Just because we can't afford
to keep that handbag

74
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:10,381
doesn't mean that
you two can't have one night

75
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:12,216
at the most glamorous
place in town.

76
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:18,189
Right this way.

77
00:06:29,635 --> 00:06:32,637
Well, at least it's a good place
to see celebrities.

78
00:06:34,172 --> 00:06:35,706
It's not what
you think!

79
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:39,410
I'm researching a movie
where I play myself.

80
00:06:40,846 --> 00:06:43,614
Wait a minute.
Is that bag Marc Fredericks?

81
00:06:43,682 --> 00:06:44,882
Mm-hmm.

82
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,119
You know, a much nicer table
just opened up!

83
00:06:51,423 --> 00:06:52,590
Hmm!

84
00:06:52,658 --> 00:06:54,592
After Bart,

85
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,695
that bag's the best
mistake we ever made.

86
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:02,133
I'm gonna go, uh,
study the menu.

87
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,167
Heh.

88
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:06,637
So, I want to honor Grampa

89
00:07:06,705 --> 00:07:08,673
by giving my inheritance
to charity.

90
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,608
But which one?

91
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:14,078
Ooh, what's this?

92
00:07:17,215 --> 00:07:20,952
<i>Most banks are for the haves,</i>
<i>not the have-nots.</i>

93
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:25,189
I'm sorry, but we simply
can't accept your collateral.

94
00:07:25,257 --> 00:07:28,926
I am just a goat,
but even I know that a peasant

95
00:07:28,994 --> 00:07:31,362
in an emerging economy
can't get a break.

96
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,265
She needs a microloan.

97
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,334
<i>A guilty first-worlder lends</i>

98
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:37,835
<i>$50 or more</i>
<i>to the Microloan Bank,</i>

99
00:07:37,903 --> 00:07:39,804
<i>who uses it to help my owner</i>

100
00:07:39,871 --> 00:07:40,972
<i>finance her business.</i>

101
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,273
Working together,

102
00:07:42,341 --> 00:07:43,808
we can help people
help themselves!

103
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,143
And now, apparently,
I am a girl.

104
00:07:50,282 --> 00:07:51,616
Mmm...

105
00:07:51,683 --> 00:07:53,050
Hmm.

106
00:07:53,118 --> 00:07:55,586
Come on, Marge,
let's hit the buffet.

107
00:07:55,654 --> 00:07:57,321
You go ahead; I'll stay here.

108
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:59,090
If I get something
on this handbag,

109
00:07:59,157 --> 00:08:01,092
I won't be able to return it.

110
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:03,227
Oh, you don't want to
wait for that buffet.

111
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:04,462
Wiggum's making
his move!

112
00:08:07,165 --> 00:08:08,699
I need backup, Lou.

113
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:11,369
Get two plates and follow me.

114
00:08:11,436 --> 00:08:14,805
Uh, Chief, not now;
I'm undercover.

115
00:08:14,873 --> 00:08:16,107
Oh, it's like
that, huh?

116
00:08:16,174 --> 00:08:17,408
The minute you
go undercover,

117
00:08:17,476 --> 00:08:19,443
you act like you
don't even know me!

118
00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:22,313
He'll turn on you, too,
Fat Tony, you just wait!

119
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,688
Mm, I suppose I should
get something to eat.

120
00:08:35,727 --> 00:08:37,528
Hey!

121
00:08:37,596 --> 00:08:38,796
Waah...!

122
00:08:42,467 --> 00:08:44,001
Oh, thank God!

123
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:47,371
I can take that for you.

124
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:53,277
Homer, take me home!

125
00:08:53,345 --> 00:08:54,912
Sure, sure!

126
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,715
Let me just
grab one more shrimp.

127
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:08,092
Boy, I bet that looked cool
in super slow motion.

128
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,361
Too bad we saw it
in regular motion.

129
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:12,196
Yeah, I got bigger
problems, Chief.

130
00:09:12,264 --> 00:09:15,032
I'm in love with
the don's daughter!

131
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,134
But which me
does <i>she</i> love?

132
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:18,069
I don't know.

133
00:09:20,172 --> 00:09:23,441
Hmm...

134
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:25,509
Thank you so much
for clicking on me.

135
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:27,745
I am Muhammad Yunus,
founder of the Grameen Bank,

136
00:09:27,813 --> 00:09:30,948
and, oh yeah, I'm also the
winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.

137
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:35,686
To find an entrepreneur you want
to lend to, click on my nose...

138
00:09:35,754 --> 00:09:37,021
if you can catch it.

139
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:38,255
It's up here!

140
00:09:38,323 --> 00:09:39,390
Now down here!

141
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,558
Too slow!

142
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,625
Okay, I'll hold still.

143
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:42,693
No, I won't.

144
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:43,928
Ha-ha!
Got it!

145
00:09:43,995 --> 00:09:45,763
<i>Good-bye!</i>

146
00:09:45,831 --> 00:09:47,598
Let's see, I could help someone

147
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,600
in any impoverished
area on Earth.

148
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:50,868
Bangladesh.

149
00:09:50,936 --> 00:09:52,236
Bolivia.

150
00:09:52,304 --> 00:09:55,005
East Springfield?

151
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:01,412
My name is Nelson Mandela Muntz.

152
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,313
Nelson?

153
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,647
And my dream is

154
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:05,716
to make and market
custom bicycles.

155
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:08,519
Nelson! My dream is
to make enough money

156
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:12,490
so's I can get the rest
of this tattoo removed.

157
00:10:12,557 --> 00:10:14,725
Sorry I wasted your time.

158
00:10:14,793 --> 00:10:17,962
No fool would take a chance
on a loser like me.

159
00:10:19,898 --> 00:10:23,300
I will. I'll take a chance
on you, Nelson Muntz.

160
00:10:24,903 --> 00:10:27,805
Nelson, I gotta take this
computer to the pawn shop,

161
00:10:27,873 --> 00:10:30,241
so's we can get White Castle
for your birthday.

162
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:40,246
So, Nelson, I see
you started a small business.

163
00:10:40,314 --> 00:10:41,681
Yeah.

164
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:43,783
Some anonymous dude
sent me 50 bucks.

165
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,786
Probably someone cool like
Famous Amos or Ba Ba Booey.

166
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,222
And I'm gonna justify
his faith in me.

167
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,125
Well, whoever your
mysterious donor is,

168
00:10:52,192 --> 00:10:55,762
he, or she, <i>really</i>
wants you to succeed.

169
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:56,796
Ding-dong!

170
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,698
Ooh, your
first customer!

171
00:10:58,766 --> 00:11:00,567
Be nice.
Right. Nice.

172
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:02,602
Good day, Mr. Barf-Breath.

173
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,203
Good day to you.

174
00:11:04,271 --> 00:11:07,907
Let me be frank:
Everyone thinks you're a wuss.

175
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:10,109
So, we'll change
the pink to black,

176
00:11:10,177 --> 00:11:11,511
elevate the seat--

177
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:12,979
trust me, it's slimming--

178
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,449
and change this wicker
basket to no basket.

179
00:11:16,517 --> 00:11:19,085
Do you like it?
Oh, I love it!

180
00:11:19,153 --> 00:11:21,387
Hmm!
Hmm!

181
00:11:21,455 --> 00:11:23,690
Wow, my first job.

182
00:11:23,757 --> 00:11:26,693
Tonight I'm having
peanut butter <i>and</i> jelly.

183
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,028
No more PB <i>or</i> J for me.

184
00:11:35,002 --> 00:11:37,136
Stay cool, Marge.
Stay cool.

185
00:11:39,106 --> 00:11:41,407
I'd like to return this handbag.

186
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:42,442
Unused.

187
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:44,377
I believe this stranger!

188
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:51,818
Well, here's your refund.

189
00:11:58,425 --> 00:12:00,994
Check and mate.

190
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:02,495
Thank God!

191
00:12:02,563 --> 00:12:04,597
I will never do that again.

192
00:12:04,665 --> 00:12:06,099
Wait a minute, Marge.

193
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,301
Don't you realize
what just happened?

194
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:11,037
You got to enjoy that bag
for nothing!

195
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,805
We can buy stuff
we can't afford,

196
00:12:12,873 --> 00:12:14,674
temporarily own
the hell out of it,

197
00:12:14,742 --> 00:12:17,777
and then indignantly bring
it back for a full refund.

198
00:12:18,846 --> 00:12:20,847
Hide a sandwich in this hat.

199
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:23,416
"Mary Poppins" myself to work
with this umbrella.

200
00:12:23,484 --> 00:12:26,386
Homie, you know what happens
when you push your luck...

201
00:12:26,453 --> 00:12:28,621
Yeah, the luck
lasts longer!

202
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:32,392
Thanks to the power of returns,
this store is our closet!

203
00:12:35,596 --> 00:12:38,264
Ooh, a message
from my small business person!

204
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:41,567
Dear anonymous investor:

205
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:44,270
Here is my update
on my small business.

206
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:46,439
I'm making money fist over face!

207
00:12:46,507 --> 00:12:47,907
Dingus!

208
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,909
Great timing!

209
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,611
Awesome!

210
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,214
No way I can look nerdy
on this bike.

211
00:12:55,282 --> 00:12:58,084
♪ Hot cross buns,
hot cross buns ♪

212
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,886
♪ One a penny, two a penny ♪

213
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:01,554
♪ Hot cross buns ♪

214
00:13:01,622 --> 00:13:03,890
And, with the money I'm making,

215
00:13:03,957 --> 00:13:06,392
<i>I can treat my mom</i>
<i>the way she deserves!</i>

216
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,228
This place is so fancy, Nelson.

217
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:12,231
The ketchup packets
are made of glass.

218
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:16,169
Ma, please.
You're not at work.

219
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,009
Come in. Come in.

220
00:13:23,077 --> 00:13:25,878
Don't wipe
your feet.

221
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:27,780
Whoa, look at
all this stuff!

222
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,016
Did you find a mouse
head in your Cuppa-Soup?

223
00:13:30,084 --> 00:13:31,718
I wish.

224
00:13:31,785 --> 00:13:33,553
What the hell are you doing?!

225
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,755
With this protective plastic
overlay, I can't tell

226
00:13:35,823 --> 00:13:39,125
if I'm watching an old <i>Seinfeld</i>
or an old <i>Old Christine.</i>

227
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,494
Now, everyone
onto the hot tub.

228
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,467
Come on on.

229
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:48,968
The cardboard's fine.

230
00:13:50,838 --> 00:13:52,305
Hi, Nelson.

231
00:13:52,372 --> 00:13:54,273
Here again, huh, Lis?

232
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:56,342
I guess now
that I'm a success,

233
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,478
you want to get
back together with me.

234
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:00,480
Dolph called it.

235
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:03,516
No, but there is something
I can't hold back anymore.

236
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:05,852
I'm your microfinance donor!

237
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:08,254
You're L-Simpson-Jazzgirl?

238
00:14:08,322 --> 00:14:09,689
Oh, my God.

239
00:14:09,757 --> 00:14:10,990
I owe you everything.

240
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,092
Well, I didn't do this
for thanks,

241
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,927
but if you want
to thank me,

242
00:14:14,995 --> 00:14:18,064
I can stand here and listen
for as long as it takes.

243
00:14:18,132 --> 00:14:19,365
I'm sure
you can.

244
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:21,067
Lisa, if it weren't for you,

245
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:23,536
I never would have achieved
the kind of success

246
00:14:23,604 --> 00:14:25,705
that has allowed me
to quit school.

247
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:27,473
You're quitting school?!

248
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,042
Dropping it like a melon
off an overpass.

249
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,912
But don't you know that people
who don't go to college

250
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,014
make three percent less
than people who do?

251
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,582
Lisa, thanks to you,

252
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,484
and Nobel laureate
Mohammad Yunus,

253
00:14:38,552 --> 00:14:41,120
I can do... this!

254
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:45,224
Spelling, meet F-Y-R-E.

255
00:14:50,872 --> 00:14:52,873
Principal Skinner,
I need to convince Nelson

256
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,508
to come back to school.

257
00:14:54,575 --> 00:14:56,276
Seriously? Why?
With Nelson gone,

258
00:14:56,344 --> 00:14:59,012
lunch money's finally making
its way to the cafeteria.

259
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,948
Nurples are returning to
their natural, non-purple hue.

260
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:05,485
Besides, I hear he's doing quite
well with his bicycle pimpery.

261
00:15:05,553 --> 00:15:09,222
He is. He's paying people
$11 an hour to work for him.

262
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,724
$11 an hour?

263
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:12,192
That's night watchman money.

264
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,528
Maybe I should have
a chat with him.

265
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:16,897
Which of these ties
says confidence?

266
00:15:16,964 --> 00:15:18,532
Isn't that a Christmas tie?

267
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:19,866
It's a conversation starter!

268
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:21,668
Lisa, this conversation is over.

269
00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:23,937
It's not you I'm trying
to impress, it's Nelson.

270
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:26,072
I know
he likes the sleeveless look.

271
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,607
Skinner!

272
00:15:27,675 --> 00:15:32,446
Oh. Oh, so you also heard
about the, uh, $11 an hour.

273
00:15:32,513 --> 00:15:34,181
I heard about it first.

274
00:15:34,248 --> 00:15:37,384
Yes, well, you see
the thing about that is... Blah!

275
00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:42,889
Good afternoon.

276
00:15:42,957 --> 00:15:44,925
I'd like to return
this merchandise.

277
00:15:44,992 --> 00:15:48,094
"Wrong size, wrong color,
not asictured,

278
00:15:48,162 --> 00:15:50,864
and other reason
please explain."

279
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:55,435
Sir, this suitcase has
an airline tag on it,

280
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:57,537
these ping-pong balls have
been served and volleyed,

281
00:15:57,605 --> 00:15:58,939
and this hot
plate's still warm.

282
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:03,543
Yes, uh... maybe
I'll just come back

283
00:16:03,611 --> 00:16:05,111
during someone else's shift.

284
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:06,713
Is Claire working today?

285
00:16:06,781 --> 00:16:08,148
She's a real sucker.

286
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:10,817
Let me get my supervisor.

287
00:16:10,885 --> 00:16:13,820
Hello, Homer.
How do you know my name?

288
00:16:13,888 --> 00:16:17,257
I'm Chris Hansen
from <i>To Catch a Credit-Whore.</i>

289
00:16:17,325 --> 00:16:20,026
We know you've been returning
used items all over town.

290
00:16:20,094 --> 00:16:22,262
Oh, it's not what you think...

291
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,699
I came here to warn them-- yes,
to-to warn them about, um...

292
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:28,802
People like you?
Yes! I mean no! I mean...

293
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,537
You'll never get me!

294
00:16:32,406 --> 00:16:35,342
I have to sign a release so
you can broadcast this, right?

295
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:41,248
Initial there,
and... Never!

296
00:16:41,315 --> 00:16:43,683
Can you tell me when
this is gonna be on?

297
00:16:43,751 --> 00:16:45,018
I'm thinking
of having a party.

298
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:53,660
Lisa, why did you
bring me here?

299
00:16:53,728 --> 00:16:55,195
Oh, I don't know.

300
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:56,930
I thought one
of these super-successful people

301
00:16:56,998 --> 00:16:59,533
might tell you how important
it is to stay in school.

302
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,637
Why, look. It's Mark Zuckerberg,
the founder of Facebook!

303
00:17:05,106 --> 00:17:06,473
Mr. Zuckerberg, I'm Lisa,

304
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,841
and this is Nelson.

305
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:09,342
S'up, Zuck?

306
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,810
"Mark Zuckerberg is...

307
00:17:10,878 --> 00:17:13,380
happy to meet new friends."

308
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:15,482
That's great,
Mr. Zuckerberg,

309
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,250
but I was hoping
you could tell us

310
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:20,720
how education was
instrumental to your success.

311
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:23,557
Well, the truth is...
I dropped out of Harvard.

312
00:17:23,624 --> 00:17:25,959
You did?
Better earnin' than learnin'!

313
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:28,295
Hell, yeah! I'll get
the best kind of degree--

314
00:17:28,362 --> 00:17:29,996
honorary, baby!

315
00:17:30,064 --> 00:17:32,599
Well, clearly,
you're an exception.

316
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:35,602
Am I, Lisa?
Bill Gates-- dropout.

317
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,104
Virgin Airlines'
Richard Branson-- dropout.

318
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:41,908
Well... didn't anybody here stay
in school?

319
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:44,644
I did. Graduated
magna cum lade.

320
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,213
There, you see?

321
00:17:47,281 --> 00:17:48,682
I'm afraid

322
00:17:48,749 --> 00:17:50,584
I haven't done
too well for myself.

323
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:53,420
But I can certainly appreciate
the irony of it.

324
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:07,911
So, how did everyone do
with their $50?

325
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:09,796
Well, I learned
a valuable lesson

326
00:18:09,864 --> 00:18:11,765
about wanting more
than I could afford.

327
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,233
Marge, you couldn't have fun

328
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,635
if you were a monkey
on a banana boat!

329
00:18:15,703 --> 00:18:18,405
I used Grampa's money
to try to help someone in need,

330
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,407
but it didn't go the way
I expected.

331
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,577
Aw, sweetie, money
can't change people.

332
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,912
It can just help them
be who they are.

333
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,547
I gave a bum a dollar once,

334
00:18:27,615 --> 00:18:30,884
and he used it to buy
an Ellery Queen mystery.

335
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:33,954
But there was one mystery
Ellery Queen couldn't solve--

336
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:36,623
why a man was named Ellery.

337
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:38,491
But my point is,

338
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,662
whatever I said before I started
talking about Ellery Queen.

339
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:49,202
Nelson, I just wanted to say
that I realize now

340
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,940
you can't be anyone else other
than who you are, and... Huh?

341
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:57,677
Look, everyone,
just chill out!

342
00:18:57,745 --> 00:18:59,613
My <i>Wizard of Oz</i> bike
fell apart

343
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,314
in the middle
of the Pride parade!

344
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:02,883
What kind of pride?

345
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,418
Never you mind what kind!
Fix my bike!

346
00:19:05,486 --> 00:19:07,554
I want my money back!

347
00:19:07,622 --> 00:19:10,891
Fine. Here's exactly
what you paid me.

348
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,425
Thank you!

349
00:19:12,493 --> 00:19:15,528
Oh! Why is this happening?

350
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:19,132
Uh, this epoxy you've been using
is water soluble,

351
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,468
which means it's not
weather-resistant.

352
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,270
Dumb it down for me.

353
00:19:23,337 --> 00:19:27,374
Um... bike... sticky...
water go bye-bye?

354
00:19:27,441 --> 00:19:29,876
Some sticky water stay-stay?

355
00:19:29,944 --> 00:19:31,011
All bye-bye.

356
00:19:31,078 --> 00:19:33,446
Oh!
Hi, Nelson.

357
00:19:33,514 --> 00:19:36,082
Lisa, I've been
thinking and...

358
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,519
It fell apart when I was trying
to impress this cute girl.

359
00:19:39,587 --> 00:19:41,254
My gramma!

360
00:19:41,322 --> 00:19:43,590
Maybe I could use a
little more school.

361
00:19:43,658 --> 00:19:45,058
You can't
break us up.

362
00:19:45,126 --> 00:19:46,493
We're like a
family here.

363
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,461
Kearney and I are
having brunch on Sunday.

364
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:49,996
If I'm up.

365
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,432
Listen, what say
we go back to the school?

366
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,336
I'll help you out with a little
micro-financing of my own.

367
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:59,306
$50! I can buy paint
for the art class,

368
00:19:59,373 --> 00:20:01,808
instead of those crushed-up
berries I find in the woods.

369
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:04,945
And Lisa, I've got a little left
that I'd like to spend on you.

370
00:20:07,949 --> 00:20:10,317
This is really fun.

371
00:20:10,384 --> 00:20:12,218
But we're still just
friends, right?

372
00:20:12,286 --> 00:20:13,787
Right. Friends.

373
00:20:13,854 --> 00:20:16,156
Can I hold your hand...
for balance?

374
00:20:16,223 --> 00:20:18,224
Sure... for balance.

375
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:23,763
Haw-haw!

376
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,165
Sorry.

377
00:20:25,232 --> 00:20:26,800
Haw-haw!

378
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:27,968
Sorry.

379
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:33,106
Oh!

380
00:20:33,174 --> 00:20:34,441
Whoa! Oh!

381
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:39,279
"Mark Zuckerberg is..."

382
00:20:49,423 --> 00:20:51,291
- <i>Haw-haw!</i>
- <i>Sorry.</i>
