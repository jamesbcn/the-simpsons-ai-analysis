1
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:05,880
The Simpsons.

2
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:40,248
Well, you're certainly doing
your job today, Mr. Sun.

3
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,918
Oh, rats.

4
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,214
And here we have
the world-famous Beatles,

5
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,591
exactly as they looked

6
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,428
performing on
"The Ed Sullivan Show."

7
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,930
I hardly think it's fair
to be charged full price.

8
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,684
I'm up to my knees in the
original cast of "M.A.S.H."

9
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:03,772
Sunshine on my shoulders
makes me happy...

10
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,113
Homer, my hat goes off
to you.

11
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,616
It's cool in here, boy.

12
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,493
For the rest of the summer,

13
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,703
we can live inside
the refrigerator.

14
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,874
Homer, the fridge wasn't
meant to be used this way.

15
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,211
Although I must say,
it's certainly refreshing.

16
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,761
I got the idea
when I noticed

17
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,763
the refrigerator was cold.

18
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,389
Won't this overload the motor?

19
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,439
Marge, can you set
the oven to cold?

20
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,496
Ice cream! Ice cream!

21
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,669
I'm all out of ice cream!

22
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,752
It's true, you know.

23
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,755
Ice cream! Ice cream!

24
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,549
Fresh out of ice cream!

25
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:20,807
Chili! Red hot
Texas-style chili.

26
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:26,521
And we got ginger ale.
Boilin' hot Texas style ginger-ale...

27
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,856
Texas!

28
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,233
Aw, face it, Bart.

29
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,585
Our salvation isn't
just going to roll by

30
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,778
on the back
of some stupid truck.

31
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,910
Whoa!
I got to replace that window.

32
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,537
Pool-mobile?!

33
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,713
Look, Lisa, I snatched
five bathing suits.

34
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:52,964
All Martin's.

35
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,174
Take your best shot.

36
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,217
I'm wearing 17 layers.

37
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,558
I brought this on myself.

38
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,643
Okay, little dudes, time's up.

39
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,687
Everybody out!

40
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,984
- Time's up?!
- So long, Lis.

41
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,402
I'm gonna stowaway underwater,

42
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:17,155
and go where the pool goes.
Have a good life.

43
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,037
Sorry, Bart dude.

44
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,580
We got to fill this
with epsom salts

45
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,707
and jam it on over
to the old folks' home.

46
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,709
Oh, well. Same time
tomorrow, Otto?

47
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,753
No way, man.

48
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,756
One day of summer is
all we're budgeted for.

49
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,674
I guess it is
kind of a tease.

50
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,803
Dad.

51
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,682
Dad!

52
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:46,893
Dad!

53
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,102
Yes, Lisa.

54
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,230
Dad, as you know,
we've been swimming,

55
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,856
and we've developed
a taste for it.

56
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,691
We both agree that
getting our own pool

57
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,401
is the only way to go.

58
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,278
Now before you respond,
you must understand

59
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,448
that your refusal would result
in months and months of...

60
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,176
Can we have a pool, Dad?!
Can we have a pool, Dad?!

61
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,011
Can we have a pool, Dad?!
Can we have a pool, Dad?!

62
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,329
Can we have a pool, Dad?!
Can we...

63
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,580
I understand.

64
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,708
Let us celebrate
our new arrangement

65
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,044
with the adding
of chocolate to milk.

66
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,133
Over here we have
"The Hick Tub".

67
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,802
The "Insta-rust."

68
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,387
That's "The Lightning Magnet."

69
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,806
- That's "The Tinkler."
- Whoo! "The Tinkler."

70
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,308
I like the sound of that.
We'll take it.

71
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,979
Is it true should we wait at least
an hour after eating before we go in?

72
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,856
Look, question lady, this job
is not what I really do, okay?

73
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,983
I play keyboards.

74
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,624
All right.

75
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,584
Everybody in the pool!

76
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,671
'Tis a fine barn, but sure
'tis no pool, English.

77
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,754
D'oh-eth!

78
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,259
- Is it a pool yet?
- Yes, Dad.

79
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,342
Whoo-hoo!

80
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,345
Who could that be?

81
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:09,892
Uh, hello, uh,
Mrs., uh, Bart.

82
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,436
Is your pool ready yet?

83
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,945
Bart, are all these children
friends of yours?

84
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,740
Friends
and well-wishers, yes.

85
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,866
- Hey, Bart.
- Hiya, Bart.

86
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,200
- My buddy Bart.
- Hey, Bart.

87
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,286
Hello, Mrs. Cumberdale.

88
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,917
People! People!

89
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,420
It's time we all discussed
the pool safety rules.

90
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,464
Jump, Bart, jump!

91
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,424
Jump, Bart, jump!

92
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,051
You got it.

93
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,846
Hey, Bart,
your epidermis is showing!

94
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:47,930
It is?

95
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,935
Whoa...

96
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,812
See, epidermis
means your hair.

97
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,817
So, technically it's true.

98
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,361
That's what makes it
so funny.

99
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,987
Pardon me a moment.

100
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,909
Hey, Nelson,
he's really hurt.

101
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,994
I think he
broke his leg.

102
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,788
I said, "Ha-ha!"

103
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:30,139
Get this kid a magazine.
Stat.

104
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,976
I'm sorry, that leg's
gonna have to come off.

105
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,647
Did I say leg?

106
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,857
I meant that wet bathing suit.

107
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,111
I'm afraid you'll need a cast
on that broken bone.

108
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,905
Oh, I'm going to miss
the whole summer.

109
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,698
Don't worry, boy.

110
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,868
When you get a job like me,
you'll miss every summer.

111
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,704
Isn't it amazing the same day
you got a pool

112
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,957
is the same day we realized
we liked you?

113
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,334
The timing worked out great,
don't you think?

114
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,919
- Hi.
- Hi.

115
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,629
Hey, guys, sign my cast?

116
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,047
Sign my cast?

117
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,131
Guys?

118
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,302
Milhouse.

119
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,471
Uh... Hi, Bart.

120
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,181
Faithful Milhouse.

121
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,684
You'll spend the long,
hot days by my side,

122
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,060
won't you?

123
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,688
Oh, I think I lost
my glasses in your pool.

124
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,022
I better go in
and find them.

125
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,816
But you're wearing
your glasses.

126
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,151
No, I'm not.

127
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,947
Oh, look,
Bart's all alone.

128
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,490
Maybe I should
keep him company,

129
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,033
at least
for a little while.

130
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,327
- Lisa! Hey, look!
- Boy 2: Watch this!

131
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,752
Heh heh. Coming.

132
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,717
Well, it looks like it's
just you and me, Barty boy.

133
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,221
Oh, great, I get to spend
the summer with my brain.

134
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,532
What fun can you have
in a pool anyway

135
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,558
that you can't have
in a bathtub

136
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,935
with a garbage bag
taped around your cast?

137
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,103
Traitors.

138
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,730
Go on and have your pool.

139
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,483
I'm fine by myself right here.

140
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,584
You know, this isn't so bad.

141
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,086
I'll just spend the summer
getting better acquainted

142
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,505
with an old friend
called television.

143
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,053
Hope you enjoyed that, kids

144
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,347
'cause Krusty's out of here
for the summer.

145
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,349
In the meantime,
we'll be running...

146
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,228
Classic Krusty.

147
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,771
Enjoy.

148
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,152
Good evening.

149
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,572
Tonight my guest is AFL-CIO
chairman, George Meany,

150
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,157
who will be discussing

151
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,908
collective bargaining
agreements.

152
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,785
It's a pleasure
to be here, Krusty.

153
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,329
Let me be blunt.

154
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,123
Is there a labor crisis
in America today?

155
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,334
Well, that depends what
you mean by crisis.

156
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,589
Ah, there's nothing like
rising with the sun

157
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:36,260
for a quiet, peaceful dip
in your very own pool.

158
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
Whoo!

159
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,395
Lisa, the blob has got me.

160
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,606
Don't touch me,
or he'll get you too.

161
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,359
Dad, you have to put chlorine
in the water every day

162
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,943
to keep it clean.

163
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,404
Chlorine, eh?

164
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,618
Oh, my face is on fire.

165
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,163
Oh, look.
There's Bart.

166
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,414
Wave to him.

167
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,628
Hmm, maybe we should spend
more time with Bart.

168
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,631
He's becoming
isolated and weird.

169
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,467
I swear I don't know
where the bombs are.

170
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,636
Only the miners know that.

171
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,806
Maybe this will loosen your tongue.

172
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,557
Wha! No! Ah!

173
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,934
Uh, Bart?

174
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,060
Don't turn on
that light!

175
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,561
Sorry, I just came to see

176
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,605
- how you were feeling.
- I'm fine. Just fine.

177
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,691
What are you writing here?
A play?

178
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,067
Uh... No.

179
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,779
Yuh-huh. "Cast of characters:
Viceroy Fizzlebottom

180
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,947
a hearty cherub
of a man..."

181
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,948
Give me that.

182
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,700
It's a work in progress.

183
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,161
So, how do
you like being.

184
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,663
Miss Popularity?

185
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,249
Oh, well, you know,
it ain't so great.

186
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,645
Bart, it's the best thing
that ever happened to me

187
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,087
in my whole life!

188
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,047
Well, anyway I brought
you a present.

189
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,634
Look, it's the telescope
I won at the optics festival.

190
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,637
There was an optics festival,
and I wasn't informed?

191
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,763
- You go now.
- But...

192
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,847
Go!

193
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,686
What have we here?

194
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,981
"The Lighter Side of Hippies."

195
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,400
Ha ha! They don't care
whose toes they step on.

196
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,078
This was a lovely idea, Homie.

197
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,789
Come here and kiss me.

198
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,546
Do not be alarmed.

199
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,131
Continue swimming naked.

200
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,011
Aw, come on. Continue.

201
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,722
Come on. Aw...

202
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,640
All right, Lou. Open fire.

203
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,772
Wow.

204
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,982
The universe is so boring.

205
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,776
I know.

206
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,488
I'll use this to peer into
Springfield's seamy underbelly.

207
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,955
It turned out it was
his evil twin.

208
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,545
Grace, come here.

209
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,006
There's a sinister-looking kid
I want you to see.

210
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,594
I'm never ever going to see
anything interesting

211
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,721
with this stupid piece of junk.

212
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,521
That came from Flanders' house.

213
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,906
Oh, my God.

214
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:44,907
What have I done?

215
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,534
I've killed her.

216
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,453
Can't be what it looks like.

217
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,289
This is Flanders
we're talking about.

218
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,916
Nah, I'll just watch some TV.

219
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,293
Now, what you've been
waiting for.

220
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,712
Another long raga
by Ravi Shanker.

221
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,798
Shan-kar.

222
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,675
Shankar. Groovy, man.

223
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,978
Huh? Whoa!

224
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,646
This can't be what
it looks like.

225
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,648
There's got to be
some other explanation.

226
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:21,443
I wish there was
some other explanation for this.

227
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,903
But there isn't.

228
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,155
I'm a murderer.
I'm a murderer.

229
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,950
Then that's not
the real Ned Flanders.

230
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,953
I'm a murdiddly-erdler!

231
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,873
If that's not Flanders,
he's done his homework.

232
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,297
Daddy, where's Mommy?
We miss her.

233
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,925
Mommy... had to go away.
She's with God now.

234
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,177
Yay! Can we go there too?

235
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,470
Soon enough.

236
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,014
Yay!

237
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,559
He's going to kill
Rod and Todd too.

238
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,061
That's horrible...

239
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,145
in principle.

240
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,524
Look, Lisa.
I found this change

241
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,942
on the bottom
of the pool.

242
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,444
You can have it.

243
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,487
Thanks, Nelson.

244
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,991
Somebody took
my juice money!

245
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,786
Lisa, please join my family
for a weekend in the country.

246
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,538
There'll be hunting, charades,

247
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,042
and ever so many delightful
romantic misunderstandings.

248
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,505
They're only using you
for your pool, you know.

249
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,924
Shut up, brain!
I got friends now.

250
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,967
I don't need you anymore.

251
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:31,263
Duh... Yeah, I'd love
to go to your house.

252
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,436
Ah, my plan
has come to fruition.

253
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,897
Soon I'll be queen
of summertime.

254
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,315
Uh, king. King!

255
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,449
Dude, Buzz has it
an even wussier kid

256
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,118
has an even better pool
than this.

257
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,961
Hello?

258
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,046
Hey, I'm stuck in here.

259
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,423
I got to think
of a way to get out.

260
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,758
Well, well, well.

261
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,761
Look who's come crawling back.

262
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,806
Listen, Ned Flanders
murdered his wife.

263
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,266
But why?
She's such a fox.

264
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,143
I mean, what's
on Fox tonight?

265
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,979
Something ribald,
no doubt.

266
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,898
I wish you'd stop spreading
bad rumors about people.

267
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,359
Remember how you got Grampa
tarred and feathered?

268
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,361
Sure. That was
20 minutes ago.

269
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:31,031
Gonna be in the tub
for a while.

270
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,450
Bart, I'm really sorry I've
been ignoring you lately.

271
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,911
I got carried away
with being popular,

272
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,997
but now that I'm
unpopular again,

273
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,124
I want you to know
I'm here for you.

274
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,084
You can start making it up
to me right now.

275
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,752
Flanders is leaving
the house.

276
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,045
I want you to sneak in there

277
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,964
and bring me back
some evidence.

278
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,340
And something
sweet for later.

279
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,818
Bart, I'm here for you,
but I'm not gonna

280
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,135
break into
somebody's house.

281
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,761
All right.
You're right, you're right.

282
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,513
Let's just forget about that.
Here.

283
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,473
Let me read to you
from my play.

284
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,309
"'Kippers for breakfast, Aunt Helga?

285
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,312
Is it St. Swithen's
day already?'"

286
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,189
"'Tis, ' replied
Aunt Helga..."

287
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,525
I'm going, I'm going!

288
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,248
A human head!

289
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,128
Oh. Of course.

290
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,758
Oh, no. He's back.
Flanders is back.

291
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,134
Lisa, get out of there.

292
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,554
No, Lisa, don't go upstairs.
You'll be trapped!

293
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,559
An axe!
He's got an axe.

294
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,061
I'll save you, Lisa.

295
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:47,232
Uh, I'll save you
by calling the police.

296
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,443
Hello, and welcome to the Springfield.

297
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,278
Police Department resc-u-fone.

298
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,073
If you know the name of
the felony being committed,

299
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,574
press 1.

300
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,619
To choose from a list
of felonies, press 2.

301
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,496
If you are being murdered

302
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,939
or are calling
from a rotary phone,

303
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,999
please stay on the line.

304
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,753
You have selected "Regicide."

305
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,254
If you know the name

306
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,632
of the king or queen
being murdered, press 1.

307
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,559
I'll save you, cast or no cast.

308
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:29,399
Got to save Lisa,
trash can or no trash can.

309
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,082
Oh, no.

310
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,416
That sinister-looking kid

311
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
is coming to kill me.

312
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,129
Help! Help! Aah!

313
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,882
Mary had a little lamb.

314
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:58,554
Little lamb,
little lamb...

315
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,931
Oh, no. Oh, no...

316
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,428
It's time to put you away.

317
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,432
Put you away for good.

318
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,394
No!

319
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,191
Ho... what the gumdrops
is going on here?

320
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,775
I came to stop you
from murdering Lisa

321
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,277
like you murdered your wife.

322
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,487
Murdered?

323
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,160
Murdered?
Oh no, I've just been

324
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,328
in the country for a week.

325
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,571
But I distinctly
heard you say

326
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,289
that Maude was with God.

327
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,875
That's right.
I was at Bible camp.

328
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,211
I was learning
how to be more judgmental.

329
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,480
But I saw the murder,
and then I saw you bury the corpse

330
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,881
in the backyard.

331
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:19,134
All right, it's true.
I am a murderer.

332
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,971
I over-watered Maude's
favorite ficus plant,

333
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,932
I panicked and then
I buried the remains.

334
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,892
I was hoping to replace it

335
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,769
before you got home.

336
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,938
But I heard a woman scream.

337
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,607
Huh? Well, now,
that I can't explain.

338
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,690
Found it, chief.

339
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,112
Oh. Well, I guess that
explains everything.

340
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,281
Not everything.

341
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,741
There's still
the little matter

342
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,576
of the whereabouts
of your wife.

343
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,994
Um, I'm right here.

344
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,913
Oh, I see.
Then everything is wrapped up

345
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,374
in a neat little package.

346
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,918
Really, I mean that.

347
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,337
Sorry if it sounded sarcastic.

348
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,009
More friends! More allies!

349
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,678
More, I say!

350
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,346
Hang those who talk of less!

351
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,807
There's a few inches
over here! Ho!

352
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,857
My precious pool

353
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,403
and its lifestyle
accoutrements. No!

354
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,238
Out of here.

355
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,500
The gentle caress
