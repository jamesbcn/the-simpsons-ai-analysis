No, just mailing out death certificates

{\an8}Oh, no.

{\an8}No, no, I felt that.

69
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,342
Sir, why did you wait
until the last minute

70
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,762
to pay your taxes?

71
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,930
Taxes? Isn't this the line for Metallica?

72
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,100
Sir, why did you wait
until the last minute

73
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,349
to pay your taxes?

74
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,060
Because I'm an idiot. Happy?

75
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,641
{\an8}Of course, not everyone is an idiot.

76
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,687
{\an8}Some of us took our receipts and pay stubs

77
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,521
{\an8}to our accountants months ago--

78
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,896

a little smug...

79
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,113

00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,113

83
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,041

Dad...

85
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,913
What is it, sweetie?

86
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,746
Did you see a scary picture
in your picture book?

87
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,382
That was last year's taxes.

88
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,169
You have to pay again this year.

89
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,883
{\an8}No. Because, you see, I went ahead and...

90
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,125
{\an8}Year-wise, I was counting forward

91
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,717
{\an8}from the last previous...

92
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,602
D'oh!

93
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,769
{\an8}I put the tax forms on top
of your "to do" pile a month ago.

94
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,062
{\an8}I have a "to do" pile?

96
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,273
Marge, how many kids do we have?

97
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,105
No time to count, I'll just estimate.

98
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,110
Uh, nine.

99
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,111
You know we don't have...

100
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,322
Shut up! Shut up!

101
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,862
If I don't hear you, it's not illegal.

102
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,945
OK. I need some deductions...
deductions...

103
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,120
Oh, business gifts.

104
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,198
Here you go. Keep using nuclear power.

105
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,794
Homer, I painted that for <i>you </i>.

106
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,749
OK, Marge, if anyone asks, you require

107
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,620
24-hour nursing care, Lisa's a clergyman,

108
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,917
Maggie is seven people
and Bart was wounded in Vietnam.

109
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:53,921

125
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,017
you pull a thorn out of the Pope's butt

126
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,404
and he grants you one wish. What'll it be?

127
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,112
Hm! Only one, huh?

128
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,403
Well, I've always wondered
what it would feel like

129
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,618
to wear something that's been ironed.

130
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,368
-(whistles)
-That would be sweet.

131
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,660
What about you, Moe?

132
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,873
Uh, gee, I was going to say a night

but an ironed shirt...

134
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,422
Damn, that's tempting.

135
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,629
What about you, Homer?

136
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,668
Well...

137
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,922
Homer Simpson?

138
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,173
United States Government.

139
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,674
Hmm?

140
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,336
Help! Somebody!

141
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,804
-Help!
-(door closes)

142
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,054
So how about you, Barn?

143
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,135
One wish.

144
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,521
This is an egregious
miscarriagement of taxitude.

145
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,605
Oh, this is bad, this is really bad.

146
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,188
You work and you slave
and you steal just enough

147
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,944
for a sweet lick of that shiny brass ring.

148
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,777
Don't I get a lick?
Doesn't Gil get a lick?

149
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,906
Simpson... Homer J.

150
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,451
(whimpering)

151
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,985
(creaking)

152
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,658
Hey, put in a good word
for old Gil, would ya?

153
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,252
MILLER: Mr. Simpson,
this government computer

154
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,594
can process over nine tax returns per day.

155
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,920
Did you really think you could fool it?

156
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,835
No, sir. I'm really sorry, sir.

157
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,634
An older boy told me to do it.

158
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,007
You're looking at five years, minimum.

159
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,555
No, sir, please.

160
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,928
I can't go to prison.

161
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,234
{\an8}They pee in a cup and throw it on you.

162
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,058
{\an8}I saw it in a movie.

163
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,444
You won't be seeing any prison movies

164
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,941
where you're going... Prison.

165
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:23,152
No, please! I'll do anything.

166
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,242
Anything? Well, that's a start.

167
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,320
Agent Johnson, FBI.

168
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,736
{\an8}(sobbing) I'm very happy to meet you.

169
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,615
{\an8}From now on, you're going to work for us.

170
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,502
(whispering) OK, but could you
pay me under the table?

171
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,960
I got a little tax problem.

172
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,591
They want you to spy on your friends?

173
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,671
Not spy, squeal.

174
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,006
I've got no choice.

175
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,641
The government has no right
to use you this way.

176
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,759
{\an8}Quiet, honey, you don't know
how big this government is.

177
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,927
{\an8}It goes all the way to the President.

178
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,016
(grunting)

179
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,850
{\an8}There you go, ratboy.

180
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,265
{\an8}Does this make me look fat?

181
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,943
{\an8}No. It makes you look like a tool

182
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,022
{\an8}-of government oppression.
-But not fat.

183
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,202
If my cover gets blown

184
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,778
and I need help, what's the signal?

185
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,580
Oh...

186
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,366
Hey, I see you're watching the ball game.

187
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,004
Looks like a good one.

188
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,500
Any of you involved
in any illegal activity?

189
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,083
'Cause I could sure go for some.

190
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,998
Oh, God!

191
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,296
How about you, Lenny?

192
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,009
Testing, testing... Lenny?

193
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,429
You saying you
want to commit a crime, Homer?

194
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,139
{\an8}Maybe. But first I need to
hear about some other crimes

195
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,681
{\an8}to get me fired up.

196
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,934
You mean like the time

197
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,975
you was runnin' moonshine
out of your basement?

198
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,769
Or that telemarketing scam you pulled?

199
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,153
Uh, um, like those.

200
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,691
But involving <i>you </i>.

201
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,114
You mean like the time

202
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,742
Barney beat up George Bush.

203
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,238
Barney? That was me!

204
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,701
And I'd do it again.

205
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,991
Why stop there, Homer?

206
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,334
My militia has a secret plan

207
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,328
to beat up all sorts
of government officials.

208
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,210
That'll teach them to drag their feet
on high-definition TV.

209
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,003
You're under arrest for conspiracy.

210
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,463
(gasping)

211
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,553
Hey, how did they finger Charlie?

212
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,918
Somebody must have ratted him out.

213
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:11,085
Oh, that's ridiculous, Moe.
End transmission.

214
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,755
(ducks quacking)

215
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,604
My superiors were pleased with your work.

216
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,432
You have a flair for treachery.

217
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,517
Well, I'm just glad it's all over.

218
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,522
{\an8}(laughs) Oh, you're not through, Simpson.

219
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,404
{\an8}We have a high-risk assignment for you.

220
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,231
{\an8}Why do you keep picking on me?

221
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,936
{\an8}Marge's name was on that tax return, too.

222
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,857
{\an8}-Let's take a walk.
-Walk?

223
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,236
(grunts)

224
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,282
That wasn't part of the deal.

225
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,369

226
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,163

hidden somewhere in his house.

262
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,934
But all we've ascertained
from satellite photos

263
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,725
is that it's not on the roof.

265
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,519
you can help lead us to it.

266
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,404
{\an8}But Mr. Burns gave me my job.

267
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,691
{\an8}And he hasn't fired me

268
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,324
{\an8}even after three meltdowns
and one China syndrome.

269
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,112
{\an8}I can't betray him.

270
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,355
I'm afraid you have no choice.

271
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,617

293
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,971
What a pleasant surprise.

294
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,801
Hmm, a pack of vicious dogs

295
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,638

296
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,354
Uh, I don't know what to tell you.

297
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,274
Very well. Come on in.

298
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,272
Perhaps I have something
I can scald you with.

299
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,111
It'll, uh, be a few minutes.

300
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,074
So, what brings you to my home?

301
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,655
Well, Mr. Burns, you always come off

302
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,831
as kind of a gruff, crotchety loner,

303
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,951
but we both know that deep down inside...

Ya, ha!

305
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,291
Still cold.

00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,134
Hmm, well, let me get you a towel.

00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,549

00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,118

317
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,668

324
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,096
Well, of course I didn't want a racehorse

325
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,311
in my living room, but you don't say no

326
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,692
to Spring Byington, do you?

327
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,598

Franklin Jefferson Burns

336
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,116
tossing that tea without a care

337
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,705
For what the caffeine would
do to the Fenway flounder.

338
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,251
-Is that a fish?
-It was.

Ho-ho! That's me, all right.

343
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,599
It commemorates my liberation

344
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,388
of a trillion dollars that would have been

345
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,851
foolishly squandered.

346
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,730
Let's move.

00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:53,928

bill in his hand?!

(chuckling)

350
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,653
That would be pretty
careless of me, wouldn't it?

351
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,243
I keep the real bill right here.

352
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,399
(velcro ripping)

353
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,816
{\an8}Wow.

354
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,235
{\an8}That must be worth a fortune!

355
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,744
-(guns cocking)
-Nobody move!

356
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:10,735
What the...?

357
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,826
Montgomery Burns, you're under arrest

358
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,422
for grand, grand, grand, grand larceny.

359
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,168
(strains) I'm not the thief.

360
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,710
The government is.

361
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,753
Every year, you make hardworking Joes

362
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,757
like my reporter friend
here pay income taxes.

363
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,010
And for what?

364
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,261
Aid to ungrateful foreigners.

365
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,514
Do-nothing nuclear missiles.

366
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,136
{\an8}Tomb polish for some unknown soldier.

367
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,234
{\an8}Hey, he's right!

368
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,770
You crooks in Washington...

369
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,563
Put a sock in it, punk.

370
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,357
Ooh, you can silence me

371
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,030
but you can't silence <i>Collier's Magazine!</i>

372
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,739
Tell the people! Don't let the government
push you around!

373
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,780
{\an8}You have a choice! Fight back!

374
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,784
{\an8}I'm going to write
the best darn article...

375
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:52,787
{\an8}Oh. Wait.

376
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,408
(grunting)

377
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,905
(all grunting)

378
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,996
Huh! Take that, Uncle Sam!

379
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,510
{\an8}(giggling)

380
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,522
(tires screeching)

381
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,812
Faster, Simpson.

382
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,355
Those jack-booted g-men
won't be far behind.

383
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,319
We'll hide out at my place. I've got beer.

384
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,110
{\an8}No! We need help.

385
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,323
{\an8}There's only one man

386
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,823
{\an8}who can get us out of a jam like this.

387
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:33,445
<i>♪ You'll be swell, you'll be great ♪</i>

388
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,334
<i>♪ Gonna have the whole</i>
<i>world on a plate... ♪</i>

389
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,831
(doorbell chiming)

390
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,583
All right, all right.

391
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,915
Keep your top on.

392
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,375
Why, sir, what a pleasant...

393
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,841
(screams)

394
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,764
So now our own government
is hunting us down

395
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,052
like a couple of common snow leopards.

396
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,796
It's an outrage, sir.

397
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,270
<i>This is Agent Johnson from the FBI.</i>

398
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:01,769
<i>Be on the lookout for a 1936</i>
<i>maroon Stutz Bearcat.</i>

399
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,185
Eh, that really was more of a burgundy.

400
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,235
Oh, we're never going to make it.

401
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,648
Let's just divide up the trillion now

402
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,947
and go our separate ways.

403
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,870
Uh, I'm afraid we've got
to get out of the country.

404
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,029
Capital idea.

405
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,247
{\an8}Let's blow this fascist popsicle stand.

406
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,828
{\an8}We'll purchase a small island somewhere

407
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,463
{\an8}and start our own country

408
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,840
{\an8}free from the relentless
tyranny of Uncle Sam.

409
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,588
{\an8}But I can't leave the country.

410
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,920
{\an8}What about my wife and kids?

411
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,086
That can be shipped.

412
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,724
JOHNSON: OK, kids,

413
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,510
I want some answers.

414
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,224
Where do you think your father would go

415
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,724
with a trillion dollars?

416
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,515
{\an8}My dad has a trillion dollars?

417
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,769
{\an8}Wow! I can buy and sell your sorry ass.

418
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,852
I'll give you a billion dollars

419
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,056
to empty the cat box for me.

420
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,856
No, no, Bart.

421
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,359
That money's going towards
your college education.

422
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,942
Who needs college, Mom?

423
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,447
We're trillionaires!

424
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,408
Let's buy dune buggies.

425
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,699
Contact.

426
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,155
Remove the chocks, Simpson!

427
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,457
Simpson?

428
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:07,915
(gasps)

429
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,593
Ohh!

430
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,052
BURNS: There's soda on the plane!

431
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,755
{\an8}Attention, fugitives.

432
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,966
<i>You are leaving U.S. jurisdiction.</i>

433
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,477
<i>Turn back immediately</i>

434
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,098
<i>or we will be unable to prosecute you.</i>

435
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,765
We'd better do what he says.

436
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,483
Wait. We're now over international waters.

437
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,574
Woo-hoo! We can gamble!

438
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,820
Yes!

439
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,703
{\an8}Aw, nuts!

440
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,200
{\an8}They'll be back. They'll miss American TV.

441
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,116
Any of these islands would
make a fine new country.

442
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,874
-I call President.
-Vice-president.

443
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:44,956
Ohh...

444
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,750
Ooh. There's a big one.

445
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,335
And it has "freedom" written all over it.

446
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,420
Sir, that's Cuba.

447
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,626
Cuba, eh?

448
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,375
Take her down, Smithers.

449
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,137
Uh... You're flying the plane, sir.

450
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,350
Excellent.

451
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,176
Sorry about the landing, boys.

452
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,597
This fog is so thick
I can't see my own cataracts.

453
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,781
Uh... Purpose of visit?

454
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,704
Oh, you're going to love
it in Cuba, Marge.

455
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,242
{\an8}There's shredded pork everywhere.

456
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,156
{\an8}(speaking in a foreign language)
<i>Es carne de burro.</i>

457
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,655
{\an8}Nice to meet <i>you.</i>

458
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,037
Ah, the new Packard we've been hearing
so much about.

459
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,049
(engine misfires)

460
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,840
-(bell dings)
-(crowd cheering)

461
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:39,967
-Oof!
-Oof!

462
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,313
{\an8}CROWD: Boo!

463
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,103
So you say Batista's gone.

464
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,568
-Did you know that?
-I had no idea.

465
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,608
In that case, just take us

466
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,282
to whoever's in charge.

467
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,490
CASTRO: Comrades,

468
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,951
our nation is completely bankrupt.

469
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,782
We have no choice but
to abandon communism.

470
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:03,908
(groaning)

471
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,624
I know. I know. I know.

472
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,334
But we all knew from day one
this mumbo jumbo wouldn't fly.

473
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,876
(grumbling)

474
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,669
I'll call Washington
and tell them they won.

475
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:17,094
But, <i>Presidente, </i>America
tried to kill you.

476
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,554
Ah, they're not so bad.

477
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,514
They even named a street
after me in San Francisco.

478
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,255
(whispering)

479
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,637
It's full of <i>what?!</i>

480
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,723
(panting)

481
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,637
<i>Presidente, </i>three men are here to see you.

482
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,977
They claim to have a trillion-dollar bill.

483
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,563
<i>Ay caramba!</i>

484
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,438
Oh, so the island's not for sale, eh?

485
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,446
Well, will you at least permit us to live

486
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,448
in your socialist paradise?

487
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,450
Are you talking about Cuba?

488
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,702
Exactly. All we ask is

489
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,405
preferential treatment
because of my fabulous wealth.

490
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,536
May I see?

491
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,622
Oh-ho-ho!

492
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,626
See with your eyes, not with your hands.

493
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,088
Please, we are all amigos here.

494
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,009
Mr. Burns, I think we can trust

495
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,339
the President of Cuba.

496
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,180
Now give it back.

497
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,564
Give what back?

498
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,930
Ohh...

499
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,936
It's hard to believe there's a place

500
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:16,151
worse than America, but we found it.

501
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,493
Yes, I, too, feel renewed appreciation

502
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,238
for the good old U.S. of A.

503
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,410
{\an8}Oppression and harassment
are a small price to pay

504
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,030
{\an8}to live in the land of the free.

505
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,738
But, uh, sir, aren't you facing

506
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,578
some serious jail time?

507
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,753
Well, if it's a crime
to love one's country,

508
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,383
then I'm guilty.

509
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,629
{\an8}And if it's a crime to steal
a trillion dollars from our government

510
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,463
{\an8}and hand it over to communist Cuba,

511
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,088
{\an8}then I'm guilty of that, too.

512
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,925
And if it's a crime to bribe a jury,

513
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:49,772
then, so help me,
I'll soon be guilty of that.

514
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,520
God bless America!

515
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,985
(theme music playing)

516
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:39,862
Shh!
