Okay, Dad, I'm ready for
Take Your Daughter to Work Day.

{\an8}How come there's never
a Take Your Son to Work Day?

{\an8}Well, despite all that,
today's going to be fun, Dad!

16
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,676
{\an8}Will there be lots
of other girls there?

17
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,812
{\an8}Just a few. For some reason,
there's been a lot

18
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,309
{\an8}of infertility
at the nuclear plant.

{\an8}Dad, what does that do?

32
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,218
{\an8}-I don't know.
-Who's that guy?

33
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,928
{\an8}-I don't know.
-Where do those pipes lead?

34
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,428
{\an8}Not sure.

35
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,050
{\an8}Is it called the cooling tower
because there's...

36
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,096
{\an8}-Not my department.
-How many kilowatts are...?

37
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,640
{\an8}Look, sweetie,
would you like to go

38
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,603
{\an8}to the cafeteria
and get some ice cream?

39
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,563
{\an8}-How many kinds are there?
-Twelve.

40
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,274
{\an8}Curse that Elon Musk!

41
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,154
{\an8}Thanks to that Earth-smooching
buttinski,

42
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,571
{\an8}I'm on the verge of bankruptcy.

43
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,399
{\an8}All I have left
are the clothes on my back

44
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,154
{\an8}and the clones in my freezer.

45
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:54,156
{\an8}43 is missing again.

46
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,699
{\an8}I had to replace my beloved hounds
with teacup poodles.

47
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,414
{\an8}It's pathetic. Watch.

48
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,004
{\an8}Release the hounds.

49
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,999

50
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,500
{\an8}(chuckling)
Aw.

51
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,245
{\an8}No. Help. Oh, stop.

52
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,205
{\an8}Oh, spare me.

53
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,795
{\an8}And all I got from Mr. Musk
was an electric car,

54
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,841
{\an8}which I charge by stealing power
from my nosy neighbor.

55
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,852
{\an8}Hey, dippily-do, neighbor-oni!

56
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,435
{\an8}Stupid Branson.

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,110
{\an8}But I have a new scheme

58
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:30,438
{\an8}that will undo the terrible damage
done by my other schemes.

59
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,355
I have an appointment
with a Nigerian King

60
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:35,613
to negotiate a uranium deal
that will put me right back on top.

61
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,527
Nothing can stop you, sir.

62
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,582
But, uh, not that you're not
at the top of your game.

63
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,581
Uh, what if you
don't get the deal?

64
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,043
I'll just have
to sell everything

65
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,713
and move
to the South Pacific with you.

66
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,291
What a grim fate
that would be.

67
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,051
And with your omelet,

68
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,549
would you like the fried potatoes
or the mixed berries?

69
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,093
I'll have the berries.

70
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,348
Ah.

71
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,020
A terrible fate indeed, sir.

72
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:09,015
Oh, no. My almond milk
leaked all over everything.

73
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,685
Dad, do you have anything
I can eat?

74
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,904
Hmm?

75
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,616
Oh, uh, I will turn this corn chip
into a wonderful meal,

76
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,908
using my greatest skill--
lunchroom trading!

77
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,243
Shut your eyes.

("The Thieving Magpie"

79
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,297
Pretty impressive, Homer.

80
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,012
But what about
the presentation?

81
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:41,512
The eyes taste first, then lips,
then palate.

82
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,096
Then the body's harshest critic--
the colon.

(Rossini's "Thieving Magpie" plays)

84
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,864
Okay, sweetie,
open those baby blacks.

Welcome, Your Majesty.

89
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,301
Mr. Burns, I don't know
what you have heard,

90
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,130
but I do not eat monkey brains
from a skull.

91
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,126
Oh, this is for me.

92
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,467
Before we begin,
I have a favor to ask.

93
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,385
My daughter is traveling with me.

94
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,807
Hello.

95
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,555
She is my true treasure.

96
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,897
During our complicated
negotiations,

97
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,993
I need someone
to look after her,

98
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,488
keep her out of trouble.

99
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,574
Hmm.

100
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,617
That man is the perfect choice.

101
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,616
What?!
Sir, that's Homer Simpson.

102
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,168
You forgot that
he's the most incompetent...

103
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,795
(both laughing)

104
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,550
Homer Simpson
would be perfect.

105
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,183
Simpson, all you have to do
is babysit the princess--

106
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,596
keeping her in this hotel room
during the negotiations.

107
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,145
Babysitting, eh?

108
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,018
What do I know about kids?

109
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:17,855
Homer Simpson, I give you
Princess Kemi of Nigeria!

110
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,152
Watch that girl like a hawk.

111
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,492
(screams)

112
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,414
Princess, why'd you put on
that coat?

113
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,582
You're obviously cold.

114
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,751
May I escort you
to the radiator?

115
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,580
No. I want to go out.

116
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,245
I'm 25 years old.

117
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,634
(phone ringing)

118
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,840
Uh, just a second.

119
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,049
Hey, Marge.
Yeah, I'm working late.

120
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,670
Yup, special project.

121
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,967
Lenny said you
were babysitting,

122
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,761
and if you are babysitting,

123
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,144
why can't you do some at home?

124
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,850
I could use a night out.

125
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,390
Sorry, Marge,
but I am the royal babysitter.

126
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,225
If I start watching commoners,

127
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,940
the tongues of the court
will be awag.

128
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,941
Really? Awag?

129
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,863
Really?
Well, if you think that...

130
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,901
-(beeps off)
-I want to go out

131
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,235
and see the America
whose greatest cities

132
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,571
I've only seen
destroyed in movies.

133
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,406
I see. You want excitement.

134
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:12,292
Princess, have you ever heard of
Studio 54, CBGBs, the Roxbury?

135
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,792
Yes! I've dreamed of...

136
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,253
All gone.

137
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,293
But in their place, we have
500 channels of television.

138
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,748
All awesome.

139
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,547
Sit down, and I'll show you.

140
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,599
So, all these concubines belong
to this one tyrant?

141
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,390
He's called "The Bachelor."

142
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,644
Please let me go out.

143
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,886
All right, Princess.

144
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:38,937
I'll take you to a place
that's fun with a capital "F."

145
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,033
(grunting)

146
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,440
Moe, this is Kemi.

147
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,028
She's an honest-to-God princess.

148
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,284
Ah, really?
Hey, tell me something.

149
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,946
I heard that Queen Elizabeth in person
is actually not that funny.

150
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,446
I am from Africa.

151
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,658
Wow, Africa.

152
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,997
I had a good friend
who really wanted to go there.

153
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,043
So, uh, you speak
English there?

154
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,877
I speak five languages.

155
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,302
(sputters)
Nobody does.

156
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,550
(speaking Portuguese)

157
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,052
(speaking French)

158
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,804
(speaking Spanish)

159
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,345
(speaking Japanese)

160
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,970
Uh, which means what?

161
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,386
"I don't wish to show off."

162
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,135
Yeah, that's pretty good there,

163
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,267
uh, but don't expect me
to bow and scrape.

164
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,984
Uh, well,
I'll give you one scrape.

165
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,324
Yeah, that's it, Majesty.

166
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,990
Notice I didn't say "Your."

167
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,568
(laughs)

168
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,663
Oh, they don't make them
like you in Nigeria.

169
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,278
Nigeria?

170
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,405
Homer, can I speak to you
in private?

171
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,945
(grunting)

172
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,407
Can I try it?

173
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,917
Ah, you got to be mad
at something.

174
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,669
Well, I'm mad I'm not doing it.

175
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,922
Okay, I'll tell you why I'm mad.

176
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,674
A few months back,
I got an unsolicited e-mail

177
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,126
from an actual Nigerian prince.

<i>The prince needed to transfer</i>
<i>$40 million out of the country.</i>

00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,477
<i>He offered to split that with me</i>

181
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,189

-Ze-ro.

188
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,790
Get out of here!

189
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,121
If Kemi there
is a Nigerian princess,

190
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,747
her brother just might be
the Nigerian prince

191
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,594
that took my money!

Listen, Moe, I'm Kemi's guardian.

She and I are going back
to the hotel now!

194

(gasps)
She's gone!

195
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,095
And she trashed my bar!

196
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,101
Oh, no, wait.
She actually cleaned up a little bit.

197
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,353
Yeah, good for her.

Chief, thank God!

00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:47,861
I was drinking at Moe's,
and I lost an African princess!

200
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,954
Lost African princess, eh?

201
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,779
Well,
lucky for you, she just happens

202
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,784
to be in the back of my cruiser.

203
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,536
Yes! The prayer I forgot to say
has been answered.

204
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,116
What the...?

205
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,786
You're going straight
to the drunk tank, rummy.

206
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,955
"African princess."

00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,801
Chief, I just saw someone
robbin' the Kwik-E-Mart!

209
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,512
Oh, now African princesses
are robbing the Kwik-E-Mart, huh?

210
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,764
Get in the car, booze bag.

211
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,926
Chief, I have been shot
in the shoulder!

212
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,475
In the car!

213
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,729
What is this, St. Patrick's Day?

214
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,311
Why, this is terrible.

215
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,766
Can't even think of anything
to mumble to myself.

216
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,816
That's how upset I am here.

217
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,950
Hello. First of all,
I wanted to pay.

218
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:34,908
Also... maybe...
I wanted to talk more to you?

219
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,371
Really?

220
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,911
<i>Okay there, Moe,</i>
<i>you got to get to the brother,</i>

221
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,576
<i>because he knows what</i>

222
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,995
Yeah, duly noted.

223
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,633
Uh, so, Your Tootsieness,
tell me about your family.

224
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,802
Got any aunts, uncles,
cousins, sisters...

225
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,300
brothers?

226
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,132
I have a brother.
Yes. One.

227
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,717
I see.

228
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,802
<i>Now, Moe,</i>
<i>don't jump to conclusions.</i>

229
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,557
<i>A lot of people have brothers.</i>

230
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,269
-Does he have a computer?
-Yes.

231
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,809
<i>MOE: It's him!</i>

Guys,

233
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,807
thanks for bailing me out,

234
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,435
but I still have
a huge problem.

235
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,942
Well, till we find her,

236
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,824
maybe we could get somebody
to pretend to be her.

237
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,611
You know, get a nice wig
and a dress.

238
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:17,276
Oh, no, I am not dressing up
like an African princess.

239
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,406
I am not! I am not! I am not!

240
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:23,004
Thank you for listening
to my objections.

241
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,420
Well,
you were really vehement.

242
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,708
(phone ringing)

243
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,671
Uh, hello, Simpson.
Just checking up.

244
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,342
May I speak
with the princess?

245
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,130
Um, yeah, sure. Uh...

246
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,973
(high-pitched Southern accent)
Hello, this is the princess.

247
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:37,349
I'm with Homer Simpson,
and I do declare he's wonderful.

248
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,848
Oh, that's right,
I'm from South Africa.

249
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,600
Fiddle-dee-dee.

250
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,732
Well, sounds like everything's
going just the way I want it.

251
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,730
Yeah, so all my money's
tied up in this "jernt."

252
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,613
Can't even afford
elocution lessons

253
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,780
to teach me how
to pronounce "joint."

254
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,489
I guess I could do it online,
but, uh, what's the "pernt"?

255
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,570
(laughs)

256
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,985
What-What's so funny?

257
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,283
I thought my English
was perfect,

258
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,827
but you make me feel
even better about it.

259
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,041
(chuckles)

260
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,080
Eh, usually people that tease me
get thrown out on their ass.

261
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,455
But, uh, your sayin' it
made me feel good.

262
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,212
Geez, I sound like one
of those guys in them rom coms

263
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:14,915
that play at the theaters
next to the theater I'm in. Heh.

264
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:19,007
So, uh, what's a "princessess"
like you, uh, do all day, huh?

265
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,255
A lot of spinning wheels
and witches treating you like crap?

266
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,478
I read. Are you familiar
with the books

267
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,478
by my countryman Chinua Achebe,

268
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,020
<i>Things Fall Apart</i> and <i>No Longer At Ease?</i>

269
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,855
Hey, you guys got real
optimistic literature there.

270
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,611
(giggles)
Fair comment.

271
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,914
(yawns)
I haven't eaten all day.

272
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,028
Well, don't eat those eggs!
Uh, we don't know

273
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,696
what kind of bird
they turn into.

274
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,744
But there's
a string cheese or something

275
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,458
in the fridge in the back.
Uh, help yourself.

276
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,379
All right, after she eats,
I'd better close up.

277
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,168
(yawns)
Oh. Come on, pal.

278
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,344
(grunts)
Come on.

279
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,175
That's really stuck there good.

280
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:07,234
Ah, I can't be mad
at her no more.

281
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,485
Good night, moon.

282
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,202
Good night, broom.

283
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,122
Good night, jukebox
that won't play a tune.

284
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,451
Good night, eggs.

285
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,946
Good night, dregs.

286
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,707
Good night, bugs
crawlin' up my legs.

287
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,290
Good night, beer.
Good night, mice.

288
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:35,456
Good night, princess
who treats me nice.

289
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,876
Yeah.

290
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,974
(yawns)

291
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:47,558
So my offer
for one ton of your uranium

292
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,731
is a goat.

293
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,229
Will you stop offering me that?

294
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,981
I come from a modern nation
of 90 million people.

295
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,573
-Two goats.
-You are starting to insult me.

296
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,189
All right,
let's cut to the chase.

297
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,816
My board has given me permission
to go up to 12 goats.

298
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,815
(grumbles)

299
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,695
-How about here, sir?
-Looks good to me.

300
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,208
I'm so sorry
I pretended not to be gay

301
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,880
for all those years.

302
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,048
Well, better an old queen
than never a queen at all.

303
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,458
(chuckles)

304
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,343
Pay attention.
My last offer:

305
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,836
20 million goats.

306
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,718
Okay, but no dogs
disguised as goats.

307
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,056
Oh, great,
here comes the haggling.

308
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,479
Well, well, look who's up. Heh.

309
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,611
Uh, Princess, I'm gonna
do something for you

310
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:38,108
I've never done for anyone in this bar.
Call you a cab.

311
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,652
No. I want to spend time with you.

312
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,276
I want to see this town.

313
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,243
Do you mind
ridin' a cute little scooter

314
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,833
with your arms around my waist?

315
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,078
I don't.

316
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,659

Just go and go fast.

You know, like,
"Hey. Thank you for flying Air Kevin.

If you look out to the left
of the pedicab, you..."

335
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,474
Just move the pedals.

336
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,517
Whoa, sounds like the tower

337
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,231

347
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,710
where Dave Grohl got mugged.

348
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:23,173
I have to leave,
but I still had a wonderful day.

349
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,795
<i>MOE: Thank God I shaved</i>
<i>my forehead this morning.</i>

350
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,183
-(shutter clicks)
-(gasps)

351
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,299
A paparazzo?
Please don't send that.

352
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,096
If my father sees it,
it will ruin my life.

353
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,681
Well, thanks for making it so easy.

354
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,447
And you have
the 20 million goats?

355
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,699
Two, now.

356
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,241
19,999,998

357
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,696
on delivery.

358
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,996
-Very good.
-Um, shouldn't we

359
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,410
see how the princess is doing

360
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,168
before you sign,
Your Majesty?

361
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,789
What are you talking about,
Smithers?

362
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:01,996
(phone dings)

363
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,092
(gasps)
I can't even trust you

364
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,882
to watch an impetuous adult
who does what she wants?

365
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,217
The deal is off.

366
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,472
<i>SMITHERS: Wow.</i>
<i>After spending my life serving others,</i>

367
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,644
<i>I'm finally gonna get what I want.</i>

368
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,393
Uh, sir, there may be a bright side.

369
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,225
There's never a bright side.

370
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,060
<i>SMITHERS:</i>
<i>(chuckles) He's almost mine.</i>

371
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,571
Yes, you've torn that up,
all right.

372
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,454
Father, I want to explain.

373
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,411
I was a young woman
who wanted to see the world,

374
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,832
and this kind man
has shown it to me.

375
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,661
And stolen your heart.

376
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,246
Eh, well, that's what I do.

377
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,291
Uh, sorry, but there ain't
no off switch for this.

378
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,717
(laughs)
He has not stolen my heart.

379
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,968
Wha?!

380
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,260
Why has he made the ancient
tribal sound of confusion?

381
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,925
I think he is a sweet,
sweet man.

382
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,635
But when I kissed him
on the forehead,

383
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,095
it was not romantic.

384
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,274
More like when
Snow White kissed Dopey.

385
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,523
Oh, no, no,
not this comparison again.

386
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,026
I'm sorry, Moe.
I don't love you.

387
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,109
But I really like you.

388
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,235
Well, daughter, even though
you have done nothing seriously wrong,

389
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,873
first I will tear this contract
one more time.

390
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,121
(grunts)

391
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,912
And as for you,
your punishment will be...

392
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,497
Uh, may I speak to you,
Majesty,

393
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,043
father to father?

394
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,246
A woman has allowed you
to sire her children?

395
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,797
There was beer involved.
I have two daughters.

396
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,092
And I've learned you have
to let them go their own way.

397
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,887
Even the one-year-old.

398
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,181
Majesty.

399
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,345
And the older one,
I can't tell her what to do.

400
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,345
-And she's only 12.
-Eight.

401
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,267
See what I mean?
Always an argument.

402
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,775
Hmm.

403
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,648
But the thing you
have to remember is

404
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,815
that you have to let
them be who they are

405
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,824
because you love them.

406
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,196
I am not convinced.

407
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:58,622
Uh, because you
want them to grow.

408
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,162
Still not convinced.

409
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,115
Then because you can't
strangle a girl.

410
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,787
That makes sense.

411
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,955
-Oh...
-Come here, Daughter.

412
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,634
Oh, Father.

413
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,712
Little girl, let me
give you some advice.

414
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,588
Never dream big, because
it will blow up in your face.

415
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,885
You're talking to the girl

416
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,718
who wants a career in jazz.

417
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,064
Oh, poor thing.

418
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,059
So the good king's
cheap uranium will

419
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,191
allow me to sell you
expensive nuclear power.

420
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,898
Everyone wins.

421
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,228
Yes, yes. Princess.

422
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,983
Can you tell us about
the man you kissed?

423
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,356
Uh, yeah, I'll field that.

424
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,153
Uh, yesterday,
a local man

425
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,527
"may or may not"
have given a tour

426
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,834
to a certain princess,
who, uh, one assumes,

427
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,539
turned all his thoughts
of revenge

428
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,999
to love and then
love to respect.

429
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,000
And yesterday,
a certain princess

430
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,842
may or may not have seen
much of your world

431
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,248
with a certain man,

432
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,336
and she certainly
might be eternally grateful.

433
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,842
Oh, this is vague stuff.
Vague stuff!

434
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,852
I did not think this through.

435
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,889
Moe, before I left,

436
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,886
I just wanted to give you
these examples

437
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,978
of our most beloved,
albeit depressing, literature.

438
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,185
Ah, some nice bedtime readin'.

439
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,646
Fun premise.

440
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,275
I'm laughing already.

441
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,323
Really not
cheerin' me up here,

442
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,407
but, uh, let me offer you
the only literature

443
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,042
in this bar--
sure works for me, though.

444
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,790
This coaster.

445
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,962
I will treasure it.

446
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,591
Well, I guess you'll pine forever

447
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,223
for a man who doesn't care,

448
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,890
while I just grow old
here in this bar.

449
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,429
Yeah.
Here's to suffering in silence.

450
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,691
Oh.

451
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,823
Mm. Can't wait to see those numbers
hanging from my rafters.

452
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,493
(sighs)
I can't believe it's been

453
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,321
three years since Smithers left.

454
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,326
Man, have I been aging badly.

455
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,788
But I guess I can finally
wash this forehead.

456
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,250
Oh, divine.

457
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,706
(doorbell ringing)

458
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,553
Oh, God, what do you want?

459
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,552
Well, neighbor, now that
your streak of rum luck

460
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,224
is at its end,
I have a favor to ask.

461
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,643
It involves charity.

462
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,888
I've set up
the Virgin Earth Challenge,

463
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,555
a $25 million prize

464
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,234
to eliminate
greenhouse gases,

465
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,812
that I was hoping
you would add to.

466
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,778
Where are the hounds
when I need them?

467
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:38,358
They're on a free Virgin Galactic flight
around the world.

468
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,655
Can you go five blasted minutes
without saying the word "virgin"?

469
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,080
That's another Virgin Challenge
that I will not be Virgin taking.

470
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,660
Virgin.

471
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,174
-(crowd murmuring)
-Shh!

472
