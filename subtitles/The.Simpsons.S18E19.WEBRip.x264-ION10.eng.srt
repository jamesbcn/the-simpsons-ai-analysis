BROCKMAN:
While our brave firemen
recuperate,

200
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,082
Springfield is a town
without a fire department,

201
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,540
which is bad news
for people like this man.

202
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,041
Sir, how does
it feel knowing

203
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,212
that no one is
coming to save you?

204
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,171
Oh, not as bad as knowing
that somewhere,

205
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,791
gays are marrying each other.

206
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,708
That’s the real
emergency, Kent.

207
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,546
Once again, crisis has
brought out the best in us.

208
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,643
I feel kind of
responsible.

209
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,598
Maybe I should volunteer
to be a fireman.

210
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,928

Count me in.

211
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,524
Just call me
Fireman Skinner.

212
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,480
You know, I think
I’ll volunteer, too.

213

say too?

with the fire extinguisher

-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah!

the volunteer fire department.

I’m, uh...

360
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,305
(chuckles)
I’m starting to wonder

361
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,897
if we’ve crossed a line here.

362
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,072
Just what are you
getting at?

363
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,741
Yeah, Hall Pass.

364
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,530
You better not be thinking
of ratting us out.

365
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,833
It would be a shame if the next
fire you fought was in hell!

366
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,578
Okay, okay.

367
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,330
I’ll just look the other way.

368
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,294

369
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,916
You guys sure aren’t
making this easy.

370

(fire alarm ringing)

371
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,006
Oh, thank God
there’s a fire.

372
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,426
Marge’s birthday’s
coming up.

373
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,104
I think what she would
treasure most

374
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,522
is a gift bought through

375
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,890

Next time Maggie
does that in a pool,

386
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,918
tell me quietly;
don’t announce it.

387
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,763
But, Mom, the lifeguards
have to know.

388
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,219
Just let the chemicals
deal with it.

Look at me! I’m a fireman!

Hey, Mom, can we go see
Dad put out the fire?

392
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:39,063
Well, I guess every boy
should see his father as a hero.

Hey, guys, check out
the radical-free air

my stolen Ionic Breeze.

he’s supposed to help?

HOMER:
Look at me, guys!

403
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,793
I’m stealing
five Segways at once!

404
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,877
And speaking of segues,

405
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,722
I’m off to my next
morally questionable activity!

406
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,379
(grumbles)

407
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,679
You’re nothing but a
diabolical master thief!

408
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,774
The kind that haunts
the slopes of Saint Moritz

409
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,769
or the casinos
of Monte Carlo!

410
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,401
We’re not thieves;
we’re scavengers,

411
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,109
like the beautiful vulture
or the heroic tapeworm,

412
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,820
or America’s sweetheart,
the maggot.

413

You should’ve seen
the faces of your children

414

415
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:38,239
Kids, get in here
and show your father the faces!
