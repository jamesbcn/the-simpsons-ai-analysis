{\an8}Am I ever.

00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:31,627
{\an8}<i>Then be the first family</i>

{\an8}<i>assembly fun blocks.</i>

17
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,559
{\an8}So, how much did you love Blockoland?

18
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,233
{\an8}It was all right, I guess.

19
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:47,068
{\an8}Kids... how would you like

20
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:50,318
{\an8}to go to... Blockoland?

21
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,531
{\an8}BOTH: Meh.

22
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,661
{\an8}But the TV gave me the impression that...

23
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,278
{\an8}We said, "meh."

24
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,905
{\an8}M-E-H. Meh. (loud slurp)

25
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,742
{\an8}Well, I'd like to go.

{\an8}Whee!

41
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,408
{\an8}OK, we have our choice of Rectangle Land

{\an8}Cube Country, or Squaresville.

43
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,078

{\an8}Take that! In the face!

52
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,772
{\an8}You knocked his block off.

53
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,475
{\an8}Come with me.

54
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,953
{\an8}Check it out.

55
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,070
{\an8}I built myself a healthy apple.

56
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,197
{\an8}But you made it out of ham cubes.

57
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,914
{\an8}Yep, a shiny new apple.

58
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,542
{\an8}I get it.

59
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,665
{\an8}Everything's made of blocks.

60
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,052
{\an8}Even the water.

61
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,381
{\an8}Hey. Ow.

62
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,465
{\an8}Hey, Boat 28, stop splashing.

63
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,010
{\an8}What are you going to do about it?

64
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,469

69
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:57,445
{\an8}Ow! Why did I get this Lego shirt?

70
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,744
{\an8}Don't you mean Blocko shirt?

71
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,332
{\an8}Right, right-- Blocko shirt.

72
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,544
{\an8}Lisa, how's your Eiffel Tower kit?

73
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,159
{\an8}It's OK, but it's missing a piece.

74
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,287
{\an8}Welcome to real life, Lisa.

75
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:13,464
{\an8}You can't fight City Hall,
a.k.a. Blockoland,

76
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,004
{\an8}so don't even try.

77
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,878
{\an8}What kind of a thing is that
to tell your children?

78
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,716
It's what I always tell them.

79
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,431
I told them that twice yesterday.

80
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,551
And then again as
they were going to sleep.

81
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:27,228
{\an8}[scoffs] I'm sure the gift shop
will replace the missing piece.

82
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,692
{\an8}You're right, honey.

83
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,138
Hear that, kids?

84
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,268
The Simpsons are going to Blockoland.

85
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,816
(all cheering)

86
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,780
HOMER: Excuse me.

87
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,946
You sold my little girl
a shoddy Eiffel Tower.

88
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,457
Hey, tough luck, pal.

89
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,329
You can't fight the souvenir industry.

90
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,376
We're too powerful.

91
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,128
{\an8}Yeah, you're right.

92
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,842
But before I go

93
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:02,013
I'm going to give you
a little souvenir of my own.

94
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,093
(grunting)

95
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,675
Aw, what the hey.

96
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,680
Here you go.

97
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,187
{\an8}Thank you, Dad.

98
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:15,059
{\an8}Hey, any friend of Marge
is a friend of mine.

99
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,282
So, how's that new block I got you?

100
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,319
Great.

101
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,904
Ah.

102
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,067
You know, standing up
for the little guy felt good.

103
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,527
I'm going to do it more often.

104
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,155
(gasp)

105
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,662
(impact grunts)

106
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,825
(grunting)

107
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,172
-(tires screeching, engine revving)
-(Marge grunting)

108
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,794
-WIGGUM: Scram!
-LOU: (screams)

109
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,166
Those bullies are gone now.

110
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,382
You idiot.

111
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,342
They were beating out
my shirt fire. (grunts)

112
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,013
My heart was in the right place, jerk.

113
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,554
Hyah!

114
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,721
Thanks again, Dad.

115
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,927
Well, you're welcome, honey.

116
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,098
Now I'm going to spend the whole day

117
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,057
helping shmoes with their problems.

118
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,477
You got a problem, Bart?

119
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:00,025
A girl at school won't go
to the dance with me.

120
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,819
<i>♪ Bart's got a girlfriend ♪</i>

121
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,863
{\an8}No I don't, that's the problem.

122
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,405
<i>♪ Bart's got a problem. ♪</i>

123
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,951
Don't worry, son.

124
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,084
I'll handle this.

125
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:15,786
Come on.

126
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,535
Why won't you go out with Bart?

127
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,457
He's a smelly, ugly dork.

128
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:24,006
Please. Ugly is such a smelly word.

129
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,762
Who would you rather go out with?

130
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,053
Tommy.

131
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,773
Well, duh.

132
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,098
He's breathtaking

133
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,313
but Bart has inner beauty

134
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,854
like you'd find in a rodent.

135
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,527
And face it, you're no prize, either.

136
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,029
You wear braces, you dress like a kid

137
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,492
and you're not getting any younger.

138
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,031
Take what you can get.

139
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,945
He's right. Grab something,
and don't let go.

140
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,247
Well, Bart's not <i>so </i>bad.

141
00:06:56,249 --> 00:07:00,129
Uh, they wouldn't honor
my coupon for two free streaks.

142
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,461
They wouldn't?

143
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,296
Well, I'll go to bat for you, honey.

144
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,300
{\an8}Yes, may I help you?

145
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,097
{\an8}Nice place you got here.

146
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,600
{\an8}Oh, look, a hair net.

147
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:17,482
{\an8}Be a shame if it was hurled to the ground.

148
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,692
(grunts)

149
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:23,154
Oh, how clumsy of me.

150
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,244
And...

151
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,696
Oops.

152
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,609
Why are you doing these things?

153
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,318
Either you honor my wife's coupon

154
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,238
or a lot more lids will be unscrewed.

155
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,036
But I cannot streak that much hair.

156
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,001
Think of the cost.

157
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,040
I'd be ruined.

158
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,503
Oh, really.

159
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,419
Boy, you weren't kidding.

160
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,922
Your profit margins are razor-thin.

161
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,295
You see? This is what I'm...

162
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,801
Wait a minute.

163
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,763
$400 a month for loafer lightener?

164
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,354
But we must have it.

165
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,259
It is the lifeblood of the industry.

166
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,685
You get the same results
with a mincing gel.

167
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,518
But of course!

168
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,975
I will save thousands. Thank you.

169
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,444
Oh, Homie, I love them.

170
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,146
I can't thank you enough.

171
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,906
The satisfaction of helping
another human being

172
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,329
is all the thanks I et cetera.

173
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,156
And I gave that man directions

174
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,826
even though I didn't know the way

175
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,455
'cause that's the kind of guy
I am this week.

176
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,087
Ah, lousy Isotopes.

177
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,934
They're a disgrace to baseball.

178
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:30,889
They lost again?

179
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:31,798
Mm-hmm.

180
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,676
The team's been terrible
since they got bought

181
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,563
by that cheap, heartless Duff Corporation.

182
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,271
Hey, Moe, give me a Duff.

183
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,363
Oh, yeah, sweet Duff.

184
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,569
What a minute. Duff owns
the Springfield Isotopes?

185
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,571
Since when?

186
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,612
They bought them a year ago
from the Mafia.

187
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,855
It was the last of the family-owned teams.

188
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,658
I tried to return my season ticket

189
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,371
but they wouldn't give me my money back.

190
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,951
They said they wanted it.

191
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,406
Say no more.

192
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,656
I'll help you, Lenny.

193
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,957
You want to help me?

194
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,080
Oh, haven't you heard?

195
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,076
He's the new Homer.

196
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,877
He's wonderful.

197
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,091
I'm trying to get a refund
for this ticket.

198
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,387
Is this the executive office
of the ball club?

199
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,061
Nope. This is the equipment shed.

200
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,219
Oh. Well, is that it?

201
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,939
That's where we keep the water heater.

202
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,809
-Is...
-That's a tractor.

203
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,226
I see.

204
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,153
MAN: Sir, we can't give your friend

205
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,073
a refund just because the team is losing.

206
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,662
I'm sorry to hear that.

207
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,824
Spin that back to where it was.

208
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,737
Yes, sir.

209
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,704
This meeting is over.

210
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:38,735
OK.

211
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,785
So, uh, you want to go
get something to eat?

212
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,422
No, I don't.

213
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,458
Get out of here.

214
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,673
No, no, not that door.

215
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,922
(gasps)

216
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,966
"Albuquerque Isotopes?"

217
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,602
What is all this stuff?

218
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,353
It's not anything.

219
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,521
It has no purpose.

220
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,808
What a crazy room.

221
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,564
There's no Albuquerque Isotopes.

222
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,516
It's the Springfield... Oh.

223
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,978
No, no, there's no "oh."

224
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:13,027
You're moving the team
to Albuquerque, aren't you?

225
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,362
No, no, we would never abandon

226
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,528
our loyal Springfield fans.

227
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,487
By the way, all this barging
into rooms marked "Private"

228
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,368
must have made you thirsty.

229
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,455
-Would you like a beer?
-Well, OK.

230
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,500
But you can't silence Homer Simpson.

231
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,344
I'm the friend of the downtrodden

232
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,799
and I'm not going to forget
what I saw here today.

233
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,210
Of course not.

234
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,928
-(buzzing)
-Duffman, could you bring in two bottles

235
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,429
of smooth, untainted Duff?

236
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,061
DUFFMAN: <i>Oh, yeah!</i>

237
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,888
(Baritone voice) <i>♪ Oh, yeah! ♪</i>

238
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,394
Now, Homer, we've developed this additive

239
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,557
that makes beer super, super malty.

240
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,557
Care to try it?

241
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,478
Wait a minute.

242
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,025
{\an8}Will this erase my memory?

243
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,188
No, not at all.

244
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,793
Man, that is malty.

245
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,410
But he'll never know.

246
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,405
(evil laughter)

247
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:13,633
-Good grief.
-(whining) Ow, my head!

248
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,264
How long have I been out here?

249
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,181
All night. You were yelling at the swing.

250
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,389
I was?

251
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,304
But I love the swing.

252
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,008
Dad, you were nuts.

253
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,268
You know me, occasionally I'll be quirky.

254
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,520
I'll-be-quirky...

255
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:28,975
Albuquerque!

256
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,313
I'll be right back.

257
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,730
<i>Members of the media</i>

258
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:34,858
thank you for coming.

259
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,454
The proof that the Isotopes
are moving to Albuquerque

260
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,820
is right behind this door.

261
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:40,827
MAN: Excuse me.

262
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,238
Joel Duffman, the <i>Newsly Times.</i>

263
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,867
What's with the smear campaign

264
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,874
against this beloved brewer?

265
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,997
And weren't you once in a loony bin?

266
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,705
Oh, yeah!

267
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,955
He's right, folks.

268
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:58,046
The only story here is the rich,
smooth taste of Duff.

269
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,184
Yes, that is an important story.

270
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,851
But so is this!

271
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,223
(trumpet playing)

272
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,887
Well, I think I know tomorrow's headline,

273
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,597
"Local Man Is Liar."

274
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,807
That is a good headline.

275
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,738
BROCKMAN: <i>So let me get this</i>
<i>straight, Mr. Duff,</i>

276
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,409
<i>the Isotopes are not</i>
<i>moving to Albuquerque?</i>

277
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,698
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

278
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,911
<i>So, are you calling Homer Simpson a liar?</i>

279
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,123
<i>Well, we have obtained this footage of him</i>

280
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,833
<i>with his pants on fire.</i>

281
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,583
{\an8}(screaming) Oh, no!

282
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,126
Well, Homie, I believe
you're telling the truth

283
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,670
about the Isotopes.

284
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,384
I don't mind being called a liar

285
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,724
when I'm lying, or about to lie

286
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,259
or just finished lying.

287
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:44,676
But not when I'm telling the truth!

288
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,354
Yeah, but what can you do?

289
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,482
There's all kinds of ways
to get the public on your side.

290
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,150
Bob Dylan wrote songs.

291
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,648
Cesar Chavez staged hunger strikes.

292
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,691
That's it.

293
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,784
I'll go on a hunger strike.

294
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,399
Oh, Homie, you couldn't
keep up a hunger strike.

295
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,278
You eat while you brush your teeth.

296
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,454
You're eating a huge sausage right now.

297
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,489
So?

298
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,197
I can stop.

299
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,327
And I will stop.

300
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:13,832
I am on a hunger strike
starting right... now.

301
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,835
(whimpering)

302
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,255
Mmm! Mmm!

303
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,596
(sucking noises)

304
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,443
Let's see those double-A
baseball honchos ignore this.

305
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,486
You're really not going to eat anything?

306
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,569
My hunger strike will not end

307
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,905
until Duff admits they're moving the team.

308
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,280
Bart, my chains.

309
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,122
Mm-mmm.

310
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,503
Mm. Mm.

311
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,163
Now it begins.

312
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,578
Dad, I'm so proud of you.

313
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,326
{\an8}If you need some inspiration

314
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,047
{\an8}here's a book of
Mike Farrell's core beliefs.

315
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,224
(mumbling)

316
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,048
Man, he really hates Wayne Rogers.

317
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,969
Goodbye, Homie.

318
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,724
Here's Dr. Hibbert's number
if you feel weak.

319
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:13,807
Don't worry, Duff's not going to
let me waste away to nothing.

320
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,194
Uh, Dad...

321
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,523
D'oh...

322
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,859
What a great ball game.

323
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,574
Thanks, Weekend Dad.

324
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,074
Stop calling me that.

325
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,195
Hey, kid and man!

326
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,952
Don't support a team run by liars!

327
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:29,954
Liars?

328
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,495
They're secretly planning

329
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,499
to move to Albuquerque.

330
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,710
That's crazy!

331
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,579
It would've been on a talk radio show

332
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,166
like <i>Sports Chat </i>or <i>Sportszilla</i>
<i>and the Jabber Jocks.</i>

333
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,343
-Yeah!
-Why you little... (yells)

334
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,682
Oh, so hungry...

335
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,219
Can't give up...

336
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,764
must continue fighting evil corporation...

337
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,690
Oh, Seymour, you shouldn't have!

338
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,609
It's going to go straight to my thighs.

339
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,018
Well, Edna, it just
might have some company.

340
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,607
Oh... Seymour!

341
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,197
(startled grunt)

342
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,450
Nice try, God.

343
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,079
But Homer Simpson doesn't give in

344
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,540
to temptation that easily... hey!

345
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,041
(slurping)

346
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,502
Stop that!

347
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,132
(all eating)

348
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:21,918
(sighs)

349
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,764
There's still more meatloaf.

350
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,879
Oh, that's impossible.

351
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,136
Come on, come on, we all have to pitch in

352
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,428
and eat your father's share.

353
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,011
Uh, why don't you just cook less?

354
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,217

Geez, Homer's losing it already.

360
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,489
Yeah, but his weary shuffling

361
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,825
makes my heart smile.

362
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,040
(moans)

363
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,874
I'm <i>so </i>hungry.

364
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:58,957
(rumbling)

365
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,171
{\an8}His tummy sounds angry, Daddy.

366
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,671
Yeah, that's his stomach eating itself.

367
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,375
It's such a beautiful day.

368
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,755
Where are the crowds?

369
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,391
Duffman is thrusting

370
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,138
in the direction of the problem.

371
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:17,692
Hmm, people seem to be drawn to that kook.

372
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,688
Maybe we can exploit him.

373
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,940
It's too dangerous, sir.

374
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,311
He knows about Albuquerque.

375
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,528
Duffman is a cautious cat.

376
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,318
No, listen, fans love wackos.

377
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,903
Remember that busty woman

378
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,028
who ran out on the field
and farted at the ballplayers?

379
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,334
I think we've found our newest attraction.

380
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,501
Duffman has a bad feeling about this.

381
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,750
Can it, Sid.

382
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,422
(normal voice)
Why don't you can it, Howard?

383
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,342
(snoring)

384
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,020
Uh? Wha...? What's going on?

385
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,428
What am I doing here?

386
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,426
Order of Mr. Duff.

387
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,517
And word to the wise,

388
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,891
If someone hits a home run

389
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,938
the fireworks come out here and here.

390
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:03,862
(bat cracks)

391
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:04,769
(crowd cheering)

392
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,857
Got to go!

393
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,784
(organ fanfare plays)

394
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,032
ANNOUNCER (over PA):
Folks, it's time to meet

395
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,953
a real super-fan

396
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,832
Hungry Hungry Homer.

397
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,079
He's on a hunger strike

398
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,831
till the 'Topes win the pennant!

399
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,583
(cheering)

400
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,915
What? That's not why I'm here!

401
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,301
{\an8}(distant) They're moving the team
to Albuquerque!

402
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,799
Hear that, folks?

403
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,181
He said, "Go, 'Topes!"

404
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,798
(cheering)

405
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,715
Oh, all this hunger for nothing.

406
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,764
Get your hot dogs!

407
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,177
Fat, juicy hot dogs!

408
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,095
Pork chops and apple sauce!

409
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,144
Peking duck!

410
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,436
Get your crispy Peking duck!

411
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,860
Yeah, Duck Man, over here!

412
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,318
(sizzles)

413
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,898
Mmm!

414
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:48,903
(smacking)

415
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,194
Mmm!

416
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:51,989
(smacking and slurping)

417
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,410
Do they have to chew so loud?

418
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,946
Oh... I'm wasting away...

419
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,541
Oh, I'm down to a B-cup.

420
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,829
It's been a whole week!

421
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,748
Why are you letting my husband die?

422
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,916
What does that have to do with baseball?

423
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,715
Death is a part of baseball.

424
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,799
Oh, yeah, the main part.

425
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,303
Guys...

426
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,434
Uh, we won't let any harm come
to your husband, Mrs. Simpson.

427
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,513
He'll be fine.

428
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,097
He's not moving.

429
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,772
(flies buzzing)

430
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,140
He's probably resting

431
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,557
from all the moving he did
before you got here.

432
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,316
He'll start moving in
a second, I'm sure of it.

433
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,938
Turn on the sprinklers.

434
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:33,145
(slow groaning)

435
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,317
You see there? He's fine.

436
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,615
Oh, look at him go!

437
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,948
(growls)

438
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,115
Oh, I'm so hungry.

439
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,826
Oh, why keep starving myself?

440
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,205
No one cares.

441
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:50,131
Mm? (moan)

442
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,915
-Who are you?
-The spirit of Cesar Chavez.

443
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,967
Why do you look like Cesar Romero?

444
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,181
Because you don't know
what Cesar Chavez looks like.

445
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,432
Why are you here?

446
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,473
To tell you not to give up.

447
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,137
Oh, but I want to...

448
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,935
He's talking to himself, sir.

449
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,348
And his smell is distracting
the center fielder.

450
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,231
Yeah, this is getting sad.

451
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,355
Let's bring him in.

452
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,651
(snoring)

453
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,034
OK, Skinny, on your feet.

454
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,282
What's happening?

455
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,243
Did I crush your corporation?

456
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,913
No, you're being replaced.

457
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,042
-(moans)
-(crowd booing)

458
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,580
And now, taking over
for Hungry Hungry Homer...

459
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:30,375
let's welcome Paint-Drinking Pete!

460
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,964
(gulping)

461
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,716
(crowd cheering)

462
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,930
(Homer groaning)

463
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,974
Well, Homer, your hunger strike lasted

464
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,135
12 amazing days.

465
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,444
{\an8}(weakly) Oh, me so hungee.

466
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,268
Of course you are, Hungry Hungry Homer.

467
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,774
So why not break your fast
with our brand-new

468
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,187
Isotope Dog Supreme?

469
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,856
(sniffs) (shuddering)

470
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,534
Oh, so hard to resist...

471
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,454
mesquite-grilled onions...

472
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,583
jalapeno relish...

473
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,543
Wait a minute, those are
Southwestern ingredients!

474
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,213
(puzzled murmurs)

475
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,131
Mango-lime salsa?

476
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,514
That's the kind of bold flavor
they enjoy in...

477
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,129
Albuquerque!

478
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,046
(all gasping)

479
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,343
He's right!

480
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,756
Yeah, and the wrapper says

481
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,684
"Albuquerque Isotopes"!

482
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,013
Homer was right!

483
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,307
They're planning to move the team!

484
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,271
(angry clamoring)

485
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,269
Now, now, now, now, see here, people

486
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,614
let's not be too hasty.

487
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,518
Tell the truth! Come on, everybody...

488
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,317
(chanting) Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

489
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,031
Get him out of here.

490
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,911
Don't listen to him, Duffman.

491
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:43,028
For once in your life,
stand up for the little guy!

492
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,794
New feelings brewing in Duffman.

493
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,285
What... would Jesus do?

494
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:51,712
(surprised grunt)

495
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,251
(yelling)

496
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,457
(all cheering)

497
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,967
Oh, yeah!

498
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,929
(cheering)

499
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,099
(chanting) Eat! Eat! Eat!

500
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,564
(gulps) (sighs)

501
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,191
The truth never tasted so good.

502
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,099
(cheering)

503
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,727
Way to go, Slim!

504
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,024
(gulping)

505
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,529
Damn, that town's got too much spirit.

506
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,445
{\an8}Looks like we'll have to steal
some other baseball team.

507
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,445
{\an8}See what Dallas wants for the Cowboys.

508
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,577
{\an8}Uh, that's a football team, sir.

509
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,004
{\an8}They'll play what I tell them to play...

510
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,747
for I am the Mayor of Albuquerque.

511
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,096
(closing theme music)

512
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,590
Shh!
