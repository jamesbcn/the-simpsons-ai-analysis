00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,730
<i>(bowling pins clatter)</i>

349
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,738
What?

350
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:22,739
What is it?

351
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,070
What are you doing?

352
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,914
Looking at you with quiet awe.

353
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,240
Well, as long as it's quiet.

354
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,877
<i>Milhouse to Bart.</i>
<i>Milhouse to Bart.</i>

355
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,132
<i>Please don't hate me.</i>

356
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,974
<i>Please?</i>

357
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,232
HOMER:
Ooh, right next to the boss.

358
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,019
(loud bump)

359
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,023
Aw, he'll never know who did it.

360
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,610
(Smithers grumbling)

361
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,653
(Smithers muttering)

362
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,947
(Smithers groaning)

363
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,409
Ah, Simpson, there's someone

364
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,991
I want you to meet--
Aristotle Ametdopolous,

365
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,907
owner of the Shelbyville
Nuclear Power Facility.

366
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,330
Huh? What?

367
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,497
It seems Ari's been having terrible
worker problems at Shelbyville.

368
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,246
They've lost their zest
for work.

369
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,008
You must help them find their
eanae-eharatou-nah-duleve.

370
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,970
-Their eanae haratou doolawhat?
-Yes.

371
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,261
We want you to give them
a pep talk that turns them from

372
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,215
a bunch of
donut-eating goof-offs

373
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,765
into a pack of
Homer Simpsons.

374
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,479
I really can't
tell them anything.

375
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,979
Oh, cut the false modesty!
It's getting tiresome.

376
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,572
Besides, it's your duty. Employee of
the month isn't all ham and plaques.

377
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,069
(Smithers panting)

378
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,401
Well, Smithers.

379
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,446
How kind of you
to pay us a visit.

380
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,199
Couldn't help it, sir.
The parking here is terrible.

381
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,792
-(gasping)
-This man has no love

382
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:53,908
for his power plant.

383
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,454
Be gone from my sight.

384
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,001
That one's
always been a problem.

385
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,510
One, two, three.
Community chest.

386
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,048
Nah.

387
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,841
Nah. Ah!

388
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,085
I've won second prize
in a beauty contest.

389
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,257
Collect ten bucks.

390
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:15,095
Ha, ha! You're losing.

391
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:18,022
Bart, don't feed
your sister hotels.

392
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,102
Don't worry, Mom.
There's tons of these things.

393
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,147
I think that game
is too old for her.

394
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,771
Why don't you go
play with Milhouse?

395
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,397
I don't want to
play with Milhouse.

396
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,114
You mean you still haven't
made up with him?

397
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,664
It's his mom. She says
I'm a bad influence.

398
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,278
C'mon Maggie, let's go throw rocks
at that hornets' nest.

399
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,156
(grumbles)

400
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,833
(bell chimes)

401
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,212
Mrs. Van Houten,
I'm Bart's mother.

402
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,829
We met in the emergency room
when the boys drank paint.

403
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,667
I remember.
Please come in.

404
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,632
Marge, I'm sorry

405
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,263
but I think it would be better

406
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,919
if Milhouse didn't see
your son.

407
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,588
Look, I know Bart
can be a handful,

408
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,967
but I also know
what he's like inside.

409
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,845
He's got a spark.

410
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,482
It's not a bad thing.

411
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,809
Of course,
it makes him do bad things.

412
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,064
Well, Marge, the other day

413
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,767
Milhouse told me
my meat loaf sucks.

414
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,398
He must have gotten that
from your little boy,

415
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,025
because they certainly
don't say that word on TV.

416
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,993
Well, I can't defend
everything he does,

417
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,494
but let's face it.

418
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,486
All Bart and Milhouse have
is each other.

419
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,458
They're too young for girls,

420
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,708
and they're a popular target
for bullies,

421
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,960
and in the Christmas pageant,
they're always sheep.

422
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,884
Please, please,
let them be friends.

423
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,176
(sighing)
I'll think about it, Marge.

424
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,771
So the next time
somebody tells you

425
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,980
carny folk are good,
honest people,

426
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,611
you can spit
in their faces for me.

427
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,978
I will, Mr. Gumble.
But if you'll excuse me,

428
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,776
I'm profiling my dad
for the school paper.

429
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,700
I thought it'd be neat
to follow him around for a day

430
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,239
-to see what makes him tick.
-Aw, that's sweet.

431
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,913
I used to follow my dad to
a lot of bars too. (belches)

432
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,873
MOE: Here you go.
One beer, one chocolate milk.

433
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,373
Excuse me,
I have the chocolate milk.

434
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,536
Oh.

435
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,834
(groans)

436
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,167
What's the matter, Homer?

437
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,751
The depressing effects
of alcohol

438
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,756
usually don't kick in
till closing time.

439
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:10,918
He's just
a little nervous.

440
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,506
He has to give
a speech tomorrow

441
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,801
on how to
keep cool in a crisis.

442
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,175
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

443
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,601
BARNEY: Hey, I had to
give a speech once.

444
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,139
I was pretty nervous,
so I used a little trick.

445
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,394
I pictured everyone
in their underwear--

446
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,857
the judge, the jury, my lawyer--
everybody.

447
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,399
-Did it work?
-I'm a free man, ain't I?

448
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,783
<i>Milhouse to Bart.</i>
<i>Do you want to come over and play?</i>

449
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,161
Really?
We can be friends again?

450
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,869
Did your mom die?

451
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,449
<i>Uh, I don't think so.</i>

452
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,794
Well, who cares?

453
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,198
<i>Milhouse, I'll be right there.</i>

454
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,446
Sorry, Maggie.
Game's over.

455
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,211
Hey, Mom! I'm friends
with Milhouse again.

456
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,382
Well I knew his mother
would come to her senses.

457
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,712
Thanks for sticking up
for me.

458
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,968
What makes you think
I did it?

459
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,089
Who else would?

460
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,799
Aw...

461
00:18:58,887 --> 00:18:59,887
You be good.

462
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,062
I will.

463
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,015
(gun cocking)

464
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,065
As I look out into this sea
of smiling faces,

465
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,280
I am filled with a sense
of loathing and revulsion.

466
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,661
You are not workers.

467
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,868
You are a pack of mangy,
cud-chewing, ugly goats.

468
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,950
Well, you're in for a treat.

469
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,865
We have with us today
a real man.

470
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,504
Behold the glory
that is Homer Simpson.

471
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,582
(cheers)

472
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:30,963
(clears throat)

473
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:34,634
Uh... "Ladies and...

474
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,755
gentlemen."

475
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,809
<i>Just picture them</i>
<i>in their underwear...</i>

476
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,845
Whew!

477
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,725
Ahh!

478
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:53,232
(voice cracking)
"Grace under pressure is no..."

479
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,857
<i>Three minutes to meltdown.</i>

480
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,034
(screaming)

481
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,780
Whew! Saved by the bell.

482
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,696
<i>Fifteen seconds</i>
<i>to core meltdown.</i>

483
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,785
Just do what you did before.

484
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,871
All right.

485
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,916
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

486
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,052
catch a tiger by the toe,

487
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,759
if he hollers let him go,

488
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,929
eeny, meeny, miny moe.

489
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,349
<i>Crisis has been averted.</i>

490
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,848
<i>Everything is super.</i>

491
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,768
Thank you, Homer,
for saving my plant

492
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,561
with that idiotic rhyming!

493
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,265
Do you even know
what button you pushed?

494
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,356
Sure-- Moe.

495
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,111
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

496
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,953
Is Homer a hero?

497
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,778
The answer is no.

498
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:43,283
I'm Kent Brockman
and that was "My Two Cents."

499
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,787
Now, back to Scott Christian
with "Laugh and a Half."

500
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,289
Thanks, Kent.

501
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,371
There was more dumb luck
in the news today

502
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,916
when our own police chief
Wiggum foiled a bank holdup

503
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,500
without even trying.

504
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,745
<i>It seems the chief</i>
<i>had gone to the bank</i>

505
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,757
<i>to cash in his penny jar.</i>

506
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,129
<i>...48, 49, 50.</i>

507
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,177
<i>-What the--</i>
<i>-Ooh!</i>

508
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,301
<i>Good work, Chief.</i>

509
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,137
<i>Just doing my job.</i>

510
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:09,232
Yes, it seems the chief pulled
a Homer Simpson of his own.

511
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,519
(men laughing)

512
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,063
Whoa!

513
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,726
Huh?

514
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,226
A pretzel?

515
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:20,607
Wow! Looks like
I pulled a Homer.

516
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,526
CHICK HEARN:
<i>The Lakers have the ball.</i>

517
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,374
<i>Magic Johnson coming down</i>
<i>the floor on a fast break.</i>

518
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,159
<i>Magic stops. His feet</i>
<i>slip out from under him!</i>

519
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,794
<i>The ball flies out of his hands,</i>
<i>hits the referee in the head</i>

520
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,330
<i>goes in the basket!</i>

521
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,754
