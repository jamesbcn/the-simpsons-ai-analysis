28
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,713
{\an8}I’d like to declare
bankruptcy, please.

29
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:32,177
{\an8}Mr. Simpson, do you understand
how bankruptcy works?

30
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,178
{\an8}Yes I do. Under Chapter 13
of the fiscal code,

31
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,261
{\an8}an individual whose debts
exceed his assets

32
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:41,347
{\an8}may file for bankruptcy,
thus protecting said assets.

33
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,354
{\an8}-That was the old
bankruptcy law.
-Huh?

34
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,857
{\an8}Under the new law, you have to
pay your creditors everything.

35
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,821
{\an8}What the...? But I thought
bankruptcy was the cool law!

36
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:54,662
{\an8}The one that says "Dude, don’t
worry about it. I got this."

37
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,449
{\an8}Mr. Simpson, I’m afraid
this court must appoint

38
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,874
{\an8}a financial officer to supervise
repayment of your debts.

39
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,044
Hmm...

40
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,162

41
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,168

to watch Grandpa
watch the kids.

116
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,808
For some reason,
she doesn’t trust him.

117
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,103
Maybe it’s the bang-up job
he did raising you.

118
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,017
He was a great Dad.

119
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,566
Every year he got
so mad

bring me presents.

with so much to offer

127
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,978
is alone on a Saturday night.

Wow, that’s the first time
anyone’s ever

put an adjective
before calling me a thing.

where, but I got my theories.

00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,493
Oh, why did I borrow
that roof from him?

161
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:30,871
So exactly what company am I
giving these free boxes to?

162

of the company is...

00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,186
That might work, too.

176
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,402
I’m glad you called.

177
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,533
This is really going
to drive Homer crazy.

178
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,110
Well, actually,

179
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,945
the real reason I asked you
out is because I’m...

180
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,991
well, I’m a little sweet
on you.

181
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:15,954
Oh, listen, Abe,
the other night was fun, but...

182
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,497
Ah, phooey on buts.

183
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,580
At my age,
and with your drawbacks,

184
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,745
we can’t afford
to miss an opportunity.

185
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,344
Why don’t we just spend
some time together

186
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,800
and see where that takes us?

187
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,842
Yeah, what the hell?

188
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,506
Want to split a basket
of garlic bread?

189
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,804
Slow down, you hussy.

190
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:38,518
<i>♪ Is she really going out</i>
<i>with him? ♪</i>

191
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:42,521
<i>♪ Is she really gonna</i>

192
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,935

193
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:50,946

194
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,990

195
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,575

196
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:00,081

197
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,834
Oh, look at Grampa and Selma
frolicking in the water.

198
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,288
It’s not right.

199
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,508
It’s like an old sea
turtle dating a suitcase

200
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,048
that fell out
of a plane.

201
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,801
Be nice, Homer.

202
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,933
Don’t you see how great it is
that they found each other?

203
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,061
Like how the parts
of a pig nobody wants combine

204
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,099
to make a yummy hot dog.

205
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,563
Oh, now you’re dragging
hot dogs into this.

206
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,064
Real classy, Marge.

207
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,805
Real classy.

208
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,527
Hey, Homer, that garbage
barge is complaining

209
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,938
about your smell.

210
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,526
We wrote that
joke in the water.

211
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,031
It wasn’t all
frolicking.

212
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,033
(both laughing)

213
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,487
(groans)

214
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,697
How could my Dad
go out with Selma?

215
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,867
Don’t those two gargoyles
know that love

216
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,456
is for good-looking
young people?

217
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,081
Well, gee,
Homer, you, uh,

218
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,627
ain’t exactly open-
casket material yourself.

219
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,802
(gasping):
Words hurt, you know.

220
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,920
(sobbing)

221
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,878
They do.

222
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,178
Stupid Selma and Grampa.

223
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,273
How dare they find happiness.

224
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,388
Psst! Over here.

225
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,434
It’s me. Patty.

226
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,477
Oh, great.

227
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,730
Who are you
in love with?

228
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,061
Bart?

229
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,056
Look, if you want to break up
your Father and Selma,

230
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,358
I have a plan.

231
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,731
But it involves you.

232
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,857
Okay, but I’m not
good at details.

233
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:12,864
Or the big picture.

234
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:13,895
I also show up late.

235
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,568
And drunk.

236
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,826
(whispering loudly):
I’ve got a good
feeling about this.

237
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,701
Lower the drawbridge!

238
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,287
What’s the password?

239
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,133
I love my sister.

240
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,458
(laughs)

241
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,420
Hey, you
little brats.

242
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:36,217
Get down from
those battlements!

243
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,802
Those boxes are
for shipping,

244
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,507
not for creating a world
of pure imagination.

245
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,138
Give them back.

246
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,694
Not till we’re bored
with them. Now, begone!

247
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,229
(British accent):
I shall go,

248
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,652
but I will return with
an army of my brethren

249
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,362
and together we shall
take back what is ours

250
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,453
and Hell will rain
down upon you!

251
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:56,819
What if we’re not here?

252
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,156
We will come two more times,

253
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:05,122
and then <i>you’ll </i>have to come
to <i>our </i>customer center.

254
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,456
(regular voice):
It’s near the airport

255
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,130
where the old Crown
Books used to be.

256
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,548
(humming)

257
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,842
Hello, Homer.

258
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:16,925
(shrieks):
Selma!

259
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,259
Relax, it’s just me, Patty.

260
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,345
(shrieks):
Patty!

261
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,099
Do you have your disguise?

262
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:27,232
Hola, I am Esteban
de la Sexface.

263
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,021
That means "Stephen
of the Sexface."

264
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,065
Okay, now let’s prepare
our mental images

265
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,438
so we can kiss each
other without barfing.

266
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,714
(moaning)

267
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,964
Whoa-oa-oa!

268
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,505
(joyfully scatting)

269
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,879
-Mm! Yes!
-(both moaning)

270
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,176
Oh, baby.

271
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,549
(gasps):
What the...?

272
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,755
Selma, how could you?!

273
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,926
Sorry, Abe,
we’re through.

274
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:07,644
I thought
we really had something.

275
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,267
What the hell
is going on here?

276
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,814
<i>Dos </i>Selmas?

277
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,477
Ay-yi-yi!

278
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,818
(gasps):
Homer!

279
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,034
Why would you try
to break us up?

280
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,985
I guess I always dreamed

281
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,445
that my father would
grow old alone.

282
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,366
Well, nerts
to both of ya!

283
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,825
Our love is so strong

284
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,214
not even a thousand crazy
schemes could tear it apart!

285
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,093
A thousand, eh?

286
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,050
I love this woman

287
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,220
and I’m gonna make sure
she’s in my life forever.

288
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,179
-I’m Patty.
-Nice to meet you.

289
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,719
Selma, will you marry me?

290
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:43,803
Abe...

291
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,558
I... uh...

292
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,810
Yes!

293
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,732
Homer, say hello
to your new ma!

294
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,521
(both laugh)

295
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:58,283
(screaming):
No!

296
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,990
("Wedding March" plays)

297
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,360
(all cheering)

298
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,076
Dad, don’t throw rice,
it makes the birds swell up!

299
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,911
Oh, Lisa, that’s one of those
rumors you get off the Internet.

300
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:17,214
Hey, Selma, want some rice?

301
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,416
(Grampa and Selma laughing)

302
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,627
(horn honking)

303
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,676
-(tires screeching)
-Pick a lane, freaks!

304
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,971
Nothing solves
everything forever

305
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,135
like a wedding.

306
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,142
Now to do something

307
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:35,107
I’ve been looking forward to
my whole wedding day.

308
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,529
(sighs):
Oh!

309
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,899
I’m glad I waited.

310
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,105
Now that we’re married,
I want to tell you

311
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,736
I have one strict policy--

312
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,243
no wife of mine
ever has to work.

313
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,655
Are you sure, Abe?

314
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,043
They offered me a
promotion at the D.M.V.

315
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,040
It’s longer hours, but we can
afford a place of our own.

316
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,543
Nonsense!

317
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,205
When I left Pan Am, they said

318
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,093
they’d always have
a job waiting for me.

319
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,510
Abe, there’s no more Pan Am.

320
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,589
Oh, I’m an old fool.

321
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,845
I don’t even have two
kidneys to rub together.

322
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,598
Oh, don’t worry, Abe.

323
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,770
I can provide
for both of us.

324
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,179
Now, we <i>are </i>on
our honeymoon.

325
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,398
I thought we were
at the circus, Lisa.

326
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,108
Oh, boy.

327
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,743
Sorry I was at
work so late.

328
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:25,662
How’d it go
with the baby?

329
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,199
We’re having
a great time.

330
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,663
I cleaned up all my best
war stories for her.

331
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,503
I told her how
we chased the teddy bears

332
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,870
into their cuddle-bunkers,

333
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,917
then had to tickle them out

334
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,751
with machine-hugs
and fun-throwers.

335
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,417
They say the more soldiers
you tickle,

336
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,376
the easier it gets.

337
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,926
Well, sir, it doesn’t.

338
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,936
Who knew guys in brown shirts
could cause so much trouble?

339
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,995
(whispers):
It begins.

340
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,587
For the Brown Empire!

341
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,342
(yelling)

342
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,385
(shouting)

343
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,892
(groaning, grunting)

344
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,651
(grunting)

345
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,750
(yelling)

346
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,212
(dragon shrieking)

347
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,588
Nelson, you came to help
in our hour of need.

348
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,927
(metallic sword ringing)

349
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,761
(battle cry):
Ha-ha!

350
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,767
(metallic clanging)

351
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,490
(shrieking)

352
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,741
(objects whistling)

353
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,289
(whistling sounds)

354
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,041
(yelling, shouting)

355
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,171
Yeah! We did it!

356
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:53,138
Now we can enjoy
Boxingham Palace in peace!

357
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,850
Want to melt it
with a hose?

358
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,061
Sure, I guess.

359
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,391
A couple of birds
pooped on it over here.

360
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,034
-Selma...
-Walk with me.

361
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,286
The new traffic
cones are held
up in Harrisburg.

362
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,368
Go to the costume store.

363
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,213
Get a hundred wizard hats
and a bucket of orange paint.

364
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,209
I love that!

365
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,420
We’ve lost the answer key
for written test number seven!

366
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,050
A-C-D-A-A-C-B-B-C-A!

367
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,418
You are what I want to be.

368
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,085
Selma, the
divider broke,

369
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,884
and the driver’s
test line is mixing

370
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,047
with the license
renewal line!

371
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,255
Hey, re-newbies,
stay on your side!

372
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,176
You and what line divider
is going to make me?

373
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,476
(sighs):
Oh!

374
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,769
I shaved my legs
to the knees for this?

375
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,611
Now to relax
with a nice cup of tea.

376
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,994
(laughing)

377
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,122
Which one of you do-hickeys
is the tea kettle?

378
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,882
Oh, a flapjack flipper.

379
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,893
I usually don’t cook,

380
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,888
but when you’re in love,
you do crazy things!

381
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,271
Now I’ll just put in a movie
to pass the time.

382
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,483
Let’s see. Running time

383
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,982
two hours.

384
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,185
(smoke alarm beeping)

385
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,526
Oh, the kettle’s whistlin’!

386
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,871
Ah, just the way I like it--
thick and noxious!

387
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,989
(exploding, alarm blaring)

388
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,406
Uh-oh. Better call
the fire brigade!

389
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,745
(squeaking)

390
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,540
Wow, they’re already here!

391
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,543
(whimpering)

392
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,422
So, that’s my projected
new driver’s test route.

393
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,295
Nice pres, Selma,

394
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,512
but, uh, where’s
the three-point turn

395
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,881
on this baby?

396
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,848
Um... Bailey Street?

397
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,298
Bailey Street?

398
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,268
The freshly-paved
Bailey Street?

399
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,138
Oh, yeah,
let’s wear that out.

400
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,935
(laughter,
indistinct chatter)

401
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,229
I’m sorry.

402
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,152
I-I’ve got a lot
of stress at home.

403
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:13,361
I’m wet and scared,
and the house hates me!

404
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,203
Selma, we don’t
have time for this.

405
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,319
This is the D.M.V.

406
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,405
We’re about
getting things done!

407
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,069
Abe, let’s go home.

408
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,908
How will we ever replace her?

409
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,584
Oh, I know.

410
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,289
Why is this so hard?

411
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,344
I just wanted
to marry my best gal.

412
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,379
I guess the
Beatles were wrong.

413
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,762
Love <i>isn’t</i>
all you need.

414
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,129
Abe, I hate
to admit it,

415
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,716
but maybe this marriage
isn’t going to work.

416
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,472
I guess you’re right.

417
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,894
Also, I didn’t realize
you liked the Beatles.

418
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,143
That would have caused
some problems down the line.

419
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,595
(sighs)

420
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,555
I guess I’m gonna
be alone forever.

421
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,766
Now, don’t be an idiot.

422
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:56,067
A sweet, young tomato like you
will definitely find someone.

423
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,743
Some young bruiser
who can eat corn on the cob

424
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,492
and not think twice about it.

425
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,034
You really think so?

426
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,657
Absolutely.

427
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:07,874
Now how about givin’
an old man one last dance?

428
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,535
(big band music plays)

429
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,255
So...

430
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,425
how long is Senor Homer
out of town for?

431
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,024
Oh, I don’t know.

432
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,229
He might come home any minute.

433
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,690
Then I must flee!

434
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,020
(grunts)

435
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,404
Where is he?

436
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,611
Where is he?!

437
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,570
I smell his
aftershave!

438
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,901
(groaning)

439
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,945
I don’t think
we’re doing this right.

440
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,450
Where is he?
I know he’s in here.
