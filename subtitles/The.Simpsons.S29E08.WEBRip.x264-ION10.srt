1
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,678
D'oh!

2
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:23,524
- Here's your raise.
- D'oh!

3
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,869
Light! Light! Light...!

4
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:36,904
Light!

5
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:38,706
- It's your turn to get up.
- Light.

6
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:41,175
I'll never understand
how something

7
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:44,778
that came from inside of you
became my responsibility.

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,616
Out!

9
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,284
Light!

10
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:52,620
Daddy. Breakfast.

11
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,688
Geez, this kid's kind of smart.

12
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,090
Tuesday.

13
00:00:56,124 --> 00:00:57,225
Autumn.

14
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:59,260
- She's a genius.
- Foliage.

15
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:01,929
Like the guy who invented
shoes with lights in them.

16
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:03,731
Cornucopia?

17
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:08,269
Sweetie, it's no surprise
you're awesome.

18
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:11,539
We didn't have to pull you out
by the elbow, like the boy.

19
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:16,377
D'oh!

20
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,951
Harvard College,
admissions essay.

21
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:25,886
Lisa M. Simpson.

22
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,322
I was born with one
great advantage in life...

23
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:30,958
A voice that would make a rhino
stick its horn up its butt?

24
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:33,161
Rhinos are extinct, nimrod.

25
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:35,963
Not hippos. I just saw one
in smelly, blue pants.

26
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:37,097
Why you little...

27
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:39,967
I'm not little.
I'm 20, and I live at home.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,069
- Why you disappointing...
- Oh, man.

29
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,305
You know you're choking
someone who can vote.

30
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:46,174
- But did you vote?
- No.

31
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:48,142
- Why you little...
- Oh, come on, man.

32
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:50,511
Not voting
fascist-enabling...

33
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:55,149
Must stop
President Kid Rock.

34
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:58,085
I was born with
one great advantage,

35
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,155
a family that never made
anything easy.

36
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:03,757
Never more than
on my seventh birthday.

37
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,363
It's my birthday!

38
00:02:09,397 --> 00:02:10,798
Seven years old!

39
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:14,001
I'll wear
my favorite blue dress.

40
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:16,170
I'll wear red, just for today.

41
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:17,671
It's my birthday.

42
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,773
I want bacon!

43
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,978
I can't get Maggie to sleep.

44
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:28,449
I guess I'll just have
to start using these.

45
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,454
Whoa, okay, okay.
That's enough for now.

46
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,724
Geez, come on.

47
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,595
Don't make me put you
under warm water.

48
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:44,365
I give up.

49
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,204
Anyone have anything
to say to me?

50
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:53,040
Well, of course, honey.

51
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:54,575
Get ready for school
or you'll be late.

52
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,978
Oy, this baby.

53
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,148
Lisa, sweetie, I know
why you're excited.

54
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,183
This is a very big day.

55
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:04,685
Happy...

56
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,355
hour at Moe's
was extended by an hour.

57
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,089
What?

58
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,492
<i>Happy hour at Moe's</i>

59
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,227
<i>Now he'll never close</i>

60
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:27,040
Class, today is
a very special day.

61
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:29,009
It's someone's birthday.

62
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,579
Someone whose parents
pretended to forget.

63
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:32,846
Yes.

64
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,016
And that someone is
Hubert Wong.

65
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,018
Happy birthday, superstar.

66
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:43,424
Lisa, please don't ruin
Hubert's birthday.

67
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,759
You wouldn't like it
if someone ruined yours.

68
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:51,432
I am sorry, but if you
can't control yourself,

69
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,267
I'll have to send you
to the office.

70
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:58,038
But you saying that makes me
wants to cry more.

71
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:09,850
No, Hubert.
No cupcake for her.

72
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,591
Lisa, school is a place
for sitting quietly.

73
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,992
What about learning?

74
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:21,128
No longer part of our mandate.

75
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:23,297
Did your mom ever
disappoint you?

76
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:25,098
This isn't about mother,

77
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,000
so don't say
a mother word about her.

78
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,236
Don't you dare, Mother,
don't you dare.

79
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,305
It's just me, a student.

80
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:34,775
I can't hear you, Mother.

81
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:39,947
She's everywhere and everyone.

82
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,351
I'm everywhere
because you're nothing.

83
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,954
Thanks for getting me
out of work, sweetie.

84
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,189
- Want the rest of my donut?
- No, sir.

85
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,791
What?

86
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,793
Please tell me what's wrong.

87
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,796
I can't tell you.
You just have to know.

88
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,165
- Would tickling help matters?
- No.

89
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,200
Well, that's really
all I have in my toolbox.

90
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,136
Okay, let me think.
What's today? Tuesday?

91
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,204
Yes.

92
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:09,309
That would make you six years
and 365 days old.

93
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:10,310
Yes.

94
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:12,179
It's your birthday!

95
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,448
And you forgot it, Lisa.

96
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:17,050
But because it's your birthday,
I forgive you.

97
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,353
And you're gonna have
the best day ever.

98
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:21,021
Optimism, you're back.

99
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,959
Attention, world.

100
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:29,897
It's little Lisa's birthday,
and you all forgot.

101
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,632
Not me.

102
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,134
Now I suppose I got to get
your kid something.

103
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,969
Just remember them
in your prayers.

104
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,071
Both of them? Fine.

105
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:43,711
<i>Happy birthday, dear Lisa</i>

106
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:48,382
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

107
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,084
<i>We all forgot</i>

108
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,057
And all was well,
until the next year,

109
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,592
when they forgot again.

110
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:00,060
I mean, really, two in a row?

111
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,262
Even Luigi remembers it.

112
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,432
Well, we have-a
the same-a birthday.

113
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:08,101
Makes it easy.
You, me, and Hubert Wong.

114
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:11,872
That's a-right, Hubert.
Cupcake for her.

115
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,446
As I got older,

116
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,449
I realized, as all must,

117
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:24,284
that my parents
were not demigods.

118
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,521
You are going to die soon.

119
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:28,722
Shut up.

120
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:30,190
You are going to die soon.

121
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,391
Shut up.

122
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,060
Blood pressure spiking.

123
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:34,462
Shut up!

124
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,130
Calling your doctor.

125
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,899
Hello?

126
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,267
Shut up!

127
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,935
No, they are a man and a woman

128
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:44,237
trapped in a fragile marriage

129
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:47,741
that nearly fell apart
when I turned 14.

130
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:51,479
Happy birthday! Happy birthday!

131
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,881
I remembered!
Don't tell your therapist.

132
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,950
<i>Lisa, it's your birthday</i>

133
00:06:56,984 --> 00:07:00,387
<i>Here's five brand-new verses</i>

134
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,957
<i>Soon you'll be a woman</i>

135
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:06,760
<i>Soon you'll be in love</i>

136
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:10,097
<i>Who'd be better
to take advice from</i>

137
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,000
<i>Than a man who wears
one glove?</i>

138
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:17,437
<i>Lisa, it's your birthday</i>

139
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:21,008
<i>Happy birthday, Lisa</i>

140
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:24,144
<i>Lisa, it's your birthday</i>

141
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:27,615
<i>Happy birthday, Lisa</i>

142
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:29,349
Yeah.

143
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,985
Thank you.
It's a wonderful cake, Dad,

144
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,253
but I'm 14.

145
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,287
D'oh!

146
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:37,825
Happy birthday, Lisa.

147
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,027
We miss you in second grade.

148
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,996
Oh, someday you'll
get out of there, Ralph.

149
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,165
I don't want to.
I'm bigger than teacher.

150
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,768
I broke my desk.
Teacher cry.

151
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:51,038
I'm growing a mustache
under my long nose.

152
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,243
Better use Mom's closet.

153
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,348
It's full?

154
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,955
Read me. Read me.

155
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,189
Come on, help a letter out.

156
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,026
Dear Homer,

157
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,962
by the time you read this...

158
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,129
I will be gone.

159
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,331
Since we married,
you've changed.

160
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,067
Not once for the better.

161
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,135
What's it say? I can't read.

162
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,638
So I'm taking
the kids and opening

163
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,206
a bed-and-breakfast.

164
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:32,212
Bitterly, Marge.

165
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,883
Is Mom really leaving Dad?

166
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,691
So, you finally left him.

167
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:46,493
Well, good for me
and good for you.

168
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,997
I finally learned how
to unhook a bra with one hand.

169
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,265
Lisa, I know what you're doing.

170
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,337
You're hiding when you're
supposed to help me

171
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,706
give the dog a bath.

172
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:01,341
Mom, Mom!

173
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,277
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I'm not going anywhere.

174
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:06,113
Oh, God bless you, inertia.

175
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,749
Not until I wash this dog.

176
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:11,952
Bart, Mom's leaving Dad.

177
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,220
Oh, the poor guy.

178
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,756
Please let me tell him, please.

179
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:16,957
Pass the gravy.

180
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,293
We used to call it grave,
but that was too scary.

181
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:23,731
So we modified it to gravy,
unless it had meat chunks.

182
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:28,368
In which case, it was gravier,
but the war changed everything.

183
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,707
I wish you wouldn't drink
so much in front of the kids.

184
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:36,376
Marge, I tried to drink
in the pantry,

185
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,712
but you claim
that's antisocial.

186
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:41,048
Why don't you
just go to Moe's?

187
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:44,952
You want me to go to a bar
on my daughter's birthday?

188
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:47,154
That is so messed up.

189
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:50,223
I'm going, of course,
but it is so messed up.

190
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,391
Happy birthday.

191
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,968
Harvard will save me.
Harvard will save me.

192
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:07,007
Kiss me, Lisa, in front of
the hall my grandfather endowed.

193
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,578
He made his money in opium,
but we said it was molasses.

194
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,282
First, I have to save
my parents' marriage.

195
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,017
Wait here in this fantasy?

196
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,120
Yeah, can we, you know,
see other people?

197
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,154
Sure.

198
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,373
Man, Moe, you sure are spry.

199
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,876
The job keeps me young, eh.

200
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,350
Dad! Mom is gonna leave you.

201
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,186
Sweetie, marriages
are like water heaters.

202
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,955
They sit peacefully for years

203
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:59,026
until they explode in a fireball
ruining everything you own.

204
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,527
Mom packed her bags.

205
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,196
Which suitcase?
The one with the broken wheel?

206
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,799
Because she won't get more than
a block away with that.

207
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,134
She fixed the wheel.

208
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,335
Oh, God!

209
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,672
Dad, you've got to shape up.

210
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,241
I'm 14-years-old.

211
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:17,077
These next four years
are the last memories I'll have

212
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,879
of all of us together.

213
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,380
I'll do anything
you say, sweetie.

214
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,415
I want you to stop drinking.

215
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:23,683
Stop drinking?

216
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:26,586
But that's like asking a golfer
to stop drinking.

217
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,922
I never thought I'd say this,

218
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:30,991
but I'd better text my sponsor.

219
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,392
Homer's got a sponsor?

220
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,262
What idiot would lean
into that buzz saw?

221
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,031
Hey, hey!
I'm the man from A-diddly-A!

222
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:40,433
Ned, I have
to quit drinking. Now!

223
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:43,370
All right, soberino,
it's just 12 simple steps.

224
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:44,938
Oh, 12?

225
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,039
Fine. Nine.

226
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,943
Okay, step one,
admit you're powerless.

227
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:52,079
I'm powerless.
Boom! Done.

228
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:55,615
Step two, admit there is a power
greater than yourself.

229
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:59,019
If I'm powerless, isn't every
power greater than myself?

230
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,288
This is the 12 steps,
not 20 questions.

231
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:04,291
Now, make a decision
to turn your life to God.

232
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:08,028
God. He's in every deal,
like undercoating. Fine.

233
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,197
Make a searching
moral inventory of yourself.

234
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,034
If I have one tiny flaw, it's
that I have many enormous flaws.

235
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,535
Admit the nature of your wrongs.

236
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,205
Well, I'm not
the best parallel parker.

237
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,708
Are you ready for God
to remove these defects?

238
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,643
Dear Lord, the Satan of Heaven,

239
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,545
I order you to fix me.

240
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,247
Okay, I'm just gonna
fast-forward through this.

241
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,715
- Make amends.
- Here's your wallet.

242
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,617
- Engage in prayer.
- I pray you're not mad.

243
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,685
And have a spiritual awakening.

244
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,556
Things that cost $9.99

245
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,092
are really ten dollars!

246
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:42,095
The Lord has spoken,
and it is good!

247
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,997
That's it.
No more drinking.

248
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:46,233
Look at those, guys.

249
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,301
I used to be like them.

250
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,237
Oh, I'm overjoyed for thee.

251
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,073
Call me anytime you hear
the devil's seductive voice.

252
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,507
Homer?

253
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,943
Homer...

254
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:58,445
Homer...

255
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:02,082
How's about a Flaming Moe?

256
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,352
Drink me!

257
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:09,122
I'm the most overpriced thing
at Universal Studios!

258
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:11,158
No! I won't do it!

259
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:18,866
Lisa, sweetie,
let's celebrate your birthday!

260
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,033
Yes!

261
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,801
Ah, honey.

262
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,036
I'm so sorry.

263
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,637
I miss you so much.

264
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:28,608
He did quit, for good,

265
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,312
and it was the best
birthday present I ever got.

266
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,882
Well, the essay is pretty trite.

267
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:37,717
But her grades are perfect,
her extracurricular's stellar,

268
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,353
and she'll be the first
from her state, ever.

269
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:44,291
Admit! And now for our instantaneous
letter of acceptance.

270
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:51,598
I'm in! And I accept!

271
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:12,319
I'm here! And it's Ivy-er
than my Ivy-est dreams.

272
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,587
- Lisa Simpson.
- Lisa Simpson?

273
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:17,757
I'm sorry, but there must
be some mistake.

274
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,927
- Oh, no!
- Gotcha!

275
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,929
My one moment of superiority

276
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:24,597
before a lifetime
of begging you for money.

277
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:34,007
Come on, sweetie, let me
carry you over the threshold.

278
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:37,410
Dad! That's for weddings.

279
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:39,179
I think Dad's
turning into Grampa.

280
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,413
Hey, I don't need

281
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,182
to listen to that hooey!

282
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,784
Because I make tie clips
out of maple syrup,

283
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,554
but only for Flag Day!

284
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,389
<i>By the sea, by the sea</i>

285
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,358
<i>By the beautiful sea...</i>

286
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,427
This is great. We don't have
to visit Grampa anymore.

287
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,938
Chug, chug, chug.

288
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:07,307
Really, man, I've had enough.

289
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,810
The hazing ends
when we say it ends.

290
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,946
Do you need any help unpacking?

291
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,316
Mom, I need to learn
to do these things for myself.

292
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:23,890
Sorry, friend,

293
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,159
you can't pahk your cah
in Hahvahd Yahd.

294
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,097
I can't what my what
in what what what?

295
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,631
You can't pahk...

296
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,733
- Yes...?
- In Hahvahd Yahd.

297
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,469
- Are you on Novocain?
- Yes, but recreationally.

298
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,638
Now, move your craptastic cah.

299
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,242
Hi. I'm Caitlyn.

300
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,144
My roommate.

301
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,113
So, you play an instrument?

302
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:47,747
Bari sax.

303
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,517
- Are you good?
- I played at Kenny G's funeral.

304
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,685
Ooh, she's pretty impressive.

305
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,788
Any childhood heartbreak?

306
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:58,191
My parents forgot my birthday
three times.

307
00:15:58,225 --> 00:15:59,959
She beats me at everything!

308
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:01,661
I don't belong here.

309
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,164
While you were feeling inferior,
I took the top bunk.

310
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:10,037
Stroke, stroke, stroke...

311
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,172
I'm not even gonna make it

312
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:13,673
through freshman week.

313
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,708
- Hey, little sister.
- Well!

314
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:18,045
At least you're having
a good time.

315
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,013
Yeah, these girls want me
to piss off their parents

316
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:21,614
before they head home.

317
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,218
Get away from him, Mandy!

318
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:26,719
I'll pay! I'll pay!

319
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,455
Tell him I have two kids.

320
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,091
The beauty part is,
it's not a lie.

321
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,994
You always know
what to say, Bart.

322
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:37,230
Well, try this.
I've known you all your life,

323
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:40,533
and if there's one thing I know,
it's that you belong here.

324
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:41,968
You're gonna study harder,

325
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,703
you're gonna ask
better questions,

326
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,005
you're gonna get into
their brains like an earworm

327
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,175
and chew, chew, chew!

328
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:50,543
Now, make Mom and Dad proud.

329
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:51,978
And then I'll make 'em proud.

330
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,880
- But you first.
- Thank you.

331
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:03,656
This is it.

332
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,426
I'm on my own
for the rest of my life.

333
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,197
Are you my roommate too?

334
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,866
For now.
Till they kick me out.

335
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,169
Everyone thinks
they're not gonna make it.

336
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,171
I already got kicked out
of a psycho single

337
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,174
'cause my roommate
didn't like me.

338
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:24,277
She used all the shampoo!

339
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:26,246
I just think you're funny.

340
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:30,083
So I suppose
you want to tell me your SATs.

341
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:31,918
Very much. But I won't.

342
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:33,220
Tell me about you.

343
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:34,454
I'm already homesick.

344
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,389
I was always the kid
that didn't fit in.

345
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:37,624
Middle child.

346
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,127
Artsy. And I play

347
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,729
the most unpopular
instrument there is...

348
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,764
The jazz clarinet.

349
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:58,077
You know your way
around a licorice stick, kid.

350
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:01,047
You blow a mean fish hook
yourself, sister!

351
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,117
- Let's talk normal now.
- Thank you.

352
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:06,386
You know, today
I was hoping I would meet...

353
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,255
- A lifelong friend?
- Yes!

354
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:10,290
Here I am.

355
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,393
730 verbal, 790 math,

356
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,061
800 telekinesis.

357
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:18,998
740 verbal, 780 math,

358
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,100
and I speak fluent cat!

359
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,671
I have a friend!

360
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:28,107
Maybe more than a friend.

361
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:30,109
After that day,
I never looked back...

362
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,812
except for all the time
I just spent looking back.

363
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,814
But I never doubted

364
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,250
that who I am was good enough.

365
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:02,008
Light! Light...!

366
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,943
Sweetie, you're one year old,

367
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,314
and you're already the most
amazing thing I ever did.

368
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:09,048
Daddy happy.

369
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,050
Daddy very happy.

370
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,120
Daddy euphoric!

371
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,022
She's making up words.

372
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:22,462
<i>Boy, the way Nirvana played</i>

373
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,565
<i>Steroids caused a hit parade</i>

374
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:29,202
<i>Beanie Babies had it made</i>

375
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:32,372
<i>Those were the days</i>

376
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:36,175
<i>And we had real heroes then</i>

377
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:40,179
<i>Like Jar Jar Binks
and Qui-Gon Jinn</i>

378
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,982
<i>Mister, we could use a man</i>

379
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:47,019
<i>Like Richard Simmons again</i>

380
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,989
<i>Watching films
like Gilbert Grape</i>

381
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,393
<i>Then rewinding all the tape</i>

382
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:58,164
<i>Gee, our modem
dialed up great</i>

383
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:07,106
<i>Those were the days...</i>

384
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,042
Very nice.
See you in court.

385
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,679
Light! Light! Light...!

386
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,214
Autumn.
