1
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,360
D'oh!

2
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:33,166
You sit on me.

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,867
There's a remote in my crack.

4
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,336
Problems I Have!

5
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,171
I could use a slip cover.

6
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,173
Things Your Sister Would Say!

7
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,008
No...

8
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,344
You haven't replaced me
since 1989.

9
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,246
Things a Couch Would Say!

10
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:47,615
Yes!

11
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,758
Hopefully, we won't be out
too late, Shauna.

12
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,193
Whatever.

13
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,228
And just for the night,

14
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,029
could you lose
the tongue ring?

15
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:04,397
Whatever.

16
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:07,267
Homer, is it too late
to change babysitters?

17
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,401
Yes.

18
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,036
So I'll have to stay home.

19
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:12,739
I don't think we have to...
Homer.

20
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:14,241
Yes, Marge?!

21
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:17,944
We both have to go to
Drug Awareness Night!

22
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,547
I guess we have no choice.

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,082
Here's the number
for the poison control center,

24
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,118
the allergy hotline,

25
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:27,053
and, if the kids misbehave,

26
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,888
Papa John's Pizza.

27
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:30,123
Don't worry, Mrs. Simpson.

28
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:32,091
We'll take great care
of your kids.

29
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,059
We?

30
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,627
Me and God.

31
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:35,928
Okay, then.

32
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,964
We'll see you soon.

33
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:47,073
Want to watch videos
of pythons swallowing stuff?

34
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:50,243
Can't we watch something
with kittens?

35
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,078
Oh, there's kittens in there.

36
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,251
This is pointless.

37
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,820
We learned all the new
dangerous drugs last year.

38
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:03,590
Sprack, zup, borzo,
and crystal bam.

39
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,125
I hear
they're mixing bam with zup.

40
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,327
Interesting.

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,929
Bam and zup.

42
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:12,098
This seminar's already paying
for itself.

43
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:14,667
Homer Simpson,
are you watching football

44
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,469
through your pants pocket?

45
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:20,440
But do you know how much love
is lost between these teams?

46
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,608
None!

47
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,110
Turn it off!

48
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:26,346
This bag of concentrated death

49
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,649
is what the kids today
call blizzard.

50
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,117
Allow me to demonstrate.

51
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,286
On Skinner!

52
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,955
Superintendent,
I must protest.

53
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:38,124
I'm an educational professional
who...

54
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:40,460
That's a good boy.

55
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,628
Take your medicine.

56
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,964
Oh, let's get out of here.

57
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:48,000
I guess we can watch
the PowerPoint presentation

58
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,168
in bed tonight.

59
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,371
Oh, that sounds magical.

60
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,740
Just don't be conspicuous.

61
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:57,644
Ooh, it's Lenny.

62
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,646
Homer, I found my birth mom!

63
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,315
Her name is Cheryl, and
she wants nothing to do with...

64
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,320
A wedding expo!

65
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,856
Marge, there is no way
I'd ever be interested in...

66
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,324
Is there a girl in that cake?

67
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,159
No, just cake.

68
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,528
Oh, that is so sexy.

69
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,996
After you, Marge.

70
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:19,532
Ooh, a wedding expo!

71
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:22,735
It's like going
to a thousand weddings at once.

72
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,739
Sneaking in will be the most
romantic thing we've ever done.

73
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,241
More than our real wedding?

74
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,343
A thousand times more.

75
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,346
I was pregnant,
and you had a fever of 103.

76
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,082
103.4.

77
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,785
You remembered.

78
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,533
It's so beautiful.

79
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,070
Even the prenups are gorgeous.

80
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:04,210
Your bride will look radiant

81
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:06,245
next to these hideous
bridesmaids dresses

82
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,715
made in colors
known to scare seagulls.

83
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,083
Oh, so beautiful!

84
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,452
Come back here, you.

85
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,054
You've got 12 more drugs
to test.

86
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:18,658
I both see and am God.

87
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,397
Who will protect me
when you die?

88
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,899
Nothing's gonna happen to...

89
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,402
Does this house have a mixer?

90
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,103
We could make face cookies.

91
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,742
You're gonna make
such a good dad.

92
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,413
I feel like a walk.

93
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,981
You want to take a walk?

94
00:04:42,014 --> 00:04:45,418
I feel glued to my seat
for reasons I don't understand.

95
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,786
It's all over, sweetheart.

96
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,421
The curse is broken.

97
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,923
Grandma will take care of you
from now o...

98
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,063
Come on!

99
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,302
Let's see if we can both fit
in Homer's underwear.

100
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,104
This is very sobering.

101
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,840
Why did we think
this would be cool?

102
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,641
What are you kids
doing out so late?

103
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,610
Babysitter party at our house.

104
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,779
Why don't you come inside
for a mug of cocoa?

105
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,447
Coco-nut, that is,

106
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,984
to fill your belly
with much-needed potassium.

107
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:17,985
Grins, people.

108
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:18,986
Thanks.

109
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,687
Potassi-yum.

110
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,955
This was a great idea.

111
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,024
It's like all the fun
of a wedding

112
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,959
without the boredom
of a wedding!

113
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,995
And who are you two?

114
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,829
Why, we're...

115
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,298
wedding planners!

116
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,134
Yes, and we're wondering
about your products.

117
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,336
For our clients.

118
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:40,040
Well, the Toast Master
is an AI-powered microphone

119
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,542
that guarantees
your best man's toast

120
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,978
will be heartwarming
and tasteful,

121
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:48,481
no matter how drunk
or passive-aggressive he is.

122
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,150
Give it a try, Homie.

123
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,851
Oh, I couldn't.

124
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,354
Pretend one of my sisters
is getting married.

125
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,356
That hairy-legged ashtray?

126
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,891
Give me the mic.

127
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,859
When I heard
a guy was marrying Selma,

128
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:01,995
- I thought, that poor...
- Genius.

129
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,997
- must be...
- fully sighted.

130
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,365
- and...
- not marrying her

131
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,499
to harvest her organs.

132
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,169
Thank God. The Heffernans.

133
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,870
Oh, right. That's me.

134
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,572
D.R. Heffernan.

135
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,174
- That's Doctor.
- Right.

136
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,875
Dr. D.R. Heffernan.

137
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,677
The keynote speech
is in two minutes.

138
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,014
What's a keynote speech?

139
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:24,251
Imagine Dr. Heffernan asking me
what a keynote speech is.

140
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,385
This way.

141
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,187
Finally, things are looking up

142
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,522
for the person
I'm pretending to be.

143
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,593
And the number one
new wedding trend is...

144
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,595
True love!

145
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:38,698
True love! True love!

146
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,534
Buy our book if we have one.

147
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,404
I'm starting to think
that's not Dr. Heffernan.

148
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,043
What a...

149
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:53,046
perfect night.

150
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,048
You wait here while I go...

151
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:58,718
pay the babysitter.

152
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,288
I'm not paying you!

153
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:03,123
Get out of my house!

154
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,594
- Later.
- And now, my lady, to the boudoir,

155
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,797
which I believe
is somewhere near the bedroom.

156
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,069
Have I picked you up yet?

157
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,804
I can't te...

158
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:18,972
You're so light!

159
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:23,977
Perfect end to...

160
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:25,945
perfect night!

161
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,248
Voulez-vous coucher avec...

162
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,287
What the?!

163
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,326
I guess
we should stop listening now.

164
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,627
No one's making you stay.

165
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,001
Marge, I'm afraid your days
of walking are over.

166
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:49,269
Oh, my God!

167
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,004
For about 36 hours.

168
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,773
By then, this mild ankle sprain
should be good as new.

169
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,342
It's my fault.

170
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,778
Homie wouldn't have dropped me
if I hadn't put on a few pounds.

171
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,848
Nonsense. It's not your fault
you're married to a...

172
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,783
This.

173
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,121
And it was such
a good date night.

174
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,956
Well, now it's a hernia morning.

175
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,459
See, you've got a tear
in your abdominal wall

176
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,128
and a section of your intestine
has pushed through.

177
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,963
Aren't you going to chuckle?

178
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,965
An inguinal hernia
is no laughing matter.

179
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,501
Inguinal.

180
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,303
Will I need surgery?

181
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,837
Possibly. But don't be alarmed.

182
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,140
It's just some scalpel work
around your scrotum.

183
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:31,344
A little more.

184
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,046
Little more.

185
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,215
Little more...

186
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,150
No, those are the wipers!

187
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,486
Oh, you just called OnStar.

188
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,488
Now, look, you two,
you're not kids anymore.

189
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,490
Listen to your body.
It'll tell you what to do.

190
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,993
OnStar operator.

191
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,228
What is your emergency?

192
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:52,199
Every comedian I thought
is funny is dead.

193
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:56,002
<i>The Itchy and Scratchy Show!</i>

194
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,004
Possible side effects

195
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,340
may include hallucinations...

196
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,509
irritability,

197
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,879
inability to focus.

198
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,015
Blah, blah, blah.

199
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,883
Do not mix with alcohol?

200
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,685
Fine, I'll drink it separately.

201
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,287
Boy, get me a beer.

202
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,026
What are you doing?

203
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,060
Helping you get better.

204
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,429
I was watching Animal Planet,

205
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,197
and they said,
if it can't reach its own food,

206
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,765
the hippo dies.

207
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,033
Why, you little...!

208
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,204
Bart, honey,
your father and I need you

209
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,206
to be a little more grown-up.

210
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,241
Can you do that?

211
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:35,708
I bet you can.

212
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,444
You got it, Mom.

213
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:45,285
Honey, I signed us up for
physical therapy this afternoon.

214
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,053
They sound terrific.

215
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,555
Even booking the appointment,

216
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,557
they told me, great job.

217
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,924
Absolutely.

218
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,092
I want to get better.

219
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,394
I really do.

220
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,462
I know you do.

221
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,063
We'll start tomorrow.

222
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,067
I would caution
against physical therapy.

223
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,137
Guys like us
don't look good in shorts.

224
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,276
Oh, why is it never hair growth?

225
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:12,078
It's me, your hernia.

226
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,081
Homer, your doctor told you
to listen to your body.

227
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,316
And I am telling you,

228
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,751
just take it easy.

229
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:19,752
Are you sure?

230
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,621
I just promised Marge.

231
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:24,090
Take it from your hernia.

232
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,629
Oh, you've got this, Marge!

233
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,298
Now, focus on your co-ah.

234
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:34,100
I guess I've been
neglecting my key-aah.

235
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,635
Is it this?

236
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:38,104
No. All I can say is,
if you have a muscle

237
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,441
and you know what it does,
then that is not the co-ah.

238
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,109
Oh, the core.

239
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,777
Right, that's
what I said... co-ah.

240
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,680
Now, what sports are we
gettin' you ready for, Marge?

241
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,782
Rollerblading? Muay Thai?

242
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,118
No, nothing like that.

243
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,120
I only have to be
in good enough shape

244
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,790
to take care of
an immobile 240-pound man.

245
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,492
So Homer isn't coming, eh?

246
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,661
You know,
I could go to him at work.

247
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,163
Oh, he's got
enough stress at work.

248
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,368
All right, well,
we'll get you into something.

249
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,370
Mountain biking?
Free bouldering?

250
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:15,174
I got it. Marge, we are going
to get you kitesurfing!

251
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,376
Kitesurfing?

252
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,411
I could do that with Homie.

253
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,753
You know what?

254
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,522
I'm not letting Homer
drag me down this time.

255
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:32,392
Yes, I want to learn
kitesurfing.

256
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,927
<i>Let's go kitesurfing now</i>

257
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:35,395
<i>Middle-aged ladies
learning how</i>

258
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,897
<i>Come on kitesurf-ari
with me...</i>

259
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,199
Kitesurfing's a simple sport.

260
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,534
All you need is
the wind and the waves.

261
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:45,238
And a spreader-bar, bindings,
impact vest, chicken loop,

262
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,540
donkey stick, squirrel clip,
and, of course, parking pass.

263
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:51,711
Yeah, ruining people's day
at the beach.

264
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,714
We are worse than sand
in a hot dog, eh, Lou?

265
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,283
You know there's
a double murder downtown?

266
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,286
Well, now it's a triple,
'cause you just killed my day.

267
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:00,753
Keep the kite swooping, Marge.

268
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,789
Follow the timing of my pecs.

269
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,791
Left, right, left, right,

270
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,059
left, left, right...

271
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,095
Don't look me
in the eyes, Marge.

272
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,729
My pecs are down here.

273
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,064
There you are.

274
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,266
Left, right,
left, left, right...

275
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:16,903
So, Mom is kitesurfing

276
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,306
while Dad is eating
three desserts.

277
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:22,575
Oh, your grandma and I
had our differences,

278
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:26,913
but we stopped arguing when she
disappeared for three decades.

279
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,317
Oh, it's so nice

280
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,319
to get an evening out
just with you.

281
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,953
Can I get you a baby chair?

282
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,255
No? You're good?

283
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,756
Homer's-a talking to nobody.

284
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,958
The Cat Lady
is eating with cats.

285
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:41,094
Ralph is in-a the lobster tank?

286
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,096
I'm expensive.

287
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,931
Homer, you're doing great.

288
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,634
Look at those guys
eating half portions,

289
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,669
trying to stay fit.

290
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,439
They're just setting
themselves up to meet my buddies

291
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:55,842
Torn ACL and Pinched Nerve.

292
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,344
Now, you, you're smart.

293
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,779
The most strenuous thing
you're gonna do

294
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,782
is fart
The Star Spangled Banner.

295
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,984
That's got
a difficult range.

296
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,853
Is there an easier anthem?

297
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:11,024
Hey, the riskiest thing
we're gonna do is have lasagna.

298
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:12,959
We just had lasagna.

299
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,194
Have it again!

300
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,828
Nobody's gonna stop you.

301
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,564
I love you.

302
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,334
Who are you?

303
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:24,003
Cirrhosis. What's it to ya?

304
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,976
Homer, I'm going to the beach.

305
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,479
I packed lunch for two
if you want to come.

306
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,880
Oh, the beach.

307
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,982
Sure. Let's get sunstroke,

308
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,051
a hyperextended tendon,

309
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:41,821
and wrap it up by getting
decapitated by a frisbee.

310
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,656
Hard pass.

311
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,825
Sorry, Marge. Hard pass.

312
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:49,229
It's been so long
since you made a move on me.

313
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,997
Or any move.

314
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,366
How about
if I drone you a kiss?

315
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,873
Hurry up, Marge.

316
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,842
We're gonna catch big air
all morning,

317
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,845
sleep all afternoon,
then boil a sheep for breakfast.

318
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,880
I'm still on New Zealand time.

319
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,350
Been here 12 years
but can't shake it.

320
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:13,052
Please, Homer,
you're my husband.

321
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,255
Get up and live.

322
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,890
Sorry, Marge.
I got to go with my gut.

323
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:25,598
If you don't come after me,
there's a big problem.

324
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,901
The drone doesn't count.

325
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:37,076
Hey. Can you watch the kids
this afternoon?

326
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,745
Sorry, Marge.

327
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,213
Hernia.

328
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,081
We make quite a team.

329
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,783
Who are you talking to?

330
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,052
Hey, I do not have voices
in my head.

331
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,720
They're in my crotch.

332
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,425
Just call my sisters
to watch the kids.

333
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,096
Let's drop him in the woods

334
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,098
and see if he can
find his way back.

335
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,738
Our parents are drifting apart.

336
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:08,241
And as much as
I don't enjoy doing this,

337
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,910
I need the advice
of the only couple we know

338
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,912
that seems to like each other.

339
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,447
I'm stuck with you.

340
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,949
Relationships
are simple, really.

341
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,419
Like, if Shauna's best friend
Tiffany comes on to me,

342
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,154
I make out with Shauna,

343
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:23,323
but I pretend it's her friend.

344
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,760
Tiffany. Oh, yeah.

345
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,162
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

346
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:31,464
Guys. Guys, guys, guys.
Let's focus!

347
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:32,499
Focus.

348
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,601
Please give me something useful.

349
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,136
Okay. Your parents
have just got to find

350
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,138
something they both like doing.

351
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,140
Like, I like laughing at losers.

352
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,943
And I make losers happen.

353
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,950
Common interests!

354
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,219
Of course.

355
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,357
Back now to live coverage

356
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,126
of Little XII college golf
on ESPN-D3-2,

357
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,463
your second home
for Division III sports.

358
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,465
Dad, can you drive us
down to the beach?

359
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:08,201
I have a school project on
sea turtles.

360
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:10,237
Don't listen to them.

361
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,473
You can see me?!

362
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:15,675
It's always the babies.

363
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,815
Hey. Where are the turtles?

364
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:25,051
There are no turtles, Homer.
It's a trick.

365
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,987
These kids are trying to help
you, 'cause they love you.

366
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,324
So there never were turtles?

367
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:32,359
No turtles!

368
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:33,826
I'm starting to think

369
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,329
there were no turtles.

370
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:37,930
Marge.

371
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,833
She looks so beautiful.

372
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,702
I've been such a fool.

373
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:46,072
And you forgot to get
a parking pass.

374
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,107
Our work is done, Lou.

375
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,519
I'll never let
myself go like that!

376
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,554
I'm-a comin', Marge!

377
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,457
Ew! Gross!

378
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:08,428
Homer, you're making me mad.

379
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:11,030
And if there's one thing
you don't want to aggravate,

380
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,065
it's a hernia!

381
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,872
I'm Marge's husband, Homer.

382
00:17:18,906 --> 00:17:20,707
Homer! Good-o!

383
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,709
Would you like me
to rehab you at work?

384
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:25,112
I could come right to you.
Same price.

385
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:28,381
Maybe. But now I need
your biggest, fastest kite.

386
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:29,616
- The Widdamaka?
- What?

387
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,418
Can you say that
without an accent?

388
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,553
- The Widowmaker.
- That's scary!

389
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,588
- Back to the accent!
- The Widdamaka.

390
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:36,723
I'll take it!

391
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,892
When I got married,
I took a vow.

392
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:40,393
Something, something, something

393
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,295
till death something.

394
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:49,136
Homer! Rooster your gimbal!

395
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:50,437
Rooster your gimbal!

396
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,805
What does that mean?!

397
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,340
Pull the rope!

398
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,509
The other rope.

399
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:00,580
Homie!

400
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,149
You came for me!

401
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:04,151
And I'll never leave you.

402
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,419
Except right now
when the wind blows me

403
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:07,988
God knows where....

404
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:10,457
They're headed for a wind farm!

405
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,675
Well, Mother,
looks like we caught

406
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,643
a couple more kiteboarders.

407
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:33,480
- I'll get the big ladder.
- I'll tell the hospital

408
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:36,649
their power's gonna be down
for a while.

409
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:40,787
Strong woman, I love you.

410
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,490
And I love you.

411
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:46,626
And never again
will I listen to a doctor.

412
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,795
Wait, that's not the takeaway.

413
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,830
Takeaway?
That's a good idea!

414
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:52,966
Yello? Pizza Palace?

415
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,968
Can I get a Henry
the Eight-Inch Pizza

416
00:18:55,002 --> 00:18:56,136
with extra meat?

417
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:58,505
And a side
of chocolate cheesy bread?

418
00:18:58,538 --> 00:18:59,706
No such thing.

419
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,508
Can you make it anyways?

420
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:07,014
Chief, I've got to make dinner
for my kids. Could you please

421
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:10,017
- tell me what this is about?
- Like most physical therapists

422
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:13,987
in America, this man
is actually a Russian spy.

423
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:16,356
Nigel is a spy?

424
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,191
Dimitri Nigelovonovitch.

425
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:20,660
Did you ever wonder
why he was so interested

426
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,662
in seeing your husband
at work?

427
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,831
I thought
it was close to his house.

428
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:28,001
Didn't you ever ask yourself
how a beach bum like him

429
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:31,338
could afford a top-of-the-line
2007 Saturn SUV

430
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,340
with a full spare tire?

431
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,375
I guess I didn't want to know.

432
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:39,779
Just thank God, thank God your
husband is entrapping him now.

433
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:44,517
Homer, I just need
a few pictures of...

434
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,219
the co-ah.

435
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:48,188
- The what?
- Goo-ah.

436
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:51,024
- The car?
- Goo-ah.

437
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:53,026
Like a crow? Caw?

438
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,861
Co-ahr-car?

439
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:57,897
Damn it.
Show me your reactor core.

440
00:19:57,931 --> 00:19:59,933
All units, move in!
