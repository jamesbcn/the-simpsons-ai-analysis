all night, man.

345
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,006
Just let me know what it'll take
for you to forgive me.

346
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,050
-Can I punch you?
-Sure.

347
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,894
Can I have someone else
punch you?

348
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,219
Sure. What've you got?

349
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,894
Puppy Goo-Goo coming my way?

350
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,182
(snaps)

351
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,981
<i>Ay carumba!</i>

352
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,689
I'm glad it's over.

353
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,323
I wasn't comfortable
having the upper hand.

354
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,820
From now on I'll dominate you
in ways you don't realize.

355
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,664
That's all I ever wanted.

356
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,990
Where'd it go?
Where'd it go?

357
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,785
Hey, Chief Wiggum!
Can you help me find my bar rag?

358
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,789
I can't even find my car
in the parking lot at the mall.

359
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:05,332
There was half a kilo of heroin
and two suspects inside.

360
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,627
-Hey! Hey!
-(tires squealing, gunshots)

361
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,131
Can you throw me my house key?
Please!

362
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,804
It's got a green thingy on it!

363
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:12,972
-Stop!
-(tires screech)

364
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,180
Ooh!

365
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,802
Hey, there's some
Pringles in here.

366
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,807
-(metal tab pops)
-(coughs) Nope. Tear gas.

367
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,270
-(coughing)
-(tires squealing)

368
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,520
Haven't forgotten
about your rag, Moe!

369
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,863
I'm in hell, I'm in hell,
I'm in hell,

370
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,069
I'm in hell... (grunts)

371
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,782
(wearily)
Perhaps one of you garments

372
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,744
would like to narrate
for a while.

373
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,115
Men's extra large underwear?

374
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,952
I'm saving my strength.

375
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,707
He's going bike riding today.

376
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,290
(humming)

377
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,745
-(doorbell rings)
-Come on in!

378
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,801
You've got my rag!
But how?

379
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,592
Well, during
the town meeting,

380
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,426
which now seems
like years ago,

381
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,641
I forgot my purse
at your bar.

382
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,311
<i>MARGE:</i>
<i>And when I came back to get it,</i>

383
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,811
<i>I saw how much</i>
<i>you love that rag.</i>

384
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:08,193
Num-num-num-num-num-num.

385
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,732
<i>MARGE:</i>
<i>It seemed a little "ripe,"</i>

386
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,106
so I brought it home
to clean it for you.

387
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,153
Thanks, Marge.

388
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,066
That rag is my only friend
in the world.

389
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,156
Well, that's not true!

390
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,491
Everyone in this family
is your friend.

391
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,697
Your bar is the closest
thing this town has

392
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,537
to an Algonquin roundtable.

393
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,922
What about that Round Table Pizza
run by that Algonquin guy?

394
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,251
Yeah, yeah,
okay, second closest.

395
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,126
So you's all like me?
Even you, Maestro?

396
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,174
Milhouse.

397
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,717
Yeah, I, I knew
it was something stupid.

398
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,050
Well, thanks, everybody.

399
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,056
I... I'm always gonna
remember today as the day

400
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,769
that I learned to open
my heart to human beings

401
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,810
and not old pieces of cloth.

402
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:51,614
Ha, crazy me, thinking
I needed a rag for a friend.

403
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,980
(chuckles)

404
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,571
So, this is how it ends.

405
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,825
The once magnificent
tapestry tossed aside

406
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,619
yet again like a common Kleenex.

407
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,123
Good-bye, cruel...
What the...?

408
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,668
In all my years,

409
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,634
this is a love
like I have never felt.

410
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,425
Sweet, pure and forever.

411
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,139
(sweet melody playing)

412
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,886
(growling)

413
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,596
