1
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,017
I love a good panel.

2
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,486
Krusty clearly hates
being there,

3
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,389
but he still gets super mad
when anyone but him talks.

4
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:24,558
Please welcome
the legendary stars

5
00:00:24,592 --> 00:00:26,927
of the Krusty the Clown Show.

6
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:29,663
Hey-hey!

7
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:32,266
And a non-writing producer.

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,934
Ooh, non-writing.

9
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,669
Hey-hey, kids!

10
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,438
Hey-hey, Krusty!

11
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:41,075
Have we got a great panel
planned for you today.

12
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:43,043
What is it, Howard,
the usual crap?

13
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:46,714
Oh, yeah,
that will kill some time.

14
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,957
Kids, call the police!
This isn't a sketch!

15
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:00,394
My legs!

16
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:02,062
Stick to the script.

17
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:04,298
Ladies and gentlemen,

18
00:01:04,332 --> 00:01:07,067
Miami Sound Machine.

19
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:08,336
<i>Come on, shake...</i>

20
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,539
Where do you come up
with your ideas?

21
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,441
I'm a genius. Next.

22
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:16,777
- Are there any plans...
- For another Krusty movie?

23
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,647
We're waiting for a story
that needs to be told.

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,083
Once we see that, we'll copy it
and call it a parody.

25
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:25,253
Oy. Does anyone have
a question

26
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:27,688
that hasn't been asked
a thousand times?

27
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:32,593
I have the worst fans
in the world.

28
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,728
Now we've got a big surprise

29
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:37,498
for the best fans in the world!

30
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,767
We're making some big changes

31
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,969
to your favorite cartoon.

32
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,273
It's different.

33
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:49,143
It's an all-female reboot
of Itchy & Scratchy!

34
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:52,646
Oh, my God!

35
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,083
Pretty enlightened, eh, kids?
We here at the Krusty Show

36
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,118
really care
about gender diversity.

37
00:01:58,152 --> 00:02:01,855
Ask anyone, our lawyers,
our attorneys, anyone.

38
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:03,357
A girl Itchy & Scratchy?

39
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,459
No, no, no, this can't be.

40
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:07,628
They've ruined my childhood.

41
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,963
Your childhood
is currently happening.

42
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,199
That's how I know.

43
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:12,833
It doesn't make any sense.

44
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,469
In real life,
Itchy and Scratchy are dudes.

45
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:18,172
Girl mice don't have
the upper body strength

46
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:19,373
to wield a chain saw.

47
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:21,542
Is truth dead?

48
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,644
Boo!

49
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,814
Ah, you boys are leaving me
for video games anyway.

50
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,217
Zap, zap, zap,
you'll all die alone.

51
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,118
Girl power is where it's at.

52
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,354
That movie where Superman
was a chick

53
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:36,524
made a megillah of shekels.
Am I right, ladies?

54
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,394
See?
Girls like my pandering.

55
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:43,163
Remember this if there's
ever a gender war.

56
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:45,165
Oh, this is the worst change

57
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,401
Krusty's ever made to the show,

58
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:50,338
even worse than
Sideshow Leonard Cohen.

59
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,005
When girl Itchy & Scratchy
comes on,

60
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,541
we should totally hate-watch it.

61
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:56,009
No, everybody come over
to my house,

62
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,811
and we'll turn off
the TV the second

63
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,046
that girl cartoon comes on.

64
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,215
We'll hate-not-watch it.

65
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:03,651
Yeah! Hate-not-watch!

66
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,220
Yeah, that won't not show 'em.

67
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,023
I never really thought
about Itchy and Scratchy

68
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:14,027
as male or female, but it is
cool that they're girls now.

69
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,096
I always thought
they were a married couple,

70
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,998
and that's why
they fought so much.

71
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,434
Mom, they're different species.

72
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:23,471
I don't know what to be
liberal about anymore.

73
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,908
I am so pumped to hate-not-watch
Itchy & Scratchy.

74
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,744
I've not popped the popcorn,
the lights are not turned down.

75
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:32,012
Perfect.

76
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,015
Listen, son, I'm proud that
you're starting to hate things,

77
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,049
but take it slow.

78
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,352
If you use up all your hate
when you're young,

79
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:42,055
one day you'll be an old man
who likes things that suck.

80
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,091
Tonight, cabbage.

81
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,894
It is a lovely shade of gray,

82
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:49,229
and just look at the wrinkling.

83
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:54,034
All I'm saying is, if they ever
make a female Mr. Magoo,

84
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,804
I will lose it,
I will just lose it!

85
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,071
Hey-hey, kids!

86
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,207
It's time to tickle
your funny bones

87
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,111
and your Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission bones

88
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:07,147
by presenting
the all-new, all-female

89
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,149
Itchy & Scratchy!

90
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,752
Now to sit in silence
till it's over.

91
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,954
Blindfolds on, gentlemen.

92
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,225
This is Lisa Simpson,

93
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,161
recording my reaction
to this historic moment

94
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,797
in cartoon women's history.

95
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:26,300
<i>They fight, they bite</i>

96
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:28,135
<i>They bite and fight and bite,
bite, bite, bite</i>

97
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:29,570
<i>Now they're girls</i>

98
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,004
<i>The Itchy & Scratchy</i>

99
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,340
<i>Girls!</i>

100
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,010
May I?

101
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:48,121
<i>I got my ticket
for the long way 'round</i>

102
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:50,691
<i>Two bottle o' whiskey
for the way</i>

103
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,793
<i>And I sure would like</i>

104
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,362
<i>Some sweet company</i>

105
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:56,364
<i>And I'm leaving tomorrow</i>

106
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:58,499
<i>What do you say?</i>

107
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:02,202
<i>When I'm gone,
when I'm gone</i>

108
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,838
<i>You're gonna miss me
when I'm gone</i>

109
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:07,999
<i>You're gonna miss me by my hair,
you're gonna miss me everywhere</i>

110
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,612
I knew you couldn't
resist watching.

111
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:15,182
And guess what, you laughed!
It was funny.

112
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,017
I wasn't laughing.

113
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,688
I was crying and burping!

114
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,125
And... open.

115
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,226
We did it.

116
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,629
We prejudged something
without giving it a chance.

117
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,031
I am so proud of us.

118
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:34,702
Like Bart Simpson would ever
watch a girl Itchy & Scratchy.

119
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,237
Never gonna happen.

120
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,506
Yeah.

121
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,475
That little liar.
If only people could know

122
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:44,378
that Bart laughed
even harder than I did...

123
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:48,582
All right,
you soda-squirting hypocrite,

124
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:51,385
I know exactly what to do
with this video.

125
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,993
Welcome to Josh.0,

126
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,763
the show for people who want
to look at the internet

127
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:05,165
but don't have a computer
or a phone.

128
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,436
You know what bugs me
about old guys at the gym?

129
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:11,872
They always forget
to wipe down the machine.

130
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,675
He means the blood.

131
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,446
Now, this boy says he hates
all-girl Itchy & Scratchy,

132
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,347
but then this happened...

133
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,118
Bart, you got to see this!

134
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:27,521
Some old guy at a gym
got hit by a boat!

135
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:31,291
Also, now everyone knows you're
the world's biggest hypocrite.

136
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:37,030
You said you weren't gonna
watch it,

137
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,867
and then you did
and you loved it!

138
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,071
Then you got busted and I called
you in here and laughed at you!

139
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:47,140
And I'm still doing it!

140
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:49,042
Look at you.

141
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,044
What a jerk.

142
00:06:56,618 --> 00:07:01,121
Well, Bart, how does it feel
to be trolled, memed, giffed,

143
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,390
and, dare I say, pwned?

144
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,058
How do you know those words?

145
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,327
I read about them
in Parade magazine.

146
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,330
Big deal, I was exposed
as a liar on the internet.

147
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,834
I've got so much cred built up,
nothing can take me down.

148
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,969
You betrayed us, Bart.

149
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:18,972
And worse, you betrayed
your own wang.

150
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:22,009
You know what?
Yes, I laughed at a cartoon.

151
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,944
Why? Because it was funny.

152
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,813
So what if Itchy and Scratchy
are girls?

153
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,616
I laughed, and you can't
take back the laugh.

154
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:29,950
Girls aren't funny.

155
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,019
They're hot or moms.

156
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,020
Or both.

157
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,355
Girls stole Itchy and Scratchy.

158
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,626
What are they gonna take next,
our body spray?

159
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,761
Our puka shell necklaces?

160
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,530
- Yeah!
- Lame!

161
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:45,999
Girls get everything,
bigger, softer baseballs,

162
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:49,603
chick flicks,
two-piece bathing suits,

163
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:51,471
and on House Hunters
International,

164
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:54,174
they always choose
the house that she wants.

165
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,544
He's right.
The wife gets the beach view,

166
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:59,479
but it's always a longer commute
for the husband.

167
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,148
- You know, you're right.
- Oh, yeah.

168
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:02,482
You guys see what's happening?

169
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,718
You're listening to Milhouse!

170
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:07,320
So? Maybe we are.

171
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,823
They are listening to me.

172
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:13,627
The next thing I say
must be perfectly chosen

173
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:16,463
to show I am worthy
of leadership.

174
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,731
Get him!

175
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,255
Sixth graders. Tweens.

176
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,992
What are you doing
in the girl's room, Seat Soaker?

177
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,994
No, no, I didn't mean
to come in here.

178
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,596
I need sanctuary.

179
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:52,065
Hey, you guys have
a candy machine? No fair.

180
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:54,401
Spin him till he barfs.

181
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,105
I'm full of hummus and milk!

182
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,211
Pink spray paint?

183
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:07,547
Give that back.
That's for Skinner's office.

184
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:10,183
You tell anyone about this,
you're canceled.

185
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,720
Charlie Rose canceled.

186
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:16,389
No, no, no, you can trust me.
I'm not just any fourth grader.

187
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:20,560
This dude's El Barto.

188
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:24,197
I always thought it was
that fifth grader, Eloise Barto.

189
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,099
Yeah, sometimes
I get her e-mail.

190
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:28,702
You know, if you fill up
a leaf blower with paint,

191
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,570
you can coat
Skinner's whole office.

192
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,973
- Duh.
- Double duh.

193
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,542
Where are we gonna get
a leaf blower?

194
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,144
Willie's shack.

195
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:43,383
Homemade prank masks.

196
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,185
The knit is on.

197
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:51,158
This'll teach Skinner
to ban sandals.

198
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,794
Oh, he will not
silence our toes.

199
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:55,328
Hurry, Skinner's almost back

200
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,264
from his lunchtime
dog-walking job.

201
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,639
I will not negotiate
with terrorists.

202
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:08,608
I'll just give in.
Sandals unbanned.

203
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:14,147
Ladies, that was smooth,
Barbie smooth.

204
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:15,949
So smooth.

205
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:18,285
Hey, why are you still here,
truck-nuts?

206
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,287
Is this your hideout?

207
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,122
It's the old Home Ec classroom,

208
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,691
where they would brainwash girls

209
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,425
into being good
little housewives,

210
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,027
but now it's our war room.

211
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,429
Also, we cook here,

212
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,998
we do a little bit of sewing.

213
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,800
Stop telling him things!

214
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,168
Cooties be damned,
you girls are badass

215
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:36,704
and your pranks are next level.

216
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:38,772
Take a seat and learn something.

217
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:40,941
We don't do pranks,

218
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,143
we drop awareness bombs.

219
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:46,613
Our protest crew
is called Bossy Riot.

220
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,381
We're pushing back
against the pushback,

221
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,383
starting with this school.

222
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:53,353
Look at this his-tory book.

223
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,022
Cool shades.

224
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,828
That is textbook
textbook shredding.

225
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,662
Now do you see
what we're doing here?

226
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:04,664
I think I do.

227
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:09,002
You're sticking it to the man,
but this time, the man is men.

228
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:11,038
Look, you got to let me
join your gang.

229
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,707
You know, if we're really
serious about gender equality,

230
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:16,243
it's only right
that a boy be our servant.

231
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:20,814
Okay, No-varies, you're in,
if you pass this test...

232
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,683
Steal Skinner's cell phone.

233
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,585
Work or personal?

234
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,454
- Skinner!
- Seymour!

235
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,523
Welcome to girlhood.

236
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,064
Gentlemen, our way of life

237
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,399
- is under attack.
- Hear, hear!

238
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,669
Society is trying to erase boys.

239
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,873
They give us drugs that make us
do girly things,

240
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,674
like pay attention.

241
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,677
They're putting drugs
in our medication?

242
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,079
We need to band together.

243
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:54,714
Like a sorority, but for dudes.

244
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:58,585
I give you
the Boys Rights Association.

245
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,888
B-R-A.

246
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,956
Right now,
we're just training BRAs.

247
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,392
But soon,
we'll be the strongest,

248
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:08,962
most supportive BRAs
anyone has ever seen.

249
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:12,933
We are BRAs! We are BRAs!

250
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,903
Our son has one, two...

251
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,938
eight friends.

252
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:21,274
They're more than just friends,
he's the leader.

253
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,978
I'm feeling this wave of relief,

254
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:27,247
not worrying about
my son's social life.

255
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,952
I can stop being a mother
and start being a woman.

256
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,922
Say it. Say it again.

257
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,958
Our son has friends.

258
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,797
<i>Old folks say,
you poor little fool</i>

259
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:47,567
<i>Down the streets,
I'm the girl next door</i>

260
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,570
<i>I'm the fox
you've been waiting for</i>

261
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,740
<i>Hello, Daddy, hello, Mom</i>

262
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,510
<i>I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch
cherry bomb</i>

263
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:00,747
<i>Hello, world,
I'm your wild girl</i>

264
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,751
<i>I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch
cherry bomb</i>

265
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,955
<i>Stone Age love
and strange sounds too...</i>

266
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:11,158
This is why I sit.

267
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:14,761
<i>Bad nights causing
teenage blues</i>

268
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,765
<i>Get down, ladies,
you've got nothing to lose</i>

269
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,668
<i>Hello, Daddy, hello, Mom</i>

270
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:26,373
<i>I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch
cherry bomb...</i>

271
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:27,540
Springfield,

272
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,142
a town living in fear,

273
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:32,112
as masked pranksters
calling themselves Bossy Riot,

274
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,647
spread their terrifying message
of female empowerment.

275
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,985
The latest victim of this gal
Qaeda, our once-proud symbol

276
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:40,820
of the portly
pastry-purveying patriarchy.

277
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:42,822
Lard Lady?

278
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:46,359
But a donut is the ultimate
symbol of masculinity.

279
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:49,229
The only lead police have
as to the identity of Bossy Riot

280
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,564
is this security camera footage.

281
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,502
Moe and his bats.

282
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,172
Bossy Riot is so cool.

283
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:00,974
We need fearless
female activists

284
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:04,511
to fight back against misogyny
and man-spreading.

285
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:08,248
Well, whoever they are,
they are the coolest badasses

286
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:11,751
this town has ever seen,
whoever they are.

287
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,221
Ooh, Bart winked at me.

288
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:16,823
I must be in on a joke.

289
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,597
Bart, are you in Bossy Riot?

290
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,666
- No way.
- Ah, good.

291
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,002
Because if you were fighting
for women's rights,

292
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:32,739
it would destroy my entire
vision of the universe.

293
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,874
Actually, I totally am.

294
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:40,714
You can't be an activist
for women's rights.

295
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:43,083
You don't know anything
about the feminist cause.

296
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:45,052
Sure I do.
Chicks get a raw deal.

297
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,687
I'm a little fuzzy on the deets,
but take my word for it.

298
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,024
It's all about the deets.
You're not a girl.

299
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:54,094
You just want to spray-paint
the world and watch it drip.

300
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:57,097
You've never been called shrill
just because you speak up.

301
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,934
And girls' clothing
has no pockets,

302
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:03,703
while yours are lousy
with pockets!

303
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,239
This is good stuff,
I got to write it down.

304
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,746
This is someone else's war,

305
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,117
and you,
you're just a mercenary.

306
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,419
Mercenaries are cool,
like Boba Fett.

307
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:23,156
Oh, yeah, Boba Fett,
great character.

308
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,559
Boba Fett's badass.
He wears a jetpack and a cape.

309
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,061
Pick a lane, weirdo.

310
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,097
Why does every discussion
about feminism

311
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,932
turn into an argument
about Star Wars?

312
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,968
If Boba Fett's such
a great bounty hunter,

313
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:37,437
why is his armor all banged up?

314
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,940
It's a look,
like distressed denim.

315
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,942
You shouldn't be
part of a protest

316
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:45,178
if you don't care
about the cause.

317
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:47,947
Well, you care.
Why don't you come with?

318
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,616
Maybe I will.

319
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,019
Great. Bring black gloves
and no ID.

320
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:53,520
You've been tasered
before, right?

321
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,122
It only hurts
until you pass out.

322
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,590
I'm excited,
I want to, I do, but...

323
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,592
there's a part of me
that's scared,

324
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:03,096
and that part is my body
and my head.

325
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,364
It's okay, I get it.

326
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,099
There's nothing wrong
with being all talk.

327
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,468
Us feminists need
cheerleaders too.

328
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,207
So, what's up, my fellow
Ruthless Bader Ginsburgs?

329
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:16,376
What's on the a-gender
for the evening?

330
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:19,879
Your friends in the so-called
Boys Rights Association

331
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,149
have been protesting
The Krusty Show.

332
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,884
I told you
not to light the toys yet.

333
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:28,355
I didn't,
they just burst into flames.

334
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:31,058
Krusty caved.
He said he'd never show

335
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:34,127
another all-girl
Itchy & Scratchy ever again.

336
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:37,130
So we're gonna destroy
the master tapes

337
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,866
of every Itchy & Scratchy.

338
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,168
Wait, what? No.

339
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:42,802
I love those cartoons.

340
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,471
I can't let you do it.

341
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,006
Oh, you can't let us?

342
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,212
Don't have a lady cow.

343
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:56,049
All cows are ladies.

344
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,656
That thing you said about me
being all talk?

345
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,160
Well, I have prepared
two comebacks,

346
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:09,429
and I will now give you both.

347
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:13,032
Those girls are gonna destroy
every Itchy & Scratchy, forever!

348
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,037
Hey, hey, boys and boys!

349
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,872
Well, congratulations,

350
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:23,076
I'm never gonna air the girl
Itchy & Scratchy again.

351
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:27,714
You hit me where it hurts
the most, right in the sponsors.

352
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,048
Buy 'em all.

353
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,223
We're too late.

354
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:42,195
They're going to destroy
the tapes on live TV.

355
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,197
Let's get him
out of those bras and go.

356
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:48,368
No, you can leave me
like this. I'm good.

357
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,069
We are Bossy Riot,

358
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:53,373
and we're gonna drop all
the original Itchy & Scratchys

359
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,476
into a pool
of nail polish remover.

360
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:04,050
That's crazy. We have those
backed up a thousand times.

361
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,052
Right, Howard?

362
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,055
What do you do?!

363
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,057
Don't do it.
Those shows are funny.

364
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,992
Mice killing cats,
guts everywhere.

365
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,995
It doesn't matter
if it's boy guts or girl guts.

366
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,397
Guts are guts.

367
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,599
See, the thing
about comedy is...

368
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:22,101
Bart, stop mansplaining!

369
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:23,803
No, no, no, no,
if I keep talking,

370
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,605
they'll get it eventually.

371
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,319
The fumes are burning my eyes.

372
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:47,126
Look, they're crying,
on live TV.

373
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,129
Glitterize their tears.

374
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:52,165
Mama!

375
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:10,617
Don't worry, sir,
your brothers are united

376
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,852
in blaming this on you.

377
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,828
Hey, hey! Come back here!

378
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,531
You there, sweet innocent girls,

379
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:28,034
did you see three crazed
man-haters run through here?

380
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,903
Gee, Officer,
they went that way.

381
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:33,039
Thanks, princess. Thank you.

382
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:35,242
Wait a second.

383
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:38,678
Do any of you babysit?

384
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,547
Great. Be at my house
Saturday at 7:00.

385
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,049
And if Ralph asks you
to give him a bath,

386
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,352
do not give him a bath.

387
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:48,054
So I guess I'm not
in the group anymore.

388
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,223
You were never in the group.

389
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:53,059
We just kept you around
for fingerprints and DNA.

390
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:56,195
But making those boys cry
was hardcore.

391
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:59,732
You ever think
about wearing the yarn?

392
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,701
Me? Join you?

393
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:04,237
Can I do it?
Can I push my beliefs further

394
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:06,673
than they've ever gone?

395
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,708
Well, let us know.

396
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,945
Mask me.

397
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:57,724
So spill it, Simpson.
You were on the inside.

398
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,492
What's the deal with girls?

399
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:02,094
Well, check this out,
they also burp.

400
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:04,096
No way. From where?

401
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,932
Is that even allowed?

402
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,300
Let's see, what else?

403
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:09,302
They're always telling
each other they're pretty,

404
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:11,971
their bathroom candy
tastes really weird,

405
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,674
but there's one thing
that really crushed me.

406
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:16,909
I almost don't want
to say it out loud.

407
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,578
They don't envy us.
