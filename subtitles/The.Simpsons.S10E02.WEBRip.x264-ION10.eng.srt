where my life went wrong.

100
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,562
Was it you, Bart?

101
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,233
It was Thomas Edison, Dad.

102
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,902
I thought he invented the light bulb.

103
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,980
That, too, he also invented
the phonograph,

104
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,935
the microphone and the electric car.

105
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,526
No one man can do all that.

106
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,860
You're a liar, honey,
a dirty, rotten liar.

108
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:27,293
It's true. I read it on a place mat
at a restaurant.

00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,408
Really? A restaurant?

110
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,826

00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,061

I can never go back.

00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,773

129
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,214
-They're all about smugglers.
-No, not this one--

130
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,211
"The Smugglers of Pirate Cove."
It's about pirates.

131
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,094
Excuse me, are you a student
at this school?

132
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,432
I think it's pretty obvious that I am.

133
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,049
Go, school!

134
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,564
So... this broad stands up in the ocean

135
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,730
and this big wave knocks
her bathing suit off.

136
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,940
Oh, yeah? And then what happened?

137
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,480
Omit no detail, however small or filthy.

138
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,274
So, anyway, and this is the part

139
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,148
you'll remember
for the rest of your lives--

140
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,646
Yeah, yeah, yeah, great story, Lenny,

141
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,527
but here's one
that's even more spellbinding.

142
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:52,285
Once upon a time,
there was a man named Thomas Edison.

143
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,620
And he invented the dictating machine

144
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:58,705
and the fluoroscope,
and the repeating telegraph...

145
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,630
And he was a firm believer in Fletcherism
and he played the organ

146
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,882
and his favorite flower
was the heliotrope.

147
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,505
Oh, and his middle name was Alva

148
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,681
and he never ever,
ever wore pajamas, and--

149
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,561
OK, I think we've been polite
long enough here.

150
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,599
Lenny, what happened with the dame
in the bathing suit?

151
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,393
Huh? Oh.

152
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,476
Uh...

153
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,601
Oh, nuts. I forgot.

154
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,607
All I can think of now is Edison.

155
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,480
I can't even remember where I work.

156
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,607
Well, I remember where Edison worked.
It was Menlo park.

157
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,525
That's where he came up
with the tasimeter,

158
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,993
the ore separator and--

159
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:32,953
-Uh, James Watt invented the steam engine.
-That's boring.

160
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:36,075
You're boring everybody.
Quit boring everyone.

161
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,334
And then he worked on a machine
to communicate with the dead.

162
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,286
Some kind of scary telephone, I guess.

163
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,836
Or maybe he planned to stick his head
under the ground and yell.

164
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,220
All right, already! Everyone knows
the man accomplished a lot.

165
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,549
Maybe because he didn't spend
every waking moment

166
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,554
talking about Thomas Edison.

167
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,596
Oh, that's where you're wrong, Marge.

168
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,060
He was a shameless self-promoter.

169
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,771
Well, you're not Thomas Edison.

170
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,652
Marge, that's it!

171
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,939
That's why I haven't done
anything with my life.

172
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,073
I need to be more like Thomas Edison.

173
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,651
Whatever.

174
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,986
And I'm starting right now.

175
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:12,281
No more lousy pajamas! (grunts)

176
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:15,236
From this day forward, I am an inventor!

177
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,582
Do us a favor. Invent yourself
some underpants.

178
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,088
(whistling)

179
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,432
Ah.

180
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,141
Well, I quit my job just like you said to.

181
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,311
I didn't tell you to quit your job.

182
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,929
Yes, you did. I remember your exact words.

183
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,307
You said I should quit my job
and become an inventor

184
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,765
or you'd torch the house.

185
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,315
That doesn't sound like me.

186
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,986
Well, I suppose if this doesn't work out,

187
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,779
you can always go back to the plant.

188
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,412
(chuckling) Not the way I quit.

189
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,913
Whoo-hoo.

190
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,677
At my age, Edison had already invented
203 things.

191
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,929
Oh-ho, I've got a lot of work
to do to catch up to him.

192
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,013
Let's see, now...

193
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:21,308
-Inventions, inventions...
-(footsteps approaching)

194
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,149
Something electrical might be good.

195
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,113
Eh, eh, eh. Let me handle
the creative end of this, Marge.

196
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,614
You don't understand
how the creative mind works

197
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,487
-like I do.
-Oh?

198
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,664
You look at this table
and what do you see? Just a table.

199
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,834
Now, a creative person like me
looks at this table

200
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,713
and sees all kinds of creative things.
But no tables.

201
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,212
Homer, that's not a table.

202
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,424
That's our dryer.

203
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,803
Aahh! My files!

204
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,169
Hmm.

205
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,255
This isn't working.

206
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,385
I've got to try a different approach.

207
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,102
Hmm...

208
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,352
Hm? Hmm...

209
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,685
Hmmm?

210
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,610
{\an8}(grunts)

211
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,151
{\an8}(gasps)

212
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,574
(groans)

213
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,529
(coughing)

214
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,872
(contented sigh)

215
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,997
You started smoking, Dad?

216
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,580
Yes. Thomas Edison smoked
several cigars a day.

217
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,247
{\an8}-Yeah, he invented stuff, too.
-Shut up.

218
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,130
Whoa...

219
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,593
As long as you're here annoying me,
let's have a brainstorming session.

220
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,887
Now, here's how it works...

221
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,970
Lisa, you say one thing,
then, Bart, you say another.

222
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,517
Just toss out things,
and I'll use my inventive mind

223
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,101
to combine them into a brilliant,
original idea.

224
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,107
OK. Um...

225
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,572
Automatic...

226
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,729
-Butt.
-OK.

227
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,533
-Fluorescent...
-Booger.

228
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,323
Uh-hmm.

229
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,236
Wait a minute. These aren't exciting
new products.

230
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,446
You're not even trying. OK, that's it.

231
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,706
Both of you go to your rooms
and spank yourselves.

232
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,343
Lazy father.

233
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,458
Can't even spank his own kids.

234
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,758
Homer, you can't punish the children

235
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,090
just because you can't come up
with an idea.

236
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,716
I don't see why not.
They're my kids, I own 'em.

237
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,814
(groans)

238
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,388
OK, we own 'em.

239
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,434
Hmm.

240
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:28,227
I brought you a tuna sandwich.
They say it's brain food.

241
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,482
I guess because there's so much
dolphin in it

242
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,534
and you know how smart they are.

243
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,358
(groaning) It's no use.

244
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:37,663
I can't work like this, cut off
from the scientific community.

245
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,778
You stay here and guard my sandwich.

246
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:47,248
And these should give you the grounding
you'll need in thermodynamics...

247
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,001
Hyper-mathematics...

248
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:53,053
And, of course, microcalifragilistics.
Moodavit.

249
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:57,299
Look, I just want to know
how to invent things. Tell me.

250
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,473
Well, all you have to do
is think of things that people need

251
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,264
but which don't exist yet.

252
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,887
You mean, like an electric blanket mobile?

253
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,694
Uh, oh, well, possibly.

254
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,268
Or you could take something
that already exists

255
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,484
and find a new use for it, like...

256
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,525
Hamburger earmuffs!

257
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:18,358
Eh, uh, well, I suppose
that would qualify.

258
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,946
Thanks! Sucker.

259
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,620
What... all right,
just stay calm, Frinkie.

260
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,751
These babies will be in the stores

261
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:30,618
while he's still grappling
with the pickle matrix. Gyvinblayvin!

262
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,343
(explosion)

263
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,516
(explosion)

264
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,737
{\an8}OK... I have here
the four greatest inventions

265
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,832
in the history of mankind.

266
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,618
First, my all-purpose electric hammer...

267
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,865
for all your pounding needs.

268
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,131
Ow! (muttering)

269
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,843
-Hey, hey, OK. Look out.
-(cat screeching)

270
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,304
(crashing)

271
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,177
Probably needs to be more powerful.

272
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,143
I will buy ten of those right now.

273
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,444
Now, here's my "everything's OK" alarm.

274
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:36,322
-(piercing squawk)
-This will sound every three seconds

275
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,238
unless something isn't OK!

276
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,904
Turn it off, Homer!

277
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,777
It can't be turned off!

278
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,784
(alarm wheezing)

279
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,910
But it, uh, does break easily.

280
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,115
Now, this next one's for the ladies.

281
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,706
How many times have you gals been late
for a high-powered business meeting

282
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,713
only to realize you're not wearing makeup?

283
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,836
That's every woman's nightmare.

284
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,683
That's why I invented
this revolutionary makeup gun.

285
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,469
It's for the woman who only has
four-fifths of a second to get ready.

286
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,765
Close your eyes, Marge.

287
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,560
And now you're ready
for a night on the town.

288
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,984
(gasps)

289
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:19,532
-Homer, you've got it set on "whore".
-Ohh. OK.

290
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,648
This time...
Try to keep your nostrils closed.

291
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,818
Oh, look what you did.

292
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,116
Now I have to go get my cold cream gun.

293
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,790
Dad, women won't like
being shot in the face.

294
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,910
Women will like what I tell them to like.

295
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,577
Now, here's something for everyone.

296
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,375
In the olden times,
if you were watching TV

297
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:41,259
and nature called, you'd have to get up
and walk to the bathroom.

298
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,008
It was the hardest thing
in the world to do.

299
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:48,223
But now, with the lazy man
reclining toilet chair,

300
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,104
you can just lean back and let 'er rip.

301
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,311
You expect people to go to the bathroom
in their living rooms?

302
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,983
Sure. Believe me, every man in America
will want to have one.

303
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,437
(flushing)

304
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,574
Gangway. Gotta poop.

305
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,740
No, Bart.

306
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:07,028
-Homer, all these inventions, they're...
-Yes?

307
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,164
-(groans) They're not very...
-Yes? Yes? Yes?

308
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,162
-They're terrible.
-What?

309
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,870
I'm not saying you're a bad inventor.

310
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:20,246
I'm just saying these particular
inventions are awful.

311
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,046
And no one in their right mind
would buy them.

312
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,130
Or accept them as gifts.

313
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,255
But this is the best I could do.

314
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,644
I guess I'm no better
at being Thomas Edison

315
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,681
than I was at being Homer Simpson.

316
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,482
Oh, dear.

317
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,810
I hope I wasn't too rough on him.

318
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,606
Somebody had to tell him, mom.

319
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,859
In the long run, it's much kinder to--

320
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,322
(Bart clearing throat)

321
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,951
Do you mind?

322
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:53,161
All week, my lifelong dream
was to be the next Thomas Edison.

323
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,663
But now it's over.

324
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,495
I guess I'll just give up
my hopes and dreams

325
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:00,541
and settle for being
a decent husband and father.

326
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,206
-Uh...
-(all yelling)

327
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,585
Huh?

328
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,222
What happened? You didn't fall.

329
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:11,509
Oh, that... I stuck a couple extra legs
on there 'cause I kept tipping over

330
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,175
when I was trying to invent stuff.

331
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,676
They're on hinges.
That's really ingenious, Dad.

332
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,727
It could save lives.

333
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,521
Really? You think it's a good idea?

334
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,074
Oh, yeah. Safety sells,
especially to lame-o's.

335
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,148
-I'd buy one.
-Me, too.

336
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,987
(all cooing)

337
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,149
I did it! I'm going to be rich!

338
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,996
(humming)

339
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,672
Look, Mr. Edison, I did it!

340
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:44,842
I'm an inventor!

341
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,420
And I owe it all to you.

342
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,683
See? It's just a regular chair.

343
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,588
But I attached a couple
of extra legs to the back.

344
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,138
Kind of like the ones
on the back of your...

345
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,770
Aw, damn it!

346
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,056
Hey, Dad. Heard you swearing.

347
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,024
Mind if I join in? Crap. Boobs. Crap.

348
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,574
I thought I had a great idea

349
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,728
but I must have seen it on this poster.

350
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,737
If Edison thought of that chair,
how come it's not on this chart?

351
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:15,702
It's not? Maybe he never told
anyone about it!

352
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,914
That chair might be the only one he made!

353
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:19,996
So?

354
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,540
So... We've got to go to the Edison museum

355
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,245
and smash it.

356
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,585
Then I'll be an inventor!

357
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,381
But I thought you loved Edison.

358
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,835
Aw, the hell with him.

359
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,218
Yeah! Hell, damn, fart!

360
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:35,885
(tires screeching)

361
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,021
Taking Bart across state lines. Back soon.

362
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,891
I took your wallet.

363
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,977
Oh, I just mopped that driveway.

364
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,895
Man, I can't wait to smash that chair.

365
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:53,905
(chuckling) Oh, son,
you're young and headstrong.

366
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,949
Just like Thomas Edison, Jr.

367
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,503
You know, he started a mushroom farm
and an auto parts company.

368
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,368
And he sold his good name
to a quack medicine company.

369
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,626
Oh! And later, he raised turkeys.

370
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,168
That was on his turkey farm.

371
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,591
(snoring)

372
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,756
Hmm.

373
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,101
Hmm...

374
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,314
Mmm. Mmm.

375
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,230
(muttering, gasps)

376
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,773
-Stop, Homer...
-(Homer gasps)

377
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:29,533
By smashing my chair,
you're only hurting yourself.

378
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,982
(grunts)

379
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,569
(yelping, grunts)

380
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,412
I'll get you, you fat lunatic!

381
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,873
(tires squealing)

382
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,043
Uh-oh.

383
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,174
Ooh...

384
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,718
(both panting)

385
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,259
All right, the museum's still open.

386
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,643
Why don't you like Edison that much?

387
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
(grunts)

388
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,635
Hey, folks, do you like riddles?

389
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,055
(all answering affirmatively)

390
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,984
Well, OK then.

391
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:11,322
How many geniuses does it take
to invent a light bulb?

392
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,450
Just one... Thomas Edison.

393
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,119
(cheering, laughing)

394
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,199
That's very good.

395
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,084
And that's true, too.
It's funny and true.

396
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:27,371
Now, behind that door
is Edison's actual preserved brain.

397
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,207
(all gasping)

398
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:33,053
Ordinarily, folks,
tour groups are not allowed to see it.

399
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,720
And, of course,
today will be no exception.

400
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,089
(all groaning)

401
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,716
Now, no tour would be complete

402
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,642
without a visit to Edison's
boyhood gift shop.

403
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,932
(indistinct chatter)

404
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,622
Now, let's take care of business.

405
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,366
Out of the way.

406
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,708
This is one invention
you're not getting credit for,

407
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,131
you inspiration-hog!

408
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,050
Your electric hammer, maestro?

409
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,930
Invent your way out of this, Edison!

410
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,048
Hmm?

411
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,297
Hmm.

412
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,694
Look, son, Edison was just like me.

413
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,361
You mean, the wild mood swings?

414
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,569
No!

415
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,782
We both lived in another man's shadow.

416
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,744
This old-timey nerd and I have suffered

417
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:44,031
the same frustration and heartache.
We're not rivals.

418
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:48,787
We're just a couple of dreamers
who set the bar a little too high.

419
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,544
-I can't destroy your work, my friend.
-Can I?

420
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:57,627
No, but we'll stop off
at the da Vinci museum on the way home.

421
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,260
Uh, I think that's in Italy, Dad.

422
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,472
Oh! Well, then we'll take
it out on Eli Whitney.

423
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:08,271
<i>Authorities say the phony pope</i>
<i>can be recognized by his high-top sneakers</i>

424
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,480
<i>and incredibly foul mouth.</i>

425
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,856
<i>In other news, Thomas Edison,</i>
<i>the greatest inventor of all time...</i>

426
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,479
-(both gasp)
<i>-...is apparently still inventing.</i>

427
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,896
<i>Despite the notable handicap</i>
<i>of being dead.</i>

428
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,526
That's my Tommy!

429
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:24,282
MAN (on TV): <i>Two new Edison creations</i>
<i>have just been discovered in his museum</i>

430
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,826
<i>a six-legged chair that won't tip over...</i>

431
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,711
<i>and even more astounding,</i>

432

-(murmuring)
-(applause)

433
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,172
That was your idea.

434
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,673
<i>This brilliant innovation is expected</i>
<i>to generate millions</i>

435
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,255
{\an8}<i>for Edison's already wealthy heirs.</i>

436
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,426
Dad, those should be your millions.

437
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:47,351
I got to admit, Homer,
you're taking this pretty well.

438
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:52,271
(gritting teeth) Let's just say
I'm sitting in the right chair.

439
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,112
(theme music playing)

440
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,480
-(murmuring)
-Shh!
