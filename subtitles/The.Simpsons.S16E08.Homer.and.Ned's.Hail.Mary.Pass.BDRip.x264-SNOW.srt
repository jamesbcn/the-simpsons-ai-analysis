Flanders?

346
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,685
Well, I guess you've got
some late night problems, too.

347
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,205
Yeah. I made a great film.

348
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,123
But I'm having trouble
getting it out there.

349
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,328
I'm like Michael Moore,
except I'm skinny,

350
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,448
myjeans are washed,
and God loves me.

351
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,530
(SIGHS) I just wish
I could find some way
to spread my message.

352
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,204
Have you tried checking
the oil filter?

353
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,685
Are you even listening to me?

354
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,610
Sure. I'd be happy to
tell you my problem.

355
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,808
I've got a venue
the whole world
will be watching

356
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,370
and nothing to fill it with.

357
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,487
Wait a minute.

358
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,642
You've got a medium,
and I've got a message.

359
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,643
Maybe God brought us
together for a reason.

360
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,687
Yeah. You help me and I,
in turn, am helped by you.

361
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,047
ANNOUNCER: <i>And so,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

362
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,648
<i>we have come to the start
of Super Bowl X-X-X-I-X.</i>

363
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,845
<i>This brand new $300 million
stadium was completed
just one short week ago.</i>

364
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,401
And it's scheduled
for demolition
early next month.

365
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,721
America's priorities
are a joke. Now,

366
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,006
<i>Here's the kickoff.</i>

367
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,970
Wow. All these people
are gonna see Dad's show.

368
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,922
Oh, I paid $1,000
for this seat.

369
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,810
And I can't even see the game.
Just poke through.

370
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,207
(SLURPS)
Hmm.

371
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,001
(CROWD CHEERING)

372
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,081
(GUNSHOT)

373
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,605
ANNOUNCER: <i>And that's the gun.</i>

374
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,924
<i>We head into half-time
with the thrilling
score of 55 to 6.</i>

375
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,764
But don't stop watching
in the second half.

376
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,887
Points count double.

377
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,407
And now, the eagerly awaited
Super Bowl Half-time Show.

378
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,206
Sponsored by
the new Ford pick-ups,
Citibank, and Moe's Tavern.

379
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,486
How could you afford this?

380
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,324
I hustled a lot of pool.

381
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,890
Hey, you want to play?

382
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,329
I gotta warn ya.
I ain't that good. (LAUGHS)

383
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,526
All right.

384
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,441
Sucker.

385
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,965
(GRUNTS)

386
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,326
Who's the sucker now? Huh?

387
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,121
Time for Homer's
half-time show.
Get ready, Frank.

388
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,851
Frank went to
the men's room.
I'm Joe.

389
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,683
HOMER: <i>We now take you
back through the ages
to</i> a <i>time before TV,</i>

390
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,003
<i>before cowboys,
before dinosaurs.</i>

391
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,401
<i>The time of the Bible.</i>

392
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,242
<i>The children of God
once lived according to
their father's laws.</i>

393
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,290
<i>But then
a shadow of wickedness
fell across the land</i>

394
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,682
<i>as represented by this
cloud of white pesticide.</i>

395
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,889
(ALL COUGHING)

396
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,407
<i>But there was one
righteous man, Noah.</i>

397
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,848
<i>Oh, mighty God, send a flood
to destroy this wickedness.</i>

398
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,328
Hey, you guys think
Homer's mad at me?

399
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,926
I waved at him in
the parking lot and
he stared right through me.

400
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,242
I left the People's
Republic for this?

401
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,882
Yo, Michelle,
you got a boyfriend?

402
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,041
Not in here, I don't.

403
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,760
<i>After 40 days and 40 nights,
the rain stopped.</i>

404
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,684
<i>And Noah set
forth a single dove.</i>

405
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,841
(WHIMPERS)

406
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,841
(WHIMPERING CONTINUES)

407
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,931
So God blessed
Noah and his sons.
And said to them,

408
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,721
"Never again
shall there be a flood
to destroy the earth.

409
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,041
"I set my rainbow
in the cloud.

410
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,331
"And it shall be a sign
of the covenant between
God and man." Thank you.

411
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,051
(SPLASHING)

412
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,810
(CROWD BOOING)

413
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,051
<i>All over America today,
viewers were outraged</i>

414
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,085
<i>by the Super Bowl Half-time
Show's blatant display
of religion and decency.</i>

415
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,641
<i>You try to raise your kids
as secular humanists</i>

416
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,849
<i>But these showbiz types
keep shoving religion
down our throats.</i>

417
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,611
<i>Mommy,
why wasn't I baptized?</i>

418
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,523
You see? You see?

419
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,126
I thought America
was hungry for meaning.

420
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,489
I should've just sent
a crocodile into space
like I originally planned.

421
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,921
Oh.

422
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,523
Homie, I think you did great.
And to celebrate,

423
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,524
I made omelets from the eggs
people threw at our house.

424
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,404
Dig in, everybody.

425
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,084
Omelets for dinner?
This is the best
day of my life.

426
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,289
Really? Didn't you just sign
a $90 million contract?

427
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,691
That was a good day, too.

428
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,125
HOMER: Welcome to
the Homer Simpson
Showboating Academy.

429
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,250
Today we're working on
poor sportsmanship.

430
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,409
But I like to stand
for good sportsmanship.

431
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,124
Quiet, you.
Yes, sir.
