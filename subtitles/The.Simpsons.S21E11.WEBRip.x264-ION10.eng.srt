There, there.
There, there, sweetie.

(tires squealing)

174
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,670
I'm gonna make it!

175
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,133
-(phone ringing)
-I'm gonna make it!

176
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,378
I didn't make it?

177
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:10,557
(screaming)

178
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,888
Here I am, about to start
my new life in Springfield!

179
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,055
(Homer screaming)

180
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,693
(chuckles)
What an idiot!

181
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,019
This is the perfect time
for my catchphrase:

182
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,895
"Soon you will be mi..."

183
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,573
(screaming)

184
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,034
(crash, Homer grunts)

185
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,284
(heart monitor beeping)

186
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,695
Homie?

187
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,993
Homie, can you hear me?

188
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:36,957
Oh, thank God,
you're okay!

189
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,499
(sighs)
I'm alive!

190
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,383
And surrounded by the
people I love the most in the--

191
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,091
Could you scooch over a bit?

192
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,921
<i>Our top story:</i>

193
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,336

194
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:53,386

197
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,765

purchased the ticket

198
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,404

199
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,732
7:07?

200
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,606
That's exactly the moment
I was furious at you

201
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,994
for missing our toast.

202
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,700
And now I'm the one
who has to ask:

203
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,741
Can you forgive me?

204
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,325
Oh, I'll try.

205
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,240

207
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,829

Ladies and gentlemen,
the Orchard Avenue Kwik-E-Mart,

220
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,235
birthplace of the yardstick
on the doorframe

221
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,242
that tells you how tall
your robber was,

222
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,914
is proud to announce
its latest lotto victor.

223
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,543
Mr. Barney Gumble!

224
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,620
Mm-hmm!

225
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,035
That's right!
I bought the winning ticket!

226
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,344
And now I can buy back
all the blood I sold!

227
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,342
Mm-hmm!

228
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,631
(chuckles)
Actually, after taxes,

229
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,755
the amount you will
receive is...

230
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,604
This money will go to partially
cover the cost of a study

231
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,231
to decide what to do
with the money.

232
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,098
(all cheering)

233
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,065
Barn, thanks for picking
up the money for me.

234
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,361
(chuckles)

235
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,277
Now, what should I buy first?

236
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,906
Hitler's baseball?

237
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,413
A mirror that gives me advice?

238
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,785
My advice is to buy
Hitler's baseball.

239
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:42,962
Wait a minute, Homer!

240
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,540
You can't spend
any of that money

241
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,455
or Marge will
know you lied.

242
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,134
Oh, yeah.

243
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,879
Marge, what are you doing?

244
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,547
(sighing):
The laundry.

245
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,755
The machine's on the fritz,

246
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,175
and we can't afford
the $400 to fix it.

247
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,885
(groans)

248
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,685
Here I am a millionaire,

249
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,228
and I can't even help the woman
who gave birth to me.

250
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,153
Why don't you just buy things
your family needs,

251
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,612
and leave them where
they'll find them?

252
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,453
Oh, Barney,
that's brilliant!

253
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,278
Just for that,
you can help yourself

254
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,243
to anything from this tree.

255
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,784
That's not the
money tree.

256
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:18,987
I know.

257
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:22,456
It's where I hide
my adult magazines.

258
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,458
Ooh...!

259
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,128
Oh, wow!

262
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,507
This isn't normal TV.

Please, at least
try the tennis game.

Hmm...

My puppet-- with this
wand I control it how--

269
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,491
by jumping?

270
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,321
You use the wand
like a tennis racket

271
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,986
to hit an invisible ball.

272
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,696

at a poop later.

280
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,511

A box? No way!

285
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,900

286

No way!

287

That's just what we need!

288
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,323
But how are going
to get it home?

289
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,485
You, go rent us a truck.

use someone like me
in your band?

Yeah, come on up.

351
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,711
You can play the tambourine.

352
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:40,172
I said someone like me,
I didn't say me.

00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,946
Why is the TV
back on?

402
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,084
What happened
to the video game?

403
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,580
Oh, the video game.

404
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,002
You'd think it'd be
dishwasher safe,

405
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,750
but it wasn't.

406
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,212
LISA:
Why would you put it
in the dishwasher?

408
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,262
You ruined it on purpose.

409
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,338
You want the old folks
to be zombies,

410
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,304
because it makes
your jobs easier!

411
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,014
Ooh, excuse us.

412
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,215
We tried to make the worst
job in the world easier.

413
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,926
Well, I agree it's not the most
pleasant job in the world...

414
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,728
Don't forget the low pay and
the constant presence of death.

415
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,772
Well, you still should have
let them have their fun!

416
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,686
They should've had their fun
before they got here.

00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,025

418
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,776

419
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,077
Up-- that's
my chair, boy.

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,410
No problem.

421
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,914
I'll just sit here,
closer to Mom's ear.

422
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,707
Mom, how do you think we really
got that panini press?

423
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,632
I thought the government
sent it to us

424
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,381
as part of the
stimulus package.

425
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,093
At least that's what
the letter said.

426
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,756
Well, actually, Mom...

427
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,933
Uh! On second
thought, boy,

428
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,812
why don't you
take my chair?

429
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,310
So, Bart, how's your big school
presentation coming along?

430
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,403
Oh, great, now that
Dad's gonna star in it.

431
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,939
I agreed to no
such thing!

432
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,612
Mom...

433
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,440
-Where and what time?
-Homeroom, 8:00 a.m.

434
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,145
-Never!
-Mom...

435
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,025
(sighs)
What do I wear?

436
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,032
Behold, Neanderthal man,

437
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,784
our ugliest, stupidest ancestor.

438
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,406

439
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,873
Come on, missing link,
put on a show.

440
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:03,333

441
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,285

00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,375
-Make a fire!
-(grunting)

443
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,840
-Be scared of the fire!
-(yelps)

444
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,340
-Evolve! Evolve!
-(grunting)

445
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,841
Get religious
about a bird you see!

446
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,883

447
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,795
Sprain your ankle and know
it's a death sentence!

(panting)

451
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,471
Very good, Bart.

452
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,346
Can I get extra credit for
a caveman break dance?

453
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,643
Of course.

454
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,016

455
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,153
(singing gibberish
with a hip-hop rhythm)

456
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:41,164
Homer, I need you to rickshaw
me to soccer practice.

457
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,615
(groans)
Fine.

458
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,964
Let me just get
my harness pads.

459
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,710
No time.

460
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,172
(gasping)

461
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,763
Boy, this has gone too far!

462
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:57,934
I quit!

463
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,561
Soon as I finish
these oats.

464
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,928
Hey, hey, hey.

465
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,024
Let's not get crazy.

466
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,139
If you quit, I'm telling
Mom everything.

467
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,016
Not if I tell her first.

468
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:08,858
(moans)

469
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,689
Now how am I supposed to
get to soccer practice?

470
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,815
Hey, Milhouse, want a turn
pulling my rickshaw?

471
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,992
Okay, but just 'cause
I'm your best friend,

472
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,991
don't be afraid
to use that whip.

473
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,874
Okay, I'm taking off
the blindfold.

474
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,793
Surprised?

475
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,042
Well, I kind of got a clue

476
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,673
when I heard that
"ballooning safety" video.

477
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,340
Marge, soaring above the
forgiving beauty of nature,

478
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,670
I have something
to confess.

479
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,045
Um... I wasn't there
for that wedding toast

480
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,724
because I was buying
a lottery ticket.

481
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,053
You were what?!

482
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,888
You have a right to be angry.
Furious!

483
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,523
And even though that ticket
won a million dollars...

484
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,271
We've got a million dollars?!

485
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,852
Screw the toast!

486
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,857
Uh, yes, well, um...

487
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,519
taxes took out a lot,

488
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,938
I spent a ton on those
things for the family,

489
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,197
and, um, I didn't know
you could rent a balloon.

490
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,950
(sighs)
So we're right back

491
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,082
where we used to be.

492
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,199
Yes, but I have one more
thing to show you.
