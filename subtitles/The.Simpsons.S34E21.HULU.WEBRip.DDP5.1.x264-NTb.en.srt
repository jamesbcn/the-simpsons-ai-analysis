1
00:00:03,674 --> 00:00:06,684
(humming happily)

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,950
Oh Krusty-o, oh Krusty-o,

3
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:11,691
wherefore art thou, Krusty-o?

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,790
Yo, yo, Julie-ech.

5
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:17,074
To pie or not to pie?

6
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:19,267
That is no question!

7
00:00:19,272 --> 00:00:20,582
(laughs)

8
00:00:20,575 --> 00:00:24,715
(crickets chirping)

9
00:00:24,716 --> 00:00:26,416
Well, the crickets get it,

10
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:28,319
and they're the toughest
insects to please.

11
00:00:28,323 --> 00:00:30,563
But what happened
to my audience?

12
00:00:30,562 --> 00:00:31,502
(snores)

13
00:00:31,496 --> 00:00:34,236
This is supposed
to be a kids' show.

14
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:37,065
Sorry, Krusty. Kids
are no longer into your show.

15
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:39,054
Yeah, kids prefer
TikTok, Instagram,

16
00:00:39,045 --> 00:00:40,775
going to church,
dentist appointments,

17
00:00:40,782 --> 00:00:42,382
even getting bullied.

18
00:00:42,384 --> 00:00:44,324
The only way
we can get an audience

19
00:00:44,322 --> 00:00:46,662
is to bring in loose seniors
who are lost at the mall.

20
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,330
We were lied to.

21
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,740
We were promised
air conditioning.

22
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:52,635
There is air conditioning.

23
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:54,409
Turn it down! I'm freezing!

24
00:00:54,408 --> 00:00:56,778
Okay, so maybe I did lose touch

25
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,180
with my audience in the '90s.

26
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,823
- What year is this?
- (whispers)

27
00:01:00,822 --> 00:01:02,562
2000 and what?!

28
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,699
I need new material.
Where are my writers?

29
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:07,326
(whispers)

30
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:09,514
They're buried where?!

31
00:01:09,506 --> 00:01:10,436
(groans)

32
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,150
I tell you, Krusty,

33
00:01:13,146 --> 00:01:15,846
the heyday of
the TV clown ended

34
00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:17,922
when parents
found out that Ovaltine

35
00:01:17,923 --> 00:01:21,303
was just sugared mud. (laughs)

36
00:01:21,296 --> 00:01:22,896
Everyone's gotten out.

37
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:24,439
Oingo, Boingo,

38
00:01:24,435 --> 00:01:26,905
Penny Nickels, Knick Knack, Paddywhack,

39
00:01:26,907 --> 00:01:28,307
the cast of <i>The View,</i>

40
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,780
Dungaree Dave, Sadsy.

41
00:01:30,782 --> 00:01:32,892
Sad to see Sadsy go.

42
00:01:32,886 --> 00:01:34,886
Oh, not Leaky Pants.

43
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,330
He'd never quit.
He was born to it.

44
00:01:37,328 --> 00:01:40,328
When his mother's water broke,
it was seltzer.

45
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:41,644
Cheese for your scampi?

46
00:01:41,637 --> 00:01:43,707
Leaky? No!

47
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:46,678
Also, can I buy all
your material for $7,800?

48
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,850
No way.

49
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:50,591
Fine, I'll just steal it.

50
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:53,888
Little Debbie Dimples,
you're the wisest of us all.

51
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:55,134
What do we do?!

52
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,600
I don't know.

53
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,970
I'm as cute and
adorable as I ever was.

54
00:01:59,973 --> 00:02:01,943
Check out my trademark pout.

55
00:02:01,944 --> 00:02:03,314
(forced laugh)

56
00:02:03,313 --> 00:02:06,653
Oh, it hurts so much to do that.

57
00:02:06,654 --> 00:02:08,694
(hacking coughs)

58
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,200
What we need is
new, young clowns.

59
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,369
But who's teaching 'em? Nobody.

60
00:02:16,372 --> 00:02:19,412
Wait a minute. If I started
a school for clowns,

61
00:02:19,412 --> 00:02:21,182
I could save our profession.

62
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,592
But would I make money?

63
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:25,055
What's private school
tuition these days?

64
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:26,687
(whispering)

65
00:02:27,529 --> 00:02:29,899
Yow!

66
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,300
Yeah, hey, you could sell
the students comedy props.

67
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:36,714
Like those dollar sign contacts
you're wearing. (chuckles)

68
00:02:36,714 --> 00:02:37,784
It's not a prop.

69
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,922
It's scarring from
a drive-through LASIK's clinic.

70
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,130
Little tip: Put the car in park.

71
00:02:43,126 --> 00:02:46,996
Dimples, this
school idea is genius.

72
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,401
Any more advice?

73
00:02:48,403 --> 00:02:52,043
Yes. The most important
thing in comedy is...

74
00:02:52,044 --> 00:02:53,184
is...

75
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:55,789
uh, um...

76
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:57,185
What? What?!

77
00:02:57,187 --> 00:02:59,187
Fine, don't tell me.

78
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:00,761
What is it?
What could it be?

79
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:02,932
Why won't she tell me?

80
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,202
Is it being funny?

81
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:06,011
Is it big shoes? What?

82
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:06,905
Now, listen here, Bozo,

83
00:03:06,907 --> 00:03:09,177
you can't just open a school

84
00:03:09,178 --> 00:03:10,478
and expect to be certified.

85
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,920
That's right, you need
psychological evaluations,

86
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:15,421
educational degrees.

87
00:03:15,424 --> 00:03:18,864
I think you'll find
every document you need

88
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:20,674
in this envelope.

89
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:23,708
No cash.
Now I only take Griftr.

90
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:24,778
See?

91
00:03:24,776 --> 00:03:27,306
Now, about the curriculum.
Will you teach STEM?

92
00:03:27,314 --> 00:03:31,364
Sure will. Slapstick, tumbling,
enormous shoes and mime.

93
00:03:31,355 --> 00:03:33,385
Mime?! Yeah, forget it.

94
00:03:33,393 --> 00:03:35,573
Hey, that's great.

95
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:37,595
Would you like to teach
mime at my school?

96
00:03:38,336 --> 00:03:39,866
You've got the job.

97
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:41,083
Sign here. Oh, no.

98
00:03:41,075 --> 00:03:43,345
The wind blew the papers away.

99
00:03:43,346 --> 00:03:46,286
Oh, catch them and put
them in your magic box.

100
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:51,733
(shoes squeaking)

101
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:56,171
Clowning is now
the most despised profession

102
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:59,252
in America after
Supreme Court justice.

103
00:03:59,245 --> 00:04:01,015
But that will change.

104
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:03,385
We will lift
our clown horns high

105
00:04:03,386 --> 00:04:07,626
and tell the world,
"Agagabawoogakazowie!"

106
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:09,169
(horns honk)

107
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:13,465
Now, let's pull together
as only clowns can.

108
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:15,013
(hysterical laughing)

109
00:04:16,814 --> 00:04:19,594
Well, whatever the hell
this is, it's starting.

110
00:04:19,586 --> 00:04:20,956
<i>ANNOUNCER:

111

117
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,388
Teachers. They have it so easy.

118
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:38,515
They get to buy their own
classroom equipment,

119
00:04:38,524 --> 00:04:40,804
and people tell them what
they can and can't teach.

120
00:04:40,795 --> 00:04:41,955
What a racket.

121
00:04:41,964 --> 00:04:45,244

00:04:45,237 --> 00:04:47,267

00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:12,731
I have to go there.

134
00:05:12,725 --> 00:05:16,065
You're doing just fine
at Springfield Elementary.

135
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,495
No, I'm not. In fact,

136
00:05:17,502 --> 00:05:19,412
here are several notes
from my teachers.

137
00:05:19,405 --> 00:05:21,975
(Marge groaning)

138
00:05:24,215 --> 00:05:25,445
This could be the chance for me

139
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,120
to turn my
sucked-up life around.

140
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,090
I'll be like Lisa, but fun.

141
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:31,101
Hey.

142
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:32,695
- Mm.
- Objection withdrawn.

143
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,339
Look at it this way, guys.
You got to straighten me out.

144
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:38,777
It's either this way
or Catholic school.

145
00:05:38,777 --> 00:05:40,277
Catholic school?

146
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,550
(both gasp)

147
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,420
<i>Te deum laudamus:

148
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:47,491
<i>Te aeternum patrem omnis

149
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:48,664

<i>- Tibi omnes Angeli;</i>

00:05:52,004 --> 00:05:54,044
Okay, okay, you got it.

152
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,481
Kid, your grades are
nothing to "hey, hey" about,

153
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:59,251
so sell me on you.

154
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:02,731
Well, sir, I've been voted
class clown three years running.

155
00:06:02,725 --> 00:06:05,055
Impressive.
I never won anything.

156
00:06:05,063 --> 00:06:06,673
My publicist got me one of those

157
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:10,167
"In Memoriam" segments once,
but I was alive.

158
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:14,223
(somber music plays)

159
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:16,345
It was great
to see my face up there,

160
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:17,722
although it got booed.

161
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:19,462
Still, this application has...

162
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,158
What's the educational
term for it?

163
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:23,774
"The stink of a loser."

164
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:25,137
Oh, man.

165
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:26,736
Wait a minute. Now, see here.

166
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,910
Maybe my kid is a loser,
but he's an alpha loser.

167
00:06:29,913 --> 00:06:32,793
The one that all
the other losers blindly follow.

168
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:35,085
Whatever Bart's joining,
I'm joining.

169
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,500
And I'll pay whatever it takes.
Here are all my pin numbers.

170
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:40,996
Take them. Come on, take them.

171
00:06:42,705 --> 00:06:45,405
Kid, you've shown me the way.

172
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,350
The bottom of the barrel
is lined with gold.

173
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:51,159
Now bring me every
rotten apple in the barrel.

174
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,390
Hmm.

175
00:06:53,393 --> 00:06:57,133
Krusty, mein old pal.
Showbiz man hug.

176
00:06:57,134 --> 00:06:59,244
(groaning):
Yeah.

177
00:06:59,238 --> 00:07:01,708
I want to present
mein son, Dieter.

178
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,520
I think he would be an excellent
candidate for your <i>akademi.</i>

179
00:07:05,518 --> 00:07:07,658

Okay, but I feel guilty.

To be with his family

233

364

365
00:14:55,423 --> 00:14:59,503
Education is
the last untapped scam

366
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,768
left in America.

367
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:03,708
Plus, I've always admired
the stone-cold ruthlessness

368
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:06,147
of teachers unions.

369
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:07,675

your knuckles goodbye.

Fat Tony, let me
be honest with you.

373
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,295

374
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:17,996
two personal shoppers
and a Shabbos goy.

375
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:20,242

for me to give.

376
