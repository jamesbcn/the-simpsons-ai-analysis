{\an8}Which one of our girls

{\an8}"He looked so sexy,

{\an8}Well, that's a tough one,

13
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,735

{\an8}Mr. Simpson, my husband and I
have decided to move.

20
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,339
{\an8}Going to run out the clock
in Florida, eh?

21
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,843
{\an8}Yes. Well,
there's a few things

22
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,336
{\an8}you could do
to help us sell our home.

23
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,307
{\an8}First, whenever you walk
in front of your window,

24
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:40,768
{\an8}-could you please wear pants?
-Mmm, no.

25
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,190
{\an8}Second, could you please take in
your jack-o'-lanterns

26
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,110
{\an8}from past Halloweens?

27

{\an8}Mmm, no.

28
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,569
{\an8}And please cover your garbage.

29
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,072
{\an8}It's attracting wildlife.

00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,203

35
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,995
Hello. What's this?

36
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:10,054
Wire hangers, expired medicine,
old newspapers...

37
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,800
(gasping)

38
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,971
Okay, Homer, stay calm.

39
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,010
Just quietly get this stuff
inside your house.

40
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,015
Homer, you're not listening.

41
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,771
That medicine's not for you.

42
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,233
Come on, Marge.

43
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,692
Maybe I'm not getting enough...

00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,072
"Estrogen."

45
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,529

00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,710
<i>-Okay.</i>

53
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,593
<i>Set sail</i>

00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,051
Aye, aye, Captain.

55
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,761
Marge, we're going
to that restaurant.

56
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,262
But I think
I'm allergic to seafood.

57
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,103
The last time I ate shrimp,

58
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,019
my throat closed up
and I went into convulsions.

59
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,978
Mmm... shrimp.

60
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,308
Now, I don't know much
about haggling or bargaining,

61
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,685
so why don't we just agree
to pay whatever the Winfields want.

62
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,863
-That could work.
-(belch in distance)

63
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,742
-What was that?
-Sigh.

64
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,990
HOMER:
Hmm? There you are.

65
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,283
Thought you could get away, huh?

66
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,487
Good-bye.

67
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,995
Hmm!

68
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,089
I don't think
we should be down here.

69
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,342
Nervous, Lise?
I don't blame you.

70
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,554
This is where the Winfields hid
their mutated son.

71
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,926
Bart! The Winfields
didn't have a son.

72
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,773
See that sock over there?

73
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,678
It was his only friend.

74
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,477
Hello, Lisa.

75
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,940
Here in the dark
you won't need those eyes.

76
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,151
Let me have them.

77
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,571
Bart! That's not funny.

78
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:56,109
There are some who say
the monster is still...

79
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,154
-here!

-GIRL: Hey, kid, wake up.
-BART: Who are you?

87
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,166
I'm Laura, your new neighbor.
You all right?

88
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,764
<i>She's beautiful.</i>
<i>Say something clever.</i>

89
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,260
I fell on my bottom.

00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,142
Oh, not again.

93
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,636
My mother's inside,
Mrs. Simpson.

94
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,057
Please go right on in.

95
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:34,015
Oh, you speak so politely
to adults.

96
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,107
My upbringing
was painfully strict, ma'am.

97
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,442
That's sweet.

98
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,948
{\an8}MARGE: And finally,
Moe's tavern has contributed a coupon

99
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,871
{\an8}as their way of saying
"Welcome to Springfield."

100
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,001
Thank you,
this is all so nice.

101
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,958
I actually had some doubts
about moving to Springfield.

102
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,789
Especially after
that <i>Time</i> cover story,

103
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,415
"America's Worst City."

104
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,842
-You can see our house in that photo.
-Oh.

105
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:01,681
{\an8}And this is for the man
of the house...

106
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,509
Mmm... which I guess is you.

107
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,516
-Mmm.
-I guess I should explain.

108
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,309
Laura's father and I
divorced two years ago.

109
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,524
They're so sweet
when you marry them.

110
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,574
But soon it's just
career, career, career.

111
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,568
My hammock!
Do you understand?

112
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,401
Mine! Don't look that way.

113
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,276
(groans)

114
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,323
I bet you don't know
this one.

115
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,447
How would you like
a hurts doughnut? Ow!

116
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,743
Hurts, don't it?
(chuckles)

117
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,747
Right. Do you know
what a wet willy is?

118
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,669
Is it this?

119
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,709
Hey, baby, how about putting
your finger in my ear?

120
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,673
I don't know. Your boyfriend
looks like the jealous type.

121
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,585
-Hey, what the--
-That kid's messing with our minds.

122
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,644
-Let's get out of here.
-Now, where were we?

123
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,559
-Oh, yeah, I was gonna tell your fortune.
-Huh?

124
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,599
Oh, man, you're gonna be rich.

125
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,603
Whoa!

126
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,944
There's your mansion.

127
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,899
There's the tennis court.

128
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,769
(hawks and spits)
And there's the swimming pool.

129
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,936
See you later, Bart.
(chuckles)

130
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,276
I'll never wash this hand
again.

131
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,284
LISA: Dad, make Bart
wash his hand.

132
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:11,077
Sorry, Lise, I no longer
control the hand.

133
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,792
-The hand controls me.
-Dad!

134
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,673
Shut up,
you little monsters!

135
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,250
Hello, I was wondering if you'd
like to baby-sit my little angels?

136
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,707
Sorry. This isn't Abby.

137
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,757
This is her sister.
I look after her now.

138
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,971
No, Bart, put it down.

139
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:31,142
Put it down, Bart.
Bart, put it down.

140
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,144
Aw, no all-you-can-eat
seafood.

141
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,807
I wore my extra-loose pants
for nothing.

142
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,606
Nothing!

143
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,859
-Maybe Laura could watch us.
-Oh, I get it.

144
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,363
Bart, the baby-sitter's here.

145
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,235
Let me tuck you in.
(kissing)

146
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,333
Silence!

147
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,869
Huh?

148
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,082
(yells)

149
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:56,212
Maybe it's time
I washed my hand.

150
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,960
I'll send Laura over
to baby-sit

151
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,342
as soon as she gets home.

152
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,799
Great. Oh, and there was
something else--

153
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,380
something I was supposed
to tiptoe around.

154
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,927
-My divorce.
-That's it. Whoo-hoo!

155
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,561
I'm glad one of us
remembered.

156
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,008
That could have been
embarrassing.

157
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,678
Well, I know what
you're thinking,

158
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,806
and the answer is yes.

159
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,522
I want to be fixed up

160
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,562
with one of your friends
as soon as you can arrange it.

161
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:22,686
After all, Homer,
I do have the normal appetites.

162
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,985
(chuckles)
I know what you mean.

163
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,279
Just let me make sure
we're not talkin' about food.

164
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,833
-I'm not.
-Right. Me neither.

165
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,488
-We're talking about sex, right?
-Right.

166
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,447
I hear you loud and clear.

167
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,787
(purrs)

168
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,622
Bart, are you taking a bath?

169
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,248
Yes, I am,
and it would be nice

170
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,844
to have a little privacy
around here for a change.

171
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,760
This wouldn't have anything to do
with Laura coming over, would it?

172
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,340
Hey, sometimes a guy just likes
his skin to look its yellowist.

173
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,467
Why, Laura,
what a pleasant surprise.

174
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,678
Cute. What do you
guys want for dinner?

175
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,137
I don't care.

176
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,187
Ask Hef over there.

177
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,860
Ladies' choice.

178
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:06,691
(clock ticking)

179
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,277
Sometimes I think you want
to fail!

180
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,623
Shut up. Just shut up!

181
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,119
(ringing)

182
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,865
We used to eat this

183
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,084
when my dad was stationed
in Vandahar.

184
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,165
Take your kafta bi sanya
and dip it in the labna.

185
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,711
Now that is good labna.

186
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,974
I'm sorry, ma'am, but everything
on the menu has fish in it.

187
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,644
What about the bread?
Does that have much fish in it?

188
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:39,143
-Yes.
-Well, I have some Tic-Tacs in my purse.

189
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,647
Excellent choice.
And for the gentleman?

190
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,729
All you can eat!
All you can eat!

191
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,364
All right, when you're ready,
take this plate over--

192
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,235
Please, don't take
the steam tray. Sir!

193
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,200
Come on, Bart,
if I can teach Maggie to waltz,

194
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,490
I can teach you.

195
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,246
Just follow me
and put your hand on my hip.

196
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,539
(voice cracking)
Okay.

197
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,881
<i>♪♪ (waltz)</i>

198
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,931
-Wedgie!
-Whoa.

199
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,228
(neon sign buzzing)

200
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,689
(chomping and chewing)

201
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,940
(snoring)

202
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,402
That man ate all our shrimp

203
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,994
and two plastic lobsters.

204
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,529
'Tis no man.

205
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,362
'Tis a remorseless
eating machine.

206
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,697
Arrrggg.

207
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,872
Six bells.
Time for closing.

208
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,541
Can't talk.
Eating.

209
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,459
Fairly warned be thee, says I.
(snapping fingers)

210
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,789
Hey. Hey!

211
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,127
(Homer yelling)

212
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,179
But the sign said
"All you can eat."

213
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,389
Mmm.

214
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,389
I'm going to fight
this thing.

215
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,511
Oh, please don't.

216
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,058
For me.

217
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,521
Sorry, Marge,
this is my quest.

218
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,232
I'm like that guy.
That Spanish guy.

219
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,063
You know,
he fought the windmills?

220
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,188
-Don Quixote?
-No, that's not it.

221
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,685
What's his name?
The Man of La Mancha.

222
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,566
-Don Quixote.
-No!

223
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,743
I really think that was
the character's name, Don Quixote.

224
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,033
Fine.
I'll look it up.

225
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,333
Well, who was it?

226
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,251
-Never mind.
-Mm-hmm.

227
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,500
(bell ringing)

228
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,957
Oh, no, here comes
the conservative judge.

229
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,218
<i>(judge growling)</i>

230
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,300
-Plead insanity. Plead insanity!
-It's not working.

231
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,256
All right. Hit the change
of venue button! Now!

232
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,348
Oh, no,
you're in Texas.

233
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,685
If I'd hit the remorse button
one more time I would have made it.

234
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,775
Oh, Bart, I gotta go.
See you around.

235
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,990
-I am thinking you like this girl, yes?
-How did you know?

236
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,333
My ceiling mirrors and video cameras
sometimes see more

237
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,539
than who is
about to shoot me.

238
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,910
All you can eat. Ha!

239
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,457
Mr. Simpson, this is
the most blatant case

240
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,501
of fraudulent advertising
since my suit

241
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,205
against the film
the <i>Neverending Story.</i>

242
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,126
So, do you think
I have a case?

243
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,755
Homer, I don't use the word
"hero" very often,

244
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:21,313
but you are the greatest hero
in American history.

245
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,099
(cheering)

246
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,443
-I'm here to see my Grampa.
-Here I am, sonny.

247
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,899
You're not my Grampa.

248
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,728
Aw, come on,
give me a chance.

249
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,565
Hey, can your grandfather
do this?

250
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,820
Hey! Ha! Hoo!

251
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,822
Hey! Ha! Hoo!

252
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:37,994
Hey! Ha! Oh!

253
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,282
Bart! Aw, you remembered
my birthday.

254
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,247
Huh? Oh, I sure did.

255
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,249
Here's a bus schedule.

256
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,291
Wow! Fits right in my pocket.

257
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,496
Grampa, I need some advice.

258
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,666
Did you ever have a crush
on an older woman?

259
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:58,215
I had a crush
on the oldest woman.

260
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,300
120 years old, she was.

261
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,556
Here's a picture of her
delivering Eubie Blake.

262
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,519
What happened?

263
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,978
She fell in with that
Guinness Book of Records crowd.

264
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,480
Suddenly she didn't
have any time for me.

265
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:15,234
Oh, I wore a 15-pound
beard of bees

266
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,567
for that woman,
but it just wasn't enough.

267
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,493
Dad, I have some questions
about women.

268
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:25,453
Uh, can't you see I'm reading
the... cultural calendar?

269
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,456
Ooh, "Mostly Mozart" is in town.

270
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,418
Homer, Bart's at
a very curious age.

271
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,039
As his father,
I think you should have

272
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,877
a frank and earthy
discussion about...

273
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,882
Mmm, you know.

274
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,264
But Marge,
I think he should learn

275
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,840
about it
the same way I did.

276
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,755
Are you sure?

277
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,264
Hmm...

278
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,096
Zoo keeper! Zoo keeper!

279
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,233
Those two monkeys
are killing each other.

280
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,310
(whispers)
They're having sex.

281
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,314
Oh.

282
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,105
Maybe you're right.

283
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,519
Now if you'll excuse us...

284
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,568
this is a sacred moment
between a boy and his father.

285
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:03,452
Son, a woman
is a lot like, um...

286
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,372
a refrigerator.

287
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,081
They're about six feet tall,
300 pounds.

288
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,752
They make ice, and...

289
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,291
Oh, wait a minute.

290
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,344
Actually, a woman
is more like a beer.

291
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,459
They smell good,
they look good.

292
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,796
You'd step over your own
mother just to get one.

293
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,934
But you can't stop at one.

294
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,850
You want to drink
another woman.

295
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,728
So I says, "Yeah?
If you want that money,

296
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,520
"come and find it,

297
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,813
"'cause I don't know
where it is, you baloney.

298
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:39,487
You make me want to retch."

299
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,528
(snoring)

300
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:48,156
Hmm, how can I get her
to notice me?

301
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,464
Meet me at the tree house, Bart.

302
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,419
And come alone.

303
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,629
(gulps)

304
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,635
Thanks for coming.

305
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,968
(voice cracks)
I please to aim.

306
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,223
I'm so happy.

307
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,354
I just had to tell someone.

308
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,981
I have a boyfriend.

309
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,812
You won't be needing this.

310
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,397
(pumping)

311
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,741
(groaning)

312
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,739
A boyfriend?

313
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,118
I really think
you'd like him, Bart.

314
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,115
His name's Jimbo.

315
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,626
Jimbo Jones?

316
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,341
(toilet flushing)

317
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,881
-(muffled yelling)
-(knocking)

318
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,795
You've been flushing
for 20 minutes.

319
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,144
Is there a problem?

320
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,388
Uh... no, Principal Skinner.

321
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,771
Very well.
I'll continue to wait.

322
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,769
-(toilet flushing)
-(Skinner humming)

323
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,482
(whistling)

324
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,192
(flushing continues)

325
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,107
How can you like that guy?

326
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,282
I don't know, maybe
'cause he's an outlaw.

327
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,741
You know that dead body

328
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,241
they found
behind the mayor's house?

329
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,623
Jimbo killed him?

330
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,989
No, but he poked him
with a stick.

331
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:16,327
Hey, Laura,
Dr. Tongue has arrived.

332
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,245
That's him, Bart.

333
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,714
-Who's the dork?
-Leave him alone.

334
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,094
He's just a kid.

335
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,841
(echoing)
Just a kid...

336
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,933
I'll show them
who's just a kid.

337
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,088
MARGE:
Bart, it's your bedtime.

338
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,847
I laid out your jammy-jams.

339
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,929
(groans)

340
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,513
(growling and chomping)

341
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,305
Dad, if there's
a really special girl

342
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,104
and she likes some clod
who's beneath her,

343
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,438
what should you do?

344
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,822
I married her.

345
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,819
(chuckles)

346
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:44,941
Homer, please.

347
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,067
(hiccups)
I just had eggs.

348
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,914
Good luck in your trumped-up
lawsuit, Dad.

349
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,370
Thanks.
That means a lot to me.

350
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,042
All right, you guys, I want you guys
in bed before Jimbo gets here.

351
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,041
What do you like about him?

352
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,383
He's just a good-looking rebel
who plays by his own rules.

353
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,089
-(sighing)
-(sighing)

354
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,999
'Twas a moonless night,

355
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,048
dark as pitch,
when out the mist

356
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,972
came a beast
more stomach than man.

357
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,852
-Hey!
-So I says to me bosun's:

358
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,969
"Batten down
the mizzenmast, mateys."

359
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,846
Captain McAllister,
isn't it a fact

360
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,354
that you're not
a real captain?

361
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,606
-Aye.
-(murmuring)

362
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,439
Your Honor, I would like
to show the court

363
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,605
just how much shrimp
Mr. Simpson ate.

364
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,204
Bring it in, boys.

365
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:40,118
18,000 letters all addressed
to Santa Claus.

366
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,377
You want <i>The People of</i>
<i>Springfield v. Kris Kringle.</i>

367
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,549
-That's next door.
-Oh.

368
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,841
Mrs. Simpson,
isn't it true

369
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:51,803
your husband once consumed
a ten-pound bag of flour

370
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,095
when no other food
was available?

371
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,969
-Yes, but it was--
-Your witness.

372
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,437
-Uh, there's a pizza here for--
-Right here.

373
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,149
Mrs. Simpson, what did
you and your husband do

374
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,691
after you were ejected
from the restaurant?

375
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,145
We... pretty much
went straight home.

376
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,986
Mrs. Simpson,
you're under oath.

377
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,582
We drove around
until 3:00 a.m.

378
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,998
looking for another
all-you-can-eat fish restaurant.

379
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,868
(excited murmuring)

380
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,285
And when you
couldn't find one?

381
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,713
We went fishing.

382
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,342
(sobbing)

383
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,879
Did these sound like
the actions of a man

384
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,094
who had all he could eat?

385
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,125
-Not at all!
-No!

386
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,637
That could have been me.

387
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,389
Homer,
I've a proposition for ye

388
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,222
fair and true.

389
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,807
Come on, Marge.

390
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,482
Let the people see
your pretty face.

391
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,730
Come see Bottomless Pete,

392
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,442
nature's cruelest mistake.

393
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,783
Come for the freak,

394
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,358
stay for the food.

395
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,823
WOMAN:
Oh, he's hideous.

396
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,953
MAN:
I heard they shaved a gorilla.

397
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,122
Hey, baby,
my shirt's chafing me.

398
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,241
Mind if I take it off?

399
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,788
Well... okay.

400
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,586
I got to do something.

401
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,380
Hmm.

402
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,844
But it says "Good for
one free beer at Moe's."

403
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,045
This is Moe's tavern,
isn't it?

404
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,715
No. This is Bo's Cavern.

405
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,675
Give me my beer.

406
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,265
Stupid welcome-mobile.

407
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,140
I knew it would ruin me.

408
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,437
(phone ringing)

409
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,270
Just a sec, I'll check.

410
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,315
Uh... Amanda Huggenkiss?

411
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:31,358
Hey, I'm looking
for Amanda Huggenkiss.

412
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,823
Why can't I find
Amanda Huggenkiss?

413
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,485
(loud laughter)

414
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,583
Maybe your standards
are too high.

415
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,119
You little S.O.B.!

416
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,082
If I ever find out
who you are

417
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,162
I'm gonna shove a sausage
down your throat

418
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,328
and stick starving dogs
in your butt.

419
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,836
My name is Jimbo Jones

420
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,498
and I live
at 1094 Evergreen Terrace.

421
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:54,047
Aha! Big mistake, pal!

422
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,723
I knew he'd slip up
sooner or later.

423
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,722
Ah, yes. Rusty and dull.

424
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,974
Barney, don't steal

425
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,847
any beer while I'm gone.

426
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:07,064
What kind of pathetic drunk
do you take me for?

427
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,476
(gasps)

428
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,484
Somebody spilled beer
in this ashtray.

429
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,816
-(slurping)
-Ah.

430
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,321
(grunting)

431
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,574
(maniacal laughter)

432
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,316
MOE: Let's see,
where is that map?

433
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,408
Evergreen Terrace...
There it is, F-5.

434
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,044
(maniacal laughter continues)

435
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,087
I don't believe it.

436
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,249
Now my pants
are chafing me.

437
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,507
(shouts)

438
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,219
All right.
Who's Jimbo Jones?

439
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,130
I am.

440
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:40,507
You just made your
second mistake, buddy boy.

441
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,556
Please, dude,
don't hurt me.

442
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,059
Oh, man!

443
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,391
-(crying)
-That's your outlaw?

444
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:50,107
I wasn't really going to kill ya.
I was just going to cut ya.

445
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,689
(sobbing)

446
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,194
Aw, forget it.

447
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,316
Ouch! I better
go check on Barney.

448
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,993
(slurping)

449
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,276
Uh-oh, my heart just stopped.

450
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,786
Ah! There it goes.

451
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,752
(grunting)

452
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,209
-(loud thud)
-Ow!

453
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,304
Stupid wishing well.

454
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,129
Jimbo, I don't think

455
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,755
we should see
each other anymore.

456
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,721
You're just not the guy
I thought you were.

457
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:23,761
(sniffling)
Can I have my shirt back?

458
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,227
(blows nose)

459
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,978
Well, Bart,
you were right about him.

460
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,981
As usual,
a knife-wielding maniac

461
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,363
has shown us the way.

462
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:35,149
You know, if you
were only old enough

463
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,404
to grow a bad
teenage moustache,

464
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,566
I'd go out
with you in a second.

465
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,025
Wow.

466
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:44,034
Hello. I'd like to speak
to Ms. Tinkle.

467
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,037
First name...
(whispers)

468
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,289
Ivana.

469
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,581
Ivana Tinkle.
Just a sec.

470
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,745
Ivana Tinkle?
Ivana Tinkle!

471
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,174
All right, everybody,
put down your glasses.

472
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,554
Ivana Tinkle!

473
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,590
(loud laughter)

474
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,635
Har, har, har.

475
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:02,758
