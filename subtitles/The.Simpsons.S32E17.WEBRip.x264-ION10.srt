1
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:13,614
Oh, my hallway‐walking God!

2
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:16,016
I've seen my fair share
of workplace atrocities,

3
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,552
but this one's gonna be hard
not to whistle‐blow.

4
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,454
Carlson,
how about you forget

5
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,591
any unkillable
irradiated airborne entities

6
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:25,192
you think you saw

7
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,728
and sign
this nondisclosure agreement?

8
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:31,565
I'm sorry, I have no choice
but to speak up and say...

9
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,400
What's in it for me?

10
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,803
Guess who just got
two VIP concert tickets

11
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,938
to see Bob Seger tonight!

12
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:39,473
Bob Seger!

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,475
Which Bullet Band
is he bringing?

14
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:42,743
Silver!

15
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,880
In that case,
I'm closin' shop early.

16
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:51,785
Marge, you know how nothing
ever happens to me?

17
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,822
Well, the curse has been lifted!

18
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:57,158
I love how excited you are

19
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,660
to chaperone
the kids' weekend sleepover

20
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,862
on the World War II battleship.

21
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,764
What?! Chaperoning?

22
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:06,567
You can't just spring this on me
at the last...

23
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:14,108
Aw, you've got to fill in
for me, Marge.

24
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:16,677
I'd do it for you
if you were the husband.

25
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,445
You always get to do
the fun thing

26
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,181
and leave me holding the bag.

27
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,225
I'll get you a new bag.
A tote from the merch table.

28
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,751
What size are you?

29
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:28,689
No. I'm watching the Gen Gala
red‐carpet arrivals tomorrow.

30
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,225
Can't you just record it
and watch it next week

31
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,928
when me and Lenny are
at the Hall & Oates concert?

32
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:36,463
I'm hosting the watch party.

33
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,935
I have firm commitments
from several A‐level gays.

34
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,469
We're all gonna make
snarky comments

35
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,406
about celebrities'
outrageous outfits.

36
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,943
I'm working up the courage
to use the B‐word on a man.

37
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,911
Okay, honey, I give up.

38
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:52,713
You host your party.
I go to the concert.

39
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,715
No field trip for the kids.

40
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,884
It was your decision,
so I'll let you tell them.

41
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,886
<i>Yo‐ho, yo‐ho</i>

42
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:01,589
<i>A field trip life for me</i>

43
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,364
Mommy! Mommy!

44
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:13,867
I took a bite of my juice box
because I forgot!

45
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,736
Ready about, sailors!

46
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,272
Name's Captain Bowditch.

47
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:20,608
For the next 36 hours,
you will be my crew

48
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:23,944
aboard the USS ship with a name
we're not allowed to say anymore

49
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,779
and with good reason.

50
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:28,949
Now, the year is 1943.

51
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:32,453
We sailors have fought many
battles in the Pacific theater,

52
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,389
but today we face
our most vicious enemy yet...

53
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:37,024
Oxidation.

54
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,361
Kill those lousy Oxies!

55
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:44,265
Rust has overtaken the vessel,
and I'm giving you three tools

56
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,568
to neutralize the threat,
wire brushes, marine paint,

57
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,403
and the remainder
of the weekend.

58
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:54,308
Chaperones, you will stand watch
in six‐hour shifts.

59
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,143
Now, pair up!

60
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,480
Can you imagine getting stuck
with Sarah Wiggum

61
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,748
for the whole weekend?

62
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:03,384
What's she looking for,
a personality?

63
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:09,189
So, I guess we should figure out
some system to pair up, like...

64
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,097
Hey, Sarah, we've met before.

65
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:19,233
I'm Bart's mom, Marge.

66
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,068
Hi.

67
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,441
So, overnight field trips,
the things we do for our kids.

68
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,944
Kids.

69
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,212
So...

70
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,848
have you ever been
on a battleship before?

71
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:37,818
Probably.

72
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:44,558
We're so close,
we can read the labels

73
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,894
on the drummer's medications.

74
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,562
Hey, I have that too.

75
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,799
Mild depression rules!

76
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,767
Nice seats, huh, fellas?

77
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,537
Yeah, Mr. Burns' payoffs
are always the best.

78
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,640
Luckily, I was able to get
my wife to take over chaperoning

79
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:03,377
some stupid battleship weekend
with Ralphie.

80
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,379
Hey, I saddled my wife
with that too.

81
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:07,348
Marge and Sarah
were okay with that?

82
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,083
Ah, they'll be fine.

83
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:12,019
Wives, they love
that World War II stuff.

84
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,088
Yeah, they're always gifting
their husbands

85
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:16,090
books and movies about it,

86
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:19,426
but you know they're really
buying it them for themselves.

87
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,430
And number ten would be...

88
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,900
telling a funny story.

89
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:30,270
What are your top ten ways
of starting a conversation?

90
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,839
Talking.

91
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,676
I guess we should get back
to the kids.

92
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,111
They're asleep.

93
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:38,479
What?

94
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:44,418
Almost midnight?
How did it get so late?

95
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,689
It's only 8:50?

96
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:54,962
Wait. Did you move
the clock ahead

97
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,798
to trick the kids
into going to sleep early?

98
00:04:57,865 --> 00:05:00,067
Sarah, I'm impressed.

99
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:04,738
A bottle of pocket alcohol.

100
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,743
Dang, this is the last place
on earth I want to be.

101
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,581
No offense, Marge, but, geez,
this field trip sucks!

102
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,352
You said all those words!

103
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,920
I'm just quiet.

104
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,589
Even though everyone thinks
I'm an idiot.

105
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,758
No, no, we don't think
you're an idiot.

106
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,760
We just think you're boring.

107
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,900
Did you bring this from home?

108
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:36,403
Actually, I got it from Admiral
Dingdong's liquor cabinet.

109
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,606
- It wasn't locked?
- Oh, maybe it was.

110
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,708
Wink.

111
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,512
I've never done a swig.

112
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,754
Oh, Sarah Wiggum, who are you?

113
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:57,691
I love Clancy, but you have
no idea what it's like

114
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:00,461
to be married to a man
with a dangerous job

115
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,896
he's just not good at.

116
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,131
Actually...

117
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,133
And with the way he eats,

118
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,135
each crust
he sucks the cheese out of

119
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,003
could be his last.

120
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,139
Maybe I do understand.

121
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:16,076
It just takes so much work
to be a mom and a wife

122
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:18,412
and keep the goods
in a tight little package,

123
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,880
if you catch my drift.

124
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,849
Sometimes it feels like he...

125
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,217
Takes me for granted!

126
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:26,220
Why do his last‐minute man‐plans
have to ruin

127
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:29,389
the one day of the year
where I get to be catty?

128
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,891
Hell yeah, sister.

129
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,227
Well, you know what?
You and me,

130
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:36,396
we're like two fun peas
in a party pod.

131
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,565
We should do more hangouts.

132
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:42,569
Oh, I'd like that, but there's
a reason I keep to myself.

133
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:45,839
Secret reasons.

134
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,009
Oh, no.

135
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,944
What are you doing here?

136
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,180
How did you find me?

137
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:54,381
Sarah!

138
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:55,983
Marge!

139
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,291
Please take this bag
off my head.

140
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:05,526
I think whoever you kidnapped

141
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,028
before me was a smoker.

142
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,031
Why did you bring her into it?

143
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,000
She's just
some vanilla soccer mom.

144
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,701
She doesn't know anything.

145
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,238
Hey, once I start bagging heads,
I can't stop.

146
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,141
Hey, there, Sarah.
I see you're hanging

147
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,809
with the Yankee Candle crowd.

148
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,045
Wait. You know these people?

149
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,214
Marge, meet Bette and Erin.

150
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,383
They're my old partners.

151
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,386
In a throuple?
Who are the original two?

152
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,054
Partners in crime.

153
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,323
You're a criminal?

154
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,225
Jeebus Crackers!

155
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,395
Hi, Mr. Seger.

156
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,030
Boy, you probably
don't remember this,

157
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,898
but I saw you
at an airport once,

158
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,234
and I was too nervous
to say anything,

159
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,202
and then it wasn't you.

160
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,238
We love you, man!
We promised our wives

161
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,674
we'd go on some
dumb school field trip,

162
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,144
but when we got these tickets,
we ditched them so fast.

163
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,815
You broke a promise
to your wives?

164
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:04,685
A good husband's supposed to be,
Like a Rock.

165
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,220
Because we're all running
Against the Wind.

166
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,222
Terrible Night Moves.

167
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,490
Look at this.

168
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,059
Those aren't tour dates.

169
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,228
They're all the times I've
kept commitments to my wife.

170
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:18,865
Rock and Roll Never Forgets

171
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,868
the needs
of his coequal life companion.

172
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,171
You sicken me.

173
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,040
Were... Were we
just Seger‐shamed?

174
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,543
Why, the real silver bullet
is truth.

175
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,378
We're terrible husbands.

176
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:34,014
I never should have left Marge
holding the bag.

177
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:36,717
We've got to go make it up
to Bob Seger.

178
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,919
And our wives.

179
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,089
Sarah, you were a crook?

180
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,358
Everything I never knew
or cared to wonder about you

181
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:46,360
has been a lie.

182
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:49,062
We weren't crooks.
We were thieves.

183
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,400
Sexy, girlie thieves.

184
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,739
They never saw us coming,

185
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,841
but they loved
to watch us walk away.

186
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,310
There's nothing
we wouldn't lift.

187
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,711
Wallets. Watches.

188
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:08,015
MP3 players that held
over a hundred songs.

189
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,850
Man, it was a blast.

190
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:14,521
Our biggest jobs were brought
to us by a gal named Red.

191
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:18,125
She got a line
on some unsupervised diamonds

192
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,460
in a penthouse safe.

193
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,963
I was the driver,
and as always...

194
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,365
the honeypot.

195
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,473
Hey there, blue boy.

196
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,043
I was walking
past your big building

197
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,178
and seemed
to have sprained my ankle

198
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,247
because of my high flops.

199
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,882
Do you happen to have...

200
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,884
- What, a girlfriend?
- An icepack?

201
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,420
I'm sorry. I'm s...

202
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,921
Of course, of course I do.

203
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,323
This is just my night job,
by the way.

204
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,226
I'm putting myself through
the police academy. Yeah.

205
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:56,263
- Isn't that free?
- Well, the first time, yeah.

206
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,366
I love a man
in a rented uniform.

207
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:09,910
The kiss was part of the plan.

208
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,846
But falling
head over high flops wasn't.

209
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,848
Clancy...

210
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,886
- Oh, no.
- No, no, don't leave.

211
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,255
Come back to pile.

212
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,757
I gotta go, blue boy.

213
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:26,226
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, no problem.

214
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,262
- Oh, will you marry me?
- Probably!

215
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:32,432
I was supposed to be
the getaway driver.

216
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,367
My best friends were arrested.

217
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,103
And it was all my fault.

218
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,105
Oh, cool your jets.

219
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,773
Yeah, hot jets.

220
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,309
It wasn't your fault
we got busted.

221
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,611
We were set up...

222
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,379
by Red.

223
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,487
She got away
with our whole take,

224
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,589
including the Hourglass Diamond.

225
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,125
That backstabbing sack of Spanx.

226
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:01,061
Wait, so it wasn't my fault
you got caught.

227
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:04,731
Yeah, and if you hadn't gone all
horndog on that rent‐a‐cop,

228
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,433
you'd have been locked up too.

229
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,868
We found Red.

230
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:10,537
She goes by the name
Lindsey Naegle now.

231
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:12,405
I've heard of her.

232
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,742
She works in various female
executive positions around town.

233
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:18,912
We've got a plan to steal
that diamond back from her,

234
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,014
and you're gonna help us.

235
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,383
No, I left that life behind me.

236
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,918
I have a husband now,

237
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,921
and a son who's smart in a way
we haven't figured out yet.

238
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:31,358
Well, it'd be a real shame
if the Chief of Police

239
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,693
found out his wife was
a common criminal.

240
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,096
You never told Clancy?

241
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:38,098
Let's just say
he's always been better

242
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,400
at planting evidence
than finding it.

243
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:43,603
Why don't I just call him now
and tell him everything?

244
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,506
I'm in.

245
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,443
Our wives are missing?

246
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,145
Not unheard of.

247
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,481
Most women have such
an idealized version

248
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,750
of the Second World War
in their heads

249
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,819
that when they meet
the cold, hard reality,

250
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,153
they can't face it.

251
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,688
Did you see what happened?

252
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,690
There was but one witness.

253
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:07,093
Junior Seaman Ralph,
give your account of the watch.

254
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,264
The mommies got new face hats,
then got into a slidey‐door car.

255
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,200
Don't worry, I speak Ralph.

256
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,902
Face hats?
Slidey‐door?

257
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,737
God, they were kidnapped!

258
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:21,074
And there's only one man
bold enough

259
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,844
to kidnap the wives
of the chief of police

260
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,112
and his slightly slimmer
acquaintance.

261
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,948
Sarah was kidnapped?

262
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,951
Oh, spare me the act.
We know it was you.

263
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,086
I spare, I swear.

264
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:35,755
I need your family
to be happy and healthy,

265
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:38,725
because who else would I say
it would be a shame

266
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:41,361
if something were to happen to?

267
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,197
Okay, but what about
one of your cronies?

268
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,900
I assure you,
you are a beloved figure

269
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,102
amongst my business brethren.

270
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:55,141
You look a lot like
that guy Chief Bungles.

271
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,511
But there's no other reason
to kidnap Sarah.

272
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,380
She's just
my little schmoop‐a‐doop,

273
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,282
and that's all there is to her.

274
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,951
Apparently not.

275
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,453
Perhaps your wives
were not kidnapped.

276
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,124
Perhaps they left
because you are selfish men.

277
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,393
That's the only explanation.

278
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,129
It was all about us.

279
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,131
All right, what's the job?

280
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,267
Naegle sold the jewels
she ripped off from us

281
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,303
and became a fancy socialite.

282
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:24,847
She kept the biggest rock
for herself.

283
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:28,508
The Hourglass Diamond,
it's in her tiara.

284
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,078
And we're gonna steal it back

285
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,747
when she wears it
to the Gen Gala, tomorrow.

286
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,518
You're gonna rob the Gen Gala?

287
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,688
Sorry, sorry. Scheme away.

288
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,024
Okay,
here's how it's gonna work.

289
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:47,660
First, we come up
through this manhole.

290
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:48,961
Nope!

291
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,463
Excuse you?

292
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,832
Look, I may not know anything
about heists,

293
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:56,669
but I am the world's biggest
superfan of the Gen Gala,

294
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,304
and your plan won't work.

295
00:13:58,371 --> 00:13:59,305
And why not?

296
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,441
If you did any research,

297
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,910
you'd know Beyoncé's
going to be carried in

298
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,412
by 20 plus‐size gladiators,

299
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,448
who will form a human pyramid

300
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,316
right on top of your way in.

301
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:11,584
No heist.

302
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:12,952
If you're so Kmart smart,

303
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,454
how would you get in?

304
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,623
Well, these entrances
will be blocked by fans,

305
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,792
press and authorized stalkers.

306
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,962
The best plan would be
to put on a crazy dress

307
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,098
and sneak in
through the red carpet.

308
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:28,234
Although, you wouldn't get
far without a publicist

309
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,169
who knows everything
about the gala.

310
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,606
- Someone like you?
- Yeah.

311
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:37,110
This vanilla soccer mom
could be our secret weapon.

312
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,112
Me? Join the robbery?

313
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,980
No way!

314
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,117
Stealing is one of
the big thou shalt nots.

315
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,651
It's not about the cash.

316
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,286
It's about setting things right.

317
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,490
Lindsey Naegle betrayed us
for money and fame,

318
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,860
and all we got
are bad prison tattoos.

319
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,095
Aw, duckies!

320
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,830
Marge, aren't you tired

321
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,099
of being underestimated
and overlooked?

322
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,968
Together, we can right a wrong

323
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,103
and look damn good doing it.

324
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,606
I've always wanted
to say this...

325
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,075
I'm in.

326
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:16,751
This is Kent Brockman outside

327
00:15:16,885 --> 00:15:19,995
the Museum of Generational
Wealth for the annual Gen Gala.

328
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,454
This year's theme is
The Audacity.

329
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,956
A bold contrast to
last year's theme...

330
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,458
The Nerve.

331
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,093
But I'm stuck out here,

332
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,662
where hundreds of nobodies
have gathered to watch

333
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,732
dozens of somebodies
walk up some stairs.

334
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,467
Should we do this without Marge?

335
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,803
This is her favorite
watching‐party of the year.

336
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,274
Forget her.
I'm jonesing for snark.

337
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,684
Oh, God, would you look
at that dress.

338
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,478
Who is the designer,
the Great Pacific Garbage Patch?

339
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:48,247
Probably?

340
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,850
Ah, that's the good shade.

341
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:55,154
The plan's working.
We look amazing.

342
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,423
Now, let's get those tickets.

343
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,410
The 55 stairs.

344
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,246
The Tanqueray
stiletto sharpener.

345
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,815
The Swarovski crystal
wheelchair ramp.

346
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,717
Stop gawking.

347
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,452
Where do we let
the other girls in?

348
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,255
Right over there, next to...
Oh, my God!

349
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,957
Rihanna!

350
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:34,494
I listen to the clean versions
of all your songs!

351
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:40,333
Now, let's see if there's
any honey left in this pot.

352
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,904
Excuse me, I seemed
to have a pulled a muscle.

353
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:48,140
Do you have an ice pack
so that my leg can stop...

354
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,243
quivering?

355
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,777
Right away, ma'am.

356
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,313
Oh‐ho, hot stuff.

357
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,692
No sign of our wives.

358
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,761
We checked out all their
favorite places,

359
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:11,130
but turns out
we don't pay enough attention

360
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,431
to know what those are.

361
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,200
So I don't know what we did.

362
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:17,270
It was my distinct pleasure
to watch your son.

363
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,605
I find we are quite simpatico.

364
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:23,175
Both of us know nothin'
about nothin'.

365
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,047
Now that's a fluid gender!

366
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:31,817
I wouldn't mind asking them
their preferred pronouns.

367
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,453
If I'm not mistaken,

368
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,790
that's how Marge looks
when she's happy.

369
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,292
And that's my Sarah!

370
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,793
Come on, Homer.

371
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,230
It looks like this
town's got a museum.

372
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,638
There's Lindsey,
and she's wearing the tiara.

373
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,178
Okay, don't be nervous.

374
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,547
- You can do this.
- Nervous?

375
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:04,684
This is the best field trip
of my fricking life!

376
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:09,255
Ms. Naegle,
can I just say, that dress.

377
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:12,258
I know, right?
You go, girl.

378
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,393
What setting would you even
wash that on?

379
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,295
Delicate? Eco‐warm?

380
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:19,465
I bet it would make so much
noise in the dryer, right?

381
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,803
I don't want this
to sound harsh,

382
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,405
but you're not famous,
so you don't exist.

383
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,473
Bye now.

384
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,209
Darling,
stop talking to that empty chair

385
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,145
and come take a selfie
at the Fenty lip gloss fountain.

386
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,153
Oh, it's a fake!

387
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,123
I've been robbed!

388
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,993
Somebody stop
those two nobodies!

389
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,127
Keep it cool.

390
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,338
We just have to slip out of here

391
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:50,796
without anyone noticing us.

392
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,535
Sarah Wiggum, freeze!

393
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:01,340
We're here to give you ladies
the attention you deserve!

394
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,751
Now is not the time, Clancy.

395
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,919
No, no, when it comes to love,

396
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,389
it's always the time
for shouting!

397
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,391
Sar‐ah Wig‐gum!

398
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,426
Schmoop‐a‐doop!

399
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,429
Shmoop‐ba‐da‐doopa!

400
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,098
- I love Sa...
- Shut up!

401
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,034
Oh, God, ow.

402
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:33,937
- Sarah Wiggum, who are you?
- That's her! She's the thief!

403
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,389
Babe, who is she?

404
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,258
This is my new girlfriend.

405
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,794
You were tumbling
for a long time.

406
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,562
Oh, you poor thing.

407
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,497
Here's your bag, sweetie.

408
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,133
Those aren't mine!

409
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,002
- My earrings!
- My blood diamond!

410
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,804
My conflict tennis bracelet!

411
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:14,613
Oh, this time,
leave me holding the bag.

412
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,481
Aw, thanks, Homie.

413
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,817
But they're part of
the ensemble.

414
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,523
Chalamet looks like dirt.

415
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,825
BTS looks like seven dirts.

416
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,595
I see nerve there
but nothing audacious.

417
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,698
Oh. My. God.

418
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,199
Jeebus Crackers!

419
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,500
That's Marge!

420
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:39,304
What the hell is she doing
at the Gen Gala?

421
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,440
Exactly.
She looks like dirt.

422
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,977
It's what she would have wanted.

423
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,691
Oh, Clancy.

424
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,328
So, this whole time, I've been
married to a master criminal.

425
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,297
Damn straight.

426
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,136
Wait, wait, uh, where's Ralph?

427
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,473
I must confess,

428
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,275
I thought putting
crushed‐up Oreos

429
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,977
into the cookies and cream
yogurt would be redundant.

430
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,681
Instead, it is transcendent.

431
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,751
I like to smoosh
the gummy bears.

432
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,352
Hey, no touching!

433
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:32,291
If the boy wants to smoosh,
the boy will smoosh.

434
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,459
I love you, scary daddy.

435
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:38,563
I love you too,
Ralphie Stickie Hands.
