(SOBBING) Ow!

337
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,887
I just don't understand
what the problem is.

(GIGGLING)

339
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,051
Okay, that's two,
and that's it.

340
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,566
If I think of another one,
I'll let him back in.

344
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,450
Stupid, selfish Bart.

345
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,331
Like he's ever going to do
another nice thing for me.

LISA: He's building a me.

349
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,889
Well, I mean, it's a little
American-primitive,

350
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,247
but who am I to
dismiss outsider art?

351
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,483
It shows he misses me,
and this is the third thing.

(LISA PANTING)

353
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,442
Lise, just let me be.

354
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,404
Look in your heart.
I'm begging you,
look in your heart.

355
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,165
Bart, don't worry.
I'm relinquishing
the poke pole.

356
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,566
What does that mean,
you're sharpening it?

357
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,041
Look in your heart.
I'm begging you.
Look in your heart.

358
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,525
I'm not sharpening it.

359
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,886
Are you putting
feces on the tip?

360
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,849
No, I'm giving it up.

361
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,369
I've realized
how much I missed you,

362
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,162
and I can see from this
magnificent Lisa statue
that you felt the same way.

363
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,042
Oh, uh... Yeah.

364
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,441
When you're right,
you're right. Let's eat.

365
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,729
Yo, Bart,
we're ready to torch the
Wicker Witch of the West.

366
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,406
Jimbo, the real one's here.

367
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,610
Oh, man. This is every
effigist's worst nightmare.

368
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,363
Bart, you were going to burn
the third nice thing
you've ever done for me?

369
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:24,925
Well, you see,
the fire represents
your musical ability.

370
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,562
Oh, Bart, I missed your lies.

371
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,166
And I was kind
of a pill, I guess.

372
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,086
Lisa, you just
poked my feelings.
I'm sorry, too.

373
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,724
Give me that torch.
