have heard the rumors

88
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,492
that a batch of Duff
was contaminated

89
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,528
with strychnine.

90
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,071

Strychnine?

91
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,074

92
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,485
Are you sure?

93
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,123
Well, everyone's
talking about it.

94
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,910
It was even on CNN
last night.

95
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:46,914
CNN?

96
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,535
Oh...

97
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,961
Well, it's not true.
Let's go!

98
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,214
Now here's one of our favorite
Duff Beer commercials

99
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,667
from the early 1950s.

100
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:03,927
<i>Only Duff fills your Q-zone</i>
<i>with pure beer goodness.</i>

102
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:07,933
<i>and up...</i>

103
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:08,886
<i>and up.</i>

<i>"Amos 'n' Andy."</i>

00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,534
We're proud of all
of our Duff commercials,

107
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:21,949
but here's a very special
one from 1960.

108
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,490
<i>Well, I would suggest,</i>
<i>Mr. Vanocur,</i>

109
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,284
<i>that if you knew</i>
<i>the president,</i>

110
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,157
<i>that that was probably</i>
<i>just a facetious remark.</i>

111
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:32,075
<i>ANNOUNCER: And now</i>
<i>a word from our sponsor.</i>

112
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,995
<i>I would like to take</i>
<i>this opportunity</i>

113
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,713
<i>to express my fondness</i>
<i>for Duff Beer.</i>

114
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,384
<i>(crowd cheering)</i>

115
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,554
<i>I'd also like</i>
<i>to express my fondness</i>

116
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,182
<i>for that particular beer.</i>

117
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,259
<i>(crowd murmuring)</i>

118
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,505
The man never drank
a Duff in his life.

119
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,725
And here we have Duff,
Duff Lite,

120
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,138
and our newest flavor,
Duff Dry.

121
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,316
What does the future
hold for Duff?

122
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,318
Let's just say we've got
a few ideas up our sleeve.

123
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,451
-Like what?
-Um...

124
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,858
I'd rather not
get into it right now.

125
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,196
-Why not?
-All right,

126
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,821
we don't have any ideas
for the future.

127
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,038
-We got nothing. Happy?
-No.

128
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,998
(sobbing)

129
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,499
Mom, Bart wrecked
my project

130
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,131
and the science fair's
in three days.

131
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,749
Hmm.

132
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,875
Well, I've got an idea.

133
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:20,962
Why don't you
run a hamster

134
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,507
through a maze?

135
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,095
Help me.
Help me!

136
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,929
(evil chuckle)

137
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,224
What's so funny?

138
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,727
Oh... uh...
I was just thinking

139
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,350
of a joke I saw on "Herman's Head".
(insincere chuckle)

140
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,857
Mmm.

141
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,439
Now this is the most
important man on the tour.

142
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,025
He's in charge
of quality control.

143
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,661
{\an8}Fine. Fine. Mouse. Fine.

144
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,618
{\an8}Mouse. Rat. Fine.
Syringe. Fine.

145
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,029
{\an8}Nose. Fine.

146
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,158
Let me just say, you're doing
a great job, Phil.

147
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,406
{\an8}Hey, thanks a lot.

148
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,747
{\an8}That makes it all worthwhile.

149
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,422
HOMER: Mmm...

150
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,090
Gummi beer.

151
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,129
Hey, Barney, I think
you've had enough.

152
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,594
Are you crazy?

153
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,224
We still haven't tried
Raspberry Duff,

154
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,471
Lady Duff,
Tartar Control Duff...

155
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,345
(groans)

156
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:18,942
Barney, give me your keys.

157
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,361
You're too drunk
to drive.

158
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,610
I'm fine.

159
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:25,361
Okay. You leave me
no option.

160
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,235
Ow! What was that for?

161
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,241
I'm trying
to knock you out!

162
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,453
Ow!

163
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,703
Cut it out!

164
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,453
Ow!

165

00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,912
Give him the breathalyzer!

182
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,872
Huh?

183
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:14,991
(buzzes)

184
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,117
-You're under arrest.
-D'oh!

185
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,921
Think you can
get this car home?

186
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,959
Sure thing, giant beer.

187
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,340
Ooh! Ow!

188
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,631
Ow! Mother of mercy!

189
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,085
(laughing)

190
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,255
Hey, this is kind of fun.

191
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,144
Whee! (laughs)

192
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,181
Whee! Ow!

193
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,345
(phone ringing)

194
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,765
Hello?

195
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,403
Yeah, Mrs. Simpson
I have some bad news.

196
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,691
Your husband was found D.O.A.

197
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,395
Oh, my god!
He's dead?!

198
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,025
Oh, wait! I mean D.W.I.

199
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,151
(chuckles)

200
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,658
I always get
those two mixed up.

201
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,370
My name's Mrs. Phillips.

202
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,950
You said my husband
is D.W.I.?

203
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,576
Uh...

204
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,333
Why don't you talk
to that officer over there?

205
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,455
I'm going out to lunch.

206
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,753
Don't worry, Homer.

207
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,705
I have a foolproof strategy

208
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,706
to get you out of here.

209
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,797
Surprise witnesses--

210
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,632
Each more surprising
than the last.

211
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,547
I tell you, the judge
won't know what hit him.

212
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,887
-Ow!
-Pipe down in there, Hutz.

213
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,934
Your license
is hereby revoked,

214
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,517
and you are to attend
traffic school,

215
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,652
and two months
of alch-anon meetings.

216
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,479
Your honor,
I'd like that last remark

217
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,355
-stricken from the record.
-No.

218
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,776
It doesn't get
any better than this.

219
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:36,123
I want the most
intelligent hamster you've got.

220
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,370
Okay.

221
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,791
Uh...

222
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,579
This little guy
writes mysteries

223
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,753
under the name
of J.D. MacGregor.

224
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,752
How can a hamster
write mysteries?

225
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,004
Well, he gets the ending first
then he works backward.

226
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,167
Aw, come on.

227
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,585
Look, kid, just take him

228
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,843
before his mother eats him,
all right?

229
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,554
Have a good day
at work, honey.

230
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,018
Ha-ha!

231
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
Stupid bicycle.

232
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,274
Can't believe this.

233
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,732
No good, rotten...

234
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,732
(bell rings)

235
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,233
(chuckles)

236
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,185
I guess it's not all bad.

237
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,145
<i>"I propose to determine</i>
<i>the answer to the question:</i>

238
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,236
<i>Is my brother dumber</i>
<i>than a hamster?"</i>

239
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,073
Hey, Lis.
Look what I can do.

240
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,658
(muffled grunts)

241
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,664
Doggone it.

242
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,303
(gasps)

243
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,804
Remarkable!

244
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,643
Stupid books.

245
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,023
Hey, a cupcake.

246
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,639
(grunting)

247
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,560
Mm-hmm.

248
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,517
Dah!

249
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,569
Hamster: One...

250
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,863
Bart: Zero.

251
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,696
Experiment two.

252
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,662
The food is connected to a mild
electrical current.

253
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,081
The hamster has learned
a valuable lesson--

254
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,214
"Beware the hand of man."

255
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,999
(whistling)

256
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,130
Oh, a wise guy, eh?

257
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,720
(grunts like Curly)

258
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:19,933
Ow.

259
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:20,972
Ow.

260
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:21,885
Ow.

261
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:22,852
(snickers)

262
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:27,442
Hamster: Two, Bart: Zero.

263
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,730
Now, if any of you ever think
of drinking and driving again,

264
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,236
this film will scare
the pants off of you.

265
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,236
(screams)

266
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,572
Guys, guys,
this is the wrong movie.

267
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,328
Oh, wait a second.

268
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,620
I do something
really funny here.

269
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,959
(laughing)

270
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:52,924
(sighs)

271
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,723
<i>What a terrible waste.</i>

272
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,104
<i>Hi. I'm actor Troy McClure.</i>

273
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,731
<i>You might remember me</i>
<i>from such driver's ed films as</i>

274
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,189
<i>"Alice's Adventures</i>
<i>Through the Windshield Glass</i>

275
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,900
<i>and "The Decapitation</i>
<i>of Larry Leadfoot."</i>

276
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,691
<i>For the next 60 minutes,</i>

277
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:17,404
<i>we'll be seeing actual film</i>
<i>of car crash victims.</i>

278
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,276
<i>(wacky comedy music playing)</i>

279
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,073
<i>(tires screeching)</i>

280
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,617

281
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,871

283
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,795
<i>(crashing)</i>

284
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,511
TROY:
<i>Here's an appealing fellow.</i>

285
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,221
<i>In fact, they're a-peeling</i>
<i>him off the sidewalk.</i>

286
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,682
(laughing)

287
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,222
It's funny
'cause I don't know him.

288
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,056
I'm here for
the alch-anon meeting.

289
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,853
Mm-hmm. Third door
on your left.

290
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,646
Coping with senility?

291
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,360
No. I'm here
for microwave cookery.

292
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,901
No, wait.

293
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,364
Coping with senility.

294
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,280
My name is Ned.

295
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,824
-Hello, Ned.
-Hello, Ned.

296
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,118
It's been 4,000 days
since my last drink.

297
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,503
It was my first
and last blackberry schnapps.

298
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,839
Ned, did you clip
Ann Landers today?

299
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,340
Ann Landers
is a boring old biddy.

300
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,552
(gasps) Ned!

301
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,796
I was more animal than man.

302
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,756
My name is Otto.

303
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,176
I love to get blotto.

304
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,555
My name is Hans.

305
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,773
Drinking has ruined my life.

306
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,823
I'm 31 years old.

307
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,478
My name is Homer,

308
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,396
and I'm just here because
the court made me come.

309
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,645
Homer, with our help,

310
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,196
you'll never
touch a beer again.

311
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,450
(screaming)

312
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,620
So they say
I might have a problem.

313
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,825
(snorts)

314
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,625
Homie, do you ever
drink alone?

315
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,379
Does the Lord
count as a person?

316
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,551
No.

317
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,049
Then yes.

318
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,220
Do you need a beer
to fall asleep?

319
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,549
Thank you.
That would be nice.

320
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,104
Do you ever hide beer
around the house?

321
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,048
Do I ever.

322
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,021
Ah!

323
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,849
Do you ever drink
to escape from reality?

324
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:18,316
(humming "The Cancan")

325
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,702
Homie, I'd like you
to do something for me.

326
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,148
You name it.

327
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,198
I want you to give up
beer for a month.

328
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,282
You got it.
No deer for a month.

329
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,827
Did you say "beer"
or "deer"?

330
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,792
Deer.

331
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,673
Please, Homie.

332
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,379
I know you can do this.

333
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,750
All right.

334
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,047
Starting tomorrow,
no beer for a month.

335
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,546
(pop-top can opens)

336
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,014
MARGE:
What was that noise?

337
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,974
HOMER: I was saying,
"Psst, I love you."

338
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,926
Bart, could you go
get the cupcakes?

339
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,478
Cupcakes, cupcakes!

340
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,941
Yes, sweet cakes for all.

341
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,566
(shivering)

342
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,793
Well, beer,
we've had some great times.

343
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,709

(sniffles)

350
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:45,782
Huh?

351
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,784
She'll pay for this.

352
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,075
I'm going to crush
her like this pellet.

353
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,079
Ow!

354
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,080
Ow!

355
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,081
Ow!

356
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,082
Ow!

357
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,043
Ow!

358
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,785
(gasps)

359
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,963
BART: Looking for something?

360
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,625
What have you done
with my report?

361
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,513
I've hidden it.

362
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,550
To find it, you'll need
to decipher a series of clues,

363
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,764
-each more fiendish than--
-Got it.

364
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:10,723
D'oh!

365
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:16,516
Behold gravity
in all its glory.

366
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,519
Pretty lame, Milhouse.

367
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,266
Can I touch it?

368
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,648
I've worked
too long and hard on this

369
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,904
for you to screw it up now.

370
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,646
But it's got
my name on it.

371
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,157
Just stand over there.

372
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,240
Over there!

373
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,284
Behold the flying machine

374
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,788
that will carry me,
Phileas Fogg,

375
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,370
{\an8}around the world
in 80 days.

376
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,761
{\an8}Dang! I was aiming
for his head.

377
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,799
<i>Don't think about beer.</i>

378
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,723
Mmm, alcohol-fueled car.

379
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,306
One for you.
One for me.

380
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,062
One for you. One for me.

381
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,395
(groans)

382
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,150
{\an8}I don't know if I like you
experimenting on your brother.

383
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,744
Please, Mother,

384
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,699
it's purely in
the interest of science.

385
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,660
{\an8}<i>That'll learn him</i>
<i>to bust my tomater.</i>

386
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,041
(crowd cheering)

387
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,250
(gasps)

388
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,079
BART: Step right up, folks.

389
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,575
We'll answer the question

390
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,996
that has been plaguing
scientists for ages--

391
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,335
Can hamsters fly planes?

392
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,921
(crowd murmuring)

393
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,926
MAN: Oh, look he's got
miniature goggles on.

394
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,179
Oh! And a little scarf.

395
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,760
-Isn't that adorable?
-Oh-ho!

396
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:39,056
But this project
has no scientific merit.

397
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,271
Take a hike, sister.

398
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,690
Oh, missy,
sour grapes.

399
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,269
Lisa, every good scientist
is half B.F. Skinner

400
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,324
and half P.T. Barnum.

401
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,228
I don't think I need to see
the other exhibits.

402
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,857
First prize.

403
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,243
(crowd applauds)

404
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,239
(sighs)

405
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,244
One down.

406
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,325
29 to go.

407
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,250
<i>WOMEN:</i>
<i>Down with sexism!</i>

408
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,959
<i>Down with sexism!</i>

409
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,921
<i>Look at all</i>
<i>those feminists.</i>

410
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,751
<i>You thinking</i>
<i>what I'm thinking?</i>

411
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:12,303

412
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,972
<i>(women laughing)</i>

413
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:14,971
<i>-Yeah!</i>
<i>-Yeah!</i>

414
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,552
<i>All right!</i>

415
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:22,309
TV, have you
turned on me too?

416
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:26,152
(organ plays)

417
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,230
<i>ANNOUNCER: The windup</i>
<i>and the two-two pitch...</i>

418
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,815
<i>Oh, no, sir!</i>
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

419
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,690
<i>The batter</i>
<i>is calling for time.</i>

420
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,568

421
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,736

<i>beach ball on the field.</i>

422
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,406
<i>And the ball boys</i>
<i>are discussing</i>

423
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,794

424
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:46,501
<i>I never realized</i>

425
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,382
I think I've lost weight.

426
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,092
You've never
looked better.

427
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,585
Thank you all for coming.

428
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,797
We've got some very
interesting developments

429
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,807
in the field
of supperware.

430
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:01,929
Uh-huh.

431
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,975
This is the 128-ounce tub.

432
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,940
You can fit your whole
head in it.

433
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,234
Don't be scared, Jubjub.

434
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,067
It's mama.

435
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,033
I would kill everyone
in this room

436
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,743
for a drop of sweet beer.

437
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,204
So, Homer, please feel
free to tell us anything.

438
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,996
There's no judgment here.

439
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,079
The other day I was
so desperate for a beer

440
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,746
I snuck
into the football stadium

441
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,174
and ate the dirt
under the bleachers.

442
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,212
-(gasping)
-I cast thee out!

443
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,337
Don't think about beer.

444
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,473
Don't think about beer.

445
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,339
Don't think about beer.

446
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,386
Ah!

447
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,101
Ah!

448
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,810
(train whistle blowing)

449
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,734
TRAIN: Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug,
chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug,

450
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,651
chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug,
chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug.

451
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,230
(screams)

452
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,999
No!

453
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,286
30 days.

454
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,044
I'm proud of you,
Homie.

455
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,456
Marge, I'm going to Moe's.

456
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,844
Send the kids to the neighbors

457
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,131
I'm coming back loaded.

458
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,336
Mmm... you don't have to
start drinking right away.

459
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,677
I was thinking we could
go for a bike ride.

460
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,643
But Marge, the barflies
are expecting me.

461
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,604
Moe and Barney and that guy
who calls me Bill.

462
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,186
But you look better.

463
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,361
You don't sweat
while you eat anymore,

464
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,280
and look, you've saved
more than $100.

465
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,860
I found it in your pants.

466
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,275
Yoink!

467
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,493
Mmm.

468
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,872
-(panting)
-Well, well,

469
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,371
look who it is?

470
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:48,332
Mr. I-don't-need-alcohol-
to-enjoy-life.

471
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,123
We hate him, right, fellas?

472
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,247
(muttering)

473
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,254
Moe, give me a beer.

474
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,586
Hey, everybody,
Homer's back!

475
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,262
(muttering)

476
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,060
(burps)

477
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,694
Come on, Homer,
do it for your old pal, Moesy.

478
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:16,071
But, Moe, yesterday you called
Homer a worthless sack of--

479
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,939
Pipe down,
Rub-a-dub!

480
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:18,816
Ow.

481
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,028
Put it in the fridge,
Moe.

482
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,945
I've got a date
with my wife.

483
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,661
You'll be back!

484
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,374
And so will you,

485
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,374
and you,

486
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,865
and you.

487
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,498
Of course, I'll be back.

488
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,464
If you didn't close,
I'd never leave.
