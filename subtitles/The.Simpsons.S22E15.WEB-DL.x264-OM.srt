1
00:00:10,622 --> 00:00:11,389
Ah!

2
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:48,759
D'oh!

3
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:30,184
Meep, meep.

4
00:01:34,472 --> 00:01:36,157
Meep, meep.

5
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:40,044
<i>Hey, this was one of the
planets on Star Trek.</i>

6
00:01:40,112 --> 00:01:43,181
It's so hot I want
to wedgie the sun.

7
00:01:43,248 --> 00:01:45,216
I wet my arm-pants.

8
00:01:45,284 --> 00:01:48,186
Children, I hope we all have
a pleasant and orderly day

9
00:01:48,253 --> 00:01:50,121
here at "Satan's Anvil."

10
00:01:50,172 --> 00:01:52,206
No one knows why the early
settlers called it that,

11
00:01:52,274 --> 00:01:53,791
and I suppose we never will.

12
00:01:53,842 --> 00:01:56,027
Now remember to stay
hydrated, and...

13
00:01:56,094 --> 00:01:57,812
Rattlesnake!

14
00:01:59,664 --> 00:02:02,133
Ha! You fall for that
every year, Seymour.

15
00:02:02,184 --> 00:02:05,102
And the one year I didn't, I was
bitten by an actual rattlesnake.

16
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,055
Yes, if I recall, you took
a sick day you did not have.

17
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,740
I was going to lose my foot.

18
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:12,109
Of which you have two.
Mm...

19
00:02:12,177 --> 00:02:13,477
Ah!

20
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:20,017
Greetings, desert dwellers.

21
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:21,302
Git out.

22
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,905
The second we let one
trespasser on our land,

23
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:25,723
then every goldang...

24
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,275
Aw, for crying out loud,

25
00:02:27,342 --> 00:02:29,327
It's like Grand Central Station
around here.

26
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:30,895
Now, Delbert, be nice.

27
00:02:30,963 --> 00:02:32,079
He's just a boy.

28
00:02:32,164 --> 00:02:34,699
Oh, sure, first they send a boy,

29
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:35,933
then a prairie dog,

30
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:37,902
then they send in them
black helicopters.

31
00:02:46,194 --> 00:02:48,729
Sir, you have won a National
Endowment For The Arts grant

32
00:02:48,797 --> 00:02:50,197
for your scrap-metal sculptures.

33
00:02:50,265 --> 00:02:53,150
You'll have to put that check
in my cold dead hands.

34
00:02:56,772 --> 00:02:58,072
Hmm.

35
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:03,077
This park's environment
has been preserved

36
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:07,014
free of invasive species,
except for one... rock climbers.

37
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:11,502
Uh, my jaw is not a toe-hold.

38
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,987
But if I reach your summit,

39
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:14,822
I'll have climbed rangers
on seven continents.

40
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,007
Fine.

41
00:03:19,978 --> 00:03:21,879
Oh, I sprained my ankle!

42
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,631
I'm gonna die up here.

43
00:03:23,715 --> 00:03:26,233
Hang on, I'm coming up for you.

44
00:03:26,301 --> 00:03:28,586
Hurry before it gets dark.

45
00:03:28,654 --> 00:03:31,422
This next move is tricky. Yeah.

46
00:03:36,228 --> 00:03:38,312
Oh, my God.

47
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,881
The legends are true.

48
00:03:39,948 --> 00:03:41,833
Did you find gold?

49
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,669
Better... the prospectors
left naughty French postcards.

50
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:47,421
Whoa, mama!

51
00:03:47,473 --> 00:03:49,623
Bart, this is fool's porn.

52
00:03:49,675 --> 00:03:51,676
I'll take it off your hands.

53
00:03:51,743 --> 00:03:53,161
<i>C'est si bon.</i>

54
00:03:53,228 --> 00:03:55,396
<i>Si bon. Si bon.</i>

55
00:03:55,464 --> 00:03:57,815
And... remorse.

56
00:04:22,758 --> 00:04:27,094
"While beautiful, the desert
also harbors hidden dangers:

57
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:30,364
"cacti, poisonous snakes,
and most deadly of all...

58
00:04:30,432 --> 00:04:32,800
Scorpions!"

59
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,843
They calm down when they're near
the Springfield Silvertongues.

60
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:45,062
Hmm.

61
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,231
Now they're aggressive again.

62
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:48,733
I'm sure there's a correlation,

63
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,086
but could there be a...
causation?!

64
00:04:57,809 --> 00:05:01,395
These flowers saved me
from a terrible fate...

65
00:05:01,463 --> 00:05:03,548
not getting an "A" on
my next science project.

66
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,517
Lisa, we have to go.

67
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:08,703
Milhouse found a hippie
skeleton and he's freaking out.

68
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,738
Never get off the bus!

69
00:05:10,806 --> 00:05:12,440
Never get off the bus!

70
00:05:15,594 --> 00:05:18,963
Check it out! Something
pathetic's going on.

71
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:21,532
You can't throw me out!
I'm not dead yet!

72
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,967
That's the deal, man!

73
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:25,536
I'm sorry, Abe,
but you're just too cranky.

74
00:05:25,604 --> 00:05:28,189
I got a right to be cranky.

75
00:05:28,257 --> 00:05:31,158
The food stinks and the TV's
only got one channel.

76
00:05:31,226 --> 00:05:32,610
That's a fish tank.

77
00:05:32,694 --> 00:05:34,011
You're a fish tank.

78
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,013
That is so hurtful.

79
00:05:36,081 --> 00:05:38,783
I wish I was a fish tank.

80
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,218
Then I could filter
out his nasty words.

81
00:05:41,286 --> 00:05:43,271
Call me a fish tank...

82
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:44,872
Just go, Abe.

83
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,974
That doesn't seem fair...

84
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:49,410
they won't let him escape,
then they kick him out.

85
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:50,962
I wonder where he'll go.

86
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:52,964
Either the grave or
somewhere much worse.

87
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:56,200
Sour cream and chives?

88
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:58,402
In my day,
all we put on potatoes

89
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,871
was pine needles
and barber hair.

90
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:02,440
I hate this century.

91
00:06:02,507 --> 00:06:06,877
Okay, we're going to take turns
having Grampa as a roommate.

92
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:08,379
Who wants to go first?

93
00:06:08,447 --> 00:06:10,264
Me! Me!

94
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:13,768
I want him every night,
forever and ever.

95
00:06:13,835 --> 00:06:15,953
'Cause I love my...

96
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:20,825
Nose in a funny book, how rude.

97
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:22,343
Ain't you never heard
of conversation?

98
00:06:22,411 --> 00:06:23,911
Fine.

99
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:25,079
How's it going?

100
00:06:25,147 --> 00:06:26,447
Terrible.

101
00:06:26,515 --> 00:06:28,799
I got this new roommate
and he won't stop yapping.

102
00:06:28,884 --> 00:06:32,136
Here's an experiment for you:

103
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,156
Find a man who wants
to marry a lady poindexter.

104
00:06:36,758 --> 00:06:38,442
Homie...

105
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,544
Hey, you call that making love?

106
00:06:40,612 --> 00:06:43,047
Homer, I told you he
wouldn't sleep through it.

107
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:45,316
In my day, women
didn't make a sound.

108
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:51,973
This calls for some
Springfield Silvertongue.

109
00:06:55,677 --> 00:06:57,378
Dad, look.

110
00:06:57,446 --> 00:06:59,013
This essence of a wildflower

111
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:01,515
makes these angry
scorpions docile.

112
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,250
That's great, honey.

113
00:07:03,318 --> 00:07:05,953
If you were a boy,
you'd be a scientist.

114
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:07,188
Back off, you mutt.

115
00:07:07,255 --> 00:07:09,457
Or I'll make dog-head
soup out of you.

116
00:07:09,524 --> 00:07:15,546
Hmm, if it works on nasty
scorpions, then maybe...

117
00:07:15,614 --> 00:07:18,632
it'll work on nasty stains.

118
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:23,437
It does.

119
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,844
And there's something else
it might be good for.

120
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,101
Why are you guys
eating so fast?

121
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:40,654
Trying to get out of here
before Grampa wakes up.

122
00:07:43,258 --> 00:07:44,341
That's him!

123
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:45,543
Mom, quick, our lunches!

124
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,361
Go! Save yourselves!

125
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,249
Good morning, family.

126
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:53,884
It's such a beautiful day,

127
00:07:53,952 --> 00:07:56,187
I thought I'd take my little
friend here for a walk.

128
00:07:56,254 --> 00:07:58,222
Abe, are you feeling all right?

129
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,890
Never better.

130
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,860
The sun is shining, there's
a spring in my slippers

131
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:07,298
and my wonderful son woke me up
with a delicious cup of coffee.

132
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:09,133
Hmm...

133
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:13,904
Dad, is there anything
unusual in Grampa's coffee?

134
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:15,272
Uh, you look tense.

135
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,110
Let's discuss this over a cup
of Grampa's coffee.

136
00:08:27,677 --> 00:08:29,144
Here you go, champ.

137
00:08:29,211 --> 00:08:31,513
Go buy yourself some
rock-and-roll records.

138
00:08:31,581 --> 00:08:32,864
To the antique store.

139
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,701
Now, what can I do for you?

140
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:38,336
Eat something green?

141
00:08:38,404 --> 00:08:40,105
Vote for someone brown?

142
00:08:40,172 --> 00:08:43,608
Dad, I know what you did.

143
00:08:45,061 --> 00:08:46,978
- And I locked the back door.
- D'oh!

144
00:08:48,497 --> 00:08:51,266
...and that's why you're
acting so sweet and kind.

145
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:53,251
Because Dad drugged you.

146
00:08:56,672 --> 00:08:59,808
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

147
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,960
Your kisses feel
like raw liver.

148
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:04,012
But it's not real happiness.

149
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,514
It's just because
of an untested drug.

150
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:08,083
So what?

151
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,551
There are no
guarantees in life.

152
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:11,919
We don't know if this...

153
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:13,254
knife is safe.

154
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:16,524
Turns out it's not.

155
00:09:16,592 --> 00:09:21,496
The point is, when I'm cranky,
nobody likes me, sweet pea.

156
00:09:21,564 --> 00:09:26,067
Let me live as a happy man
for my remaining 30 years.

157
00:09:26,135 --> 00:09:29,004
Come on, come on,
make with the laffy juice.

158
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:31,473
I want to take Grampa to have
his belly button pierced.

159
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,291
I could hang
my Purple Heart from it.

160
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:37,329
♪ Ya-da-dee-dee-dee,
la-da-da-da-da-da-da... ♪

161
00:09:37,396 --> 00:09:39,764
♪ Ya-da-dee-dee... ♪
♪ Do-do-do, do-do-do-do... ♪

162
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:45,003
It was wrong
of me to play goddess.

163
00:10:01,954 --> 00:10:06,274
Everything everyone just said
is either obvious or wrong.

164
00:10:06,342 --> 00:10:08,460
Homer, do something
about your dad.

165
00:10:08,527 --> 00:10:11,029
He's casting a pall over this
grim dungeon full of losers.

166
00:10:11,097 --> 00:10:12,647
Pfft! Dungeon?!

167
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:13,998
We can leave anytime we want.

168
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:18,470
Homer, why don't you just make
some more of the serum yourself?

169
00:10:18,537 --> 00:10:21,906
Oh, because Lisa won't tell
me what flower it's from.

170
00:10:21,974 --> 00:10:23,108
Excuse me...

171
00:10:23,175 --> 00:10:25,543
My name is Walther Hotenhoffer

172
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:27,912
and I'm in
the pharmaceutical business.

173
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,547
I was wondering when that guy

174
00:10:29,615 --> 00:10:31,282
was gonna state his
name and occupation.

175
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,600
Quiet!

176
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:34,786
Sir, has your daughter
found a drug

177
00:10:34,854 --> 00:10:38,189
that renders old people
tolerable to us normals?

178
00:10:38,257 --> 00:10:40,492
Yeah, but Lisa won't
tell me how to make it.

179
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,893
Lisa is irrelevant.

180
00:10:41,961 --> 00:10:43,461
You'd better elaborate.

181
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:46,398
All I need is one
drop of extract,

182
00:10:46,465 --> 00:10:49,033
and I can synthesize
the drug at my plant.

183
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:51,386
But where do I find that drop?

184
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:53,922
<i>Nein...</i>

185
00:10:53,989 --> 00:10:55,090
<i>Nein...</i>

186
00:10:55,157 --> 00:10:56,257
<i>Nein...</i>

187
00:10:56,325 --> 00:10:57,292
<i>Nein...</i>

188
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:58,460
Aha!

189
00:11:00,162 --> 00:11:02,981
Not so fast, Fritz.

190
00:11:03,048 --> 00:11:06,384
Before you waltz off with my
grampa grease, I want to know...

191
00:11:06,452 --> 00:11:09,187
what did you do during the war?

192
00:11:09,255 --> 00:11:10,889
World War II?

193
00:11:10,956 --> 00:11:12,157
I wasn't born yet.

194
00:11:12,224 --> 00:11:15,894
Funny how many Germans
say that these days.

195
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,534
Hmm?

196
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:35,947
From that one droplet,

197
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:39,233
I have synthesized
50 different compounds.

198
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:42,236
<i>Please identify the one
that is ausgezeichnet.</i>

199
00:11:42,288 --> 00:11:44,522
Nothing. Nothing.

200
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,840
Can't feel my fingers.

201
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:47,075
Feel 'em too much.

202
00:11:47,143 --> 00:11:48,343
Erection.

203
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,377
Derection.

204
00:11:49,445 --> 00:11:51,446
I smell music.

205
00:11:51,514 --> 00:11:53,481
Oh, this'll never work.

206
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:55,784
But when you're doing it
with people you love,

207
00:11:55,851 --> 00:11:58,653
you just can't help smiling.

208
00:11:58,721 --> 00:12:00,522
<i>Jawohl.</i>

209
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:02,240
I've isolated the molecule.

210
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:03,408
Nerd.

211
00:12:03,476 --> 00:12:06,494
Now we test him.

212
00:12:06,562 --> 00:12:08,797
"How do you feel about
the high salaries

213
00:12:08,864 --> 00:12:11,266
of today's
baseball players?"

214
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,135
Oh, don't get me
started on that one.

215
00:12:14,203 --> 00:12:17,005
They're just plain better
than the greats of my day.

216
00:12:17,072 --> 00:12:20,625
God bless them, and their
refusal to learn English.

217
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:24,412
Huh?

218
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,097
This one didn't
make me feel anything.

219
00:12:26,165 --> 00:12:28,967
D'oh!

220
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:33,671
These are my "Suitcase Suzies,"

221
00:12:33,739 --> 00:12:36,224
who will use their beauty
and free giveaways

222
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,893
to make sure our drug
is prescribed.

223
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:40,461
Cool.

224
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:41,896
Are they robots?

225
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:44,632
No, robots can develop
human feelings.

226
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,819
We're graduates
of Arizona State.

227
00:12:47,903 --> 00:12:50,755
We scoop them up
by the sorority.

228
00:12:50,823 --> 00:12:54,576
Uh... this is
the nerd fraternity.

229
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:57,161
Drop them in research.

230
00:12:58,364 --> 00:12:59,614
Nice.

231
00:12:59,665 --> 00:13:03,317
Thank you for the tour
of your factory, Mr. Wonka.

232
00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:06,104
I am not Willy Wonka.

233
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:07,305
No, no.

234
00:13:07,373 --> 00:13:09,374
You're Augustus Gloop,
the fat German boy.

235
00:13:09,441 --> 00:13:13,144
<i>Ja, it is true, I am Gloop.</i>

236
00:13:13,212 --> 00:13:16,648
Being stuck in that tube
changed me in so many ways.

237
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:20,051
Gentlemen, we've been doing
a lot of funny things today,

238
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:22,487
but now I must be scary.

239
00:13:22,555 --> 00:13:26,157
Go ahead.
Here is the prototype of our pill.

240
00:13:26,225 --> 00:13:29,894
Grampapa, no one but you
should take this drug

241
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:32,447
until it has been through
rigorous trials.

242
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:35,316
Be careful... if the wrong
hands got hold of it,

243
00:13:35,384 --> 00:13:37,118
a fortune could be made

244
00:13:37,186 --> 00:13:39,153
by selling this drug
on the black market.

245
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:42,173
Hmm... wrong hands, eh?

246
00:13:42,241 --> 00:13:44,025
That's your cue, boys.

247
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:49,480
You sell drugs.

248
00:13:49,548 --> 00:13:51,215
Why can't you dress like that?

249
00:13:51,283 --> 00:13:53,017
Because I use them, too, idiot.

250
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:04,520
No wonder you've
still got pimples at your age.

251
00:14:04,587 --> 00:14:06,555
You got all this
candy in your desk.

252
00:14:06,623 --> 00:14:08,957
They're Tums,
for my acid reflux.

253
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:10,859
Even your acid wants out of you.

254
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,064
I got something to
stuff in that old bag.

255
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,938
Accursed tide.

256
00:14:23,006 --> 00:14:25,407
Flee from my wrath.

257
00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:28,894
No! I've been moistened!

258
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:31,296
I've got some junk to put
a smile on that corpse.

259
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:47,162
Don't player hate.

260
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,630
I'm just a businessboy.

261
00:14:48,698 --> 00:14:51,033
All right, Bart.
What are you up to now?

262
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:09,501
Now that's what
I call a fishing trip.

263
00:15:09,552 --> 00:15:11,386
That's what I was gonna call it.

264
00:15:12,922 --> 00:15:16,124
Wait, I can't go in there
grinning like a Swede on payday.

265
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:18,193
It'll rile up poor Lisa

266
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:21,029
if she knows I'm still
popping that smiley-pill.

267
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:22,898
Oh, yeah... you better
"grump it up."

268
00:15:35,011 --> 00:15:37,546
Three dollars for
a cup of coffee?!

269
00:15:37,614 --> 00:15:40,916
In my day it cost you a dime and
they gave you back a quarter.

270
00:15:40,984 --> 00:15:43,452
And another thing... the, uh...

271
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,355
It's okay, Grampa...
you don't have to act grumpy.

272
00:15:46,422 --> 00:15:47,723
I know you're taking the drug,

273
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,458
and I don't mind,
'cause you're happy.

274
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:51,627
Oh! Thanks, sweetie.

275
00:15:51,694 --> 00:15:53,395
I'm sorry I was so stubborn.

276
00:15:53,463 --> 00:15:55,130
I hope you're not mad.

277
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:56,665
Oh, I ain't mad,

278
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:58,901
and I never will be again...

279
00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:01,003
thanks to your
wonderful, wonderful...

280
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:09,211
Let me finish: thanks to your
wonderful, wonderful drug.

281
00:16:18,908 --> 00:16:21,626
It happened
to the scorpions, too.

282
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:23,995
The flower essence
must have the side effect

283
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,698
of lubricating the eye sockets
to the point of popping.

284
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:29,000
More saline, please.

285
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:31,686
At some point, I think
we should see a doctor.

286
00:16:31,754 --> 00:16:34,789
No, it's cool... it's like
we got our own monster.

287
00:16:34,857 --> 00:16:36,758
Your grandfather
is not a monster.

288
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:38,643
Now, let's chain him
in the basement

289
00:16:38,711 --> 00:16:39,978
until the circus comes to town.

290
00:16:40,062 --> 00:16:41,312
Sounds good.

291
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,716
At least no one else
has taken this drug.

292
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:48,386
Bart, why are you
tugging on your collar?

293
00:16:48,454 --> 00:16:50,572
It better be tonsillitis.

294
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,273
Well, actually...

295
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:56,311
I may have accidentally traded a
few of those pills for money...

296
00:16:57,446 --> 00:16:59,481
Which I may have already spent,

297
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:01,883
ironically,
on these novelty eyeglasses.

298
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,419
Howdy, handsome.

299
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:05,620
Look!

300
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:15,146
Ooh!

301
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:22,120
Ooh, yeah, yeah.

302
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:23,555
Who loves Mommy's eyeballs?

303
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:25,757
Oh, there's a kitty
gonna sleep good tonight.

304
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:27,125
Yes, you are.

305
00:17:31,347 --> 00:17:34,216
So, I guess we're all
in the same boat, huh?

306
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:35,784
<i>Nein, nein.</i>

307
00:17:35,852 --> 00:17:38,403
My boat is me
and hundreds of lawyers.

308
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:40,755
Your boat has you
and a lot of people

309
00:17:40,823 --> 00:17:42,457
with their eyes falling out.

310
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:45,577
Walther, when a man puts
something on a Frisbee,

311
00:17:45,628 --> 00:17:47,062
he should stand by it.

312
00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:48,597
See?

313
00:17:48,664 --> 00:17:49,858
You are right.

314
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,837
As always, the Frisbee is
the mirror to the soul.

315
00:17:54,904 --> 00:17:56,405
Mr. Hotenhoffer,
there's a mob outside.

316
00:17:56,472 --> 00:17:58,907
An angry mob?

317
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:00,509
No, a cheerful mob.

318
00:18:00,576 --> 00:18:03,645
I'd like to have just one day

319
00:18:03,713 --> 00:18:06,181
when I don't put
a gun to my head.

320
00:18:10,153 --> 00:18:12,120
Now, I ain't much
for speeches...

321
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:18,260
But we sure do appreciate
what you done for us,

322
00:18:18,327 --> 00:18:21,997
and, uh, we were just hoping
we could get more of that drug.

323
00:18:24,017 --> 00:18:25,283
Lots more.

324
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:29,988
Those poor googly-eyed fools.

325
00:18:30,056 --> 00:18:32,190
I cannot exploit them like this.

326
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:35,093
I will have to be content
exploiting their fear

327
00:18:35,161 --> 00:18:37,129
of losing hair and penis.

328
00:18:37,196 --> 00:18:40,032
I will destroy the drug.

329
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:41,833
What? Well, I never...

330
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:44,903
Walther, let's not be so hasty.

331
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:47,105
Who would begrudge
them a few years

332
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:49,708
of shambling, dope-fogged,
into the grave?

333
00:18:49,776 --> 00:18:53,345
Besides, our generation's got
everything under control.

334
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:55,530
Now, if you'll excuse me,

335
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,416
I was supposed to be
drunk an hour ago.

336
00:18:57,483 --> 00:18:58,917
To Moe's.

337
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:02,704
Flat tires?

338
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:04,122
No problem.

339
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:07,209
Oh!

340
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:09,578
Homer, use your head.
Just buy a new car.

341
00:19:09,645 --> 00:19:11,863
Great idea, but I don't
have any money.

342
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:14,583
You could take out a loan
with your house as collateral.

343
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,669
And I wouldn't have to pay it
back for three more years.

344
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,771
What are the odds
of that much time happening?

345
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,873
Pretty close to zero, I'd say.

346
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:23,408
Problem solved.

347
00:19:23,476 --> 00:19:25,844
Generation awesome
does it again.

348
00:19:25,912 --> 00:19:28,363
Boo-ya!
Oh, yes!

349
00:19:28,431 --> 00:19:30,949
All right,
you googly-eyed geezers,

350
00:19:31,016 --> 00:19:33,602
turn up your hearing aids...
I've got something to say.

351
00:19:35,455 --> 00:19:38,023
Together, we survived the
Depression, won a few wars

352
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:40,025
and put a man on the moon.

353
00:19:40,093 --> 00:19:43,328
In fact, the only mistake
our generation made

354
00:19:43,396 --> 00:19:45,580
was creating that generation.

355
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:49,668
If we want to set
these bumblers straight,

356
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:52,921
it's going to take all the
crankiness we can muster.

357
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:56,057
So put down those pills,
pop in your eyeballs

358
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,527
and "upside-down" them smiles.

359
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:02,397
Let's do as he says.

360
00:20:14,944 --> 00:20:16,978
Wow, their "can-do"

361
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:21,016
will bail out our
"won't-try" every time.

362
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,952
So I guess the lesson here is...

363
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,822
If you go on a field trip,
don't break off from the group.

364
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:30,392
And if you are a fat little boy
in a chocolate factory,

365
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:32,227
never try to drink
from the river.

366
00:20:32,295 --> 00:20:33,195
The tube.

367
00:20:33,262 --> 00:20:34,229
My God.

368
00:20:34,297 --> 00:20:36,631
Every night I see the tube.
