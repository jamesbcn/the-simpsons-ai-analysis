00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,665
Dad, how do you get
a girl to like you?

180
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:07,051
Son, whether you want to win
a girl or crack a nut,

181
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,839
the key is persistence.

182
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,803
Keep at it,
and never lose your cool.

183
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,304
(grunts)

184
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,347
Ah, come on,
you stupid...

185
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,725
Let that be a lesson
to the rest of you... nuts.

186
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,270
Okay, Dad.
I'll be persistent.

187
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,234
Is that how you got Mom?

188
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,443
Well, son,

189
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,034
never underestimate the appeal
of a man in uniform.

190
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,901
Oh, yeah!

191
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,275
(Wiggum chewing)

192
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,235
Oh. Mmm.
Oh, yeah.

193
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,001
<i>Hey, boys and girls,</i>
<i>only four days</i>

194
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,543
<i>till my anniversary show.</i>

195
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,086
<i>29 years,</i>
<i>and when I came on,</i>

196
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,550
<i>they said</i>
<i>I wouldn't last a week.</i>

197
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,420
<i>And you know where</i>
<i>those reviewers are?</i>

198
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,257
<i>All dead.</i>

199
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:56,552
<i>How you doing down there,</i>
<i>fellas? Huh? Huh?</i>

200
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,137
<i>Anyway, here's a clip.</i>

201
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:03,312
<i>Now why do they call this</i>
<i>a urine monkey?</i>

202
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,024
<i>Oh... I just found out.</i>

203
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,935
That's funny
for so many reasons.

204
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,355
We have to go
to that show.

205
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,453
Forget it.
To get those tickets,

206
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:13,608
our parents would
have to be part

207
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,486
of Springfield's
cultural elite.

208
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,203
Can you believe Flanders

209
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,543
threw out a perfectly
good toothbrush?

210
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,331
Ew.

211
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,504
(doorbell ringing)

212
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,212
Oh, no, it's Ralph.

213
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,634
Just make up some excuse.

214
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,633
She's in the can.
Go away.

215
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,665
Yes, sir.

216
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,298
I'd do anything for Lisa.

217
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,894
Really?

218
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,389
Mr. Simpson, the tar fumes
are making me dizzy.

219
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,897
Yeah, they'll do that.

220
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,358
"Dearest Martha,
since boyhood

221
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,492
"I have yearned to be
on the one-dollar bill,

222
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:57,109
"and with your help,
this, I shall achieve.

223
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,118
Sincerely, George Washington."

224
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,580
(class applauds)

225
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,290
Thank you, Rex.

226
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,753
I've selected the cast
for our Presidents' Day pageant.

227
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,962
Martha Washington
will be played by...

228
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,923
-Lisa Simpson.
-(giggles)

229
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,343
HOOVER: George Washington
will be played by...

230
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,552
(clears throat)

231
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,012
-Ralph Wiggum.
-(gasps)

232
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,052
Hmm.

233
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,394
What? This is a travesty.

234
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,430
Everyone knows
I'm the best actor

235
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,774
in this ridiculous school.

236
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,098
-Sit down, Rex.
-I will not sit down.

237
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,274
Someone's gotten to you,
you deceitful cow.

238
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,733
That's absurd, Rex.

239
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,523
Ralph won the part
fair and square.

240
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,107
That's the signal.

241
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,492
Take the boot
off the car, boys.

242
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,569
(chuckling)

243
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,735
Now Ralph is
in the play with me.

244
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,534
I just know he's going
to embarrass me

245
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,577
in front
of the whole school.

246
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,581
(knocking)

247
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,752
Huh?

248
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,915
Oh, no,
it's a package from Ralph.

249
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:56,415
Oh, a Malibu Stacy
convertible.

250
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,217
"Look in the tunk."

251
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,680
He must mean "trunk."

252
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,971
(gasps) Tickets to
the Krusty anniversary show!

253
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,137
Oh, he must want me
to go with him.

254
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,847
Oh, it isn't fair.

255
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,267
I'm ten times
the Krusty fan you are.

256
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,646
I even have the Krusty
home pregnancy test.

257
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,605
I'm not sure I should go.
I don't even like him.

258
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,066
You're right, Lis.
You shouldn't go.

259
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,276
It wouldn't be honest.

260
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,325
I'll go, disguised as you.

261
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,239
What if he wants
to hold hands?

262
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,947
I'm prepared to make
that sacrifice.

263
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,497
What if he wants a kiss?

264
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,541
I'm prepared to make
that sacrifice.

265
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:30,673
What if he--

266
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,330
You don't want to know
how far I'll go.

267
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,958
Dad, is it right

268
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,705
to take things from people
you don't like?

269
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,917
Sure it is, honey.

270
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,088
You do mean stealing,
don't you?

271
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,507
{\an8}Well, actually,
it's not as bad as stealing,

272
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,346
but my conscience
is bothering me.

273
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,851
Your conscience?

274
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,522
Lisa, don't let
that pushy, little weenie

275
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,942
tell you what to do.

276
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,230
Homer, that's
a terrible thing to say.

277
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,444
Oh, shut up.

278
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,233
Yes, sir.

279
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,737
I am so glad you
cho-cho-choose to come.

280
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,702
Heh. I think you should
give that a rest, Ralph.

281
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,994
Chief Wiggum, how did you
ever get these tickets?

282
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,787
Krusty knows
how to play ball.

283
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,208
Ah... nothing beats
a good porno movie.

284
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,755
Chief Wiggum,
is this a bust?

285
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,049
Uh, yeah.

286
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,512
That's just what it is,
a bust.

287
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,553
That story isn't suitable
for children.

288
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,467
Really? I keep my pants on
in this version.

289
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,476
Ew.

290
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,678
ANNOUNCER:
<i>It's the Krusty the Clown</i>

291
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,438
<i>29th Anniversary Show!</i>

292
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,770
Hey!

293
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,694
(applause and cheering)

294
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,154
Thank you. Thank you.

295
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,284
Hey, Mr. President.

296
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,571
I campaigned
for the other guy,

297
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,284
but I voted for you.

298
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,244
(goofy laughter)

299
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,244
You know, I started this
show so long ago,

300
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:52,117
the ayatollah only
had a goatee. Ha ha!

301
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,366
(buzzer sounds)

302
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,594
What's the matter,

303
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,589
don't you people
read the papers?

304
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,921
Ah, let's look at some clips.

305
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,934
{\an8}"He will not see me
stopping here

306
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,600
{\an8}to watch his woods
fill up with snow..."

307
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,560
{\an8}Hey, Frosty, you want some
snow, man? Bwah!

308
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,555
{\an8}We discussed this,
and I said no.

309
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,896
(applause)

310
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,232
Now, here's a clip from 1973.

311
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,777
<i>♪ Try to run, try to hide ♪</i>

312
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,533
<i>♪ Break on through</i>
<i>to the other side ♪</i>

313
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,905
<i>♪ Yeah ♪</i>

314
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,044
Ah!

315
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,370
What was I on?

316
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,624
Lisa, do you want
a bite of my ice cream?

317
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,628
No, thanks.

318
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,169
Send it this way, boy.

319
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,252
-Whoops.
-Aw.

320
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:44,217
Aw... nothing gets
chocolate out. See?

321
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,550
I've worked with some marvelous
second bananas over the years,

322
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:51,056
but none more memorable
than Sideshow Raheem.

323
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,190
Uh, the script says
I'm supposed to bonk you with this.

324
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,769
I wouldn't.

325
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,274
Right on.

326
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:01,025
(queasy groan)

327
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,608
(applause)

328
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,114
Angry, angry young man.

329
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,776
Now for my favorite
part of the show.

330
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,906
What's that say?

331
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,793
"Talk to the audience?"

332
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,160
Oh, God,
this is always death.

333
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,457
All right.

334
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,920
Oh, no, please don't
show me with Ralph.

335
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,791
What's your name, son?

336
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,088
-Ralph.
-(Lisa whimpers)

337
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,302
And is this
your girlfriend, Ralph?

338
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,932
Yes, I love Lisa Simpson.

339
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,050
And when I grow up,
I'm going to marry her.

340
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,637
No!

341
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,893
Now you listen to me.

342
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,484
I don't like you.
I never liked you.

343
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,520
And the only reason I gave
you that stupid valentine

344
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,614
<i>was because</i>
<i>nobody else would!</i>

345
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,859
Watch this, Lis.
You can actually

346
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,192
pinpoint the second when
his heart rips in half.

347
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,317
And... now.

348
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,739
(groans)

349
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,840
At least you guys
are my friends.

350
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,967
(quacking)

351
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,548
(sighing)

352
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,473
Son, I know just
how you feel.

353
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,351
You've got a great little girl,
and the world's your oyster.

354
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,809
No, Dad, she made
a fool out of me.

355
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,190
Hey, come to think of it,
she did.

356
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,518
Well, she didn't reckon

357
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,484
with the awesome power
of the chief of police.

358
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,485
Now, where did I put my badge?

359
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,948
Hey!
That duck's got it.

360
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,609
Oh, come on, come on,
give it back.

361
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,488
I need it.

362
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,994
Ah, keep it.

363
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,077
(police siren)

364
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,503
Something wrong, officer?

365
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,542
Yeah, got a taillight out.

366
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,206
Where?

367
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,674
Right there.

368
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,634
You know, one day honest
citizens are going to stand up

369
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,376
to you crooked cops.

370
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,967
They are? Oh, no.

371
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,762
Have they set a date?

372
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,017
This orange drink
is the only way

373
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,074
to recoup our terrible losses
from "Fire Drill Follies."

374
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,899
I just don't know
what went wrong.

375
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,744
You opened the show
with a fire drill,

376
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,989
and everyone cleared out.

377
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,031
Hmm. So mother was right.

378
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,195
It was my fault.

379
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,664
Go ahead,
water it down some more.

380
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:21,705
My God, man, I've watered her
down as far as she'll go.

381
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,710
I cannot water no more.

382
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,303
Good evening,
everyone, and welcome

383
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,128
to a wonderful evening
of theater

384
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:32,263
and picking up
after yourselves.

385
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:36,012
We begin with a tribute to
our lesser-known presidents.

386
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,176

00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,183
(imitating Nixon)
I am not a butt.

399
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,175
(screaming)

400
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,227
Bart, do you want to
play John Wilkes Booth,

401
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,691
or do you want to
act like a maniac?

402
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,691
I'll be good.

403
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,819
Ralph, I'm sorry I--

404
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,993
Leave me alone.

405
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,161
I'm here to play
George Washington.

406
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,080
Uh... Ralph?

407
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:43,657
Miss Hoover, this beard's
giving me a rash.

408
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,167
Milhouse, you have one line
and then you're shot.

409
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,330
Now get out there.

410
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:52,012
I thought that Civil War
would never end.

411
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,969
Now to soothe my head

412
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,799
with an evening
at Ford's Theater.

413
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,635
Oh, no, John Wilkes Booth!

414
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,931
Hasta la vista, Abie.

415
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,475
(Milhouse grunting,
Bart imitating gunshots)

416
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,521
Come on boy, finish him off.

417
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,944
(screaming)

418
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,532
You're next,
Chester A. Arthur.

419
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,360
Unhand me, yankee.

420
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,695
And now our evening
comes to an end.

421
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,701
Woo-hoo!

422
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,332
With a thorough re-telling

423
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,239
of the life
of George Washington.

424
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,577
HOMER:
D'oh!

425
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,456
Dear, dear George Washington.

426
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:33,013
Can this liberty you dream of
be worth all this bloodshed?

427
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,679
Well, can it?

428
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,971
Dear madam,
would you put a price

429
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,637
on the air we breathe,

430
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,976
or the providence
that sustains us?

431
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,651
But couldn't we just
give in to the British?

432
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,271
Never!

433
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,067
(cheering, applause)

434
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,321
That boy is magnificent.

435
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,574
He makes me want to learn more
about our founding fathers.

436
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,237
To the library.

437
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,866
Yeah!

438
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:07,582
Dear Martha, I fear
my time is at hand.

439
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,634
Oh, George.

440
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,879
Your broth,
Mr. President.

441
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,341
I asked for no broth.

442
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,762
Away with you, lest my cane
find your backside.

443
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:19,932
Hmm, yes.

444
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,010
(sobbing)

445
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,346
Please don't leave me,
George.

446
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,692
Dear wife, if I could take
but one treasure

447
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,189
with me
to the next life,

448
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,771
it would be
your tender kiss.

449
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,652
Mmm...

450
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,856
Now that's a man.

451
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,495
I did not cry
when me own father

452
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,711
was hung for stealing a pig,

453
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:55,552
but I'll cry now.
