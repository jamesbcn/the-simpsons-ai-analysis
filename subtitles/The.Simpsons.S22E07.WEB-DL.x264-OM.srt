1
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,367
Ooh!

2
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,646
D'oh!

3
00:01:09,786 --> 00:01:10,886
Mm-hmm...

4
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,660
Ooh!

5
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,239
D'oh!

6
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:50,726
Oh, don't be scared, boys.
That's just the angels bowling.

7
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,178
And so The Bloody Hangman,
his hair sticky with blood,

8
00:02:09,245 --> 00:02:11,947
skittered along the
cobblestones,

9
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:15,167
gunk dripping
from his one good eye,

10
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:18,387
singing his evil land chantey.

No, I'm not!

20
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:50,219
Yes, I am.

21
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:54,256
The Bloody Hangman walks on his
stubby bone feet

22
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:57,993
<i>through the plague-ridden</i>
<i>streets of London...</i>

23
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:00,829
You said it was Boston.

24
00:03:00,897 --> 00:03:02,231
Did I?

25
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:07,202
Anyway, The Bloody Hangman
set to his gory work.

26
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,874
Bodies piled up like those
stackable plastic chairs.

27
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,809
Like those chairs
in the music room?

28
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:15,210
Possibly!

29
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:22,451
The Hangman's here!

30
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,087
♪ Ker-shaw, ker-shew,
my lies have come true! ♪

31
00:03:26,155 --> 00:03:28,490
Huh. It's a pigeon.

32
00:03:28,558 --> 00:03:31,360
Aw, the poor guy
hurt his wing.

33
00:03:31,427 --> 00:03:32,861
Hey, there's a
number on him.

34
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:34,429
What is it?

35
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:36,965
I bet it's a
combination to a safe!

36
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:40,736
Or, more likely, the phone
number of the bird's owner.

37
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:43,972
Ask about the safe.

38
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,341
No, better yet, act like you
know about the safe.

39
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:47,709
Hello.

40
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:50,846
Yes, I believe I have your
pigeon, "Raymond Bird,"

41
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:52,748
and I need to know how
to return him to you.

42
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,634
He's a homing pigeon, girlie.
Why don't you let him fly home?

43
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:57,619
Unless you want
to spring for a limo.

44
00:03:57,687 --> 00:04:02,024
Yes, he could fly home, except
that he has a broken wing.

45
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:03,959
Perhaps you and your sarcasm

46
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:06,261
could come to Springfield
and retrieve him.

47
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,529
Are you kidding?

48
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:10,032
Wherever I go, 200 birds gotta
come with me.

49
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:12,834
And they all want to sit in the
front seat with Daddy.

50
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,074
Looks like you're going to have
to take care of him, Bart.

51
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:22,010
Me? Just what in my long,
sad history with frogs

52
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:24,079
makes you think I can
take care of a bird?

53
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:26,248
No, no...

54
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:28,617
Listen, don't tell
anyone, but...

55
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,185
I can't stand pigeons!

56
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:31,853
They're like rats with wings!

57
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:33,288
He's crawling on your arm.

58
00:04:34,724 --> 00:04:38,026
Oh... Okay, maybe
he's not so bad.

59
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,999
Oh! No! No! No! Get off!
Get off! Get off!

60
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:31,747
Okay, Ray, your wing is healed.
Go on.

61
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:32,981
Live your life.

62
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:38,153
Aw, c'mon, man.

63
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:40,322
Admit it-- you knew this day
would come.

64
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:01,226
You and I have shared too many
seed bells

65
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,145
to just walk away from this.

66
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:08,817
Go ahead,
make fun of me.

67
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:10,752
I lost my heart to a bird.

68
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,421
Haw-haw.

69
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:15,257
Man, you were not into that.
What's wrong?

70
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:18,060
My mom ran off
with my birthday clown.

71
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,587
All finished, boy.

72
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,122
That coop looks a little flimsy.

73
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,457
Flimsy?

74
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:34,827
This gentle pat says different.

75
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,201
D'oh!

76
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,769
Now that you're
officially my bird,

77
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,072
let me fill you in on the
pecking order around here.

78
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,475
The top dog is me, followed by
the top dog, the dog...

79
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,277
then the cat and then you...

80
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:53,245
But don't feel bad.
You're ahead of Milhouse.

81
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:56,382
C'mon Bart. How long
can you stay mad?

82
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,418
I thought your race car was
a Transformer!

83
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,687
Nothing's one thing anymore!

84
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,622
Sorry, man, it's still too soon.

85
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,258
No problem. I'll just be right
behind this fence,

86
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:09,128
whenever you're ready
to forgive me.

87
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,333
Now? Do you
forgive me now?

88
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,635
Now? Now?

89
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,741
I'm scared, Bart.

90
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,977
<i>Bored by black and</i>

<i>the Allies' winged warrior.</i>

97
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,634
General Patton, this bird
has a message for you.

98
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:51,070
There's a bomb in my helmet.

99
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,106
Caesar can have his eagle,

100
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,442
Alexander the Great
his gryphon...

101
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,978
I'll take the American
fighting pigeon any damn day!

102
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:06,419
Wow, Ray, you have hidden
talents!

103
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,920
Is he good at tic-tac-toe,

104
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,656
like that chicken I played, lost
to, and ate at the State Fair?

105
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,058
No, I was thinking

106
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,060
we could use him to send
messages back and forth.

107
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,294
Way ahead of you.

108
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,970
Mom, why am I so
repulsed by pigeons?

109
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:26,672
It doesn't make any sense.

110
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,642
I'm a member of People for the
Ethical Treatment of Amoebas,

111
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,410
The League of Women Vultures,

112
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,612
the NAAC Porcupines,

Clamnesty International

115
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,320
well, those are the best ones.

116
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:45,224
Sweetie, everyone has an
animal they can't stand.

117
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,326
Indiana Jones had snakes,

118
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:50,463
the Grizzly Man had
grizzlies, and...

119
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,999
you know,
I'm not crazy about opossums.

120
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:54,867
Really?

121
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,369
Those creepy little claws...

122
00:08:58,472 --> 00:08:59,605
Opossum!

123
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,275
Mom, it's just Maggie.

124
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,578
Oh!

125
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,214
Aww... Who's a possum?

126
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,982
You're a possum.

127
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:10,983
What's that?

128
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,451
I'll tell you later.

129
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,692
465 divided by seven equals...
Ooh!

130
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,394
What the...?!

131
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,733
All right, I won't ask who sent
this note

132
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:31,170
if I can use the bird to send
a note of my own.

133
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,404
As long as it means
we're not learning.

134
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:33,939
Deal.

135
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:39,862
"Every day since we broke up
is the greatest day of my life."

136
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,531
Is that from Edna?

137
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:44,300
I feel for you, Seymour.

138
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:47,002
If you ever need a shoulder to
lean on, I'm here for you.

139
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:52,908
"P.S., Chalmers and I
are doing it"?!

140
00:09:52,976 --> 00:09:55,578
She was on the
rebound from Willie.

141
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,432
Ooh, a carrier pigeon.

142
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,903
Perhaps an update on
the siege of Khartoum.

143
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,973
"Do a ballet dance without
no clothes on."

144
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,342
Bad grammar, good advice.

145
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:27,459
I'll... catch up
with you guys later.

146
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,752
Hey, Homer, you ever think
about racing that bird?

147
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,354
You can race pigeons?

148
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,356
Hey, if it moves,
you can bet on it.

149
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,258
What about the
Detroit Lions?

150
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,093
Now, now, lay off Detroit.

151
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,229
Them people is living in
<i>Mad Max</i> times.

152
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,997
But I was thinking
you could enter this bird

153
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:08,500
in the annual Springfield
to Shelbyville Birditarod.

154
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:09,602
Hmm?

155
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,037
Hmm.

156
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:15,608
Me, the patriarch
of a bird-racing dynasty.

157
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,978
Congratulations, Homer.

158
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,879
Danica Patrick
in my thoughts!

159
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,248
That's right, Homer.

160
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,817
I'm contractually
obligated by my sponsors

161
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,885
to appear in random
fans' fantasies.

162
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,554
Better not tell
Marge about this.

163
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:30,689
You Brickyard bimbo!

164
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,329
Ended that a little too soon.

165
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,467
What they don't suspect
is that I'm into this.

166
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,007
Hear that, boy? You're
gonna be a racing pigeon.

167
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,210
It's getting a little chilly;
I better put a blanket on Ray.

168
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,646
Whoa! Dad, help!

169
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,747
Stupid dog!

170
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,181
Let go of that
delicious bird!

171
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,490
No...!

172
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,863
Come on out,
birdie!

173
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,264
Follow the sound of

174
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,966
my voice!

175
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:19,638
It's just as well.

176
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,840
There's no such thing
as a Birditarod.

177
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,543
It was just a trick to

Well, ask your

You haven't earned the right

Dearly beloved,
I'd like to open this service

"Hope is the thing

190
00:13:04,393 --> 00:13:05,493
Oh, stupid dog!

191
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:14,269
This funeral just
got depressing.

That song does make me
feel a little better.

199
00:13:30,253 --> 00:13:31,853
It's from <i>Bye Bye Birdie.</i>

have gone before the jury.

204
00:13:58,114 --> 00:13:59,814
We probably
should deliberate,

205
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,483
but we're kind
of in a hurry.

206
00:14:05,921 --> 00:14:07,222
I never met a dog
I didn't hate.

207
00:14:10,326 --> 00:14:11,993
Ah, yes.

208
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:14,529
A little hair
of the dog that bit me.

209
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:24,906
I hope you've learned
something here.

210
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,981
Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, Bart
has been very sad lately.

211
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:34,349
We know.

212
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:36,251
And we're going to do
something about it.

213
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:37,752
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

214
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,920
Please don't do anything.

215
00:14:38,988 --> 00:14:40,322
Not only have
his grades gone up,

216
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:43,058
but the enthusiasm has
gone out of his pranks.

217
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,492
I mean, take a look at this.

218
00:14:46,195 --> 00:14:47,362
If anything,
I was wondering

219
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,697
if you could make him sadder.

220
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:51,232
How can you say
a thing like that?

221
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,968
Marge, listen to the man;
he pays Bart's salary.

222
00:14:54,036 --> 00:14:55,337
No, he doesn't.

223
00:14:55,404 --> 00:14:57,539
Why can't you support
my gibberish?

224
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,274
I'd do it if
you were stupid.

225
00:14:59,342 --> 00:15:02,060
Marge, Homer, this marital
discord is perfect.

226
00:15:02,128 --> 00:15:05,030
But please, save it for home
where your son can see it.

227
00:15:05,097 --> 00:15:06,364
Oh!

228
00:15:09,935 --> 00:15:13,538
Bart, Santa's Little Helper,
come on in.

229
00:15:13,606 --> 00:15:16,358
A shrink that takes
kids and pets?

230
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:19,427
Hey, in this economy,
I'll even remove tattoos.

231
00:15:19,495 --> 00:15:21,629
Even my tramp stamp?

232
00:15:21,697 --> 00:15:24,132
I got the idea from a show
where people regret these.

233
00:15:25,501 --> 00:15:27,435
Homie, why don't
you study these?

234
00:15:38,347 --> 00:15:39,948
Oh, baby.

235
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:41,549
Well, what do you know!

236
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:42,650
Oh, come on!

237
00:15:42,718 --> 00:15:46,154
So, Marge, what I understand

238
00:15:46,222 --> 00:15:47,889
from our phone conversation is

239
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:50,158
you have a very poor
service provider.

240
00:15:50,226 --> 00:15:53,762
I bought it because
Catherine Zeta-Jones told me to.

241
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:56,097
What a fool I was.

242
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:58,700
Secondly, there's been
a major breach of trust

243
00:15:58,768 --> 00:16:00,969
between Bart and
Santa's Little Helper.

244
00:16:01,036 --> 00:16:02,203
Well, he shouldn't kill birds.

245
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:03,571
It's not right.

246
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:06,241
That is correct,
according to human standards.

247
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:10,345
But all a dog can do is follow
his animal inclinations, right?

248
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:11,279
I guess.

249
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:12,847
So, Bart,

250
00:16:12,915 --> 00:16:14,816
as the one
with the larger brain...

251
00:16:14,884 --> 00:16:16,584
Nicely done, boy.

252
00:16:16,652 --> 00:16:19,154
...maybe you can find it
in your heart to forgive him.

253
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:25,693
See? He's a
questionable character.

254
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:27,595
He used to hang around
racetracks, you know.

255
00:16:27,663 --> 00:16:29,431
Bart, could you
wait outside?

256
00:16:35,588 --> 00:16:36,588
It's not going to work.

257
00:16:36,655 --> 00:16:38,089
You have to give the dog away.

258
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:39,557
Are you sure?

259
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,609
As sure as I am that
I'll be billing you

260
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:42,644
for that torn magazine.

261
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,412
Oh, that's pretty sure.

262
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,613
Subscription rate, right?

263
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:46,748
Newsstand.

264
00:16:46,816 --> 00:16:47,782
D'oh.

265
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,841
Why is <i>it</i>
coming with us?

266
00:16:56,909 --> 00:16:58,509
And for once, I'm not
talking about Lisa.

267
00:16:58,577 --> 00:17:01,512
It's amazing how I can
feel sorry for you

268
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,548
and hate you
at the same time.

269
00:17:03,615 --> 00:17:05,683
I'm sure there's
a German word for it.

270
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:10,721
We're bringing the dog because
we've found him a new home

271
00:17:10,773 --> 00:17:14,559
at a farm upstate where he can
run and play all day.

272
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:16,277
You're gonna put him down?

273
00:17:16,361 --> 00:17:19,781
No! For once, a pet
going to a farm upstate

274
00:17:19,865 --> 00:17:23,000
really is going to
a farm upstate.

275
00:17:23,068 --> 00:17:24,469
What about all the other pets

276
00:17:24,536 --> 00:17:26,270
you told us
went to a farm upstate?

277
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:29,674
Hmm. Backyard, backyard,
toilet, ocean, don't know,

278
00:17:29,741 --> 00:17:33,044
backyard, Flanders' mailbox,
Lenny's freezer, tire fire.

279
00:17:37,483 --> 00:17:39,383
This is where
we're ditching the dog?

280
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:41,786
Well, "ditching"
is a harsh word.

281
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:43,020
Enough chitchat.

282
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:44,722
Time for Operation
Dog Dump.

283
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,624
It wasn't really
a lot of chitchat.

284
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:47,758
It was still
too much.

285
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:55,166
We'll take good
care of your dog.

286
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:56,634
I'm sure you will,

287
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:59,136
because you take such good care
of your ostriches.

288
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:01,639
D'oh.

289
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,773
Maybe we should
get going.

290
00:18:04,576 --> 00:18:07,812
Bart, sweetie, would you
like to say good-bye?

291
00:18:09,948 --> 00:18:12,216
Well, boy, I guess this is it.

292
00:18:12,284 --> 00:18:14,318
We've shared a lot
of great memories,

293
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:16,654
like the time we got
our picture in the paper

294
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,856
with the caption
"Who's walking who?"

295
00:18:18,924 --> 00:18:21,359
I mailed them the answer,
but they never printed it.

296
00:18:22,828 --> 00:18:25,596
But it's not my fault
you're leaving, it's yours.

297
00:18:25,664 --> 00:18:26,731
Because you should never,

298
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:28,332
ever kill a bird!

299
00:18:28,383 --> 00:18:29,317
Ever!

300
00:18:29,384 --> 00:18:31,385
I'd like a moment to myself.

301
00:18:35,524 --> 00:18:37,808
Ooh, unknown caller!

302
00:18:38,877 --> 00:18:39,710
Hey!

303
00:18:43,615 --> 00:18:46,350
All right, you, give me back
my phone and nobody gets hurt!

304
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:48,920
You said nobody gets hurt!

305
00:18:48,987 --> 00:18:50,688
Those were your exact words!

306
00:19:06,238 --> 00:19:08,973
So, Lisa, do you want an
ostrich feather centerpiece?

307
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,408
Not really.

308
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:12,143
Well, we've got
to buy something.

309
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:16,080
Help!

310
00:19:17,716 --> 00:19:19,283
Kill the bird!

311
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:22,019
Never kill a bird!
Never kill a bird!

312
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:32,563
Why, you little...

313
00:19:39,738 --> 00:19:42,039
Pa! You got to see this!

314
00:19:43,508 --> 00:19:45,509
Oh, right, I-I forgot.

315
00:19:50,182 --> 00:19:51,816
Oh.

316
00:19:55,621 --> 00:19:57,588
More Oxycontin
Candy, sweetie?

317
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:58,489
Mm-hmm.

318
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:08,899
Well, boy, I guess
I owe you an apology.

319
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:10,935
Who's a bird-eating monster?

320
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:12,603
You are! You are!

321
00:20:12,654 --> 00:20:14,538
Yes, you are.

322
00:20:14,606 --> 00:20:16,040
Aw.

323
00:20:16,108 --> 00:20:18,843
Well, Bart learned a lesson,
and most important of all,

324
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,929
we don't have to stop
and pick up dinner.

325
00:20:21,997 --> 00:20:23,397
You do for me.

326
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:41,227
<i>Help me!</i>

327
00:21:22,436 --> 00:21:24,304
Shh!
