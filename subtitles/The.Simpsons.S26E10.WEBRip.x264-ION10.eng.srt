00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:46,362
Take these pills,
and you can breathe our atmosphere.

173
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,862
Are there any side effects?

174
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,034
Yes, I'm afraid you will never
develop tentacles.

175
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,033
(groans)

176
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:59,037
Behold the wonders of our world.

177
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,461
Purple landscape, purple trees.

178
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,792
Yeah, you really went
with the purple theme.

179
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,127
We can change it at will.

180
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:11,552
Now look upward to see our seven suns.

181
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,514
(gasps)
So, you use a lot of solar energy?

182
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,715
We have federal rebates for the panels,

183
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,596
but few take advantage of them.

184
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:24,112
Now we shall show you
the sacred mysteries of our life cycle.

185
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,568
Behold, our miracle of birth.

186
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,949
Each birth is followed
by another birth just seconds later.

187
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,408
(groans)

188
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,368
(all groaning)

189
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,365
And finally, a sadder slice of our lives.

190
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:45,955
Gaze upon the dead being dumped
into a river of their own drool.

191
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,878
(bagpipes playing)

192
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,513
Farewell, dear friends,

193
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,220
on your sacred journey
to the chopper-upper.

194
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,301
-Aw.
-Why are you sharing all this with us?

195
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,807
Because we want you to
fully appreciate the planet...

196
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,100
that you will never leave!

197
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,064
(gasping)

198
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,515
Wait, are you telling me

199
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,186
we're prisoners in this cage?

200
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,864
(bagpipes playing)

201
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,780
Okay, take five.

202
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,199
(dissonant bagpipe chord)

203
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,036
(screeching)

204
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,337
Don't look at them.

205
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,762
You can see those birds any time.

206
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,051
-(meows)
-(screams)

207
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,933
{\an8}Right hand red!

208
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,556
{\an8}-Aah!
-I win.

209
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,443
{\an8}-I think.
-(grunts)

210
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,702
Would you like one of our toys?

211
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,033
Thanks.

212
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,695
Why did you do that?

213
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,287
I thought it was a ball.

214
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,872
That is the one thing it can never be.

215
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,842
(plays instrument out of tune)

216
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,387
Don't be alarmed.

217
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,430
I am a trained humanologist.

218
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,684
Let me just check your heart.

219
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,726
All well and good.
You obviously exercise.

220
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,941
-(nasally) See, Marge?
-Anything you need?

221
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,821
Perhaps you'd care to have
your ink gland expressed.

222
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,239
-You're the doctor.
-Homer!

223
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,318
You have to stop dropping your pants

224
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,574
for everyone who claims they're a doctor.

225
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,116
-Fine.
-Now, I am here to complete

226
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,080
your knowledge of
our great and generous species.

227
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,711
Are you the guy that talks nice
before they kill us?

228
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,249
Eh, we'll come back to that.

229
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:52,552
As young thinglings, we are schooled
in the wisdom of the universe.

230
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,208
Physics, mathematics, Fortran...

231
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,127
the greatest of the programming languages!

232
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,967
And now the part
that is difficult to tell you.

233
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,313
At the end of a life well-lived,

234
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,889
there is one final ritual.

235
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,885
-We must eat one of you.
-(all gasp)

236
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,858
But we'll let you have the fun
of picking which one.

237
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,069
(laughs)

238
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,650
There's only one fair solution.

239
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,236
-We have to put it to a vote.
-Before we vote,

240
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,241
I'd just like to point out in
<i>Sophie's Choice,</i> she saved the boy.

241
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,788
(humming a tune)

242
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,752
This isn't a happy thing!

243
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,042
Here you go.

244
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,586
Okay.

245
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,379
What the... D'oh!

246
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,223
Well, we haven't heard from Maggie yet.

247
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,719
Now, what the...

248
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,970
(scoffs) Gibberish, pure gibberish.

249
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,052
You're the last vote, Homie.

250
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,232
(groans)

251
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,976
'Tis a far, far better thing I do

252
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,975
than I have ever done before.

253
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,857
Hey, look,
Maggie made you a farewell card.

254
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,869
That kid's got talent, but come on!

255
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,330
Now do you see why I'm a vegetarian, Dad?

256
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,831
I get it, Lisa.

257
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,713
I finally get it.

258
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,420
You do get a last meal.

259
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,170
-I'd like rabbit, lots of rabbit.
-Ah.

260
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,764
{\an8}Welcome to the World Series of Chomping.

261
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,720
{\an8}This annual consumption ritual
is brought to you by scalp salt.

262

{\an8}From the same wonderful folks who make

263
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,559
{\an8}elbow pepper and groin gravy.

264
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,312
{\an8}Here comes sacrifice Homer Simpson.

265
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,774
{\an8}His hobbies include sitting, lying down,

266
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,065
{\an8}and reaching for things without success.

267
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,149
{\an8}Come on, folks,
let's put your eyelids together!

268
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,646
{\an8}(eyelids clapping)

269
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,662
{\an8}Doesn't your culture
say anything about mercy?

270
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,042
{\an8}Madam, you are speaking to the kindest

271
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,869
{\an8}and gentlest of us all.

272
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,035

{\an8}Our elder Klaunax has been chosen
for our ceremonial first bite,

276
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:08,096
{\an8}after which Homer Simpson will be dipped
into a spicy cheese fondue.

"Fondue"?

278
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,890
Welcome to a faculty dinner party
in 1979.

00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,807
Silence!
And celebrate the Solstice of Slobbering

A transporter beam!

Someone is trying to steal our sacrifice.

Way to go, George Mucus.

The fattest, stupidest man on Earth

298
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,282
slipped right through
your sticky tentacles.

00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,411
Why, you little...

300
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,695
What is this baffling construct?

301
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,203
-It's called a knot.
-A not what?

00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,116
-"Knot" with a "K."
-Ks are silent?

Really? I've been saying kitchen.

We are the resistance.

We don't believe in the barbaric
consumption of other species.

309
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,313
So, what do you eat-- space broccoli?

310
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,928
Space broccoli
has the most advanced feelings

311
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,636
of any creature in the universe.

312
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:39,516
I stepped on a piece once,

-Who are you talking about?
-Um, Earth broccoli.

Yeah, I hate those guys.
They think they're so big.

Unfortunately, we only had the means
to build the spaceship for one.

We spent most of our money on the party.

this trip has gotten interesting.

347
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,867
{\an8}(gasps)

348
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,004
{\an8}What the...

349
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,500
{\an8}Oh, who am I kidding?

350
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,252
{\an8}I couldn't enjoy calorie one
without my family.

351
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,174
{\an8}I'm going back to save them!

352
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,843
{\an8}Aw, if I could just live
inside that head,

353
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,763
{\an8}so full of noble thoughts.

354
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,604
<i>(growls, grunting)</i>

355
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,771
The golden rule states
if the chosen one escapes,

356
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,101
his family is eaten as forfeit.

357
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,557
What do your rules say now?

358
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,227
-That all will be eaten.
-D'oh!

359
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,105
This system is really rigged against us.

360
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,156
(Bart and Marge groan)

361
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,030
You forgot to glaze me.

362
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,947
No, I didn't. You licked it off!

363
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:03,036
I think somebody's afraid to admit
he's out of glaze.

364
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,923
(groans)

365
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,127
-Glaze, please.
-(growls)

366
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,218
Make way for the queen!

367
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,314
I shall take the first bite.

368
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,062
It is quite an honor.

369
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,734
(whimpering) What's that?

370
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,693
Part of your magnificent behind.

371
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,653
We sliced it off when you were sleeping.

372
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,573
It does look delicious.

373
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,374
(gasps) What is it, my queen?

374
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:45,083
This ass is most disagreeable.

375
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,575
(gurgles)

376
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:52,593
The creatures are composed
of completely indigestible toxins.

377
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,013
These humans have been poisoned

378
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,104
by their unhealthy fast-food diet.

379
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,180
Um, are you sure you don't want
to try me again?

380
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,147
You?
Your lunches of hummus and rice cakes

381
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,688
combine in your stomach to form
formaldehyde and animal fat.

382
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,193
Really? But I thought...

383
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,355
You'd be better off
chewing tobacco like the boy.

384
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,284
-What?!
-Dad said I could try it.

385
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,533
Homer!

386
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,914
Don't you people realize
your queen is dying?

387
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,913
{\an8}I'm afraid the lardo speaks the truth,
Your Majesty.

388
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,207
{\an8}It's all right.

389
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,920
{\an8}I have seen many glories
and have only one regret.

390
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,552
{\an8}That my breasts aren't bigger.

391
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,958
I don't see any breasts.

392
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:37,756
{\an8}And those will be the last words
I ever hear.

393
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,643
{\an8}(grunts)

394
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,140
Useless humans!

395
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:44,931
We will send you back to your planet,
and your memories will fade.

396
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,647
{\an8}So, it will be as if
none of this ever happened!

397
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:56,315
Captain's log, stardate 65848.2.

398
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,323
After successfully conquering
the Rigelians...

399
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,906
Right, "conquering."

400
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,781
Well, at least Maggie can fly us home.

401
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,038
Thank God it's just like her busy box.

402
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,923
{\an8}Well, I guess we've learned

403
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,500
{\an8}that of all the countless planets
in the universe,

404
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:16,376
{\an8}we have evolved into
the most inedible species.

405
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,675
Like three-bean salad at a barbecue,

406
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,139
we will remain untouched.

407
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,810
We're receiving a transmission
from an unknown source.

408
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,603
Hey, I finally tracked you down!

409
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,607
My oatmeal's gone cold.

410
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,519
<i>The cat ate my heart medicine.</i>

411
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,358
<i>-I'm engaged to my nurse...</i>
-Set a course, Mr. Maggie.

412
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,993
Anywhere but home.

413
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,002
{\an8}<i>HOMER: D'oh!</i>

414
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,369
{\an8}<i>(Star Trek </i>theme playing)
