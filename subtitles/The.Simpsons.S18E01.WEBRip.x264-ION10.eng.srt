His daddy putted bullets
in my daddy.

160

I’m not afraid of you.

178
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,697
Well, you shouldn’t be.

179
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,818
I’m not like my dad.

180
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:27,914
I understand.

181
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,369
I’m not like my dad either.

182
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,290
Oh.

183
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,542
(crunch)

184
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,082
Ew!
There’s a triple-A battery

185
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,247
in my macaroni and cheese!

186
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,375
It counts
as a vegetable.

187
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,423
I can’t eat this.

188
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,256
You know,
I cook a little.

189
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,011
Maybe I can make
you something.

190
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,973
All we need is some
fresh ingredients.

191
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,313
Well, you’re not going
to find any here.

192
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:00,560
(wind howling, ghost screaming)

193
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,396
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

194
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,652
get in the bowl.

195
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,653
Dandelion greens,
a sprig of wild dill,

196
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,988
fresh blackberry
juice for dressing.

197
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,907
It’s delicious!

198
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,164
Are you just
saying that

199
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,455
’cause you’re
afraid of my dad?

200
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,118
No, it’s great!

201
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,787
Ooh! Except for the bee!

202
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,342
It’s good
to see you laughing!

203
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,428
(car screeches to a halt)

204
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,089
You could make
a great chef someday.

205
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,428
(sighs):
My dad wants me to go
into the family business.

206
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,265
Which is, uh...

207
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,890
"waste management."

208
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,192
(grimly):
We are going for a ride.

209
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,732
(all scream)

210
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,525
By which I mean the carpool.

211
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,739
Perhaps we will get yogurt.

212
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,648
(all sigh in relief)

213
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,777
(grimly):
Now who wants to sleep
with the fishes?

214
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,945
Because I brought
this <i>Finding Nemo </i>bedspread.

215
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:56,865
(sigh in relief)

216
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,749
FAT TONY:
The Calabresis!

217
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,094
My archenemies
in waste management!

218
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,005
<i>♪ I woke up this morning ♪</i>

219
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,640
<i>♪ I got myself a gun. ♪</i>

220
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,894
Milhouse, may I borrow
your three-ring binder?

221
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,274
"Garfield" or "Love Is?"

222
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,352
Uh, I prefer the cat.

223
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,557
He hates Mondays.

224
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,567
We can all relate.

225
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,239
(all sigh)

226
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,486
(blaring horn)

227
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,043
-Eh.
-Not that bad.

228
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,005
BART AND LISA:
Mom!

229
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,339
I apologize for
my tardiness.

230
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,425
I "ran into" some
old acquaintances.

231
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,391
On the surface, that sounds
perfectly pleasant.

232
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,682
Papa, can Lisa and her family
come over for dinner?

233
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,846
We’d love to!

234
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,095
You know,
I’ve never met your wife.

235
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:09,437
Sadly, my Anna Maria was whacked
by natural causes.

236
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,395
Oh, you’re a widower.

237
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:15,486
I bring flowers to her
grave every Sunday.

238
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,953
Ooh, flowers every week!

239
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,695
I wish I was dead.

240
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,996
(doorbell rings)

241
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,422
Welcome to my home.

242
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,499
(gasps)

243
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,674
Must have cost
a fortune.

244
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,303
Actually, you can really
keep costs down

245
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,550
when you don’t pay
for materials or labor...

246
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,593
or permits...

247
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,545
or land.

248
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,346
Wow, your paintings
have brush marks.

249
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,599
(gasps)

250
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,930
And your statues have wieners!

251
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,766
Your words honor
my family.

252
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,732
In the words
of the old country:

253
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,942
<i>Mangiare, i miei amici!</i>

254
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,903
(chuckles):
He’s talkin’ like the guy
in <i>Fat Albert.</i>

255
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,324
(imitating Mushmouth):
Howba areba youba?

256
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,612
Homer!

257
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,776
D’oh!
(imitating Mushmouth):
Whyba youba doba thatba?

258
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:04,123
Boss, the Calabresis are
here for the sit-down.

259
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,498
The sit-down’s tonight?!

260
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,924
Again this Palm Pilot
has failed to remind me.

261
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,755
I believe this needs to be
hot-synced.

262
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:18,837
What are you doing?

263
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,098
I thought you meant

264
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,389
"hot-sync" it.

265
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,312
You know how it is with us--
everything means kill.

266
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,892
Sit-down item
number one:

267
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:30,977
your recent murderous overtures
with regard to my person.

268
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,315
We meant no disrespect,
Fat Tony.

269
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,781
We were simply trying
to kill you.

270
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,820
When we saw you driving
that carpool,

271
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,744
we figured you’d gone soft,
and were therefore whackable.

272
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,914
You’d be fools to kill me

273
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,912
for my son, Michael,
would take my place.

274
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:47,214
And wreak a terrible vengeance.

275
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,829
I made soufflés!

276
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,286
(oohs and aahs)

277
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:55,507
I’ve tried to make those, but
they always end up as brownies.

278
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,879
You said you <i>meant</i>
to make brownies.

279
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,258
Any other lies?

280
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,814
(chewing loudly)

281
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,098
Mm...

282
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,141
Oh, this must be
what angels taste like!

283
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,516
Oh, Michael,
one bite of this soufflé

284
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,574
and your father will realize
your gift deserves to flower.

285
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,074
Why can’t <i>you</i>
do anything?

286
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,618
So, we are at
peace once more.

287
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:27,081
Let us indulge in exaggerated
displays of affection!

288
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,043
This guy, I love him!

289
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,083
Get over here!

290
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,826
My brother,
over here!

291
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,877
You’re my everything,
over here!

292
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,921
You color my
world, over here!

293
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,835
Over here.
Over here, over here.

294
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,764
Papa, I brought
you some dessert.

295
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,928
(all chewing loudly)

296
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,397
My God, this is like
a lap dance for my taste buds!

297
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,979
Ah, yeah!

298
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,863
The flavor
just drove my sweet tooth

299
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,570
to a vacant lot
and whacked it.

300
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,320
Hey, kid, what bakery
did you boost these from?

301
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,117
Well, actually,
I made them.

302
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,737
Papa, I want to be a chef.

303
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,287
(laughter)

304
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,873
A chef, huh?

305
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,116
Hey, look what
we got here.

306
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,788
It’s Chef
Boy-ar-gay!

307
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,666
What’s he gonna do
if we rub you out,

308
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,673
serve our soup cold?

309
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,634
(laughter)

310
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,054
Well,
gazpacho is served cold.

311
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,133
So take that.

312
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,258
(laughter)

313
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,222
Hey, Tony,
catch you later.

314
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,727
Your kid’s got a
bright future--

315
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,979
catering
your funeral.

316
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,311
You know what I like?

317
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,185
Those little
baby hot dogs.

318
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,362
Do they small down big ones
or do they make ’em different?

319
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,365
Michael, you have
made me appear weak

320
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,290
in the eyes of my enemies.

321
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,699
Fat Tony, it’s
not important

322
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,618
what other people
think of you.

323
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:56,246
What matters is how
<i>you </i>feel inside.

324
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,261
(screams, groans)

325
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,510
Papa!

326
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,349
♪♪

327
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,685
Your father’s gonna be
absolutely fine

328
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,151
in about three months.

329
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,821
But for now, he can’t talk,
write, or blink.

330
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,190
(laughs)

331
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,237
With Fat Tony
doing the morphine mambo,

332
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,570
the Calabresis are gonna try
to put him down for a dirt nap.

333
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,736
Dirt nap, eh?

334
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,775
Hmm...

335
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,448
(snoring)

336
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,158
Homer,
our house is on fire!

337
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,788
-Help me save the children!
-(kids screaming)

338
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,835
Sorry, Marge,
can’t hear you!

339
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,418
(laughing)

340
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,671
What am I gonna do now?

341
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,837
Kid, the only way you’re
gonna live to grow shprazoot

342
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,846
on your abonjoola is if
you take your dad’s place.

343
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,139
Let’s go.

344
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,102
Hey, can we go by
the Lexus place?

345
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,182
I want to test drive
that new hybrid.

346
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,848
You are a hybrid:
half idiot, half moron.

347
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:57,857
Whoa!

348
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,268
Where did that come from?
Whoa!

349
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,187
I don’t know
what to do.

350
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,446
This is all
my daughter’s fault.

351
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,028
But I’ll make it up to you.

352
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,663
Bart and I will run your
business till your dad’s okay.

353
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,491
Well, what do you know
about being a mob boss?

354
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,907
Everything!

355
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,415
And I learned it all
from the greatest
gangster film ever:

356
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,628
<i>Shark Tale.</i>

357
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,537
This guy in here
owes us money.

358
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,338
Leave him to me.

359
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,672
Ow!

360
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,967
I hurt my fist and my palm.

361
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,591
I thought you guys
were looking out for me.

362
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,597
Ow!

363
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,308
(sobbing)

364
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,683
All right, tap jockey,

365
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,767
you owe Fat Tony 50 bucks.

366
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:36,891
Cough it up!

367
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,897
Look, Mister,
I-I don’t got the cash.

368
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,809
My clientele--
they’re all bums.

369
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,728
They never pay!

370
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:42,565
(grunts)

371
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,820
Just get the money!

372
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,447
Homer, the mob is putting
the screws on me, see.

373
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,241
I ain’t getting killed
’cause you won’t pay your tab.

374
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,906
Now give me 50 bucks!

375
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,584
(whimpering):
Take it, take it!

376
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,123
Just don’t hurt me!

377
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,417
Okay, pretty boy, where’s
Fat Tony’s 50 bucks?

378
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,132
Look, all-all I got is 25.

379
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,633
I swear! I swear!

380
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,054
It’ll do for now!

381
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,641
(humming)

382
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,024
(laughs nervously)

383
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,271
Hey, hey,
it’s Fat Tony’s crew!

384
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,903
How’s the big guy doing?

385
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,151
I sent flowers, but you
probably didn’t get them.

386
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,613
You know florists.
(chuckles)

387
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,533
Glug, glug.

388
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:31,161
Krusty, Fat Tony hasn’t
received his weekly payment

389
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,870
for keeping McDonald’s
and Burger King out of town.

390
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,201
Well, I’m a little short
this week.

391
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,706
Could I just pay you $5
to keep out Hardee’s?

392
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:41,956
-(punches landing)
<i>-KRUSTY: Ow!</i>

393
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,002
<i>My schnoz! My punim!</i>
<i>My pupik!</i>

394
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,086
(punches landing)

395
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,630
<i>My genechtagazoink!</i>

396
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,594
(Krusty groans)

397
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,255
(horn honking)

398
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,888
Homer, where’d you get
that truck?

399
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,270
Uh, it-it fell off a truck.

400
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,228
Uh, you know, a truck-truck.

401
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,058
(horn honking)

402
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,604
(tires screeching)

403
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,187
Where’d you get that?

404
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,442
Eh, it fell off
a truck-truck truck.

405
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,935
(horn honking)

406
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:09,948
(brakes squeal)

407
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:17,082
MARGE:
Homer, Helen Lovejoy never
returned my casserole dish

408
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,081
from the church potluck.

409
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,162
Could you pick it up?

410
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,366
No problem.

411
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,286
I’ll be back in ten minutes.

412
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,378
Hi-diddily-ho, mob-areenos!

413
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,176
(sighs)

414
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,968
I, uh...

415
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,432
I got your, uh, phone bill
in my mail by mistake,

416
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,312
and, uh...

417
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,179
I-I’ll just pay it.

418
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,727
(laughs)

419
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,100
(both laughing)

420
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,808
Dad, you want I should
plug him in the ankle?

421
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,068
You monster!

422
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,569
Just cut his Achilles tendon
with this knife.

423
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,651
(both laughing)

424
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:57,029
(both laughing)

425
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,705
(both laughing)

426
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,789
Bart, Mr. Simpson,

427
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,955
we are getting out of
the mob business, right now.

428
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,054
But this is
the only life I know!

429
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,589
I’m sorry.

430
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,552
I just can’t live with myself,
seeing you this way.

431
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,683
-Can I still talk with my hands?
-I’m afraid not.

432
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,761
-What about with my ears?
-No.

433
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,096
(groans softly)

434
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,096
My friends,
I surrender.

435
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,935
I’m handing over
all my father’s territory,

436
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,981
in exchange for the safety
of my family and the Simpsons.

437
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,356
Sorry.

438
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,992
We can only guarantee
<i>we </i>won’t hurt them.

439
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,529
Yeah.

440
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,362
You know, they’ve still got
to eat right and exercise.

441
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,407
Walk the dog
once in a while.

442
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,911
He’s a furry little
fitness machine.

443
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,162
Well said.

444
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,254
As for me, from now on,

445
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,249
my only business is cooking.

446
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,378
You did the right thing, Mikey.

447
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,761
You weren’t cut out
to be a wise guy.

448
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,089
But you, you got
a future in this business.

449
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,585
Call me.

450
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,967
Thanks, but I’m going
into bootleg DVDs.

451
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,684
(chuckling)

452
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,311
It’s so great that Michael’s
doing what he loves.

453
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,354
And I can stop
looking the other way

454
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,857
from what my husband’s doing.

455
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,229
Lady.

456
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,185
Man.

457
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,395
Lady.

458
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,784
Man.

459
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,151
(leeringly):
Lady.

460
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,777
(sighs)

461
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:21,366
(all grunting and choking)

462
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,871
(men groaning)

463
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,879
I want to be buried
next to my wife,

464
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,788
under that bridge in Jersey.

465
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,339
(sniffs, gasps)

466
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,591
Someone poisoned
these meatballs.

467
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,053
Homer?

468
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,803
Hey, if I poisoned them,
would I be doing this?

469
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,517
(groans)

470
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,600
This is a chef’s
worst nightmare.

471
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,346
I won’t be using
this recipe anymore.

472
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,775
Well done, my son.

473
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,748
In making peace
with our enemies,

474
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,248
you were able
to take them down.

475
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,831
Perhaps you and I are not
so different after all.

476
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,998
Papa, I’m just
glad you’re okay.

477
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,336
Now get some rest.

478
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,585
Why didn’t you tell him
it was an accident?

479
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,296
It was an accident, right?

480
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,926
Michael?

481
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,723
Don’t <i>ever </i>ask me
about my business, Lisa.

482
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,018
Michael?

483
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,159
Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!

484
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,326
MICHAEL:
Vroom! Vroom!

485
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,086

engine noises)
