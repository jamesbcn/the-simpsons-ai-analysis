How you doing there?

00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,608
{\an8}Wow, he threw us under the bus,

58
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,617
{\an8}and now he's sitting
in the bus driver's lap.

59
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,699
{\an8}Now, Simpson,
how is it that you alone

60
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,954
{\an8}managed to keep your moral compass
pointed to true north?

61
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,077
{\an8}Well, sir, before
I do anything,

62
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,165
{\an8}I stop and ask myself:

63
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,130
{\an8}"What would Jesus
and Mr. Burns do?"

64
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,131
{\an8}You are garbage made flesh!

65
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,383
{\an8}This is a mockery!

66
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:56,434
{\an8}Hush! Now, while Simpson
gets the day off,

67
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,639
{\an8}the rest of you will write
30-page essays entitled

{\an8}"Homer Simpson:
Moral Lodestar."

69

Can we have fun with it?

70
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,273
{\an8}No, you may not.

all your friends in trouble

79
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,449
{\an8}and you got the day off!

80
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,867
{\an8}Hey, it's called karma.

81
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,960
{\an8}Isn't karma where if
you do something bad,

82
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,633
{\an8}bad things happen to you?

83
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,631
{\an8}(chuckles)
A common misconception.

84
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,178

85

Ah, nothing better
than a lazy Saturday morning

lying in a warm, moist bed,

91
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,271
because weekends are...

92
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,778
Moist?!

93
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,569

Marge, from time to time
I've heard you speak

98
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,589
of a "washing machine."

99
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,839
Where would I find
this marvelous contraption?

100
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,671
Why? Are you going
to do the laundry?

101
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,338
Not just the laundry.
That would be weird,

102
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,887
and you might ask questions.

103
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,681

00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,642
(screaming)

355
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,481
(shrieks) Quick!

356
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,066
Gum up the gears with Moes.

357
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,282
Hey, you know what's good for
cleaning Moe gunk

358
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,406
out of your gears?

359
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,912
White vinegar. Yeah.

360
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:53,993
(screaming)

361
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,839
(slow-motion grunting)

362
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,760
(slow-motion)
Glayyyviiin!

363
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,387
Uh, we're gonna be here
a long time.

364
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:17,689
(slow-motion)
Oh, the maaaachiiine...

365
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,067
(yelling)

366
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,027
Oh, Death, you're a lifesaver.

367
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:40,668
Thank you, Death.

368
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,749
I am not...

369
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,835
Death.

370
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,879
-Mom?!
-KIDS: Gramma!

371
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,763
Mona, you're alive?

372
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,760
No, but I live on
in Homer's dreams.

373
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,803
Just like my hair.

374
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,926
That's Jennifer Aniston's hair
on <i>Friends.</i>

375
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,765
Exactly like Chandler,
always criticizing.

376
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,852
Now, I have something
to show you.

377
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:05,357
Something that just might
help Homer wake up dry.

378
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,936
HOMER: Wow!

379
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,358
Roomy.

380
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,615
(film projector whirring)

381
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,790
While you boys are out
playing in the boat,

382
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,079
I'll go to the store
and pick us up some dinner.

383
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,293
No need.
With two Simpson men in the boat,

384
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,133
we'll bring you back
a pile of fish.

385
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,129
I'm in charge of the tackle box.

386
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,722
What...?
(choking)

387
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,878
(laughs)
And we're off.

388
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,887
(choking)
Good-bye!

389
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:37,099
(laughs) Man, Homer,
you've always been a loser.

390
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,471
Why you little...!

391
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,227
There's nothing in this dream world
that can't strangle you!

392
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:47,475
Um, I heard you and Mommy
yelling again last night.

393
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,436
Oh, no, no.

394
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,356
It was just a TV show.

395
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,655
Mitch Miller was yelling
at one of his idiot singers.

396
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,200
You just concentrate
on catching the fish

397
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,204
and not whether there'll be
someone there to cook it.

398
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,747
I got a bite!

399
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,500
We got a fish!
We got a fish!

400
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,332
All right, settle down there, boy.

401
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,127
After we eat it,
can we let it go?

402
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,751
Can we catch a submarine?

403
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,127
(both scream)

404
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,796
<i>MONA: You got home hours late</i>
<i>with no fish.</i>

405
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,385
{\an8}It was only a few weeks later

406
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,140
{\an8}that I left your father for good.

407
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,432
You left him because
I tipped the boat over

408
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,057
and ruined the vacation?

409
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,233
Pathetic.

410
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,981
A kid who can't keep
his parents' marriage together

411
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,483
is no kid at all.

412
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:31,404
It's true! I failed the basic
duty of childhood.

413
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,065
(gasps) And then when
I took Bart fishing,

414
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:37,284
it all came back, and the guilt
made me wet the bed.

415
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,156
Case closed.
Mm-hmm.

416
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,044
Now, let's return
our dream skis.

417
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,871
-Case not closed.
-Hmm?

418
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,626
Homer, you have nothing
to feel guilty about,

419
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,338
and I can show you.
Roll the film, Cletus.

420
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,959
"Roll the film, Cletus."

421
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,126
"Kiss me, Cletus."

422
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,384
Whatever you say, boss lady.

423
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,299
Sorry, Mona.

424
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,176
We had more of an adventure
than we planned on.

425
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,644
It's okay, Abe.

426
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,433
You brought back
the only treasure I care about.

427
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:09,019
And when the time came that
I had to leave your father,

428
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,276
I knew you were
in good hands.

429
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,358
I'm cured!
I'll never wet the bed again.

430
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,494
And maybe you'll stop
overeating, too.

431
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,952
No can do, baby.

432
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,781
(loud rumbling)

433
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,198
And never forget, Homer:

434
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:27,207
the three of us will always be together,
in your memory.

435
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,251
Right next to the movie trivia.

436
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,174
Stanley Kubrick
wanted Robin Williams

437
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,343
to star in <i>The Shining.</i>

438
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:36,181
<i>Casablanca</i> was originally
going to star Ronald Reagan.

439
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,338
There was a <i>Grease 2,</i>
and I wasn't in it.

440
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,927
Whoa! Hey, watch it!

441
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,762
-There you go again.
-Shazbot!

442
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,057
And now you'd better run along,
sweetheart.

443
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,732
Good-bye.

444
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,523
Hmm?

445
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,567
Hmm?

446
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,229
Huh?

447
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,358
(mumbles)

448
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,155
(grunts)

449
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,988
(gasping)

450
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,914
Whoo-hoo! I'm dry!

451
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:06,043
Come on, everybody,
feel Daddy's underpants!

452
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,581
We'll take your word for it.

453
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,329
So what do I do again?

454
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,537
Spin the top.

455
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,797
If it falls over,
we're in reality.

456
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,509
If it spins forever,
we're still in a dream.

457
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,590
All right.

458
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,387
Look at it go!

459
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,890
All right!

460
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,391
Hey, since it's a dream,

461
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,603
let's ride our bikes naked
around town.

462
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,393
Sounds like a plan.

463
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,187
(both laughing)

464
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,984
MARGE:
Is that hail coming down?

465
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,278
HOMER:
It's just dream hail.

466
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,741
Ow! Ooh! Ow!

467
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,660
Dream hail!
(screaming)

468
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,029
Hey, there's a dream truck.

469
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,405
-(thuds)
-Ow!
