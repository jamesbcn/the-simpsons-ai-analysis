00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,804
This stupid country.

182
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,575
Ow!

183
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,793
Hey, I was watching that
and I was sitting there.

184
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,495
Rex Banner. I'm running
this department now.

185
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,626
Wiggum, you're out--

186
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,052
suspended indefinitely.

187
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,050
Huh?

188
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,341
Tuck in that shirt!

189
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,545
Get those shoes shined!

190
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,925
Take that badge out
of your mouth!

191
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,011
You're police officers.

192
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,305
What are you
waiting for--

193
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,139
somebody to kiss you
good-bye?

194
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,055
Well...

195
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,653
no, no, no.
I guess not.

196
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,444
NARRATOR:
<i>Wasting no time,</i>

197
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,986
<i>Rex Banner tore into</i>
<i>the bootleggers</i>

198
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,449
<i>like a chippie tearing</i>
<i>into a lobster.</i>

199
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,569
(tires screeching)

200
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,164
(rapid gunfire)

201
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,959
How do you know
you don't like bribes

202
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,669
if you've never
taken one? Here.

203
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,880
Say, this is nice.

204
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,382
No! No bribes!

205
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,803
Okay, you win.

206
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,431
From now on, we'll stick
to smuggling heroin.

207
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,509
See that you do!

208
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,393
At first,
I thought prohibition

209
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,970
was a good thing.

210
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,635
People were drinking more
and having a lot more fun.

211
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,394
But without beer,
prohibition doesn't work.

212
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,017
Hey, hi.

213
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,524
Can I arrest any of you people
for anything?

214
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,935
-No.
-Ah, geez.

215
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,693
I don't have
anything to do anymore.

216
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,106
With Banner around,

217
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,824
alcohol and crime
are history in this town,

218
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,905
and so am I.

219
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,870
Now, don't say that!

220
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,910
Alcohol is a way of life.

221
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,754
Alcohol is my way of life,

222
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,619
and I aim to keep it.

223
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,496
Sounds like
you have a plan.

224
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,633
Maybe I do, chief.

225
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,800
Maybe I do.

226
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,759
Come on, boy.
Think of a plan.

227
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,510
I'm trying, Dad.

233
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,813
I've got it!

234
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,312
We're going out, Marge.

235
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,234
If we don't come back,
avenge our deaths.

236
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,233
MARGE: All right.

237
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,531
BART: Whoa, bonanza!

238
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,610
Let's load it up
before the rats regroup.

239
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,815
Right. Now remember:

240
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,744
Don't mention
this to anyone--

241
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,413
not your mother,
not Rex Banner,

242
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,412
not anyone.

243
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,799
(scoffs) Rex Banner--
what a dope.

244
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,841
Yeah. Look at him trying
to aim that stupid gun.

245
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:35,835
(both scream)

246
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,756
(siren wailing)

247
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,095
Hang on, son!

248
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,687
Dad, knocking over
a gravestone is bad luck.

249
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,560
Really?
I heard good.

250
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,742
What happened
to you, Homer?

251
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,282
And what have
you done to the car?

252
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,776
Nothin'.

253
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,657
I don't think it had
broken axles before.

254
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,945
Before! Before!

255
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,748
You're livin'
in the past, Marge.

256
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:06,751
Quit livin' in the past.

257
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,382
That's funny.

258
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,922
I used to be able
to go down there.

259
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,684
Going bowling.
Not back, avenge deaths.

260
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,640
Why do you have
so many bowling balls?

261
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,060
Uh...

262
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,308
I'm not gonna lie
to you, Marge.

263
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,641
So long!

264
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,935
(door closes)

265
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,148
(car speeding away)

266
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,309
(growls)

267
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,655
Ah, rats!
Another gutter ball!

268
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,068
Gee, Homer
you sure do suck tonight.

269
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,327
Yeah, suck like a fox!

270
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,540
(both laughing)

271
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,520
Here you go, barn.
That'll be 45 bucks.

272
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,678
45 bucks?!

273
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,937
Well, this better be the
best-tasting beer in the world.

274
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,651
You got lucky.

275
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,700
You see, boy, the real money
is in bootlegging,

276
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,833
not in your
childish vandalism.

277
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,500
Oh, so many
wasted nights.

278
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,329
What's the matter,
chief?

279
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,457
Yeah, you've barely touched
your Banana Kaboom.

280
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,717
This isn't a very
happy birthday for Rex Banner.

281
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,640
(Barney mumbling)

282
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,640
Hello, fishies!

283
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,726
(belches)

284
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,400
(screaming)

285
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,559
Listen, rummy, I'm going
to say it plain and simple:

286
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,977
Where'd you
pinch the hooch?

287
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,775
Is some blind tiger
jerking suds on the side?

288
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,200
Yes?

289
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,406
Wait a minute.

290
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,490
I forgot to make sure
the coast was clear.

291
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,036
Ah, it's probably clear.
Let's go.

292
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,830
(yelps)

293
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:10,924
Beer!

294
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:11,918
I can explain, Marge.

295
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,419
Please let me explain.

296
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,301
(wailing) Oh, why won't
let me explain?!

297
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,258
You're the one the papers
have been talking about--

298
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,129
that mysterious "beer baron"

299
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,086
who's been supplying Springfield
with alcohol.

300
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,546
How have you been
getting away with this?

301
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,757
Well... and I can
explain, remember?

302
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,227
I fill the balls with beer
that I found at the dump

303
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,138
and then I bowl them
and some underground pipes

304
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,227
take them into Moe's.

305
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,311
Homer, that's very clever.

306
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,226
-Huh?
-Mom!

307
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,815
Well, it is. I've known your father
since high school,

308
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,611
and this is the cleverest
things he's ever done.

309
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,324
Besides, he's only breaking
a silly, 200-year-old law.

310
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,865
It is silly, Marge.

311
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,369
And look at all the
money I'm making.

312
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,120
Whoo!

313
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,962
Mom! Prohibition
may be unpopular,

314
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,038
but it's the law,
and we still have--

315
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,293
ALL:
Go to your room, Lisa.

316
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,091
(pounding on door)

317
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,469
Open up, curly.

318
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,840
This is a raid.

319
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,926
A raid?!
Curly?!

320
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,101
Um, all right, but, uh...

321
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,141
I don't know what you
expect to find

322
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:16,856
in a, uh, simple, uh...
neighborhood... pet shop.

323
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,357
Pet shop, eh?

324
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,155
Well, I just have
one question:

325
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,449
What kind of pet shop

326
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,162
is filled with
rambunctious yahoos

327
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,082
and hot jazz music
at 1:00 a.m.?

328
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,540
Um...

329
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,330
uh...

330
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,285
the... best... damn...
pet shop in town!

331
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,126
PATRONS: Yeah!

332
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,171
All right,

333
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,554
but you people remember:

334
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,590
Baby turtles and alligators

335
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,934
may seem like a cute idea
for a pet,

336
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,430
but they grow up.

337
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,551
Let's go, boys.

338
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,440
Ow!

339
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,440
Those gears down there
really hurt.

340
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,236
You're out there somewhere,
beer baron,

341
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,531
and I'll find you.

342

No, you won't.

00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,677
All the beer from the landfill
is gone, beer baron.

356
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,888
We're out of business.

357
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,112
But I can't be out of beer.

358
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,899
I'm the beer baron.

359
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,073
Homer, my customers
are sobering up,

360
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,072
and they ain't gonna
stick around for the ambiance.

361
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,864
You got to get me more beer.

362
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,278
Sorry. I'm all out.

363
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,326
How about some turpentine
or caulk?

364
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,789
Delicious caulk.

365
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,869
Look, find it, buy it,
make it, I don't care.

366
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,365
Just get me some booze
and fast.

367
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,997
Make it, eh?

368
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,921
Forty-two bathtubs, please.

369
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,304
You know, they're 50
for $3,000 today.

370
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,382
I said 42!

371
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,516
Now you're making
your own alcohol?

372
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,190
That's more illegal than
what you were doing before.

373
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,609
(laughing)
Remember, honey,

374
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,359
we're disobeying
an unjust law here.

375
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,030
We're patriots.

376
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,949
Like...
all those people in jail.

377
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,783
(cheering)

378
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,000
(sniffing)

379
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,670
Who wants a bathtub mint julep?

380
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,085
Are you the beer baron?

381
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,683
If you're talking
about root beer,

382
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:53,098
I plead guilt-didilly-ilty
as char-didilly-arged.

383
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,098
He's not the baron,
but he sounds drunk.

384
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,600
Take him in.

385
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,305
Are you the beer baron?

386
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,893
Yes, but only by night.

387
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,688
By day,
I'm a mild-mannered reporter

388
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,401
for a major metropolitan
newspaper.

389
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,481
Don't crack wise
with me, tubby.

390
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,737
Tubby?

391
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,238
Oh, yes, tubby.

392
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,700
Hey, Banner,
how's it hanging?

393
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,200
None of your business.

394
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,540
(rumbling)

395
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,330
(both screaming)

396
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,206
What on earth happened
down there?!

397
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,923
One of the stills--

398
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,463
Uh, nothing, Marge.

399
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,216
I think it must have been
that bean I had for dinner.

400
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,929
(explosions)

401
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,550
Ka-boom! Blam!

402
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,346
Oh, excuse me again, dear.

403
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,430
Homer, there's no point
in pretending

404
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,225
you're making those noises.

405
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,769
Your homemade liquor
is exploding again.

406
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,693
What, dear? Ka-blammo!

407
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,982
You made some money

408
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,145
and had the fun of being
a wanted criminal.

409
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,653
Why not quit now
while you're ahead?

410
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,606
-(explosion)
-Boom.

411
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,202
I'll be right back.

412
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,203
(rumbling)

413
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,206
(loud explosion)

414
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,868
(screaming)

415
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,787
It's hot! Oh!

416
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,206
Oh! Oh! Oh!

417
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,256
Whoo.

418
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,050
I've thought about
what you said, honey,

419
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,054
and I've decided to quit.

420
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,466
Oh, well, fun's over.

421
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,885
But I still have
my wonderful money.

422
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,434
Stick 'em up!

423
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,058
Geez, what happened to you,
Wiggum? You look terrible.

424
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,435
Never mind how I look.

425
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,942
You gonna give me
the money or not?

426
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,363
Well, I don't think so.

427
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,321
You don't even have
a trigger on that thing.

428
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,241
Yeah, I had to sell the trigger
and most of the handle

429
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,780
to feed my family.

430
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,993
Come on, give me the dough.

431
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,243
I can throw this pretty hard.

432
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,075
Poor Wiggum.

433
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,410
Poor Wiggum.

434
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,615
I'll bet you really hate
Rex Banner, huh?

435
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,915
Um... who?

436
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,458
The guy who took your job.

437
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,502
Oh, yeah.

438
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,384
More than anything in the world.

439
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,341
Hey, how would you
like to show him up

440
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,262
by beating him
at his own game?

441
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,933
(cheering)

442
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,511
I'm happy to report

443
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,426
that the flow of illegal liquor
seems to have dried up.

444
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,886
Public drunkenness has ceased

445
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,266
and those
mysterious liquor clouds

446
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,522
over Evergreen Terrace
are gone.

447
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:11,284
People, Rex Banner has won
your war against alcohol.

448
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,858
(cheering)

449
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,443
What about
the beer baron?

450
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,198
I suspect he was just
an invention of the media.

451
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,661
The idea that someone like that

452
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,870
could operate under my very nose
is laughable.

453
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,912
(gasping)

454
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,615
(gagging)

455
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,380
Well, you all know
what laughter sounds like.

456
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,248
We now go live
to Evergreen Terrace

457
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,915
where I'm informed

458
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,304
that former police chief Wiggum
has captured the beer baron.

459
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,342
(gasping)

460
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,335
They captured Homer?

461
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,469
Then the liquor-filled
bowling balls traveled

462
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,465
through a network
of underground pipes

463
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,637
finally emerging
at a nearby speakeasy.

464
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,517
You forgot
one thing, Wiggum.

465
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,774
Yeah? What's that?

466
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,815
I filled the balls
with a funnel.

467
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,070
That was a very sweet thing
you did for poor Wiggum.

468
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,824
But what's going
to happen to you?

469
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,526
Oh, probably
just a slap on the wrist.

470
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,447
"And he who shall
violate this law

471
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,576
shall be punished
by catapult."

472
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,213
(grunting)

473
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,420
Last time I help you.

474
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,459
Sorry. I thought
you'd get a fine

475
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,253
or at most,
three, four years in jail.

476
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,547
BANNER: Hold it.

477
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,800
This machine
is two centuries old.

478
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:17,802
Better test it first.

479
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,179
(yowling)

480
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,813
Okay. Go ahead.

481
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,520
Wait! Wait!
You can't do this!

482
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,021
All my husband did was violate
a law that doesn't make sense.

483
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,654
Now, I'll admit

484
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,531
car crashes and fistfights
have been down recently,

485
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,399
but prohibition
has cost us our freedom--

486
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,107
our freedom to drink.

487
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,948
Now hold on
a minute, missy.

488
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,413
It's not up to us to choose
which laws we want to obey.

489
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:49,004
If it were, I'd kill everyone
who looked at me cockeyed.

490
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,381
Our laws are in place
for a reason.

491
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,208
Send him back
to mama, boys.

492
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,093
(yelling)

493
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,297
That was unexpected.

494
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,843
Well, reset the catapult,
and let's get this over with.

495
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,428
CLERK: Wait.

496
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,933
I've discovered more lines
on the parchment.

497
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,555
It says that
the prohibition law

498
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,153
which was passed here
200 years ago

499
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:16,439
was repealed 199 years ago.

500
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,605
Release the prisoner.

501
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,202
On behalf of the city,
I'd like to apologize

502
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,032
and ask how long
it will take for you

503
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,077
to flood this town
with booze again.

504
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,200
Well, sorry.

505
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,998
I'm not in
that business anymore.

506
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,331
Four minutes.
