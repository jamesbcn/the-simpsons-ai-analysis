{\an8}Stop that sniffing.

{\an8}They're making the house

A lot of people sound

127
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,109
Like Frasier on <i>Cheers.</i>

Or Frasier on <i>Frasier.</i>

129
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,453
Or Lieutenant Commander
Tom Dodge in <i>Down Periscope.</i>

130
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,911
Look, I'm telling you,
no matter who he says he is,

131
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,742
he's really Sideshow Bob.

132

Honey, his name
is Walt Warren,

133

and he's a very nice man.

134
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,747
He stopped me from driving away

135
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,923

on top of the car.

136
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,302
Ah.

137
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,959
Really? Hmm.

138
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,587
Maybe I...

139
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,013

140
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,223

142
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,771
Stupid kid,
fooled by a silhouette.

143
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,440
(gasps) Ooh.

144
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,650
Eh... (gasps)

145
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,693
Ice cream?

146
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:46,283
Oh, nothing is ever boobs
or ice cream.

147
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,698
I'll prove
I'm not crazy.

148
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,246
Sideshow Bob could never
resist singing along

149
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,120
to a Gilbert and
Sullivan operetta.

Morning Cattle Drive

172

in the afternoon.

173
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,759

174
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,931

Shut up.

177
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,984
I just want to say, I've
not only found new neighbors,

178
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,809
but gained new friends.

179
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:03,725
And from now on, Wi-Fi
in this neighborhood is on me.

180
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,526
(all gasp)

181
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,360
Ooh, that book I ordered
is gonna be delayed.

182
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,531
(grunts)

183
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,697
All right, Walt Warren.

184
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,124
Let's see who you really are.

185
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,334
<i>Harmless World,</i>

186
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,793
<i>Mild Manners,</i>

187
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,083
<i>Not Mad Magazine,</i>

188
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,326
<i>Nap Fancy,</i>

189
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,957
<i>Calm, Comfortable,</i>

190
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,594
a "Cuddly Puppies" calendar.

191
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,630
Aw, little guy can't get out
of the pumpkin.

192
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,005
(grumbles)
There must be something here.

193
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:33,102
Something, something, something.

194
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,099
-MARGE: Bart?
-(startled shout)

195
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,220
What are you doing?

196
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,966
You're indoors at
an outdoor party.

197
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,768
Walt is Sideshow Bob,

198
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:39,941
and I'm gonna prove it.

199
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,059
Look.
Who needs a knife this big?

200
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,686
It's probably a deboner.

201
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,034
(chuckles) Boner.

202
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,989
-Mom, I'm scared.
-(groans)

203
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,530
I can see there's only one way
to settle this once and for all.

204
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,830
Okay ma'am, Sideshow Bob's cell

205
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,502
is all the way
at the end.

206
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,330
Walk fast and don't call
attention to yourself.

207
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,206
Pretty lady in a strapless dress
coming through!

208
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,214
-Oh, yeah!
-Come here, woman!

209
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,087
If you were my wife,
I never would've killed you!

210
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,054
Thank you.
You're very sweet.

211
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,224
Nothing is holding up
the dress!

212
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,643
Only her melons!

213
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,932
And here we are.

214
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,766
Sideshow Bob.

215
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,351
(gasps)

216
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,896
(grunts)
I can't see.

217
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,481
Oh, here you go.

218
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,356
Huh?

219
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,151
BART: That <i>is </i>Bob.

220
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,735
Guess I was wrong.

221
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,700
(gibbering)

222
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,701
We better go.

223
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,833
Pretty lady coming back!

224
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,290
Aw, yeah... yeah!

225
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,210
-Come here, baby.
-Walkin'...

226
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,919
Guys, guys, I'm married.

227
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
-You are?
-So sorry.

228
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,005
(gagging)

229
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,095
(gasps)

230
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,023
(electrical buzzing)

231
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,692
(siren wailing)

232
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,107
(dogs barking)

233
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,625
(snoring, muttering)

234
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,468
Great day to be alive.

235
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,144
Ah, the paper's here.

236
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,813
-Morning, Marge.
-(screams)

237
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,892
Hope I didn't interrupt
your <i>petite dejeuner.</i>

238
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,597
Look, I feel terrible
that Bart and I

239
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,267
got off on the
wrong foot,

240
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,686
and I have an extra ticket
to today's baseball game.

241
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,225
Bart, care to come?

242
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,448
They're playing
Spokane.

243
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,778
The Cascades?

244
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,573
They totally stole the
Federal Cup from us last year.

245
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,698
Can I go, Mom? Can I?

246
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,454
-Is your room clean?
-No.

247
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,945
Good. That'll give me
something to do

248
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,497
while you're at the game.

249
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,798
Marge, the bathroom
scale is lying again.

250
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,641
(screaming)

251
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,184
All right, buddy,
I'm gonna do to you

252
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:25,184
what you should have done
to my son a long time ago.

253
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,767
(high-pitched voice):
I'm not Sideshow Bob.

254
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,942
I'm the real Walt Warren.

255
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,151
But that's impossible.

256
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,112
If you're the
real Walt Warren,

257
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,702
who's taking our son to the
baseball game right now?

258
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,994
Uh, you missed the turn-off,
Mr. Warren.

259
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,244
You don't have to call
me Mr. Warren anymore.

260
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,786
You see, Bart,
you were right all along.

261
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,035
I am... Sideshow Bob.

262
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,206
-(screaming)
-(evil laughter)

263
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,014
And now I am free to sing

264
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,129
all the Gilbert and Sullivan
I damn well please.

265
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:02,137
<i>♪ Behold the lord</i>
<i>high executioner ♪</i>

266
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,971

267
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,137
(humming tune)

268
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,151
Hmm...

269
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,236
Hmm...?

270
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,156
I'll prove I'm
telling the truth.

271
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,700
Bob has huge feet, right?

272
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,623
Well, look...

273
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,371
You see?

274
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,624
(all gasping)

275
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,075
It's like you're
a Chinese empress.

276
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,456
You see, I was Bob's cellmate.

277
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,053
My new cellmate, Walt Warren,

278
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,919
was the perfect
candidate for my plan.

279
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,796
He had the same build as me--

280
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,763
lacking only my regal
bearing and leonine grace.

281
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:48,175
As a minor offender, he was
scheduled for early release.

282
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,404
Say, Bob, why do you
keep measuring my face?

283
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,316
Just passing the time, bunky.

284
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,624
Well, I guess it beats
what the last guy did.

285
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,739
Well, nighty-night.

286
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,116
And nighty-night to you.

287
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:09,794
(grunts)

288
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,672
(thunder crashing)

289
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,801
SIDESHOW BOB:
<i>I began by removing</i>
<i>Walt's face.</i>

290
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,932
(blows)
Five-second rule.

291
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,720
<i>That was the easy part.</i>

292
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,104
<i>The hard part was</i>
<i>removing my own face.</i>

293
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:31,811
<i>Luckily, as Krusty's sidekick,</i>
<i>I'd been hit with so many pies</i>

294
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,194
<i>that my face had lost</i>
<i>all sensation.</i>

295
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,401
(screams in pain)

296
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,651
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

297
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,902
(screaming)

298
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,197
(thunder crashing)

299
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:48,542
<i>The final reattachment</i>
<i>was a mere bagatelle.</i>

300
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,159
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

301
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,616
(sighs)

302
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,878
<i>They returned Walt's</i>
<i>possessions to me.</i>

303
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,000
Keys, cell phone,

304
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,047
$143,000.

305
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,340
Oh!

306
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,223
It was only $27,000
when you came in,

307
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,800
but, uh, we invested it well.

308
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,095
-Would you like a commission?
-Not allowed.

309
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,559
<i>And I walked out</i>
<i>free as a bird.</i>

310
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,727
I bought the house next
to you, and here we are.

311
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,725
So I just have to kill
you, then sell the house.

312
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,738
Selling the house
will be murder.

313
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,530
You could just rent it
till the market recovers...

314
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,284
which'll be never.

315
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,826
(evil laughter)

316
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,872
Walt, why didn't you tell
your story to the guards?

317
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,167
Well, I tried to, but I had
trouble moving my new lips.

318
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,802
They heard me babbling,

319
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:44,049
thought I was crazy,
and threw me into a padded cell.

320
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,553
<i>I tried to warn you by writing</i>
<i>"Bart Simpson will die"</i>

321
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,806
<i>on the walls,</i>
<i>but you ignored me.</i>

322
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,809
You have to admit,
"Bart Simpson Will Die"

323
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,892
was kind of open
to interpretation.

324
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,437
I'm not a writer.

325
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,320
And I'm not a locksmith.

326
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,656
Man, that dude
does not like Bart.

327
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,333
(gasps) I know where
Bob's taking Bart.

328
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,168
(muffled yelling)

329
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,377
Another cup of
coffee, handsome?

330
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,876
It's on the house.

331
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,847
Well, that's kind of you, Joyce,
but caffeine makes me jittery,

332
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,849
and I have a task ahead of me
which requires a firm hand.

333
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,852
Ooh, I like a man
with a firm hand.

334
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,856
Hey, looks like you've got a
loose thread on your collar.

335
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,189
No, don't.

336
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,823
(screams)

337
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,570
My face. My beautiful,
borrowed face.

338
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,950
Come back!

339
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,953
I don't care
if you don't have a face.

340
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,825
I just need something warm
to cuddle at night!

341
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:59,083
Excuse me.
Have you seen this man?

342
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,666
Yeah, I've seen him.

343
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,841
He, uh, said
he was driving down to Mexico.

344
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:04,921
Mexico?

345
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,045
<i>Ándale! Ándale!</i>

346
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,011
<i>Arriba!</i>

347
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,091
I don't believe her.

348
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,545
I think she fell in love
with my face,

349
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,546
and she's trying
to throw us off the scent.

350
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,218
Walt, it's a nice face,

351
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:19,267
but I don't think it would drive
a professional waitress to lie.

352
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,733
Well, fine. You go to Mexico.

353
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,613
I'm going to Five Corners.

354
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,150
Hey, handsome.

355
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,025
Is that a loose
thread on your collar?

356
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,702
(groaning)

357
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,910
All the good men are either gay
or have no face.

358
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,826
Welcome to the
Five Corners,

359
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,206
the only geographic
location in the U.S.

360
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,633
where five states meet,

361
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,342
and where
you will meet your doom.

362
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,803
Come on, Bob.

363
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,472
You don't need
to kill me.

364
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,841
I'll probably
kill myself pretty soon

365
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,797
with all
the stupid things I do.

366
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,717
Oh, no!
I swallowed my tongue!

367
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,016
(gagging)

368
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,555
Yes, I would
be a fool.

369
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,935
Unless I did it here,

370
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,032
where your murder
will be unprosecutable.

371
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,321
You know, the great ones
can kill without explaining.

372
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,244
I can stand in one state,
fire a gun in a second state.

373
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:16,083
<i>The bullet will travel through</i>
<i>the third, hitting you</i>

374
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,750
<i>in the fourth</i>
<i>so you fall dead in the fifth.</i>

375
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,658
No single act
is against any law.

376
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,577
But their sum total
is the greatest murder

377
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,706
since Snape killed Dumbledore.

378
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,714
Oh, I haven't gotten
to that part yet.

379
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,256
It's a four-year-old book.

380
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,129
I'm a slow reader.

381
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,756
A fitting epitaph.

382
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,891
(sighs)
It means last words.

383
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,851
Are you here
to teach me, or to kill me?

384
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,641
What in the name of Malcolm
Muggeridge are you doing?

385
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,518
Ruining your plan.
If you shoot me

386
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,065
while we're in the same state,
you go to jail.

387
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,819
(grunting
with each step)

388
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,074
Oh! (mutters)

389
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,786
Fine. I'll just shoot you,
and tell people I did the plan.

390
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,328
(grunts)

391
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,412
Not today, Bob.

392
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,628
See, Bob, even you
hate to see you.

393
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:08,048
Now Bob, you take my face off
nice and easy

394
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,878
and kick it over here.

395
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,085
Oh! There's a bee
under my cheek!

396
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,845
Hey! Hey, no!

397
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,522
Help us! Help us!
For the love of God,

398
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,979
won't somebody help us?

399
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,439
<i>-Sí.</i>
-Uh, yes,
I'd like... um...

400
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,980
-How do you say taco
in Mexican?
-Taco.

401
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,074
-Yes, that's exactly the word
I want to translate.
-Taco.

402
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,780
-Homer, can we please find Bart?
-Oh, yeah, yeah, right.

403
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,071
Uh, just give me one of those
crispy shells with meat in it.

404
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,695
-Taco?
-Oh!

405
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,995
Walt, because
I like your face,

406
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,291
I'll let you decide
which state I kill you in.

407
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,375
Okay, uh... Hawaii.

408
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,210
Choosing privilege revoked.

409
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,625
Hold it right there,
Switches of Eastface.

410
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,215
Switches
of Eastface?

411
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,640
I don't want
to censor myself.

412
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,798
That's how creativity dies.

413
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,677
Aah! Blasted Wiggum!
How did you find us?

414
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:05,135
You see, Bob, Bart was never
convinced you were Walt.

415
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,977
<i>So before he left for the game,</i>

416
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,572
<i>he called us and warned us</i>
<i>to track you.</i>

417
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,608
<i>Which we were able to do</i>
<i>through the dashboard of</i>

418
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,952
<i>your car, which, like all</i>
<i>hybrids, is secretly monitored</i>

419
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,068
by the government.

420
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,195
Bravo, Chief.

421
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,161
Or should I say, Clancy?

422
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,160
Yeah, thanks...

423
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,041
Wait a minute--
why so familiar?

424
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:25,619
Because I'm afraid you don't
have jurisdiction in this state.

425
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,495
(in Southern accent):
Welcome to <i>my </i>jurisdiction.

426
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,300
(with Minnesota accent):
You just, uh, go ahead

427
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,170
and put your hands
up there, mister.

428
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:41,425
(with New Jersey accent):
Oh. You got the right
to remain silent over here. Oh.

429
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,098
We're takin' you in.

430
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,475
But first, we're gonna make
a stop at the shore

431
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,522
for some Skee-Ball
and funnel cakes. Oh!

432
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:58,318
Oh, Bart, I am so glad
everything's okay.

433
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,985
Well, not
everything.

434
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:03,543
Apparently someone switched
your face with a butt.

435
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,999
(laughs)

436
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,788
(groans)

437
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,456
Well, whoever moves in,

438
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,714
it can't be worse than having
a murderer next door.

439
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,881
Howdilly-dowdilly,
next-door-oonies.

440
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,387
Howdy, Cousin Ted.

441
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,719
Howdy do to you, Cousin Ned.

442
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,223
How are Roddy and Toddy?

443
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,885
Flantastic times two.
How are Connie and Bonnie?

444
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,144
Dandy as candy,
like every good Flandy.

445
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,097
Glad to hear it,
thank the Holy Spirit.

446
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,317
Glad to say it, and now
the girls will "yay" it.

447
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,688
-GIRLS: Yay.
-Stop! Stop! Stop!

448
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,663
(chattering)

449
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,569
Shh!

450
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,753
