1
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,082
D'oh!

2
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,545
A home and garden show?

3
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,983
Mom, you said
we were going to a videogame expo.

4
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,252
You told me we were gonna
pick up trash by the freeway.

5
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,688
You told me something
but I wasn't listening.

6
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:30,788
I'm sorry for fibbing.

7
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:35,729
Tell you what, if you don't like it,
you can complain all the way home.

8
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,719
Fair enough. Kids, let's practice.

9
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:42,836
Well, that sucks.

10
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,005
There's a day we'll never get back.
- I was so bored!

11
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,139
That was good.

12
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,710
But, Lisa, you're still complaining
from your throat, not your diaphragm.

13
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,143
I was so bored

14
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:02,288
Ooh! Look, a welcome mat
that tells you your weight.

15
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:03,823
AUTOMA TED MALE VOICE: Your weight is...

16
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:05,291
Warranty voided.

17
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:06,393
D'oh!

18
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,873
Oh, my God! Look over there!

19
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,598
The Sprinkle King, Sprinkle Queen
and Deluxe Sprinkle King...

20
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:17,971
...are the Simon and Garfunkel plus one
of hose/nozzle dispersal arrays. Observe.

21
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,071
Hmm. Hmm.

22
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,377
Classic hose play.

23
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,412
What is that soothing sound?

24
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,547
Maybe it's beef stew.

25
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,381
Hot tubs! Guys, what's it like?

26
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:38,393
Getting a backrub from an orgasm.

27
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,261
I want to buy your fanciest hot tub.

28
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,761
You mean the You Soup 5000.

29
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,366
Please, can I get it,
Marge? Please, please?

30
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,034
I can have all my birthday parties in it.

31
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:52,809
I'll be less stressed.
And I'm really freaking stressed!

32
00:02:55,775 --> 00:03:00,280
If I'm more relaxed, I'll be a better mom.
Can we? Can we?

33
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,348
Wait a minute. Who am I pleading with?
- Beats me.

34
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,751
I don't know.
- Please, please, please.

35
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,623
Now I know why lobsters
let out that joyful squeal...

36
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,725
...when they're dropped in the pot.

37
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:13,827
Uh-oh.

38
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,902
We're starting to attract swingers.

39
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:19,799
All right!
- Yeah.

40
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,401
Yes!
- Look at that.

41
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,803
I'm on it.

42
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:26,028
Go back to your day spas!

43
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,444
Maybe we should get out now.

44
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,179
Interesting proposal.

45
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:36,483
Now with an opposing point of view,
bubbles!

46
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,750
LISA: Oh, yeah!

47
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,724
Hey, cool your jets!
We're trying to get to sleep!

48
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:47,026
Hey, Flanders, why don't you join us?

49
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:51,290
Afraid you'll get your mustache wet?
- Well, yes.

50
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,117
Come on, man! Baptize your buns!

51
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,370
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

52
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,353
I feel like we're forgetting something.

53
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:19,619
Mmm. There was a note on the fridge
marked 'urgent.' Funny word, urgent.

54
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,217
Urgent. Urgent.

55
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,464
One of us should go look at it.

56
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:28,295
Mmm. Probably a reminder to relax more.

57
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,097
Oh, yeah.
- That's it.

58
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,717
I'm sorry, Abe. We just can't wait
for your family any longer.

59
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:45,923
But they're coming.

60
00:04:46,023 --> 00:04:48,588
My son even put a note
on his refrigerator.

61
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,424
Please wait.
- I'm afraid it's too late.

62
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,259
On your mark, get set...

63
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,123
No!

64
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,833
They're blanks, Abe.

65
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,747
Hey, what happened to the bubbles?
- You good-for-nothing jellyfish!

66
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,917
While you were lying here
soaking like a bunch of dirty dishes,

67
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:23,967
I was Ionelier than Estes Kefauver
at a meeting of Murder Incorporated!

68
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,787
That actually makes sense! Look it up!

69
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,612
Sorry we missed your special day, Grampa.

70
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,547
We'll definitely go next year.

71
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,117
The thing is,
I ain't got much life left to live,

72
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:55,722
and a wasted day like today
is one I know I'll never get back.

73
00:05:55,822 --> 00:06:00,282
Oh, Dad, I never knew
you had dreams or emotions.

74
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,828
We'll make it up to you.

75
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:06,199
We'll do something you've always
wanted to do but never got the chance.

76
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,302
Well, there are a few things
I was hoping to do...

77
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,304
...before I become dust in a jar.

78
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,606
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who said anything about a jar?

79
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,706
Anyway, I made a list.

80
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,443
Okay.

81
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,780
'Pitch in the Negro Leagues.'

82
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,316
I can think of at least
two problems with that.

83
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,052
Can't read that one. My thumb's over it.

84
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,921
We'll do that one!

85
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,594
HOMER: This place is in Ireland?
ABE: That's right.

86
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,629
Now let's make our reservations!

87
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,724
Lousy old man,
making me look up at an airplane.

88
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,974
PILOTON P. A: Welcome to Ireland,
also known as the Emerald Isle,

89
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,811
Potatoville, East Boston,
Freckle Bog, the Land of Poetry...

90
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,646
...and the Land of Bad Poetry.

91
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,616
And on your left,
you'll see Western Ireland.

92
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,985
On your right, you'll see Kathy Ireland.

93
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,085
Hi, everyone.

94
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,425
I'm finally back.

95
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:13,599
The days I spent at O'Flanagan's Pub
were the happiest ones of my life.

96
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,235
ALL: We drink all day
We're full of guilt

97
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:20,585
We know we're not Scots
'cause we don't wear a kilt

98
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,643
We toss our darts with a beer in our hand

99
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,512
We boil our food
till it tastes really bland

100
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:32,278
This is the life in Ireland

101
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,356
Ireland!

102
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:03,547
Oh, this is the life in Ireland

103
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,820
LISA: Dunkilderry is so quaint.

104
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,158
It looks like the puzzle
at the pediatrician's office.

105
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:16,529
Get ready to step back to a simpler age,
filled with tweed caps,

106
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,774
cheerful sheep and unending troubles.

107
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,271
What the...

108
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,371
Upscale boutiques?

109
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,375
Yup-rechauns!

110
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:31,611
Plasma screen TV.

111
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,280
Summer in Tuscany.

112
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:39,055
Well, Ireland is at the forefront
of Europe's tech boom.

113
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,557
In your face, Belgium!

114
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:48,928
Bart, if you hate Belgium so much,
maybe I should take your Tintins away!

115
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,028
No! I'll be good.

116
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:56,007
But my favorite pub is still there.

117
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,277
This isn't the way I remember it!
Where's the customers?

118
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,547
Where's the singing?
Where's 20-year-old me?

119
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,082
Run! Run, you big sack of glue!

120
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,377
Tom O'Flanagan?
- Quiet!

121
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:17,590
They're in the home stretch now!
Come on. Come on. Move your fetlocks!

122
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,892
Damn it! Will you ever win this race?

123
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:23,325
This broadcast is from 1979.
- Yes.

124
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,829
I'm just an old man yelling at me tapes.

125
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,938
I've got lots of time for that now
no one comes into me bar anymore.

126
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,875
It's been years since
I've sold so much as a pint.

127
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,109
Don't you mean 'pint'?

128
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,345
It's been so long
I've forgotten how to say it!

129
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:43,100
It's a joke to even
call this place a pube.

130
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,051
What happened, Tom?

131
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:48,187
Everyone got jobs, that's what happened.

132
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:53,125
Sir, I brought my father thousands
of miles just to drink at your bar.

133
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:57,029
Do you mean it? Look, don't toy
with an old man's heart now.

134
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:00,274
Give me a beer and a shot of whiskey.

135
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,469
I'll have one drink, one cocktail
and one booze, please.

136
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:04,570
Oh!

137
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,206
While your father
and your grandfather have a drink,

138
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,941
we're going to see sights.

139
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,777
Hey, I just spent 10 hours on a plane.
I'm staying here.

140
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,412
They've got German Krusty on TV.

141
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,792
Such a beautiful language.

142
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,795
That's not how a family vacation works.

143
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:33,633
We do things together
while your father has fun without us.

144
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,801
All right, Tom, pour me a drink.

145
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,404
We have this delicious Australian Shiraz.

146
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,768
An Irish drink.
- Fine.

147
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:49,382
Here's some Bushmills whiskey served
in a potato, floating in a Guinness stout!

148
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,275
I said an Irish drink!

149
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,553
That's better.

150
00:10:57,556 --> 00:11:02,228
'The Giant's Causeway
is the result of a volcanic eruption.'

151
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:06,578
Well, kids,
isn't that an informational fact? Kids?

152
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,136
Come back here!

153
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,704

154
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:28,521
Guinness has been brewed since 1759.
Who'd like to know our secret recipe?

155
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,957
I'm not going to tell you.

156
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,260
Sure if I did, it wouldn't be a secret.

157
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,895
MAN: Oh, yeah.

158
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,331
That concludes our tour.
- WOMAN: She is great.

159
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,374
Well, you may know the ingredients,

160
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,877
but you don't know the ratio!
- Fifty-fifty?

161
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:02,922
'At Mick Ellis Island, returning
immigrants who are sick of America...

162
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,324
'are processed by Irish authorities.'

163
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:06,926
Name?
- Frank Smith.

164
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,495
From now on,
you're Francis O'Shaunessey. Next.

165
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,398
Bill Jones.
- Seamus Fitzpatrick. Next.

166
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:16,918
You're Liam Fitzpatrick
and you're brothers with him.

167
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:21,786
I said you're brothers.
I didn't say you got along.

168
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,546
They say if you kiss the Blarney Stone,

169
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,915
you get the gift of gab, which is great,

170
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:33,319
but I'm not sure I like the idea
of getting a gift in return for kissing.

171
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,655
What kind of a message is that
for Lisa and Maggie?

172
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,623
Those are my daughters.
But on the other hand,

173
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:41,727
America doesn't have any stones
worth kissing, except for Stone Phillips.

174
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:46,332
Do you have one of him here?
If so, he's our your him.

175
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:55,606
K- l-S-S-M-Y-A-S-S spells kiss my ass

176
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,212
BART: Fresh.

177
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,817
I'm gonna carve me initials in it!

178
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:16,217
ALL: This is the life in Ireland

179
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,498
You okay, Dad?

180
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:23,102
I just had a nightmare
that I was back with your mother!

181
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,405
How I miss her.

182
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,283
Ah! There they are,
Dunkilderry's newest tavern keepers.

183
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,920
Well, last night you said
you never wanted to leave this pub,

184
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,889
so you bought it from me.
- We what?

185
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,709
All these pictures tell no lies.

186
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,930
There's you meeting with the loan officer
and the title insurance company.

187
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,034
Here's me replacing the window sashes
that had the termite damage,

188
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,103
as per the escrow agreement.

189
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,805
I have to say, for blind drunks,

190
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:03,342
you had an excellent knowledge
of Irish real estate law.

191
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,501
We bought this dump?

192
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,011
You most certainly did.

193
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:10,449
ABE: What the...

194
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,524
So long, suckers!

195
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,264
Well, Dad, was there anything on your
list about being cheated by an Irishman?

196
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,659
Fourth one from the bottom.

197
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,068
D'oh!

198
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,803
That takes care of my next one.

199
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,180
I never heard of half this stuff.

200
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,018
This brandy is 50 years
old! Better toss it!

201
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:47,049
Hey, boy-o! How about a tall cool one?

202
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,890
How about you, Green Sleeves?
Irishmen love to get drunk!

203
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,726
I'm in AA.
- Who are you? Stuttering Fonzie?

204
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,695
What about you, Bicycle Pants?

205
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,465
I'm late for a teleconference
with Hong Kong, you fat gob!

206
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,565
Why, you...

207
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,801
Uh-oh.

208
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,437
Our first sale!

209
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,806
Our first refund.

210
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:14,446
Find any customers?
- Yeah! Look at them crowding the bar!

211
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:19,418
There's Sully and Mack, Jimmy D.
And Jimmy B. What can I get you, boys?

212
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:22,146
The usual? We are so screwed!

213
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,194
It must be Bloomsday.

214
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,764
Every June 16, lovers of James Joyce
follow the route...

215
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:35,134
...traveled by Leopold Bloom
in the novel Ulysses.

216
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,954
Hmm. Let me make a note of that.

217
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,739
Mmm-hmm.

218
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,976
What you're saying is,
we've run out of fun things to do.

219
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,211
Pretty much, yeah.

220
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,745
There's always something to do in Ireland.

221
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:50,316
I'm trying to woo back a girl
that I met in a music shop.

222
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,416
Watch this, kids.

223
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:55,644
I don't know you

224
00:15:56,188 --> 00:16:01,683
But I want you all the more

225
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,863
Leave me alone! I have a husband!

226
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,343
And quit sending her pianos!

227
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,939
Ireland doesn't like pubs anymore.

228
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:18,377
It's as if Danish people stopped
liking sleek modern design!

229
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,580
Bite your tongue!
That will never ever happen!

230
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,848
Well, we need help,

231
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:29,238
someone who can make money with a bar
that has no customers and zero charm.

232
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:37,263
Moe, you shipped yourself here?
- No. It's how you fly coach on Delta now.

233
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,031
Moe, something terrible has happened.

234
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,500
The Irish have become
hardworking and sober!

235
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,369
Here's how you turn this place around.

236
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:48,040
I let people do things in my bar
they can't do nowhere else.

237
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,910
You want a drink on a Sunday morning?
No problem.

238
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,711
You want to slow dance with a goat?

239
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,848
I'll be doing a lot of things,
but judging ain't one of them.

240
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,384
Are you saying we should break the law?

241
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,645
The law? That jerk?

242
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:05,779
So what can't people do
in modern Ireland?

243
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,631
Well, they're certainly liberal
when it comes to romance.

244
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,037
Sorry, but smoking in pubs
ain't part of the new Ireland.

245
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,538
Also, you can't text while driving.

246
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,008
What has happened to the ways of old?

247
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,978
People can't smoke indoors in Ireland!

248
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,847
Then you let them. Open a smoke-easy.

249
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:32,678
Gentlemen, we have a lot of work to do.

250
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,533
Ooh!

251
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,101
Moe, you were right.
- Thanks.

252
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:54,073
Now I'm gonna go look for my grandfather
based on this childhood photo.

253
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:58,177
All I remember about him is
he was part of a complete breakfast.

254
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:04,316
The day they banned smoking from pubs,
a little bit of Ireland died.

255
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:09,088
But thanks to these two sweet Yanks,
our lungs are black with joy!

256
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:12,928
To Homer and his da!
- ALL: Homer and his da!

257
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:17,621
Well, Da, it looks like all your 'der'
have come 'ter.'

258
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,926
Aw... My son's first stroke.

259
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:32,018
Look at all this euro dough.
These shamrocks sure love their tobaccy.

260
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,847
So it's a smoke-easy you're running, then?

261
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,983
So it's escaping you're thinking of, then?

262
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,352
I can't tell if those are questions
or statements.

263
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,689
So it's our syntax you're
criticizing, then?

264
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,491
Close her down, boys!

265
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,388
Throw them in the paddy wagon!

266
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,508
I mean, the 'us' wagon!

267
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,355
Son, this was all my fault.

268
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:19,892
You were just trying
to make an old man happy.

269
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,161
Don't worry, Dad. We'll get out.

270
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:25,097
America is the New York Yankees
of countries,

271
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,866
powerful and respected
until the year 2000.

272
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:31,834
Oh, son, you know
how I love a good analogy.

273
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:34,137
It was apt.

274
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,342
Let me say, I've always admired the Irish,

275
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:42,202
Knute Rockne, Larry Bird,
and especially Mr. Potato Head.

276
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,415
Go on.

277
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:47,510
But I ask you,
who does smoking actually hurt...

278
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,389
...except the smokers,
those around them...

279
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,425
...and the unborn children
of the pregnant women we let in free...

280
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,295
...on Expectant-Mothers-Drink-Free Night?

281
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,699
So I hope you'll forgive
two well-meaning Americans...

282
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,971
...for trying to take Ireland back
to the good old days of Angela 's Ashes.

283
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,372
Thank you.

284
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,809
That was absolutely terrible.

285
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,211
But fortunately for you,

286
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:16,048
the punishment for your offense
is deportation and a small fine.

287
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,316
Thank you, Your Honor.

288
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:21,286
And may I say,
I'm glad I could see Ireland again,

289
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,455
even if it isn't what I remembered.

290
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:27,960
It got a lot nicer since we sent all
our incompetent half-wits to America...

291
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,463
...where you, for some reason,
made them police officers.

292
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,965
Top of the morning to you.

293
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,535
Chief Clancy Wiggum here to pick up
the Simpsons and take them back to the...

294
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:41,940
Jeez, that smarts!
Better put a little ouchie spray on it.

295
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:48,492
Oh, boy! I better call for some backup.

296
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,283
This is Unit One...

297
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,781
Oh, God.

298
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,549
