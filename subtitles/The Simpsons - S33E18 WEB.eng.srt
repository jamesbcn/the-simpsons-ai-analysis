1
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,126
Second grade
is a turbulent time.

2
00:00:13,226 --> 00:00:15,532
In gym, I was given a "C"

3
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:19,205
when I refused to play
with the non-vegan football.

4
00:00:19,272 --> 00:00:22,011
And so, I was searching
for meaning.

5
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:23,748
And extra credit.

6
00:00:23,814 --> 00:00:28,591
I found it in the Future Nature
Documentarian Day Camp.

7
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,494
I knew two things going in.

8
00:00:30,562 --> 00:00:33,968
I would produce
a three-minute documentary

9
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:37,208
and lunch would not be provided.

10
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:40,380
What I didn't know
was that I would become friends

11
00:00:40,447 --> 00:00:43,286
with an eight-armed miracle.

12
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:49,265
At first, she was shy, like me.

13
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:51,704
Unlike me,
most of her brain cells

14
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,841
are located in her tentacles.

15
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:57,816
Which can smell, taste
and even think.

16
00:00:58,784 --> 00:01:00,521
I named her Molly.

17
00:01:00,588 --> 00:01:03,928
She was the most
fascinating creature.

18
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:06,332
A master of camouflage.

19
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:12,646
Her liquid body could slip
into the tiniest spaces.

20
00:01:12,746 --> 00:01:14,415
A shark!

21
00:01:14,482 --> 00:01:17,421
Mom! I'm recording
my voice-over.

22
00:01:17,488 --> 00:01:19,826
I wasn't expecting
to see a shark.

23
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,129
What if it bit you?

24
00:01:21,195 --> 00:01:23,033
Quick, let me do a finger count.

25
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:26,039
It's a tiny shark.
It's not dangerous to people.

26
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:28,343
I don't like you hanging out
with sharks.

27
00:01:28,443 --> 00:01:30,314
You should have land friends.

28
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,550
Noted.

29
00:01:31,617 --> 00:01:36,225
Though Molly and I
are both solitary creatures,

30
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:39,098
we forged a bond.

31
00:01:39,198 --> 00:01:41,971
- Mom.
- It's so cute.

32
00:01:42,037 --> 00:01:44,408
Your résumé is impressive.

33
00:01:44,475 --> 00:01:45,475
Very impressive.

34
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:48,116
You won the Tishman Prize
for Classroom Excellence

35
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:51,155
and the Fallberg Prize
for Cloakroom Excellence.

36
00:01:51,255 --> 00:01:53,995
I invented a new coat hook.

37
00:01:54,028 --> 00:01:56,466
So, what brings you
to Springfield?

38
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:59,973
Oh, my husband was hired by the
Springfield Symphony Orchestra.

39
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,113
He's an oboist. He's not great.

40
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:05,050
But that-that was unsupportive.

41
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,287
He's good. Oboe is hard.

42
00:02:07,354 --> 00:02:10,528
See, for two years
I taught in Ghana,

43
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:14,168
which was so rewarding,
but not so much for him.

44
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:15,705
Ghana doesn't have an orchestra?

45
00:02:15,838 --> 00:02:18,511
Well, they do, but you have to
be really good to play in it...

46
00:02:18,577 --> 00:02:21,182
Ooh, n-not that Springfield
isn't good.

47
00:02:21,249 --> 00:02:26,192
It is a fine regional orchestra,
and-and my husband

48
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:28,430
fits right in.

49
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:30,635
Anyway, that's why we're here.

50
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:33,941
Uh, uh, would you, uh,
excuse us for one moment?

51
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:36,279
Oh, uh, c-certainly.

52
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:40,755
Yes. An actual
qualified teacher.

53
00:02:40,855 --> 00:02:43,994
And she's stuck here because
her husband sucks at oboe.

54
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:45,163
Booyah!

55
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,506
Obviously, we're meeting
with other applicants...

56
00:02:49,573 --> 00:02:52,444
Of course, and I'm meeting
with other schools.

57
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:53,814
No! You're hired, you're hired.

58
00:02:53,914 --> 00:02:56,954
Here's a ninety, uh, three
dollar signing bonus.

59
00:02:57,054 --> 00:02:58,557
And you can have
his parking spot.

60
00:02:58,624 --> 00:03:01,663
I'll park at the yogurt place.
They-they know me there.

61
00:03:05,705 --> 00:03:07,441
Are-are you okay?

62
00:03:09,245 --> 00:03:11,149
Boys, meet your new teacher,
Ms. Peyton.

63
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:13,253
This is Nelson, Milhouse and...

64
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,625
w-who is that
behind that locker?

65
00:03:15,758 --> 00:03:16,994
Just me. Bart.

66
00:03:17,027 --> 00:03:19,165
Bart. Bart.

67
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,135
You know, like a seal?

68
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,874
You look familiar. Have we met?

69
00:03:23,974 --> 00:03:25,812
No! You are a stranger.

70
00:03:25,912 --> 00:03:30,454
Stranger, stranger,
overheating alert, alert, alert.

71
00:03:30,555 --> 00:03:32,157
Shutting down. Self-destruct.

72
00:03:38,671 --> 00:03:41,476
Bart had Skittles
with milk for breakfast.

73
00:03:41,543 --> 00:03:44,816
I told him he couldn't
handle the rainbow.

74
00:03:51,062 --> 00:03:53,199
I wanted to chase
the shark away,

75
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:57,207
but the documentarian oath
is "never interfere."

76
00:03:57,274 --> 00:03:59,846
It's printed on the T-shirt.

77
00:04:01,082 --> 00:04:04,790
Molly tried to armor herself
against the predator.

78
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:06,459
But it wasn't enough.

79
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,269
As a filmmaker, all I could do
was watch in horror

80
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,406
and rack focus on the shark.

81
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:16,847
I hope I made a difference
in Molly's short life,

82
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:19,218
because she will forever be.

83
00:04:19,318 --> 00:04:23,293
My Cephalopod Soulmate.

84
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:32,010
Oh, Lisa, your movie
was so sad and beautiful.

85
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:34,315
That poor octomapus.

86
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:35,894
Your movie really makes you
think about

87
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:38,289
the wondrous creature
beneath the batter

88
00:04:38,356 --> 00:04:41,262
and the marinara sauce
and the...

89
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:46,139
Mmm, Lisa's friend.

90
00:04:46,205 --> 00:04:48,376
I think I need some time alone.

91
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:51,950
- Of course.
- Oh, sweetie, whatever you need.

92
00:04:56,827 --> 00:04:58,363
I won an award!

93
00:04:58,429 --> 00:05:02,404
Well, actually,
we won an award.

94
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:06,445
You want to watch it again?

95
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:20,140
I know, I broke the code
and interfered.

96
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,848
Maybe I should give back
the trophy.

97
00:05:24,816 --> 00:05:28,389
Or we could do that.
Problem solved.

98
00:05:28,456 --> 00:05:30,595
You're so smart.

99
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:33,433
Be patient.

100
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,105
They may test you at first,
but it's only because

101
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:39,144
of their terribly sad
home lives.

102
00:05:39,245 --> 00:05:42,619
Hello, teachers.
My name is Rayshelle Peyton.

103
00:05:42,685 --> 00:05:44,823
This is my first day,
so you'll have to tell me

104
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,827
all the inside jokes.

105
00:05:46,927 --> 00:05:51,603
I have a ruptured disk,
but I can't afford to stay home.

106
00:05:51,703 --> 00:05:56,112
I can't wait to hear
the story behind that.

107
00:05:56,178 --> 00:05:58,116
Show of hands,

108
00:05:58,182 --> 00:05:59,318
who here is familiar

109
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:01,122
with project-based learning?

110
00:06:04,428 --> 00:06:06,533
The reason I ask:
My last school did a project

111
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,969
where each grade built a model

112
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:09,806
of one of the New Seven Wonders
of the World,

113
00:06:09,873 --> 00:06:12,110
and for the next month,
all subjects...

114
00:06:12,177 --> 00:06:14,348
Math, art, history and science...

115
00:06:14,448 --> 00:06:18,724
Were taught by designing
and building the project.

116
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:23,032
If you're undecided, I've got
a much longer presentation.

117
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,836
Let me grab my puppets.

118
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,508
Look, whatever is making
all this happen,

119
00:06:27,575 --> 00:06:30,447
either adjust
the dosage or share.

120
00:06:30,548 --> 00:06:32,251
Oh, I get it.

121
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:34,421
You don't want
to abandon the lessons

122
00:06:34,488 --> 00:06:36,893
you've already
carefully prepared

123
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,870
to follow these
step-by-step plans.

124
00:06:41,937 --> 00:06:44,441
The lessons
are already written out?

125
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:46,379
This is like the HelloFresh
of teaching.

126
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,184
I can be on cruise control
for a month.

127
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:51,088
I'm second grade.
What are we making?

128
00:06:51,188 --> 00:06:52,859
- Chichen Itza.
- Great.

129
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,564
I'll start by finding out
what that is.

130
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,471
These self-portraits are gonna
help me get to know you better.

131
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:03,514
This way, I get to see you
the way you see you.

132
00:07:04,816 --> 00:07:06,553
Wow.

133
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,557
Classic compulsive overachiever.

134
00:07:08,624 --> 00:07:10,962
Relax, this isn't being graded.

135
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:12,799
I mean, A+.

136
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:17,875
Uh, this is me beating up
Santa until he's my dad.

137
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:20,982
Okay, violent,

138
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:23,419
but he cares about
holidays and family.

139
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:25,123
I can work with this.

140
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,729
That's a lot of glue.

141
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:30,200
How is that part
of your self-portrait?

142
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:32,905
Because, you know...

143
00:07:32,972 --> 00:07:36,813
m-my-my face always has,
u-uh, glue on it.

144
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,118
Oh. Really?

145
00:07:39,218 --> 00:07:40,621
Yeah, see?

146
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:42,491
I am glue-face.

147
00:07:42,558 --> 00:07:45,598
I have slept
for a thousand years.

148
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:50,340
That did not hurt.

149
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:53,514
Take me to
your principal, I... Oh!

150
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:56,152
Glue-face want door.

151
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:58,189
Glue-face need restroom.

152
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:01,062
What the hell
is wrong with this kid?

153
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:08,076
Dude, what are you

154
00:08:08,176 --> 00:08:09,922
- doing in there?
- I know it's not a sidekick's place

155
00:08:09,946 --> 00:08:12,451
to give notes,
but for the past few weeks,

156
00:08:12,518 --> 00:08:14,088
nothing's landing.

157
00:08:14,221 --> 00:08:17,194
Really? I thought milk-nose
glitter sneeze landed.

158
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:19,498
No. It did not land.

159
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,839
- Really hard to look at.
- You don't seem in control.

160
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:26,713
We can't laugh at your clowning
if we're concerned about you.

161
00:08:26,813 --> 00:08:30,253
Why are you messing
with Ms. Peyton? She's nice.

162
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,592
I don't know
why I do stuff, okay?

163
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:35,430
I don't know
why I'm yelling now!

164
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:37,100
I'm not gonna noogie you,

165
00:08:37,134 --> 00:08:40,306
but when you think
about your actions today,

166
00:08:40,373 --> 00:08:43,046
I hope you noogie yourself.

167
00:08:46,285 --> 00:08:48,322
How'd you do that?

168
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:50,126
Wait, no. What are you do...

169
00:08:50,193 --> 00:08:51,763
No. No, no. Don't do that.

170
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,201
No, no, no.

171
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:05,991
There's supposed to be
a Krazy Krusty Ball in here.

172
00:09:08,597 --> 00:09:10,500
That is a crazy ball.

173
00:09:10,568 --> 00:09:12,237
Uh, can I have it?

174
00:09:12,337 --> 00:09:15,243
- Sure. Think fast.
- No, don't.

175
00:09:16,345 --> 00:09:18,751
Oh, you inked.

176
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:23,292
Uh, you might not want
to eat that cereal.

177
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:24,996
Hmm? Why not?

178
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:26,933
Uh, no reason. No.

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,741
I'm just gonna go Google
some toxicology stuff.

180
00:09:30,808 --> 00:09:33,947
Kids love Google.

181
00:09:34,014 --> 00:09:35,718
Huh, using an X-Acto knife

182
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:38,991
to make the Styrofoam look
like stone was a cool idea.

183
00:09:39,057 --> 00:09:42,164
Wait, did I just use "cool"
to describe homework?

184
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,901
What is happening to me?

185
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:56,593
This Friday, there's an assembly
to present the Seven Wonders.

186
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,962
Your parents will be there,

187
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:01,235
and they'll judge me
based on what you do.

188
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:02,972
But no pressure.

189
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:05,276
Well, a little pressure.

190
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,847
Pressure makes diamonds.

191
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:10,120
Anyway, take your projects out
and get to work, please.

192
00:10:10,186 --> 00:10:13,727
Milhouse, I love how
you carved the Styrofoam

193
00:10:13,827 --> 00:10:16,432
to make it look like stones.

194
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:19,071
I used an X-Acto knife.

195
00:10:20,774 --> 00:10:23,146
Bart. What's wrong?

196
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:24,716
I didn't mean to do that.

197
00:10:24,816 --> 00:10:26,686
Great work, Milhouse.

198
00:10:26,753 --> 00:10:28,757
I meant to do this.

199
00:10:29,926 --> 00:10:33,700
- Bart.
- I lost my fingerprints gluing that.

200
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,172
We had to go to urgent care.

201
00:10:36,238 --> 00:10:38,710
I saw a drug addict!

202
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:46,158
Now I've got
an octopus-proof tank

203
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:49,464
with safety latch,
escape alarm, and...

204
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,870
Where did... where did you go?

205
00:11:19,157 --> 00:11:24,067
First of all,
I am enjoying Bart's energy.

206
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:27,040
Uh, uh, you don't have to say
nice stuff about Bart.

207
00:11:27,107 --> 00:11:29,478
- We know the drill.
- Okay, good.

208
00:11:29,546 --> 00:11:31,248
Just tell us
what's wrong with him.

209
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:33,921
To be honest, I'm not sure.

210
00:11:33,987 --> 00:11:36,158
I have tried
every intervention I know.

211
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:39,264
Letting him be the teacher,
scaring him straight,

212
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:42,905
dunce caps, genius pants,
negging, Breakfast Clubbing,

213
00:11:43,005 --> 00:11:46,178
no recess, nothing but recess,
puppy stickers.

214
00:11:46,245 --> 00:11:48,784
Oh. Bart's always
had his problems,

215
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:51,623
but now it sounds like
they're turning into...

216
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:53,794
...issues.

217
00:11:53,894 --> 00:11:57,234
Don't worry, I am going to get
to the bottom

218
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,204
of why he's acting out.

219
00:11:59,271 --> 00:12:02,077
Could each of you fill out this
child development questionnaire?

220
00:12:02,143 --> 00:12:04,716
You need to know how long
I was in labor?

221
00:12:04,782 --> 00:12:07,588
Oh, does that question
bother you?

222
00:12:07,655 --> 00:12:10,594
No. No, not at all. I love it.

223
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:14,569
Hey, Buddy, I think
I know why you've been

224
00:12:14,702 --> 00:12:16,606
such an unlikeable jerk lately.

225
00:12:16,673 --> 00:12:19,144
Someone has a little crush
on their teacher.

226
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:22,417
Someone has a big crush
on being wrong.

227
00:12:22,551 --> 00:12:24,822
Come on, boy, open up to me.
I get it.

228
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:27,127
I was in love
with my school nurse.

229
00:12:27,227 --> 00:12:29,933
I would hurt myself on purpose
just to see her.

230
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:33,439
I'd fall off the monkey bars,
bash my head into a wall,

231
00:12:33,472 --> 00:12:38,316
and sometimes I'd even
fall off the monkey bars.

232
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,055
Actually, there is something
I'm dealing with right now.

233
00:12:41,121 --> 00:12:43,459
- My dad's an idiot.
- Listen, you little...

234
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:47,133
I had brilliant advice
for how to handle a crush.

235
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,173
But now,
I'm keeping it to myself.

236
00:12:50,273 --> 00:12:51,776
I've met her before.

237
00:12:51,843 --> 00:12:53,714
So? I've met people.

238
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,020
Lisa, Maggie. Uh... you!

239
00:12:57,087 --> 00:12:59,892
No, I've met the teacher before.

240
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,863
I'm opening up to you.

241
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:05,103
Oh, okay. Well, go on, son.

242
00:13:05,203 --> 00:13:06,806
When Lisa was doing
her fish movie,

243
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,944
Mom and I would
wait on the beach.

244
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:12,350
Some rich kid left a sand pail
from the fancy hotel.

245
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:19,064
That bucket was my ticket
to the guests-only pool area.

246
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:21,368
At first, it was pretty sweet.

247
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:25,009
Then I tried a fancy dive
off the Tarzan swing.

248
00:13:25,109 --> 00:13:27,080
A belly flop will knock
the wind out of you.

249
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:29,719
Especially a belly
full of hot fudge.

250
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:32,257
I panicked, and suddenly,

251
00:13:32,357 --> 00:13:35,531
I couldn't tread water,
no matter how hard I flailed.

252
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:37,802
And no one was noticing.

253
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,175
But then...

254
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,863
Oh, God.

255
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,934
Are-are you okay?

256
00:13:57,508 --> 00:13:59,411
What happened?

257
00:13:59,512 --> 00:14:00,781
He can't swim.

258
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,083
That poor boy.

259
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:05,624
Why did you do that? I was fine.

260
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:07,293
I'm an amazing swimmer.

261
00:14:07,394 --> 00:14:10,567
I-I'm, I'm sorry,
I-I thought that...

262
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:12,070
I feel awful.

263
00:14:12,137 --> 00:14:14,709
She ruined her dress
and I yelled at her.

264
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:17,748
And my hand went in her mouth
for a second.

265
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,053
She doesn't recognize me, yet.

266
00:14:20,086 --> 00:14:23,426
But when she does,
she's gonna hate me.

267
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:25,998
Every day I tell myself
to be invisible.

268
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,469
Next thing I know,
I'm standing on my desk,

269
00:14:28,537 --> 00:14:31,175
pretending to poop out
the class hamster.

270
00:14:32,343 --> 00:14:36,085
What if you told her the...
whatchamacallit?

271
00:14:36,218 --> 00:14:38,289
- The truth?
- Yeah, that thing.

272
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:40,894
You're right.
If it were out in the open,

273
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:43,099
she'd have nothing on me.

274
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,637
Wow, you actually helped.

275
00:14:45,704 --> 00:14:47,073
I did. You know what?

276
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,779
I think I'm finally ready
to be a dad.

277
00:14:49,846 --> 00:14:51,983
I'm gonna tell my wife!

278
00:14:56,492 --> 00:14:59,364
That's it. Ugh, you are not
safe in this house.

279
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:02,437
Whew, you're coming
to school with me.

280
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:07,848
Oh, this is great.

281
00:15:07,915 --> 00:15:09,852
I'll come clean,
no more weirdness.

282
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:12,223
I feel better already.

283
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,727
Hello.

284
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:18,269
Hmm, isn't that interesting?

285
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:20,173
She's married.

286
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:32,063
Okay, I might be a teensy bit
in love with her.

287
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:51,536
Dad, you were right.

288
00:15:51,603 --> 00:15:52,838
I do have a crush on her.

289
00:15:52,905 --> 00:15:54,341
I saw Ms. Peyton
kiss her husband

290
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:57,247
and I Hulked out
on the water fountain.

291
00:15:57,347 --> 00:15:59,752
Yeah, jealousy will
make you do crazy things.

292
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:03,960
Once, a guy opened the door
for Marge, so I keyed his car.

293
00:16:04,094 --> 00:16:05,463
Which was the school bus.

294
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,568
Turned out he opened
the door for everybody.

295
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:09,037
Except for me, after that.

296
00:16:09,104 --> 00:16:11,308
Well, jealousy is gonna
make me ruin this assembly.

297
00:16:11,341 --> 00:16:13,379
- I can't stop myself.
- Ooh.

298
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:16,251
You said you had great advice
on crushes. What is it?

299
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,857
Here's what you need to know.

300
00:16:18,924 --> 00:16:20,894
You're a kid, she's a grown-up.
Get over it.

301
00:16:20,994 --> 00:16:23,432
That's your amazing advice?

302
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:26,405
That's not advice,
that's just...

303
00:16:26,471 --> 00:16:27,675
...the truth.

304
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:30,581
Look, sometimes there are
awesome things in this world

305
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:33,653
that aren't meant
to be your awesome thing.

306
00:16:33,753 --> 00:16:35,056
You got to let it go.

307
00:16:35,122 --> 00:16:37,895
Trust me,
there's other fish in the sea.

308
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:40,734
He's right. And you
should also be in the sea.

309
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:43,105
Hunting and killing those fish.

310
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:47,013
After school...

311
00:16:47,146 --> 00:16:50,286
...I'll take you
back to your home.

312
00:16:50,353 --> 00:16:53,860
Dad, what if I snap and totally
mess up the assembly?

313
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:55,731
Vent on inanimate objects.

314
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:57,500
Punch a pillow, tear up Kleenex.

315
00:16:57,568 --> 00:17:00,874
I like to scream
into Pringles canisters.

316
00:17:00,941 --> 00:17:02,711
You can do this.

317
00:17:02,811 --> 00:17:05,483
Boom. Parenting is easy.

318
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:09,792
- Mwah.
- Oh.

319
00:17:11,596 --> 00:17:14,067
Okay, Homer said
to punch something soft.

320
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,004
There's nothing soft here.

321
00:17:16,104 --> 00:17:19,579
We are so excited to share
our school-wide project:

322
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:23,419
The New Seven Wonders
Of the World.

323
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:27,962
I want to thank
my wonderful husband Darryl,

324
00:17:28,028 --> 00:17:30,667
who insisted
on providing the music.

325
00:17:35,443 --> 00:17:39,785
Yeah, I get to hear that
all the time.

326
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,123
Oh, man, he's in a band?

327
00:17:42,223 --> 00:17:45,096
Oh, I can't compete with that.

328
00:17:45,162 --> 00:17:47,433
I need something to scream in.

329
00:18:00,827 --> 00:18:02,965
Simpson!

330
00:18:11,315 --> 00:18:14,522
Good lord.
The Redeemer's on a rampage!

331
00:18:15,524 --> 00:18:18,362
Styrofoam specks.

332
00:18:18,462 --> 00:18:20,600
Brushing just attracts
more of them.

333
00:18:22,538 --> 00:18:24,742
Oh... Molly!

334
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:28,917
My lids.

335
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:39,104
Ms. Peyton, please don't
give up on this school

336
00:18:39,204 --> 00:18:41,609
because of one apex disrupter.

337
00:18:41,676 --> 00:18:43,647
Look, you can,
you can switch classes.

338
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,349
Ms. Hoover will teach Bart.

339
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,286
No way. I had him two years ago.

340
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:49,792
My hair fell out in clumps.

341
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:51,495
- I'm not taking him.
- No way.

342
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:53,633
I'd rather go back to prison.

343
00:19:00,146 --> 00:19:02,216
Ms. Peyton?

344
00:19:02,283 --> 00:19:04,722
I'm sorry I ruined everything.

345
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:06,325
You probably won't believe this,

346
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:10,901
but I had an octopus
stuck to my face.

347
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:13,606
- I believe you.
- You do?

348
00:19:13,707 --> 00:19:16,144
Yes, because I know,

349
00:19:16,244 --> 00:19:20,119
deep down, you want to be good.

350
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:22,591
Also, your face is covered
in tentacle hickeys.

351
00:19:22,691 --> 00:19:26,298
There's something
I need to tell you.

352
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:30,507
Really? You didn't get
your fill of destruction today?

353
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,680
You're angry drowning boy.

354
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,619
Oh, I-I'm so sorry. That's what
I call you in my head.

355
00:19:36,686 --> 00:19:39,090
I hope I didn't
embarrass you that day.

356
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,794
I thought you needed help.

357
00:19:40,894 --> 00:19:43,132
I did, actually.

358
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:45,403
I had two sundaes
and some curly fries.

359
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:47,440
It made me forget how to swim.

360
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:50,179
Anyway, thank you for seeing me.

361
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,448
You're welcome.

362
00:19:51,582 --> 00:19:53,586
That's why I've been weird
around you.

363
00:19:53,653 --> 00:19:56,091
Also...

364
00:19:56,191 --> 00:19:57,694
I kind of like you.

365
00:19:57,761 --> 00:19:59,899
I did homework,
and I didn't mind it.

366
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,636
Barf emoji.

367
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:05,142
You know, a crush
on a teacher just means

368
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:07,548
you're coming to love
a new part of yourself

369
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:09,552
that I'm bringing out in you.

370
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:14,494
So I actually have
a crush on myself?

371
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:18,469
And now that you told me,
that'll be less weird, too.

372
00:20:18,536 --> 00:20:22,310
So, do you need help packing up?

373
00:20:22,376 --> 00:20:23,980
I'm staying.

374
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:26,552
A teacher teaches the good kids
and the nightmares.

375
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:30,927
Not that you're a nightmare,
but I-I... Y-You know.

376
00:20:30,994 --> 00:20:32,430
I know. My last teacher

377
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,017
had a little trick
that seemed to work.

378
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,871
Oh, really?

00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:42,226
