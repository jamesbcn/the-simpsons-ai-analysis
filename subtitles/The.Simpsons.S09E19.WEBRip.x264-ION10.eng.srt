-Um, maybe.

{\an8}It's time for our coffee break.

00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,751
{\an8}Hmm? Yeah. I earned it.

20
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:32,007
Mm, doughnuts. (slobbering)

21
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,013
{\an8}Wow, there's only one doughnut left.

{\an8}Yeah, ya drooled all over it, ya-

23
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,351
{\an8}Gentlemen, there's only one solution.

24
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,813
{\an8}We place this last doughnut
in the reactor core

25
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,772
{\an8}exposing it to radiation,
thereby making it big!

26
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,363
{\an8}Yeah, it worked on my hand!

27
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,067
{\an8}Oh, wait. It's this hand. Whoa!

00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,645
{\an8}(humming, throbbing)

29
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,830
{\an8}Uh, sir, we found the problem.
Some idiot threw this in the reactor core.

30
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,923
{\an8}-Success!
-<i>You </i>did this?

32
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,000

maybe it is your first day.

33
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,008
{\an8}-Very well. Carry on.
-Uh, sir, that's Homer Simpson.

34
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,971
{\an8}And he's been working here for 10 years.

35
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:18,851
{\an8}Oh, really! Why did you
think you could lie to me?

36
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,430
{\an8}-It's my first day.

00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:45,427
Homey, I really don't think
this navy thing is a good idea.

65
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,598
-What if you get called into combat?
-Not to worry, honey.

We live in a highly technological age
where fighting a war

67
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,822
is as simple as turning off a light.

-Where are you goin'?
-I've joined the Naval Reserve.

I'm joining too!

79
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,479
And although my religion
strictly forbids military service--

80
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,811
What the hey! I'm in too!

81
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:38,857
Gee, thanks, guys.
This is just like <i>The Deer Hunter.</i>

I'm sorry, guys.
We're shutting down for a while. Sorry.

86
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,762
{\an8}-See you in a week!
-Good luck, Dad.

87
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,169
{\an8}Although I'm morally opposed
to the military-industrial complex

88
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,220
{\an8}of which you are now a part.

89
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,052
{\an8}Aw, that's sweet, honey.
I'll bring you back a hat.

90
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,179
{\an8}Hey, Homer. Bring me back a torpedo.

91
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,097
{\an8}-No!
-But Flanders got his kids torpedoes!

92
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,396
Oh, he did, did he? I'll show him!

93
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,938
I'll bring you a weapon
of unimaginable destructive power!

94
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,935
-Homer!
-But only if you're good.

95
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,026
Even if you're not.

96
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,281

97
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,367

98
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,909
All right, you thumb-sucking worms...

99
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,130
let's get one thing straight,
your mamas ain't here to help you.

100
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,961
-Mine is!
-(belches)

101
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,666
(razors buzzing)

102
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,916
No way, man. My hair is who I am!

103
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,894
Ow, I'm a freak!

104
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,688
-What the--
-(suggestive moaning)

105
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,784
Tuck in that shirt.
Shine those shoes, mister.

106
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,821
-Oh, for the love of--
-Uh, a seagull took my sailor hat.

107
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:12,254
All right, Simpson.
I don't like you, and you don't like me.

108
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,622
-I like you.
-Um, all right.

109
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,829
You like me, but I don't like you.

110
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,799
{\an8}Maybe you would like me
if you got to know me.

111
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,998
{\an8}What are you, a comedian?

112
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,009
(chuckles) Well, I'm no Margaret Cho

113
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,551
but I do a pretty fair Columbo impression.

114
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,545
(imitating Peter Falk as
Columbo) Uh, one more thi--

115
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,557
(coughs) one-- (clears throat)

116
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,139
(as himself) I should get
a glass of water.

117
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,394
(growls)

118
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,320
There. The perfect sheepshank.

119
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,782
Very nice, Simpson. But next time,
tie the other end to the ship!

Ah, that's not a war story!
I'll tell ya a war story!

That's not funny. That hurts!

-You know, Marge?

165
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,940
Joining the Reserves
was the best thing I ever did.

166
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,773
I feel good about myself,
I'm helping my country...

167
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,027
and later, I'm gonna get
Gilligan's autograph.

168
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,861
I'm so proud of you, Homie.

169
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,157
Then I'll whomp him
with my hat! (laughing)

170
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,802
-Can I help you?
-I'd like to get my ear pierced.

171
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,678
Well, better make it quick, kiddo.

172
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,773
In five minutes, this place is
becoming a Starbucks.

173
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,727
{\an8}Hello, everybody! Sparkle, sparkle.

174
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,189
{\an8}-Bart!
-An earring. How rebellious.

175
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,450
{\an8}In a conformist sort of way.

176
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,660
What on earth possessed you
to get an earring?

177
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,791
-Milhouse has one.
-If Milhouse jumped off a cliff--

178
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,789
Milhouse jumped off a cliff? I'm there.

179
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,791
Get back here, boy.
You're a disgrace to this family

180
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,844
-and its proud Naval tradition.
-Well, I'm keeping this earring

181
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,838
and you can't stop me!

182
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,844
{\an8}Oh. I always thought Lisa would be
the one to get her ears pierced.

183
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,474
{\an8}-Can I?
-No!

184
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:39,176
Time to reap the benefits of being cool.

185
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,523
-(gasps)
-(chattering)

186
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,389
I don't believe this.
<i>Everyone's </i>got an earring.

187
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,611
My neck hurts, and my ear hurts.

188
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,861
I have two owies.

189
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,823
Next weekend, we're having
our annual war games.

190
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,324
Now, Simpson, because of
your many years as a nuclear technician...

191
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:01,827
-we're putting you on a nuclear sub.
-"Nuc-u-lar"!

192
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,331
It's pronounced, "nuc-u-lar."

193
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,253
-Oh, whatever.
-"Nuc-u-lar."

194
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:12,172
(chattering)

195
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:16,184
-Be careful, Dad.
-Oh, Lisa. It's just war games.

196
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,548
It's not like a game could hurt me.

197
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,724
Damn you, "Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots."

198
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,767
Can't we all just get along?

199
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,772
Are you sure you'll be OK?

200
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,734
We have orders not to fire
on anybody but Greenpeace.

201
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,574
(smooching sound)
Well, I guess that's everyone.

202
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,282
{\an8}-Except Earring Boy.
-Come on, Dad.

203
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,703
{\an8}Didn't you ever do anything wild
when you were a kid?

204
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,200
Well, when I was 10, I got my ear pierced.

205
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,202
But this is completely different!

206
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,664
Fine. Take it.

207
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,461
Attention on deck!
Captain Tennille wishes to address you.

208
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,715
(clears throat)

209
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,884
I'm a man of few words.

210
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,432
Any questions?

211
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,271
Uh, is the poop deck
really what I think it is?

212
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,481
(laughing) I like the cut of your jib.

213
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:13,402
-What's a jib?
-(laughs) Promote that man.

214
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,491
The navy has a fine sense of tradition.

215
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,073
Whenever an American vessel leaves port...

216
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,538
the crew sings this ancient sea chanty--

217
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,121
A'one, a'two, a'three-

218
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,420
-<i>A 'four--</i>
-('70s Pop Tune plays)

219
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839

220
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:57,192
(vocals end)

221
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,528
(instrumental music playing)

222
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,534

224
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,209
(singing continues)

225
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,634
{\an8}Ya hear that? The whales are hungry.

226
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:19,471
-(imitating whale)
-Homer, join us.

227
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,048
(imitating whale) Thank you.

228
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,846
Tell me, young man.
What do you want out of life?

229
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,890
-I want peas.
-(chuckles) We all want peace!

230
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,886
But it's always just out of reach.

231
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:35,478
-Oh! Uh-huh.
-So, what's the best way to get peace?

232
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,784
-With a knife!
-Exactly!

233
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,860
Not with the olive branch,
but the bayonet.

234
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,905
(chuckling) Oh, Simpson!
You're like the son I never had.

235
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,742
{\an8}And you're like the father I never visit.

236
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,748
Sir! I was running a diagnostic

237
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,910
and there was an obstruction
in torpedo tube number one.

238
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,919
I'll take care of it. (sipping)

239
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,381
(groans) What the hell. Simpson!

240
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,670
-While I'm gone, you're in command.
-Me?

241
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,134
{\an8}-Him?
-Yes.

242
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,417
Maybe it's the salt water in my veins...

243
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,178
{\an8}or the nitrogen bubbles in my brain...

244
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,391
{\an8}but I've taken a real shine to you.

245
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,349
Seaman, open that torpedo tube.

246
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:18,106
You'll never get a response
talking to my son like that.

247
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,942
-You gotta poke 'im with a stick.
-(moaning)

248
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,198
I don't want to go
to school today! (snores)

249
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,200
Oh, for God's sake!

250
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,285
Contraband!

251
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,116
Whoo, comfy.

252
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,538
{\an8}Homer, we got an enemy sub,
closing in fast.

253
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,497
{\an8}-What do we do?
-I don't know.

254
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,433
Fifteen seconds to collision.
We need a decision.

255
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,930
Hmm. What would
the captain say in my spot?

256
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:53,269
-Don't fire the torpedoes!
-Fire the torpedoes!

257
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,480
(Captain groaning)

258
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,935
-We've been hit by an officer!
-If they're gonna fire on us...

259
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,986
we'll respond in kind!

260
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,860
Fire! Not me, a torpedo!

261
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,905
-(rapid beeping)
-We're losing power!

262
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,254
-(engines slowing)
-We're losing backup power!

263
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,500
We're down to mood lighter here.

264
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,092
(instrumental, Bossa Nova)

265
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,093
-(engines come back on)
-(music stops)

266
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,045
All right, all right.
Mellow out, everybody.

267
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,720
The captain will know what to do.

268
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:33,023
You just shot the captain
out of the torpedo tube.

269
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,808
-HOMER:D'oh!
-That means you're in charge, Homer.

270
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,614
-I am?
-(sighs) Those were the orders.

271
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,105
Very well, then. I'm a captain.

272
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,365
Mr. Moe, steady as she goes.

273
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,200
Aye, aye, ya big dummy.

274
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,290
(sighs) What a dummy.

275
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,551
Damage report, Mr. Moe.

276
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,843
{\an8}Sonar, out. Navigation, out.

277
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,299
{\an8}-Radio, out.
-Enough of what's out. What's in?

278
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,808
Ice-blended mocha drinks
and David Schwimmer.

279
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,310
Yes, he is handsome
in an ugly sort of way.

280
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,364
Captain, how are we supposed
to get home with no equipment?

281
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,568
Don't worry. I've been working on it.

282
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,531
Mm, yes! Uh-huh.

283
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,862
Carry the two--

284
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,030
All right. I can't waste any more time.

285
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,078
People's lives are depending on me.

286
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,082
-Mr. Sulu, make a left!
-Aye, aye, Captain.

287
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,673
Setting course for Rigel Seven.
I mean home. (chuckles)

288
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,920
HOMER: <i>That's it. Left. Left.</i>

289
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,804
<i>Steady as she goes--</i>
<i>On second thought, go right.</i>

Oh, my God!

294
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,952
{\an8}I told him that photo
would come back to haunt him.

295
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,544
<i>Could Homer Simpson be a Communist?</i>

296
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,538
<i>His father spoke out on his behalf.</i>

<i>My Homer is not a Communist.</i>

{\an8}The Soviet Union?
I thought you guys broke up.

{\an8}(laughing) Yes! That's
what we wanted you to think!

PRINCIPAL SKINNER:
Children, I'll be frank.

309
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:19,847
In the event of nuclear war,
we can only save our best and brightest.

310
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,643
Therefore, space in the fallout
shelter will be Reserved for...

311
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:26,436
Lisa Simpson, Martin Prince,
our championship kickball team...

312
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,942
and Sherri, but not Terri.

313
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,111
Ha-ha!

314
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:38,079
Captain, the renegade sub
is directly below us.

315
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,998
Drop the depth charges. We'll either
destroy it, or force it to surface.

316
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh, my God! We're all gonna die!

317
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,004
-(intercom sounding)
-Y'ello?

318
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,046
Mayday! Mayday! The engine room
has sprung a leak.

319
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,262
It's filling up with
a clear, nonalcoholic liquid.

320
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,554
-You mean, water?
-Yeah, that's it.

321
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,098
We got a pinhole leak
and there's no way to plug it.

322
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,392
I guess that's it. Ladies and gentlemen...

323
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,984
we're in a tough spot,
and I don't know if we're gonna get out.

324
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,560
Please remain calm,
and think of your loved ones.

325
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,528
(baby talking) Oh, Mr. Snookums.

326
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:15,698
Oh, I "wuv" you so-
What are you looking at?

327
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,200
Hey, this stupid machine took my money!

328
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:26,371
(kissing sound) Don't ever change.

329
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,497
{\an8}-Sparkle, sparkle.
-Bart!

330
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:35,296
{\an8}-Pinole leak!
-Dad? The earring could plug the hole.

331
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,054
{\an8}I'll plug your hole!

332
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,389
I mean, eureka!

333
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,583
{\an8}(cheering)

334
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,794
{\an8}-You saved us, Homer.
-Mr. Moe? Prepare to surface.

335
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,587
{\an8}-You wanna stop calling me Mr. Moe?
-No.

336
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:30,272
Attention, Homer Simpson. You have
10 seconds to explain your actions...

337
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:34,855
-before we open fire!
-Uh, it's my first day!

338
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:39,533
{\an8}-(all laughing)
-(speaking Spanish)

339
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,945
-(laughing)
-(speaking Chinese)

340
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,496
{\an8}-(laughing)
-Quack, quack, quack.

341
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,830
(chittering)

342
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,957
Seaman Simpson, your actions
have given the Navy

343
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,006
a black eye from which
it may never recover.

344
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:02,261
I would throw the book at you, but I've
been indicted in the Tailhook scandal.

345
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,474
-Good-bye.
-I, too, would punish you

346
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:09,305
but I'm under indictment for accepting
bribes from military contractors.

347
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,560
Um, I torpedoed a Carnival Cruise ship.

348
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,567
Impersonating the first lady.

349
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:21,363
-I think you're off the hook.
-Whoo-hoo!

350
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:29,119
A dishonorable discharge.
That's the best we could have hoped for.

351
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:32,714
You can't spell "dishonorable"
without "honorable."

352
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,843
{\an8}I think you're a hero, Dad.

353
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,170
{\an8}Well, I couldn't have
done it without Bart.

354
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:41,126
Boy, I guess I was wrong about
that earring. It saved us all.

355
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,716
Then can I get a tattoo that
says, "Bite me"?

356
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,724
You never know when
it might come in handy.

357
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,854
-I don't think so, son.
-A king cobra?

358
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,351
-HOMER: No.
-BART: Weapons-grade plutonium?

359
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,063
-HOMER: Ask your mother.
-BART: Knockout drops?

360
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,483
-HOMER: No.
-BART: Ninja death stars?

361
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,521
HOMER: Maybe for Christmas.

362
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,057
(theme music played by a marching band)

363
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,151
-(murmuring)
-Shh!

364
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,112
