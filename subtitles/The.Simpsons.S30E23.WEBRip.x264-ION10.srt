1
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,543
D'oh!

2
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:17,285
D'oh!

3
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,495
Sir, I've prepared
your year-end finance report.

4
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,498
Initiate ocular scan mode.

5
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,900
Illuminate...

6
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,002
and recalibrate.

7
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,505
Unthinkable! The horror!

8
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,872
This is the first year
my earnings

9
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:40,040
are lower than the year before.

10
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:41,509
I'm sorry, sir.

11
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,344
These days,
enlightened people like solar,

12
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,413
and the consciously evil
prefer fracking.

13
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:47,248
Why, if this continues,

14
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,883
in 150 years
I'll be out on the street.

15
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:52,086
Sir, sir, sir,
I'm sure there's some sort

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,854
of inessential line item

17
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,423
that no one will miss.

18
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:57,024
Effective immediately...

19
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,260
children's health care will
be cut from workers' benefits.

20
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:10,904
This meeting is over. God bless
the United States of America

21
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,706
and release the hounds.

22
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,378
Oh, I got three kids,
and they've all got health.

23
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,079
I am so cursed.

24
00:01:19,113 --> 00:01:21,415
That's what you get
for having a family.

25
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:23,751
I'm gonna die like I lived.

26
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,853
Nice and lonely.

27
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:29,923
Sweet.

28
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,329
Maybe we can get the kids
government health care.

29
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:38,566
Oh, sorry, Marge,
that's gone, remember?

30
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,669
Because of those corporate
tax cuts we all wanted?

31
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,304
I didn't want them.

32
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:46,274
You say so now,
but I remember you back then.

33
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:48,776
Ooh, corporate tax cuts.

34
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:51,179
Makers not takers.

35
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:54,014
Oh, every time
Ann Coulter has a cold,

36
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,016
you think she's me.

37
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,519
I'm sorry, honey.
We'll just have to cut back

38
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,020
on the kids' meds.

39
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,856
Back in my day,
children didn't need no meds!

40
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,592
You just gave 'em
a slug of whiskey

41
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,926
and sent 'em off to school.

42
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,695
And if they lost their snowshoe,

43
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,697
you'd beat 'em
with the other one!

44
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,534
That's how we raised the
generation that lost Vietnam.

45
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:16,470
Bart, your old attention
deficit disorder medicine

46
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:18,872
isn't covered
by insurance anymore,

47
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:22,142
so we'll have to use a cheaper
drug that's just as good.

48
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:24,011
So goodbye, Focusyn.

49
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:26,580
Hello, Chillaxodol.

50
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:33,221
Mom, I was just
on hypochondria.edu,

51
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:35,356
and I think
you should see something.

52
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,059
Are you giving
your precious child

53
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:43,497
the generic ADD medication
Chillaxodol?

54
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:44,832
Yes. Why?

55
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:47,535
Your child may experience
unwanted side effects,

56
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:50,471
including headaches...

57
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,640
painful spasms...

58
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,543
dry mouth...

59
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:59,513
and whiskers...

60
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:01,815
musical flatulence...

61
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,153
involuntary Memphis
juking...

62
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,858
sudden relocation...

63
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,496
and a symptom
that can only be described

64
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,398
as dolphining.

65
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,371
If you or a loved one

66
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:25,606
is experiencing
any of these side effects,

67
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,575
you would do well to remember

68
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,877
that life is
heartless and brutal,

69
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,746
and the cosmos
is indifferent to us all.

70
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,049
I'd say goodbye,
but what's the point?

71
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:43,123
Without insurance,
we'll just have to go to...

72
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,726
Dr. Nick.

73
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,127
Sorry, everybody.

74
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,798
Remember, if at any time
you become a dog,

75
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,233
then I can medicine you.

76
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,469
No hope.
There's no hope here.

77
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:01,041
The healing magic
of crystals.

78
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,678
Well,
I've tried everything else.

79
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,918
Shalom, kind queen.

80
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:13,554
I mean the hello shalom,
but also the peace one.

81
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,923
How can I soothe you?

82
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,158
That was a lot just now.

83
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:22,496
But yet it's only a snippet
of the cosmic conversation.

84
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,732
Look, my son is having
bad side effects

85
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,400
from his ADD meds.

86
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,469
His father wants him
to join football

87
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,638
for a nice, calming concussion.

88
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,640
I have just the thing for you.

89
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,141
Crystals?

90
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,477
Healing crystals.

91
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,512
I am pretty desperate.

92
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:40,581
Crystals are a timeless database

93
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,451
of energy,
knowledge and sparkling.

94
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:45,486
Scientists are finally waking up

95
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,255
to what pyramids
have known all along.

96
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,692
I vant to suck your money.

97
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:55,696
Maybe I could just buy
a couple rocks and go.

98
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,498
Oh, they're more than rocks.

99
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:00,033
They make
great stocking stuffers.

100
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:01,369
And for Hanukkah?

101
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:02,670
Useless.

102
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,238
Hey.

103
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,880
Bart, it's time
for your ADD treatment.

104
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:18,318
Maybe he's
a little overtrained.

105
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:19,887
It's not a pill.

106
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,288
Ooh, a suppository.

107
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,656
Fill 'er up.

108
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,725
It's not a drug.

109
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,927
I want you to try these.

110
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:37,170
I believe.

111
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,076
A paper by Lisa.
A paper by Lisa.

112
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,479
A paper by Bart.

113
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:48,482
An A?
Oh, my gosh, Bart!

114
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,584
Could it really be the crystals?

115
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:52,820
Yes, definitely the crystals.

116
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,922
You really got an A?

117
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,657
No white-out.

118
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,659
The answers
are actually correct.

119
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,761
Maybe he really did the work.

120
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:04,331
Or maybe he cheated,
and I have to find out how.

121
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,200
Someone could use
a chill-out crystal.

122
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,703
It's made by your boyfriend,
Lis, the Earth!

123
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:11,705
Lisa has a boyfriend?

124
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:13,707
And this is how I find out?

125
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:16,376
I don't know
which of you two is dumber.

126
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,614
So I'm a bit
of a mystery, huh?

127
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,017
Marge,
I heard Bart got an A.

128
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,720
- How'd you do it?
- Can you keep a secret?

129
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:29,122
Unless it's about a person, yes.

130
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,624
It was crystals.

131
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:31,892
Crystals, huh?

132
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,694
I could use
some of those for Kirk.

133
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,463
I want to seed the bed
with them,

134
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,297
so he doesn't crawl over to me.

135
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,933
No worries. I'll
pick up more on my way home.

136
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,304
Oh, no, what happened?

137
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,707
I'm closing the store.
A cot finally opened up

138
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,643
in this cult
I've been trying to get into.

139
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:51,378
Congratulations, I guess.

140
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,146
Can I still buy crystals?

141
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,582
Just take 'em.

142
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:57,985
In fact, you can have
my entire inventory.

143
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,419
Thank you.

144
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:03,691
Now, enter my chariot to Heaven.

145
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,761
Are you sure about this?

146
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:11,398
Of course! I'm ascending
to a higher level of being.

147
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,000
Now, sisters,

148
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,837
let us Sharpie in
the whites of our eyes.

149
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:27,180
Before passing on
to a new owner,

150
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:29,617
crystals should be cleared
of their old energy

151
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,920
with a combination
of water and sulfur.

152
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,723
Which is just
what comes out of our tap!

153
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:43,531
The crystals got Kirk a new job.

154
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:44,932
With a uniform!

155
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,267
That's right, I'm a batboy.

156
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,704
Nelson got an A on his test!

157
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:54,107
This is going right up on the
refrigerator in the front yard.

158
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,644
Marge, we need more crystals.

159
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,049
I'm not even 100% sure
these things work.

160
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,151
Should I really
be selling them?

161
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:07,621
You know, these just
might make me stop drinking.

162
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:10,390
I guess I should.

163
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,593
I'm gonna grind 'em up
and snort 'em.

164
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,570
Marge, another A
in my class for Bart.

165
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:25,739
I'm so impressed that a boy
with Bart's jiggly-wigglies

166
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:28,141
could be cured
by this pagan hogwash.

167
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,410
You can't argue with facts.

168
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,746
Oh, dear, we're
running low on obsidian.

169
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,815
Almost out of moon potion.

170
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,017
And there's
no more brain powder.

171
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,920
I can sell you
brain powder in bulk.

172
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,489
Here's whose brain
the powder is from.

173
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,225
It's a cow,
but a very smart one.

174
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,194
What else do you sell?

175
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,262
Oh, massage stones,
copper bracelets,

176
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:50,598
dream catchers,

177
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,666
dream catcher
filter replacements.

178
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,702
This old one is full of dreams.

179
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,670
I don't see anything in it.

180
00:08:56,704 --> 00:09:00,340
Don't you see it? Your dream
of being a massive success?

181
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,842
You see it?
Right there. See it?

182
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,510
Right there. See it?

183
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,046
I think I am starting to see it.

184
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,781
Are you sure?
Do you really?

185
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:09,049
I see it!

186
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,450
Yeah, okay, bring it down.

187
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,219
Less Oprah, more Chopra.

188
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:15,522
I see it. I guess
I could expand my product line.

189
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,625
Then I can really
start making my own money,

190
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:20,027
not be dependent on Homer.

191
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,962
Did I hear
not dependent on Homer?

192
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:24,965
Boom. Retired.

193
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,800
You should still go in to work.

194
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:29,302
I don't think I even remember
how to get there.

195
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,138
You were just there today.

196
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,140
Feels like that, doesn't it?

197
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:37,978
Here at MURMUR,
we have everything

198
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,980
a holistic mother might need.

199
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,148
Cactus milk.

200
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,816
Wicker birthing chairs.

201
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,251
Fairy traps.

202
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:45,986
Tibetan singing bowls.

203
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:57,497
Are these macaroons free-range?

204
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,334
Yes. Only made from coconuts
that fall from the tree

205
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:04,437
or are gently coaxed
by woke monkeys.

206
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,506
I'm sorry, Marge,

207
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,175
I'm gonna have to shut you down.

208
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,410
You don't have
a retail business license.

209
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,513
Well, Chief,
do I really need a license

210
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:17,184
to sell that hemp body lotion
Sarah likes so much?

211
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:20,120
And which is free to you?

212
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,521
Ooh, I like it too!

213
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,724
But I'm gonna need
more than that.

214
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,303
Oh, Marge!

215
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:41,574
I've only done this before
with Monopoly money and salami!

216
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,377
Where'd it go?

217
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,513
It's all right here, baby.

218
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,218
We made $1,000 today.

219
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,120
What's that
without the cost of goods?

220
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,555
$998.

221
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,290
I love you.

222
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,728
<i>Ain't it beautiful</i>

223
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:06,333
<i>Crystal blue persuasion</i>

224
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:15,675
<i>Better get ready</i>

225
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:20,180
<i>Gonna see the light</i>

226
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:25,152
<i>Love, love is the answer</i>

227
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,622
<i>And that's all right</i>

228
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,395
<i>So don't you give up now</i>

229
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,867
<i>So easy to find</i>

230
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,604
<i>Just look to your soul</i>

231
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,273
<i>Look to your soul</i>

232
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:49,376
<i>And open your mind</i>

233
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:16,837
<i>Crystal blue persuasion</i>

234
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,374
So, those crystals

235
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,377
must really be uncloggin'
your noggin, huh?

236
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,981
Yep. They're making
math problems like 60 + 63

237
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:29,649
as easy as 1-2-3.

238
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,886
And what is 60 + 63?

239
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,123
It's 1-2-3!

240
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:38,091
Ay, caramba!

241
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:41,094
I'll figure out your scam.

242
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:42,429
Sorry, Lis,

243
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:45,765
I can't hear you over the bowl.

244
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:50,270
You won't get away with it!

245
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,005
I will stop you!

246
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,341
Because this is not...

247
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:57,344
Singing bowl,

248
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,813
you are so peaceful.

249
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:03,516
Luann bought $60 worth

250
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,018
of organic blackberries today.

251
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:07,220
I hope she enjoys both of them.

252
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,523
I need this for shopping.

253
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:13,360
And this for a rainy day.

254
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:16,696
Do I hear thunder?

255
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,033
Namaste.

256
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,035
We're closed.

257
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:25,939
What part of namaste
don't you understand?

258
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,707
I'm gonna need you to can it,
Marge.

259
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,376
My name is Piper Paisley.

260
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,610
Do I know you?

261
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,213
I have a healing beauty
relaxorium in Shelbyville.

262
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,714
Perhaps you've heard of PLOP.

263
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:38,485
Well, it's wonderful
to meet a fellow entrepreneuse.

264
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,720
Is it?
If I wasn't Botoxed as hell,

265
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,755
I'd be frowning
at you right now.

266
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:47,827
East?

267
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,396
That's a solstice stone,

268
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,431
not an equinox stone.

269
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:56,703
Just nama-stay out
of my business.

270
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:05,913
Marge, honey,
you've got to be careful.

271
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,680
She means business.

272
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,151
Oh, look what it says.

273
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,986
This means war.

274
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,821
Marge, don't say that!

275
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,257
I got into this business
because of the kids,

276
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,259
but now I like it.

277
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,593
You know what?

278
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:23,931
I'm going to open up a kiosk
in the Shelbyville Mall.

279
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,532
On her turf!

280
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,109
You don't belong there!

281
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:37,710
What happened
to that hoverboard guy?

282
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,812
Marge made me a better offer!

283
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,286
You know you can't
do this, right...

284
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,956
build a competing kiosk in the
same escalator dump-out zone?

285
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:50,123
I mean,

286
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:51,458
you can't.

287
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:54,827
There's no more
law and order in malls.

288
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,867
You've been living in my kiosk?

289
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,735
If you call that living.

290
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,039
Well, well, Bart, another A.

291
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,377
Looks like I brought
my average up to a D.

292
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:30,964
Now to test my theory.

293
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,603
What the hell are you doing?

294
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,338
I know what you did,
Bart Simpson.

295
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,340
It's crystal clear.

296
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,609
You hid the Gettysburg Address

297
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,611
in a poster right by your desk,

298
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:47,880
which you could read when
Milhouse distracted Flanders.

299
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:01,461
Pure coincidence.

300
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,963
I put all the times tables
in Newton's wig.

301
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:06,466
And look what I hid
in the apple.

302
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,970
You know,
it would have been far easier

303
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:13,040
just to study and get an A.

304
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:14,874
Yeah, but what's the point
of that?

305
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,576
I'm telling Dad.

306
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,046
Not today.
I got my book club.

307
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,447
A Confederacy of Dunces.

308
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,881
Ooh, is that the book?

309
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:22,882
No, that's who's coming.

310
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,318
Lenny, Carl, Barney, Moe.

311
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:28,221
The book we read was
The Girl with the Dragon Something.

312
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:30,323
- I didn't get through the title.
- Yeah, me neither.

313
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:33,693
It was just as boring as Tinker
Tailor Something Something.

314
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:34,994
Well, cancel the book club,

315
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:37,797
'cause Bart has something
he has to tell Mom.

316
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,332
Why?

317
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,801
You don't realize
how bad this is, do you?

318
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,572
You betrayed the one person
who still believes in you.

319
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:46,673
The dog believes in me.

320
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,909
Don't you get it?

321
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,512
Who's the person that's
always there when you need it?

322
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,649
<i>I'll always love my mama</i>

323
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,219
<i>She's my favorite girl</i>

324
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,756
<i>I'll always love my mama</i>

325
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,158
Oh, my God.

326
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,759
She's shown me nothing but love.

327
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,661
How do I make this guilt
go away?

328
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:09,929
Tell her the truth.

329
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,498
No, that's not it.
Keep pitching.

330
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,499
No, that is it!

331
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,700
Oh, fine!

332
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,568
Now, looky here.

333
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:18,004
I learned Swedish
to read this here book,

334
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,274
and we are gonna discuss it.

335
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:23,443
Nordic noir is known
for its plain language

336
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,044
and absence of metaphors.

337
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,379
Dig deeper.

338
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:27,714
The novel reflects,

339
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,449
implicitly and explicitly,
gaps between rhetoric

340
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:30,883
and practice in Swedish policy.

341
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:33,853
That'll do nicely.

342
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,123
Who wants cake?

343
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:39,826
I said, who wants cake?

344
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:45,398
Our day of kiosk combat begins.

345
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:48,968
My sisters abuse
Piper's free sample policy.

346
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,972
I smell like the smoking
area of a nice resort.

347
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,974
Schmear me like a bagel.

348
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,311
Now, phase two.

349
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:01,314
The one force no kiosk
can withstand.

350
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:03,483
A confused old person.

351
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,152
Somewhere in me is a yoni egg.

352
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:06,653
I think it might be hatching.

353
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,321
They don't hatch.

354
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:10,690
Can you take that chance?

355
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,895
Mom, I'm sorry.

356
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,064
I wasn't getting A's
because of the crystals.

357
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,666
I lied.

358
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,506
This crystal don't work!

359
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,508
Nelson got detention,

360
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:32,745
and I got demoted
from stripper to topless valet.

361
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,081
Kirk crawled over these
and made his way to me.

362
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,516
Three times.

363
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:40,387
One last thing to do.

364
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:44,357
That's not the egg
I was thinking of.

365
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,025
Keep looking.

366
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,461
Stop, stop. Piper, stop.

367
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:49,996
You win.

368
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,964
I don't belong in this mall

369
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:55,134
with all these
legitimate businesses.

370
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,371
I win!

371
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:00,039
I win. Me.

372
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,041
I'm sorry, I'm just...
I'm very competitive.

373
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,710
Have you tried rose quartz?

374
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:06,213
Let me ask you something.
Do I look like an idiot?

375
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,381
Ooh, I love your handbag.

376
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,782
Well, thank you.

377
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,018
No prob, babe. I win.

378
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:21,127
Marge, honey,
I'm glad you're home.

379
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,562
I've been thinking.

380
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:26,132
I want to be more than
just Mr. Mrs. Homer Simpson.

381
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,734
I want to get a job.

382
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,402
You have a job.

383
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:32,004
I know. Raising the kids
and looking fabulous.

384
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:33,406
But I thought it would be nice

385
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,742
to have somewhere to go
every day.

386
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,410
You work at the power plant.

387
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:40,247
They call every morning and say,
where are you?

388
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,514
So you're not mad?

389
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,350
Oh, I love you!

390
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:44,751
Thank you for understanding.

391
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:56,996
Excuse me.

392
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,165
I have a friend I think is here.

393
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,001
I just wanted
to make sure she's okay.

394
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,003
Marge. Good to see you.

395
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,005
But, really, not necessary.

396
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,774
Because everything here is...

397
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,076
Run! Run!

398
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:12,579
What's happening here?!

399
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:14,247
I thought you were just
getting massages!

400
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:15,615
Those were good.

401
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,450
But the other stuff is...

402
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,421
Blow up the bridge.
