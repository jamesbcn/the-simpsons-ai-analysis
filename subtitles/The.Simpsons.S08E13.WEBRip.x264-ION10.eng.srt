I was just with Dr. Hibbert.

109
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,732
He said I was under
a lot of stress

110
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,524
and should get some help.

111
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,687
Marge, whatever it takes
to make you well, we'll do it.

112
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:23,867
Well, I was thinking we could
hire a nanny to help me out.

113
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:27,288
-A nanny?
-But how am I supposed to pay for that?

114
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,748
We'll find a way.

115
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,708
Mom has made
so many sacrifices for us

116
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,788
it's time we gave up
something for her.

117
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,924
I'll stop buying
Malibu Stacie clothing.

118
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,301
And I'll take up smoking
and give that up.

119
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,918
Good for you, son.

120
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,085
Giving up smoking
is one of the hardest things

121
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,764
you'll ever have to do.

122
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,142

123
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,718
But he didn't
do anything.

124
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,643
Didn't he, Lisa?
Didn't he?

125
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,023
Hey, wait a minute.
He didn't!

126
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,600
Homie, please.
I never ask for much,

127
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,896
but this is something
I really need.

128
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,400
All right, Marge.

129
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,732
I'll get you your nanny.
And to pay for it,

130
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,527
I'll give up the civil war
re-creation society I love so much.

131
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:08,243

you're looking for a nanny.

00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,842
-Pleased to meet you.
-Wait a minute, Marge.

138
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,635
I saw "Mrs. Doubtfire."

139
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,888
This is a man in drag!

140
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,430
You're phony.

141
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,524
Fakey phoney broad!
Gimme those!

142
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,690
Homer, if you're going
to do this to every applicant,

143
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,979
we're never going
to find one.

144
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,482
Sorry.

145
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,903

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,280
I'm here about
the nanny job.

148
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,200
I'll keep a watchful eye
on your kids,

149
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,818
and if they get
out of line... pow!

150
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,366
I like him.

151
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,829
Thanks. Where do you
keep the liquor?

152
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,619
I hide a bottle of schnapps
in the baby's crib.

153
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,252
I'm sorry, young man.

154
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,749
You're not
what we're looking for.

155
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,371
You're telling me,
you blue-haired witch.

156
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,787
I heard that!

157
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:01,915
I guess we're not going
to find anyone.

158
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,514
We have our own suggestions
for the new nanny.

159
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,839

but I don't know where

183
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,717
we're going to find
anyone like that.

184
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,216
(coughing)

185
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,314
Whoo-whoo-whoo!

186
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,161
Hello.
I'm Shary Bobbins.

187
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,621
Did you say Mary Pop--

188
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,080
No, I definitely did not.

189
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,250
I'm an original creation
like Rickey Rouse

190
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,619
and Monald Muck.

191
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,285
Now, as your nanny,

192
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,634
I'll do everything
from telling stories

193
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,039
to changing diapers.

194
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,047
Put me down
for one of each.

195
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,299
Now, Miss Bobbins,
if you want this job,

196
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,506
you're going to have
to answer a few questions.

197
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,216
First, do you have
any bad habits?

198
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,226
No. I'm practically perfect
in every way.

199
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,519
Well, so am I.

200
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,363
(gulping loudly)

201
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,228
(belching)
Ah!

202
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,275
(sighs)
Okay. Question two.

203
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,990
Who was your last employer?

204
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,160
Lord and Lady Huffington
of Sussex.

205
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,279
(whispers)
Marge, do we know them?

206
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,986
-No.
-Come on. Isn't he the guy I bowl with?

207
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,867
-The black guy?
-That's Carl.

208
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:43,124
Oh, yeah! So you worked
for Carl, eh?

209
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,327
I have a question.
Pop quiz, hotshot.

210
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,378
I'm supposed
to be doing my homework,

211
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,841
but you find me upstairs
reading a <i>Playdude.</i>

212
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,882
What do you do?
What do you do?

213
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,468
I make you read every
article in that magazine,

214
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,814
including Norman Mailer's
latest claptrap

215
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,559
about his waning libido.

216
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,141
Ooh. She is tough.

217
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,937
Shary Bobbins, you're just
what we're looking for.

218
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,112
Very well.
Come along, children.

219
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,109
(penny whistle blows)

220
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,121
My, she seems too good
to be true.

221
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,412
I'll say. Her butt waxed
the bannister.

222
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,166
Ooh! I can see myself.

223
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,829
All right, children.

224
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,037
Let's clean up this room.

225
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,917
-Oh, man!
-Do we have to?

226
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,844
Now, now.
I know a little secret

227
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,012
that will make the job
go twice as fast.

Aye. Shary Bobbins and I

267
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,775
were engaged to be wed
back in the old country.

268
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,161
Then she got her eyesight back.

Only here and in Mississippi.

278
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:31,388
Oh, Shary Bobbins,
this is ever so much fun.

279
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,017

00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,901
