and all you have to do
is deliver a package.

181
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:49,298
But... you cannot look
inside the package.

182
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,715
Sure. For Marge, I will make
the supreme sacrifice

183
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,385
of not doing something.

184
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,523
(humming)

185
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,234
That's the "package."

186
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,484
What package?

187
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,725
The package you're delivering.

188
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,026
Ooh.

189
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,989
And the clients
have asked me once more

190
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,779
to remind you not to look inside.

191
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,164
Hey, buddy,
I didn't start doing this yesterday!

192
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,332
I started doing it right now.

193
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,084
Uh... the package?

194
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,792
Hmm.

195
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,964
Paris! I can't believe it!

196
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,127
Homer Simpson,

197
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,465
just when I think you have
nothing left to offer,

198
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,510
you whisk me to the birthplace
of existentialism.

199
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,386
Now, if you'll excuse me,

200
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,063
it's an 11-hour flight,

201
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,101
and I have to visit the "Louvre."

202
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,805
(chuckles)

203
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,055
(Marge humming)

204
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,900
(annoyed chatter)

205
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,243
MAN:
Can't see the movie now.

206
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,898
<i>HOMER:</i>
<i>Everything's great.</i>

207
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,696
<i>Absolutely great.</i>

208
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,240
<i>Yet, there's something</i>
<i>in that briefcase,</i>

209
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,703
<i>and it could get us in trouble.</i>

210
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,993
<i>My mind's running wild.</i>

211
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,076
<i>And you're not supposed</i>
<i>to run on an airplane.</i>

212
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,541
<i>Oh, that's it,</i>
<i>I have to open the briefcase.</i>

213
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,880

214
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:06,882

215
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,763
Oh, what a cute, blue sna...

216
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,340
(muffled grunts)

217
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,062
(hyperventilating)

218
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,230
Okay.

219
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:22,398
<i>(thinking) First thing, I gotta figure out</i>
<i>if it can breathe in there.</i>

220
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,482
D'oh!

221
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,356
Hmm. Better try the other eye.

222
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,572
D'oh!

223
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,362
Okay, maybe the first eye again.

224
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,655
What the...?

225
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,948
I found it.

226
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,911
It's an Amazon Blue Constrictor.

227
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,582
Ooh, it's a very rare
and endangered species.

228
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,582
Oh, the trip of a lifetime.

229
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,375
(sighs)

230
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,498
(whispering)
I can't break her heart.

231
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,546
(whispering)
Well, you can't let anything bad

232
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,169
happen to that snake.

233
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,506
I promise.

234
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,471
And you have to promise
to preserve

235
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,601
another endangered species...
my marriage.

236
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,309
I promise.

237
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,889
Oh, for the first time,
a snake has ruined paradise.

238
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,528
I'll get the luggage.

239
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,281
Marge, you and the kids grab a cab.

240
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,362
A Parisian cab.

241
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,368
(French accent)
Taxi. Taxi.

242
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,450
(giggles)
Taxi.

243
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,040
Are you casual courier
Homer Simpson?

244
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,122
I am.

245
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,706
Here is your money.

246
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,501
Finally. I've been
here for two minutes.

247
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:31,295
Listen, what's gonna happen
to, uh, the package?

248
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,130
Oh, it will have a fine home.

249
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,925
A wonderful home.

250
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,799
As the belt around the waist
of a well-dressed woman.

251
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,387
I am not gonna let you
hurt that snake!

252
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:47,024
You have to say "Lisa, catch"
before you throw it.

253
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,734
-Come on.
-(grunts)

254
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,065
Where did they go?

255
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,992
Maybe we shouldn't have stopped
for that seven-course meal.

256
00:10:56,072 --> 00:11:00,452
Oh, maybe we should just
have six, like peasants!

257
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,405
So, back home we call this
the tire fire.

258
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,375
<i>♪ ♪</i>

259
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,054
Man, look at those gargoyles.

260
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,386
That's from back when religions still knew

261
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,602
how to scare the crap out of you.

262
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,103
Homie, I have to ask.

263
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,404
Why are you carrying
that briefcase?

264
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,768
I just brought a little work.

265
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,265
You don't even bring
your work to work.

266
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,397
(grunts)

267
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,613
I'm sorry.
I just want this family

268
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,204
to have one trip that's great.

269
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,029
Not like Australia or Brazil,

270
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,986
Japan, London,

271
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:45,706
China,
that World's Fair Bart drove to,

272
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,998
that place with
the underground jockeys...

273
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,792
So, Dad, what are you
gonna do with the snake?

274
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,496
...Itchy and Scratchy Land,

275
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,046
outer space...

276
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,840
Lisa, I've come to understand

277
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,633
a snake's natural habitat
is not a briefcase.

278
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,638
So I'm going to set him free.

279
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,260
Oh, may I suggest
the gardens of the Louvre?

280
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,557
-They're filled with delicious rats.
-(man screams)

281
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,231
Whoo-hoo!

282
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,107
It's a shame Lisa and your father
had that errand

283
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,322
and couldn't join us.

284
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,822
But on the upside...

285
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,493
more pâté please!

286
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,282
<i>Vraiment?</i>
You want more pâté?

287
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,286
Yes, before my cruelty-free daughter
shows up.

288
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,369
Perhaps madam would like
to order from our

289
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,325
extra cruelty menu.

290
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,325
We have <i>coq au vin</i> made
from an old rooster

291
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,248
who was kicked to death
in front of his wife and children.

292
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,507
Very nice.

293
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,509
On second thought,
I'll just have a salad.

294
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,892
Ah, <i>très bien.</i>

295
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,548
Gilles, gouge the eyes out
of some new potatoes!

296
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:47,057
Ugh, I can't stand to look
at this anymore.

297
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,441
Bart, can you ditch this
in the alley for me?

298
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,279
(glass clattering)

299
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,873

Starving models.

302
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,697
Well, Bart Simpson never met

303
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,958
a beautiful woman
he couldn't prank.

304
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,130
Dad, I love being on a caper
in France with you.

305
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,050
Well, this is gonna be a snap.

306
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,048
All we need is to get our tickets

307
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,880
