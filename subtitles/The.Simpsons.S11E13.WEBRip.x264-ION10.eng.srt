I told you they could deep fry my shirt.

164

I didn't say they couldn't.
I said you shouldn't.

00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,619
You got to stop being so trusting, Chief.

183
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,206
I'd rather let 1,000 guilty men go free

184
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,132
than chase after them.

185
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,001
All right, show's over, folks.

186
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,377
I'm afraid this horse is going

187
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,844
to the dog food factory.

188
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,344
Good luck getting a horse to eat dog food.

189
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,886
You can't do that to Duncan.

190
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,059
It's not his fault
that his owner was a sleaze.

191
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,428
Look, I just want the horse

192
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,885
to have a good home or be food.

193
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,975
If you want to take him, fine with me.

194
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,904
Hmm.

195
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,275
Should the Simpsons get a horse?

196
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,573
Excuse me, but I believe

197
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,406
this family already had a horse

198
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,241
and the expense forced Homer
to work at the Kwik-E-Mart

199
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,997
with hilarious consequences.

200
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,963
Anybody care what this guy thinks?

201
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,170
ALL: No!

202
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,210
Tunnel!

203
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,335
(neighs)

204
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,876
(neighs)

205
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,561
Oh, my. Oh.

206
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:19,768
It's going to cost us $500
a week to keep Duncan.

207
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,940
But he'll bring us joy, Marge--

208
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,849
unlike all your silly gewgaws.

209
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,268
At least you don't have to feed

210
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,726
any of the stuff I bought at the fair...

211
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,317
Well, except the mop.

212
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,277
(chomping)

213
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,914
Marge, your pro-mop, anti-horse agenda

214
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,701
has been clear for some time.

215
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,504
But don't worry, I have a way
for Duncan to earn his keep.

216
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,789
(whinnying)

217
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,963
Mm, that's terrific, Duncan.

218
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,803
You're 10 for 10.

219
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,298
Now let's look in the rule book

220
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,970
and see if horses can play in the NFL.

221
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,009
D'oh!

222
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,182
{\an8}He's a diving horse--

223
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,600
{\an8}maybe he could dive for pearls.

224
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,258
Pearls, eh?

225
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,484
Breakfast is served.

226
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,477
(chomping)

227
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,776
(laughing)

228
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,407
-Hey, Dad?
-Huh?

229
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,413
This horse is pretty fast.

230
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,914
Maybe we can race him.

231
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,956
Racehorse, eh?

232
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,211
(laughing)

233
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,464
Dear Mr. President...

234
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,875
What are you doing, Lisa?

235
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,633
Writing a letter to President Clinton

236
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,425
about that travesty of a band contest.

237
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,639
As a fellow sax player,
I'm sure he'll be outraged.

238
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,811
Honey, don't get obsessed with that.

239
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,520
Focus on the good things--

240
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
like this fire extinguisher
I got at the fair...

241
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,475
Mom, really it's...
Hey, what are you doing?

242
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,113
It's the only fire extinguisher

243
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,652
endorsed by both Lynda Carter
and George Foreman.

244
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,367
I wonder what would happen
if they had a baby?

245
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,079
(laughing hysterically)

246
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,412
Dad, if we're going to race Duncan

247
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,207
shouldn't we hire a professional trainer?

248
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,580
Son, I learned everything I needed to know

249
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,208
from <i>The Horse Whisperer.</i>

250
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,304
Step one-- seduce a lonely housewife.

251
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,381
Ma'am.

252
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,386
Now for the actual horse whispering.

253
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:22,007
When the race starts, run really fast.

254
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,436
Aw, come on! Come on!
There's got to a winner

255
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,650
on this floor somewhere.

256
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,555
Bingo!

257
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,068
Hey, let go, you lousy, stinkin'...

258
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,990
{\an8}What?

259
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,198
You're...

260
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,241
beau-tee-full.

261
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,655
(thumping loudly)

262
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,703
Uh-oh. This is a serious medical problem.

263
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,867
Uh, I got to go.

264
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,745
Just once I'd like to ride clockwise.

265
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,634
Really? I thought I was the only one.

266
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,381
-(air horn blaring)
-(whinnying)

267
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,724
Champion horse coming through.

268
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,339
-What the...
-(air horn blaring)

269
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,216
Good horse. Here's one taco

270
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,353
and you'll get another when you win.

271
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,181
Hey, where do you get those
metal dealies for his feet?

272
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,267
You mean horseshoes?

273
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,942
Hey, what's with the attitude?
I just want some dealies.

274
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,521
You really think that horse can
run a mile and a half?

275
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,647
He ran all the way here.

276
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,195
(playing "Call To Post")

277
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,028
You can do it, Duncan.

278
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,368
I don't care if your odds are...

279
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,124
five million to one? Oh...

280
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,456
Don't worry, boy.

281
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,211
I'll love you even if you don't win.

282
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,793
(snorting)

283
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,509
That horse better win

284
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:42,091
or we're taking a trip to the glue factory

285
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,848
and he won't get to come.

286
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,009
Yeah, that's a great tour,

287
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,177
but you can't see it all in one day.

288
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,806
-Hey, be quiet.
-(bell rings)

289
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,393
TRACK ANNOUNCER: <i>And away they go!</i>

290
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,098
-Go, Duncan!
-Go, number five!

291
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,228
-Go number five!
-Do it for Lenny!

292
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,444
It's Chock Full o' Drugs,

293
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,943
followed closely by Stalker

294
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,315
with Old Levis fading fast.

295
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,702
What's this?

296
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,449
Number five, Duncan,

297
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,950
the horse no one expected to do anything

298
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,373
isn't doing anything!

299
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,451
He hasn't even left the starting gate!

300
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,946
Come on, boy. I know you're scared,

301
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:09,998
but you can do this.

302
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,330
I believe in you!

303
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,253
(neighing)

304
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,415
Would you look at this?

305
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,253
The straggler, Duncan,

306
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,048
has exploded out of the gate

307
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,761
and is making a big move!

308
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:24,051
He's showing more heart
than any horse I've ever seen!

309
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,756
What a shame the race is already over.

310
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,217
(camera shutter clicking)

311
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,941
Hmm.

312
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:35,895
Cheer up, son.

313
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:36,981
I thought you looked

314
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,726
damn good out there.

315
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,738
Oh, wait.

316
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,529
You were number five?

317
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,372
Ew! You st...

318
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,238
Damn good.

319
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,501
(both laughing)

320
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,038
Duncan's really fast, Dad.

321
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,171
He was just intimidated
by those other horses.

322
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,089
Well, he's not going
to be intimidated anymore.

323
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,548
We're going to toughen him up.

324
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,339
Give him a new bad-ass attitude.

325
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,552
All those other horses will be shaking

326
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,593
in their horse dealies.

327
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,351
Hello. I'd like to speak
to President Clinton, please.

328
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,770
I wrote to him, and he never wrote back.

329
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,850
No, I don't want Al Gore.

330
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,225
Lisa, you've got to learn
that life isn't always fair.

331
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,273
Try to channel your disappointment

332
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,897
into something creative

333
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,284
like a sampler.

334
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,239
(screaming)

335
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,491
Is that Duncan?

336
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,873
Not anymore.

337
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,029
Ladies, say hello to...

338
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,738
MARGE: Furious D?

339
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,118
He's the bad boy of racing.

340
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,624
He's got attitude and bad-itude.

341
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,826
So show him some latitude

342
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,125
and you'll win his gratitude.

343
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,288
-Only in America.
-Ew!

344
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,667
You used my bracelet for a nose ring!

345
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,094
Possessions are fleeting.

346
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,928
Why, look at that disgraceful beast.

347
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,313
Good lord.

348
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,139
What has become of the sport of kings?

349
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,274
Get bent.

350
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,770
(gasps)

351
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,442
{\an8}That's my third monocle this week.

352
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,810
{\an8}I simply must stop being so horrified.

353
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,440
So many horses.

354
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,896
I don't know who to vote for.

355
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,407
Can't I just bet that all the horses

356
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,738
will have a fun time?

357
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,623
Yeah, I think you want that line.

358
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,656
Whoa. He looks scary.

359
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,708
Yeah, I'm shaking in my silks.

360
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,341
-(shuddering)
-(both laughing)

361
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,919
Don't listen to them, D. Just remember,

362
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,594
you've got a new persona.

363
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,552
A new per-so-na.

364
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,721
-(bell rings)
-ANNOUNCER: <i>And away they go.</i>

365
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,264
(cheering)

366
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,518
OK, Lisa, I've got
Furious D across the board

367
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,141
boxed with the three and the eight

368
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,977
and wheeled up and down.

369
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,983
Mom, I think you might be
developing a gambling problem.

370
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,396
Hey, I'm watching you.

371
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,444
They're tightly bunched

372
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,986
as they round the far turn.

373
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,200
Wait a minute.

374
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,029
Hang on to your monocles

375
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,574
'cause Furious D

376
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,238
is closing like a horse possessed.

377
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,617
(yelling)

378
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,365
Ahh!

379
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,459
That's it, D. Don't let anyone
push you around.

380
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,291
Be as bad as you want to be.

381
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,627
-And the winner-- Furious D.
-(bell rings)

382
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,301
(snorting) (whinnying)

383
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,684
Oh, man, that horse
don't take no guff from nobody.

384
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,892
-BOTH: Guff?
-I mean, sh...

385
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,476
Whoo-hoo!

You're quite a trainer, Mr. Simpson.

400
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,718
Care to join us for a beer
in the jockey's lounge?

But you're respected athletes.

414
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,923
You own car dealerships

415
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,343
All a lie.

416
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,091

00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,633

Ah! (whimpers)

437
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,243
Did that really happen

438
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,608
or was it just a wonderful dream?

439
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,775
No dream. Lose the race, fat boy.

440
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:36,784

441
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,235
HOMER: Son, don't ask why

442
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,905
but you have to lose the big race.

443
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,373
You want me to lose the Springfield Derby?

444
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,294
But you always taught me
that winning was everything.

445
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,754
Oh, it is, it is,

446
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:51,165
but we've been pushing
that poor horse too hard.

447
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,375
{\an8}Maybe, but, if Duncan wins the derby

448
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,625
{\an8}he can spend the rest
of his days as a stud.

449
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,757
Well, it is a good life, believe me...

450
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,256
(chuckles)

451
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,387
All right. We'll give it a shot.

452
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,694
I'll deal with those murderous trolls.

453
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,058
{\an8}-Huh?
-I mean...

454
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,515
I'll deal with those murderous trolls.

Furious D takes the early lead.

Ow! Ooh! Oh!

462
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,077
ANNOUNCER: <i>What a shameful display</i>

463
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,746

Ow! Ack! Ow!

467
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,474
Oh, I, uh... what's going on?

468
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,814
(screaming)

469
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,389
Could it be? In a bizarre twist,

470
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,484
a horse is abusing a jockey.

471
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,770
Might this be the start of

472
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,903
a terrifying Planet of the Horses?

473
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,400
In this announcer's opinion,
almost certainly yes,

474
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,153
and away I go.

475
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,275

Do it for the normals!

00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,985
-(bell ringing)
-(audience cheering)

480
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:07,077
I can't stress enough how easy it was

481
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,634
to win this prestigious race
and furthermore...

482
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,757
{\an8}Hollywood is leading our kids
down a moral sewer. Got to go.

483
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,473

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,480
You must die!

487
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,098
Hey, need any help, Homer?

488
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,268
No, we're cool.

489
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,484
Marge, now!

490
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,909

00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,028
(moans and groans)

492
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,655
Son, go get me a trash bag.

493
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,407
-Hey!
-Let us out!

494
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,285
-Let me out of here!
-Please!

495
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,792
We'll give you gold!

496
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,753
Now that you're champion

497
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,753
{\an8}you have your pick of the fillies.

498
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,670
(whinnying)

499
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,173
(whinnying)

500
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,678
Yeah, she's the best.

501
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,509
Whoo, can you imagine
her face on her body?

502
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,136
-(snorts)
-(doorbell ringing)

503
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,097
President Clinton?

504
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,564
Yeah, hi. I'm here to see Lisa Simpson.

505
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,685
(gasps) You read my letter?

506
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,362
Much of it, yeah,

507
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,150
and those glow-sticks
were wrong, very wrong.

508
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,355
So I've personally overturned the results

509
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,815
of that band contest.

510
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:22,985
-Congratulations.
-(gasps)

511
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,453
Thank you, Mr. President.

512
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,033
No, thank you, Lisa,

513
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,698
for teaching kids everywhere

514
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,906
a valuable lesson.

515
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,536
If things don't go your way

516
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,422
just keep complaining
until your dreams come true.

517
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,210
That's a pretty lousy lesson.

518
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,844
Hey, I'm a pretty lousy president.
