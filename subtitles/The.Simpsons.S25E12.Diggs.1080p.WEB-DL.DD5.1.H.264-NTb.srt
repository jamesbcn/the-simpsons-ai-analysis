D'oh!

Mmm!

17
00:01:22,506 --> 00:01:23,825
Maggie?

18
00:01:23,974 --> 00:01:24,907
Maggie!

19
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:26,609
Maggie?

20
00:01:26,723 --> 00:01:27,670
Maggie!

21
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:29,015
Mmm!

22
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,593
(honking)

23
00:01:36,257 --> 00:01:37,657
Mmm!

24
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:40,679
(groans, growls)

25
00:01:40,707 --> 00:01:41,687

28
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:49,916
Hmm...

29
00:01:50,563 --> 00:01:52,097
Maggie?

30
00:01:52,386 --> 00:01:53,901
- Maggie!
- Hmm.

31
00:01:54,554 --> 00:01:55,757
Hey!

32
00:02:01,107 --> 00:02:02,739
Maggie!

33
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,573
And it's for all these
reasons and more

34
00:02:20,593 --> 00:02:25,864
that the Kingdom of Moab is the
least interesting in the Bible.

35
00:02:25,899 --> 00:02:27,159
Amen.

36
00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:28,781
Amen! We're done!

37
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,390
Allow me to introduce
our guest speaker

38
00:02:32,415 --> 00:02:35,455
- (Homer groans) - from the
ill-advised mission in Indonesia,

39
00:02:35,474 --> 00:02:38,281
the Reverend Kartawijaya.

40
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,585
(Bart groans)

41
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,517
- I know how you feel, young man.
- Huh?

42
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:45,633
The children in my village
are just like you.

43
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:48,713
One boy, named Sumadi,
never comes to church.

44
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:51,781
He is always tying <i>the
monkeys' tails together</i>

45
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:55,794
<i>and yelling, "Tiger is gone,"
when, in fact, tiger is there.</i>

46
00:02:55,815 --> 00:02:59,502
- Hmm!
- Unfortunately, Sumadi is sick now.

47
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:01,811
What?! Su-Sumadi
has a problem?

48
00:03:01,835 --> 00:03:04,430
Sumadi and others
equally doe-eyed...

49
00:03:04,444 --> 00:03:06,517
need urgent medical
treatment.

50
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:09,420
After all, we are all
just children of Allah.

51
00:03:09,442 --> 00:03:12,415
I mean God. Sorry.
Recent convert.

52
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:13,855
Poor Sumadi.

53
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:16,543
Born in such a
terrible country.

54
00:03:16,556 --> 00:03:18,708
- Now, wait a minute.
- But good news.

55
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:22,006
To help him, we will now
have a second collection.

56
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:23,629
(congregation groans)

57
00:03:23,649 --> 00:03:25,655
Wasn't our sympathetic
nodding enough?

58
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:26,932
Mom, can I have
some money?

59
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:28,812
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm all out.

60
00:03:28,832 --> 00:03:32,623
I spent all I had lighting that
candle for Great Aunt Betty.

61
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,427
I hope that wasn't somebody's
Aunt Betty or something.

62
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:40,212
Dad, please?
For Sumadi?

63
00:03:40,232 --> 00:03:43,251
Sorry, son, I only have 20s.
And if God needs money,

64
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:45,244
why doesn't he just
write another Bible?

65
00:03:45,264 --> 00:03:46,731
The first one sold
pretty well.

66
00:03:46,753 --> 00:03:50,774
Does anyone remember when it was
considered rude to talk in church?

67
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:52,423
Pipe down, Ned.

68
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:55,868
Please?

69
00:03:58,978 --> 00:04:02,247
All right, son, but you
have to pay me back.

70
00:04:04,524 --> 00:04:05,211
(sighs)

71
00:04:05,236 --> 00:04:06,563
Life is good.

72
00:04:06,585 --> 00:04:07,952
- Do you have my money?
- What?

73
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:09,612
- Do you have my money?
- How could I?

74
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:11,606
Right, right, too soon.

75
00:04:12,157 --> 00:04:13,900
- Do you have my money?
- (groans)

76
00:04:16,262 --> 00:04:18,001
Seriously, do you
have my money?

77
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,145
Where's my money?

78
00:04:20,986 --> 00:04:22,062
Huh?

79
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,704
(slurping)

80
00:04:28,254 --> 00:04:29,354
Where's my money?

81
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,996
Where's... my...

82
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:35,378
mon... ey?

83
00:04:35,614 --> 00:04:37,394
It's been a rough
patch, man.

84
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:39,011
Hope you got something
to cheer me up.

85
00:04:39,032 --> 00:04:44,420
Well, there is one fun fact I've been
saving for an emergency situation.

86
00:04:44,436 --> 00:04:47,305
Did you know there really
was a Duncan Hines?

87
00:04:47,332 --> 00:04:49,359
Where's my money? Do you have
my money? Where is it?

88
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:51,930
You know, if you had the
money, I'm right here.

89
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,179
Do you have the money?
Money-money-money-money-mon...

90
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,740
Homer, quit
badgering the boy.

91
00:04:57,757 --> 00:05:01,026
Pressure's how you make your
beloved diamonds, Marge.

92
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:02,914
I don't have any diamonds.

93
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,672
Quit pressuring me!

94
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:09,340
Money, money.
I need money!

95
00:05:09,369 --> 00:05:11,976
Would you eat
anything for money?

96
00:05:11,989 --> 00:05:13,445
I guess.
Who are you?

97
00:05:13,465 --> 00:05:15,785
School play. <i>Damn Yankees.</i>

98
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,669
Children of the playground!

99
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:22,451
I will eat anything
for money!

100
00:05:22,475 --> 00:05:23,748
Except money!

101
00:05:23,776 --> 00:05:26,636
I'll give you a quarter
if you eat my gum.

102
00:05:27,546 --> 00:05:29,991
I'll give you another
if you eat mine.

103
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:33,424
Here's some
orthodontic wax!

104
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:34,746
(lisps):
And some cinnamon!

105
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,297
Saint-John's-wort!

106
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:41,988
And here's something that'll make
you forget about the other stuff.

107
00:05:42,582 --> 00:05:44,115
<i>Ay caramba.</i>

108
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,057
(blubbers)

109
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,132
So, what else you got?

110
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,613
All right, Simpson.

111
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:53,712
20 big ones says you're not
messed-up enough to eat... this.

112
00:05:53,738 --> 00:05:55,479
(laughs)

113
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:56,669
(whimpers)

114
00:05:56,703 --> 00:05:57,422
(gasps)

115
00:05:57,447 --> 00:05:58,847
No, Bart, no!

116
00:05:58,871 --> 00:06:02,961
Do it, and you'll always be known
as the kid who ate the dead frog.

117
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,264
(Homer's voice): Where's my money?
Get my money!

118
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:07,945
Money-money-money-money-money!

119
00:06:12,245 --> 00:06:14,179
(disgusted exclaiming)

120
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,154
(slurps, kids exclaim)

121
00:06:19,585 --> 00:06:21,218
Easiest money I ever...

122
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:22,658
(beeping)

123
00:06:22,714 --> 00:06:25,570
Son, by rights, I should be
playing banjo at your funeral.

124
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:29,540
That frog was filled to the gills with
formaldehyde, a highly toxic poison.

125
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:31,002
(chuckles)

126
00:06:31,276 --> 00:06:33,323
- Here's your money, Dad.
- What?

127
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,553
Did you owe me some money?

128
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:37,708
And, Homer, here's
your bill for $4,000.

129
00:06:37,724 --> 00:06:38,391
D'oh!

130
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:40,804
Where's my money? You got my money?
Where's my money?

131
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:42,354
(chuckles)

132
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,931
Seriously, where's
my money?

133
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:53,822
Ew! It's the kid who
ate the dead frog!

134
00:06:58,997 --> 00:07:00,025
Herbivore!

135
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,092
That's someone
who eats plants.

136
00:07:02,114 --> 00:07:04,249
I named the frog Herb.

137
00:07:04,777 --> 00:07:06,997
Even you won't
sit with me?

138
00:07:07,013 --> 00:07:09,348
Bart, if you sit here,
I'll be the boy

139
00:07:09,368 --> 00:07:12,054
who sat next to the boy
who ate the frog.

140
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,938
And I'm already the boy
who shared a comb with a boy

141
00:07:14,955 --> 00:07:18,825
who threw up on the boy who wet
his pants at the winter carnival.

142
00:07:18,984 --> 00:07:21,231
P.S. I would've given
you the money.

143
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:22,281
(groans)

144
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:24,521
(tires screech)

145
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:28,513
(school bell rings)

146
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,052
(tires squeal)

147
00:07:36,294 --> 00:07:38,454
What's the matter,
frog in your throat?

148
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,410
You're the ones that
paid me to eat it.

149
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:42,701
All we hear is:
Ribbit, ribbit!

150
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:44,823
(bird shrieks)

151
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,088
(exclaiming)

152
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:50,162
You said this was a
simple bullying job!

153
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,299
Diggs and Freedom
at your service.

154
00:07:55,312 --> 00:07:57,001
Diggs is short for Digby.

155
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:59,434
Thanks. I'm the kid
that ate the frog.

156
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:03,162
Oh, so you're the reason I had to
dissect a Muppet in biology today.

157
00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:08,518
Thanks for the help, man.
Oh, you're welcome.

158
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:09,698
At least for me.

159
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:11,479
There's no way to say
what the bird thinks.

160
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:13,820
Or even <i>if</i> he
thinks, really.

161
00:08:14,116 --> 00:08:16,076
Wait, wait, wait!
Who the hell are you?

162
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:17,704
I transferred here
a few months ago.

163
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:19,934
To this school?
On purpose?

164
00:08:19,963 --> 00:08:23,154
Even after Springfield Montessori
opened across the street?

165
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,315
(gentle classical music plays)

166
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:30,790
That place is
really in your face.

167
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:32,354
I like the lack
of attention.

168
00:08:32,376 --> 00:08:33,944
(quietly):
Especially in here.

169
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:39,662
(door creaks softly)

170
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:44,452
This school has a falconry club?

171
00:08:44,471 --> 00:08:45,472
No way.

172
00:08:45,495 --> 00:08:46,958
I resuscitated it.

173
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,443
I'm president, secretary
treasurer and faculty advisor.

174
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:52,479
That took a lot of
fancy paperwork.

175
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:54,990
But it was worth it
to be left alone.

176
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:57,259
Can I join?

177
00:08:57,285 --> 00:08:59,598
Hmm. I'll have to

I saw him heading across
the field after school

Bart Simpson,

(laughs)

226
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:55,932
It's okay if you need
to take a little nap.

227
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,278
Why would I want a nap?

228
00:10:57,307 --> 00:11:00,791
Because you're so drunk you
can barely keep it together.

229
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,761
I wasn't drinking. I was
learning that nature

230
00:11:02,781 --> 00:11:04,702
isn't a complete
waste of space.

231
00:11:04,715 --> 00:11:06,322
That doesn't
sound like you.

232
00:11:06,335 --> 00:11:08,423

like the kind of lie

older, kind of strange.

I don't think other
people get him.

No, I signed them myself.

Um, you want the truth?

313
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,231
Of course you do.
You're like Diogenes.

00:14:49,246 --> 00:14:51,228
But with slingshot
in place of lamp.

315
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:56,059
I wanted to fly.

316
00:14:56,668 --> 00:14:58,786
I know it sounds a
little crazy now,

317
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,313
but I suddenly thought
maybe we can all fly,

318
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:03,259
but somehow we've
forgotten that we can.

319

You don't still
think that, do you?

320
00:15:05,628 --> 00:15:08,411
Hey, I'm not flying anywhere
with this broken wing.

321
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,933
Bart, here's another
doctor that would like

322
00:15:11,946 --> 00:15:13,513
a few words with
this young man.

323
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:17,344
This hospital has
another doctor?

324
00:15:21,406 --> 00:15:23,919
So they're transferring him
to another hospital.

325
00:15:23,941 --> 00:15:26,791
Well, I hope he gets out soon
and takes his bird back.

326
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:29,604
I don't care for how
it circles the cat.

327
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,170
(cat meowing)

328
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,857
He's just riding the
thermals from Dad's butt.

329
00:15:34,877 --> 00:15:37,664
At least someone in this
family is using them.

330
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:41,396
I never heard of this new hospital,
so I looked it up and printed it out.

331
00:15:41,412 --> 00:15:42,692
Ooh!

332
00:15:42,713 --> 00:15:44,480
Can I visit him tomorrow?

333
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,247
(sighs)

334
00:15:45,272 --> 00:15:46,832
I don't know, Bart.

335
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,110
This is one of those Arkham
Asylum-type hospitals.

336
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:52,509
Diggs isn't cuckoo!

337
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,099
Uh, listen, boy.

338
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:57,971
Maybe you should spend more
time with your old best friend.

339
00:15:57,984 --> 00:16:01,749
- You know, Dweebler.
- Milhouse abandoned me.

340
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,659
So, why can't I go there?

341
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:05,814
Bart, if this is
what I think it is,

342
00:16:05,827 --> 00:16:09,666
it's not a place we should
ever, ever take a little boy.

343
00:16:09,693 --> 00:16:11,453
Then why is Diggs there?

344
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:14,653
Because it's his
home forever.

345
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,008
You know, Bart,

346
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,330
just because Diggs
is a little different

347
00:16:21,349 --> 00:16:23,586
doesn't mean
he's not a good person.

348
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,508
What would you know about
friends like Diggs?

349
00:16:25,536 --> 00:16:28,808
- I have about eight of them.
- So, how do we fix him?

350
00:16:28,832 --> 00:16:30,199
Oh, Bart.

351
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,400
Diggs's problems don't
have easy fixes.

352
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:35,650
What kind of cheer-up
talk is this?

353
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,191
Well, sometimes it helps to
know people feel for you.

354
00:16:39,222 --> 00:16:41,257
(chuckles)
Want a hug?

355
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,494
You hug the bedpost.
Then I hug the bedpost.

356
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,290
That way we never
hug each other.

357
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:57,032
♪ Come Saturday morning ♪

358
00:16:57,828 --> 00:17:00,150
♪ I'm going away... ♪

359
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,297
Hey, Simpson.

360
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,656
I heard bird boy
got a new cage.

361
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:05,793
One with rubber bars.

362
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,972
Yeah, and a rubber perch!

363
00:17:07,991 --> 00:17:11,322
- Yeah, yeah, and a...
- I get it. It sucks.

364
00:17:11,342 --> 00:17:14,662
- Really sucks.
- Rubber birdfeeder.

365
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:16,881
Making fun of the
mentally ill...

366
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:18,594
real classy.

367
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:21,626
- But you guys were...
- We were what, Captain Sensitive?

368
00:17:25,316 --> 00:17:28,706
The rumors of my bonkertude
have been greatly exaggerated.

369
00:17:28,725 --> 00:17:30,985
DSM-5 indicates
paranoid schizophrenia,

370
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,401
but that work is mired
in controversy.

371
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,439
- Mired.
- I knew you'd escape!

372
00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:37,441
Were you carried out
by a flock of falcons?

373
00:17:37,468 --> 00:17:38,868
I got a one-day pass.

374
00:17:38,896 --> 00:17:40,489
Were falcons
involved in any way?

375
00:17:40,502 --> 00:17:43,793
I obtained the pass to enter the
Springfield Falconry Contest,

376
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:46,881
which is what Freedom and I were
training for when we first met you.

377
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,963
Oh, great.

378
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:49,931
Before anything else,
let me just get closer

379
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:52,814
to the door and say,
"How crazy are you?"

380
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:55,111
I'm fine. My meds won't
wear off till tonight.

381
00:17:55,138 --> 00:17:58,536
Then I'll have Freedom
tear you to shreds.

382
00:17:58,563 --> 00:18:03,163
No offense, but when a crazy guy
pretends to be crazy, it's not funny.

383
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,920
You're discounting
all talk radio.

384
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:16,040
Excellent.

385
00:18:16,838 --> 00:18:19,354
COMIC BOOK GUY:
Fly, my pet, fly!

386
00:18:19,904 --> 00:18:21,337
Yes!

387
00:18:21,363 --> 00:18:23,737
(falcon cries)
- Yes, now back to Papa.

388
00:18:24,054 --> 00:18:25,451
Yes.

389
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,291
Why am I not surprised
the only sport you do

390
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:31,831
is one where a bird
brings you food?

391
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:35,368
Um, a falcon's greatest joy
is to serve its master.

392
00:18:35,392 --> 00:18:37,099
(squawks) Fatso!

393
00:18:37,121 --> 00:18:40,003
Once again, I must point out
that you are not a parrot.

394
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:42,357
Fatso, fatso!
Pees in the shower!

395
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,137
- (squawks)
- Shut up.

396
00:18:46,944 --> 00:18:49,020
- What are you doing?
- We're up next.

397
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:52,209
When Freedom hits the air, you
and I open all the cages.

398
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:54,918
Um... with our minds?

399
00:18:55,123 --> 00:18:57,243
No. With this rope.

400
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,648
I'm a messed-up kid.
I'm not Magneto.

401
00:19:00,063 --> 00:19:01,880
ANNOUNCER:
Diggs and Freedom.

402
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:12,908
(all squawking)

403
00:19:14,231 --> 00:19:18,238
"In his ecstasy. Then
off, off forth on swing!"

404
00:19:18,268 --> 00:19:19,855
Where's my bird going?

405
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:22,133
Wherever he wants.
He's free now.

406
00:19:22,146 --> 00:19:25,734
If you see the stork what
brings us babies, kill it!

407
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:31,027
Now, Bart, I'm afraid one-day
passes don't last forever.

408
00:19:31,048 --> 00:19:34,708
And I'm probably not going to get
another one for quite a while.

409
00:19:34,726 --> 00:19:35,846
Wait!

410
00:19:35,865 --> 00:19:37,251
Wh-When will I see you?

411
00:19:37,268 --> 00:19:39,241
You can't quit
the falconry club!

412
00:19:39,256 --> 00:19:41,003
It's all yours, Mr. President.

413
00:19:41,032 --> 00:19:45,552
Well, I guess some delicate
birds are safer in a cage.

414
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,883
I had thought of it as
a therapeutic milieu,

415
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:51,254
but now "cage" is stuck
in my head, so thanks.

416
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:53,610
And thanks for
being my friend.

417
00:20:02,245 --> 00:20:04,642
Bart, when I
pushed you away,

418
00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:08,017
I was really pushing away
the thought of losing you.

419
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:10,038
How long did it take
you to think that up?

420
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:12,254
Two hours with the therapist.

421
00:20:12,282 --> 00:20:14,764
- I'll take that.
- She came in on a Saturday.

422
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,299
Missed her kid's
karate demonstration.

423
00:20:17,322 --> 00:20:19,817
- He was going up a belt.
- Enough!

424
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:29,241
Mom, you didn't
cook the falcon?

425
00:20:29,256 --> 00:20:31,656
Of course not.
It's just duck.

426
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:33,240
- Aw.
- Aw.

427
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,567
(munching loudly)

428
00:20:35,882 --> 00:20:37,549
Pass the peas, please.
