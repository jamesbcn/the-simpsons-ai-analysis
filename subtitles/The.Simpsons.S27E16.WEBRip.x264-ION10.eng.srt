totally insane,

are of the egghead loner variety.

350
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,705
Bookworms, teacher's pets,

351
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,843
friendless middle children,
that sort of thing.

352
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,131
(growls)

353
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,013
But you display an amazing ability

354
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,550
to perform repetitive tasks
without getting bored.

355
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,845
Even our robotic arm
gets a little cranky.

356
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,059
-Ow!
-That's two, Lorraine!

357
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,389
(whirs softly)

358
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,684
May I talk to you in private, please?

359
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,404
Admit it-- the only reason
you're here is to support me

360
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,114
until I lose interest and quit.

361
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,784
Well, I'm not going anywhere,

362
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,242
so you can quit.

363
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,372
Maybe I don't want to quit.

364
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:54,749
Do you realize what a big deal it is
to be a space colonist?

365
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,288
Yes! That's why I want to do it!

366
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,753
I think you don't like that
I'm just as good at Mars as you.

367
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,384
Maybe even better.

368
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,881
Ha! Hardly.

369
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,303
All you are is a...

370
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,881
a stay-at-hab space wife!

371
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,047
Hmm.

372
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,394
Well, it looks like the ego has landed.

373
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,971
You're the last person
I would ever want to go to Mars with.

374
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,427
In ten years.

375
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,807
That's too bad,

376
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,193
because I'm going with you.

377
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,480
In ten years.

378
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,743
LISA: On Mars,
that would be a door slam!

379
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,540
Sometimes I feel like Lisa
has no respect for me.

380
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,288
I know, I know.

381
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,040
I'm finally good at something

382
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,332
and she has to make it
into a competition.

383
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,206
That must be really hard for you.

384
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,462
It is.

385
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,094
I'm so sorry you have to go through this.

386
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,591
Thank you.

387
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,973
Mom's always trying to hold me back!

388
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,890
I know, I know.

389
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,259
I can't be her little girl forever.

390
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,096
That must be really hard for you.

391
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,221
It is!

392
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,137
I'm so sorry you have to go through this.

393
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,346
Thank you.

394
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,977
That listening-to-women junk
you taught me really works.

395
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,065
The trick is in the nodding.

396
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,822
Dad, after seeing Mom and Lisa go at it,

397
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,324
I'm glad our relationship
is about physical abuse,

398
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,867
not psychological.

399
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,540
Me, too, boy.

400
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,748
Aw.

401
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,078
This press conference
was originally scheduled

402
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,754
to introduce
our ten Mars mission finalists.

403
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,343
However, our rivals at Space Colony One,

404
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,999
a division of Pepperidge Farms,

405
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:30,467
just announced that their Mars rocket
is nearing completion.

406
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,679
We made a solemn promise to Fig Glutens

407
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,930
that they would be
the first cookie on Mars.

408
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:38,852
Therefore, we have moved up
our launch date from 2026 to...

409
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,102
-Thursday.
-(gasping)

410
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,265
-Thursday?
-This Thursday?

411
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,523
Are you all ready to be
a part of history?

412
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,316
I wanted to be someone

413
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,739
who's bravely going to Mars eventually.

414
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,858
I haven't used
my Open Table dining points!

415
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,735
I'm still very much an alcoholic.

416
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,828
Uh, I-I guess we should leave, too.

417
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,751
-I knew it!
-What?

418
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,869
This has all been an elaborate charade.

419
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,036
You never had the guts to go to Mars.

420
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,995
Oh, I have the guts.

421
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,376
I once went to a rock concert
by myself in the rain.

422
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,054
It was Loverboy.

423
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,182
Then let's go. To Mars.

424
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,929
Yeah, let's go!

425
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,261
To Mars.

426
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,386
-Hmph.
-Hmph.

427
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,595

Mom's my only good parent.

And Lisa's my only good kid!

434
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,744
Why won't they admit that neither of them
actually wants to go to Mars?

435
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,414
I'm not giving up yet.

436
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,992
There's got to be a limit
to their stubbornness, right?

Abort launch!

448
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,610
That's a negative.

-Of course not!

00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,092
We did plan to build a real rocket.

460
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,336
And that's one thing
they can never take away from us.

That plan is our legacy.

462
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,273
Then why did you move up the launch
if you knew it was fake?

463
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,139
To inspire the next generation.

464
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,806
And to provide a distraction
while we drove away.

465
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:52,016
-Then why are you still here?
-Our car wouldn't start.

Mom, doesn't it frighten you
that we almost went to Mars

467
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,367
out of sheer stubbornness?

468
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,619
That's what a mother-daughter
relationship is, sweetie.

469
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,542
A series of near-fatal
emotional standoffs.

470
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,832
Okay, but it doesn't have to be that way.

471
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,666
Surely we can learn from this.

472
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,251
