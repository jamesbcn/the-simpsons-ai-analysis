1
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:13,780
Come on. One more long one
and we can get this thing done.

2
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,288
Congratulations! It's a boy.

3
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,489
What?

4
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,758
Another boy? Plus Bart?

5
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:27,761
That's like introducing
Frankenstein to Dracula.

6
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,129
Or Cheney to Bush.

7
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,898
Or Ben Affleck to anybody.

8
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:33,600
Well, this is unorthodox,
but...

9
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,837
what would you think about
taking a cute baby girl instead?

10
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,641
Her mother died in childbirth.

11
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,076
The father is listed
as 10,000 lunatics,

12
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,178
but none of them
has shown up yet.

13
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,747
- Sold.
- I should warn you, however.

14
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:49,149
We ran the standard
newborn screen on her,

15
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,285
and she tested positive

16
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,687
for evil.

17
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:03,263
Still better than a boy.

18
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,631
Maggie darling,

19
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:07,768
these stuffed animals
are your fuzzy new friends.

20
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,504
And here's
baby's first music box.

21
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:21,348
The cow says...

22
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,951
your mother
dates jocks in hell.

23
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,387
Nemo's just like you.

24
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,690
His mommy died
at the beginning too.

25
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,525
Yes, she did.

26
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,196
Omen!

27
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,466
Palindrome!

28
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,468
Callback!

29
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:44,237
I'm beginning to wonder
if trading for this baby

30
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,674
of unknown origin
was the right thing to do.

31
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,810
Marge, I fed the baby!

32
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,787
The baby is making us
kill ourselves.

33
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:04,157
I thought this suicide
was just gonna be the two of us.

34
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,693
We'll figure it out in hell!

35
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:12,966
Oh, I must stop
this spawn of Satan.

36
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,602
But can I really find it
in my heart to kill a child?

37
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,374
I like Morrissey.

38
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,376
Reality bites.

39
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:25,512
Looks like I'll be digging
three graves.

40
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,617
Ned, stop!

41
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,687
It must be killed.
It bears the mark of the beast.

42
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,659
Sorry, not that one.

43
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,130
What do we do? What do we do?

44
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,970
Still better than a boy.

45
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,641
They'll never improve
on this game.

46
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:36,950
My mom won't let me
see the movie

47
00:03:37,755 --> 00:03:40,524
'cause she thinks
the scientists will scare me.

48
00:03:50,734 --> 00:03:52,436
We'd better go.

49
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:55,239
Parachute pants, activate.

50
00:03:58,175 --> 00:04:00,411
Smell ya later.

51
00:04:00,478 --> 00:04:02,613
<i>Riding all alone</i>

52
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,381
<i>Riding all alone</i>

53
00:04:04,448 --> 00:04:07,151
<i>I shall get back safely...</i>

54
00:04:09,353 --> 00:04:12,323
Dang. I never get to finish
my "Safely" song.

55
00:04:25,603 --> 00:04:28,772
Luann! I need extra cards
for my Rolodex!

56
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,343
As a yuppie,
I'm making lots more friends.

57
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,044
Milhouse still isn't home.

58
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:36,013
And it's 2:00 in the morning.

59
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,048
My Swatch watch says 7:30.

60
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:41,519
See? Squiggle hand
is just past the kissy lips.

61
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:43,521
Wait, no,
that's the zigzag hand.

62
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:45,890
The zig... The zigzag hand?!

63
00:04:45,956 --> 00:04:48,092
Milhouse, where are you?

64
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:52,963
Oh, come on.

65
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,065
Maybe he's in this wall.

66
00:04:55,132 --> 00:04:58,402
Kirk, you're going crazy.

67
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:00,604
Crazy?! Am I?!

68
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:02,506
Does this look crazy
to you, Luann?

69
00:05:03,574 --> 00:05:04,842
Does this?

70
00:05:09,013 --> 00:05:11,048
Your friend's bike crashed here.

71
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:13,183
We found his inhaler here.

72
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,986
And over here
is his final pee stain.

73
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:19,557
He did drink a lot
of New Cokes last night.

74
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:21,559
Look, what the hell year
is this anyway?

75
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,928
I'm really getting confused.

76
00:05:23,994 --> 00:05:26,130
If Milhouse is
in another dimension,

77
00:05:26,196 --> 00:05:29,466
he can communicate with us
by blinking these lights.

78
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:31,669
Come on, Milhouse.
You can do it.

79
00:05:31,735 --> 00:05:33,737
Admit it. Our son is gone.

80
00:05:33,804 --> 00:05:35,739
So, I can tell you.

81
00:05:35,806 --> 00:05:37,308
I've been having an affair.

82
00:05:37,374 --> 00:05:40,477
Is it Milhouse's
break dancing tutor?

83
00:05:40,544 --> 00:05:42,313
Did you tell him yet?

84
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,381
Hold your horses.

85
00:05:47,518 --> 00:05:49,086
Not now, Milhouse!

86
00:05:49,153 --> 00:05:51,322
Mommy and Daddy
are loud talking!

87
00:05:51,388 --> 00:05:52,957
Why don't you go
to your room, sweetie?

88
00:05:56,594 --> 00:05:59,730
Easy on
the electric bill there, son.

89
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:03,767
Hello? Hello?

90
00:06:05,502 --> 00:06:07,171
Is Lisa there?

91
00:06:07,237 --> 00:06:08,739
Milhouse?

92
00:06:08,806 --> 00:06:10,474
That depends.

93
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,610
Do you like Milhouse?

94
00:06:12,676 --> 00:06:16,246
I like Milhouse,
but I don't like like Milhouse.

95
00:06:16,313 --> 00:06:18,248
Wrong number!

96
00:06:24,655 --> 00:06:27,324
Milhouse is alive.
I just talked to him!

97
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:29,793
I think he's in
another dimension.

98
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,730
This is my best game ever.
I'm not leaving till it's done.

99
00:06:32,796 --> 00:06:34,531
Come on, Bart!

100
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:36,467
Fine.

101
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:38,469
You can reach
the parallel dimension

102
00:06:38,535 --> 00:06:41,071
via this
sensory deprivation tank.

103
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:44,408
It requires somebody with
an extraordinary power of mind.

104
00:06:44,475 --> 00:06:45,576
Glavin.

105
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:47,578
Why did you shave your head?

106
00:06:47,645 --> 00:06:49,380
Was it to increase conductivity?

107
00:06:49,446 --> 00:06:51,682
No, I was trying
to give myself bangs

108
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:53,384
and it got away from me.

109
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,653
Now let's do this thing.

110
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:06,897
I made it.

111
00:07:06,964 --> 00:07:09,199
I'm in the Over Under.

112
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:10,968
Yo.

113
00:07:12,102 --> 00:07:13,637
Milhouse!

114
00:07:14,972 --> 00:07:17,341
You could've escaped anytime!

115
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:20,010
It felt nice to be embraced.

116
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:23,347
Okay, here's the secret.

117
00:07:23,414 --> 00:07:25,416
Just hold still
and they can't see you.

118
00:07:25,482 --> 00:07:26,750
See?

119
00:07:26,817 --> 00:07:28,152
We are perfectly, perfectly...

120
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,923
I forgot we're not
supposed to talk either.

121
00:07:33,957 --> 00:07:35,726
Tough luck, dude.

122
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:42,366
Oh, my God!

123
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:45,202
It's a twisted version
of reality.

124
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:51,542
It seems like someone hasn't
seen very much of season three.

125
00:08:01,952 --> 00:08:03,821
How ya doin'?
Say hi to your mom.

126
00:08:11,495 --> 00:08:13,230
I'd better use
my psychic powers.

127
00:08:13,297 --> 00:08:15,399
I didn't know
you had psychic powers.

128
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:16,934
Girls are afraid to use them,

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,602
because then
we're called unfeminine.

130
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:21,772
We needlessly lost a lot
of good witches at Salem.

131
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,378
Now I have the power
to skip gym!

132
00:08:28,445 --> 00:08:30,013
Boo-yeah!

133
00:08:34,017 --> 00:08:35,252
- Dad?
- Quiet, sweetie.

134
00:08:35,319 --> 00:08:37,588
Daddy's at work.

135
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,459
Mr. Burns opened a portal
to another dimension

136
00:08:42,526 --> 00:08:44,928
that released a lot of monsters.

137
00:08:44,995 --> 00:08:46,930
What was he looking for?

138
00:08:46,997 --> 00:08:50,100
It's all part of
a secret government program

139
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:52,102
to find monsters.

140
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:54,705
A monster ate Carl,
but because Carl's inside him,

141
00:08:54,772 --> 00:08:56,206
the monster's my friend.

142
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:59,343
He remembers when we were kids

143
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:01,311
and we used to go down to...

144
00:09:03,514 --> 00:09:05,949
Well, they won't
bother us anymore.

145
00:09:06,016 --> 00:09:07,317
You kids are safe.

146
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:09,620
But we are trapped
in this dimension forever.

147
00:09:09,686 --> 00:09:11,255
Who wants a piggyback ride?

148
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:12,990
Trapped forever?

149
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:14,691
It's not so bad here.

150
00:09:14,758 --> 00:09:17,628
Boy, these vines sure are good
at finding all the holes.

151
00:09:18,896 --> 00:09:21,331
In the Over Under,
housing is affordable,

152
00:09:21,398 --> 00:09:23,033
schools are excellent,

153
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,269
and you can walk to shops
and restaurants.

154
00:09:25,335 --> 00:09:27,271
Does Amazon deliver here?

155
00:09:27,337 --> 00:09:30,507
They have a fleet
of flying monsters.

156
00:09:33,243 --> 00:09:35,179
Well, there is one thing
that's better.

157
00:09:35,245 --> 00:09:36,480
At least there's no stupid...

158
00:09:36,547 --> 00:09:38,315
Howdily-doodily, neighborino!

159
00:09:52,462 --> 00:09:54,598
Well, sir, it's
fourth down and goal to go.

160
00:09:54,665 --> 00:09:57,034
Quarterback Case Diggs
takes the ball.

161
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,269
Hickory dickory dock,
three ticks left on the clock.

162
00:09:59,336 --> 00:10:01,004
He looks. He throws.

163
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:03,407
Intercepted!

164
00:10:03,473 --> 00:10:04,775
The quarterback choked.

165
00:10:04,842 --> 00:10:06,443
Choke, choke, choke!

166
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,679
Choke, choke, choke!

167
00:10:08,745 --> 00:10:10,247
Hot dog!

168
00:10:10,314 --> 00:10:12,282
Choke!

169
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,853
Choke, choke, choke...

170
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,120
Choke, choke...!

171
00:10:17,187 --> 00:10:18,956
Choke, choke, choke!

172
00:10:25,996 --> 00:10:28,732
Homer Simpson,
welcome to Heaven.

173
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,603
Are you Saint Peter?

174
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:37,074
No, I'm Saint Greeter,
if you'll forgive the pun.

175
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,442
I don't forgive it.

176
00:10:38,508 --> 00:10:40,811
Damn you...!

177
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,283
Heaven doesn't look
like I expected.

178
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,518
Yeah. God sold out to Google.

179
00:10:48,585 --> 00:10:51,321
I really wonder
if I did the right thing.

180
00:10:54,258 --> 00:10:56,526
Maybe global warming is real.

181
00:10:56,593 --> 00:10:58,795
Oh, my. This is not good.

182
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:00,797
Not good!
Okay, according to this,

183
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,499
you're not supposed
to be here yet.

184
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:04,101
We have to send you back.

185
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:05,769
I get to see Marge again?

186
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:08,572
And eat that tub of lasagna
I have in the refrigerator?

187
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,274
It better still be there.

188
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,508
Send me back now!

189
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:13,143
Look, I would love to, okay?

190
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,678
But the paramedics
couldn't lift your corpse,

191
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:16,480
so they rolled it into a lake.

192
00:11:16,546 --> 00:11:17,748
Pretty bloated.

193
00:11:17,814 --> 00:11:19,316
Wait.
That's the before picture.

194
00:11:19,383 --> 00:11:20,951
Here's the after picture.

195
00:11:21,018 --> 00:11:23,487
And here's the way
after picture.

196
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:26,390
It's pretty disgusting.

197
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:28,358
You've got to get me
back to Marge.

198
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:29,693
Yeah, okay, got it, got it.

199
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,395
We'll disrupt the paradigm.

200
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:33,563
Homer, we're gonna put you
in the body of someone

201
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,400
who's supposed to die today,
and you can live as them.

202
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:38,568
Can I live
in the body of a pig?

203
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:40,570
I like the freedom
of not wearing pants.

204
00:11:40,637 --> 00:11:43,140
Oh, there's a six-month
waiting list to be a pig.

205
00:11:43,206 --> 00:11:44,708
I'm so sorry.

206
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:46,710
That's all?

207
00:11:46,777 --> 00:11:48,812
Look, just choose
one of these, okay?

208
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,213
No.

209
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,515
No.

210
00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:54,084
Tempting, but no.

211
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,319
No.

212
00:11:55,385 --> 00:11:57,087
Forget it.

213
00:11:57,154 --> 00:11:59,323
That's the one!

214
00:12:01,558 --> 00:12:05,295
Hey, man, I've been
waiting here a long time.

215
00:12:10,634 --> 00:12:11,568
Hello?

216
00:12:11,635 --> 00:12:13,203
Hello, Marge.

217
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,972
How do you know my name?

218
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:17,841
Now, don't freak out,
but it's me, your husband Homer.

219
00:12:17,908 --> 00:12:21,211
I died, and I'm inside the body
of this football player.

220
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:23,981
How could I possibly
believe that?

221
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:27,684
Because I know something about
you that no one else knows.

222
00:12:27,751 --> 00:12:29,853
- What's that?
- I forget.

223
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,255
It's you!

224
00:12:36,927 --> 00:12:38,195
Fat, fit.

225
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:39,629
Portly, sportly.

226
00:12:39,696 --> 00:12:41,798
Jell-O? Hello!

227
00:12:41,865 --> 00:12:46,269
Whatever body you're in,
I love the guy inside.

228
00:12:46,336 --> 00:12:48,638
Oh, my God, I touched an ab.

229
00:12:48,705 --> 00:12:51,041
I didn't think abs were real.

230
00:12:54,644 --> 00:12:57,714
It's really weird snuggling
with the body of a man

231
00:12:57,781 --> 00:12:59,616
who's married to someone else.

232
00:12:59,683 --> 00:13:02,019
Not just someone,
Miss Nude Texas.

233
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:05,756
All right, Marge.
I'll find someone else's body.

234
00:13:05,822 --> 00:13:07,290
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

235
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:16,233
Oh, yeah.

236
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:24,374
Homie? Homie?

237
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:28,812
You ruined that body
in one night?

238
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,815
The funeral leftovers
were so good.

239
00:13:33,183 --> 00:13:35,886
This is too creepy.
I want something else.

240
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:40,657
It's a real tragedy
more young people don't die.

241
00:13:40,724 --> 00:13:43,293
Dad! You could be
Superintendent Chalmers,

242
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,128
my principal's boss.

243
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:46,530
Marge, what do you say?

244
00:13:46,596 --> 00:13:49,299
I would like
to see Chalmers with somebody.

245
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:50,967
He's so lonely.

246
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:52,602
Boom. He's dead.

247
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,441
You wanted to see me, sir?

248
00:13:57,507 --> 00:13:59,376
Skinner!

249
00:13:59,443 --> 00:14:02,879
Because of new school rules,
from now on, Bart gets all A's.

250
00:14:04,948 --> 00:14:06,950
Give yourself a purple nurple.

251
00:14:07,017 --> 00:14:10,287
Purpler. Purpler.

252
00:14:10,353 --> 00:14:11,888
This is pure indigo.

253
00:14:11,955 --> 00:14:13,490
He said, purpler.

254
00:14:13,557 --> 00:14:15,559
Yes, sir.

255
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,261
A toast to my new life

256
00:14:18,328 --> 00:14:20,430
as public school administrator.

257
00:14:20,497 --> 00:14:23,667
And now to open my paycheck
and see what I make.

258
00:14:26,403 --> 00:14:27,938
Next.

259
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:36,346
This has gotten out of hand.

260
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:37,981
You're changing bodies so much,

261
00:14:38,048 --> 00:14:40,951
I don't even know
who I'm married to anymore.

262
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:43,386
Oh, so that's why

263
00:14:43,453 --> 00:14:45,589
I'm rooting for the apes
in Planet of the Apes.

264
00:14:45,655 --> 00:14:48,058
Oh, please, just pick one man

265
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,227
I can be with
for the rest of my life.

266
00:14:50,293 --> 00:14:52,229
He doesn't have to be perfect.

267
00:14:52,295 --> 00:14:55,165
He just has to love me
like you do.

268
00:14:55,232 --> 00:14:58,268
I know just the guy.

269
00:14:58,335 --> 00:15:01,538
Well, I had my doubts,
but this works.

270
00:15:01,605 --> 00:15:05,876
This is great.
My brain in Moe's body.

271
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:07,377
Yeah, and I'm in here.

272
00:15:07,444 --> 00:15:09,779
And, Midge, I'm...

273
00:15:09,846 --> 00:15:11,515
I'm very thirsty.

274
00:15:26,062 --> 00:15:28,431
So, I'm the first person
to ever be fired

275
00:15:28,498 --> 00:15:31,334
by the DMV for a bad attitude.

276
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:33,069
Isn't that something?

277
00:15:33,136 --> 00:15:34,738
Huh? Isn't it?

278
00:15:38,742 --> 00:15:40,243
I need to sneak a smoke.

279
00:15:56,993 --> 00:15:58,895
I am Kang the Conqueror.

280
00:15:58,962 --> 00:16:00,897
I am Selma the available.

281
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:06,336
This is so romantic.

282
00:16:06,403 --> 00:16:07,837
Let me get a look at you.

283
00:16:09,172 --> 00:16:11,274
Oh, you don't like what you see.

284
00:16:11,341 --> 00:16:12,509
Quite the contrary.

285
00:16:12,576 --> 00:16:14,844
Aah is our word
for beautiful.

286
00:16:32,362 --> 00:16:33,930
Freak.

287
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:36,433
Can you turn yourself?

288
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:37,734
We're gonna make out.

289
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:39,436
Just kill me now.

290
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:43,974
What's wrong, my darling?

291
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,677
My sister says you just want
to eat me, or for a green card.

292
00:16:47,744 --> 00:16:49,346
Or a human zoo.

293
00:16:49,412 --> 00:16:51,915
Two of those are ridiculous.

294
00:16:51,982 --> 00:16:53,650
Quick! Hide!

295
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:56,286
Hello. Just want you to know

296
00:16:56,353 --> 00:16:58,321
we'll be dissecting you
tomorrow.

297
00:16:58,388 --> 00:17:01,291
But I could teach you the secret
of clean, natural energy.

298
00:17:01,358 --> 00:17:03,493
Then I'll dissect you tonight.

299
00:17:05,128 --> 00:17:07,430
We have to save you!

300
00:17:07,497 --> 00:17:09,499
What do you want?

301
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:13,303
How'd you like me to go to a
distant galaxy and never return?

302
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,672
You rang?

303
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:26,950
We've come
to get you out, my love.

304
00:17:27,017 --> 00:17:29,019
Oh, we're using
the L word, huh?

305
00:17:29,085 --> 00:17:31,655
Should've been a conversation,
but okay.

306
00:17:33,056 --> 00:17:35,158
This thing is full of rats.

307
00:17:35,225 --> 00:17:36,626
Very thoughtful.

308
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,565
Hold it right there, Simpson.
What are you up to?

309
00:17:42,632 --> 00:17:45,402
I am, you know,

310
00:17:45,468 --> 00:17:47,737
cover story,
stalling for time,

311
00:17:47,804 --> 00:17:50,807
cover story, hemming, hawing,
excuse, alibi.

312
00:17:50,874 --> 00:17:53,076
Promotion?

313
00:18:00,617 --> 00:18:02,652
Don't shoot at the van.
Shoot at the driver.

314
00:18:06,056 --> 00:18:08,191
Not my driver.

315
00:18:08,258 --> 00:18:11,394
My partner Kodos will meet us
at the top of Mount Springfield.

316
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:13,196
- Partner?
- Writing partner.

317
00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:15,799
They told us, if you want
to make it in showbiz,

318
00:18:15,865 --> 00:18:17,901
you have to be on Earth.

319
00:18:21,938 --> 00:18:23,206
Sorry I'm late.

320
00:18:23,273 --> 00:18:25,342
By mistake,
I went to that other Earth

321
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:27,143
where the South
won the Civil War.

322
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,212
Far fewer Confederate monuments.

323
00:18:30,747 --> 00:18:32,716
Kang.

324
00:18:32,782 --> 00:18:34,784
I've been hit.

325
00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:40,457
One moment, my love.

326
00:18:43,493 --> 00:18:45,228
Nah! Nah! Missed me!

327
00:18:47,197 --> 00:18:48,898
Fear not, my sultry smokestack.

328
00:18:48,965 --> 00:18:50,433
I can heal you.

329
00:18:58,475 --> 00:19:00,610
Maybe you should cut down
a little, dear.

330
00:19:00,677 --> 00:19:02,379
For the baby.

331
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:04,314
- You mean...?
- That's right.

332
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:06,383
I'm pregnant.

333
00:19:07,484 --> 00:19:09,319
Selma, no!

334
00:19:09,386 --> 00:19:11,354
You two are too different.

335
00:19:11,421 --> 00:19:13,790
You're a Leo,
and he's a Sagittarius.

336
00:19:13,857 --> 00:19:15,558
I'm from Sagittarius.

337
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,895
Oh, don't go, Selma.

338
00:19:18,962 --> 00:19:22,365
Please.
I can't live without you.

339
00:19:27,337 --> 00:19:29,239
I have to warn you.
I'm gay.

340
00:19:29,305 --> 00:19:30,774
That's all right.

341
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,309
I have 32 sexual identities.

342
00:19:33,376 --> 00:19:35,311
I'm Klingon curious,

343
00:19:35,378 --> 00:19:37,213
always up
for some Wookiee nookie

344
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,115
or an R2 threesome,

345
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:41,551
not to mention
some Deep Space Nine,

346
00:19:41,618 --> 00:19:43,720
or possibly Jabba the Butt.

347
00:20:02,405 --> 00:20:04,974
Are you enjoying
the honeymoon planet?

348
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,310
Why didn't we come here
in the cool season?

349
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:08,845
This is the cool season.

350
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:11,314
Shall I get a sweater
for you, dear?

351
00:20:11,381 --> 00:20:13,216
It's 4,000 degrees.

352
00:20:13,283 --> 00:20:15,385
Nag, nag, nag.
