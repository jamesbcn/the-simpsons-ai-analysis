00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,490
You know, I could save money
by buying separate nuts...

344
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,310
...and mixing them at home.

345
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,690
Man, I wanted him to look good,
but not to show me up.

346
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,570
It's time to take out the thrash.

Woo-hoo! I rule this pseudo-sport.

Come back to me, boy.

354
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,640
Dad, you don't understand.

355
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,650
This was never about being cool,
it was about you not caring how I felt.

356
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,960
Oh, that's the dumbest thing
I ever heard, you stupid little kid.

357
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,410
Homer, you're heading
for parental face-plant.

Finally. Someone explains it to me
in words I can understand.

00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,020
Look, boy.
I know I did wrong and I'm truly sorry.

362
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,630
I put you in humiliating commercials
for money which I spent on myself.

363
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,130
I just wish I had an opportunity
to make things right.

364
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,600
Mr. Simpson, I like the way
you handled yourself on that board.

365
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,640
Would you like to do a commercial?

366
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,160
Anything. As long as I can give
the money to my son.

367

Excellent. I represent Viagrogaine,
the topical rub for bald, impotent men.

- Don't worry, Dad. It's a commercial.
