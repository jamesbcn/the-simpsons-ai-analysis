But I swear,
it was all because I never want

362
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:13,459
anything bad
to ever happen to you.

363
00:19:13,526 --> 00:19:14,929
I can handle bad.

364
00:19:14,995 --> 00:19:17,738
I can't handle losing
the one good parent I've got.

Why couldn't you just
let me invite Bart?

Oh, honey, but think
of how jealous and miserable

373
00:20:01,636 --> 00:20:02,839
he must be right now.

374
00:20:02,939 --> 00:20:05,915

I know Bart's a bad influence,

who wants to influence me.
