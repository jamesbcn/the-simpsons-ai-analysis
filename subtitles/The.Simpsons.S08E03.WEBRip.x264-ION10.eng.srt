I see. Do you have
a "receipt," sir?

No, I do not have
a receipt.

although I find their choice
of prize highly illogical

48
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,443
as the average Trekker

49
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,689

a medium-sized belt.

This isn't a belt.

63

89
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,338
squealing.

90
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,669
You've got to squeal
to every teacher

91
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,545
and every grown-up
you can find.

92
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,472
Coming to me
was a good start.

93
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,720
But then they'll just
beat me up even worse!

94
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:26,104
Yes. They are a clever bunch.

95
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,482
I know. I'll squeal for you--
to their parents.

103
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,449

-MOE: Fun's over, fellas.

my friend in my bar

106
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,328
there's a
two-drink minimum.

107
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,836
Geez, Homer,
I never seen

108
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,339
a guy stand up to that
kind of punishment.

109
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,472
I mean, you took
a three-man pounding

110
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,469
and didn't even fall down.

111
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,471
Big deal. I didn't even
get my kid's belt back.

112
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,144
The only thing a loser
like me is good for

113
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,523
is taking beatings.

114
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,769

That's the spirit!

115
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,442
Homer, I've seen
prizefighters

116

It's
the good life, Homer.

120
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,159
Some of these boxers

121
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,949
they eat steak and
lobster and salad bar

122
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,204
all in a single meal.

123
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,035

124
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,290
Their choice.

00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,292
You really think

126
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,174
Well, I don't know.

127
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,921
Are you man enough to test
every one of your limits?

128
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,513
-Yes.
-And are you man enough

129
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,089

should the opportunity arise?

130
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,094
-Yes!
-And are you

131
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,336

a 60% cut?

132
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,847

00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,599
MOE: Now Homer,

135
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,024
if I'm going to manage
your boxing career,

136
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,312
I want you to have
complete faith in me.

137
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,225
Here, let me show you something.

138
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,364
Wow, I've never
been in here before.

139
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,111
Yeah, well, when I realized

140
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,493
we hadn't had no ladies in here
since 1979

141
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,030
I turned it into an office.

142
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,327
You used to be a boxer
just like me?

143
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,290
Yep. They called me
"Kid Gorgeous."

144
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,621
Later on, it was
"Kid Presentable."

145
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,956
Then "Kid Gruesome,"

146
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,291
and finally, "Kid Moe."

147
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,746
Hey, what's this?

148
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,125
Aw, that's my old
spit bucket.

149
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,303
Yeah, I've been meaning
to empty that out.

150
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,803
(gasps)
You know Lucius Sweet?!

151
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,295
He's one of
the biggest names in boxing.

152
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,598
He's exactly as rich
and as famous

153
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,431
as Don King and he looks
just like him too.

154
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,058
Yeah, he was my manager.

155
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,864
Back when I was gorgeous,
everybody wanted a piece of me,

156
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,769
but somehow I just never made it
to the big time.

157
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,187
Why not?

158
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,185
'Cause I got knocked out
40 times in a row.

159
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,657
That plus politics.
You know, it's all politics.

160
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,238
Lousy Democrats.

161
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,203
(Marge growling)

162
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,583
Homer, of all
the crazy ideas you've had

163
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,541
this one ranks
somewhere in the middle.

164
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,872
You're 38 years old.

165
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,497
You don't know how to box

166
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,713
and you haven't gotten
any exercise since grade school.

167
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,665
Before you even consider this,
I insist you consult a doctor.

168
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,546
No <i>problemo.</i>

169
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,094
A competent doctor!

170
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,547
HOMER: D'oh!

171
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,927
Well, sir, you more than meet

172
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,394
every one of this state's
requirements

173
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,685
to box, wrestle
or be shot out of a cannon.

174
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,689
(growling)
That's what we get

175
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,321
for living in a state
founded by circus freaks.

176
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,189
You have an absolutely unique
genetic condition

177
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,317
known as
"Homer Simpson syndrome."

178
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,954
Oh, why me?!

179
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,450
Don't worry,
it's quite beneficial.

180
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,622
Your brain is cushioned
by a layer of fluid

181
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,581
one-eighth of an inch thicker
than normal.

182
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,411
It's almost as if you're wearing

183
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,996
a football helmet
inside your head.

184
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:40,671
Why, I could wallop you all day
with this surgical 2x4

185
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:44,511
without ever knocking you down,
but I have other appointments.

186
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,129
All right, Homer
let's see the left.

187
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,427
(grunts)

188
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,933
O-kay.

189
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,024
Let's see the right.

190
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,558
(panting)

191
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,641
Just a second.

192
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,726
When you're ready.

193
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,020
All right.

194
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,353
I'm ready.

195
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,438
Wait a minute.

196
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,612
All right.

197
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,400
Wait a minute.
Just a second.

198
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,445
Okay, punching isn't your thing,
but that's okay.

199
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,909
You're not that kind
of fighter.

200
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,409
What you're going to do
is stand there

201
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,331
while your opponent gets
exhausted from overpunching.

202
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,080
Then I can just push him over.

203
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,832
That's right, and if the ref's
not looking

204
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,754
you can kick him
a couple of times.

205
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,712
-Who's gonna knock you down?
-No one.

206
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,593
-When are you gonna fight back?
-Never!

207
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,590
-What are you gonna do?
-Nothing!

208
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,672
That's my boy!

209
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,471
Man, you'd never get me
into a ring.

210
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,854
Boxing causes brain damage.

211
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,645
Okay, you're fighting
a guy named Boxcar Bob.

212
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,228
Brawled his way up
from the boxcars, did he?

213
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,484
No, not yet.

214
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,435
He still lives
at the train yard

215
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,486
but he's a hungry
young fighter.

216
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,609
In fact, he's actually
fighting for a sandwich.

217
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:55,157
Homer, I want you to
have my lucky mitts.

218
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,913
I hope you do better
with them than I did.

219
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,115
Gee, thanks, Moe.

220
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,455
What's this?

221
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,710
Ah, that's the barbed wire.

222
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,041
We called that
"the stinger."

223
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,376
They don't let you
use that no more.

224
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,344
Now, no matter
how much he hits you,

225
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,053
you don't do
nothing, okay?

226
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,303
You don't want
to get drawn

227
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,795
into a boxing
match here.

228
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,888
(bell rings)

229
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,605
Way to go, Dad!
Take those punches!

230
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,742
Man, that tramp's
got the energy of a hobo.

231
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,449
Yeah, he never
stops punching

232
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,279
except to check
out his bindle.

233
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,790
Okay, Homer, he's tired.
He's tired.

234
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:49,006
Now's your chance.
Nudge him, nudge him.

235
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,258
(cheering)

236
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:00,346

237
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,357
<i>♪♪</i>

238
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,729
Hello, Moe.

239
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,983
Delightful to see you again.

240
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,737
Lucius! Hey, what's a glitterati
like you doing in my dump?

241
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,950
I thought you were managing
the champ.

242
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,203
Yes, managing Drederick
has been my highest priority

243
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,655
even though he is
temporarily incarcerated

244
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,826
for pushing his mother
down the stairs,

245
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,825
but with his
impending release

246
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,337
I've been strategizing
for his glorious return

247
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,879
to the shores of fistiana.

248
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,802
Uh... what?

249
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,551
His comeback fight.

250
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,093
You know-- boxing?

251
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,756
Oh, man. Yeah.

252
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,684
Well, who's donating his body
for that one, huh?

253
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,644
Well, word is you manage
a stalwart young pugilist

254
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,516
who cannot be knocked down.

255
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,853
Homer?

256
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,558
You want Homer to fight Tatum?

257
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,478
Well, the fans are weary
of fights that are over

258
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,187
before they have
an opportunity

259
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,317
to even get drunk.

260
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,565
I just need a body

261
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,486
who can sustain
verticality

262
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,914
for three rounds.

263
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,952
Yeah, but Homer's no boxer.

264
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,706
He's just a freak.

265
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,328
Tatum will fustigate him.

266
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,125
Well, fustigation aside, Moe,

267
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,788
you've got a choice.

268
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,956
You can either sit here
in the ladies' room

269
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,795
with your faded memories,

270
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,720
or you can take your last shot
at the big time

271
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,511
and I can make it happen.

272
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,854
(jingling)

273
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,429
Three rounds.
That's all I ask.

274
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,566
I got to be honest
with you, Homer.

275
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,741
I didn't bring you up here
to show you my new tar paper.

276
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,741
You didn't?

277
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,742
No. Homer,
how would you like

278
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,874
to be heavyweight champion
of the world?

279
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,451
-Oh, sure.
-Great.

280
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,996
All you got to do
is fight Drederick Tatum.

281
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,710
It's this Saturday.
Here's your parking pass.

282
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,880
Ooh. "General."

283
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,879
Who's Drederick Tatum,
anyway?

284
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,011
-Is he another hobo?
-Uh... you know what?

285
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,968
I'm gonna have to
check on that.

286
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,508
Well, I trust you, Moe.

287
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,972
If you say I can
beat this guy

288
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,851
then he doesn't
stand a chance.

289
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,934
(alarm wailing)

290
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,515
(shouting)

291
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,311
Hey, guys, come on.
Shut up.

292
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,774
(silence)

293
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,774
We didn't know
you were here.

294
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,356
-Sorry, champ.
-It was Jerry.

295
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,739
MAN 1:
Champ, champ.

296
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,493
Do you feel remorse
for your crime?

297
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,405
Oh, yes.
Believe me, my God,

298
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,464
if I could turn back the clock
on my mother's stair pushing,

299
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,328
I would certainly reconsider it.

300
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,415
MAN 2: Drederick, what do you think
of Homer Simpson?

301
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,462
I think he's a good man,
I like him.

302
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,254
I got nothing against him,

303
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,258
but I'm definitely gonna
make orphans of his children.

304
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,340
MAN 3: You know,
they do have a mother, champ.

305
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,135
Yes, but I would imagine
that she would die of grief.

306
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,510
(reporters shouting)

307
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,056
Thank you, thank you

308
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,679
but the champ has no time
for further queries.

309
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,637
This parole hearing
is over.

310
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,307
(reporters groaning)

311
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,855
{\an8}I wanted to know what it was
like in prison.

312
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,899
Homer,
why are they saying

313
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,695
you're going to fight
Drederick Tatum?

314
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,950
(gulps)

315
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,871
Uh... well...

316
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:50,581
I was gonna
surprise you, but...

317
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,123
happy anniversary, baby!

318
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,916
Have you lost your mind?!

319
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,539
Oh, come on!

320
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,586
I'll make a fortune
for one night's work.

321
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,340
We can have all the things
we always dreamed of--

322
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,172
a snooty butler,
carpeted carports,

323
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,718
those blue cupcakes
they sell sometimes--

324
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,972
But you'll get killed.

325
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,683
Marge, will you
let me finish?

326
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,223
Plug-in room
deodorizers,

327
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,476
front and rear spoilers
for the car.

328
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,939
Mom's right, Dad.

329
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,648
The odds against you winning
are a thousand to one.

330
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,149
I don't think
it's that unlikely.

331
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,151
Those are the odds
they're giving in Vegas.

332
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,613
All right

333
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,823
I think we've heard
just about enough

334
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,704
from Mr. Newspaper today.

335
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,334
MAN: <i>Society put</i>
<i>Drederick Tatum away</i>

336
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,250
<i>for his brutal crime,</i>

337
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,288
<i>but he's paid his debt,</i>

338
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,212
<i>and now he's going</i>
<i>to get revenge</i>

339
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,212
<i>on Homer Simpson.</i>

340
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,471
BOTH: Yay!

341
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,969
That's your daddy.

342
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,138
T-shirts. Get your T-shirts.

343
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:55,193
Tell them where you've been
by wearing a T-shirt.

344
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,899
BART:
You'll be okay, Dad.

345
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,609
Just make sure he hits you
an even number of times

346
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,190
so you don't end up
with amnesia.

347
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,698
Moe, I'm so glad
I found you.

348
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,333
Please, promise me
you won't let Homer get hurt.

349
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,411
Hey, I'm not the
villain here, okay?

350
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,956
If Homer gets killed
in the ring tonight,

351
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,540
it will be because of
your negative attitude.

352
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,455
-There, I said it.
-Listen to me!

353
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,344
The instant that Homer's
in any kind of danger,

354
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,881
I want you to
throw in this towel

355
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,344
and stop the fight!

356
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,014
All right, all right,
all right, I promise, okay?

357
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,143
Thank you.

358
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,236
Celebrities at ringside tonight:

359
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,992
star of the "McBain"
action films

360
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,414
and feature player in the
Hollywood prostitution scandal,

361
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,334
Rainier Wolfcastle!

362
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:59,422

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,250
Mr. Kent Brockman!

364
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,045
(crowd booing)

365
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,548
This just in:
Go to hell.

366
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,761
From the world
of organized crime,

367
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:12,932
say hello to
Anthony "Fat Tony" D'Amico!

368
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,523
And the ruiner
of events worldwide--

369
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,939
title fights, the Super Bowl
and the Nixon funeral--

370
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,689
ladies and gentlemen,
the Fan Man.

371
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,938
Ah, cripes.

372
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,986
Now I've got to comb
this side over.

373
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,575
All right, Homer,
I'm not gonna lie to you--

374
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,249
there's a good chance
you can beat Tatum

375
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,578
but you've got to visualize
how you're gonna win, okay?

376
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,865
Gotcha.

377
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,918
(crowd cheering)

378
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,552
A congenital heart defect
has apparently felled Tatum

379
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,590
moments before he could
step into the ring.

380
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,845
And now, please welcome back
into decent society,

381
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,258
ladies and gentlemen,

382
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:59,177
the heavyweight champion
of the world,

383
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,188
Drederick Tatum!

384
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,481

00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,882
of Tatum

393
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,668
we have the immovable object.

394
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,922
He's been called
"the brick hithouse"

395
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,835
and is also known as
"the southern dandy,"

396
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:34,854

400
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,062
Your boy looks
a little soft, Moe.

401
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,476
You do remember
our arrangement?

402
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,936
Yeah, don't worry.

403
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,566
You'll get your
three rounds.

404
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,152
Stupendous.

405
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,277
Because if he goes down
before that bell rings,

406
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,203
your future's going with him.

407
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,992
Okey-doke. Future
down the crapper. Gotcha.

408
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,697
Due to popular demand,

409
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,457
we will forgo
our national anthem.

410
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,499
And now, ladies and gentlemen

411
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,714
l-l-l-let's get ready
to rumb-l-l-le!

412
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,257
-(cheering)
-(bell dings)

413
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,772
Okay, Homer, nothing
to be worried about. Just--

414
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,733
(crowd gasps)

415
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,900
Wow! I've never seen Dad
hit somebody like that before.

416
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,939
What are you
talking about?

417
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,073
Isn't Dad the one
in the black trunks?

418
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,940
-No.
-Uh-oh.

419
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,897
What, what,
what am I missing? What?

420
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,697
ANNOUNCER: And there's Tatum
showboating for the crowd.

421
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,750
Geez, only six seconds in.

422
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,382
Attaboy, Homer.
Keep dancing.

423
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,799
ANNOUNCER: Showing utter disdain for
his opponent's abilities,

424
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,879
Tatum is taking a short,
midround breather

425
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,875
to converse with actor
Charlie Sheen.

426
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,257
You know what's great there
is the sea bass.

427
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,724
They do it blackened or sauteed.
It's stupendous.

428
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,465
Okay, break it up,
break it up, you two.

429
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,983
MARGE: Homer!

430
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,310
Homer, he's not going
to get tired.

431
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,266
You've got
to hit him back.

432
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,146
Hit him back!

433
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,943
HOMER:
<i>That cactus is right.</i>

434
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,197
<i>I've only got one chance.</i>

435
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,280
<i>I've got to knock him out.</i>

436
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:30,132
D-o-h-h-h-h!

437
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,880
Hang in there, Homer.

438
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,302
Only 440 more seconds.

439
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,380
He's getting
his second wind.

440
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,335
No. He's getting killed.

441
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,676
He's gonna die
on his feet.

442
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,891
I can't watch this.

443
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,681
I've got to get out of here.

444
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:45,892
Fight!

445
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,725
Somebody stop the fight!

446
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,574
Where's the doctor?!

447
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,319
{\an8}Kill him! Kill him!

448
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,701
ANNOUNCER:
It looks like it's all over.

449
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,569
Tatum wants to finish this
with one punch,

450
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,276
and here it comes.

451
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,237
(heart beating slowly)

452
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,165
ANNOUNCER: Oh, my God!

453
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,213
Simpson's manager

454
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,467
has flown into the ring
and is airlifting him out.

455
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,930
Ladies and gentlemen,

456
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,890
whatever dignity
remained in boxing

457
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,721
is literally flying out
the window.

458
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:26,927
Are you an angel?

459
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,767
Yes, Homer, I'm an angel.

460
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,852
All us angels
wear Farah slacks.

461
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,728
But you stopped the fight.

462
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,944
Won't everyone
be mad at you?

463
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,145
Let them be mad.

464
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,525
The only thing
that matters to me

465
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,742
is you're safe.

466
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:40,781
D'oh!

467
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,164
Sorry.

468
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,325
Homer, your manager

469
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,214
obviously loves
you very much.

470
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,421
Lucius, would you
do that for me?

471
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,883
Absolutely, I would.

472
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,263
Now get in the van.

473
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:02,549
You couldn't even give me
one lousy round, Moe.

474
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,386
You will always
be a loser.

475
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,771
Now take your check
for $100,000

476
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,638
and get out
of my sight.

477
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,935
I don't need
your stinking money.

478
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,395
Oh, Homie, are you okay?

479
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,822
I can't remember
where we parked.

480
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,402
That's all right.

481
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,857
We'll just wait till
everyone else leaves.

482
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,568
I got your tooth, Dad.

483
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,789
Uh, not mine.

484
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,250
Thank you, Moe.

485
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,830
I know you gave up
your dreams for Homer.

486
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,956
Well, what do dreams
matter, Marge?

487
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,844
I was able to stick up
for a pal.

488
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,802
Well, so long, Springfield.

489
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:41,842
Where are you going?

490
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,585
Nowheres in particular.

491
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,388
I just need some time to think.

492
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,232
Hey, there you are!

493
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,849
