{\an8}Just leave a little at the bottom,

00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,647
{\an8}so someone else has to
make the next pot.

So the soft fur, big eyes,
and gentle motion

130
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,608
are designed to make
it one hell of a pet,

131
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,359
with none of the poop.

132
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,441
This is the most adorable thing

133
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,856
I've ever seen in my entire life.

134
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,583
(clears throat)
What a wonderful science fair.

135
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,621
Unfortunately,
due to budget cuts,

136
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,615
we could not afford
our third place ribbon.

137
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,667
Now, in second place,
Lisa Simpson's grim description

138
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,461
of our shortsighted dependence
on fossil fuels.

139
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,506
It's about an asteroid.

140
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,550
They're all the same, Gloomhilda.

141
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,643
First place goes to Bart Simpson
and Martin Prince...

142
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,810
-Yeah!
-(kisses)

143
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,969
...for creating a furry robotic friend

144
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,387
who provides comfort
when humans fail to.

145
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,727
Which they will, trust me.

146
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:02,271
I carried you in my belly
for four and a half months.

147
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,686
When you fell out on the bus,
that's when my job ended.

148
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,655
(Ping-Pong ball bouncing)

149
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,739
Congratulations on
getting a ribbon, Lisa!

150
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,745
You must've baked
a mighty fine pie.

151
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,538
It wasn't a pie.

152
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,962
It was science!
And it's not fair.

153
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,211
My project was way better than Bart's,

154
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,053
and I didn't have help from a nerd!

155
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,878
-I'm my own nerd!
-Oh, sweetie.

156
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,344
Being second ain't the worst thing
that can happen.

157
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,925
Look at poor old Jasper over there.

158
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,681
(raspy sigh)

159
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:38,644
(sighs) He lost his wife,
his kids don't call.

160
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,516
Soon he'll just be bones and beard.

166
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,049
{\an8}Wow.

167
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,590
{\an8}While I was sitting here
feeling sorry for myself,

168
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,295
{\an8}Bart's invention actually
changed someone's life.

169
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,307
{\an8}And best of all, I got funding
for my Homer Humiliator.

170
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,771
Hmm!

171
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,730
Ooh! D'oh!

172
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,941
Why would a Homer Humiliator
do this to me?

00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,921
A free movie screening?
Of course I can go!

176
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,553
I just need somebody
to hold down the fort.

177
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,800
Hmm...

178
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,551
Hm! Oh, uh, Roz?

179
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,263
I have to step out
for one hour and 43 minutes.

180
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,144
-Could you cover for me?
-Go ahead.

181
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:00,601
(whoops) Oh, uh,
if an emergency alarm goes off,

182
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,233
there's earplugs
in the top drawer.

183
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,231
(horn honks)

184
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,494
(grunts)

185
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,160
Mm-mm.

186
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,833
(groans)

187
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,541
(laughing loudly)

188
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,582
Life imitates Flart.

189
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,835
-It says that on the poster.
-I thought of it first.

190
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,547
Marge, I just saw
the greatest movie!

191
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,181
Guess what happens when a mop
is replaced with an octopus.

192
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,679
I'll give you a clue.

193
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,051
It's funny!

194
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,597
Take off the 3-D glasses.

195
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,523
-(screams)
-Simpson-- a gangly little bird

196
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,272
told me you've been
lollygagging at the Biograph.

197
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,685
(stammering)
Someone snitched?

198
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,534
W-W-What are you
going to do to me?

199
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,149
-You're demoted.
-Up, or down?

200
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,106
-Down!
-(shrieks)

201
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,239
Don't tell my wife.

202
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,325
(children laughing)

203
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,082
So, partner,
what's next on the agenda?

204
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,834
Oh, um...

205
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,286
Back off, man!

206
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,626
Can't you see
you're embarrassing Bart?

207
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,511
When did you take that picture?

208
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,668
(chuckles)

209
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,966
Last time you slept over at my house.

210
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,760
I love when you're sleeping
and at peace.

211
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,814
(groans)

212
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,598
Hey, Skippy, we need some more
of them lovable critters

213
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,103
for our friends at the home.

214
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,104
(chuckles)
Unless you got any heroin.

215
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,596
You got any heroin?

216
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,689
Hmm?

217
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,864
Well, then, critters it is.

218
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,952
I'm telling you guys,

219
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,370
Roz told old man Burns
I ditched work early,

220
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,119
and now I'm her assistant.

221
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,491
I don't know, Homer.

222
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,747
You're saying she's nice on the outside,
but mean on the inside?

223
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,041
-No one could pull that off.
-Enjoy.

224
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,705
And as for you, Homer, don't worry.

225
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:54,383
You're at Moe's tavern--
lady-free since '83.

226
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,133
What the...
This is a gentleman's club!

227
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,216
Yeah! (belches)

228
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:02,641
So, what you boys drinkin'?
I'm buyin'.

229
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,472
Can we just have
the cash value of the drink?

230
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,807
-Be my guest.
-I'd rather use my money

231
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,892
to buy a Moe souvenir T-shirt.

232
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,557
That comes in kid sizes, too.

233
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,937
HOMER:
Oh, no, this is terrible.

234
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,944
What am I gonna do? Oh...

235
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,526
-Aren't you gonna come to bed, Homie?
-Can't, Marge.

236
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,662
I'm fighting for
my professional life here.

237
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,530
Do you know what I just learned?

238
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,866
My job is the reason
I get those checks every week.

239
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:30,043
And now that I'm demoted,
the checks have gotten smaller.

240
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,384
Not in physical size, but...

241
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,790
I know. I know.

242
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,958
♪♪

243
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,191
I represent the Eternal Valley
funeral home,

244
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,487
and I'm here to talk about
an extremely unpleasant subject--

245
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,282
people continuing to live.

246
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,655
If we don't have a frickin'
funeral soon, people,

247
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,833
you can say good-bye
to Howard's Flowers!

248
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,712
Calm down, Howard, Jr.

249
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,039
Now, here is the zip,
the zap, and the zing.

250
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,294
We're gonna rewire
Charlie Loveable here

251
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,876
into the greatest threat
to seniors' lives

252
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,262
since nursing homes themselves.

253
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,302
Switcheroo.

254
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,465
(growling)

255
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,940
Impressive.

256
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,190
Hard to believe two
ten-year-old kids built this.

257
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,863
And I heard one of them
did all the work.

258
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:38,942
-Wow.
-It's true.

259
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,949
(panting) Am I early?

260
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,495
You're late.

261
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,908
Since I got demoted,
I have to show my I.D.,

262
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,537
but the picture
was taken so long ago,

263
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,754
I put on a lot of weight,

264
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,884
so I have to stretch out
my face and say,

265
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,921
"I used to look like this."

266
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,174
Late.

267
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,509
You're mean.

268
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:06,472
Now, I want a list of 100 ways
to make your job worse

269
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,064
by close of business today.

270
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,558
-Can one of the 100 be making the list?
-No.

271
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,691
Can some of them be callbacks
to earlier ones?

272
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,848
-Also, no.
-(groans)

273
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,815
We're live at
the Springfield Retirement Castle,

274
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,689
where longtime resident,
Alice Glick, died last night,

275
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,237
at the paws of this
cuddly little killer.

276
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,281
Our Channel Six
substitute medical expert

277
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,775
Dr. Nick Riviera had this to say.

278
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,078
The champion was cleared to fight.

279
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:34,711
Ahem, Doctor, this press conference
is about a nursing home death.

280
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,330
The Springfield police are in the process

281
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,457
-of taking all the robots...
-(screaming)

282
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,843
<i>...into custody,</i>
<i>safely returning the seniors</i>

283
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,050
<i>-to their hopeless, dismal lives.</i>
<i>-(gunfire)</i>

284
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,221
Shut that thing off.

285
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,640
-(machine stops)
-I meant the TV!

286
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,679
-Sorry.
-(machine whirs)

287
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,177
(doorbell rings)

288
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:55,024
Hi. We need someone to reprogram
our robots to break out of jail.

289
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,772
(stutters excitedly)
A chance to reprogram robots?

290
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,515
Well, I had a date
with a beauty queen tonight,

291
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,108
but forget it.

292
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,782
(touch-tones beeping)

293
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,992
Uh, hello, yes, hello,
Miss Wyoming?

294
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,332
I'll have to climb
your Grand Tetons another night.

295
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,199
(laughs)
The breast joke!

296
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,116
I-I served it up.

297
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,544
Why won't he love me?!

298
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,044
(sobbing)

299
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:28,051
"Do this, do that."
Lousy Roz thinks she's so big.

300
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,175
Well, looks like it's time for another

301
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,142
"End of the Walk Talk
With Homer and Ned."

302
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,482
Tonight's topic--
the niceness of the evening.

303
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,138
-Hey.
-Homer, all nonsense aside,

304
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,727
are you oka-lidoka-laroony?

305
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:42,402
(sighs) I'm having problems
with my new boss Roz.

306
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,783
She's the most evil person
to come out of Ohio since LeBron.

307
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,571
But at least he thought
long and hard

308
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,655
before screwing everybody over,
in public, for no reason.

309
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:54,371
You know, I knew a backstabbing
Buckeye named Roz at Bible camp.

310
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,503
-Twice as tall as she should've been.
-(gasps) Is this her?

311
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,831
<i>Come on!</i>

312
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,336
<i>The apple must be</i>
<i>wreaking havoc with the Twinkie!</i>

313
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,958
(gasps) It is.

314
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,545
But if you've got the stones,

315
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,720
I can tell you
how to slay that "Gal-ioth."

316
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,339
Are you aware that "stones"
means man junk?

317
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,757
What the--
I've been using that around the boys.

318
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,926
(groans weakly)

319
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,770
Whew! Thank you.

320
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,691
Now, it was one of
our biggest celebrations,

321
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,401
<i>the 19th Sunday after Easter.</i>

322
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,992
<i>We'd just had a rousing no-fun run,</i>
<i>and in the heat of the moment,</i>

323
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,398
<i>I wanted to offer</i>
<i>my respectful best wishes.</i>

324
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,857
Peace be with you.

325
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,737
<i>Well, sir, she went crazy.</i>

326
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,825
<i>Crazier than</i>
<i>sleeping in on a Sunday.</i>

327
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,700
I can't stand to be touched!

328
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,907
Never tell anyone!

329
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,248
And I haven't. Not until now.

330
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,463
That's it! That's it!

331
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,214
My nightmare is over!

332
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,415
Oh, Flanders,
you are my personal savior.

333
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,337
Oh, that's nice,
but I don't approve of...

334
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,426
Hail Flanders!
Mightier than Jesus!

335
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,262
(groans)

336
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,305
Yes, I, uh,
I hereby call to order

337
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:03,363
this meeting of the North American
Man-Bot Love Association.

338
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,859
I'll say this one more time--
we really should change that name.

339
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,742
Yes, all right,
I'll change it to whatever you like,

340
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,699
as long as "Man-Bot Love"
is in there somewhere.

341
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,450
Now, let's look at
these blueprints, shall we?

342
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,793
(excited murmuring)

343
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,367
MARTIN: Wish I'd thought of that.

344
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,126
Uh, first, we remotely adjust them

345
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,208
so they will never be
malicious again.

346
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,504
There, there, and there.

347
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,757
Now, arise, little ones!

348
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,549
(snores, mutters)

349
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,554
Hey-Hey, what's going on here?

350
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,466
I better call 9-1-1.

351
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,426
(busy signal beeping)

352
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,185
Oh, it's always busy when I call.

353
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,398
(sighs)
What a bunch of idiots.

354
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,190
Hey-- Aw, I can't stay mad at you.

355
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,240
{\an8}Go on, get out of here.

356
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,532
{\an8}-Oh, oh, Chief?
-Yeah?

357
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,037
Yeah, you, too.

358
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,040
(chuckles)

359
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,291
Although this millennium
is still young,

360
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,133
I feel it is time to award
this giant trophy,

361
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,800
paid for with your health care cuts...

362
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,588
-(crowd groans)
-...to our beloved Roz.

363
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,216
(one person clapping slowly)

364
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,800
What the deuce?
Sarcastic clapping?

365
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:19,636
Congratulations, Roz.

366
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,603
What are you doing here, Simpson?

367
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,893
If there isn't dry cleaning
in the back of my car,

368
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,357
there's gonna be blood
on my knuckles.

369
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,438
Uh, I just came to say
that you're perfect.

370
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:33,445
So perfect, I think Mr. Burns
should give you a hug.

371
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,119
(gasps) Who told you?

372
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,738
I won't say,
but his initials are S.F.

373
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,446
Stupid Flanders!

374
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,286
(chanting)
Hug, hug, hug!

375
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,161
EMPLOYEES: Hug, hug, hug,

376
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,168
hug, hug, hug, hug.

377
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,883
(roaring)

378
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,462
(bones cracking)

379
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,466
You're fired.

380
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,636
I underestimated you.

381
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,179
I don't know what that
middle word means.

382
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,223
Well, it means my perception of you
is that you were kind of a goof,

383
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,177
but now I see you're rather clever.

384
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,598
-What is perception?
-It's how I view you.

385
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,937
-You understand that?
-No.

386
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,231
I used to think you were an idiot.

387
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,074
Now it turns out,
you're not such an idiot,

388
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,860
in fact, you might even be smart.

389
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,284
Little help?

390
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,784
(both grunting)

391
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,287
(muffled grunting)

392
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,495
Rub the butter around you.

393
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,126
(gulps)
Need more butter!

394
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,262
And not the unsalted.

395
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,049
Do you want to
get out of there or not?

396
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,557
<i>Mr. J., if I don't get my green card,</i>

397
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,730
<i>they're gonna turn me</i>
<i>back into a washing machine.</i>

398
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,900
No dawdling. Just move it along.

399
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,993
(sighs)

400
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,619
Oy, oy! My mechanical mensch!

401
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,039
How I missed you.
(grunts)

402
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,619
Bless you, boys.

403
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,544
Now that we got 'em back,
we'll never let 'em go again.

404
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,495
'Cause there's no stronger force

405
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:15,125
than a senior citizen
holding onto a freebie.
