1
00:00:13,444 --> 00:00:14,415
D'oh!

2
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,418
Y'ello.

3
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,387
Dad, I'm sleeping over
at Milhouse's

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,954
and I can't take it.

5
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:23,424
Come on, Bart,
read me to sleep.

6
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:26,127
And do the voices.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,996
I'm ruler,
said Yertle.

8
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,731
Of all that I see.

9
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,366
Could we try that again?

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,202
And hit I'm a little harder.

11
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:36,937
I'm ruler,
said Yertle.

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,006
Faster and this time
hit said.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,808
That makes no sense.

14
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:43,177
Okay, we'll do it your way,
then my way,

15
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:46,314
and I'll see what works
in editing.

16
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:48,849
Dad, get me outta here.

17
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,651
Sorry, boy,
you know the rule.

18
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:53,887
Accept the invite,
stay the night.

19
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,026
Hello, Yertle.

20
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,329
Oh, my God.

21
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:03,097
I'll be on the next plane.

22
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:05,799
What's wrong, honey?

23
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,035
My Aunt Eunice is dying.

24
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,903
I have to leave right away.

25
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,905
Oh, poor Marge.

26
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,974
Wait.
She said I, not we.

27
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,376
I don't have to go.

28
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:23,517
Aw, you love her too.

29
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,992
Sweetie,
do you want to come?

30
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:34,995
With all my heart.

31
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,198
But the children need me.

32
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,543
Y'ello.

33
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:51,779
Dad, I am begging you.

34
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,046
Who is this?

35
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,482
Okay.

36
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,550
I made a loaf
of peanut butter and jelly.

37
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:59,320
You just have to slice it
into sandwiches every day.

38
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:01,088
- Check.
- I set the Roomba up

39
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,456
to cope with your cleaning.

40
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:09,997
- Check.
- I made a welcome wagon basket

41
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,065
for our new neighbors
from Eastern Europe.

42
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,967
- Check.
- Not Czech, Slovenian.

43
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,569
Check.

44
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:19,573
One last thing,
this is very important, Homer.

45
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:23,177
The new season of Odder Stuff
drops on Netflix tonight.

46
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:24,778
Something to do.

47
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,215
Do not watch it without me.

48
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:31,219
What? Why not? I have to see if
my fan theories are correct.

49
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:34,121
I think it's set in the '80s.

50
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,989
Homer, the nine hours

51
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,793
we binge watch that show
together is our thing.

52
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,995
And we don't have
a lot of things.

53
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,832
But holding hands
in a darkened room

54
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,800
with my head
on your shoulder

55
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:50,804
has become the glue
that seals our love.

56
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,773
I get it.
I totally get it.

57
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:54,007
I know I'm not perfect.

58
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,277
Sometimes I forget
our marriage birthday.

59
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,178
- Our anniversary?
- Yes.

60
00:02:58,212 --> 00:03:00,648
And sometimes I forget
your birth anniversary,

61
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,751
but I promise I will not watch
our show without you.

62
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,653
Thank you, Homie.

63
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,988
Thank you girls for coming.

64
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,359
Dearest, you were always
our favorite aunt.

65
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,160
Psst, over here.

66
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,195
When she's gone,
I get the P's,

67
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,730
Selma gets the S's.

68
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:19,166
You get to notify the utilities.

69
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,469
Can't this wait until
after she's dead?

70
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,103
I'll be too busy grieving.

71
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:27,341
Yeah. Too busy grieving
I got the salt shaker.

72
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:31,078
Easy-peasy.
P for salt, S for pepper.

73
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,347
I'm walking towards a light...

74
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,985
with a Post-it on it.

75
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,188
Okay, sweetie, here's a book

76
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,157
that can help you fall asleep.

77
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,494
No, no, no. No, sweetie.

78
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,896
You chew it, like this. Look.

79
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,266
Yummy book.

80
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:57,671
Hey.

81
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,143
Hey, what?

82
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:08,316
What's this?
What are you doing?!

83
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:09,950
You guys can't watch this.

84
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,353
No...
You can't watch this.

85
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,588
We didn't promise Mom nothing.

86
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:19,593
Children, there are 400 shows
you could watch right now.

87
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:21,429
Many with Ted Danson.

88
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,202
Wait for me.

89
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,173
This show you can watch.

90
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,375
Too depressing.

91
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,948
No.

92
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:44,151
Must find place to avoid
pop culture discussions.

93
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,253
I know. The watercooler.

94
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,923
- The Semi-Gorgon...
- So many twists...

95
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,392
- I know.
- Set in the '80s.

96
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,093
And the Guffer Brothers.

97
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,062
My turn to talk about
how much I liked it.

98
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,397
Shouldn't doing something nice
for your wife

99
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,965
feel better than this?

100
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,634
Homer, will you read my
Odder Stuff fan fiction?

101
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,403
I threw it over
Stephen King's fence

102
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,071
but it hit him
on the head.

103
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,439
Why Stephen King?

104
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:07,140
He's got a low fence.

105
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,613
Don't worry, kids.

106
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,615
Sideshow Mel will be fine.

107
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,450
He has an air bubble.

108
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:19,119
It's all carbon dioxide now!

109
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:23,290
This is the last time

110
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,826
I buy a trick
from a magician's widow.

111
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,834
Nobody's watching my show.

112
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:36,136
What with the downloading
and the streaming,

113
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,071
and the fact that
everything else is better.

114
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:39,807
Now, you're my writers!

115
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,174
You pay us like interns.

116
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,810
And I'm your niece.

117
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,244
- Hey-hey.
- Hey-hey.

118
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,113
Now I want ideas.

119
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,648
Why don't we do another
live special?

120
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,650
What?
I can't remember lines.

121
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,452
At my last wedding
I wrote I do

122
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,186
on the rabbi's forehead.

123
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,189
You could hide a golden ticket
in some candy like Willy Wonka.

124
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,826
The only children allowed
in my factory

125
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,661
are the ones that work there.

126
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,329
How 'bout we have a contest?

127
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,865
Some lucky kid gets to run
around a Krusty store

128
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,167
for five whole minutes
and take all the toys they want.

129
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,970
It inspires buying,
it's easy to promote,

130
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,139
and it's the third thing
someone pitched.

131
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,574
I'm sold!

132
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,086
Let's see what else
Netflix has to offer.

133
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:30,057
Because you watched an '80s
show featuring a monster...

134
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,561
Alf, Roseanne, Moonlighting,
The Cosby Show...

135
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,162
They're all too scary.

136
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,534
God forgive me.

137
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,173
No. Only when we're together.

138
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,575
It's our glue.

139
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,142
Homer, I'm Ted Sarandos.

140
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,744
Chief Content Officer
of Netflix.

141
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:55,282
This can't be a dream because
I don't know who you are.

142
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,885
I'm not a dream. Let's just say
I'm a manifestation

143
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,253
of complex algorithms that know
everything about you.

144
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,990
Well, I can't watch this
because...

145
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,192
I know. I know.
Marge told you not to.

146
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,727
Do you know that
she's been watching

147
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,097
Scandinavian crime dramas
with full nudity without you?

148
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,065
That nudity is story-driven.

149
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,067
Yeah, right.

150
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,203
But Odder Stuff is our thing.

151
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,705
No. Your thing's with us.

152
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:18,972
She's just along for the ride.

153
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,874
The account's in your name.

154
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:23,043
Come on, come on,
watch it now.

155
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:25,112
Because our subscription prices
will triple tomorrow.

156
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,137
Wow. I finally finished
something

157
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,039
I wasn't supposed to start.

158
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:53,574
That is impressive.

159
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,242
I won't even mind watching it
again with...

160
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,277
Homer?!

161
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,045
The lady from my marriage.

162
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,649
My aunt recovered.

163
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:03,684
Why are you up at 5:00 a.m.?

164
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,486
Still warm.

165
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:10,524
You watched it.

166
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:15,028
I finally learn
how little I mean to you.

167
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:17,030
Wait.

168
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:20,167
No.

169
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,081
Marge, I am sorry.

170
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,850
Come on,
it's a stupid TV show.

171
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:40,187
I don't want to hear your voice.

172
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,393
No. We're staying married.

173
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,331
Enough with the rebuses.

174
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,868
All right, I'll just grab my
pillow and sleep on the couch.

175
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:58,338
No. You'll sleep
right next to me.

176
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,175
Because I want you to feel
the bitter rays

177
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,346
of ice coming
from my frozen soul.

178
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,024
It's so bitterly cold.

179
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:23,864
I'm fine.

180
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,399
To enter our contest,

181
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,201
write down, in 15 words or less,

182
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:31,371
why you love me
more than God and America.

183
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,007
The top three essayists
will earn a chance

184
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,076
to run roughshod through
a Krusty store

185
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:40,213
and not get tased by security.

186
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:43,516
Whoever fills the cart
with the most toys

187
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,518
gets to keep them free.

188
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:49,757
And the other two get the worst
kind of squat, diddly.

189
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,426
Diddly? You can't say
that word on TV.

190
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,196
Employees and monkeys of this
network are not eligible.

191
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,634
Lis, will you write
my essay for me?

192
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:02,602
What, you can't even
come up with,

193
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:05,038
I love Krusty because
I'm a class clown

194
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,240
and he's a clown with class?

195
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:10,210
Perfect. And the best thing is
I'm stealing it from you.

196
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,079
Oh, that'll impress 'em.

197
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,748
Go ahead. But there's one thing
I want you to hear.

198
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:18,618
When you win by cheating,
eventually you lose.

199
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:19,987
Wait, sorry,
after you said win,

200
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,722
I started thinking
about dirt bikes.

201
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,802
You cheated on your wife,
Homer.

202
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,971
I waited for Lenny
before I watched.

203
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,308
After this,
we've got a stand-up special

204
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,743
from Chris Rock.

205
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,244
Don't watch that
with your wife either.

206
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,354
Quit sleeping in the garden!

207
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,097
Dad?

208
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,834
Sweetie, everything's fine.

209
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:10,403
Dad, maybe you should be talking
to someone who's older than me.

210
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:11,805
Ted Sarandos?

211
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,173
Who's Ted Sarandos?

212
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,108
I was hoping you knew.

213
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,677
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

214
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,013
My son, what are your sins?

215
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:22,716
Aside from thinking
our church has confession.

216
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,019
I watched a binge-worthy TV show
without my wife.

217
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:28,688
Was it The Crown?
Don't tell me how it ends.

218
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:30,523
Doesn't she become queen?

219
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,059
Oh, go to hell.

220
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:33,861
What am I gonna do?

221
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,662
I don't know what she wants!

222
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,630
Homer, sorry
to blow my own horn...

223
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,301
but Netflix knows your wife
better than you do.

224
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,203
Do you know what
she watches incessantly

225
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,671
when you're not around?

226
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,073
Usually this thing.

227
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,877
Dance shows! She loves 'em!

228
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,813
Want to win her back?
Learn to dance, my puppet.

229
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:57,450
I have disappointed Marge
with my dancing in the past.

230
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,192
I'll do it!

231
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,806
Did you guys
all let down your wives?

232
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,373
I'm not that pathetic.

233
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,911
I'm just paying $40 an hour
for basic human contact.

234
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,079
Cha-cha-cha!

235
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,718
Hello. My name is Julia.

236
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,753
Just remember
Julia believes in you.

237
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,889
Julia will always
believe in you.

238
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,926
Julia will stay with you
until you are a dancer.

239
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,360
- What's my name?
- Homer.

240
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,529
- No. My name.
- Julia.

241
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:43,931
And why are you here?

242
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:47,201
I need to learn how to dance
to get my wife back.

243
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:51,371
It's been a long time
since a woman said that to me.

244
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,080
Now we begin.

245
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:09,156
Zoey B, Zoey T,
you work with these guys.

246
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,025
This man needs one-on-one help.

247
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,994
I don't know how
to tell you this,

248
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:16,029
but you are a terrible dancer.

249
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:18,798
It seems like you did know
how to tell me that.

250
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:21,268
But I am taking you on
as my personal challenge,

251
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,838
and when I take on a challenge,
I don't quit!

252
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,244
Okay, here's the first thing.

253
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,214
When you step on my toe,
it causes me pain.

254
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,017
I'm learning so much.

255
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:47,995
How's your toe?

256
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,562
Doesn't matter.

257
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,698
I don't quit and neither do you.

258
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:04,144
Homer, you're getting there.

259
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,546
You're aware of when
the music is playing.

260
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,449
Can't dance.

261
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:11,151
Marriage over.

262
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,753
Will live on boat.

263
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:17,057
I'm gonna have to do
something I didn't want to do.

264
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,092
I'm bringing in my partner.

265
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:20,493
Sweet Sal!

266
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,497
Watch me. With one hand,
you can lead a woman.

267
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:29,102
- I find that hard to...
- You have to come forward when I do this.

268
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:30,904
You have to go back
when I do this.

269
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:32,705
As I push my palm
into your back,

270
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:35,909
- you're forced to turn here.
- I am. I am.

271
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:40,847
Back straight! Knees bent!

272
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,116
Feet arched! Eyes merry!

273
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:59,266
Moe's Tavern.
Moe speaking.

274
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,368
Homer? Nah, sorry, Midge.

275
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,136
I ain't seen him in weeks.

276
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,704
What do you mean?

277
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,140
He told me he's been there
every night.

278
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:08,575
Oh, Homer Simpson.

279
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,177
Oh, no, I thought
you were talking about,

280
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,379
Homer the blind poet
who wrote the Iliad

281
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,214
and the Odyssey there, yeah.

282
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,684
'Cause he ain't been around
since, like, 720 BC.

283
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,402
Another night at Moe's?

284
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,004
Yeah. I'm beat.

285
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:38,571
The couch.

286
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,348
Quiet!

287
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:53,386
Okay, Homer, time to do a lift.

288
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,288
Are you sure?
I'm pretty heavy.

289
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:58,291
No, me. Just grab my waist
and hold on tight.

290
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,060
I'm doing all the work.

291
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,231
We'll work on that.

292
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:05,598
Hey, hey!

293
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,501
It's time
for Krusty's Toy Trample!

294
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:10,603
We have three finalists.

295
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,406
But only the first finisher
gets to keep his toys.

296
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,942
Losers have to pay
the winner's income tax.

297
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:20,013
We rehearsed this with monkeys,
and everything went great!

298
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,087
Now, to take out these
two losers in two seconds.

299
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,090
Dead Grandma, is that you?

300
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:31,491
On your marks,

301
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,260
prepare to advance.

302
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,495
Commence!

303
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,309
- No!
- No!

304
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,099
Congratulations, kid!

305
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:15,068
And you also won
a day with Krusty!

306
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:17,070
Day with Krusty
will actually be

307
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:18,505
day with Sideshow Mel.

308
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,173
Don't we get anything?

309
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:22,709
Of course.
You two get the greatest prize

310
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,711
any kid could ask for...

311
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,147
Wooden paddles
with balls on 'em.

312
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,182
Mine's broken already.

313
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,717
Use your imagination.

314
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,020
The ball is a rocket ship,
and the paddle is a...

315
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,989
I don't know. Why am I wasting
my time with this kid?

316
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,392
- Is he dying?
- Not that I know of.

317
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,694
Well, then get him
outta here!

318
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:44,164
Marge, it's me.

319
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:45,732
I want to ask you one favor,

320
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,100
and I won't bother you again.

321
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:48,235
There's a dress in the bedroom.

322
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,470
Put it on and meet me
at 15th and Elm.

323
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,004
Are you going to tell me

324
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,673
where you've been spending
your nights?

325
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,308
All will be made clear.

326
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,245
Marge, go to him.

327
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:00,480
If you don't,
he'll head off to the war,

328
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,249
and you'll never
see him again.

329
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,417
He's not going to war.

330
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,919
That coward!
He doesn't deserve my daughter!

331
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,292
She's here.

332
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,103
You look beautiful.

333
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,938
Cut it out.

334
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,574
Why are we here?

335
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,042
To dance.

336
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,278
I don't know how.

337
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:35,014
Marge, all you have to do is
one incredibly difficult thing.

338
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,016
Trust me.

339
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,351
<i>I'm here</i>

340
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:44,591
<i>Let's dance</i>

341
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,195
<i>My dear</i>

342
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:49,529
Yeah.

343
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:54,133
<i>What's your name?</i>

344
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:58,538
<i>How do you do?</i>

345
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:03,009
<i>What's the game?</i>

346
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:08,948
<i>Hallelujah</i>

347
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,817
<i>I saw a girl</i>

348
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,654
I've never seen this.

349
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,724
Mom and Dad
romantically in love.

350
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:21,093
It's like rebirth.

351
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:24,096
It cures all the wounds.

352
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,435
Bart, are you seeing this?

353
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:31,170
I set a new record, 89.

354
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:34,774
Wha... You missed the greatest
moment in our parents' lives.

355
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,609
89's pretty good.

356
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:38,945
<i>How</i>

357
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,781
<i>Do you do?</i>

358
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:45,918
I have not felt this good
since I signed Shonda Rhimes.

359
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,954
<i>You're there</i>

360
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:49,989
<i>I'm here</i>

361
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,326
Okay, Homer, catch and lift.

362
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,597
<i>But let's dance</i>

363
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,734
<i>My dear</i>

364
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:07,640
<i>What's your name?</i>

365
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:12,245
<i>How do you do?</i>

366
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:15,181
<i>What's the game?</i>

367
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,187
Hey!

368
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,855
Wait, how did you get a toy?

369
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,658
It was a thank-you from Ralph
for writing his essay.

370
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,327
You wrote Ralph's essay too?

371
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,829
It's called
hedging your bets, boys.

372
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:32,399
Hi-yo, just desserts!

373
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,201
Did someone say just desserts?

374
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,737
Dad, it's just an expression.

375
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,872
Just an expression, eh?

376
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,174
I have to warn you,
we just have desserts.
