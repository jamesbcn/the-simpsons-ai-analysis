{\an8}Uh, Chief, it says here

30
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,710
{\an8}you need to take
a 40-hour training course

31
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,792
{\an8}and get certified
before you can legally...

And remember,
God is listening to your prayers.

-Boom.

00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,504
Don't worry, Reverend,
according to your policy,

91
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,173
your church is covered
for everything but acts of God.

92
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:18,594
But we believe everything that happens
everywhere is an act of God.

93
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,715
By jiminy, you're right!

94
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,892

ALL:
Saluki Strut!

99
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,737
So we have no money
to repair the church.

100
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,661
And developers are itching
to build on our land.

101
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,910
Fast-casual dining downstairs,

102
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,543
live-work lofts upstairs,

103
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,579
and as an anchor store--

104
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,583
a chain pharmacy.

105
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,665

106
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,089

107
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,418
This building
is the heart of our community.

108
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,675
We have our weddings here,
our funerals.

109
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,338
Our fun runs begin and end here.

110
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,258
I will not rest until it is rebuilt.

111
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,637
I can't believe it,

112
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:11,024
but the church is going to have
to ask people for money.

113
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,605

114
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,400
Who keeps putting
pickle slices in here?

115
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,574
I think I can help you
get the money that you need.

116
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,414
But you don't go to our church.

117
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,619
Granted,
I do not share your faith,

118
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,620
but the yahoos in this town
need a church

119
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,253
to deliver weekly reminders
not to steal-- from me.

120
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,752
And not to take a life--
my life.

121
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,594
Yar, without organized religion,

122
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,209
I've lost me moral compass.

123
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,086
Also I've, uh,
I've been addicted to Oxy

124
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,844

125
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,676
Yar.

126
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,062
Now,
this is what I have got in mind.

127
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,479
I will whisper even though we are alone.

128
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:53,268
All right, people,
Marge has brought this heathen

129

130
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,772
Please do not call me a heathen.

131
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,607
It offends Hanuman,
the monkey-headed lord of winds,

132
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,613
who believed
the sun to be a ripe mango...

133
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,616
Okay, I get it. I get why you say it.

134
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,988
Apu thinks we can get the money

135
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,696

136
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,697

137
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,118
The casino?!

138
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,036
Blackjack's for suckers.

139
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,334
My brother?

140
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,047
He used to own three Arby's franchises.

141
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,048
Lost 'em all at the tables

142
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,050
and gave himself
a shotgun tonsillectomy.

143
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,433
But you told me Uncle Stevie
moved to Okinawa.

144
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,642
What I told you was to wait in the car.

145
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,643
No, no, you can beat the house.

146
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,055
By counting cards.

147
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,653
I myself have done it--

148
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,688
when I was a student at MIT,

149
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:41,322
<i>the Mumbai Institute of Tantric Sex,</i>

150
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,821
<i>where I was recruited</i>
<i>by a card-counting ring.</i>

151
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,323
<i>I won enough money</i>
<i>to buy fake SAT scores</i>

152
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,566
<i>I used to get into the real MIT,</i>

153
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,288
<i>where I failed every class</i>
<i>and was kicked out</i>

154
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,079
<i>and had to move to Springfield.</i>

155
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,042
-Mm-hmm.
-Mmm.

156
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,332
Am I hearing this right?

157
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,455
Is the church council
truly considering gambling?

158
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,003
You know, Ned,

159
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,956
the Bible never explicitly
condemns gambling.

160
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:06,427
Biblical folks were always
playing games of chance,

161
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,849
like, uh, drawing lots.

162
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,848
(gasps)

163
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,059
Leviticus drew lots.

164
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,679
Joshua drew lots, Nehemiah.

165
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,765
Even the apostles were lot-drawers.

166
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,691
(gasps)
If gambling's okay,

167
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,269
then I'm getting health insurance
for the kids.

168
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,815
Card counting is not gambling.
It is math.

169
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,649
And it's not even against the rules.

170
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,494
Exactly.

171
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,570
If you are caught,
you cannot be charged with any crime.

172
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,076
The worst they will do
is beat you with a phone book

173
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,489
or break some fingers.

174
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:36,747
But what is a little pain
if your church is to be saved?

175
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,081
It is all good.

176
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,168
Counting cards requires
absolute focus.

177
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,087
You must ignore
all casino distractions.

178
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,137
(slot machines ringing over stereo)

179
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,850
(all coughing)

180
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,731
And beware of cocktail waitresses

181
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,268
with free drinks
and eyeball-height cleavage.

182
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:01,522
They're not attractive,
but you cannot look away.

183
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,686
<i>FEMALE VOICE (over stereo):</i>
<i>Freshen your drink, hon?</i>

184
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,113
<i>Who had the Scotch and soda?</i>

185
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,032
<i>Cocktails. Cocktails.</i>

186
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,110
<i>-Another one, hon?</i>
-You, what is the count?!

187
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,026
(stammers)

188
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,275
Get your head in the game, Mel!

189
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,787
Now remember, for this
legal-but-frowned-upon scheme to work,

190
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,791
we must have complete secrecy.

191
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,503
Do not tell anyone
what you are doing.

192
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,794
Not even Homer?

193
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,747
(sighs)
Homer is many things,

194
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,837
but not a good accomplice.

195
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,133
If he gets involved
and this scheme fails,

196
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,217
what happens to our church?

197
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,222
(dance music plays)

198
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,805
(all groan)

199
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,023
Oh, even I saw that.

200
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,983
I guess I can't tell Homer.

201
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,938
I'm leaving
for my fund-raising meeting.

202
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,356
Don't wait up.

203
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,994
Why are you church-os
getting together so late?

204
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,082
I'm asking because I'm supposed
to care about things.

205
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:57,078
Well, to raise money, we're...

206
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,831
putting on a revue.

207
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,833
Well, you can't go wrong
with a revue.

208
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,245
Skits and songs?

209
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,463
(chuckles)

210
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,293
I'm entertained already.

211
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,918
Yeah, so, uh...

212
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,724
I'm going out to rehearse...
the revue.

213
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,719
Go. Go make magic.

214
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,141
You just go.
(chuckles)

215
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,510
Revue.

216
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,610
<i>APU:</i>
<i>Card counting is simple.</i>

217
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,032
<i>We all sit at different tables,</i>
<i>betting low,</i>

218
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,651
<i>playing hand after hand,</i>

219
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,277
<i>counting in your head</i>
<i>how many high cards</i>

220
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,195

221
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,945
<i>Ignore all distractions.</i>

222
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,576
(stammering)

223
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,879
<i>When the count is high,</i>
<i>you have a "hot deck,"</i>

224
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,672
<i>and the odds are in your favor.</i>

225
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,715
<i>Then you use a secret signal</i>
<i>to call in "the Closer."</i>

226
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,391
<i>The Closer bets big, wins bigger,</i>

227
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,970
<i>and the casino never suspects</i>
<i>that it has been the victim</i>

228
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,977
<i>of a morally acceptable screw job.</i>

229
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,230

230
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,534

231
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,029

232
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,422
LOVEJOY:
What a haul.

233
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,498
MARGE:
Ooh.

234
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,916
One more night like this,

235
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,424
and we'll be able
to fix the church in style.

236
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,085
What a rush--
it got my blood pumping

237
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,717
in a way I thought
only quiet reflection could.

238
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,314
Fizzy water for everyone.

239
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:44,309
I think we can do something
a little harder than that.

240
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,809
Mmm!

241
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:52,227
Now, that's a marshmallow-y
s'more-garita.

242
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,659
Homer, Homer, we did it.

243
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,819
(mumbling)
Wh-What'd you do?

244
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,828
We're going to save the church.

245
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,410
I feel like celebrating.

246
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,832
B-But... But it's not on the calendar.

247
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,456
Okay, but if I'm sleepy
at work tomorrow,

248
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,503
I get to tell everyone why.

249
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,922
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

250
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,296
1:00 a.m. loving
and 2:00 a.m. steak?

(sighs)

253
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,385
I guess nothing
gets the heart pumping

254
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,603
like a church revue.

255
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,943
Huh?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, the revue.

256
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,729
Oh, I got so many questions.

257
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,273
What are the skits about?

258
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,226
Uh, pop culture and current events.

259
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,437
How do you transition
between scenes?

260
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,658
Hard blackouts or spotlight fades?

261
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,908
-Uh, both.
-Nice.

262
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,870
You know,
it wouldn't be a revue without songs.

263
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,291
Tell me about one.

264
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,869
Okay,
uh, there's a song about, um...

265
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,876
how Democrats and Republicans
can't get along.

266
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,800
It's called, "Cats and Dogs."

267
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,892
(laughing)
Oh.

268
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,220
You got yourself
one hell of a show, Marge.

269
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,725
One hell of a show.

270
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,305

271
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,555
Okay, okay, don't get cocky,

272
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,687
you rapture-waiting baby-baptizers.

273
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,994
You had one good night,
but now the casino is on to you.

274
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,399
They're not going to let you

275
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,617
anywhere near those blackjack tables,

276
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,199
unless you wear these.

277

MARGE:
Disguises?

278
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,245
I'm worried our scam
is becoming dishonest.

279
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,249
Relax, Marge.

280
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,671
If God lets the Jews
have Sunday on a Saturday,

281
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,091
he'll be cool with this.

282
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,089
Why, I bet the Lord
is pleased as punch

283
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,711
that we're using
that dirty casino money

284
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,337
to rebuild his temple.

285
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,344
Our mission is 100% pure.

00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,725
I could be Sideshow...

289
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,059
I'm telling Mom
about how the school freezer broke

290
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,765
and they had to cook all the Tater Tots

291
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,895
and the teachers took the extra Tots home
in manila envelopes.

292
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:55,902
I'm telling her!

293
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,783
You never let me tell.

294
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,200
Mom, the freezer broke and...

295
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,568
-Cooked all the Tater Tots,
-Cooked all the Tater Tots.

00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:01,574
-and there were too many Tots,
-Too many Tots.

297

-Manila envelopes.

Okay, Mel.

301
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,658
I'll be at the casino by 10:00.

302
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,745
Meet me at the lounge
by the J. Geils cover band.

303
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,381
Mom,
why are you going to a casino?

304
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,050
Are you... a hostess?

305
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:21,049
Actually, my friends and I
are using a system

306
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,473
to win money to save the church.

307
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,012
I can't believe you're gambling.

308
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,636
It's not gambling.

309
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,853
It's math.

310
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,483
Is Dad in on this takedown?

311
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,479
It's not a takedown.

312
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,861
And I haven't told him about it.
Yet.

313
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,269
But it's okay
for you guys to know

314
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,278
because you're finally
grown-up enough

315

Yeah, we are grown-up.

317
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,076
I know how much
to tip a waiter.

318
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,488
I go on hikes with my friends

319
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,946

about our problems.

320
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,746
I'll tell your dad everything

when we have the money.

322
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,376
But until then, I appreciate

323
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:58,048
you keeping

00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,310
Well, I was taking a moment

353
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,443
to enjoy my after-dinner night cap...

354
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,727
Dad, Mom trusted us with a secret.

355
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,146
But she hasn't come home yet,

356
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,954
and we're worried she's in trouble.

357
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,358
(burping)
What?!

358
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,986
BOTH:
Mom's counting cards at the casino!

359
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,994
Oh, if anything happens to Marge,

360
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,116
(gasps)
we'll all be orphans!

361
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,373
(gasping)

362
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,334
I'm coming for you, baby.

363
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,464
Have you seen this woman?

364
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,460
Have you?

365
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,791
Have you seen my wife?

366
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,879
This is your wife?

367
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,302
Do you know where she is?

368
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,130
Uh, we'd like to ask you
some questions

369
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,546
in our "beating room."

370
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:12,434
All right,
as long as it's just questions.

371
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,063
Reverend! Reverend!

372
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,059
They took Homer!

373
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,061
Why are you still dressed like that?

374
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,483
Um, well...
(chuckles nervously)

375
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,192
HELEN:
Oh, Asphodel...

376
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,863
Your corpse bride is getting cold.

377
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,903
Uh, one second, Belladonna.

378
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,527
Helen and I have found that, uh,

379
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,453
these new personas
have been quite liberating.

380
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,453
Was that a woman's voice?

381
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,075
Send her in.

382
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,751
(retches)

383
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,620
If we don't give back
the money we won counting cards,

384
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,248
the casino people
are going to hurt Homer.

385
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,665
Okay, uh...

386
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,303
Tiny snafu.

387
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,300
I've already given the money
to the contractor.

388
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,303
Then we'll just have
to ask that contractor

389
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,675
to give the money back.

390
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,351
(laughs)

391
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,760
Give the money back?

392
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,768
(laughs)

393
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,770
Hey, Jerry, th-they want
the money back.

394
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,733
<i>La dama azul quiere</i>
<i>devolver el dinero.</i>

395
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,824
(all laughing)

396
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,240
Are you gonna put my head in a vice?

397
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,450
We don't do that--
we don't even have a vice.

398
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,661
We just want the money
your wife stole from us.

399
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,003
Stole?
How is counting cards stealing?

400
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,248
Well, it's not really stealing.

401
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,580
Is it even cheating?

402
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,165
No, but it's just not allowed.

403
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,751
I don't get it.

404
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,376
Football players
can do the quarterback sneak

405
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,383
and baseball players can steal bases.

406
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,375
Why can't I just remember
which cards have been played?

407
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,047
I can't take any more of this guy.

408
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,085
Get the vice!

409
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,468
I knew you had a vice.

410
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,894
I knew it.

411
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,522
(grunting)
I knew it.

412
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,639
I... knew it.

413
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,654
I'm sorry, Marge.

414
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:47,229
Maybe your husband's suffering
was all part of God's plan.

415
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,066
God's plan?

416
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,991
God isn't some video gamer
up there controlling us

417
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,821
like we were Pac-Men and Dig Dugs.

418
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,027
God isn't Sky Police.

419
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,657
God didn't do this.

420
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,504
I lied to my husband.

421
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,329
And made my kids lie, too.

422
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,924
We did this.

423
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:04,999
She's right.

424
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,964
We thought we could enter
the den of sin

425
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:07,964
and emerge unscathed,

426
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,585
but we were scathed.

427
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:12,221
Those free ginger ales
at the casino,

428
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,219
I-I didn't declare them on my taxes.

429
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,602
(grunts)

430
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:20,598
I'm going to do what I should have
done in the first place.

431
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,062
Put on a revue?

432
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,143
(grunts)

433
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,808
(groans)

434
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,686
<i>MARGE: Dear Lord,</i>
<i>I don't have anywhere to pray anymore,</i>

435
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,694
<i>so I've come</i>
<i>to your new temple-- here.</i>

436
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,697
<i>Um, I don't know if you watch</i>
<i>us all the time,</i>

437
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,700
<i>or if we're just like an ant farm</i>
<i>you got for your birthday</i>

438
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,333
<i>and left on the shelf,</i>
<i>and every once in a while,</i>

439
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,410
<i>you check out what kind</i>
<i>of crazy tunnels we've built.</i>

440
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,287
<i>Maybe we got it all wrong,</i>

441
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,924
<i>praying for you to give us</i>
<i>things we selfishly want.</i>

442
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,921
<i>Maybe prayer is just taking</i>
<i>a moment to tell yourself</i>

443
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,255
<i>that there is good in the universe.</i>

444
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,591
<i>And I'm going to sit here</i>
<i>and focus on that good,</i>

445
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:01,638
<i>and maybe, just maybe,</i>
<i>I'll get my husband back.</i>

446
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,194
(gasps)

447
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,436
I'm Doug Blattner,

448
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,027
COO of the gaming
and resorts division

449
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,032
of Stuffers Italian Foods.

450
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,244
My family loves your microwave lasagnas.

451
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,075
It's not my division,
but I'll tell Bill Kelley you said so.

452
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,502
Your unsanctioned religious
gathering has caused

453
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,921
a marked decrease
in gambling activities.

454
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,540
HPMs are down...
that's hands per minute.

455
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:34,087
IAMs, GDCs-- they're all down.

456
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,183
I want my husband back.

457
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,508
Hmm, let me run it by Jennifer Yang.

458
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,394
Oh, wait, she's on maternity leave.

459
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,560
Don't worry-- I'm sure
Chuck Bennett will sign off on it.

460
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,314
We are going to release your husband.

461
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,563
See, Marge, someone up in the sky
did hear your prayers.

462
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:53,226
They sure did--
casino management.

463
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,647
(grunts)

464
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,645
You are free to leave

465
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,277
as long as your faith-based
card-counting group

466
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:03,334
never return to this or any other
river or maritime casino.

467
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,160
-No deal!
-But we don't need to come back.

468
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,996
We saved the church.

469
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:11,631
No! An injustice has gone on here
for too long!

470
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,630
I'm not leaving this casino

471
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,802
until you stop punishing people
for counting cards.

472
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,432
They're just playing the game
by the rules.

473
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,890
(people cheer)

474
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:23,971
(shouts)

475
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:30,348
Homie, after all this,
do you still believe in God?

476
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,937
On a beautiful night like tonight,

477
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,983
