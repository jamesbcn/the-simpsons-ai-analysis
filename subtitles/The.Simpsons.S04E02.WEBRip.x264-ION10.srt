00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,042
Aw! Isn't that cute?

176
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,285
Me without a camera.

177
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:44,757
Here, my sister runs
a day-care center.

178
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,589
Hmm. I guess a few weeks
wouldn't hurt her.

179
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,096
{\an8}MARGE: Maggie is allergic
to strained pears

180
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,969
and she likes a bottle of
warm milk before nap time.

181
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,226
A bottle?
(laughs)

182
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,899
Mrs. Simpson, do you know
what a baby's saying

183
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,018
when she reaches
for a bottle?

184
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,314
Ba-ba?

185
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,147
She's saying, "I am a leech."

186
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,323
Our aim here is to develop
the bottle within.

187
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,413
That sounds awfully harsh.

188
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,989
Mrs. Simpson, I don't like
to toot my own horn,

189
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:16,285
but we're the only
day-care center in town

190
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,710
that's not currently under
investigation by the state.

191
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,750
Oh.

192
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,343
Well, be a good girl,
Maggie.

193
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,336
I'm sorry, Maggie.

194
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,385

207
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,456

00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,467
Good day.

Make Bart do it.

216
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,229

219
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,437
While you're off in
your own little world,

220
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,895
you forgot that other people
have problems too.

221
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,043

shove a broken bottle

Marge, every second
you spend with this man,

250

he is crushing

Bob's your uncle, mate.

But Marge,
What about dessert?

279
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,598
For God sakes, you can pull

Well, I got to go, don't I?

I'm sure you
won't enjoy it.

There's nothing about
bowling in the play.

Oh, wait, there is.

299
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,314
Probably not much of it.

little more supportive?

I can't fake an
interest in this,

303
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,435

at faking an interest

304
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,235

305
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,818
What kooky projects?

306
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,113
You know, the painting class,

307
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,066
the first aid course,
the whole Lamaze thing.

308
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,986
Why didn't you tell me
you felt this way?

309
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,155
You know I would never do
anything to hurt your feelings.
