you get electrocuted and die.

hand to touch the buttons?

164

They were discontinued
because they were thought

165
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,329
to encourage impressionable
children to smoke.

00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,988

Ew...

181
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,787
How 'bout I just
look at you.

(Spanish guitar plays)

183
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,208
El Puerco,
I must break up with you.

184
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:11,877
Oh, but the hand-holding
is just too good.

185
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,048
(grunts angrily)

186
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,635
Your juice boxes.

187
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,771
(slurps)

188
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,890
It's... nice.

189
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,398
Perhaps we can try a little
harder, for the lady.

190
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,820
Such is the life
of the juice boxiér.

191
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,403
Oh.

192
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,990
Marge, since you're by yourself,

193
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,664
would you like to borrow
one of my twins?

194
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:41,213
But remember, the one you pick
may not be the one you get.

195
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,090
Mom, I'm sorry
I'm late.

196
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:49,338
No excuse, I just forgot
all about you.

197
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,473
I'm not sure that patch really
represents who I am right now.

198
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,932
Well, if you'd been here
for the design phase,

199
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,813
you could've registered
that objection.

200
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,559
Now start quilting!

201
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,351
(melodic grunting)

202
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,145
Now there's
three of you?

203
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,018
ALL: Or maybe you're
losing your mind.

204
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,577
According to the wisdom
of our elders...

205
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,865
...if you go all the way
around on the swing,

206
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,424
your body will
turn inside-out!

207
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:29,799
Cool! Now my beauty
will be on the outside!

208

(Milhouse yelling)

209
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,603
He's still inside-in, folks!

210
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,141
And just to prove it...

211
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,854

212
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,104

Is it on your father?

Little girls always get
crushes on their fathers.

Somehow I missed that phase.

222
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,791
Almost there, boy.
Almost there.

223
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,923
Almost there.
I'm getting closer.

224
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,250
It's just within reach.

225
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,415
The boy I like
is Hemingway-esque!

226
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:58,255
Okay. Let's "esque" him
to dinner. (chuckles)

227
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:01,012
Wow, Nick here in our house!

228
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,175
I hope it doesn't make him
think less of me.

229
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,725
This house is not an
embarrassment!

230
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,056
Hm, usually when I say
something like that,

231
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,357
something extremely
embarrassing happens.

232
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:17,111
I'm gonna say good night
before it does. Good night.

233

(door bell rings)

234
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,947
Well, Lisa didn't tell me
that she had a sister.

00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,454
(chuckles)

236
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,536
Or a daughter.

237
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,329
Oh, my.

238
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,956
I don't know if anyone's
ever kissed my hand before.

239
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,344
Well, your arms are lanky.

240
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,131
It's kind of a
long trip down there.

241
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,974
My mother said
I should bring some wine.

242
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:43,009
Hmm, the French have gotten
into the wine game?

243
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,635
Ha, good luck catchin' up
with the big boys.

244
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,643
I'll get a couple glasses.

245
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,730
Mrs. Simpson, I'd like your permission
to take your daughter

246
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,232
to the Doritos Nutrition Fair
at the school gym.

247
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:58,605
Well, I usually take Lisa,
but I can just go with Bart.

248
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,244
Wait. What? No!

249
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,571
You're going with me!

250
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,115
But, Lisa, after this,

251
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,329
I don't want you to spend
so much time with this boy.

252
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,960
If you do, it'll mean you're
a separate person from me.

253
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,169
{\an8}<i>That'll stop her</i>
<i>from seeing him.</i>

254
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,843
Mom can't appreciate
the kind of boy Nick is,

255
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,296
because although I love Dad,

256
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,595
he's a completely
different creature.

257
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,929
Yeah, there's a lot
of fish in the sea,

258
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,055
but she picked out
a drunken walrus.

259
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,852
But you and this Nick fella
sound to me

260
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,856
like the story
of Pyramus and Thisbe.

261
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,609
Which inspired
<i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>

262
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,400
which inspired
<i>West Side Story,</i>

263
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,904
which inspired me to say "eh."

264
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,906
Pyramus and Thisbe were
lovers from ancient times!

265
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,660
<i>They lived next door but their</i>
<i>families despised each other.</i>

279
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:30,743
Grampa, would you help take me
on a foolish romantic mission?

280
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,368
Let me check my schedule.

281
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,584
This might work.

282
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,714
I think I'm free.

283
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,040
Tuesday's open.

284
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,125
You got it, kiddo!

285
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,626
Legend has it
a girl named Eleanor Mackie

286
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,546
drowned on this very spot.

287
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,854
Now they say if you
call her name three times

288
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,888
while looking in this mirror,
you will die.

289
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,313

291
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,694
Eleanor Mackie.
Eleanor Mackie.

292
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,815
-Eleanor Mackie!
-(all scream)

293
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,163
Aw, gimme a break.

294
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,948
The one day the lunch lady
decides to wash her hands.

295
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,874
Okay, that was
the last school myth

296
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,753
and it's officially cracked.

297
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,000
So, school is just
everything we see?

298
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,293
That's sad, man.

299
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,587

It's a Twix.

302
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,722
I can't be the guy who
killed everybody's fun.

303
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,224
That's Skinner's job.

304
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,936
Don't blame me.
You killed the fun, fun-killer.

American Girl doll day?!

309
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,397
You might be surprised at

310
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,527
the number of boys who have
American Girl dolls.

311
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,365
It's not weird 'cause
they're historic figures.

312

00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,076
I have found one
last myth to destroy,

316
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:04,297
the so-called legend of
Groundskeeper Were-Willie.

317

321
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,398
Gentlemen,
we just created a myth.

322
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,898
Now there's a myth about me
I'd like you to correct--

323
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,112
I'm not from Edinburgh!

324
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,902
I'm also not from Glasgow!

325
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,607
I'm from Kirkwall in Orkney!

326
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,698
Me father was an Uppie,
and me mother was a Doonie.

327
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,544
It tore the
family apart!

328
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,039
(sobbing)

329
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,340

-Ow!

330
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:52,852
Pull over. You're wanted for
grand theft retirement home.

331
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,098

(gunshot)

350
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,312
Thanks for the ride,
Mr. Spuckler.

351
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,404
Yeah, I don't normally
approve of out-breeding,

352
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,611
but you two seem nice.

353
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,567
We can take this boat.

354
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,658
I don't know,
this water's a little choppy.

355
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,834
I thought you rowed up the Zambezi
without a guide.

356
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,714
Right, right.

357
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,747
(sighs)

358
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,554
So, Dad, what kind of stupid idea
did you put in Lisa's head?

359
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,934
She wants to steal a kiss,
like Pyramus and Thisbe.

360
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,683
Did you say
"ultimate Frisbee"?!

361
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,135
-No!
-Oh...

362
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,814
(annoyed whining)

363
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,690
(grunting)

364
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,157
Women and shoes, am I right?

365
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,666
(grunting)

366
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,758
Your hands are really cold.

367
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:56,888
You know, you were a lot more adventurous
at the dessert table.

368
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,889
I sure was--
I'm allergic to chocolate!

369
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,721
Shut up and kiss me.

370
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,975
<i>Lisa, it's Hadley Richardson,</i>
<i>Hemingway's first wife.</i>

371
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,522
<i>Trust me,</i>
<i>you're making a big mistake.</i>

372
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,226
<i>If you don't believe me,</i>
<i>ask Pauline Pfeiffer.</i>

373
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,027
<i>I was his second wife.</i>

374
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,031
<i>There were two more after me.</i>

375
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,663
<i>Tortured writers</i>
<i>make horrible husbands.</i>

376
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,740
<i>At least you chose</i>
<i>to be with him.</i>

377
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,946
<i>I was just swimmin' along,</i>
<i>mindin' my own business.</i>

378
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,367
<i>Next thing I know,</i>
<i>I was hanging on his wall!</i>

379
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,376
<i>He used to pee</i>
<i>in the fireplace!</i>

380
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,668
<i>(sobbing)</i>

381
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,800
Wait, how long
is this love for again?

382
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,050
Eternity.

383
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,301
Oh, that's a pretty
long time.

384
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,093
Now my lips
are getting cold.

385
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,468
(panting)
Lisa!

386
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,521
This isn't working out.

387
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,890
Lisa, I'm sorry that
God gave me this gift

388
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,437
of lying to girls,
for a little while.

389
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,861
I'll see ya.

390
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,692
(panting)

391
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,026
I feel kinda silly I walked
all the way out here.

392
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:01,283
You're just fine.
You always are.

393
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,946
Thanks.
But I couldn't do it, Mom.

394
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,496
I mean, the person you kiss
under a mulberry tree

395
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,370
is someone you'll love
for the rest of your life.

396
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,474
Mwah!

397
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,545
(grunting)

398
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,807
Don't worry, ladies,
I'm-a comin'!

399
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,179
D'oh!

400
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,055
(gurgling)
D'oh...

401
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,489
You know, I heard
if a fat guy stops moving,

402
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,568
he floats.

403
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,454
D'oh!

404
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,199
Shh!

405
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,958
