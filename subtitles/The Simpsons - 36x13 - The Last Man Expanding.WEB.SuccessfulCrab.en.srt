1
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:15,022
D'oh!

2
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,807
This guy must be a pinball wizard!

3
00:00:25,884 --> 00:00:27,909
I'm at work. D'oh!

4
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,912
Hmm, something feels different.

5
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:40,230
It's 11:00 a.m.

6
00:00:40,232 --> 00:00:41,565
On a weekday.

7
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:42,899
I'm on my third beer.

8
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,085
Right on schedule.

9
00:00:45,237 --> 00:00:47,328
No, wait, Homer's right.

10
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:49,573
Something's, uh, missing.

11
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,684
Wasn't there a grade from the
health inspector over there?

12
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,578
Nah, it's always been that sign.

13
00:00:55,318 --> 00:00:57,263
Next year I hope they give me a "U."

14
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:58,598
I know what's missing.

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,008
Did a woman named Diane
used to work at this bar,

16
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:04,011
and now she's been replaced
by a woman named Rebecca?

17
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:07,866
If a woman named Diane had a
lead role in a bar like this,

18
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,517
why would she ever leave?

19
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,203
That'd be career suicide.

20
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:15,040
No, it's not some smart,
ambitious woman that's missing.

21
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:18,359
In fact,
it's the complete opposite of that.

22
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:19,439
Barney!

23
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,770
No Barney? Wha...?

24
00:01:20,772 --> 00:01:23,048
When's the last time he was here?

25
00:01:23,754 --> 00:01:24,958
Oh, oh, God!

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,626
He's been gone at least a week.

27
00:01:26,778 --> 00:01:28,035
Hi, guys.

28
00:01:28,113 --> 00:01:29,629
Beat it, string bean,
we're trying to figure out

29
00:01:29,781 --> 00:01:31,297
what happened to our friend Barney.

30
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:32,724
I'm Barney.

31
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,950
Ta-da!

32
00:01:35,954 --> 00:01:37,621
And you ain't Barney.

33
00:01:37,623 --> 00:01:39,956
Barney Gumble is overweight, boozed up,

34
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,992
can't go two seconds
without unleashing a...

35
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,903
Barney!

36
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:47,631
Uh, wow, buddy.

37
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:48,740
You really lost some weight.

38
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:51,576
Yeah, I was feeling kind of blah,

39
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,971
so I went to the doctor,
and he ordered up some tests.

40
00:01:54,973 --> 00:01:56,306
Oh, my dear friend.

41
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,824
Oh, this ain't good.

42
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,976
No! Why does God take

43
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,254
all the people that drink
themselves to death?

44
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,663
It's not that bad.

45
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,740
The tests just showed that I have...

46
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,333
"hyperglycemia."

47
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,335
So, low blood sugar?

48
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:12,597
Lenny, he said "hyper," not "hypo."

49
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:14,749
Any idiot knows the difference, idiot.

50
00:02:14,826 --> 00:02:16,826
So, Barn, you-you're not dying?

51
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:20,013
Except in the same, slow,
horrible way we all are.

52
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,165
- Soon enough, my pretties.
- _

53
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:25,444
I'm fine. They put me on this medicine

54
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:28,037
that regulates my glucose.

55
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,263
Othinquic.

56
00:02:29,265 --> 00:02:32,358
The weight loss is just a side effect.

57
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,960
Wow, a medicine that
actually makes you skinny?

58
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:45,947
That's the best side effect
since Viagra was created for...

59
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:47,691
What was Viagra created for?

60
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:50,135
I think it was to help comedy writers.

61
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,528
Oh, yeah.

62
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,696
- Yeah, you got that right.
- Those are always funny.

63
00:02:52,698 --> 00:02:54,139
Hey, let's celebrate.

64
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,308
Uh, refresh my memory, uh,

65
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,368
beer's your drink, right?

66
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,628
No, thanks.
Another welcome side effect is,

67
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:02,555
I no longer crave alcohol.

68
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:05,967
One club soda with lime, please.

69
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:07,711
Don't crave alcohol?

70
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,896
I can't let this secret get out.

71
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:11,156
What secret?

72
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,657
Wonder weight-loss drug.

73
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:14,141
Oh, hey, Lou?

74
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:16,553
Want to hear the big news
I'm gonna tell everyone?

75
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,813
Yeah, but, Chief,
the bank robbers are right over there.

76
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:22,075
And they can stay there until I
tell you this interesting fact.

77
00:03:22,227 --> 00:03:23,576
It all started at Moe's.

78
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:26,338
You know the place next to the,
uh, the music store?

79
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,656
You mean the one the bank
robbers are holed up in.

80
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:32,752
If you keep interrupting,
I'm just gonna talk slower.

81
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,763
_

82
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,395
Thanks. I need to give
something to my son.

83
00:03:42,547 --> 00:03:43,729
A calming butterscotch?

84
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,640
Never leave me alone.

85
00:03:46,718 --> 00:03:48,551
Now leave me alone. Gah!

86
00:03:48,553 --> 00:03:50,236
Wow, Chief.

87
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,904
That drug really works.

88
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,647
Go ahead, Lou, put your hand in there.

89
00:03:53,725 --> 00:03:55,816
- Hey, that's an order.
- I resign.

90
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,484
Well, even so, I got you for two weeks.

91
00:03:57,562 --> 00:03:58,562
Now stick it in.

92
00:03:58,563 --> 00:04:00,154
Yeah, r-right there, that's it.

93
00:04:00,231 --> 00:04:03,082
I mean, it has really changed my life.

94
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:04,843
Sarah and I are making whoopee again.

95
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:07,070
We're gonna have more Ralphies soon.

96
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:08,513
A big one, a girl one,

97
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:10,765
one that even looks more like Eddie.

98
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:13,576
Must try this drug.

99
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:16,020
Diet and exercise do not work for me,

100
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:17,355
as I do not do them.

101
00:04:17,506 --> 00:04:19,357
So does it come in gummy or vape?

102
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:20,766
It's in a convenient needle

103
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,843
that you inject yourself
with once a week.

104
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:25,012
But you need a prescription.

105
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,513
To the doct-arr.

106
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:29,258

America's waistbands are shrinking.

Because it makes you stop eating.

And eating is natural.

I would only go on medication

if a doctor told me to.

145
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:08,633
And I don't see doctors.

146

Uh...

00:06:27,395 --> 00:06:29,636
Well, I support you, Dad.

156

I'm proud of you for not
giving in to Big Pharma.

157
00:06:32,734 --> 00:06:36,143
The only thing I'm giving into
is big "parma."

158
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,737
At Luigi's.

159
00:06:37,813 --> 00:06:39,739

- Yay, Dad!

160
00:06:41,392 --> 00:06:43,710
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

But obesity is a major health risk.

Good one, yeah.

175
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:22,874

177
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,694
Ooh.

178
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,438
Something for both of you.

179
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,883
A six-pack and a washboard.

180
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:37,446
Or you could just let
things go as they are and...

181
00:07:37,448 --> 00:07:40,132
_

182
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,769
Yeah.

183
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,641
Homer, Homer, wake up!

184
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:50,068
I need you.

185
00:07:50,144 --> 00:07:51,385
For snuggling?

186
00:07:51,462 --> 00:07:52,962
Talking, talking.

187
00:07:52,964 --> 00:07:55,239
Oh, uh, that's just as good.

188
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,395
Totally.

189
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:57,742
Please continue.

190
00:07:57,893 --> 00:07:58,984
I've been thinking.

191
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,562
Maybe you should try to get down to...

192
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,564
fun size again.

193
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,808
But I thought you loved me for who I am.

194
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,901
I do, but I want you to see

195
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:09,995
Lisa graduate from college.

196
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:13,332
And see Bart get a good
deal on a used car.

197
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,152
Please take the medicine.

198
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,820
Okay, okay, I'll do it.

199
00:08:17,822 --> 00:08:19,505
Oh, thank you, thank you.

200
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,100
Now it's snuggling time.

201
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:27,870
I hate having eyes that can't blink.

202
00:08:30,273 --> 00:08:32,819
Oh, I tried everything to lose weight.

203
00:08:32,872 --> 00:08:36,672
I hired personal chefs,
consulted the best doctors,

204
00:08:36,674 --> 00:08:38,616
as well as Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz.

205
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,694
I even bought a weight loss company.

206
00:08:41,846 --> 00:08:43,529
You know, normal people stuff.

207
00:08:43,531 --> 00:08:45,606
But nothing worked

208
00:08:45,683 --> 00:08:48,626
until I got on Othinquic.

209
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,853
And now check this out.

210
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:53,631
I'm as thin as I was

211
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,692
on the night my boyfriend
Steadfast proposed.

212
00:08:56,694 --> 00:08:58,878
But this is permanent...

213
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:00,638
unless the drug stops working.

214
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:02,789
Which you better hope it doesn't,

215
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:05,868
because you're all going on it.

216
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,536
Look under your seats!

217
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:14,986
You get a waistline.
You get a waistline.

218
00:09:15,062 --> 00:09:17,229
Oh, I'm so generous
that it doesn't matter

219
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,881
that I'm not humble.

220
00:09:18,883 --> 00:09:22,309
And remember, only read books I like.

221
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:23,977
That drug is a miracle.

222
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,313
So when did you two go on it?

223
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,057
Uh... we didn't.

224
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:31,485
We lost this weight by exercise
and eating in moderation.

225
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:32,837
Right, moderation.

226
00:09:32,914 --> 00:09:34,563
Also, we quit smoking.

227
00:09:34,565 --> 00:09:36,657
That helps people lose weight, right?

228
00:09:36,734 --> 00:09:38,676
No, actually...

229
00:09:38,753 --> 00:09:41,253
Besides, our fiancés love it.

230
00:09:41,255 --> 00:09:42,513
- Eh?
- Eh.

231
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:43,739
Fiancés?

232
00:09:43,758 --> 00:09:45,183
You're getting married?

233
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:47,076
Yep. To people from work.

234
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:48,686
Never interested in them before.

235
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:51,096
Because they were chubbos.

236
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,098
And how did they lose weight?

237
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,767
Eating in moderation.

238
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:56,769
Well, even if they did take that drug,

239
00:09:56,771 --> 00:09:59,012
I don't think they need to be ashamed.

240
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:02,516
Homer's seeing the doctor
about getting on it right now.

241
00:10:02,593 --> 00:10:04,685
Homer? Huh, they better find a needle

242
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,187
strong enough to get through hippo hide.

243
00:10:07,265 --> 00:10:09,707
I'm sorry you don't have a
husband with the willpower

244
00:10:09,784 --> 00:10:12,710
to lose weight naturally, like us.

245
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,070
Yeah, by the way, Marge,

246
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,890
can we each borrow $900 a month?

247
00:10:17,892 --> 00:10:19,032
It's for, um...

248
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:20,817
uh... vegetables.

249
00:10:20,895 --> 00:10:22,169
And yoga pants.

250
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:25,080
If we miss one dose of yoga pants,

251
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,582
we balloon right back up.

252
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:28,676
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

253
00:10:28,677 --> 00:10:30,877
_

254
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,738
$900 a month?

255
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,014
Why is it so expensive?

256
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,590
Health insurance stopped covering it,

257
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,351
and the pharmacies are out of stock.

258
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,836
Their first priority are the
people who need it the most.

259
00:10:39,914 --> 00:10:41,413
The people who are actually sick?

260
00:10:41,415 --> 00:10:43,673
No, A-list Hollywood stars.

261
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:45,934
It's their most difficult
time of the year.

262
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:47,252
Awards season.

263
00:10:47,254 --> 00:10:48,862
So where did you get yours?

264
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,105
Oh, oh, I'm not on it.

265
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,699
I-I lost this weight naturally.

266
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:55,444
As a doctor,
I know the value of diet and exercise.

267
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,037
You've been a doctor for 20 years.

268
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,764
Why didn't you lose weight before?

269
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,691
Get out.

270
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:13,962
Do you have Othinquic?

271
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,539
No, just Sudafed, NyQuil,

272
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,634
and one of the hardest things of
all to get out of a drugstore:

273
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:21,061
razor blades.

274
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:26,233
I've, uh, heard you're looking

275
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:28,902
for a certain weight-loss vaccine.

276
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,070
You got cash?

277
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,387
Does anyone anymore?

278
00:11:31,465 --> 00:11:33,315
Not to worry, we take the Venmo.

279
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:35,743
And occasionally the Zelle.

280
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:37,319
But never the Cash App.

281
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:39,988
They offer the Bitcoin
but not the Ethereum.

282
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,416
How am I supposed to
arbitrage between the two?

283
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:43,751
Forget about it!

284
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:44,893
Hmm.

285
00:11:48,315 --> 00:11:51,333
Here you go. Pure, uncut Othinquic.

286
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:54,486
Guaranteed to reduce the labonza.

287
00:11:54,488 --> 00:11:57,990
It's the anti-antipasto.

288
00:11:57,992 --> 00:11:59,415
Where did you get this?

289
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:02,844
Let's just say a truck
lost a little weight

290
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:05,439
passing through Springfield.

291
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,257
Wait a minute,
I thought you don't get high

292
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,092
on your own supply.

293
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:12,004
I personally lost this weight

294
00:12:12,006 --> 00:12:14,689
through diet and exercise.

295
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:16,266
Even you lie about it?

296
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:19,194
If you can't trust godfathers,
who can you trust?

297
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,937
I don't cheat on diets.

298
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:23,624
I would never cheat on anything,

299
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,751
except my wife.

They look fabulous, right?

310
00:13:07,728 --> 00:13:08,894
They look sad.

311
00:13:08,896 --> 00:13:10,170
Maybe it's all that loose skin

312
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,339
sagging from their faces.

313
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,401
Hey, getting Othinquic face is
one of the few negative effects.

314
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,680
And you can always fix that
with injections of body fat.

315
00:13:19,831 --> 00:13:22,257
Trust me, I'm a wonder drug.

316
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,910
The more I see, the more I wonder.

317
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:26,019
Okay, boomer.

318
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,522
Look, weight loss is healthy.

319
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,931
No matter how.

320
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:32,767
We've done a lot of research.

321
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:34,010
On safety?

322
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:35,103
On profits.

323
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,256
The profits are 100% safe.

324
00:13:38,258 --> 00:13:40,868
And we'll find out the
dangers sooner or later.

325
00:13:40,944 --> 00:13:42,944
After everyone's already on it?

326
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:45,664
Including my husband?

327
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:51,269
Exactly.
The most enormous beta test of all time.

328
00:13:51,271 --> 00:13:53,772
And you lab rats are
paying us to be in it.

329
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,883
<i>Patetiske taber.</i>

330
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,460
Which means "suckers."

331
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:00,554
Homer!

332
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:05,450
Dad, are you sure you want to do this?

333
00:14:05,452 --> 00:14:09,170
As sure as I was that I didn't
want to do it yesterday.

334
00:14:09,322 --> 00:14:12,232
In that case, I support you,
but just barely.

335
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,401
That's what Dad's chair says.

336
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:15,903
Oh, man.

337
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:18,221
I'm gonna miss making fat jokes.

338
00:14:18,298 --> 00:14:20,073
You'll still have bald jokes.

339
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,117
It's not the same.

340
00:14:23,137 --> 00:14:24,636
Goodbye, my love handles.

341
00:14:24,638 --> 00:14:26,729
You'll be in heaven with my back fat,

342
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:28,306
my triple chin, and my...

343
00:14:28,972 --> 00:14:30,233
finger chub.

344
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,644
Stop, Homer! Stop!

345
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,828
Huh?

346
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,923
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

347
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:37,090
You're throwing it out?

348
00:14:37,242 --> 00:14:38,667
But you wanted me to take it.

349
00:14:38,743 --> 00:14:39,760
I was wrong.

350
00:14:39,836 --> 00:14:41,319
I know it's the hot new trend,

351
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,838
but so were fanny packs, tramp stamps,

352
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:45,824
and Teslas.

353
00:14:46,994 --> 00:14:48,843
I usually cover this with my fanny pack.

354
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,754
But I thought you were worried
about us growing old together.

355
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:53,515
Of course I want that.

356
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,276
But what's even more important
is that you're here with us

357
00:14:56,353 --> 00:15:00,113
right now and we can move on safely.

358
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:02,190
Hey, what are you doing?

359
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:05,510
Homer, as the only
overweight man left in town,

360
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:08,697
you have something that
we desperately need.

361
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,124
You're kidnapping my husband?

362
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,018
Think of it as a side effect

363
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,796
of not taking weight-loss drugs.

364
00:15:15,947 --> 00:15:17,172
<i>Andiamo.</i>

365
00:15:18,025 --> 00:15:19,374
No, no, no, no!

366
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,134
He's too fat to fit in the car.

367
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,061
Put him in the trunk.

368
00:15:23,063 --> 00:15:25,714
He's too fat to fit in the trunk.

369
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:27,623
Lash him to the roof.

370
00:15:27,701 --> 00:15:29,643
Uh, we're gonna need more rope.

371
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:39,879
Ooh, pork chops.

372
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,046
Aah, Fat Tony!

373
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:42,638
Ooh, pork chops.

374
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:45,583
We need your fat to fill in our faces.

375
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,511
So we can look eternally young
like the Real Housewives,

376
00:15:48,588 --> 00:15:50,088
who don't look real

377
00:15:50,164 --> 00:15:53,257
and spend all their time
outside of the house.

378
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:55,410
Now eat.<i> Mangia.</i>

379
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:58,246
What you said makes me
almost not want to eat.

380
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,264
The police are gonna be furious.

381
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,766
Actually, uh, no we're not.

382
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:02,927
Come on, swallow.

383
00:16:02,936 --> 00:16:05,177
Can't wait to get your ass in my face.

384
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,846
You monster!

385
00:16:06,923 --> 00:16:08,773
Wait till the mayor hears about this.

386
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,367
Oh, believe me, I know.

387
00:16:10,443 --> 00:16:12,685
Slim Tony and I are in cahoots.

388
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:15,354
The mayor in league with the mob?

389
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,040
I'm happy to reach across the aisle,

390
00:16:17,117 --> 00:16:19,283
as long as it's not with the members

391
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,026
of another political party.

392
00:16:22,455 --> 00:16:24,363
Give me back my husband!

393
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:28,610
Look who's here...

394
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,613
Little Miss Thin without
Having to Take Drugs.

395
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,223
Which none of us take.

396
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:38,136
You're just jealous because
we're more beautiful than you.

397
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:44,142
Now, out of the way,
because for the first time ever,

398
00:16:44,218 --> 00:16:46,461
we want your husband.

399
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,963
Well, I'm taking my husband back.

400
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:50,407
You and what army?

401
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,558
This-a army!

402
00:16:54,228 --> 00:16:56,471
We are the true victims of Ozempic...

403
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,581
I mean, eh, eh, Othinquic.

404
00:16:58,658 --> 00:17:01,643
The hard working a-people
who make-a your food.

405
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,994
And who pour your damn drinks.

406
00:17:02,996 --> 00:17:05,997
You think you could operate
a beer tap by yourself?

407
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:07,257
Yes, you could.

408
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,742
So, uh, where am I going with this?

409
00:17:09,744 --> 00:17:12,153
These-a drugs don't-a
just stop your eating.

410
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:15,006
They stop-a all of your
compulsive behavior.

411
00:17:15,158 --> 00:17:18,083
And compulsive behavior
is-a the only reason

412
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:19,677
anybody eats-a spaghetti.

413
00:17:19,754 --> 00:17:22,421
It's-a like worms with less-a nutrients.

414
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,681
<i>Hypocrito.</i>

415
00:17:23,758 --> 00:17:25,591
Criticizing us when you're clearly

416
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,593
riding the O-train yourself.

417
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,371
I'm-a not-a taking the drugs.

418
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:34,025
Yeah, we know: "Diet and exercise."

419
00:17:34,027 --> 00:17:36,527
No! I lost-a weight legitimately

420
00:17:36,604 --> 00:17:38,362
from-a severe depression.

421
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,682
You, you're-a ruining my life.

422
00:17:47,632 --> 00:17:50,208
Homer, they took your tuchus!

423
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:53,211
You can't leave me like this.

424
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,046
I'm like the Batman villain Two-Face,

425
00:17:55,198 --> 00:17:57,882
beautiful on one side
and hideous on the other.

426
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,066
Uh...

427
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:00,960
Which is the beautiful side again?

428
00:18:01,037 --> 00:18:04,463
Here's a thought:
maybe you can all stop taking the drug.

429
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,149
If I knew the meaning
of the word "stop,"

430
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,485
I would not be taking it. Der.

431
00:18:08,561 --> 00:18:10,061
Look at your faces.

432
00:18:10,063 --> 00:18:11,546
Mm...

433
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,563
Let me try.

434
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,383
I've had more experience
addressing mobs.

435
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:21,222
I am the last fat man in Springfield.

436
00:18:21,224 --> 00:18:22,982
And while I can't see my feet,

437
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,226
I can see something else.

438
00:18:25,228 --> 00:18:28,079
You are all unhappy.

439
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:30,673
- Love people for what's inside...
- Mm-hmm.

440
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:33,492
...lots of delicious food.

441
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,404
And admire the ingenuity
of the American chemist,

442
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,831
who has designed potato
chips that make you hungrier,

443
00:18:38,908 --> 00:18:40,833
sodas that makes you thirstier,

444
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:43,853
all-you-can-eat restaurants that
make you never feel full again.

445
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:47,524
We sit eating food,
watching TV about food,

446
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,267
with commercials

447
00:18:49,343 --> 00:18:50,935
for more food!

448
00:18:51,012 --> 00:18:54,179
Food-S-A! Food-S-A!

449
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:58,017
Gol'darnit! Replace the word
"America" with the word "Texas,"

450
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:00,686
and I agree with everything you said.

451
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,374
I'm getting off this stuff.

452
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,543
And back on statins, antidepressants,

453
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,128
mood elevators, and useless vitamins.

454
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,049
Is my old table available?

455
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,959
Yes-a, yes and the gun

456
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:17,369
is still-a behind-a the toilet for you.

457
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:20,974
Is a happy end.

458
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,212
Patty and Selma gained back the weight

459
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,065
and lost the fiancés.

460
00:19:29,142 --> 00:19:32,551
They're doing a group
sologamy celebration instead.

461
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,887
Salami celebration, what's that?

462
00:19:34,906 --> 00:19:37,481
It's when a person marries themselves,

463
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:39,967
but there'll be two of
them doing it together.

464
00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:41,411
But not to be together.

465
00:19:41,487 --> 00:19:43,228
Even though they live together.

466
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,472
Good night, sweetheart.

467
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,623
Mwah.

468
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,879
_

469
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,739
So what are you going to wear?

470
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,317
That strapless black dress, right?

471
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:58,428
Well, it's from before I had kids.

472
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,430
I doubt it still fits.

473
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:03,099
The ceremony is still a month away.

474
00:20:03,176 --> 00:20:06,752
And I'm exactly a month's supply.

475
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,255
After everything I've seen,
why should I trust you?

476
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,774
It's just a month.

477
00:20:11,926 --> 00:20:13,334
One and done.

478
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:16,613
Hmm, I would love to wear that dress.

479
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:20,599
Whoa, ooh.

480
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:22,744
I feel a little nauseous.

481
00:20:23,604 --> 00:20:25,437
Why is everything black?

482
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,864
Did I lose my vision?

483
00:20:27,016 --> 00:20:28,532
Blindness is a side effect, but that's

484
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:30,184
only three percent of cases.
