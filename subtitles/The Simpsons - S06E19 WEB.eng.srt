1
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:06,131
The Simpsons.

2
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,919
Zounds! I did thee
mightily smitely.

3
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,757
"Zounds" is
a Renaissance English word

4
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,675
short for "God's wounds."

5
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,886
But "Smitely,"
that's pure Flanders.

6
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,597
Please call a doctor.

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,100
Oh, these Renaissance Faires
are so boring.

8
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,268
Oh, really?

9
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,020
Did you see
the loom?

10
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,190
I took loom
in high school.

11
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,614
Meh.

12
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,205
Yon meat 'tis sweet
as summer's wafting breeze.

13
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,539
Can I have some?

14
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,892
Mine ears are open
only to the pleas

15
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,251
of those who speak
ye olde English.

16
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,628
Sweet maiden
of the spit

17
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,755
grant now my boon,
that I might sup

18
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,673
upon suckling pig
this noon.

19
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,175
Whatever.

20
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,095
Oh, I've eaten
eight different meats.

21
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,596
I'm a true Renaissance man.

22
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,724
I'll go to the first aid tent

23
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,185
and tell them to plug in
ye olde stomach pump.

24
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,147
Alight your gaze

25
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,818
on yonder fabled beasts of yore.

26
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,448
Behold the rarest
of the rare,

27
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,118
the mythological
two-headed hound

28
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,161
born with only one head.

29
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,371
Ooh. And here

30
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,956
out of the mists
of history,

31
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,125
the legendary esquilax...

32
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,435
A horse with the head
of a rabbit

33
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:11,047
and the body of a rabbit.

34
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,466
Oh, it's
galloping away.

35
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,468
Here, bunny, bunny.
Here, bunny.

36
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,552
Here, esquilax.

37
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,651
I've been waiting
for you, Lisa.

38
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,570
How did you know my name?!

39
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,653
Your name tag.

40
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,159
Would you like to
know your future?

41
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,035
Sorry, I don't believe
in fortune telling.

42
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,495
I should go.

43
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,872
What's your hurry?

44
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,432
Bart, Maggie and Marge
are at the joust

45
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,126
and Homer is heckling
the puppet show.

46
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,379
Wow. You can see
into the... present.

47
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,465
Now we'll see what
the future holds.

48
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,594
The death card?

49
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,095
No, that's good.

50
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,431
It means
transition, change.

51
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,017
Oh, that's cute.

52
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,935
The happy squirrel!

53
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:06,936
That's bad?

54
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,271
Possibly.

55
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,481
The cards are vague
and mysterious.

56
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,025
They seem to
be revealing

57
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,985
the story of
your first love.

58
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,820
Do you want me
to continue?

59
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,031
Guess so.

60
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,201
It's... It's coming to me.

61
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:26,414
Yes, I see an eastern university
in the year 2010.

62
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:29,834
The world has become
a very different place.

63
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,348
I can't wait
to see that play.

64
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,278
- Hey, watch it.
- Watch it.

65
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,781
That man is instantly

66
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,407
the most annoying person
I've ever met.

67
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,827
A soy-based snack
will calm me down.

68
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,340
Him again!

69
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,644
Hello. I need "Ecosystem
of the Marsh" by Thompson.

70
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:33,439
The last copy was just
signed out by, um...

71
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,024
Hugh Parkfield.

72
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,401
Oh, there he is.

73
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,484
No!

74
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,362
It couldn't be.

75
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,991
Thanks for holding my book
while I tied my shoe.

76
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,827
That's the book I need.

77
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,510
You'll probably take
forever with it too.

78
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,658
I can read faster than you.

79
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,164
I read at a 78th grade level.

80
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,248
Right here.

81
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,214
- Finish this page?
- Ages ago.

82
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,467
- I'll get a dictionary.
- Why?

83
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,529
You'll see when you get there.
The word "stochastic."

84
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,721
"Pertaining to a process

85
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,906
"involving a
randomly determined

86
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,931
sequence of
observations."

87
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,896
Hmm. First
they hate each other,

88
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,857
now, all of a sudden,
they love each other.

89
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,734
It doesn't make
any sense to me.

90
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,527
Of course not.
You're a robot.

91
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,748
I've never met anyone
who so understood

92
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,749
the magic of Jim Carrey.

93
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,167
He can make you laugh

94
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,627
with no more than frantic
flailing of his limbs.

95
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,629
I can't believe

96
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,881
how much we have
in common.

97
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,841
We're both studying
the environment,

98
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,344
we're both utterly humorless
about our vegetarianism

99
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,346
and we both love
The Rolling Stones.

100
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,724
Yes, not for their music,
but for their tireless efforts

101
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,351
to preserve
historic buildings.

102
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,685
Lisa, I can't bear
the thought

103
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,954
of being apart from you
all summer.

104
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:54,997
Come back with me
to Parkfield Manor.

105
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,689
I'd love to.

106
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,900
Can we get vegetarian meals
at your parent's house?

107
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,234
Yes, we can, Lisa.

108
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,820
That is good because
eating animals is wrong.

109
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,946
So very wrong.

110
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,531
When will the
world learn?

111
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,657
I don't know.

112
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,326
I just don't know.

113
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,538
I love these
new planes.

114
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,974
Yes, it's a good thing
they reevaluated

115
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,458
those wacky old designs.

116
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,847
Beautiful dinnerware,
Mrs. Parkfield.

117
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,557
Thank you, Lisa.
They were made

118
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,309
for the finest
family in Britain.

119
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,145
I don't know
how we ended up with them.

120
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,272
Uh-oh. Should I laugh?

121
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,441
Was that dry British wit,
or subtle self-pity?

122
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,443
They're staring at me.
Better respond.

123
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:48,616
Oh, it's good to hear
a boisterous American laugh.

124
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,118
And I love
that painting.

125
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,662
Judging by the clothes,
I'd say 17th century.

126
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,581
Actually, Lisa,
it's just Uncle Eldred.

127
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:59,168
I get me brain medicines
from the National Health.

128
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,923
This place
is so enchanting, Hugh.

129
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,258
I love it here.

130
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,884
I wanted this
to be perfect for you.

131
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,138
I know you Americans
like everything to be...

132
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,222
fireworks.

133
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,777
Oh, blast!

134
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,821
Go to plan B.

135
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,409
Yes, I will.

136
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,664
Isn't it wonderful?

137
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:40,668
Master Hugh
has found a true love.

138
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,514
Hi, Mom.

139
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,308
Lisa, hello.

140
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,934
How are you doing
in England?

141
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,853
Remember, an elevator
is called a "lift,"

142
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,396
a mile is called
a "kilometer,"

143
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,607
and botulism is called
"steak and kidney pie."

144
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,901
Guess what?
Hugh and I are getting married.

145
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,527
All right!

146
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,405
Lisa, that's wonderful.

147
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,159
If only your father
was still with us...

148
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,703
but he left for work
a few minutes ago.

149
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,996
Mom, remember
when I was little

150
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,706
we'd always plan
my dream wedding

151
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:22,293
and you always promised to...
you know, well...

152
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,587
keep Dad from ruining it?

153
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,297
Oh, don't worry, honey.

154
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,674
I guarantee
your father will behave.

155
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,259
Mom, it's a picture phone.

156
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,094
Oh, this? This?

157
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,018
Oh, no, I've just got
a touch of the rheumatiz.

158
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,598
Mom, picture phone.

159
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,479
Hi, Mom.
That's great news about Lisa.

160
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,189
Well, listen,
I better get back to work.

161
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,276
They're finally
paying me for this.

162
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,447
Oh, yeah!

163
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,669
Yes, but the international
market is my focus.

164
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:05,795
Whoo-hoo!

165
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,381
Ah, Marge, that's great news!

166
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,008
Hey, hey, there with
the personal calls, Simpson.

167
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,553
Oh, uh, but Mr. Milhouse

168
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,916
my little girl's
getting married.

169
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,097
Lisa?

170
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,100
Oh... My one true love.

171
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,019
It's not you, Milhouse.

172
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,938
I just don't plan
to ever get married.

173
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,154
I think I'll write your
performance evaluation now,

174
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,238
Simpson.

175
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,621
Oh, I got to call everyone

176
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,956
and tell them the good news.

177
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,626
Maggie! I need to use the phone!

178
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,630
Will that girl ever shut up?

179
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,549
Okay, Marge,
I'll plan everything.

180
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,259
We can have
the reception at Moe's.

181
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,261
Wait! Why not have
the whole wedding there?

182
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,846
We'll do it
on a Monday morning...

183
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,222
There'll be fewer drunks.

184
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,016
Homer, don't take
this personally

185
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,475
but I've obtained
a court order

186
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,199
to prevent you from
planning this wedding.

187
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,123
Well,
these seem to be in order.

188
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,387
I'll be out back
in the hammock.

189
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,945
"Mr. Smithers plus guest."

190
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,531
Huh! There's only one person
I would want to bring.

191
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,454
Oh, Mr. Burns,
we'll thaw you out

192
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,872
the second they
discover the cure

193
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,124
for 17 stab wounds
in the back.

194
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,207
How we doing, boys?

195
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,501
Well, we're up to 15.

196
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,262
Now turn to
the next problem.

197
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,057
If you have three Pepsis
and drink one

198
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,017
how much more refreshed
are you?

199
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,828
You, the redhead in
the Chicago school system?

200
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:45,936
Pepsi?

201
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,020
Partial credit.

202
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,650
We've been invited
to the wedding

203
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,943
of our only graduate to
read at an adult level.

204
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,488
It must be Lisa Simpson.
Because, of course,

205
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,157
Martin Prince perished
in that science fair explosion.

206
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,119
Not quite perished,
my lady love.

207
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,039
Although some days,
I wish I had.

208
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,889
Hey, I remember you.
Mayor Quimby, right?

209
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:26,227
Uh, no. Look at this license...
Mohamed Jafar.

210
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,062
Quimby, after this fare

211
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,831
get your indicted ass out to
the convention center.

212
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,191
I cut the ribbon
at that convention center.

213
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,072
Just a couple more blocks
to my house.

214
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,244
Lisa, darling,
don't worry.

215
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,204
I'm sure I'll get along
with your family.

216
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,164
You've so thoroughly
prepared me for the worst.

217
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,725
As long as they're not
squatting in a ditch

218
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,085
poking berries
up their noses.

219
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,628
And if they are?

220
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,507
Here they come!
Raise the flag!

221
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,137
Oh, Lisa!

222
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,722
Yo, Hugh!

223
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,141
Here's a little bit
of U.S. hospitality.

224
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,851
What do you think of that?

225
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,813
Dad!

226
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,817
Now throw compost on it.

227
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,322
Enjoy.

228
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,993
Still warm.

229
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,769
You can be the first
to try out

230
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,420
the new guest bedroom I built.

231
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,422
Remember, if the building
inspector comes by

232
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,865
it's not a room,
it's a window box.

233
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,677
Oh, Hugh, thank you.

234
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,638
You've been just wonderful
through this entire ordeal.

235
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,098
Lisa,
I love you so much

236
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,542
I'm willing to go
through anything.

237
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,062
Are you okay?

238
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,773
I'm fine, Lisa.

239
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,774
Fortunately,
the compost heap

240
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,400
broke my fall.

241
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,319
Be a dear, run a bath.

242
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:05,075
Homer, Bart, Maggie,
company eating rules, huh?

243
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,119
Oh, right.

244
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,664
Anyway, Hugh,

245
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,501
there's more to my life
than just the wrecking ball.

246
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,461
I also crush cars into cubes.

247
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,088
And on the side, I promote
local tough man contests.

248
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,566
Basically, I'm getting out
all my aggression

249
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,175
till I go to law school.

250
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,094
So, Hugh, have you heard all
the latest American jokes?

251
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,262
Here's a good one.

252
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,806
Pull my finger.

253
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,600
Oh, yes, we have that one
in England too, Mr. Simpson.

254
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,519
I said, pull my finger!

255
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,230
Mom, we've got my wedding dress
fitting this afternoon.

256
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,540
Maggie, if you're
not doing anything,

257
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,358
why don't you
come with us?

258
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,027
Maggie, don't talk
with your mouth full!

259
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,391
Me and Bart will take Hugh
out on the town this afternoon.

260
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,365
Hugh should take it easy
because of his fall.

261
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,116
Oh, Lisa, please.
The only thing bruised

262
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,409
in that fall was my spine.

263
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,953
I'll be delighted.

264
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,872
Great. There's only one thing
I ask in return.

265
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,666
- Certainly.
- Pull my finger!

266
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,293
So, this driving
on the left

267
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,962
makes you feel
more at home, huh, Hugh?

268
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,465
And tonight,

269
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,717
the following celebrities
have been arrested...

270
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,346
while Heather Locklear
Fortensky

271
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,848
remains at large.

272
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,516
Remember, if you see
any celebrities

273
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,600
consider them dangerous.

274
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,769
You know, I rather
like this pub.

275
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,063
Oh-ho! An English boy, huh?

276
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,440
You know, we saved your ass
in World War II.

277
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,693
Yeah, well we saved
your ass in World War III.

278
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,278
That's true.

279
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,113
Hugh, there's something
I want you to have.

280
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,073
My dad gave me
his cufflinks to wear

281
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,616
on the day
I married Marge

282
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,243
and they brought
us good luck.

283
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,328
I couldn't imagine
a happier marriage.

284
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,582
We don't have many
traditions in our family

285
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,749
but it'd mean
a lot to me

286
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,211
if you kept
this one alive.

287
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,296
Well, I'd be honored.

288
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,923
To...

289
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,092
wear those... things.

290
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,974
Hey, watch those
virtual darts!

291
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,517
I'm trying to play
virtual pool.

292
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,728
Ow! Why you!

293
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,773
Hey! Hey!
No fighting in my bar!

294
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,946
You know,
Fox turned into

295
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,490
a hard-core sex
channel so gradually

296
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,742
I didn't even notice.

297
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,327
Eesh!

298
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,971
Marge, it's so great
to have the whole family

299
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,204
together under one roof.

300
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,790
I never realized
how much I missed it.

301
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,043
Listen to the murmurs
in the next room.

302
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,296
The house is full
of life again.

303
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,049
Keep it down in there!

304
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,259
All right, Dad!

305
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,803
I'm sorry I left you alone
with Homer and Bart.

306
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,473
No, no, honey.
We had a fine time.

307
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,236
How did you get that gash
on your forehead?

308
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,785
Oh, that was when
we hid in the dumpster

309
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,144
after the fire alarm
went off

310
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,747
in the pornographic
magazine warehouse.

311
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,607
Oh... You are so good
to put up with all of this.

312
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,734
Oh, don't be silly, Lisa.

313
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,278
Everything's fine...
Really.

314
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,030
Now go to sleep.

315
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,907
We have a big day
ahead of us tomorrow.

316
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,243
A big, long day.

317
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,086
Lisa, I can't believe

318
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,796
it's your
wedding day already.

319
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,090
Mom, I feel kind of
funny wearing white.

320
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,092
I mean, Milhouse...

321
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,718
Oh, Milhouse doesn't count.

322
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,350
Okay, I've got
something old,

323
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,726
that's my pearl necklace.

324
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,395
Something new
is the wedding dress.

325
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,230
Something borrowed
is this antique brooch

326
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,481
from Hugh's mother.

327
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,764
Now I just need
something blue.

328
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,610
Here.

329
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,279
Oh, Mom, thanks.

330
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,746
Hi!

331
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,874
Wow, Lisa,
looking at you

332
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,209
makes me want
to get married

333
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,752
for a third time.

334
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,295
I met a really
nice exotic dancer

335
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,214
the other night
at Hugh's bachelor party.

336
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,882
Hugh didn't have
a bachelor party.

337
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:49,966
We had one in his honor.

338
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,468
I had one in his honor.

339
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,514
I went to a strip club.

340
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,393
Well, here goes nothing.

341
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:05,274
Mom, Dad, meet...

342
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,357
Homer Simpson.

343
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,027
- How do you do?
- How are you?

344
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,278
Nice to meet you.

345
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,908
You know what's great
about you English?

346
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,368
"Octopussy."

347
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,747
Man, I must have
seen that movie... twice.

348
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,123
Yes...

349
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,958
Yes!

350
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,293
Well, that's not too bad.

351
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,922
Hey, Krabappel.

352
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,549
You get in the way
of that bouquet,

353
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,217
I'll stuff that sun hat
down your neck.

354
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,179
Smithers, take me home.

355
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,388
I'm not fully defrosted.

356
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,890
Nonsense.

357
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,475
Just sit down
and rest for a moment.

358
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,934
Here you go.

359
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,936
Oh, no.

360
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,897
We've got a little
situation here.

361
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,608
I can't feel anything
below my cummerbund.

362
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,193
Ooh-la-la!

363
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,360
Hi, Dad.

364
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,071
You look great,
sweetheart.

365
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,197
Thanks.

366
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,908
Little Lisa,
Lisa Simpson.

367
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,594
You know, I always felt
you were the best thing

368
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,161
my name ever got
attached to.

369
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,455
Since the time you learned
to pin your own diapers,

370
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,707
you've been smarter than me.

371
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,543
- Oh, Dad.
- No, no. Let me finish.

372
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,480
I just want you to know,
I've always been proud of you.

373
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,255
You're my greatest
accomplishment

374
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,257
and you did it
all yourself.

375
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,843
You helped me understand
my own wife better

376
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,637
and taught me to be
a better person

377
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,639
but you're also my daughter.

378
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,975
I don't think anybody could have
had a better daughter than...

379
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,520
- Dad, you're babbling.
- See? You're still helping me.

380
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,442
Hey, Dad, did you forget to
give those cufflinks to Hugh?

381
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,320
- Uh... no.
- Well?

382
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,239
I found them on
the nightstand this morning.

383
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,341
I guess they weren't
his cup of tea.

384
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,741
Don't worry about it.

385
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,469
But you've been going on
about these all week.

386
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,036
I'm sure he just forgot.

387
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,248
Lisa! We're not
supposed to see

388
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,499
each other
before the wedding.

389
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,834
It's tradition.

390
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,211
What about
my family's tradition?

391
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,588
Surely, you don't want
me to wear those

392
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,465
in front of my parents
and their friends?

393
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,259
But you promised
my dad you would.

394
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,136
I was just humoring
him, darling.

395
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,012
Actually, he frightens
me a bit.

396
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,806
I know they look
a little silly

397
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,700
but his feelings will be hurt
if you don't wear them.

398
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,309
Fine.

399
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,936
I must say,
you were right.

400
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,021
This has been quite trying.

401
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,274
You know, I've attempted
to enjoy your family

402
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,484
on a personal level,
on an ironic level,

403
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,612
as a novelty, as camp,
as kitsch,

404
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,906
as a cautionary example...
Nothing works.

405
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,367
Frankly, I'll be quite relieved
when we get back to England

406
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,952
and we won't have
to deal with them.

407
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,163
Are you saying we won't
see my family again?

408
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,515
Well, possibly
your mother will come

409
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,915
when the children are born.

410
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,542
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.

411
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,936
I don't want to cut
my family out of my life.

412
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,378
Oh, really?

413
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,422
But Lisa, you're better
than this place...

414
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,966
You're like a flower that grew
out of a pot of dirt.

415
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,302
That's a horrible
thing to say!

416
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,721
Oh, come on, you complain
about them more than anyone.

417
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,473
Maybe,
but I still love them,

418
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,185
and I don't think
you understand that.

419
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,401
And now,
to sing "Amazing Grace".

420
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,484
Miss Maggie Simpson.

421
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,071
She's quite a hellion

422
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,449
but she does have
an incredible voice.

423
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,620
Stop everything!

424
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,943
The wedding has been
called off.

425
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,755
Uh, this is very sad news

426
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,381
and it never would've happened

427
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,343
if the wedding had been
inside the church with God

428
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:23,430
instead of out here in the
cheap showiness of nature.

429
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,640
Who wants cake?

430
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,785
The next day,
Hugh goes back to England

431
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,037
and you never see him again.

432
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,331
Wow! Now that
I know all this

433
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,124
isn't there any way
to change the future?

434
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,835
No, but try to look surprised.

435
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,897
I thought you said you'd
tell me about my true love.

436
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,465
Oh, you'll have
a true love

437
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,342
but I specialize in foretelling

438
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,344
the relationships where
you get jerked around.

439
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,318
Lisa! Lisa!
Where were you?

440
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,842
You missed the most
incredible thing!

441
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,446
Hi, Dad.

442
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,824
I ate seven pounds of fudge!

443
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,284
Wow!

444
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,803
The man at the stand
said it was a record.

445
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,120
Wow, what else
did you do, Dad?

446
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,122
I rode the teacups.

447
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,045
Then I got a little sick
and I had to sit down.

448
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,209
But then I rode them again...
