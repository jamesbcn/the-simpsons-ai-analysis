{\an8}DR. HIBBERT:
Yet again, Homer will be fine.

25
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,229
{\an8}Mm. He's been sleeping
an awful lot.

26

{\an8}Look at these vacation photos.

00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,817
{\an8}Man, you people sure
take a lot of vacations.

30
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,407
{\an8}MARGE: That's just to remind me
where I parked.

31
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,833
{\an8}Hmm. I think I have an idea
of what might be going on.

{\an8}(gasps)
Huh? What?

33
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,504
{\an8}First, you're gonna need
a spinal tap.

34
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,543
{\an8}Please be the band.
Please be the band.

35
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,997
{\an8}Oh!

36
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,547
{\an8}Aren't you supposed
to give him anesthetic?

37
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,761
{\an8}Oh, I knew I forgot something.

38

{\an8}Doctor, is it time to pull the plug
on my father?

43
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,318
{\an8}No, wait.
I'll spare you that painful decision.

44
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,031
{\an8}HOMER: No, Bart! That's the TV!

45
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,612
{\an8}Ha-ha! That's the other guy.

46
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:54,606
{\an8}Stop that!

{\an8}(laughs)

48
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,945
{\an8}Narcolepsy's merely
sleeping sickness,

49
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,874
{\an8}and many narcoleptics
do lead normal lives

50
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,913
{\an8}by avoiding stressful triggers

51
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,416
{\an8}like, uh, oh, let's say...

52
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,419
{\an8}-Helping with the laundry?
-Exactly.

54

{\an8}(gruff voice)
Don't play with me, man.

55
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,049
{\an8}I will mess you up.

56
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,882
{\an8}Here's a signed certification
of your condition.

57
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,758
{\an8}This is a bona fide
medical excuse

58
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,055
{\an8}from doing anything
you find taxing.

59
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,599
{\an8}But you'll only use that

60
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,392
{\an8}when absolutely necessary,
right, Homie?

61
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,886
{\an8}Marge, please!

62
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,808
{\an8}I'll probably never use it.

63
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,816
{\an8}Dad, can you drive me
to Milhouse's?

64
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:29,898
{\an8}Narcolepsy.

65

{\an8}There's a spider in my room!

66
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:32,904
{\an8}Narcolepsy.

67
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,316
{\an8}Dr. Hibbert called in a prescription

68

{\an8}Narcolepsy.

69
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,282
{\an8}Yes, <i>for</i> narcolepsy,

70
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,826

71
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,949
{\an8}You can't spend
half your life napping.

72
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,246
{\an8}Maggie does,
and you think she's adorable.

73
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,460
{\an8}Yes, because babies
are always cute.

Homie, you have no idea
what it's like

80
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,433
being married to you.

81
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,885

Yeah, but what kind
of food, girly?

Stuffed cabbage?
A nice bowl soup?

so how's Thursday at 1:00?

Oh, you know it's funny
that you should say "one,"

99
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,353
'cause that's how many
grandchildren that I have.

100
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,854
I'm gonna have grandchildren

101
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,896

I get through this line.

102
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,149

I smell beer.

00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,536
Did you go to Moe's?

110
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,832
Every time I have beer
on my breath,

111
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,536
you assume I've been drinking.

112
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,746

113
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,336
Oh, that's a long one.

114

Did you at least
get the medicine?

115
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,843
I tried.
And I failed, miserably.

116
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,506
But I'm willing to work this out
in counseling.

117
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,345
(groans) We've been
to every counselor

118
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,770
from Avery to Zabinsky.

119
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,269

123
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,067
Okay, I think we got
a little off-track here.

124
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,864
I know this marriage
isn't perfect,

125
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,238
or even great,
but now I treasure the moments

126
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,906
where it's just so-so.

127
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,455
-(snoring)
-I'd kill for "okay."

128
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,249
Please, please,
just tell me what to do.

129
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,753
I've never said this--

130
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,625
and I don't even know
if I'm supposed to say this--

131
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,882
but this marriage is rotting
with the stench of death.

132
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,875
Oh, that seems a little strong.

133
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,548
How about reeking like
a trash can in a dog park?

134
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,387
Does my marriage have to be
something you can smell?

135
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,603
(snoring)

136
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,644
You see, Marge? You see?

137
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,228
The only way you and Homer
will ever be happy

138
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:18,074
is to spend a little time apart,
followed by more time apart,

139
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,741
followed by a divorce.

140
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,239
What?!

141
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,781
What is...
What, what's going on?

142
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,244
Wait, no, no, no,
I remember.

143
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,244
Happy anniversary.

144
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,906
Homer, Homer, listen to me.

145
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,834
There's just so much
I can take.

146
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,582
No, we can save this.

147
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,964
We'll go to a therapist.

148
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,421
We're at a therapist.

149
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,250
How you doin'?

150
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,166
What's going on here?

151

(sobbing)

152
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,592
Nothing.

153
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,755
Everything's fine.

154
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,803
-See?

155
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,967
I'll love you forever.

Kids, a professional felt

157
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,636
the best way
for your father and me

158
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,976
to work on our relationship
was to give up on it.

159
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,443
But after a while,
Dad's coming back?

160
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,983
-Oh, yeah, of course.
-Maybe not.

161
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,698
Oh, Marge, after all my divorce-worthy
statements and actions--

162
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,320
many of which
you don't know about--

163
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,276
how can you kick me out
now that I'm sick?

164
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,698
Narcolepsy is a serious thing.

165
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,457
Maybe because you didn't take it
seriously enough.

166
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,420
I pity you!

00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,343
Why is Daddy going away?

00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,677
Is it my fault?

170

Just kidding.
I have been waiting for this.

Yes, that's it!

354
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,777
And the great thing is
he will never melt.

355
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,025
Man, I would love to get back
into snowman shape.

356
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,578
I can't even fit
in my scarf anymore.

357
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,461
Whoa, this is serious.

358
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,290
Complimentary tattoos.

359
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,205
Yeah, I've always been looking
for the very special lady

360
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,875
who would match up with this.

361
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,471
(whinnying)

362
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,509
All right, very funny.

363
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,802
You two celebrating or what?

364
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,545
Two Scorpinos, Moe.

365
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,046
Scorpinos, you got it.

366
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,888
And those are served in a...?

367
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,313
Champagne flute.

368
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,731
Champagne flute, got it.

369
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,639
And that is a...?

370
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,558
Glass! A clean glass.

371
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,977
Ah, coming right up there,
Your Highness.

372
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,776
(quietly)
Nut case.

373
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,610
(car engine revs, tires squeal)

374
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,660
Wow, Homer,
you really stuck the landing

375
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,203
after your separation.

376
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,576
Yeah, it's great.

377
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,673
Except her friends
are always over.

378
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,919
I've been there for three weeks,
and I can't find the TV.

379
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,503
And no one has any problems,

380
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,418
except they talk about them
endlessly.

381
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,046
Kind of like you're doing now?

382
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,223
And the weirdest thing of all is

383
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,352
now she wants me
to meet her dad.

384
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,179
Wow, who pays for that dinner?

385
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,024
I plan to pretend
there's a bug in my food

386
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,389
and get the meal for free.

387
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,596
Smooth.

388
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,227
H-Hello, sir.

389
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,363
Thank you for inviting me
to dinner, sir.

390
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,860
Homer, relax.

391
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,442
I have no problem
with the age difference

392
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,066
between you and my daughter.

393
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,863
In fact, I've been dating
a much younger woman myself.

394
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,698
Oh, here she comes now.

395
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,913
(humming happily)

396
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,543
-(gasp)
-(gasp)

397
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,208
Okay, okay,
we can be adults about this.

398
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,290
Waiter, champagne?

399
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,963
(sputtering)

400
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,217
So I can't date an older man,

401
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,894
but your girlfriend can?

402
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,933
She's not my girlfriend.

403
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,306
Candace and I don't use labels.

404
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,404
Mm, doesn't look like she uses
that much shampoo either.

405
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,770
Lay off my girlfriend!

406
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,066
Roger is great with the kids.

407
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,780
He even taught Bart
how to bunt.

408
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,740
Oh, so now you're super dad?

409
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,611
When I was a kid,
you were never around.

410
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,068
You missed my high school play.

411
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,077
You told me not to come.

412
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,999
You're supposed
to fight me on that!

413
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,748
Well, Marge,
your Roger's not so perfect now.

414
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,342
He's got a screwed-up daughter
with a pathetic boyfriend.

415
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,249
Candace, dear, I apologize.

416
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,917
I'm trying so hard
to set my life right.

417
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,797
Oh, speaking of which.

418
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,143
Marge, I am going to do
something I should've done

419
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,849
three weeks ago when I met you.

420
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,309
Will you marry me, Marge?

421
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,429
Yes.

422
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,515
As soon as my divorce is final.

423
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,940
Then you can put a ring
on my finger, Homer.

424
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,440
I'm already pregnant.

425
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,691
You're pregnant?!

426
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,482
But I kept my shirt on!

427
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,396
(echoing)
No!

428
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,697
(snoring)

429
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,608
Huh? What am I doing here?

430
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,117
Sleeping through
our therapy session.

431
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,289
Dreaming only about you.

432
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,699
So none of it happened?

433
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:19,957
We're still together?

434
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,959
-Somehow.
-Whoo-hoo!

435
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,131
And you thought our only option
was to break up.

436
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,670
I never said that.

437
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,634
If I told people
that didn't belong together

438
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,554
they shouldn't be together,
I'd be out of a job.

439
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,643
Huh,
I must have dreamed that, too.

440
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,639
Okay, why don't you tell us more
about this dream?

441
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,472
All you need to know
about my dream

442
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,887
is that Marge and I have been
completely turned around by it,

443
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,727
and like Scrooge,
I will demonstrate

444
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:47,232
I have learned my lesson
by making a boy run to the store

445
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,066
and buy me a goose.

446
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,861
I think you're going to have
to do a little more, Homer.

447
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,735
Oh, I'll do a lot more
than a little more!

448
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,533
I'll do some!

449
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,487
If you could just be good
for a month,

450
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,497
that would really
show me something.

451
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,079
Absolutely.

452
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,004
Can the month be February?

453
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,173
Okay, March.

454
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,420
(groans)

455
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,591
You did it, Homie!

456
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,671
And what a March it was.

457
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,337
A beautiful Easter,
a sober St. Patrick's Day,

458
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,097
and impeccable behavior

459
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,179
watching the NCAA
basketball tournament.

460
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,925
{\an8}Mm-hmm!

461
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,387
And with your love, Dad,

462
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,847
I'm eating meat and Maggie's talking.

00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,856

(grunts)
Huh? Huh? Huh?

470
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,578
I got you one of those beers
you enjoy unironically.

471
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,706
This won a blue ribbon in 1890?

472
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,134
What does that mean?

473
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,262
Wait, so this is reality?

474
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,049
That other dream
was just a dream?

475
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:58,393
No...!

476
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,220
But you forgot to pay!

477
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,465
(distant)
Oh!

478
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,558
(whimpering)

479
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,654
(gasps)

480
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,227
(sobbing)

481
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,316
I've lost everything.

482
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,782
My wife, my family...

483
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:16,823
(sobbing)

484
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,615
You didn't lose me, Dad.

485
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,409
(chuckles) Lisa?

486
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,952
You can never lose me.

487
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,445
We share the same blood,

488
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,077
the same mixed feelings
towards Bart,

489
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,915
and you know I'll need support
in my teenage war with Mom.

490
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,752
(sobbing)
Oh, Lisa.

491
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,088
(both laughing)

492
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,633
Oh, Dad.

493
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,086
Dad!

494
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,506
-Aw, sweetie...
-Nothing could ever come between us.

495
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,684
...we'll be together forever.

496
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,262
ROGER:
Lisa, where are you, dear?

497
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,347
I thought we'd get in
a game of chess

498
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,853
before we go pony shopping.

499
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,604
Gotta go.

500
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,806
Lisa!

501
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,306
I'll Skype you at Christmas!

502
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,857
(echoing)
No...!

503
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,451
(Homer snoring)

504
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,620
Huh, so it was all <i>my</i> dream.

505
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,449
I better find out
what this all means.

506
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,615
It means,
like all married women,

507
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,714
sometimes you're sick
of your husband,

508
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,289
but sometimes you're afraid
of losing him.

509
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,795
And like all married men,
I didn't hear that first thing,

510
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,549
and I'm overconfident
of the second.

511
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,092
So what do we do?

512
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:21,295
I need some kind of guidance
to take away from all of this.

513
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,966
Put your finger on it
so I can tie it in a bow.

514
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,306
Please?

515
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,020
Well, one thing
we therapists can give

516
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,310
is concise, simple solutions,

517
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,734
and yours is...

518
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,734
Hannah, what does that one mean?

519
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,735
It means don't get drunk in Brooklyn.
