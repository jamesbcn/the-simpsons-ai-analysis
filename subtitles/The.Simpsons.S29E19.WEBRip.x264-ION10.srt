1
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:15,883
Worth it.

2
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,519
- Totally worth it.
- Again!

3
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:26,594
Dinnertime!

4
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,896
Dad, are you gonna
watch the solar eclipse?

5
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:31,399
Sorry, but this is
pork chop night.

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,742
Way to go, God!

7
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:49,383
Aah! My eyes!

8
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:51,419
I told you to use
the cardboard box!

9
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:54,122
I thought you meant
for standing on.

10
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:01,695
Marge, you gonna eat
that piece of burnt gristle?

11
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,564
- No.
- Whoo-hoo!

12
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,433
Homer!

13
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:08,035
Did you pour fry pan grease
into the milk carton?

14
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,404
- Yes, but it's not for...
- Just a splash for my coffee.

15
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:13,441
I wanted to watch
the eclipse with you.

16
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:15,576
I can only imagine
what you've got planned

17
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,411
for date night tomorrow.

18
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:20,381
Date night?!
Marge, if we're still dating,

19
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,883
why in the world
do we have these kids?

20
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,000
What?

21
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,986
Hey!

22
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,956
You need to make me feel
you're as smitten with me

23
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,758
as you were when we met.

24
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,261
Marge, darling,
you mean as much to me

25
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:34,962
as the sun and the moon.

26
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:37,765
There was an eclipse of the sun
by the moon,

27
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:39,933
and you didn't even
walk outside.

28
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,403
Come on, Marge,
you can't be that mad.

29
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:48,942
Marge wants a date night
this Saturday.

30
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:50,478
You think you've got problems?

31
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:53,347
I'm really not liking
this new bar mix.

32
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,285
This Saturday? Is she crazy?

33
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,520
That's when we spray nitrous
in the ant farm

34
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:00,954
and watch 'em go nuts.

35
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:02,690
Yeah, here's a taste.

36
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,460
Stupid ants.

37
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:08,696
Maybe I could have
a date night here.

38
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,464
Sure. I'll make it nice.

39
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:12,700
Take the paint cans
out of the ladies' room,

40
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,303
just like
the Waldorf Hysteria there.

41
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:18,306
I don't know what to do.
I want it to be perfect.

42
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:21,542
I've spent so long ignoring
how she thinks and feels.

43
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,777
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's a real crotch-22 there.

44
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,447
You know, Moe, a lot
of what you think you're saying,

45
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,848
you're not really saying.

46
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,850
Well, I got to admit,
I've been doing

47
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,453
a little of this nitrous myself.

48
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,025
Stupid ants.

49
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:47,368
<i>My funny valentine</i>

50
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:51,572
<i>Sweet comic valentine</i>

51
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:58,178
<i>You make me smile</i>

52
00:02:58,212 --> 00:03:00,848
<i>With my heart</i>

53
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,721
<i>Your looks are laughable</i>

54
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:11,058
You didn't have to do that.

55
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,761
That and much, much more.

56
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:21,402
Corkage fee.

57
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:22,736
$30 dollars?

58
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,605
Corkage is the sum we charge

59
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,540
for opening the wine
you bring, sir.

60
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:29,343
30 bucks to open a box?!

61
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,612
I mean, nothing's too good
for this lady.

62
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:34,582
- Play the violin.
- I am just a waiter, sir.

63
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:37,117
I said play the violin.

64
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:58,606
After dinner drinks.

65
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,141
I feel like
Mrs. Remington Steele.

66
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:06,079
<i>Con te partiro</i>

67
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:09,317
<i>Paesi</i>

68
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,485
<i>Che non ho mai...</i>

69
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,662
I want you.
I want you!

70
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,964
And I want you. Only you.

71
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:33,974
What the...?

72
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:43,351
Sweetie, I think
you'd better see who it is.

73
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,654
Homer, I know it's late

74
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,789
and you've got your
Keep Out, Flanders sign up,

75
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:51,759
but, I'm sorry, I...

76
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,694
I'm feeling mighty low, sir.

77
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,830
- Who is it, Homie?
- It's stupid no one.

78
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:58,866
Flanders? What's wrong?

79
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,034
Marge, it's date night!

80
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,936
That's a made-up thing.

81
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:07,174
Lukewarm water.
If I close my eyes,

82
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:08,942
I can pretend
I'm at the dentist.

83
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:12,380
Afterwards, I'll grab
some Flintstone vitamins

84
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,181
and try to knock myself out.

85
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:15,783
Half a Bamm-Bamm should do it.

86
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,217
Ned, what happened?

87
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,952
I'm out of work.

88
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,589
The Leftorium is no-morium.

89
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:25,158
Hey, Ned.
I can't hack it anymore.

90
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,127
You want to buy
my side of the kiosk?

91
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,463
I'll get all the people
coming out of Sears!

92
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:32,199
But I got squat.

93
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,970
People are getting all
their southpaw sundries online.

94
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,507
All I was getting were
right-handed college students

95
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,308
who wanted to experiment.

96
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,810
Don't worry, Ned.

97
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,646
Homer will tell you
how to get a job at the plant.

98
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,581
- I will?
- Yes, you will.

99
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:50,418
- Because it's date night.
- You said that wasn't a thing.

100
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:53,487
- Let's not fight on date night.
- Oh, all right.

101
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:55,489
Call the plant and ask
for Human Resources.

102
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:57,324
Oh, thank you.

103
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,027
And as a reward,
you get my famous cocoa.

104
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,936
Now, I assume the two of you
will want a cup?

105
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,371
Make my next one a double.

106
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:20,180
I cannot be your head
of Human Resources

107
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,682
one more second, okay?

108
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,717
With the verbal abuse
and the physical abuse,

109
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:25,285
and the lying under oath.

110
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,788
And especially this!

111
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:30,424
Would you like to be
the new head of Human Resources?

112
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,026
To quote my pet turtle,
shell yes!

113
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,528
Not so fast.

114
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:36,930
You may have to give me blood
from time to time.

115
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:39,199
Yes, sir.
My blood's like my attitude.

116
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,435
- B-positive.
- Excellent.

117
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:43,604
Isn't this great?
We're carpooling to work.

118
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,773
So I can see you
in the morning, at work,

119
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,775
in the evening,
and in my dreams,

120
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:50,043
thanking you
for saving my life.

121
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,079
Look, Ned,
we're just driving together.

122
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,548
I don't want any iddlies,
diddlies,

123
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,984
neighborinos
or oopsy-doopsies.

124
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,419
- Okily-dokily.
- Here's another suggestion.

125
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,321
No talk, just music.

126
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,991
Oh, sure. That's why I brought
this CD of Christian favorites,

127
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,993
Magical Ministry Tour.

128
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:11,264
<i>Pray, pray, heart and soul</i>

129
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,734
<i>Stick another dime
in the poor box, baby</i>

130
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,402
Maybe we should talk.

131
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,770
Well, of course, my friend.

132
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,438
- Want to talk about Jesus?
- No.

133
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:20,574
- Want to talk about Ecclesiastes?
- No.

134
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,843
Want to talk about baby Jesus?

135
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,012
<i>Pray, pray, heart and soul</i>

136
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,581
<i>Stick another dime
and I'll pray with thee</i>

137
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:29,617
Let's crank it up to six.

138
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,419
You'll notice on your paycheck,

139
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,989
we've adjusted for desk rental
and electrical power usage.

140
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:38,158
Isn't this a power plant?

141
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,094
As defined by the IRS,
we are a religion.

142
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:44,532
And that is the last question
you'll ask of me.

143
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:49,336
I will break you in one day.

144
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,371
Now we're gonna do
a little role-playing

145
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,840
with Smitty and Jacqueline.

146
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,642
Smitty, pretend
you're greeting her.

147
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,143
Have a good one.

148
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:59,212
Okay, stop right there.
A good one, what?

149
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,649
An unspecified object
is the devil's wordplay,

150
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:04,217
so I say, come and go
with a hidely-ho!

151
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,819
What a wuss.

152
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:07,387
I can hear you.

153
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,523
Did you help this wuss
get this job?

154
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:11,458
I just told him who to call.

155
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,460
And you didn't put in
a good word?

156
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,228
- No.
- You idiot.

157
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:17,631
A recommendation from you
would've sunk him for sure.

158
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:19,867
Okay, what happens
if I touch her?

159
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,334
Go ahead.

160
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,571
Hey, good work today.

161
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,438
This hardly seems fair!

162
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,010
Your behavior is obnoxious
and offensive.

163
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,713
You'll be working for me
in a different capacity.

164
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:40,654
- What are you doing, Lisa?
- Making an art project.

165
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:43,557
- You color very neatly.
- Thank you.

166
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:45,325
Pride's a sin.

167
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,361
So is snitching to God, Rod.

168
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:50,898
I'm Todd. I think.

169
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:56,770
Homer. Homer.

170
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:58,706
Hey, hey!

171
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,107
Homer, you were
sleeping at work.

172
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,742
I had to mop up your drool.

173
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,777
Leave me alone.

174
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,383
To beef up team spirit,
I thought I'd form

175
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,052
a little prayer circle
at lunch.

176
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:14,254
If you pray at lunch,

177
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,624
aren't you interrupting
God's lunch?

178
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:20,560
Finally,
someone thinks about God.

179
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:28,401
Todd, do you have
anything else you can do?

180
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:31,772
- Can I pray for you?
- If you do it silently.

181
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,607
Dear Lord, let Lisa avoid

182
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:35,575
the cleansing fire foretold by

183
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:38,578
the Council of Nicaea
before they got leprosy!

184
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:41,615
- That's not silently!
- You have such great hearing.

185
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,884
I miss Milhouse.

186
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,453
I knew if I switched
from white to dark socks,

187
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:49,056
things would start happening.

188
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,558
You wanted to see me?

189
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,926
I happen to know

190
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,762
your father didn't die.

191
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:57,765
Look, Ned, you have to learn
the way things work around here.

192
00:09:57,798 --> 00:10:00,634
People cut corners.
You have to let things slide.

193
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,939
Let me repeat.

194
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:08,108
Sorry, Homer,
I can't cut you any slack.

195
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,844
I owe it to you to help you
achieve your potential.

196
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:13,280
Maybe you could help get me
another job at the plant.

197
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:16,850
One where you don't have to
show up, like safety inspector.

198
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:18,786
But you are
the safety inspector.

199
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,620
Then I should really
return these things

200
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,622
that have fallen down my back.

201
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:29,029
They look like gummy worms,
but they're not.

202
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:33,300
I can't take it.
I can't take it!

203
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,502
Why can't he be like
our neighbor on the other side,

204
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:37,671
who we never see?

205
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:39,206
What's the matter, Homie?

206
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,975
Oh, no. No. No.

207
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,387
Oh, Lord, it's Homer Simpson.

208
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:56,656
I forget. Are you seven hours
ahead or behind?

209
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,626
Whatever. I really need
your help with Flanders.

210
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,795
Could you please get him fired?

211
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,864
I feel you. Thanks.

212
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,066
Oh, I reached him.

213
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,735
So, looking through the records,

214
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:11,304
I discovered this company has
never given anything to charity.

215
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:12,973
In fact, it looks as if

216
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,575
we've actually taken money
from charities.

217
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,244
Ned, would you mind

218
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,579
if I brought a few associates
into this meeting?

219
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,014
Well, no.

220
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:23,984
- You're fired!
- Nice boy, nice boy!

221
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,485
You're welcome
to keep any radiation

222
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,054
that seeped into your bones.

223
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,089
Speaking of charity,
call the orphanage, Smithers.

224
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,091
We have some leaks in our pipes

225
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:32,926
and need tiny hands
to plug them.

226
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,362
They said they wouldn't
send you any children, sir.

227
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,064
They have to say that.

228
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,936
I want to thank you, Homer.
You've been a true blue friend.

229
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,105
Can we talk about something fun?

230
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,374
I now weigh more than Fat Elvis.

231
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,943
Well, I know
I got one advantage you don't.

232
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:52,279
I got Homer Simpson
in my corner.

233
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,948
Ned,
I have a confession to make.

234
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,950
Now don't go
turning Catholic on me.

235
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:59,119
I can't.
I don't fit in those booths.

236
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,954
Don't worry about me.

237
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:03,791
I'm sure there's a job out there
for a Bob Jones University grad

238
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,793
who majored in teaching
and casting out demons

239
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,494
and who speaks fluent Aramaic.

240
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:14,334
Wish Mr. Burns
didn't send these home with you.

241
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,571
A word to the wise,
don't be cocky.

242
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:21,141
Don't say you can lifeguard
if you can't swim.

243
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,610
It'll come up, believe me.

244
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,716
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

245
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,219
Make sure you keep at least
five Bibles between you.

246
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,787
Oh, don't got crazy,
Patrick Swayze.

247
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,488
Time to put Baby in the corner.

248
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,931
You can't pose for your
cover photo like that.

249
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,801
Much better.

250
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:02,449
Ned, would you like
to say grace?

251
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,417
Heavenly Father,

252
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,587
thank you for the blessing
of being tested, losing my wife,

253
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,423
losing my second wife,
losing four jobs,

254
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,760
and losing $23
at blackjack to Bart.

255
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,930
23 chips, so $2,300.

256
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:20,100
- I'll finish grace at home.
- Can you do that?

257
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,335
Yes, I can do that!

258
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:26,106
Oh, God, now the apologies
are gonna start.

259
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,441
I apologize
for my tone of voice,

260
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,343
and for the things I said.

261
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:32,212
And now, as penance,

262
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,814
I will get that skunk
out of your birdhouse.

263
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,152
I don't care what you say, Marge.
We got to help him!

264
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,653
I want to help him.

265
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:43,323
Good, good.
The ice queen begins to thaw.

266
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:46,493
Oh, Lord, give me a sign
you're still with me.

267
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,233
Poor Ned.

268
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,802
It really helps
to eat your feelings.

269
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,805
I've got it!
I know what job Ned can do!

270
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,375
Well, go tell him.
He goes to bed in five minutes.

271
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:05,812
Ned, Ned!
You should be what Jesus was!

272
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,214
- A carpenter?
- No.

273
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:08,681
- Fisherman?
- No.

274
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,050
- Foot washer?
- No.

275
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,818
- Wine creator?
- No.

276
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,153
- Water walker?
- No.

277
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,521
- Superstar?
- No.

278
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:17,357
- Dashboard ornament?
- No! A teacher.

279
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,192
I think you should be a teacher.

280
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:20,827
Like Jesus.

281
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,795
Lord, should I do it?

282
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,699
And you shall receive it.

283
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,671
He's looking right at us,
and he's not doing a thing!

284
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,741
Duffman hates Duffmankind!

285
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,476
Oh, yeah!

286
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,417
<i>Up in the morning
and out to school</i>

287
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:47,887
<i>The teacher is teaching
the golden rule</i>

288
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:50,924
<i>American history
and practical math</i>

289
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,926
<i>You studying hard...</i>

290
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,263
I promised I wouldn't cry
on his first day of school.

291
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:59,099
Let's play the frozen game.

292
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,941
So, rub-a-dub-dub,
30 kids and their sub.

293
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:09,809
Let's be friends, shall we?

294
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,945
Teacher, teacher, you must quit.

295
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:14,281
You can't teach us math or lit.

296
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,749
There's no mercy in the bunch.

297
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,419
We will make you leave by lunch.

298
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,989
Martin Prince?
Were you in on that poem?

299
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:24,224
Oh, they paid me.
A gig's a gig.

300
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,892
Well, sir, I'm not scared off.

301
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,927
I got two little wild things
at home.

302
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:33,666
Now, who can name
the state capitals?

303
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,103
A dingus.

304
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:39,406
Well, in that case, I'm
the biggest dingus in the world.

305
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,944
Okay, then,
let's give Mr. Flanders

306
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:47,147
a room 4F salute.

307
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:04,297
Simpson, take the kill shot.

308
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,699
Why me?

309
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:09,802
- Prove your loyalty.
- My loyalty to what?

310
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,871
To peer pressure.

311
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,145
Bart Simpson, I know you...

312
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,547
we've been fishing together,
we've gone to church together...

313
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,950
and if you can fire that spit
wad after our long relationship,

314
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,985
I don't deserve to be a teacher.

315
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,393
Last lesson, kids.

316
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:36,863
F is for foolish
and failure and Flanders.

317
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,398
You win.

318
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:43,970
Yes?

319
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,173
Look, what is your deal?
Do you like me?

320
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:47,974
Do you want to be like me?

321
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,377
Lisa, I have something
to show you.

322
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,645
- What?
- I made you a little house.

323
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,516
There's me praying.
There's you at the computer.

324
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,718
I made you a saxophone
out of dried macaroni,

325
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,554
and the crackers on the roof,
they're solar panels.

326
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:03,523
Todd, I had you all wrong.

327
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,158
You're a wonderful kid,

328
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,527
and I'm happy
to call you my pal.

329
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,663
So glad I have a friend.
I'm really sick of my brother.

330
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,365
Okay, that's enough.

331
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,570
What's the matter, Homer?

332
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:20,373
I think I ruined Flanders' life.

333
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:21,608
Join the club.

334
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,210
What are you doing here?

335
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:26,079
I come here for a G&T,
gumball and talk.

336
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:29,916
Here you go, pal.

337
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,188
Listen, you've got
to apologize to Flanders.

338
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,090
Why don't you apologize
to Flanders?

339
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:39,592
You're the one who prayed
for him to get fired.

340
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:42,395
What? He should apologize to me,
because he...

341
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:45,532
well, he...
he makes me feel so damn guilty!

342
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,900
All right, I'll apologize too.

343
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,870
What's she doing here?

344
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,072
Hello.
She's my designated driver.

345
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,884
Hey, fellas.
What brings you here?

346
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,386
We came to say we're sorry,

347
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,555
and we want you
to go back to teaching.

348
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,223
Oh, with all I've been through,

349
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:13,059
I've never questioned my faith
until now.

350
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,562
You spit-wadded
my moustache, boy.

351
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,764
I think you could be
a great teacher.

352
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:19,766
Almost as good as her.

353
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,903
Thank you, son.

354
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,242
Remember, if you can
teach one kid one thing,

355
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,411
then today will be a success.

356
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,413
She never gave up.

357
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,482
- Neither will I.
- Great.

358
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:37,650
Now, this counts
as a parent-teacher conference

359
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:39,085
and a Christmas concert.

360
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,487
Well, that's all well and good,

361
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,822
but I got to get those kids
to respect me.

362
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,825
Do people respect God?
No, they fear him.

363
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:49,762
It's never personal,
just business.

364
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,167
Just leave everything to me.

365
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,440
Listen up, children.
If you push hard enough

366
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,476
on the pudding skin, there's
a tough cup of vanilla beneath.

367
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,546
- Now take your seats.
- How you gonna make us?

368
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,653
I won't.
The good Lord will.

369
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:23,530
The scariest thing is
we don't have a class skeleton!

370
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:28,000
Truly, God is the biggest bully
of them all.

371
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,536
Amen.

372
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,575
Now, Nelson,
I'm not gonna ask you to stand

373
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,310
and read me a list
of state capitals,

374
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,812
but the good Lord
might be pleased.

375
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:43,816
Albany, Annapolis, Atlanta,
Augusta, Austin, Baton Rouge...

376
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:47,420
Does the Lord hear
the bell up there?

377
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:49,155
Yes, son, he does.

378
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,028
Thank you, Bart.
I knew, deep within you,

379
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,531
there was a good boy,
and I respectfully request

380
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:01,000
that those be
the last two pranks you pull.

381
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,035
You know it, man.

382
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,510
Wow, they're quiet.

383
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,112
I'm reaching them.
Edna was right.

384
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,181
Does that
cute school nurse

385
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,049
know that I'm alive?

386
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,253
Because last time I left
her office, I was legally dead.

387
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:23,290
I have to beat Terri
to a training bra.

388
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:25,625
I wonder how much
I can sell Maggie for.

389
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:28,628
I'm starting to think this
wheel doesn't go anywhere.
