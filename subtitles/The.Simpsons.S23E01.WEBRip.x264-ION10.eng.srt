1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,421
Good evening.

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:05,012
Tonight, we reveal to you
the fate of Nedna.

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,918
I have devoted my summer
to a more meaningful task:

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,928
savaging
<i>Mr. Popper's Penguins</i> online.

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,051
Anyway, the answer
to Ned and Edna

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,468
is carefully hidden
in tonight's episode,

7
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,347
like a bread crumb
lodged inside my stomach crease.

8
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,635
Enjoy.

10
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,315

{\an8}While I'm here,
I might as well pre-punch out.

35
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,054
{\an8}Hmm, we've had
a lot of bills lately.

36
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,595
{\an8}Better put in some overtime.

37
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,929
{\an8}(chuckles)

38
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,176
{\an8}(humming)

39
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,727
{\an8}Larry, my man!

40
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,192
{\an8}Hey, you're not Larry.

41
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,441
{\an8}How come you're
not Larry?

42
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,573
{\an8}I wouldn't know, sir.

43
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,530
{\an8}Uh, listen,
if you could indulge me,

44
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,201
{\an8}Larry and I fist-bump
every morning.

45
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,990
{\an8}Like that.
The warmth of human contact

46
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,825
{\an8}with a manly whiff of violence.

47
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,990
{\an8}Eh?

48
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,908
{\an8}Not interested.

49
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,576
{\an8}Wha...?!
Sheesh!

50
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,326
{\an8}Hey, what's with that
new security guard?

51
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,837
{\an8}He's acting all aloof.

52
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,759
{\an8}Uh, by the way, that's my
word of the day: "he's."

53
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,669
{\an8}Maybe I was
a little hard on him,

54
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,967
{\an8}expecting him to be Larry
right away.

55
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,511
{\an8}By the way, where is Larry?

56
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,184
{\an8}-Crazy house.
-Violent ward.

57
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,013
{\an8}Good ol' Larry.

58
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:20,928
{\an8}(humming)

59
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,135
{\an8}Say... Wayne,

60
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,476
{\an8}I couldn't help but notice

61
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,351
{\an8}that your breath doesn't
smell like alcohol.

62
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,357
{\an8}You want to go grab
a beer after work?

63
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,859
{\an8}I prefer not to have social
interaction with coworkers.

64
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,572
{\an8}It, um, hasn't worked out for me
in the past.

65
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,823
{\an8}Well, maybe he just
doesn't like fist-bumping.

66
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,526
{\an8}Hey, Wayne.

67
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:43,706
{\an8}As God as my witness,
this fist will be bumped!

68
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,958
{\an8}Put that fool thing down.

69

<i>ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i>We now return to </i>Master Chef:

70
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,999
Extreme Snack Edition.

71
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,800
{\an8}Marge, your ratio of peanut butter
to cracker was spot on.

72
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,094
{\an8}And I loved the addition
of the thin slice of apple.

73
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,848
{\an8}This was a great
plate of food.

74
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:00,849
{\an8}Thank you.

75
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,730
{\an8}This is my third favorite
reality cooking show.

76
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,688
{\an8}For your prize, you have won
a brand-new kitchen,

77
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:07,979
{\an8}which I will now become.

{\an8}Ow! Ow! Ow!

80
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,903
{\an8}I miss my soul patch.

Oh.

82
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,200
{\an8}Kids, enjoy your
extreme snack.

83
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,253
{\an8}Wait, this tastes different.

84
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,249
{\an8}I put a slice of apple in it.

85
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,331
{\an8}Gross.

86
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,075
{\an8}You know
I hate surprises.

87
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,077
{\an8}You tricked us.

88
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,958

{\an8}Did you have
a hard day, too?

91
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,010
{\an8}Ah, a guy at work
seems not to like me.

92
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,144
{\an8}I guess it's not much

93
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,181
{\an8}when you look at real problems
in the world,

94
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:46,104
{\an8}like Major League umpires

{\an8}It's big to you.

a "get well" pork chop?

{\an8}Charlie, want to grab a beer?

101
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,530
{\an8}No, I was tipsy last night
when a telephone survey called,

102
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,407
{\an8}so I told them
to call back tonight

103
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,124
{\an8}for more accurate answers.

104
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,794
Oh. Okay.

105
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,042
(thunder rumbling softly)

106
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,958
(gasps)
Wayne!

107
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,713
Want a ride?

108
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,128
I can walk.

109
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,296

111
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,555
All right, Homer, you win.

112
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,890
You know, I just got a little chill
when you said my name.

113
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,057
(quietly)
Every town I go to,

114
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,904
I run into some guy
just like this.

115
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,691
Look, I'm not
weird or anything,

116
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,364
I just like to feel like
I'm friends with everybody.

117
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,823
(sighs)
Homer, you're a nice guy.

118
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,204
I'll have one beer
with you.

119
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,531
After that, we will have

120
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,365
a courteous professional
relationship, and that's it.

121
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,791
No Secret Santa,
we're not trading lunches...

122
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,250
-Oh!
-and I don't want you

123
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,290
calling me at home and saying
"Turn on channel six."

124
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,384
But what if the weather girl...

125
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,878
I don't care!

126
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,384
Wow, I can't believe
Homer bagged the tiger.

127
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,966
Excuse me, I need to use the...

00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:02,971

Oh, my God.

00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:07,178
We're completing
each other's...

131
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,765
Completing each other's...

132
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:14,771
sen... ten... ces...

133
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,704
Totally surprising entrance!

(cocks gun)

135
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,992
Hand over your
cash and jewelry.

136
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:25,994
Pronto.

137
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,695
(groans)

138
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,745
Hmm. Hmm.

139
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,831
Okay, now,
don't want no trouble.

140
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,086
Let me just get my cash
out of my cash drawer here.

141
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,050
Just, uh, lining up all
the presidents, nice and neat.

142
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,842
Ain't trying to be no hero.

143
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:43,795
(chuckles)

144
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,755
Uh...
(chuckles)

145
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,845
Uh, here you go.

146
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,309
Thanks for the upgrade.

147
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,349
Ha-ha!

148
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,151
(grunts)

149
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,478
-Wayne?
-Stand back, Homer!

150
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,154
I know what I'm doing.

151
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,732
Well, we all know
what we're doing.

152
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,737
The question is, is it an appropriate
reaction to the situation?

153
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,530
(sighs)
Drunks are so boring.

154
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,325
-(gasps)
-(gunshot)

155
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,746
(screams)
My fresco!

156
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,248
That's coming out
of your stealings!

157
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,751
(grunts)

158
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,042
(yells)

159
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,625
(grunts)

160
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,340
Wayne, maybe it's the
me-being-still-alive talking,

161
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,842
but I think you're awesome.

162
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:27,465
I'm just a guy who saw what
needed to be done and did it.

163
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:31,063
Oh, speaking of which,
let's get these eggs back in a jar.

164
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,810
(humming)

165
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,734
(cocks gun)

166
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,990
Wow, that's the farthest
that one of my eggs

167
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,123
ever made it down
someone's throat.

168
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,865
It's great to have
a home-cooked meal.

169
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,536
Well, if anyone
saves my Homie's life,

170
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,915
they get a free meal.

171
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,171
Which actually comes up
about once a week.

172
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,215
So, Wayne,
how'd you learn

173
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,928
all those cool
self-defense moves?

174
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,048
I had training.
Special training.

175
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,506
The kind they're not allowed
to give anymore.

176
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,105
(grunts)

177
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,229
(screams)

178
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,736
(choking)

179
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,081
(jabbering, grunts)

180
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,010
(quacking laugh)

181
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,592
(grunting)

182
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,427
(yelling)

183
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,771
(roaring)

184
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,019
(straining)

185
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,481
Sorry.
I have to go.

186
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,145
Oh, come on,
stay for dessert!

187
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,363
(straining)

188
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,235
(sighs)

189
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,537
Hey, Simpson, you want to hear
about the big change in my life?

190
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,829
Sure, why not.

191
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,252
I started drinking
orange juice with pulp.

192
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,371
I asked the Reverend,
and he said it was okay.

193
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,958
Then he hung
right up on me.

194
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,503
That man is cranky
at 3:00 in the morning.

195
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,802
And here he is,
this week's Noble Nobody.

196
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,385
What the... (bleep)

197
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,560
<i>A quiet, unassuming</i>
<i>security guard</i>

198
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,639
<i>who foiled a robbery</i>
<i>at a local tavern,</i>

199
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,734

204
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,969
Please, sir,
just let me do my job.

205
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,129
Pish tush.

206
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,967
Wayne, as a reward for
your valiant fisticuffery,

207
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,303
I hereby award you

208
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,218
the Springfield Nuclear Plant
Silver Safety Hat.

209
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,598
-(fanfare plays)
-(horses neigh)

210
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,268
(chuckles maniacally)

211
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,068
Thanks to you, Wayne,

212
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,741
we did not lose the
visible half of the moon.

213
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,071
Just doing my job, sir.

214
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,115
All too well.

215
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,578
I'm afraid that protocol demands

216
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,578
that I totally
erase your memory.

217
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,331
(grunting)

218
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,879
(crackling)

219
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,302
(grunting)

220
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,050
Die, you fascist bastard!

221
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,393
Mother, is that you?

222
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,638
Wayne, stop!
That's Mr. Burns!

223
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,311
(gasping)

224
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,980
Ooh.

225
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,638
I expect insolence,
but rank insolence?

226
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,938
-Off with his job!
-(sighs)

227
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,062
Damn it.

228
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,484
Why don't you
come stay with us

229
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,487
till you can get
back on your feet?

230
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,319
Really? Are you sure?

231
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,244
Of course.

232
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,822
I mean, how long
could it be?

233
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:16,946
I don't know.

234
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,123
I've got no job, no references,
can't afford my apartment.

235
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,912
It's best to concentrate
on what you do have.

236
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,747
I have reoccurring flashbacks
to a nightmarish past.

237
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,423
That's funny, because I have

238
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,711
reoccurring flash-forwards
to a nightmarish future.

239
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,343
(chanting)
Unfair! Unfair!

240
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,585
That robot took our jobs!

241
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,258
He said it.

242
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,177
Or, uh, maybe it was him.

243
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,652
Man, this robot really gets me.

244
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,774
My nightmares are real.

245
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:52,686
Your voice is so gravelly,
just like Lauren Bacall's.

246
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,788
If you don't listen to me,
Senator,

247
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,159
there's not going to be
a Fourth of July!

248
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:07,036
WAYNE: Don't you get it?
He used the governor's eyeball

249
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,884
for the retinal scan!

250
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,129
That's ten members
of the electoral college

251
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,342
dead in one day!

252
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,261
If you don't give me
those launch codes,

253
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,470
you'll never be able to make
the "okay" sign again.

254
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,470
I know the map
is inside your eyelids,

255
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,352
and I will turn them
inside out if I have to!

256
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,020
If you move that little top hat
to St. James Place,

257
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,810
we'll all be blown
to kingdom come!

258
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,023
Bring me every fish
in that aquarium!

259
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,984
One of them is lying!

260
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,234
(relieved sigh)

261
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,435
I'm sorry I have
so many nightmares.

262
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,066
I've done
unspeakable things,

263
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,992
from Buenos Aires
to the Ukraine.

264
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,571
Well, what brought you
to Springfield?

265
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,486
Was it our Frito-Lay
distribution center?

266
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,905
I needed somewhere to lie low.

267
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,253
Your town appears
on no maps or charts.

268
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,459
Yeah, they couldn't find
a Google map photo

269
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,920
without me naked
or urinating.

270
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,419
And when there was
a mapmaker's convention here,

271
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,422
they all got
Lou Gehrig's disease.

272
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,014
Not the one you're
thinking of--

273
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,629
there's another one.

274
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,966
So, Lisa, if you press
on Bart's elbow,

275
00:11:59,051 --> 00:11:59,971
-here,
-Ow!

276
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,892
he'll tell you
anything you want to know.

277
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,641
I admit it!
I let Milhouse

278
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,773
lie down in your bed!

279
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,019
Kids, can I talk
to Wayne alone a minute?

280
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,691
Remember everything
they say,

281
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,349
and tell us
later in rattle code.

282
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,018
-(rattling)
-What do you mean, no?

283
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,146
(grunts)

284
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,322
I don't know if you
should teach our children

285
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,701
advanced interrogation
techniques.

286
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:18,778
I'm sorry, Marge.

287
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,453
Sometimes I forget where I am.

288
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,411
Apology accepted.

289
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,791
Now, could you teach me
a couple little driving tricks?

290
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,665
(laughs)

291
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,335
We'll see who gets their pick

292
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,303
of pizza pockets!

293
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,012
Give us your lunch money!

294
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,925
(grunting in pain)

295
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,644
(bones crack, grunts)

296
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,314
What gives, man?
Where'd you learn that stuff?

297
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,563
If I told you,
I'd have to kill you.

298
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,225
-Can I tell you?
-No! I won't listen!

299
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,935
We can't keep serving
the same thing every day.

300
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,896
These kids have mashed potatoes
coming out of their ears.

301
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,987

-Point taken.

(music continues)

308
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,220
I can't live in the
real world anymore.

309
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,103
This is the real world?

310
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,270
Hallelujah!
I'm still alive!

311
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,269
Ha-ha! And I'll appreciate
every moment!

312
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,152
Except the ones that aren't
as good as they used to be.

313
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,730
Which is all of them.

314
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,395
Oh, someone kill me.

00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,043
would he attempt
to rescue that friend?

352
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:17,961
Well, I suppose if the friend
was being horribly tortured...

353
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,092
H-Hey, wha? Wha? Wha?

354
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,049

00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,181
This just in:
a local man has been kidnapped

there aren't newspapers anymore?

365
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:51,283
{\an8}Perhaps we will be living in a world
where there'll be no need to kidnap.

366
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,037
{\an8}Oh, well, way to make <i>me</i>

Homer is implanted with several
highly powerful tracking chips.

387
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,694

You ever eat

What they call a steak
is barely a hamburger.

Now, Homer...
there's one more thing before I go.

419
