51
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,685

to hook me up illegally

cable before.

we can afford it?

Nothing a month.

89
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,731

swing that.

He's got his hi-fi,
his boob tube,

126

Now, I don't want you
to get frightened,

130
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,638
but it's my responsibility

131
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,389
Today's topic
will be Hell.

-(all exclaiming)
-BART: All right.

133
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,771
I've sat through mercy and
I've sat through forgiveness.

134
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,560
Finally, we get to
the good stuff.

135
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,404
Oh, Hell is
a terrible place.

136
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,399
Maggots are your sheet,
worms your blanket.

137
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,032
There's a lake of fire
burning with sulfur.

138
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,530
You'll be tormented
day and night forever and ever.

139
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,322
As a matter of fact,
If you actually saw hell,

140
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,567
you'd be so frightened
you would die.

141
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,868
(gasps)

142
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,871
-Oh, Miss Albright?
-Yes, Bart?

143
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,623
Wouldn't you eventually
get used to it,

144
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:54,714
like in a hot tub?

145
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,869
No.
Yes, Bart.

146
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,458
Are there pirates in hell?

147
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,253
Yes, thousands of them.

148
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,916
Ooh-ooh, baby.

149
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,674
So what you're saying is,

150
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,506
there's a down side
to the afterlife.

151
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,391
How does one steer clear of
this abode of the damned?

152
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,309
By obeying
The Ten Commandments.

153
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,719
Ten simple rules

154
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,677
that are easy
to live by.

155
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,693
(shuddering)

156
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,983
So, what did you children
learn about today?

157
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:23,897
-Hell.
-Bart!

158
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,695
Well that's what we learned about.

159
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,158
I sure as hell can't tell you
we learned about Hell

160
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,068
unless I say Hell, can I?

161
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,237
Well, the lad has a point.

162
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,664
-Hell, yes.
-Bart!

163
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,372
(singsongy)
Hell, Hell, Hell, Hell,

164
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,333
Hell, Hell, Hell,
Hell, Hell--

165
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,793
Bart, you're no longer
in Sunday School.

166
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,174
Don't swear.

167
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,424
(door opens, closes)

168
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,803
(cat screeches)

169
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,590
Hey, anybody up for a little
so-called pay TV?

170
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,965
-(turns TV on)
-(both chuckle)

171
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,891
Dad, are you sure
this isn't stealing?

172
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,970
Read the pamphlet, honey.

173
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,305
<i>Hello, I'm Troy McClure.</i>

174

So, even if a man takes bread

that would be stealing?

304
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,555

Is your father
stealing bread?

308
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,659
Maybe. I don't watch him
every minute.

309
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,700
But what I am sure of is,
we're getting cable for free.

310
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,615
Well, I'm afraid that
is stealing, Lisa,

311
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,044

must do something. Hm.

312
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,423

father arrested?

313
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,340
Well, Lisa, on the surface,
that would appear to be

314
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,588
an ideal solution
to the problem,

315

-Hmm.

346
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,989
HOMER: There's something wrong
with that kid.

347
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,825
She's so moral.

348
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,660
Why can't she
be more like--

349
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,115
Well, not like Bart,

350
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,075
but there's gotta be
a happy medium.

351
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,995
Well, you know,

352
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,795
Bart was looking
at that racy movie today,

353
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,340
and Lisa's losing
a little respect for you.

354
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:48,505
Hmm. Maybe we should think
about unhooking the cable.

355
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,806
Unhook it?!
But I love cable.

356
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,100
Well, then maybe you
should pay for it.

357
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,813
D'oh! Look, look, Marge,
I can't afford it.

358
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,895
When I can afford
to pay for it, I will,

359
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,610
but I can't,
so I'm not going to.

360
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,570
Homer, I'm afraid that
cable has become

361
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,531
an evil presence in our home.

362
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,702
Marge, I never put my foot
down about anything--

363
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,872
-No.
-But I am severely tempted

364
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,121
to do it over this.

365
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,792
-Oh, Homer.
-Marge, I'm sorry.

366
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,251
-I think it's coming down.
-No, Homer--

367
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,002
It's coming down, my foot--
That's it, Marge!

368
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,093
It's coming down.
The cable stays.

369
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,749
The foot has spoken.

370
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:22,917
(loud thud)

371
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,931
-BOY: <i>Lemonade? Please.</i>
-Seen it.

372
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,680
-MAN: <i>Cleans and straightens your teeth. </i>
-Seen it.

373
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,933
<i>-♪♪ (rap)</i>
-Seen it.

374
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,024
<i>-I was poor like you--</i>
-Seen it.

375
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,188
Ugh, soccer.
Seen it.

376
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,438
-Hey, Simpson.
-What? Hey, how'd you get in here?

377
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,650
Well, your door wasn't locked
in any serious way.

378
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,232
I wonder if you'd be
interested in this car stereo?

379
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,908
A $500 value, but I'll let you
have it for 40 bucks.

380
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,488
Get out of my house! I don't
want to associate with criminals.

381
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,744
Well, maybe I'll go see
your neighbor.

382
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:52,905
He's not home.

383
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:53,913
Even better.

384
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,631
(locks clicking)

385
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,458
Are you sure
you want do this, Homer?

386
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,423
It doesn't
look friendly.

387
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,054
Marge, we can't be
too careful.

388
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,800
There are thieves everywhere,

389
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,392
and I'm not talking about
the small, forgivable stuff.

390
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,684
Come one, come all.

391
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,352
Top Hat Theater
is on the air.

392
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,182
The most beautiful women
in the world.

393
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,977
Just 50 cents.
I am your host, Bart Simpson.

394
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,272
You must be at least
eight years old to enter.

395
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,284
WOMAN: <i>And now,</i>
<i>the Top Hat Channel</i>

396
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,361

<i>"Broadcast Nudes."</i>

397
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,657
ALL: Ooh.

398
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,790
-Gross!
-Yet strangely compelling.

399
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,748
-HOMER: Huh?!
-It's a raid!

400
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,749
What the--
What are all these kids--

401
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,421
Hey! I know you.
Come back here!

402
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,718
Bart, you promised me you
wouldn't watch that trash.

403
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:48,918
Now go to your room!

404
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,758
Man, I wish I was an adult

405
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,433
so I could break the rules.

406
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,471
Oh, great.

407
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,474
(tires squeal)

408
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,136
-(cat screeches)
-Here.

409
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,444
I brought some imported
generic beer.

410
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,188
Oh, thank you, Barney.

411
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,980
How many people
are coming, Homer?

412
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,693
Just a select circle
of my friends.

413
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,034
Oh, hello, Mrs. Homer.

414
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,489
I brought an assortment
of jerkies.

415
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,149
Ooh, did you swipe
those from work?

416
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:13,817
Certainly not.
What has been implied here?

417
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,327
MAN: <i>Oh, no sir,</i>
<i>there is no love lost</i>

418
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,580
<i>between these two warriors.</i>

419
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,581
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>we almost had a scuffle</i>

420
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,333
<i>earlier today</i>
<i>at the weigh-in.</i>

421
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,035
<i>I understand you have</i>
<i>a special motivation</i>

422
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,286
<i>going into this bout.</i>

423
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,297
<i>Yeah. I wanna dedicate</i>
<i>this fight</i>

424
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,169
<i>to my manager Vinnie</i>
<i>who got me here,</i>

425

427
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,348
<i>Any response to that?</i>

428
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,060
<i>Yeth, I would altho like</i>
<i>to dedicate thith fight</i>

429
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,891
<i>to the memory of</i>
<i>his deceased manager.</i>

430
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,686
<i>-You can't do that.</i>
<i>-I can do whatever I want.</i>

431
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,400
<i>You dedicate the fight</i>
<i>to your manager, man!</i>

432
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,980
<i>This is just incorrigible.</i>

433
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,975
I just want to call
attention to the fact

434
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,567
that I'm not watching
this fight.

435
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,912
It's my form
of nonviolent protest.

436
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,028
(doorbell rings)

437
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,909
Hey, Homer.
I brought--

438
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,122
Ahh! Quick!
It's Moe!

439
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,753
I got to hide the mugs.

440
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,165
Well-- Will you--

441
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,511
Hey, go protest outside,
will you? Now!

442
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,934
Hey, Homer.
I brought you a mug.

443
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,799
Ooh!
Thank you, Moe.

444
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,506
I always wanted one of these.

445
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,846
Ahh!

446
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,392
Oh, Mr. Burns!

447
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,982
Bart, quick. Hide the stuff
I borrowed from work.

448
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,403
-Borrowed?
-All right, the stuff I stole from work.

449
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,192
Oh, okay.

450
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:38,485
Now, come on! Take all this
and this, put it in the closet.

451
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:41,075
-Will you quit staring at me like that?
-(doorbell rings)

452
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,496
Oh, hello, Simpson.

453
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,670
We were just
in the neighborhood

454
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,539
and thought we'd drop by.

455
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,376
Uh, hello, Mr. Burns.

456
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,461
Would you like
to watch the fight?

457
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,547
The fight? Well,
don't mind if I do.

458
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,553
Oh, Simpson, good news.
I brought some munchies.

459

463
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,856
-(screams)
-You Homer Simpson?

464
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,191
-Yeah.
-Word on the street

465
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,396
is that you have
an illegal cable hookup.

466
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,565
No. No, I--
It wasn't me.

467
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,414
It was my wife's--
my wife's idea.

468
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,409
-Yeah, yeah. (sobbing)
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

469
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,542
Hey, settle down,
big fella.

470
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,909
We're just-- Whoa! We're just
wondering if we could watch the fight.

471
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,828
Oh, sure, sure.
Be my guest.

472
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,626
Lisa, I brought you
some lemonade for your protest.

473
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,086
Thanks, Mom.

474
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,886
It doesn't seem
to be going very well.

475
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,469
Well, don't give up.
When you love somebody

476
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,345
you have to have faith
that in the end,

I've made a couple of

500

Number one,
I'm cutting the cable

501

as soon as the fight's over.

502
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,409
And number two,

503
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,582
I'm not very fond
