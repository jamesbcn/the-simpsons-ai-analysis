It's just a simulator.

53
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,066

67

how he caused the meltdown.

68
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,121
There wasn't any
nuclear material in the truck!

69
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,997
Very well.
It's time for your bribe.

70
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,423
Now, you can either have
the washer and dryer

71
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,962
where the lovely Smithers
is standing,

72
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,666
or you can trade it all in
for what's in this box.

73
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,218
The box.
The box!

74
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,181
Look, Burns,
this is a big problem.

75
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,141
You just can't throw money at it
and make it go away.

76
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,972
Gentlemen, I've decided

77
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,557
there will be
no investigation.

78
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,192
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll go away.

79
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,688
You're in big trouble, Burns.
Homer Simpson's job

80
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,151
requires college training
in nuclear physics.

81
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,862
Now, you get your man
up to speed,

82
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:55,943
or we'll be forced
to take legal action.

83
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,857
Is that so?

84
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,486
Well, I have the feeling
you'll be...

85
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,033
dropping the charges.

86
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,373
-Oh.
-The painters moved your desk, sir.

87
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,913

-Hello, Simpson.

90
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,382
My lawyers and I were in
the neighborhood

91
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,171
and thought we'd stop by.

92
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,505
Would you like to come in for
tea and marshmallow squares?

93
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,721
(murmuring)

94
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,222
Yes, he would.

95
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,223
So you want me
to go to college?

96
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,385
College?

97
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,683
-Ha! Barber or clown?
-Bart!

98
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,687
Remember, your job and
the future of your family

99
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,190
hinges on your
successful completion

100
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,232
of Nuclear Physics 101.

101
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,904
Oh, and one more thing.

102
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,244
You must find
the jade monkey

103
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,859
before the next full moon.

104
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,867
Actually, sir,
we found the jade monkey.

105
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,739
It was in
your glove compartment.

106
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,826
And the road maps
and ice scraper?

107
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,080
They were in there too, sir.

108
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,211
Excellent!

109
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,249
It's all
falling into place.

110
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,632
I think this is
a great opportunity.

111
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,960
You could learn so much.

112
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,134
Maybe you're right.

113
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,132
I did always want
to go to college.

114
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,974
But fate stood in the way.

115
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,967

{\an8}Dad, don't let these

-No.

128
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,082
-Son of Sniglet?
-No.

129
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,917
-Katherine Hepburn's "Me"?
-No!

130
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,672
Ohh! I suck!

131
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,764
It was the most I ever threw up,

132
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,800
and it changed my life forever.

133
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,724
You the man, Homer!

134
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:47,562
Thanks, boy.
Now for the crowning touch.

135
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,681
I don't know, Dad.

136
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,018
Don't you have
a better picture?

137
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,732
Relax. A photo
can't make any difference.

138
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,068
-He looks crazy.
-Agreed.

139
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,490
Reading his essay would
only waste valuable seconds.

Homie,
here are the responses

167
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,086
from the colleges
you applied to.

168
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,006
D'oh!

169
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,014
D'oh! D'oh!

170
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,096
Whoo-hoo! A flyer
for a hardware store!

171
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,772
-D'oh!
-Well, Pop, what are you gonna do?

172
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:19,942
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

173
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,783
-You don't know, do you?
-No, ma'am.

174
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,741
Don't worry, Simpson.

175
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,661

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,310
on Richard Nixon.

350
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,518
And here he is rolling
in his own filth.

351
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:55,849
Gentlemen, I propose
we kidnap Sir Oinkcelot.

352
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,396
And then we roll him up
in a carpet

353
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,649
and throw him
off a bridge!

354
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,572
(laughing)
What?

355
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,491
-(squeals)
-Look,

356
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,786
you pull
its tail straight,

357
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,869
and it curls
right back up again.

358
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,794
Curly, straight.
Curly, straight.

359
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:17,884
{\an8}Curly, straight.
Curly, straight.

360
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,748
{\an8}(squealing)

361
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,295
Mr. Simpson, I don't think
he likes that.

362
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:26,429
(giggles) Of course he does.
He's a cute little piggy.

363
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,468
Curly, straight.
Curly, straight. Ow!

364
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:32,683
-Why, you little--
-Mr. Simpson, stop!

365
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,845
-It's a defenseless animal!
-(screams)

366
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,694
(groaning, snorting)

367
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,309
Hey, the pig's
acting kinda funny.

368
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,516
He and Mr. Simpson split
a case of malt liquor.

369
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,107
Guys, he's really sick.

370
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,953
Hello! That sounds like
a pig fainting.

371
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,070
(squealing)

372
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,945
I'm sorry, boys.

373
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,657
I-I've never expelled
anyone before,

374
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,247
but that pig
had some powerful friends.

375
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,003
Oh, you'll pay.
Don't think you won't pay!

376
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,879
Guys, believe me.

377
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,756
I didn't mean
to get you expelled.

378
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,392
Oh, don't worry, Mr. Simpson.

379
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,179
We can take care
of ourselves.

380
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,559
Uh, wallet inspector.

381
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,931
Oh, here you go.

382
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,227
I believe that's all
in order.

383
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,560
I can't believe
that worked!

384
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,776
Hey! That's not
the wallet inspector.

385
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,993
-(humming)
-(groans)

386
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,325
Marge, they don't have
anywhere to stay.

387
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,501
And they're geniuses.

388
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,998
They'll solve
all our problems.

389
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,040
They'll elevate us
to the status

390
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,584
of kings on earth!

391
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,877
Mr. Simpson,
we all have nosebleeds.

392
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,711
Oh, for the love of--

393
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,803
-(loud beeping)
-(groans)

394
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,894
What's wrong with this phone?
It's making crazy noises.

395
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,891
Those crazy noises
are computer signals.

396
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,144
Yeah, some guys at M.I.T. are
sending us reasons why

397
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,806
Captain Picard
is better than Captain Kirk.

398
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,565
Ha! They're out
of their minds.

399
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,978
(groans)

400
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,698
Oh, I heard about this.

401
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,658
This is the one where Scratchy
finally gets Itchy.

402
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,950
Wow!

403
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,130

404
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,643
<i>(whistles)</i>

405
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,192
My purpose in life
is to witness this moment.

406
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,030
(screaming)

407
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,738
We need the outlet
for our rock tumbler.

408
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,198
BOTH:
Plug it in! Plug it in!

409
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,108
What, the rock tumbler
or the TV?

410
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,777
BOTH: The TV! The TV!

00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,238

(screaming)

416
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,628
Dad, start digging
some nerd holes.

417
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,425
It's bad enough they put their
retainers in the dishwasher.

418
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,930
Can't we do something?

419
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,641
Look, I'm sure we can
work something out

420
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,932
where we can all live
in harmony. Right, Marge?

421
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,226
No, I want those geeks
out of my house.

422
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,940
You really think you can
get us back into college?

423
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,311
Absolutely.

424
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:30,317
Now, the only antidote
to a zany scheme

425
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,190
is an even zanier scheme!

426
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,107
Why does it
have to be zany?

427
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,196
(gasps)
I've got it!

428
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,571
We're gonna fix it

429
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,078
so you guys save
the dean's life.

430
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,040
-(engine revving)
-Perfect.

431
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,543
(tires screeching)

432
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,875
(whistling)

433
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,551
Okay, guys.

434
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,089
We push him out of the way
in exactly three seconds.

435
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,093
Should we correct
for wind resistance?

436
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,585
Hmm, possibly.
What do you think?

437
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,848
-(thudding)
-Oh, my.

438
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,600
Well, Dean, I'm really sorry
for the running-you-over prank.

439
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,104
Prank?

440
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,185
And all those other pranks
were my idea too.

441
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,941
I'm the one
who should be expelled.

442
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,533
{\an8}Well, I'm touched
by your honesty.

443
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,068
{\an8}And who knows--

444
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,612
{\an8}perhaps I've been a bit
of an ogre myself.

445
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,606
{\an8}-Yes, you have.
-How's this?

446
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,778
{\an8}I'll re-admit your friends,

447
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,117
{\an8}and we'll forget this whole
silly incident ever occurred.

448
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,832
Oh, Dean.
This is what your new hip

449
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:25,963
is going to look like.

450
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,329
(nervous chuckling)

451
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,876
You're gonna have to
go easy on it.

452
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,170
Oh, it's good to be back
after all these weeks.

453
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,125
Better check our
answering machine, huh?

454
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:38,635
WOMAN'S VOICE: <i>Number of</i>
<i>messages received: zero.</i>

455
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,179
(all sighing)

456
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,472
We really want to
thank you, Mr. Simpson.

457
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,556
Ah, no problem, guys.

458
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,271
The important thing
is that we wrapped up

459
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,902
all the loose ends.

460
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,650
So, in conclusion,

461
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,152
good luck on tomorrow's
big final exam.

462
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,154
Exam? Oh!

463
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,856
This is just like one
of those bad dreams!

464
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,156
(screams)

465
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:02,239
What are you gonna do,
Mr. Simpson?

466
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,446
Actually, I've been
working on a plan.

467
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,246
During the exam,
I'll hide under some coats,

468
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,831
and hope that somehow
everything will work out.

469
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,287
Or with our help,

470
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:15,086
you can cram like you've
never crammed before!

471
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,382
Whatever.
Either way is good.

472
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,266
(grunts)

473
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,403
Whoo-hoo!

474
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,994
Oh, man. I can't believe
you failed.

475
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,032
Oh, I'm gonna lose my job

476
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,825
just 'cause I'm
dangerously unqualified!

477
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,660
Mr. Simpson,
there is a way.

478
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,995
We could, well,

479
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,790
use a computer
to change your grade.

480
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,923
(gasps)
Computers can do that?

481
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,300
Oh, yes. The only problem is
the moral dilemma it raises,

482
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,879
-which requires--
-(kissing)

483
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,304
Oh, I love--
Moral whuzzah?

484
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,473
An A-plus!
How did you do it?

485
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,182
Oh, let's just say
I had help from

486
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,314
a little magic box.

487
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,681
You changed your grade
with a computer?

488
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,727
D'oh!

489
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,060
Way to go, Dad!

490
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,444
Look, the important thing

491
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,771
is that
we all learned a lesson.

492
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,146
These guys learned
the richness and variety

493
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,324
of the world outside college.

494
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,743
-No, we didn't.
-Oh.

495
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,911
Then I learned
the real value of college

496
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,871
is to study and work hard.

497
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,121
No, you didn't.

498
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,332
You only passed
your course by cheating,

499
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,713
which you always taught us
was wrong.

500
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,539
-Hmm. True.
-And I learned that

501
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,625
in order for you to set
a good example for your son,

502
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,261
you're gonna take that course
over again without cheating.

503
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,758
Oh, Marge!

504
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,130
You're worse than
that crusty old dean.

505
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,837
(sighs)

506
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,967
Well, I guess it's back
to college for me.

507
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:49,314
And that means it's time to--
What did I teach you guys?

508
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,561
NERDS: Par-ty down?

509
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,403
