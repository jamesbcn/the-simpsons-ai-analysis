1
00:00:13,123 --> 00:00:15,024
...heavy!

2
00:00:16,093 --> 00:00:16,593
Aah!

3
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:18,806
Wrong holiday, stupid.

4
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,411
Ho, ho, ho.

5
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:25,813
Ho, ho, ho, ho...

6
00:00:25,881 --> 00:00:26,981
Ho, ho, ho!

7
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:29,050
I could use some help!

8
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,621
Marge, I'm watching a rerun
of an important bowl game.

9
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:35,623
And that last
touchdown makes it 67 to 13.

10
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:37,058
Maggie!

11
00:00:37,126 --> 00:00:39,627
Lisa, what
are you doing?

12
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:41,596
Marking a crime scene.

13
00:00:41,663 --> 00:00:43,664
To celebrate
an ancient pagan ritual,

14
00:00:43,732 --> 00:00:45,233
this tree was cut down

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,802
and tarted up like a
dime-a-dance floozy.

16
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,004
Oh...

17
00:00:50,072 --> 00:00:52,840
Next you'll have a problem
with my gingerbread house.

18
00:00:52,908 --> 00:00:54,575
You mean
your gingerbread McMansion.

19
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,046
Hey, show some respect.

20
00:00:59,114 --> 00:01:02,150
Three gingerbread workmen
died making that.

21
00:01:02,217 --> 00:01:05,419
I'm sorry,
but this leg's gonna have to go.

22
00:01:07,089 --> 00:01:09,557
You're gonna be okay.

23
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,926
It's almost over.

24
00:01:11,994 --> 00:01:13,661
Now to take care
of the witnesses.

25
00:01:14,863 --> 00:01:17,798
Hey, I need those
cookies for Santa.

26
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:22,270
At least someone around here's
got the Christmas spirit.

27
00:01:22,337 --> 00:01:24,438
Yep. Come midnight,
I'll be sitting here

28
00:01:24,506 --> 00:01:28,209
with cold cookies,
warm milk, and hot lead.

29
00:01:28,277 --> 00:01:29,911
What...?
For the last three years,

30
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:32,880
I've asked that rosy-cheeked
nog-hog for a dirt bike,

31
00:01:32,948 --> 00:01:35,283
and all he brought me
was a zillion lame-o toys

32
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,685
that I immediately broke
and threw in this bag.

33
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:43,357
But you wanted those toys.

34
00:01:43,425 --> 00:01:45,526
I wanted them
till I got them.

35
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:49,230
But this year,
I'm gettin' my dirt bike.

36
00:01:49,298 --> 00:01:52,800
Even Mac Davis himself
couldn't save this Christmas.

37
00:01:52,868 --> 00:01:55,336
Great, Mom. Now I lost track
of my pump count.

38
00:01:55,404 --> 00:01:56,704
One pump, two pump...

39
00:02:06,615 --> 00:02:09,450
Bowl full of jelly,
pump lead in his belly...

40
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:14,121
What?

41
00:02:15,857 --> 00:02:17,792
All aboard the Polar Express!

42
00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:19,527
Direct service
to the North Pole,

43
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:21,562
with stops
at Candy Cane Corners,

44
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,498
Sugarplum Square,
Jack Frost Junction,

45
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:26,133
Fa-La-La-La Lane,

46
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:28,736
Nutcracker Street,
and Hanukkah Heights.

47
00:02:28,804 --> 00:02:30,705
Some "express."

48
00:02:32,107 --> 00:02:33,774
We're flying!

49
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:36,010
Yep, she'll fly, all right.

50
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:37,144
You just got to
keep her happy.

51
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:55,129
♪ Strange days have found us ♪

52
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:04,538
♪ Strange days
have tracked us down... ♪

53
00:03:08,143 --> 00:03:10,311
Excuse me, Mr. Goblin?

54
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:11,812
Elf! I'm an elf!

55
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,180
Whatever you say.

56
00:03:13,248 --> 00:03:15,116
Um, look, how do
I get to Santa?

57
00:03:15,183 --> 00:03:18,102
Oh, no. Only the top
elves get to meet Santa.

58
00:03:18,186 --> 00:03:19,954
You start in the
wrapping room.

59
00:03:20,022 --> 00:03:21,255
That'll take
you right down.

60
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:25,026
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doin'?

61
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:26,394
That leads to the
daycare center.

62
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:27,628
You take the
freight elevator.

63
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:41,909
Isn't this the busy season?

64
00:03:41,977 --> 00:03:43,210
Where is everybody?

65
00:03:43,278 --> 00:03:44,912
Laid off.

66
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,015
After NAFTA, a lot of these
jobs went to the South Pole.

67
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,817
Well, who needs
wrapping paper, anyway?

68
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:52,019
Just stick a bow on the toy
and you're ready to go.

69
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:55,456
Bow, bow, bow, bow,
bing, bang, boom!

70
00:03:55,524 --> 00:03:57,591
Ooh. You are
clearly too smart

71
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,427
to be down here with
these dingle-bells.

72
00:03:59,494 --> 00:04:01,796
I'm promotin' you
to Toy Inspector.

73
00:04:01,863 --> 00:04:03,497
Uh, the rest of youse,
you're laid off.

74
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:04,765
Scram.

75
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,767
I can't lose
my health insurance.

76
00:04:06,835 --> 00:04:08,703
My lungs are full
of candy cane dust!

77
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:12,940
Hey, you twos can go work
for the Easter Bunny.

78
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:15,042
Oh that's right.
He ain't real.

79
00:04:25,654 --> 00:04:29,290
Kid, you got a lot of
shoddy, money-saving ideas.

80
00:04:29,358 --> 00:04:31,892
Like a major airline, but
you were here on time.

81
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,327
Come with me.

82
00:04:41,636 --> 00:04:43,304
So you're the
brown-nosed reindeer

83
00:04:43,372 --> 00:04:45,005
that's jingled all
the way to the top.

84
00:04:45,073 --> 00:04:46,640
Just point me to Santa.

85
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,776
Oh, I know
what you're after.

86
00:04:48,844 --> 00:04:50,745
The toy you never got.

87
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:52,346
You're out
of your elfin mind.

88
00:04:52,414 --> 00:04:54,849
Oh, really?
Well, let me ask you this.

89
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:58,319
How many kids bring
a gun to meet Santa?

90
00:04:58,387 --> 00:04:59,920
Okay. You got me.

91
00:04:59,988 --> 00:05:01,856
And I'm gettin' my dirt bike.
And you can't stop me.

92
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:03,124
Security!

93
00:05:19,775 --> 00:05:22,543
No disrespect, fat man,

94
00:05:22,611 --> 00:05:24,845
but you'd better
crap out a dirt bike.

95
00:05:24,913 --> 00:05:26,480
Close the door, boy.

96
00:05:26,548 --> 00:05:28,549
I can't afford to heat
the whole North Pole!

97
00:05:32,387 --> 00:05:33,921
Listen here, Kringle.

98
00:05:33,989 --> 00:05:35,423
I may have
been naughty this year.

99
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,425
But by today's standards,
naughty's nothing.

100
00:05:37,492 --> 00:05:38,626
I didn't get
anybody pregnant.

101
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:40,027
I didn't Facebook
a kid to death.

102
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:41,662
Make with my dirt bike!

103
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,731
Kid, this company's bust.

104
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,866
For years I've been
giving out free toys

105
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:47,668
and getting
cookies in return.

106
00:05:47,736 --> 00:05:50,404
It's not a sustainable
business model.

107
00:05:50,472 --> 00:05:51,639
Oh, come on, man.

108
00:05:51,706 --> 00:05:53,140
Things aren't that bad.

109
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,942
They're pretty bad.

110
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,577
I'm eating my own reindeer here!

111
00:05:57,679 --> 00:06:00,314
Oh... You win.

112
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:02,683
That's a good boy.

113
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,452
You go home now,

114
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,953
and maybe there'll
be a nice pair

115
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:08,055
of work socks
under your tree.

116
00:06:08,123 --> 00:06:09,557
You don't have
to do that.

117
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:11,959
I have socks.
I'll give you socks!

118
00:06:12,027 --> 00:06:13,594
Thanks, kid.

119
00:06:13,662 --> 00:06:15,162
Now you better
head home.

120
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,798
I'm sure in the 25 years of
Earth time you've been gone,

121
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:19,600
your parents have
gotten worried.

122
00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:23,304
Kids never change.

123
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:25,239

Chesterton-- they feel like me,
singing in your throat.

141
00:07:28,422 --> 00:07:29,956
Can it really be Christmas

142
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:32,425
when one of our parents
is facing the German army?

143
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,460
Simpson, get your helmet on

144
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:35,895
I'm trying.

145
00:07:35,963 --> 00:07:37,830
It just keeps popping off.

146
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,733
<i>Ach du lieber!</i>

147
00:07:42,236 --> 00:07:44,070
You can make it
through this, Marge.

148
00:07:44,138 --> 00:07:45,538
Just think of Homer.

149
00:07:52,813 --> 00:07:54,480
Hey, Simpson.

150
00:07:54,548 --> 00:07:57,583
How come you ain't in
combat like a real man?

151
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:59,652
I'm too fat to
fit in a foxhole.

152
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:04,757
Kids, remember
when I promised to feed us

153
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:06,459
from that victory garden?

154
00:08:06,526 --> 00:08:08,094
Well, instead, I grew this tree.

155
00:08:08,161 --> 00:08:10,663
Don't dare bring that
thing in here.

156
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,765
What? You don't want
a Christmas tree?

157
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:13,999
That's crazy.

158
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:15,801
Next you won't want
a Christmas ham.

159
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:17,303
Don't worry about that.

160
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,239
I love meat and I always will.

161
00:08:20,307 --> 00:08:24,210
Mm-mm! That is
some sweet pig meat.

162
00:08:24,277 --> 00:08:26,779
But as for Christmas trees,
I used to love them,

163
00:08:26,847 --> 00:08:28,147
until last year...

164
00:08:30,717 --> 00:08:33,385
This tree reminds me
of your father.

165
00:08:33,453 --> 00:08:35,888
It's round in the middle,
thinning on top,

166
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:38,591
and your hands get sticky
when you touch it.

167
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:40,459
Simpson, you're shipping
out tonight.

168
00:08:40,527 --> 00:08:42,445
Right before Christmas?

169
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:44,930
Hitler doesn't
take a holiday.

170
00:08:44,998 --> 00:08:46,866
Well, he does, but he
doesn't tell people

171
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:49,335
till the last minute,
so they can't make plans.

172
00:08:49,402 --> 00:08:50,870
Bastard.

173
00:08:50,937 --> 00:08:51,737
But I... oh...

174
00:08:57,277 --> 00:09:00,546
So I never want to see
another Christmas tree

175
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:03,883
until Mom comes back,
safe and sound.

176
00:09:05,285 --> 00:09:06,852
Sweetie, if your mother
was in trouble,

177
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,088
they'd tell us as
soon as they could.

178
00:09:09,156 --> 00:09:10,623
Telegram!
D'oh!

179
00:09:14,227 --> 00:09:16,629
Marge is Mia?

180
00:09:16,696 --> 00:09:17,763
Oh, my God!

181
00:09:17,831 --> 00:09:19,732
She changed her name!

182
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:22,968
No, that says she's
missing in action.

183
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:24,370
Oh, no!

184
00:09:24,437 --> 00:09:26,672
See?

185
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,209
Every time we get
a tree, Mom disappears.

186
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:32,678
Why couldn't it have been me?

187
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:35,080
It still could be. You just have to
go down to the recruiting station...

188
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:36,282
Shut up.

189
00:09:44,591 --> 00:09:46,425
Huh?

190
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,964
Oh, no!

191
00:09:52,032 --> 00:09:54,166
This is where
they took Mom from me.

192
00:09:58,338 --> 00:10:00,139
I've been waiting for you.

193
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:03,909
Your mom paid for this tree

194
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:05,878
last year, but never took it.

195
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:07,279
I've watered it,
kept it fresh,

196
00:10:07,347 --> 00:10:10,115
and every time
I look at this blue spruce,

197
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:11,884
it reminds me
of your good old mom.

198
00:10:11,952 --> 00:10:13,736
Here, let me trim it for you.

199
00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:18,157
And decorate it a little.

200
00:10:19,859 --> 00:10:22,795
It's a sign. Mom's okay.

201
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:25,798
Thank you.

202
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:28,701
Yeah. My only sale all year
and it's not even a sale.

203
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,104
Whose turn is it to cry?

204
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:33,706
Yours.

205
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,412
Quit your bellyaching about
Marge and let me read the paper.

206
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,513
Look at that picture!

207
00:10:46,152 --> 00:10:48,220
Oh, for cryin' out loud.

208
00:10:50,624 --> 00:10:51,957
Huh?

209
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:54,226
I thought you said you
didn't want a tree.

210
00:10:54,294 --> 00:10:57,196
Yes, but then I learned that
there's always hope.

211
00:10:57,264 --> 00:10:59,665
Someday this war will be over.

212
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:01,634
Someday our mom will be back.

213
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:05,738
Someday TV will be invented,
and it will be free.

214
00:11:05,805 --> 00:11:07,006
Then it will cost money.

215
00:11:07,073 --> 00:11:08,674
But until then,
this tree will stand

216
00:11:08,742 --> 00:11:10,576
for everything Mom believes in:

217
00:11:10,644 --> 00:11:14,413
home, family, and constantly
sweeping up needles.

This is the last time
I bring these two

229
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,901
to bed at the same time.

Marge Simpson, I'm on my way.

234
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:32,238
Wake up, Marge.

235
00:13:32,305 --> 00:13:34,273
Magical memories
don't make themselves.

236
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:36,375
Martha Stewart!

237
00:13:36,443 --> 00:13:38,210
How did you get in here?

238
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:39,912
A picket fence
stood on its end

239
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,714
makes a sturdy
and attractive ladder.

240
00:13:41,782 --> 00:13:43,082
Now let's make that bed.

241
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:55,161
A smattering of pinecones.

242
00:13:55,228 --> 00:13:56,962
And with a little bit of work,
this wedding dress

243
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,331
can make a great dust ruffle.

244
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,268
B-But I was gonna--
oh... Ooh!

245
00:14:05,038 --> 00:14:08,107
So this stuff will
just shampoo out, huh?

246
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:09,708
Why would you want
to shampoo it out?

247
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,346
Me and Milhouse had
a snowball fight,

248
00:14:14,414 --> 00:14:16,916
then an ice-ball fight,
then a fight-fight.

249
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:19,485
You boys want to play soldier?

250
00:14:19,553 --> 00:14:22,621
I can't think of a better way
to spend Jesus's birthday.

251
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:31,964
I'm not sure I like
where this is going.

252
00:14:32,032 --> 00:14:34,300
Well, I'm not sure anyone
asked your opinion.

253
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:49,748
Squeeze your shoulder
blades together.

254
00:14:49,816 --> 00:14:52,218
Now march,
and after an hour you can relax

255
00:14:52,285 --> 00:14:54,286
with some hand-shaved hot cocoa

256
00:14:54,354 --> 00:14:57,223
and a trial subscription
to <i>Martha Stewart Living.</i>

257
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,924
Yay!

258
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:02,728
And out.
Ms. Stewart,

259
00:15:02,796 --> 00:15:06,465
I made a star for the tree
out of discarded water bottles.

260
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:08,434
Lovely, dear, except
I would have soaked

261
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:09,835
the labels off
with warm water.

262
00:15:09,903 --> 00:15:11,437
Then I would have
melted the plastic down

263
00:15:11,504 --> 00:15:12,805
in the double boiler

264
00:15:12,873 --> 00:15:14,406
and poured it
into a candy mold.

265
00:15:14,474 --> 00:15:17,610
And finally, I wouldn't have
presented it quite so proudly.

266
00:15:17,677 --> 00:15:19,211
I'll go outside
and make snow angels.

267
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,946
Lie face down

268
00:15:21,014 --> 00:15:23,515
and your beautiful smile
will be molded into the snow.

269
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,818
Okay.

270
00:15:35,295 --> 00:15:38,163
Now this is
a challenge.

271
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:48,173
There, a slumbering hubby

272
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:50,542
is now a traditional
Christmas tableau.

274
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:56,382
He's starting
to wake up.

275
00:15:56,449 --> 00:15:57,950
A little
of my Hubby's Holiday Helper

276
00:15:58,018 --> 00:16:00,586
will calm him
right down.

277
00:16:02,756 --> 00:16:04,390
Don't worry, Marge,
it's a good thing.

278
00:16:04,457 --> 00:16:06,525
There, there.

279
00:16:06,593 --> 00:16:07,893
Shh...

280
00:16:11,398 --> 00:16:13,265
Martha, the house
looks beautiful.

281
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,201
It's like Christmas with
a childless gay couple.

282
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:17,536
But it's just
not the same

283
00:16:17,604 --> 00:16:19,872
without my family
being themselves.

284
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,241
Well, thanks for
wasting my time.

285
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:23,976
I'll just wave my magic wand

286
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:25,711
and turn everything
back the way it was.

287
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:27,212
You have a magic wand?

288
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,781
Yes, I made it myself.

289
00:16:28,848 --> 00:16:31,183
Take an old car antenna,
marinate it overnight

290
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:33,919
in the tears of a heartbroken
leprechaun, bake at 350

291
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:36,355
till a rainbow shoots out of
the oven, and there you go.

292
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,528
I guess I'll never have
a perfect Christmas.

293
00:16:42,595 --> 00:16:44,530
Merry Christmas, Mom!

294
00:16:44,597 --> 00:16:46,198

Did you get a good
house sitter?

309
00:17:38,383 --> 00:17:40,484
Moe Szyslak,
house sitter extraordinaire.

310
00:17:42,053 --> 00:17:43,921
Sticks and stones
may break my bones...

311
00:17:43,972 --> 00:17:45,356
Ow! Hey, stop it!

312
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:47,341
Ooh, cookies!

313
00:17:51,012 --> 00:17:53,431
Great at the chewing,
not so hot at the swallowing.

314
00:17:53,498 --> 00:17:56,300
Now, remember,
pack only necessities.

315
00:18:01,907 --> 00:18:03,307
Hey, baby, it's Moe.

316
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,075
Calling youse
from my new bachelor pad

317
00:18:05,143 --> 00:18:08,162
at 742 Evergreen Terrace.

318
00:18:08,246 --> 00:18:11,782
Yeah, okay, sugar plum,
I'll see you soon.

319
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,350
Hey, get this off.
Hey, get this off!

320
00:18:16,188 --> 00:18:19,256
Now nothing stands between
us and sunny Hawa...

321
00:18:19,324 --> 00:18:20,558
Merry Humbug, everyone.

322
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,159
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi!

323
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,694
What's wrong, Homie?

324
00:18:23,762 --> 00:18:25,729
I got the week off
by telling Mr. Burns

325
00:18:25,797 --> 00:18:27,598
I had a neck injury.

326
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:31,902
Mr. Burns, why'd you
come to see me?

327
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,439
Well, last night, I had a
visit from three spirits.

328
00:18:35,507 --> 00:18:38,392
I wish this show had a visit
from three new writers.

329
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:42,313
Wait, what's this?

330
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,732
Carpetbags and
portmanteaus?

331
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:46,350
Going somewhere,
Simpson?

332
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:48,452
Uh, uh...

333
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,623
Hey, guys, uh, you'll need this
on your trip to Hawaii... aah!

334
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,625
Hmm, your
goblin fainted.

335
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:56,243
Not a goblin.

336
00:18:56,328 --> 00:18:58,195
Simpson,
where's your Christmas tree?

337
00:18:58,246 --> 00:18:59,797
Coming!

338
00:18:59,864 --> 00:19:02,233
Homer, give me
back my tree!

339
00:19:12,677 --> 00:19:15,346
Well, I won't interrupt
your holiday any longer.

340
00:19:15,397 --> 00:19:17,581
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good--

341
00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:21,151
pop superstar/fashionista
Katy Perry?!

342
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:29,426
What are you people doing in
my boyfriend Moe's bachelor pad?

343
00:19:29,494 --> 00:19:31,946
That's right,
she's into puppets.

344
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,931
Just what's going on here?

345
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:35,733
Fine, I'll come clean.

346
00:19:37,102 --> 00:19:39,203
It's a Christmas miraculum.

347
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:41,121
No, it's not.

348
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:44,108
I just told a lie
so we could go to Hawaii.

349
00:19:44,175 --> 00:19:45,759
You lied to me.

350
00:19:45,844 --> 00:19:47,878
Release the hounds.

351
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,102
Oh, they'll be here
any minute.

352
00:19:58,623 --> 00:20:00,824
We, uh, blew the budget
on Katy Perry.

353
00:20:00,892 --> 00:20:02,026
D'oh.

354
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:03,927
Someone totally needs a hug.

355
00:20:07,432 --> 00:20:09,867
I kissed a girl
and I liked it.

356
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,822
All is forgiven,
Simpsons.

357
00:20:14,906 --> 00:20:17,625
Go and enjoy "Ha-vah-ee."

358
00:20:19,477 --> 00:20:22,046
Just as soon as we sing
one Christmas carol.

359
00:20:22,113 --> 00:20:25,633
Oh, man, not the lame-o
"12 Days of Christmas."

360
00:20:25,717 --> 00:20:26,950
Of course not.

361
00:20:27,002 --> 00:20:28,686
I want to sing
the original, unabridged

362
00:20:28,753 --> 00:20:30,337
"39 Days Of Christmas."

363
00:20:30,422 --> 00:20:31,989

<i>Tonight's</i> Simpsons <i>episode</i>

375
00:20:55,647 --> 00:20:57,348
<i>was brought to you
by the symbol umlaut</i>

376
00:20:57,415 --> 00:20:59,083
<i>and the number e.</i>

377
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,185
<i>Not the letter e,
but the number</i>

378
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:04,021
<i>whose exponential function
is the derivative of itself.</i>

379
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:07,324
Well, it's been a long run,
but I think this'll kill it.

380
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:08,993
What, <i>The Simpsons?</i>

381
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,294
No, Christmas.

382
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:16,500
<i>We did that one already.</i>

383
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:17,434
<i>Shh.</i>

384
00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:47,803
I-I'll just kiss
your belly button.

385
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,983
Oh, uh, that's not
my belly button.

386
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:53,612
<i>But I didn't say stop.</i>
