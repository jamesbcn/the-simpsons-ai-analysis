-Pure hilarity.

that I'm a patient,

and that there was no line
you could cross

141

that could make me
stop loving you.

142
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:47,066
But last night,
you didn't just cross that line,

143
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,026
you threw up on it!

00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,304
you might have noticed Daddy
acting a little strange,

152
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,045
and you probably
don't understand why.

153
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,847
I understand why.
You were wasted.

154
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,520
I admit it. I didn't know
when to say when.

155
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,229
I'm sorry it happened.

156
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,939
I just hope you didn't lose
a lot of respect for me.

Now, before I give you all a sneak

160
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:28,447

for couples whose marriages
are hanging by a thread--

175
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,940
(groans)

176
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,196
-...or those just in need of a tune-up.
-Hmm?

177
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,658
Now, if you wish to participate,
please sign up in the lobby

178
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,369
-after the service is over.
-(bell tolling)

179
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,040
Will the Simpsons be attending
our little retreat?

180
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,249
Oh, well, it's very tempting.

181
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,080
Really a wonderful idea.

182
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,455
Marge! What are you doing?
Are you insane?

183
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,133
No! Give it to--

184
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,673
-We'll be there.
-D'oh!

185
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,931
Marriage encounter weekend,
here I come.

186
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,722
Now you want to go?

187
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,845
They're holding it
at Catfish Lake.

188
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,143
They couldn't
call it Catfish Lake

189
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,597
if it didn't have
a catfish in it.

190
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,397
We're going to this retreat to give
our marriage a tune-up and that's all.

191
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,192
-No fishing.
-Oh!

192
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,275
-(doorbell rings)
-That must be the baby-sitter.

193
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,451
-Hello. I'm Mrs. Simpson.
-Simpson...

194
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,621
-Simpson...
-(chuckles) Come back for more, eh?

195
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,990
(gasps)

196
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,867
(screaming)

197
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,664
(screaming fades)

198
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,707
(engine starts)

199
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,501
(screaming resumes)

200
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,046
(screaming)

201
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,669
-Hey! What? What?
-Oh my!

202
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,007
Where are we supposed to get
a sitter on such short notice?

203
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:16,813
Oh dear, if we can't find
a baby-sitter, we can't go.

204
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,099
What a kick in the teeth.

205
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,982
What do you need
a baby-sitter for?

206
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,099
-I'm almost 10 and a half.
-Mom, you wouldn't dare.

207
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,596
Don't take that tone
with me young lady,

208
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,648
or I'll give you a taste
of the back of me hand.

209
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,690
No you don't!

210
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,323
-Grampa?
-Hey! Yow! What?

211
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,781
Grampa, could you do something?

212
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,611
-I can dress myself.
-Oh. Well, I was wondering.

213
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,198
Do you think you could
baby-sit the kids this weekend?

214
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,084
I wouldn't ask,
except I'm desperate.

215
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,790
Oh, sure. Last resort.
Old Grampa, the feeb,

216
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:47,253
the guy who can't be counted on
for nothing, nohow, dag-nab it.

217
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,456
Everyone's against me.

218
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,467
I'll do it.

219
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,839
Marge, just putting
a few last things in the trunk.

220
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,966
(chuckles)

221
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,513
Now, if Maggie runs a fever,
you call this number.

222
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,848
If she sticks her finger in
an electrical socket, call this number.

223
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,564
And if she drinks pine cleanser,
call this.

224
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,774
Just give the list!
I can read.

225
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,315
Alright, alright.

226
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,938
Good-bye, children,
and behave yourselves.

227
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,485
Mwah!

228
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,030
Call this number if Grampa
falls in the bathtub.

229
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,074
-I heard that.
-ALL: Bye.

230
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,538
Grampa, Mom was in such a hurry,
she forget to give you this.

231
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,040
It's a list of the things
Lisa and I can and can't do.

232
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,293
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

233
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,535
You're allowed to smoke cigars?

234
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,339
HOMER:
Hmm... bait.

235
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,012
Uh-oh. Better get some gas.

236
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,926
Fill 'er up.

237
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:44,015
I guess I'll go
and stretch my legs.

238
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,981
(bell dinging)

239
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,073
-Where are you headed?
-Catfish Lake.

240
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,278
Oh, after General Sherman,
are you?

241
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,319
Wait a minute.
Who's General Sherman?

242
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,402
He's only the biggest catfish
in these parts.

243
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,818
-Oh, yeah?
-They say he weighs upwards of 500 pounds.

244
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,077
-Whoa. Who says that?
-They do.

245
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,199
HOMER:
Oh.

246
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,996
Yeah, that there is the only known
picture of the general.

247
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,920
Can't see what he is, exactly.

248
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,248
He's freakishly big, though.

249
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,463
Hmm...

250
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,882
Gentlemen, I am going

251
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:11,921
to catch General Sherman.

252
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,884
Ooh...

253
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,094
Oh, my.

254
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,844
After the supermarket,

255
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,966
we'll go to the video store,
grab a Krusty Burger

256
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,103
and head for the arcade.

257
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,930
Bart, Grampa's a kindly
old man who trusts us.

258
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,636
Are you sure it's right
to take advantage of him?

259
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,847
Lise, in these crazy,
topsy-turvy times,

260
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,858
who's to say
what's right or wrong?

261
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,190
But right now, my gut's
telling me "bleed Gramps dry."

262
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,776
Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson,
welcome.

263
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,242
Hello, Reverend.
We're glad we could come.

264
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,083
-Hello, Helen.
-Hello, Marge.

265
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,618
Why, Homer Simpson.

266
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,372
Here to give your marriage
a little spit shine?

267
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,214
None of your business,
Flanders.

268
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,789
Say, Reverend, are we gonna get
a chance to do any fishing?

269
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,916
Oh, I'm afraid not. A marriage
can't be reconciled in a few hours, Homer.

270
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,085
It takes a whole weekend
to do that.

271
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,394
-Oh.
-We must bait our hooks with honesty,

272
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,468
that way, a happy marriage
won't be the one that got away.

273
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,305
I see.

274
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,850
I also understand
bowling expressions.

275
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,944
Ah! Three couples.
Our best turnout yet.

276
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,729
Why don't we go around the room

277
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,863
and everyone
can introduce themselves

278
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,110
and tell us a little bit
about why they're here?

279
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,242
John, Gloria?

280
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,528
My name's Gloria.

281
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,161
I'm here because Johnny-boy

282
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,239
hasn't been able to cut it
man-wise for some time.

283
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,865
Not that I'd want his odor
of gin and sour defeat

284
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,624
pressed against me.

285
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,496
-That's enough, Gloria!
-Thank you, Gloria.

286
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,883
John, why don't you tell us
a little about why you're here?

287
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:37,211
She never cooks, she keeps
a filthy house and she talks profanely.

288
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,718
-She's the queen of the harpies.
-No, I'm not.

289
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,090
-Queen of the harpies.
-No, I'm not.

290
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,927
Here's your crown,
Your Majesty!

291
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,892
-Queen of the harpies!
-Get away from me, you swine!

292
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,972
You've come
to the right place.

293
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:51,227
First, I want you to look
into each other's eyes.

294
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,772
-(both gasp)
-Your eyes,

295
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,777
I've forgotten
how beautiful they are.

296
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,279
-Let's never fight again.
-We were fools to argue.

297
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,741
-Let's not talk about that.
-Let's not talk at all!

298
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,742
Remember my saving your lives
and bringing you happiness

299
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,164
when we pass the collection
plate next week.

300
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:10,333
(chuckles) All right, Ned, Maude,
what brings you here?

301
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,334
-Well...
-Go on, Neddy.

302
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,246
Sometimes Maude,
God bless her,

303
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,165
she underlines passages
in my Bible

304
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,303
because she can't find hers.

305
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,300
Oh, lucky you don't keep guns
in the house.

306
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,722
-Homer, why are you here?
-Oh...

307
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,852
Because I got drunk
and looked down her dress.

308
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,389
-(gasps)
-No, no, Homer.

309
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,522
Marge is going to tell us
all your faults.

310
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,519
Why don't you tell us
about hers?

311
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,601
-Oh, she's perfect.
-Come on, Homer. What are her faults?

312
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,107
-Well, sometimes it can be annoying.
-Oh, Homer.

313
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,190
-Marge, don't interrupt.
-You'll get your turn.

314
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,985
-I'm done.
-Okay. Marge?

315
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,359
Well, it's not that
I don't love the guy.

316
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,487
I'm always sticking up for him.

317
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,374
It's just that he's
so self-centered.

318
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,252
-(gasps) Wait! Oh!
-Now, Homer.

319
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,170
He forgets birthdays,
anniversaries, holidays--

320
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,340
both religious and secular.

321
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,668
He chews with his mouth open.
He gambles.

322
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,594
He hangs out at a seedy bar
with bums and lowlifes.

323
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,094
(sobbing) It's true.
It's all true.

324
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,636
-Homer, don't interrupt.
-Sorry.

325
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,679
He blows his nose
on the towels

326
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,353
and puts them back
in the middle.

327
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,851
I only did that
a couple of times.

328
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,694
-Half a gallon of chocolate.
-Check.

329
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,769
-Half a gallon of chocolate brownie fudge.
-Check.

330
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,314
Half a gallon of chocolate
chocolate chocolate chip.

331
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,227
Yep.

332
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,904
Did your mom really write
that shopping list?

333
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,284
-Grampa, what a question.
-What's next, Lise?

334
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,741
Sprinkles and syrups.

335
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,201
Hey Grampa, aisle six,
and step on it.

336
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,531
All right,
but put out that cigar.

337
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,025
MARGE:
He drinks out of the carton.

338
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,498
He never changes the baby.

339
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,539
When he goes to sleep,
he makes chewing noises,

340
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,503
and when he wakes up,
he makes honking noises.

341
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:41,125
Oh, oh, and he scratches himself
with his keys.

342
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,763
I guess that's it.

343
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,380
Oh, no, wait.
He kicks me in his sleep,

344
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,347
and his toenails
are too long and yellow.

345
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,389
That's all I can think of
right now.

346
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,182
I guess you're all tired.

347
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,886
I want to thank you for letting
me get some things off my chest.

348
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,097
(groans)

349
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,346
Well, we've missed the luau.

350
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,148
What's say we call it a night.

351
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,361
<i>But, Captain I can't avenge</i>

352
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,862
<i>my partner's death</i>
<i>with this peashooter.</i>

353
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,454
I don't want to hear it, McBain.

354
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,359
That cannon of yours
is against regulations.

355
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,988
In this department,
we go by the book.

356
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,042
Bye, book.

357
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,580
-Cool!
-All right, McBain!

358
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,423
You know kids,
it's getting pretty late.

359
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,958
Yeah, you should go
to bed, Grampa.

360
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,342
We've had a big day.

361
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,128
You wise guy,
little smart aleck.

362
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,712
It's no use kidding myself.

363
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,877
I'm having an ethical crisis.

364
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,140
Out at 5:00.
Catch General Sherman at 5:30.

365
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,810
Clean him at 6:00.

366
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,309
Eat him at 6:30.

367
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,520
Back in bed by 7:00
with no incriminating evidence.

368
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,602
Heh-heh-heh,
The perfect crime.

369
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,857
Homer?
(gasps)

370
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,190
You're sneaking out
to go fishing.

371
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,275
I can't believe
your selfishness.

372
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,111
You can go fishing anytime,

373
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,276
but we're here trying
to save our marriage.

374
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,616
You're thinking about fishing

375
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,291
even when I'm talking
right now, right?

376
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,870
Would this be a good time
to be honest?

377
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,205
-Yes.
-You're right, I am.

378
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,750
Help me, Marge.

379
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,213
What do I do to be a good guy?

380
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,384
Get back in bed.

381
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,262
Oh, all right.

382
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,386
But I can't sleep.

383
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,468
Can I take a walk?

384
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,853
Sure.

385
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,520
Got to be a good husband.

386
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,429
Got to be a good husband.

387
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,398
I got to be a good husband.

388
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,478
Hey, kid,
you forgot your...

389
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,653
(screams)

390
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,862
(screaming)

391
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,373
Go ahead, General Sherman,
foist your strength,

392
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,159
you big, ugly catfish.

393
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,834
I got a skillet and a stick
of butter with your name on it.

394
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,924
Hmm? Hmm? Homer?

395
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,040
(Homer yelling)

396
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,797
Hmm? Hmm.

397
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,168
-Sugar?
-Yes, ten please.

398
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,797
Hey, Grampa, top me off.

399
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,643
Are you sure your Ma
lets you kids drink coffee?

400
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,599
For the last time, yes!

401
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,139
Come on, give up.

402
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,562
Huh?

403
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,270
D'oh!

404
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,350
Hey, Milhouse.
Big blowout at Casa de Simpson.

405
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,726
The only adult
is frail and old.

406
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,773
Bart's joint.
Uh, two-ish.

407
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,147
Be there or be square.

408
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,193
Tell my friends?
All right,

409
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,567
but I got some
pretty funky friends.

410
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,454
All right.
I get out at noon

411
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,121
and I'm already invited
to a party.

412
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,990
Now, this is a trust exercise.

413
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,037
You fall backwards

414
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,671
and rely on your spouse
to catch you.

415
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,165
Do I have to do this?

416
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:31,264
No. Even if your husband were here,
I wouldn't recommend it.

417
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:34,801
Marge, as a trained marriage counselor,
this is the first instance

418
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,217
where I've ever told one partner
that they were 100% right.

419
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,017
It's all his fault.

420
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,440
And I'm willing to put that

421
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,398
on a certificate
you can frame.

422
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,979
<i>♪ Over there ♪</i>

00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,524

-Ahh!

427
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,072
(crowd clamoring)

428
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:59,035
Okay, fish, you're probably
wondering why I'm still here.

429
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,369
Catching you will make me the most
famous fisherman there is...

430
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:07,036
right up there with that...
the, uh...

431
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,087
the bald guy
on the cable fishing show.

432
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,379
Whoa! Holy mackerel!

433
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,097
-(music continues)
-(clamoring continues)

434
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,888
Milhouse, didn't see you, pal.
Look out, my man.

435
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,391
Cherry party, Bart.
Any chicks over eight?

436
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,144
Not yet,
but the afternoon is young.

437
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,650
-Lisa, what's wrong?
-Isn't it obvious?

438
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,692
We've degraded ourselves
and set back

439
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,736
the children's rights movement
for decades to come.

440
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,400
You're great at a party, Lise.
Really great.

441
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,988
Hey, you! Don't!

442
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,783
Shut that door! Stop it!

443
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,906
-Put that away!
-(plates crashing)

444
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,082
No! Stop! Oh!

445
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,411
-Ow!
-(laughing)

446
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,037
You young hellion,
you want me to take off my belt?

447
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,165
-Yeah.
-All right, I'll show you.

448
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,052
-(laughing)
-Doggone it.

449
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,880
(straining)

450
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,835
I love you,

451
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,335
but I must kill you.

452
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,598
Yeah, take care, man.
Hey, thanks for coming.

453
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,814
Hey, nice tie, Nelson.

454
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,353
Oh, thanks.
It's your dad's.

455
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,816
(crying)
I tried to be a good baby-sitter

456
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,528
but I failed.

457
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:15,028
I'm a feeb, a useless,
old, worn-down...

458
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:19,322
(crying)

459
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,868
{\an8}Lisa, I have this strong unpleasant
feeling I've never had before.

460
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:26,253
{\an8}It's called remorse, you vile
burlesque of irrepressible youth.

461
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,921
{\an8}How do you make
this feeling go away?

462
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,920
{\an8}You grab a bucket and a brush

463
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,092
{\an8}and you clean harder and faster
than you ever have before.

464
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,131
(crying)

465
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,134
-Huh?
-(door slams)

466
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,465

Hi, honey.

473
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,156
Uh, how's the marriage
retreat going?

474
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,410
We came to this retreat because
I thought our marriage was in trouble.

475
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,833
But I never for a minute thought
it was in this much trouble.

476
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,543
Homer, how can you expect--

477
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,633
Marge? Marge, you don't know
what this fish means.

478
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,038
This fish represents
a better life for both of us.

479
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,247
This fish makes me a champion
and a hero.

480
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,088
-To who?
-To those weirdos in the worm store.

481
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,644
All this fish represents
is just how selfish you are.

482
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,008
Well, if that's the way
you feel, I'll throw it back.

483
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,965
-Oh, yeah, sure.
-Watch!

484
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,676
(grunting)

485
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:30,597
Whoa, I did it.

486
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:34,067
I gave up fame and breakfast
for my marriage.

487
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,609
I fought it for six hours.

488
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,952
She says one word,
and I toss it back.

489
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:41,948
And you're telling me
our marriage is in trouble?

490
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,872
Come here, baby.

491
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,791
Oh, Homer.

492
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,963
(grunting)

493
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,752
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

494
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,880
Eww.

495
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,507
Hmm.

496
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,590
Mmm.

497
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,806
(tires screech)

498
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,941
-We're back.
-How's your marriage?

499
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,229
Same as usual--
perfectomundo.

500
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,903
Oh, my!
The house looks wonderful!

501
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,073
Grampa, what's your secret?

502
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,570
Pretending to cry.
(laughing)

503
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,324
That's right, you heard me!

504
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,986
Pretending to cry!

505
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:27,294
(laughing) I can turn it
on and off like a faucet.

506
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,959
(crying)
Oh, I'm crying. I'm so sad.

507
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,169
{\an8}Way to go, Grampa.

508
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,210
{\an8}I'll never trust
another old person.

509
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,964
{\an8}I fooled you.

510
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,165
{\an8}So long, suckers.

511
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,375
{\an8}(chuckling)

512
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,554
Yeah. General Sherman.

513
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:45,013
They say he's 500 pounds of
bottom-dwelling fury, don't you know.

514
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,845
No one knows how old he is,

515
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,640
but if you ask me,
and most people do,

516
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,184
he's a hundred years
if he's a day.

517
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,387
And no one's ever caught him?

518
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,476
Well, one fella came close.

519
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,351
Went by the name of Homer.

520
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:57,518
Seven feet tall, he was,
with arms like tree trunks

521
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,147
and his eyes were like steel:
cold and hard.

522
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,235
Had a shock of hair--

523
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,860
red, like the fires of hell.

524
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,407

525
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,951
Shh!
