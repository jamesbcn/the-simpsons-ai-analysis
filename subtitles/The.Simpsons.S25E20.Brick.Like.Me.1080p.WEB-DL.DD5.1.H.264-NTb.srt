2
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:24,554
(snoring)

3
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:26,186
MARGE: Homie! Homie, wake up!

4
00:00:26,212 --> 00:00:27,793
You're having a nightmare.

5
00:00:27,805 --> 00:00:30,132
HOMER: It's not selling out.
It's co-branding.

6
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,377
- Co-branding!
- MARGE: Wake up!

7
00:00:32,404 --> 00:00:34,038
(Homer grunting)

8
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:39,153
Oh, honey, the best part of every day
is waking up to your smiling face.

9
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:40,366
Oh...

10
00:00:40,384 --> 00:00:42,586
Just like the best day
of my life was when you

11
00:00:42,612 --> 00:00:44,988
gave me your hand
in marriage. (pop)

12
00:00:45,022 --> 00:00:46,475
- Ooh.
- (chuckles)

13
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,645
I'd like it back, please.

14
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:49,878
(barks)

15
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:51,568
Hey! Drop it,
you stupid dog!

16
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:53,162
That's one of my
wife's pieces!

17
00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:55,772
She needs it to
reciprocate high fives!

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,747
(Homer grunting)

19
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:02,827
That's okay, Homie.
I'll just grab another.

20
00:01:03,675 --> 00:01:04,822
Mmm...

21
00:01:04,842 --> 00:01:08,488
Oh... I haven't worn this
one since New Year's.

22
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:12,202
(sizzling)

23
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:16,638
Hmm. Is it just me, or
does something seem...

24
00:01:16,654 --> 00:01:18,061
weird today?

25
00:01:18,082 --> 00:01:22,891
You're right... something <i>is
</i> different about the Simpsons today.

26
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:25,244
Your father's
wearing a <i>tie.</i>

27
00:01:25,262 --> 00:01:27,182
Oh, <i>that's</i> what's
different!

28
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:30,684
- That's the one and only thing.
- Maggie! Stop that!

29
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:32,876
No more playing
with your food.

30
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,187
Aw, they're so cute
when they're Duplo.

31
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:43,296
Uh, yes, is this
a toy store?

32
00:01:43,309 --> 00:01:46,435
Uh-huh. I'm supposed to get my
daughter a birthday present...

33
00:01:46,453 --> 00:01:48,230
hmm, what's it called?

34
00:01:48,246 --> 00:01:51,199
Here it is. Perky
Patty's Princess Shop.

35
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:53,186
- (grunts)
- (groans)

36
00:01:53,203 --> 00:01:57,127
Oh! I'm so sorry... but I
have an awesome excuse:

37
00:01:57,148 --> 00:01:58,889
I was distracted driving.

38
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,337
Oh, don't worry about it.

39
00:02:00,364 --> 00:02:02,917
(chuckles): Good thing
we don't feel pain.

40
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:05,187
Hey! These are
the monkey's legs!

41
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,484
(whimpers)

42
00:02:06,504 --> 00:02:08,003
(panicked chattering)

43
00:02:08,026 --> 00:02:11,559
Come back! I'm a clown! I can't
afford to look ridiculous!

44
00:02:11,578 --> 00:02:13,112
(school bell ringing)

45
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:16,090
Hey, Bart, check out what
I brought for share day.

46
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:17,910
BART:
Whoa! A skunk!

47
00:02:17,935 --> 00:02:19,368
Who should we stink first?

48
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:21,946
It can't spray...
it's been de-sacked.

49
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:25,783
Ew! The gypsy
skunk-seller lied!

50
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:27,618
(panicked yelling)

51
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,410
He went in there!

52
00:02:35,926 --> 00:02:40,706
Stop it! If you pull out those bricks,
the whole school could collapse!

53
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:42,299
But there's a
skunk in there.

54
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:44,765
(gasps)
Scottish steak!

55
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:49,203
(students groaning)

56
00:02:53,457 --> 00:02:54,410
(both gasp)

57
00:02:55,317 --> 00:02:58,048
You are going to rebuild
every brick of this school.

58
00:02:58,062 --> 00:03:00,509
This says: Ages 12 and up.

59
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:03,173
Age guidelines are conservative,
and everyone knows it.

60
00:03:05,323 --> 00:03:09,174
And to motivate you, some words
of support from the school chum.

61
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,737
Haw-haw!

62
00:03:15,286 --> 00:03:16,695
SKINNER:
Thank you, Nelson.

63
00:03:17,842 --> 00:03:19,209
(Homer humming)

64
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:24,240
One Perky Patty's
Princess Shop, please.

65
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:26,955
Ah. Always good to
meet a fellow AMFOP.

66
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:30,001
- Huh?
- Adult Male Fan of Princesses.

67
00:03:30,021 --> 00:03:31,308
It's for my daughter.

68
00:03:31,328 --> 00:03:33,081
Yes, yes, it's always
for the daughter.

69
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:37,297
Well, that's weird. I feel like
I've seen this toy before.

70
00:03:37,321 --> 00:03:39,588
(rumbling)

71
00:03:40,202 --> 00:03:43,824
- Do you like it, honey?
- I love it, Dad! Thank you.

72
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:46,241
Well, have fun
putting it together.

73
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:49,198
Wait, wha... Dad, don't you
want to build it <i>with</i> me?

74
00:03:49,218 --> 00:03:53,182
Well, there's no dad on the box.
I don't want to get in trouble.

75
00:03:53,704 --> 00:03:56,380
(laughs):
Of course I do!

76
00:04:01,278 --> 00:04:02,818
Mm-hmm.

77
00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:06,989
Well, what do you know?
I <i>enjoyed</i> playing with you.

78
00:04:07,002 --> 00:04:07,989
Me, too, Dad.

79
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:09,721
No, no, no.
Listen to me.

80
00:04:09,747 --> 00:04:13,578
We played... and
it wasn't boring.

81
00:04:13,623 --> 00:04:15,132
We've played
lots of times.

82
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:16,818
Of course we have!

83
00:04:16,837 --> 00:04:19,090
Because you're my
girl and I love you.

84
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:21,016
But I'm letting you
in on a secret.

85
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:25,569
When parents play with their
kids, they don't like it.

86
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:27,693
- And I'm no different.
- Oh.

87
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:29,420
Suddenly I can't breathe.

88
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:33,063
Every fiber of my being
screams out for a nap.

89
00:04:33,075 --> 00:04:35,522
And if someone handed me an
issue of <i>The New Yorker,</i>

90
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,369
(chuckles): I would
read the fiction.

91
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:39,285
I swear to God I would.

92
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:43,234
Wow. But there are millions
of parents in the world.

93
00:04:43,247 --> 00:04:46,167
- Surely some of them like playing with...
- Nope, not even one.

94
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:50,675
Just look at the things you kids
like: Tea parties with pretend food;

95
00:04:50,694 --> 00:04:53,339
Hide-and-seek with
<i>flagrant</i> peeking;

96
00:04:53,365 --> 00:04:57,635
And the most inhumane torture
ever devised by man...

97
00:04:57,655 --> 00:04:59,459
(shudders)

98
00:04:59,472 --> 00:05:01,132
Candy Land.

99
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:03,154
- Oh.
- But this...

100
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:05,988
this is tolerable!

101
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:08,123
(gasping breaths)

102
00:05:08,138 --> 00:05:09,625
What a crazy vision.

103
00:05:09,638 --> 00:05:13,661
I was in a world where nothing is
made of bricks, except for toys!

104
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,145
Hey, read the sign.

105
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,533
Thank you.

106
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:19,465
(whimpering)

107
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:22,957
Marge, I'm telling you,
it was so weird.

108
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:28,744
My body was squishy, and my hands
looked like snakes made of meat!

109
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:30,038
It was horrible!

110
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:33,503
Oh, Homie, it was probably
just a mini-stroke.

111
00:05:33,523 --> 00:05:35,936
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

112
00:05:35,963 --> 00:05:37,963
Whatever you saw,
it wasn't real.

113
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:40,036
That's how the
world works.

114
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:44,211
Everything fits with everything
else, and nobody ever gets hurt.

115
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:45,296
I know.

116
00:05:45,316 --> 00:05:48,099
Oh, maybe you just
need someone to...

117
00:05:48,112 --> 00:05:51,113
you know, take
your mind off it?

118
00:05:51,153 --> 00:05:51,993
Hm?

119
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:54,033
I always need that.

120
00:05:54,057 --> 00:05:58,144
I only don't ask because
being rejected...

121
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,053
(breathily):
gets old.

122
00:06:01,305 --> 00:06:03,723
(Homer and Marge sigh)

123
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:07,670
Oh, baby, I feel so
close to you right now.

124
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:10,746
(whistling a tune)

125
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:13,681
(clinking)

126
00:06:13,714 --> 00:06:14,477
(shrieks)

127
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:16,073
Hmm? Hmm?

128
00:06:16,106 --> 00:06:18,891
Marge? Did you replace
our regular mirror

129
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,664
with a magical mirror
from a mystical salesman

130
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,147
at a weird store that if
we went back to find it,

131
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:25,954
it wouldn't be
there anymore?

132
00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:27,928
- No.
- (screams)

133
00:06:31,285 --> 00:06:34,415
Okay, Homer, get a grip.
I'm sure lots of people,

134
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:38,302
every time they look in the mirror,
see a hideous flesh monster.

135
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:40,090
Just a one-time thing.

136
00:06:41,003 --> 00:06:41,684
(gasps)

137
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,069
Oh, brick me!

138
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:47,388
Leave me alone! Why don't you
go back where you came from!

139
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:49,695
I have as much right
to be here as you!

140
00:06:49,715 --> 00:06:52,659
I, sir, am in the
Advent calendar!

141
00:06:52,682 --> 00:06:54,769
- Hmm?
- APU: December 18,

142
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:56,681
final week! Huh?

143
00:06:57,988 --> 00:07:01,621
Moe, I'm going crazy... I need to kill off
as many of my brain cells as possible.

144
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:03,028
Well, I'm here to help.

145
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:04,293
(clinking)

146
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:06,736
(sputters)

147
00:07:06,764 --> 00:07:08,744
What the...?
This isn't beer.

148
00:07:08,764 --> 00:07:10,457
Beer is plastic circles.

149
00:07:10,474 --> 00:07:14,091
How can I drink...
(shudders) this?

150
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:14,997
(mug shatters)

151
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,996
Did you guys see... that?

152
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:18,996
Oh, it's getting worse!

153
00:07:19,028 --> 00:07:20,395
(shrieks)

154
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:22,780
(grumbling)

155
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,030
Ugh! Rebuilding the
same boring old school.

156
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,432
I could make this place so much
cooler if they just gave me a chance.

157
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,018
(yawns)

158
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:39,910
(snoring)

159
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:43,032
(sneaky chuckling)

160
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,066
(gasps)

161
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:45,951
What have you done
to my school?

162
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,604
I put in a rock-climbing wall, all
the classrooms are skate parks,

163
00:07:49,624 --> 00:07:53,143
we got zip-line stairwells,
Terminator gym teachers,

164
00:07:53,163 --> 00:07:58,409
your office is now a haunted forest... extra
ghosts... and, if you can believe it,

165
00:07:58,422 --> 00:08:00,389
two tetherball poles.

166
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:03,995
How will children learn if they don't
feel like they're in kid jail?

167
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:06,495
Relax. I used all
the same bricks.

168
00:08:06,522 --> 00:08:09,325
- Plus Ralph.
- <i>Yo soy</i> language lab.

169
00:08:09,346 --> 00:08:10,546
(groans)

170
00:08:12,482 --> 00:08:15,582
But I don't want to go to church...
I'm too busy going crazy.

171
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:18,149
Come on, Homie.
When I'm troubled,

172
00:08:18,176 --> 00:08:22,711
I always find solace in the
airtight logic of religion.

173
00:08:22,732 --> 00:08:27,297
"Before the world began,
there was only table.

174
00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:31,859
"Then the Great Constructor
scissored open bag one

175
00:08:31,885 --> 00:08:34,359
"and dumped out the universe.

176
00:08:34,378 --> 00:08:36,936
"Then came the time
of the Great Sorting:

177
00:08:36,956 --> 00:08:41,904
"Color to color, shape to shape, and
a pile of just windows and doors.

178
00:08:41,936 --> 00:08:45,690
"And everything was made
of eternal, unchanging

179
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:49,167
acrylonitrile
butadiene styrene,"

180
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,940
or in the common
tongue, "plastic."

181
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:55,034
But, Reverend, what if everything
<i>isn't</i> made of plastic?

182
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:57,092
I think there's
more to this world.

183
00:08:57,118 --> 00:09:00,149
You mean like decals? Well,
the Orthodox don't use them,

184
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:02,781
but we're a Reform
congregation.

185
00:09:05,106 --> 00:09:08,009
No. I mean a place where
nothing snaps together

186
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:11,116
and you just can't toss your kids
in a dishwasher to clean 'em.

187
00:09:11,145 --> 00:09:13,261
(chuckles): Oh, Homer,
a place like that

188
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,694
could only exist in some
kind of magic rock song.

189
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:18,764
Look around... we live
in a perfect world

190
00:09:18,784 --> 00:09:21,024
where everything fits together
and no one gets hurt.

191
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:22,164
Mustache is right.
(others agreeing)

192
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,223
But I'm having all
these hallucinations.

193
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:28,035
Like right now my hands look like
they're these weird wiggly things.

194
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:31,983
I think they have a name, but
I can't put my finger on it.

195
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:33,012
(congregation gasps)

196
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:34,101
Don't look, boys!

197
00:09:34,122 --> 00:09:35,335
(pop)

198
00:09:35,364 --> 00:09:37,231
Wait! You guys see them, too?

199
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,558
He's a freak!

200
00:09:38,593 --> 00:09:41,979
Take him apart and lose the
pieces under the couch!

201
00:09:42,003 --> 00:09:44,250
Well, I don't find
him disgusting.

202
00:09:44,273 --> 00:09:46,374
Oh, boy, that's mushy!

203
00:09:46,394 --> 00:09:48,167
Come on, Marge. We
need real answers,

204
00:09:48,203 --> 00:09:51,279
and there's only one
place we can get them!

205
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,366
Let's see, "fingers."

206
00:09:53,382 --> 00:09:56,684
Come on, show me
something about fingers.

207
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:57,842
(sighs)

208
00:09:57,867 --> 00:10:01,380
Bad news, people.
Our religion is not true.

209
00:10:01,403 --> 00:10:03,719
Sorry about that.
Really sorry.

210
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,327
If I'm right, when
I touch this box,

211
00:10:08,352 --> 00:10:11,339
it'll trigger another memory
from some alternate me's life.

212
00:10:11,358 --> 00:10:15,633
If I don't come back from that other
place, tell my wife I loved her.

213
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:16,889
I'm right here.

214
00:10:16,912 --> 00:10:18,901
Promise me!

215
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:22,066
(rumbling)

216
00:10:22,109 --> 00:10:25,109
I can't believe all the time
I wasted playing with Bart

217
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:27,167
when I could have
been playing with you.

218
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:28,335
Aw...

219
00:10:28,357 --> 00:10:31,393
Our little Springfield is
really turning out great.

220
00:10:31,426 --> 00:10:34,833
City Hall, the weird-smelling
bank, Rehab World...

221
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,069
Krustyburger,
Krustyburger Express,

222
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,208
the Krustyburger where
the governor got stabbed...

223
00:10:39,226 --> 00:10:41,300
Oh, you two.

224
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,052
Hey, look what I found in
the "Arts-Weekend-Obituary"

225
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,650
section
of the paper.

226
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:47,823
LISA (gasps):
A builders competition!

227
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:49,456
We got to enter
our mini-Springfield.

228
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:50,924
We're a great team!

229
00:10:50,944 --> 00:10:53,334
We're there.
I'll clear my calendar.

230
00:10:54,782 --> 00:10:57,482
Hey, Lenny, remember those two
surfers we were gonna fight?

231
00:10:57,501 --> 00:10:58,455
Well, you're on your own.

232
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,495
<i>But you're the one who
sat on their fish tacos.</i>

233
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:02,262
Great talking
to you, buddy.

234
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:03,441
(chuckles)

235
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,513
Lisa, Lisa, I spent
all day at work

236
00:11:08,532 --> 00:11:11,447
making a Duff brewery
for our mini-Springfield.

237
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:14,763
I don't want to brag, but...
it really brews.

238
00:11:16,004 --> 00:11:18,084
Huh? Where is she?

239
00:11:18,113 --> 00:11:22,839
Okay, I got us tickets for the
7:30 show of <i>Survival Games.</i>

240
00:11:22,863 --> 00:11:25,490
I've never been to a
PG-13 movie before.

241
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:28,497
I wonder what the one
swear word will be.

242
00:11:28,517 --> 00:11:29,572
What if it's...

243
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:31,038
- (whispering)
- (gasps)

244
00:11:31,063 --> 00:11:33,923
Oh, I've never
heard that one.

245
00:11:33,936 --> 00:11:36,197
My grampa said it
at Thanksgiving.

246
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:38,818
We usually don't hang out
with second graders,

247
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,855
but we saw your <i>Survival
Games</i> book report

248
00:11:40,882 --> 00:11:44,222
hanging in the hallway, and
we were very impressed.

249
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:47,924
You really understood that the
theme of the book was love.

250
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,039
Hey, older girls,
I'm Homer Simpson.

251
00:11:50,064 --> 00:11:53,258
That's right. Lisa's
playtime partner and BFF.

252
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:55,508
(girls groaning)

253
00:11:55,537 --> 00:11:59,053
I assume Lisa told you about
the pretend tiny town

254
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:01,965
she's building with her
overweight father.

255
00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:04,802
Oh, yeah, it's gonna
be mucho fresh.

256
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:08,269
Come on, honey. It's time
to click some bricks.

257
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,302
I don't know what
he's doing up here.

258
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:13,400
He usually stays
in the basement.

259
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:15,869
It's okay, Lisa.
We have dads, too.

260
00:12:15,884 --> 00:12:17,851
I have three dads.

261
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,564
See you Friday.

262
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:22,528
Friday? But that's
when Brick-Stock is.

263
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:28,703
Um, actually, Friday is the opening
night of the new <i>Survival Games</i> movie,

264
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:30,056
and they invited me.

265
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:32,458
But this was <i>our</i> thing.

266
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:33,953
I know. I'm sorry,

267
00:12:33,982 --> 00:12:37,578
but cool older girls have never
wanted to hang out with me before.

268
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:39,571
One of them wears
deodorant.

269
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:40,786
I don't know which one.

270
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:43,050
Oh.
All right.

271
00:12:43,084 --> 00:12:45,372
Thanks for
understanding, Dad.

272
00:12:46,968 --> 00:12:48,755
What just happened?

273
00:12:48,777 --> 00:12:51,297
It's not you.
Lisa's growing up.

274
00:12:51,323 --> 00:12:55,416
It's a really complicated time in a
girl's life from age eight to...

275
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:57,636
actually, all the
rest of the way.

276
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:02,719
Oh! I finally found something I like doing
with my daughter, and now I've lost it.

277
00:13:02,737 --> 00:13:05,059
I don't fit
into her world.

278
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:07,086
This is for the tacos!

279
00:13:07,112 --> 00:13:08,308
Ow!

280
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:11,786
Tacos, brah! Ow!

281
00:13:18,752 --> 00:13:20,878
- What did you build?
- Mmm...

282
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:25,756
Oh, that's the teenage crossbow ace
who stole my daughter from me.

283
00:13:25,782 --> 00:13:28,557
Keendah Wildwill is a
modern feminist hero...

284
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:30,856
strong, independent
and resourceful.

285
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:34,076
She's a little... bustier
than I remember.

286
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:36,436
My work on that front
is never done.

287
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:45,765
I wish I lived in
little Springfield.

288
00:13:45,786 --> 00:13:49,767
Everything fits together,
and no one ever gets hurt.

289
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:54,371
- (yells)
- (groans)

290
00:13:56,437 --> 00:13:57,777
COMIC BOOK GUY:
<i>Okay...</i>

291
00:13:57,793 --> 00:14:00,306
Apparently, our whole world
is a fantasy in the mind

292
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:02,876
of an emotionally-devastated
Homer Simpson.

293
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:06,427
One of the main questions
I have about that is, why?

294
00:14:06,448 --> 00:14:08,881
The real Homer fears losing
his daughter's love,

295
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:12,603
so he invented this toy world
where nothing will ever change.

296
00:14:12,627 --> 00:14:13,896
How can you be sure?

297
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,497
I have devoted my life to
second-rate science fiction.

298
00:14:16,518 --> 00:14:19,019
Trust me, that is what
we are dealing with here.

299
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:21,451
So if I don't find
my way out of here,

300
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,895
I could be trapped
in a fantasy forever?

301
00:14:24,922 --> 00:14:26,342
I'm afraid so.

302
00:14:26,706 --> 00:14:27,467
(whooping)

303
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:29,600
I'm trapped in a
fantasy forever!

304
00:14:29,624 --> 00:14:32,672
Kiss my flat plastic
butt, reality.

305
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:34,815
(giggling)

306
00:14:35,223 --> 00:14:36,056
Ooh.

307
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:38,937
Daddy-daughter time
will never end!

308
00:14:42,103 --> 00:14:44,954
Inventing this toy world to
live in is the smartest thing

309
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,222
my brain-damaged
brain ever did.

310
00:14:47,244 --> 00:14:49,854
Nothing bad can
ever happen here.

311
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:53,333
Great throw, Homer.

312
00:14:56,084 --> 00:14:57,821
Put it in Tupperware, boys.

313
00:14:57,841 --> 00:15:00,210
We'll rebuild it tomorrow.

314
00:15:00,243 --> 00:15:01,583
Homie, ask yourself...

315
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:05,557
can you really live in a paradise
if you know it's just pretend?

316
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:11,526
Marge, who would give up eating steak
in the Matrix to go slurp goo in Zion?

317
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,374
We don't have
that movie here.

318
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:18,263
Now Lisa can never ditch me, and
I can play with her forever.

319
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,390
(sighs)

320
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:23,576
There, I finished.
All 12 of them.

321
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,860
I'll never build
what I want again.

322
00:15:25,882 --> 00:15:27,529
Then you've learned
your lesson.

323
00:15:27,555 --> 00:15:29,529
Too bad I got these
for my birthday.

324
00:15:29,552 --> 00:15:31,639
They always give
me the school.

325
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:33,093
(groans)

326
00:15:34,156 --> 00:15:37,163
Sparkle Unicorn, would
like some more tea?

327
00:15:37,182 --> 00:15:42,101
Oh, yeah, hook me up with some
more of that imaginary nectar.

328
00:15:42,113 --> 00:15:45,395
I've never seen you throw yourself
into a tea party like this.

329
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:48,453
Before, it always seemed like
you were kind of phoning it in.

330
00:15:48,484 --> 00:15:49,691
Not anymore, Lisa.

331
00:15:49,704 --> 00:15:55,136
I've created a perfect world with no
PG-13 movies to take you away from me.

332
00:15:55,158 --> 00:15:56,370
(sips loudly)

333
00:15:56,403 --> 00:15:57,557
Ah!

334
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:01,375
'Cause in a toy town, everything
stays shiny and wonderful,

335
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,137
just the way I want it.

336
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:05,205
You'll always be
my little girl.

337
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,877
Maggie will always
be my giant baby.

338
00:16:07,896 --> 00:16:09,910
Bart will never move
out of the house.

339
00:16:09,926 --> 00:16:12,653
I'll work for Mr.
Burns forever.

340
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:16,897
Marge and I will never grow old together
and live like fat cats on Social Security.

341
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:21,903
Good Lord, I'll never experience the
ultimate reward for a life well lived...

342
00:16:21,938 --> 00:16:25,140
the gentle slumber
of death.

343
00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:27,020
Marge, I made a
terrible mistake!

344
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,387
The fact that kids grow up is what
makes time with them special.

345
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,227
I think I need to go back.

346
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:35,347
I wish you'd told me that before
I bought all these groceries.

347
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,190
But I understand.

348
00:16:37,203 --> 00:16:40,724
Lego Marge, you're just
as cool as Real Marge.

349
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,663
- Who?!
- Nobody, nobody.

350
00:16:42,684 --> 00:16:45,131
Plastic Comic Book Guy,
I need to go back home.

351
00:16:45,154 --> 00:16:48,030
Home? But you've discovered
the joy of living in a world

352
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,836
made of toys where nothing
bad can ever happen.

353
00:16:52,921 --> 00:16:56,201
But I miss burning
my mouth on pizza,

354
00:16:56,227 --> 00:17:00,356
and David Blaine stunts
where he could really die.

355
00:17:00,381 --> 00:17:02,229
Now tell me how to
get out of here!

356
00:17:02,258 --> 00:17:06,538
All you need to do is open the box
back to your so-called reality.

357
00:17:06,555 --> 00:17:09,890
But I can't let
that happen.

358
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,567
Huh? You're the bad guy?

359
00:17:13,593 --> 00:17:15,660
I thought you were the
rule-explainer guy.

360
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,476
As an adult who surrounds
himself with child's toys,

361
00:17:18,489 --> 00:17:22,336
I represent the part of your psyche
that prefers <i>this</i> artificial world.

362
00:17:22,365 --> 00:17:25,258
(rhythmic clicking,
gate clangs shut)

363
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:26,808
How did you do that?!

364
00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:33,105
Because, as the ultimate collector,
I have every play set ever made.

365
00:17:33,735 --> 00:17:34,708
(creaking)
Huh?

366
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:36,433
(gasps) Pirates!

367
00:17:37,513 --> 00:17:38,620
(whooshing, grunting)

368
00:17:38,648 --> 00:17:40,549
Pajama guys!

369
00:17:42,118 --> 00:17:42,975
(gasps)

370
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,713
I'll never get home. Who could build
something awesome enough to save me?

371
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,013
Who?

372
00:17:48,036 --> 00:17:51,636
Who?! Who?!

373
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,446
Don't you even think about it.

374
00:17:53,468 --> 00:17:55,339
(whirring)

375
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,233
You are thinking about
it, aren't you?

376
00:17:58,835 --> 00:17:59,788
(whimpering)

377
00:17:59,802 --> 00:18:01,036
(loud, rhythmic thudding)

378
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:11,628
You are going back
where you came from...

379
00:18:11,654 --> 00:18:12,661
Denmark.

380
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,202
What is that thing?

381
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:17,356
I have no idea, but it's
gonna kick his butt.

382
00:18:17,386 --> 00:18:19,268
That robot is made
out of Batmobile,

383
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:21,469
Hobbit Hole and
SpongeBob play sets.

384
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:24,131
That's... that's
mis-set-genation.

385
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:25,605
(in robotic voice):
Kid power.

386
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:27,936
BART: Lion blast!
(whirring, rapid gunfire)

387
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:31,005
Lightsaber barf!

388
00:18:31,033 --> 00:18:33,401
(click, whirring, whooshing)

389
00:18:36,572 --> 00:18:38,535
Fire Principal!

390
00:18:39,229 --> 00:18:41,414
This is strangely
exhilarating.

391
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:44,240
No. No.
(crying): No!

392
00:18:45,214 --> 00:18:49,343
I am going to enjoy playing
with this thing forever!

393
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:50,393
(Bart grunting)

394
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:53,412
I'm a creative but
undisciplined builder!

395
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,467
(Homer grunts,
Comic Book Guy groans)

396
00:19:00,488 --> 00:19:02,223
(anxious whimpering)

397
00:19:04,573 --> 00:19:06,474
(magical whirring)

398
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:08,637
Good-bye, Homie.

399
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:12,994
Your squishy meat family is lucky
to have a good man like you.

400
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:17,832
Oh, baby, no matter what the reality,
you're the best thing in it.

401
00:19:21,236 --> 00:19:24,319
Hmm. That was a
little weird, right?

402
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:25,485
(laughs)

403
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:26,861
A little bit.

404
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:28,680
(whirring)

405
00:19:29,312 --> 00:19:30,779
(yelling)

406
00:19:32,514 --> 00:19:34,174
LISA:
Dad, wake up.

407
00:19:34,202 --> 00:19:35,803
Wake up.

408
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,871
Oh, Meat Lisa, it's you.

409
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,291
Are you okay?

410
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,641
Oh, I had this crazy dream where I
was in a world made of Lego bricks

411
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:51,700
and learned important
lessons about parenting.

412
00:19:51,713 --> 00:19:53,933
Mmm, isn't that kind of
the plot of the...?

413
00:19:53,955 --> 00:19:56,911
No. No, it's not.
It's a <i>new</i> plot.

414
00:19:56,932 --> 00:19:59,812
Honey, what are you doing here? I
thought you were going to your movie.

415
00:19:59,835 --> 00:20:03,182
I changed my mind. I knew
how much this meant to you.

416
00:20:03,195 --> 00:20:05,625
No, no, go to the movie
with your friends.

417
00:20:05,642 --> 00:20:10,159
If there's one thing I've learned, it's
that I can't stop you from growing up.

418
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:11,849
I love you, Dad.

419
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:13,744
Me, too, little girl.

420
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,431
♪ ♪

421
00:20:47,428 --> 00:20:50,730
Thayson, Joshuel, don't make
me pick between you two

422
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,586
on the night before I reenter
the Struggle Dome again.

423
00:20:53,614 --> 00:20:57,614
We'll never stop loving you, even
if you string us along forever.

424
00:20:57,638 --> 00:20:59,706
- Forever.
- Forever.

425
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:04,219
How can I choose between two boys, one
who's dangerous but good-looking,

426
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:06,724
the other who's strong
but super cute?

427

ALL (sighing):
Ah!

428
00:21:08,455 --> 00:21:11,475
Oh, my God, this
is terrible.

429
00:21:11,508 --> 00:21:13,813
When do they get to
killing the children?

430
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:14,880
Shh!

431
00:21:14,895 --> 00:21:16,849
Wait a second.
You're not into this...

432
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:19,936
Shh! She's trying
on dresses.

433

fight to the death, is all.
