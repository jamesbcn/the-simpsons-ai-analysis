"make it fun."

95
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:56,205
Well, he said that to us, too,

96
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:58,205
but we didn't believe him.

97
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:00,349

never to believe him.

Mmm, mmm, ooh.

105
00:04:20,153 --> 00:04:22,893

106
00:04:23,026 --> 00:04:24,556

107
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:26,773
Nothing makes sense anymore.

108
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,337

this is our car.

109

110
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:34,379
Black? Uh...

111
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:36,751
No, no, no,

How is it everyone else
saw the best in Bart

113
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,959
and we didn't?

114
00:04:40,962 --> 00:04:43,772
Are we horrible parents?

115
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:47,267

120
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:04,741
We're horrible parents.

121
00:05:04,843 --> 00:05:06,053
It's not our fault.

We weren't planning on starting
a family when we had him.

126
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:16,733
What if, deep down,

127
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:19,814
we blame Bart for throwing
our lives out of whack?

128
00:05:19,806 --> 00:05:22,106
That's the thing
no one ever tells you:

129
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,150
having kids changes your life.

130
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,390
I just wish so much

131
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:29,657
that we could see him
like other people do,

132
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:33,969

of ten years of parenting him.

133

00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,919
And the sex-mobile
could be an ambulance.

360
00:16:17,922 --> 00:16:19,592
"Eat my shorts."

361
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:23,532
Still don't know what it means,
but it really works.

362
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:26,909
Hey, Jitters.
What you working on?

363
00:16:27,006 --> 00:16:28,306
I'm doing a diorama

364
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:30,449
on the history of homework.

365
00:16:30,547 --> 00:16:33,147
Did you know that
in ancient Assyria,

366
00:16:33,252 --> 00:16:35,122
novice scribes had to get...

367
00:16:35,122 --> 00:16:37,392
Oh, it's Friday, nerd.

368
00:16:37,393 --> 00:16:39,573
Put down the tweezers
and live a little.

369
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,265
W-wait, let me just
finish the detailing

370
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:43,308
on this Trapper Keeper
because then I...

371
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:45,175
When I need to relax,
I like to watch

372
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:46,746
a little <i>Itchy and Scratchy.</i>

373
00:16:46,846 --> 00:16:48,416
Yeah, I've seen the lunch boxes.

374
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:49,415
It's not for me.

375
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:50,587
You'll love it.

376
00:16:50,587 --> 00:16:51,657
It's about a cat and a mouse

377
00:16:51,656 --> 00:16:52,856
trying to kill each other.

378
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,298
You know... the human experience.

379
00:16:55,296 --> 00:16:58,466

Have you ever heard
Lisa make that sound?

382
00:17:50,807 --> 00:17:52,307
I've heard her laugh before,

383
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,780
but it's always been ironic.
Or sarcastic.

384
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,192
Or dubiously polite and
just a little bit put-upon.

385
00:17:58,188 --> 00:18:00,758
(laughing continuing)

386
00:18:00,761 --> 00:18:02,771
But never that.

387
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:03,925
- Aw.
- Aw.

388
00:18:04,034 --> 00:18:07,414
Once again, cartoon violence
and mental health

389
00:18:07,407 --> 00:18:09,677
go hand in hand.

390
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:12,849
So, how late
did you two crazy kids

391
00:18:12,952 --> 00:18:14,492
stay up watching cartoons?

392
00:18:14,588 --> 00:18:17,028
I don't know,
but all the ads on TV

393
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:18,326
were about calling women

394
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:21,639
who couldn't wait
to talk to us right now.

395
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:23,536
I'm glad you had fun.

396
00:18:24,675 --> 00:18:25,835
Well, that's odd.

397
00:18:25,944 --> 00:18:27,854
Maggie never
liked that book before.

398
00:18:27,948 --> 00:18:29,418
I zazzed it up for her.

399
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:36,569
Oh, you wrote Maggie
into the story.

400
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,466
What a special
little guy you are.

401
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:42,541
Eh, no way.
I just wanted to deface a book.

402
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:45,453
Sure you did.

403
00:18:47,621 --> 00:18:48,791
Morning, folks.

404
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,730
Why'd you break down our door?

405
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:52,727
Oh, we do that for everyone now.

406
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:53,731
So, good news.

407
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:56,643
I'm taking Bart away forever.
(chuckles)

408
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,509
Oh. So you figured
out where he's from?

409
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:01,682
No, but I went
to the courthouse,

410
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:03,253
and one of those, uh, uh,

411
00:19:03,252 --> 00:19:05,562
robe-and-gavel guys
said to dump him

412
00:19:05,691 --> 00:19:08,461
at the Springfield
Maximum Security Orphanage.

413
00:19:08,462 --> 00:19:10,932
Uh, it used to be a prison,
but don't worry.

414
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:13,614
None of the old guards
lost their jobs.

415
00:19:13,707 --> 00:19:16,647
You know, we could hang on
to Bart for a little while,

416
00:19:16,646 --> 00:19:18,916
if you want to
keep working on his case.

417
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:20,217
No, thank you.

418
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:24,031
Oh, hey, don't worry about it.

419
00:19:24,027 --> 00:19:25,757
I knew this was
a short-term gig,

420
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,644
and I'll always have
something to remember you by.

421
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:31,739
Why you little...

422
00:19:32,745 --> 00:19:35,445
Adios, losers.

423
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:37,249
Next time you see
a mouse kill a cat

424
00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:39,733
in a way you never thought
possible, think of me.

425
00:19:39,725 --> 00:19:41,395
I will.

426
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:50,445
Bart! Come back!

427
00:19:50,547 --> 00:19:53,317
We like you.
God help us, we like you.

428
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:55,919
We like you so much.

429
00:19:56,926 --> 00:19:58,296
Stop!

430
00:19:58,295 --> 00:19:59,895
Don't take him!

431
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:14,058
You're still here.

432
00:20:14,194 --> 00:20:15,904
My beautiful, wonderful boy

433
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:17,937
is still here.

434
00:20:19,104 --> 00:20:20,374
(grunts)
Ow.

435
00:20:20,372 --> 00:20:22,012
What the hell?
Get off.

436
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,410
I'm sorry, son.

437
00:20:23,412 --> 00:20:26,822
We just couldn't wait
to tell you something.

438
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:28,759
We like you.

439
00:20:28,757 --> 00:20:30,957
We like our son so much.

440
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:32,931
We just realized.

441
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,541
Mm, I like you guys, too.

442
00:20:35,336 --> 00:20:38,576
Wait. What do you mean,
you just realized?

Just put down the purple crayon.
