interest in anything he does?

56
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,913
No. Well, we used
to have burping contests

get closer to him

59
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,334
maybe you should bridge the gap.

60
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,082

61

watched the game together?

I was thinking that while
your father and Lisa watch the game,

85
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,089
it might be fun if the two of us
went clothes shopping.

86
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,224
Mom, I'd love to, but to be honest,
I don't need new clothes.

Oh, really?

88
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,768

I'd love to spend

Because the people

00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,148
You mean you made a bet?

179
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,230
I wouldn't call it a bet.

180
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,065
It's a little thing
Daddies do

181
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,360
to make football
more exciting.

182
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,993
What could
be more exciting

183
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,860
than the savage ballet
that is pro football?

184
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,158
Well, you know.

185
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,991
You like ice cream,
don't you?

186
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,116
Uh-huh.

187
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,372
Don't you like
ice cream better

188
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,083
when it's covered
with hot fudge

189
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:57,833
and mounds of whipped cream,
chopped nuts

190
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,797
and those crumbled-up
cookie things they mash up?

191
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,168
Mmm...

192
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,005
Crumbled-up cookie things.

193
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,760
So gambling makes a
good thing even better?

194
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,433
That's right!

195
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,221
My God...

196
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,014
it's like there's
some kind of bond between us.

197
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,057
Hmm?

198
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,369
We've got a troublemaker
in booth eight.

199
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,200
Forget him.
There's a code red in booth three.

200
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,576
My God!

201
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,212
Those aren't the socks
she came in with.

202
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,329
Um-um...Let's move.

203
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,464
-Bart?
-In here Mom, but Don't open the--

204
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,877
-(screaming)
-(giggling)

205
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,046
Oh, Bart, you could use
some new underwear too.

206
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,006
MAN:
Look at that stupid kid!

207
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,057
-Three!
-Three!

208
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,060
-Two!
-Two!

209
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,681
-One!
-One!

210
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,057
ANNOUNCER: <i>And the final</i>
<i>from Riverfront Stadium:</i>

211
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,515
<i>Miami 24, Cincinnati 10.</i>

212
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,016
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

213
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,897
Boy! Mom sure will
be happy you won $50.

214
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,565
You'd think that,
wouldn't you?

215
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,623
But you see, Lisa,
your mother has this crazy idea

216
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,118
that gambling is wrong

217
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,120
even though they
say it's okay in the Bible.

218
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,542
Really? Where?

219
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,660
Uh... somewhere in the back.

220
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,827
The point is,
we had a great time today.

221
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,627
And to keep it that way

222
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,670
let's not tell your mother
about our little wager, okay?

223
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,795
Okay, Dad.

224
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,301
Did you two
have fun?

225
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,842
You bet.

226
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,006
(giggling)

227
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,433
Well, we had fun too.

228
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,472
Right now,
Bart is modeling his new clothes

229
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,675
for his friends.

230
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,725
Ooh...

231
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,558
You got to come out
sometime, Simpson.

232
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,856
Goodnight, Dad.
I had a really nice time today.

233
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,783
Me too, honey.

234
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,901
Can I watch football
with you

235
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,317
again next Sunday?

236
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,735
Sure. You'll find
it gets rid

237
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,163
of the unpleasant aftertaste
of church.

238
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,583
See how good things can happen

239
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,251
if you make
a little effort?

240
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,659
Point well taken.

241
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,827
Uh, Mom... could you loosen
my blanket a little?

242
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,667
Dad tucked me in too tight,
and it's cutting off

243
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,172
the circulation
in my arms and legs.

244
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,295
<i>This team is fired up.</i>
<i>We came here to play.</i>

245
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,092
-Alright!
-He'll lose.

246
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:13,005
What? Didn't you hear
what he said?

247
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,474
Look at the fear in his eyes.

248
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,264
Listen to the quiver
in his voice.

249
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,057
He's a little boy
lost in a game of men.

250
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,521
Do you think we should
bet against them?

251
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,351
I'd bet my entire
college fund on it.

252
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,346
You got it.

253
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:27,147
Moe, $23 on New York.

254
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,993
MAN:
<i>Start spreading the news.</i>

255
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,988
<i>It's New York over</i>
<i>Philadelphia, 35 to 10.</i>

256
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,911
-Yay!
-Yay!

257
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,492
Dad, I hate
to break the mood

258
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,617
but I'm
getting nauseous.

259
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,913
Oh, sorry.

260
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,117
So, who do you like
in the afternoon games?

261
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,917
Well, I like the 49ers
because they're pure of heart,

262
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,632
Seattle because they got
something to prove,

263
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,803
and the Raiders
because they always cheat.

264
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,971
<i>In an extremely suspicious play</i>

265
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,640
<i>the Raiders win!</i>

266
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,099
Three for three!

267
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,436
Hey, the new sign's
really working.

268
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,650
It's been
a madhouse, Lisa.

269
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,941
Let's see...

270
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,114
Football... football...

271
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,782
homoeroticism in...

272
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,531
oddball Canadian rules...

273
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,623
Phyllis George in...

274
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,828
<i>Oh, doctor,</i>
<i>what a finish!</i>

275
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:21,368
<i>The final score--</i>
<i>Atlanta 17, Houston 13.</i>

276
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,664
<i>and the lowly Falcons</i>
<i>are flying high.</i>

277
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,667
<i>Who would have thunk it?</i>

278
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,789
My daughter, that's who.

279
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,166
Yeah, me.

280
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,752
Lisa, you pick the winner
every time.

281
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,127
You must have some kind
of special gift.

282
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,974
Come on Dad. It doesn't
take a genius

283
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,430
to realize that Houston's failed
to cover their last ten outings

284
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,680
on away turf the week
after scoring more

285
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,683
than three touchdowns
in a conference game.

286
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,595
My little girl
says the cutest things.

287
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,854
You know, Dad,
Sunday is fast becoming

288
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,476
my favorite day
of the week.

289
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:51,233
Not Sunday--
Daddy-Daughter Day.

290
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,147
The usual, Moe--

291
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,985
a beer...
and a wad of bills!

292
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,662
Okay...

293
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,410
(quietly)
You lucky moron.

294
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,537
Here you go, Homer, $135.

295
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:09,383
I used to hate the smell
of your sweaty feet.

296
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,800
Now it's the smell
of victory.

297
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,799
Oh, shut up.

298
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,220
(Marge gasps)

299
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,178
Look at these prices.
We could finally get rid

300
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,219
of those termites
for the cost of this meal.

301
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,813
Tut-tut, only the best
for my family.

302
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,639
Homer, I can't help wondering
where you're getting the money from?

303
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:28,145
Mom, can't a man do something
nice for his loved ones?

304
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,479
I guess so.

305
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,523
(both laughing)

306
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,147
Hello, I'm Marco,
I'll be your waiter.

307
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,534
Hello, I'm Homer,
I'll be your customer.

308
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,911
(all laughing)

309
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,408
Never heard that one before.

310
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,490
Would you care
to select the wine?

311
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,485
I'll do the honors.

312
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,787
No, no, no, no.

313
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,211
My God!

314
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,249
What passes for
a wine list these days?

315
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,963
Marco, just bring us your
freshest bottle of wine.

316
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,673
Chop, chop.
(all giggle)

317
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:57,594
Charming lad.

318
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,045
Oh, violin guy.

319
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,675
What's your favorite song,
Lisa?

320
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,682
-"The Broken Neck Blues."
-Play on.

321
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:08,595
(playing "Broken Neck Blues")

322
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,568
ANNOUNCER:
<i>It is the playoffs.</i>

323
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,439
<i>It's five below.</i>

324
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,236
<i>and there's one loyal fan</i>
<i>wearing nothing but a G-string.</i>

325
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,659
<i>And the team colors</i>
<i>painted on his body.</i>

326
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,579
ANNOUNCER 2:
<i>He doesn't look too happy.</i>

327
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,488
ANNOUNCER: <i>Well, maybe the paint has shut</i>
<i>off his pores and he's slowly suffocating.</i>

328
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,497
<i>Still, that is a real fan.</i>

329
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,209
Well Lisa, it's
Daddy-Daughter Day,

330
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,709
and Daddy needs
daughter's picks.

331
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,130
Dad, I'm making the Chiefs

332
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,668
my five-star,
silver bullet special.

333
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,423
And with your blessing,
I'd like to tie it to the Cowboys

334
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,505
plus five at Chicago.

335
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,720
Good, good. You call Moe.

336
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,351
Moe, this is L.S.
calling for H.S.

337
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,719
Just give me the bet, Lisa.

338
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,015
110, 120...

339
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,559
You lucky son of a...

340
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,022
Hey Homer, you want to go
bowling next Sunday?

341
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,772
Barney, are you nuts?
That's the Super Bowl.

342
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,435
How about the Sunday
after that?

343
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,283
Well, my ma's coming in
from Norway

344
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,488
but what the hell.
(belching)

345
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,609
And when the doctor said
I didn't have worms anymore,

346
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,947
that was the happiest day
of my life.

347
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,913
Thank you, Ralph,
very graphic.

348
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:09,963
Lisa Simpson, would you like
to read your essay?

349
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,539
The happiest day of my life
was three Sundays ago

350
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,416
I was sitting on my Daddy's
knee when the Saints--

351
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,924
who are four and a half point favorites,
but only up by three--

352
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,626
kicked a meaningless field goal

353
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,636
at the last second
to cover the spread.

354
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,928
Dear God!

355
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,431
Oh, Dad!
You must have bought me

356
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,715
every Malibu Stacy
accessory there is.

357
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,228
Not quite.

358
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,189
They were out
of Malibu Stacy lunar rovers.

359
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,979
Ooh, perfume!

360
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,574
"Meryl Streep's Versatility."

361
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,032
Boy, I know you're going
to like your present.

362
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,775
<i>Shut up! Shut up!</i>
<i>Kiss my butt!</i>

363
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,367
<i>Shut up!</i>
<i>Go to hell! Go to hell!</i>

364
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,332
Dad, I promise you,

365
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,502
I will never get tired of this.

366
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,671
Homer, those were
very thoughtful presents

367
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,751
but you have to tell me
where you got the money from.

368
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,258
Alright Marge, I'll tell you,

369
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,299
but first you have to
promise you will not get mad.

370
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,883
I promise I will get mad

371
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,588
because I always do when you
make me promise I won't.

372
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,218
Alright, if you must know,

373
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,814
Lisa and I have been gambling
on pro football.

374
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,019
Homer!

375
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,389
You promised
you wouldn't get mad.

376
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,885
I did not.
I promised I would get mad.

377
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,937
She's an
eight-year-old girl!

378
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,820
Marge, she never loses.
She's got a gift.

379
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,858
Aren't parents supposed
to encourage their kids

380
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:20,992
whenever they show talent?

381
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,818
But gambling is illegal.

382
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,533
Oh, only in 48 states.

383
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,623
Besides,
it's a victimless crime.

384
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,829
The only victim is Moe

385
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,619
and it's brought
Lisa and me together.

386
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,914
I just don't know.

387
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,497
Look, what's the problem?

388
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,832
The kids are happy,
you smell like Meryl Streep

389
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,837
and I got that foot massager
I've always wanted.

390
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,970
Believe me, Marge, nothing bad
could possibly come of this.

391
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,799
You know, Dad,

392
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,755
we've been watching
a lot of TV lately.

393
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,715
Maybe the Sunday
after the Super Bowl

394
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,635
we could hike up to
the top of Mt. Springfield.

395
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,394
The fires in the tire yards
really make for some beautiful sunsets.

396
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:58,056
That sounds great honey, but next
Sunday I'm going bowling with Barney.

397
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,187
What about
Daddy-Daughter Day?

398
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,034
Don't worry. The new football season
is only seven months away.

399
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,320
So that's it.

400
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,413
You just wanted me
to help you gamble.

401
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,328
You never wanted
to be with me at all.

402
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,288
(sobbing)

403
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,159
You're a very selfish man.

404
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,787
<i>Go to hell!</i>
<i>Go to hell!</i>

405
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,884
Hey, once again,
great present, Dad.

406
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,340
Uh... uh...

407
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,680
My third husband bought me this.

408
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,602
Give me some chips for it.

409
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,930
Are you sure Ma'am?

410
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,345
Don't tell me
what to do Sonny.

411
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,983
I've been gambling
since I was eight

412
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,770
and I've been hocking jewelry
since I was 12.

413
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:39,864
Now give me some chips.

414
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,439
(gasps)

415
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,906
Look around you, Malibu Stacy.

416
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,698
All this was bought
with dirty money.

417
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:54,332
Your penthouse, your Alfa-Romeo,
your collagen-injection clinic.

418
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,331
You're going back
into the shoebox.

419
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,463
It may not be pretty

420
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,919
but damn it, it's honest.

421
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,958
I, Lisa Simpson

422
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,087
am hereby giving away

423
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:11,394
all my ill-gotten
Malibu Stacy accessories!

424
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,010
(screaming)

425
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,217
Ahh!

426
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,015
(clamoring)

427
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,942
Look Lisa, I bought you

428
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,645
a Malibu Stacy
chinchilla coat.

429
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,145
-Ooh!
-Huh?

430
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,107
So you've come to buy
my forgiveness.

431
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,737
Sorry, Homer.

432
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,874
Lisa, honey, I'm sorry
I hurt your feelings.

433
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,291
but I really had a good time
watching football with you

434
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,831
and I think you had
a good time with me.

435
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,875
Yeah, I did.

436
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,589
Well, come on, we can still
watch the Super Bowl together

437
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,879
can't we? Huh?

438
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,553
(both giggling)

439
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:50,051
Well, I would like to see
what the fuss is about.

440
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,644
It's a date.

441
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,049
So...

442
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,808
Do you think the Redskins
will beat the spread?

443
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,310
Put me down.

444
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:03,363
Look Dad, I'll tell you who's going
to win the Super Bowl if you want me to,

445
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,069
but it will just
validate my theory

446
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,609
that you cared more
about winning money

447
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,532
than you did about me.

448
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,820
Okay.

449
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,703
I think Washington
is a mortal lock.

450
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,780
Washington!
Whoo-hoo!

451
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,576
However...

452
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,699
However? What however?
What do you mean 'however'?

453
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,155
However what?

454
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,785
However, I may also be
so clouded with rage

455
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,424
that subconsciously
I want you to lose.

456
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,761
In which case,
I'd bet the farm on Buffalo.

457
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,968
Lisa, do me a favor.
Complete this sentence:

458
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,549
Daddy should bet
all his money on...

459
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,604
-I don't know.
-Oh!

460
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,428
If I still love you,
Washington.

461
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,773
If I don't, Buffalo.

462
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:46,613
Homer, I think that chip's
got enough dip on it.

463
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,362
<i>We're live from the</i>
<i>Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome</i>

464
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,105

(Lisa playing
"Broken Neck Blues")

474
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,062
Oh, every note is
like a dagger in my heart.

475
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,230
I got to get out of here.

476
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,598
Moe's Tavern.

477
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,604
Home of the Super Sunday
Brunch Spectacular.

478
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,516
Ohh! Baloney.

479
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,225
Bread!

480
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,775
Got you down for 40 bucks.

481
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,778
Good luck, Your Eminence.

482
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,950
Sorry, Homer, you can't take
any more of my money.

483
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,619
I'm out of the bookie
business.

484
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,528
But Moe,
you've been taking bets all...

485
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,577
-Hey, Barney, how 'bout a free beer.
-Wow!

486
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,292
Don't worry, Moe,
I'm not betting.

487
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,002
-What? Give me that.
-Aw.

488
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,343
I had the greatest gift
of all--

489
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,838
a little girl who
could pick football--

490
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,760
and I ruined it.

491
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,169
<i>Well, sir, we're two hours</i>

00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,095
<i>coincidentally enough,</i>
<i>right after the game!</i>

497
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,772
<i>Thanks, Bret.</i>

498
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,391
<i>My new show's called</i>

503
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,073
<i>Well I fell in love</i>

504
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,704

00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,495

525
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,169
Oh, this sucks.

526
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,208
Come on, snipers,
where are you?

527
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,542
Bart, who's winning?

528
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,497
You-hate-Dad is up
by a touchdown.

529
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,957
(sighing)

530
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,047
ALL:
Go! Go! Go! Go! Yay!

531
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:21,893
ANNOUNCER: <i>It's a touchdown</i>
<i>for halfback Dan Beerdorf.</i>

532
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,930
<i>Duff Dry has won the Duff Bowl.</i>

533
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,729
They wanted it more.

534
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,979
Hey, Homer, didn't you say
if Duff Dry wins,

535
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:30,982
your daughter loves you?

536
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,273
Not Duff Dry,
Washington.

537
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,567
Okay, okay,
they're both great teams.

538
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,571
-Yay!
-Yay!

539
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,072
Huh?

540
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,863
<i>Touchdown, Redskins.</i>

541
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,617
All right,
we're back in business.

542
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,906
Well, I'm glad some people

543
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,874
could resist the lures
of the big game.

544
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,075
Oh, my God!
I forgot the game!

545
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,325
<i>So, with three ticks left</i>
<i>on the clock,</i>

546
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,247
<i>it all comes down</i>
<i>to this one play.</i>

547
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,506
<i>If Washington scores here,</i>
<i>happy fans will be looting</i>

548
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,548
<i>and turning over cars in our</i>
<i>nation's capitol tonight.</i>

549
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,682
<i>Here's the handoff..</i>

550
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,758
Please, please, please.

551
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,762
<i>Touchdown!</i>

552
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,304
<i>Stick a cork in this one,</i>
<i>it is done!</i>

553
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,218
<i>The Washington Redskins</i>
<i>win Super Bowl 26!</i>

554
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,307
I guess you love Dad.

555
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,232
I suspected as much.

556
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,810
Yes! She loves me,
she loves me.

557
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,226
What are you so
happy about, Homer?

558
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,904
You didn't win any money.

559
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,993
Money comes and money goes,
but what I have with my daughter

560
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,279
can go on
for eight more years!

561
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,663

562
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,411
{\an8}Come on, Dad!

563

(panting)

564
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,003
(panting)
It's beautiful.

565
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,344
Isn't it, though?

566
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,459
After I catch
my breath...

567
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:42,677
can we go home?

568
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,431
