1
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:06,006
Ho! Ho! Ho!

2
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:12,180
Happy birthd...!

3
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:12,306
D'oh!

4
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:25,186
D'oh!

5
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,934
<i>Pickin' up trash</i>

6
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,736
<i>Put it in the bag</i>

7
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,638
<i>Kentucky chicken bucket</i>

8
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,274
<i>Put it in the bag</i>

9
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:49,810
<i>Makin' four cents an hour
and free cigarettes</i>

10
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,513
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

11
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:55,649
You have done a beautiful job,
ladies.

12
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:57,651
I think we're ready to move on.

13
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,762
Homer!

14
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,498
I'm awake! I'm awake! What?

15
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,300
Oh, I wish you hadn't done that.

16
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,602
Someone adopted this highway.

17
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,170
Not so loud.

18
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:17,605
The highway doesn't know
it's adopted.

19
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,507
But we love it just the same.

20
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,643
Well, at least you rented
an SUV for this trip.

21
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,945
Now I don't have
to clean up the mess.

22
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,349
I'm starting to get carsick.

23
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,684
Quick, stick your head
out the window!

24
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:32,320
No, no, no, no, it's a rental.

25
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:33,887
Aim inside and blast away.

26
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:35,356
Anyone want a caramel apple?

27
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,191
- It's a rental.
- No, thanks.

28
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:38,559
Shave the dog?

29
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:39,960
It's a rental.

30
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,662
Thank you, no.

31
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,367
Get me candy.

32
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:49,737
What's so funny?

33
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,039
You checked this out
with half a tank,

34
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,141
but now
it's three-quarters full.

35
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:58,011
I'm callin' you Santa 'cause you
just gifted us one-quarter tank.

36
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:02,049
Nobody, and I mean nobody,
calls me Santa.

37
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:05,052
What are you doing, Dad?

38
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,387
I'm gonna burn
that quarter tank.

39
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,889
Wasting gas
while sitting on my ass.

40
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,224
It's the American way.

41
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,044
Amazing, son!

42
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:34,582
Unfortunately, your left foot
just grazed the sideline.

43
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,083
Incomplete pass.

44
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,285
Dad, I've got to pee.

45
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,922
I know it's a rental,
but I'd rather go in the woods.

46
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,223
Maybe I should come with you.

47
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:44,892
Dad, come on.
I'm ten years old.

48
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,294
I can pee by myself.
It's easy.

49
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:48,028
You just shake it
when you're through.

50
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,162
You do what now?

51
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,534
Sketch what you see.

52
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:13,387
Bart, where are you?!

53
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,589
- Bart!
- What is it?

54
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:18,559
Bart...!

55
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,995
Bart!

56
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,163
I don't know,
but I can't shoot it.

57
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,398
Looks like it's pregnant.

58
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:25,799
Let's wait
till they're born,

59
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,134
and then
we'll shoot 'em all.

60
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:31,505
Where the heck were you?

61
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,140
Where's Bart?

62
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,108
Okay, this is the hardest news

63
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:37,077
in the world
for a mother to hear.

64
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,079
Just ease her into it.

65
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,081
You know
that sewing room you wanted,

66
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,684
but we could never
figure out where?

67
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:45,018
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

68
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:46,687
What? My special little guy.

69
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,088
Don't worry, Lou.

70
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,690
If there's one thing
I've mastered,

71
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:53,026
it's consoling
distraught parents.

72
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,495
Ma'am? Ma'am?

73
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:57,130
Can you describe
your son's skeleton?

74
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:59,333
You incompetent...

75
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:01,034
Look, look,
your boy's gonna be fine.

76
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,836
Now we laid out a grid

77
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,473
and have search teams
fanning out over the forest.

78
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:10,478
I'm sorry,
but because of the grid,

79
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:13,847
we have to suspend the search
and bring in some ambulances.

80
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,220
Where is my son?!

81
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,360
Where am I?

82
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:46,013
Welcome to Strategic Air
Command, Springfield Station.

83
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,649
If you're watching this tape,
half the world is doomed.

84
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,584
Says you, General Dead Guy.

85
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:52,753
Behind you
is a Titan II missile,

86
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,321
key to a mighty line of defense

87
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,091
that will reduce our casualties
to an acceptable 200 million.

88
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,064
Dud.

89
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,866
Ay, caramba!

90
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,935
- Bart?
- Bart!

91
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:10,871
- Bart!
- Bart!

92
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:14,842
Now don't worry, I have the best
dang bloodhound in the county.

93
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,044
Does your boy smell
like a fox?

94
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,046
- No.
- We're of no use to you.

95
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:24,084
Come on, Bart.
You made your point!

96
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,053
The whole town is looking
for you.

97
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:29,757
Even that scary old man from the
house with the broken windows.

98
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,925
Bart broke my windows!

99
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,928
It used to be a normal house!

100
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:37,465
All right, listen up.
We have a boy-comma-missing,

101
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,933
and you maggots,
you're gonna help find him.

102
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:41,635
I thought we were ladies.

103
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:44,104
- You're lady maggots.
- Now see here, Sergeant.

104
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,040
You haven't fed us.
We're pretty close to riot mode.

105
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,876
This is the boy.

106
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,645
Never seen him in my life.

107
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:56,083
We all get tattoos we regret.

108
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,318
I will find that boy,

109
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,489
and I will toast you
with his blood!

110
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:03,390
What'd I tell you
about blood toasts, Bob?

111
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,125
To do them,
but not brag about them.

112
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:13,000
Ask not what
your country can do for you.

113
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,603
Ask what you can do
for your country.

114
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:18,138
Doesn't sound
like any president I know.

115
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,016
Freedom!

116
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,151
Oh, I can smell Springfield!

117
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:41,595
Nothing good ever comes
from trying.

118
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,130
Private Homer,

119
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,798
you fat stack of mop buckets!

120
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:47,000
You find something funny
about this?

121
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:50,170
How about I wipe that smile off
your fat face?

122
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,972
Not my Homie!

123
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,174
Avert your eyes, ma'am.

124
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,710
A phone?! Please.

125
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,712
Dial tone. Dial tone.

126
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:00,881
Oh, thank God!

127
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,984
I'm looking for a Miss Culls.

128
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,486
First name Tess,
middle initial T.

129
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,155
Just a sec. I'll check.

130
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:11,559
Tess T. Culls.
Tess T. Culls!

131
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:14,562
Come on! I know you're
hangin' around here somewhere.

132
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:17,064
Why, you little...

133
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,900
When I catch you, I'm gonna
stick a beer tap in ya

134
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,069
and pull till the foam
comes out your ears!

135
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,577
I give up.

136
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,179
If you find Bart,
give me his lunch money.

137
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,214
Well, I'm never giving up.

138
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,849
Why not?

139
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:38,018
Because searching forever
is much easier

140
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,821
than me finding a new friend.

141
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,690
I could be your new friend.

142
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:44,658
- What was that?
- Nothing.

143
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:46,493
Shut up!

144
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,929
His lucky cap!

145
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,834
Bart? Bart?
Are you down there?

146
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,502
Milhouse!

147
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,871
I have never been so glad
to see you.

148
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:00,574
Thanks for not noticing
my new haircut.

149
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:02,075
Just give me your phone.

150
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,179
I'll go get help!

151
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,749
You can count on me!

152
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,787
I lit these for our son.

153
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:16,189
Marge, honey,
he's never gonna come back

154
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,791
if he thinks it's a church.

155
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:20,293
With 78% of the search
area reporting,

156
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:23,530
Channel Six is now projecting
that Bart Simpson is dead.

157
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,199
That's right. Self-proclaimed
underachiever Bart Simpson,

158
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,201
dead at the age of ten.

159
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:31,772
Now let's look at the districts
where he's deadest.

160
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:39,379
Lisa, I have news about Bart.

161
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,981
We already know.

162
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:46,119
Oh, Milhouse,
you were his best friend.

163
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,390
What did you come here for?

164
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,927
I came to tell her he's alive,

165
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:56,964
but this feels almost as good
as hugging Harry Horse.

166
00:09:56,997 --> 00:10:00,668
I came to comfort you
in these uncertain times.

167
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,471
It's over!

168
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,073
We're callin' off the search!

169
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,008
- Did they find him?
- No, he's dead.

170
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,344
No! That can't be.

171
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:16,149
Lord, why do you kill things
that I want to kill?

172
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:19,653
Take me now, vile rake!

173
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:29,997
I think you should look
at Bart's death this way, Bob.

174
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,000
You're free.
You're totally free.

175
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,968
Oh, this slipped off.

176
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:37,705
Have you ever thought
of how your life could've gone

177
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:40,708
had you committed
to good instead of evil?

178
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,175
Evil isn't a choice.

179
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:43,711
I see.

180
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,946
Why don't we try a little
psychological exercise, Bob?

181
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,115
If I unshackle you,
will you behave?

182
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,382
Try me.

183
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,320
Cut out Bart's picture.

184
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:57,324
And by so doing,
cut him out of your life.

185
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,126
Don't listen to them, Bob.

186
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,493
I'm alive.

187
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,237
Are you okay there, Bob?

188
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,805
I won't believe he's dead

189
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,008
until I've made soup
from his bones!

190
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,780
Why do I keep giving
them scissors?

191
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:28,021
Hello?

192
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,990
Hey, Mom, it's me.
Still married?

193
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,158
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

194
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,927
He's alive! And sassy!

195
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,001
One for the road?

196
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,536
It's a long road.

197
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:47,007
I'll see you soon.

198
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:53,413
Hello, Bart's friend.

199
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,115
Bart's alive!

200
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,249
Lead me to Bart.

201
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:57,951
You'll have to kill me first.

202
00:11:57,985 --> 00:12:01,254
But if you kill me,
you'll never find Bart.

203
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:02,956
A conundrum.

204
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,457
How to break you?

205
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:09,029
Tell me,
do you like light operetta?

206
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,131
Oh, how light?

207
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:12,232
And a-one and a-two.

208
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:15,135
<i>I have a song to sing-o</i>

209
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:18,471
<i>Sing me your song-o</i>

210
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:21,274
<i>'Tis sung to the moon
by a lovelorn loon</i>

211
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:23,811
<i>Who fled
from the mocking throng-o</i>

212
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,979
<i>The song of the knell
of a churchyard bell...</i>

213
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:27,080
I give! I give!

214
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,149
I'll take you to Bart!

215
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,150
<i>He cracked like an egg</i>

216
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,651
Please stop!

217
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,153
<i>And began to beg</i>

218
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,088
You promised.

219
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:37,090
<i>As I sang this song-o</i>

220
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,259
<i>It's a song of a popinjay,
bravely born</i>

221
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,761
<i>Who turned up his noble nose
with scorn...</i>

222
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:44,564
Can you at least stab me
in my ear?

223
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,933
No.

224
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,136
Okay, we'll split up
and find Bart.

225
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,338
Thanks for lending this to us,
Ned.

226
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,974
And I'll do the three things
that help the most.

227
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,675
Pray, pray, pray.

228
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,980
What about me?!

229
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:02,149
I ain't ridin' in that!

230
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,516
No, you're pulling it!

231
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,953
Lousy, no good...

232
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:09,022
I couldn't pull you
when you were eight!

233
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:17,030
Angry dad, wise-ass kid.

234
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:19,799
Now, there's a formula
that never fails.

235
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,802
Okay, boys, we're gonna
sing a nice little song.

236
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,504
I want to play cowboys
and Indians.

237
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,173
Calvin, put down that tomahawk.

238
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,008
Calvin. Calvin.

239
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,977
Calvin!

240
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,012
You look funny, Dave.

241
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,646
Dave? Dave?!

242
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,449
<i>God bless America</i>

243
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:40,153
<i>Give me back my tomahawk...</i>

244
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:42,355
That's where he is.
But if you jump down,

245
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,191
you can't get back up
and you'll be caught.

246
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:47,194
So, I guess
that's checkmate.

247
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,528
We're not playing chess.

248
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,730
We're playing a game called
After You.

249
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,165
After me?

250
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:53,166
If you insist.

251
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,909
Oh, God.
I am so sick of these.

252
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:08,081
Twelfth time's the charm!

253
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:09,917
Sideshow Bob?!

254
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,685
That's right.
I found your hidey-hole!

255
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,254
You found my heinie hole?

256
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,057
Ah, yes.

257
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,092
Always the back-of-the-class wit.

258
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:22,662
Well, today you're going to be
a real blast.

259
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,999
I don't like the way
he really hit the word blast.

260
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,374
Bob, it takes two keys.

261
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,177
That way, no nutcase
can do it by himself.

262
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,246
Well, no one ever said
launching two boys

263
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,514
on a 50-year-old missile
would be easy.

264
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:45,018
Wow! For a 50-year-old missile,
it's in terrific shape!

265
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,619
Shut up!

266
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:50,190
I'm a kid who appreciates things
that last.

267
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:55,228
Come on, boy.
Get a good whiff of his scent.

268
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,545
Did you find anything?

269
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,082
We found Bart's sock drawer.

270
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,117
Get back out here!

271
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,386
Well, you can't shoot her.
You know that's a woman.

272
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,589
Oh, this is the last
time I hunt with my lawyer.

273
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,124
Son, I can't go no further.

274
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:26,093
I want to just lie down and die.

275
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:27,560
Dad, you can't die here.

276
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,062
You have to die
in a nursing home,

277
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:31,331
where your body falls apart
as you burn through your savings

278
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,166
till you're
a worthless vegetable.

279
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,667
You know, with dignity.

280
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,970
You're right, son.
We're here on a mission.

281
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:39,272
Now, let's pick out
that Christmas tree.

282
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,174
We're here to find Bart.

283
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:44,277
Right, right. But we got
a nice eight-footer over here.

284
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:47,480
She's got a bare patch,
but we'll turn that to the wall.

285
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,949
That's it. I'm not listening
to another word.

286
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:53,153
Help! Help! Help!

287
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:56,589
For this, you can thank my time

288
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,958
at Cirque du Soleil.

289
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:00,593
More like Cirque du So Lame.

290
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,030
Yes, they are pretty much
all the same.

291
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:06,833
Just a little further...

292
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:09,169
Oh, wait, wrong key.

293
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,107
Five minutes to launch.

294
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,450
Bob, why are you doing this?

295
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,652
Well, it's perfectly obvious.

296
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,154
It's...

297
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,455
Give me a moment.

298
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,023
It's an ICBM.

299
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:31,991
I Commit Bart's Murder!

300
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:34,794
That's your justification
for killing two kids?

301
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,529
I...

302
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:40,033
Dad, look! It's either
Sideshow Bob or Shaq.

303
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:42,169
Not me. I'm going that way.

304
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:43,836
Boy, am I lost.

305
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,205
Shaq, can you help us?

306
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,739
I'm not Superman.

307
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,541
You have a Superman tattoo
on your arm.

308
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:50,343
How do you know so much
about me?

309
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,345
You're scaring me.
I don't have any money.

310
00:16:57,284 --> 00:17:00,053
Have you ever thought
of how your life could've gone

311
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,654
had you committed to good?

312
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,323
It is true. I had talent.

313
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,025
I was on Zoom.
Just send it to Zoom!

314
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,927
Box 350, Boston, Mass.

315
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,330
<i>02134</i>

316
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,832
You don't want to do this.
You're losing it, Bob.

317
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,002
I don't know what's real
and what's hallucination.

318
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,114
Hello?

319
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:28,415
Hello, Doctor. Bob Terwilliger.

320
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,049
Did I catch you at a bad time?

321
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,051
Oh, Bob,
how thoughtful of you to call.

322
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:35,322
Most prisoners rarely follow up
after leaving me to die.

323
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,091
I just need to know,

324
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,759
should I kill these children?

325
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,894
Sounds like someone's got a case
of the shoulds.

326
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,130
If you're calling to ask,

327
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:45,365
it means you already know
the answer.

328
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,699
T minus two minutes.

329
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,067
Clear blast area.

330
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,103
Just tell me, please!

331
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:51,771
He's not allowed to talk.

332
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:06,052
That sounds like
the ignition sequence

333
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,622
of an LGM-25C Titan II-II
ballistic missile.

334
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:12,159
I've had just about enough
of your nonsense!

335
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:15,662
All right, I owe you one.

336
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,731
So, why'd you save us?

337
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:22,502
Because I realized I don't want
to kill you anymore.

338
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,971
Milhouse, is there a knife
in my back?

339
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,507
Not that I can see.

340
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,976
Milhouse, is there
a kick me sign on my back?

341
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,978
Not that I can see.

342
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:36,916
I just can't get a clean shot.

343
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,685
Also, you don't have a gun.

344
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,853
I'm useless, all right.

345
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,824
What a brilliant
conceptual piece.

346
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:45,825
Who's it by?

347
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,627
Norad.

348
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,329
More like Snore-ad.

349
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,199
Wait, is it ticking?

350
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,770
Sooner or later,

351
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:01,040
it all comes down to mopping.

352
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:09,882
Doctor, I'm happy.

353
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:10,983
And when I'm released,

354
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:12,885
after three consecutive
life sentences,

355
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:15,054
I think I'll open a flower shop.

356
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,023
Oh, that's great, Bob.

357
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,058
Not all my patients
are this successful.

358
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,393
Well,

359
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:22,028
I won't be needing his file
anymore.

360
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,564
And if you're interested,
tomorrow's 9:00 appointment

361
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,165
just opened up.

362
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,200
And a 10:00.

363
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:43,250
Your New York Magazine, sir.

364
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,985
This is The New Yorker.
Totally different.

365
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,987
One is the gossip rag
of the glitterati.

366
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,990
The other, an asthmatic dinosaur
that hasn't been relevant

367
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,493
since William Shawn
breathed his last!

368
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,095
Can I go now?
I've got 15 other lighthouses,

369
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,497
and every one's a weirdo.

370
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,098
Not that you are.

371
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,033
Fine. Leave me.
I'll just polish the bulb

372
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:04,471
and ponder a wasted life
as I walk along the shore.

373
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:08,174
I rewrite it
every time the tide goes out.

374
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,776
Listen to me!

375
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,177
Life is short.

376
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,946
Don't spend it
on foolish, empty revenge!

377
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,949
If you buy a mailbox, I wouldn't
have to talk to you anymore.

378
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:17,984
Fine.
