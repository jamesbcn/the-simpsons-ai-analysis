{\an8}-"Rent"?
-Rent to own.

60
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,867
{\an8}Just 35 more payments,
and it's halfway mine.

61
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,449
{\an8}The point is, I've seen
hooligans like you come and go.

62

{\an8}You're all just a big blur

00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,581

{\an8}(chuckles)

66
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,458
{\an8}The best of your era, maybe.

67
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,764
{\an8}Are you saying
was worse than me?

68
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,338
{\an8}(scoffs):
Way worse.

69
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,513
{\an8}Anyway, think
no more about it.

70
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,801
{\an8}You're dismissed.

71
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,144
{\an8}Wait! Wait!
If there's someone worse,

72
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,469
{\an8}I have to know who he is.

73
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,763
{\an8}"He"?

74
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:42,716
{\an8}It's a she?

75
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,465
{\an8}Just kidding,
it's a guy.

76
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,807
{\an8}(both laughing)

77
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,852
{\an8}But let's not dwell
on a mysterious figure

78
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,056
{\an8}from the past who was
your superior in every way.

{\an8}Out you go.

80
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,648
{\an8}Milhouse, there was
a guy who pulled

81
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,106
{\an8}even bigger pranks
than me!

82
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,816

{\an8}Hmm. Lis,

115
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,526
{\an8}I just discovered
something weird.

116
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,237
{\an8}Ten years ago,
this paper didn't publish

117
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,658
{\an8}for two whole weeks.

118
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,126
{\an8}Now, before the gap,
look at Skinner.

119
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,086
{\an8}LISA:
Hmm.

120
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,172
{\an8}And here he is
<i>after </i>the gap.

121
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,392
(Lisa groans)

122
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,139
Hmm, something must've
happened during those two weeks

123
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,931
to turn Skinner from cool to,
as you would say, "tool."

124
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,137
I know what happened:

125
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,056
the ultimate prank.

126
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:58,775
A prank that changed
Skinner from cool to tool.

127
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,438
Is that a backhoe
behind him?

128
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,816
Huh.

129
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,113
It is!

130
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,366
-Zoom in and enhance.
-Mm.

131
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,283
Willie!

132
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,618
He must know the answer.

133
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,332
Before you go,
can you distribute

134
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,872
these newspapers
throughout the school?

135
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,915
Well, I'd be a pretty
lousy brother if I didn't.

136
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,667
Willie, I know
you witnessed

137
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,764
the most awesome prank
since creation.

138
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,049
Can you tell me about it?

139
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,882
I'll nae speak to ye

140
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,507
of those dark times,
Bart Simpson.

141
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,885
But if there was
a more awesome dude than I,

142
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,562
I've got to know who he was,
what he did

143
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,352
and how many days
detention he got.

144
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,895
Something happened.

145
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,728
Something that changed
Skinner and you.

146
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,225
I haven't changed!

147
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,276
I've always been
Swim Teacher Willie

148
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,610
and I always will be!

149
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,114
See, oh...

150
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,856
All right, I'll tell ya.

151
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,948
Years ago,
this school had a pool.

152
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,914
<i>I was an eager, young swim</i>
<i>coach, teaching American youth</i>

153
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:58,417
<i>the revolutionary</i>
<i>Aberdeen crawl.</i>

154
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,091
<i>It was a talented group,</i>
<i>and we were</i>

155
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,379
<i>all set to go</i>
<i>to the state finals.</i>

156
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,343
<i>I shaved and waxed</i>
<i>the boys myself.</i>

157
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:09,965
<i>Then came</i>
<i>the Night of the Wigglers.</i>

158
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,684
What an awesome day!

159
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,182
BOY:
Yo, Skin-man!
Little help?

160
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,638
Right back at you, Jason.

161
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,437
-Stay in school.
-I will.

162
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,321
I am so stoked
for my daily swim.

163
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,819
(whistling)

164
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,240
<i>Had he stopped whistlin'</i>
<i>and looked down,</i>

165
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,529

166
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,953

00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,476

170
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,692
<i>He spent all weekend in that</i>

171
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,533

Shut this pool down,
Groundskeeper Willie.

175
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,828
Willie. Bart.

176
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:20,786
Monster.

177
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,455
So my ass isn't the baddest

178
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,883
in the history
of this school!

179
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:24,881
Who did it, Willie?

180
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,422
His name is Andy Hamilton.

181
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,677
Andy Hamilton.

182
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,346
But whatever you do,

183
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,219
never tell me where
you learned his name,

184
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,677
or I'll kill
whoever told you!

185
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,690
Marge, what
are you doing?

186
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,145
This junk food has got to go.

187
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,396
It's full of chemicals,
trans fats

188
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,738
and hard-pore corn.

189
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:53,703
(gasps)

190
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,993
No!

191
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,917
Don't worry, my sweets!

192
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,918
I'll put out the fire!

193
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,380
Homie, no!

194
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,590
That topping
is a petroleum by-product!

195
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,262
(screams)

196
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,389
-(explosion)
-Ow!

197
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,601
"Andy Hamilton,
53 Hyperion Drive."

198
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,813
Bart, it's not
always a good idea

199
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:22,944
to meet your hero.

200
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,570
I once followed Santa home
from the department store,

201
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,228
and what I saw
<i>wasn't </i>pretty.

202
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,987
I can't live my life,
knowing there might be

203
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,609
someone better than me
at the one thing I'm good at.

204
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:33,777
(doorbell rings)

205
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,244
ANDY:
Entré and partay!

206
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,826
(grunts)

207
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,121
Krazy Glue!

208
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,294
Bart, you've been pranked!

209
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,923
Eh, it needs a topper.

210
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,880
And look, some idiot
left glue loosener

211
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,500
just lying around!

212
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,840
Ah! Here it comes.

213
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,796
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

214
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,216
(groans)

215
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,135
Man, it is an honor

216
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,063
to meet the guy
who wormed Skinner.

217
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,482
You know, when I was your age,

218
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,100
we couldn't film
our pranks for YouTube.

219
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,436
It was local news or nothing.

220
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,691
Potato chip?

221
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,937
Hmm, wait a minute.

222
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,816
Are there spring snakes
in this can?

223
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,612
No, no-no, no-no, no-no.
Give me some credit.

224
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,072
It's a real snake.

225
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,067
-(snake hisses)
-Whoa!

226
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,038
Don't worry, it's defanged.

227
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,328
(snake hisses, Milhouse screams)

228
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,371
Although he can still

229
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,624
rub poison on you
with his gums.

230
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,129
I would really wash
that arm if I were you.

231
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,589
-Can I go home now?
-You should probably wait.

232
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,631
You're going to be
very sleepy for the
next few hours.

233
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,045
Isn't this the best
day of your life?

234
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,886
(shuddering)

235
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,519
So, you want to be

236
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,019
Springfield Elementary's
next Andy Hamilton?

237
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:47,231
Then you'll have to top
these awesome pranks.

238
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,153
The bear traps
in gym class.

239
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,191
The fire in
the drinking fountain.

240
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,025
And, of course,
the fake heart attack

241
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,360
-on an international flight.
-(chuckles)

242
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,366
They had to land
the plane in Nairobi!

243
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,829
Some chick missed
her own wedding!

244
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,829
(clicking)

245
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,041
I am impressed.

246
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:07,381
-(clicking)
-(shivering)

247
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,288
<i>BART:</i>
<i>Oh, Andy has the perfect life.</i>

248
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,918
All he does is reminisce
about his pranks.

249
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,014
And when his mom
gets home from work,

250
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,630
she makes him whatever
sandwich he wants.

251
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,966
(wan chuckle)

252
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,931
This Andy sounds
like kind of a loser.

253
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,061
How could someone so
much like me be a loser?

254
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,968
♪ Loser! ♪

255
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,597
Would a loser have showed me

256
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,064
how to put printer's ink
in a bottle of shampoo?

257
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,694
I've never felt so clean!

258
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,362
♪ A loo-oo-ooser! ♪

259
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,400
Yeah, but, uh, uh...

260
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,324
Dad, Lisa's making me see
things from both sides again!

261
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,114
HOMER: Lisa, I warned
you about that!

262
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,317
Shouldn't Bart have all
the information he needs

263
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,578
to make an informed decision?

264
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,489
Well,you...

265
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,247
Now you're doing
it to me!

266
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,619
Oh!

267
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,580
Mom, what would you do

268
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,837
if someone you cared
about might be a loser,

269
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,299
but they thought
they were awesome?

270
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,049
Are you talking
about your father?

271
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,801
That loser? No.

272
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,682
I'm talking about this guy who's
19 and never really grew up.

273
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,050
Well, when you care
about someone,

274
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,967
it's not out of line
to give them a gentle push

275
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,216
in the right direction.

276
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,097
Got it. Did you
wash those carrots?

277
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,024
(scoffs)

278
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,602
No.

279
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,857
(sighs)

280
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,068
You could have washed them
<i>after </i>you cut them,

281
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,479
but now they're
done for.

282
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,897
(sighing):
Oh!

283
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,953
Well, I don't like the looks
of this place, Marge.

284
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,410
I don't see any standees
for chips, standees for soda.

285
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,792
I don't see any standees at all!

286
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,580
From now on, our family
is eating healthy food

287
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,884
that looks bad on the shelf,
but good in our colon.

288
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,999
Why is that man
carrying a purse?

289
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,546
That's a reusable
grocery bag.

290
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,129
This store doesn't
use plastic bags,

291
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,054
because they end
up in the ocean

292
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,013
and upset jellyfish
mating rituals.

293
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:44,813
Stupid horny jellyfish--
neutering our dudes.

294
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,428
Hmm.

295
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,557
Almond butter,
soy milk,

296
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,524
non-soy dairy-based
soy sauce,

297
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,895
steel-cut spelt husk,

298
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:57,031
Chef Soy-ar-dee soy-based
spaghetti and soy balls,

299
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,569
free-range gluten,

300
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,152
ultra-vegan
invisible cheese...

301
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,317
You know, you don't have

302
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,525
to read the items aloud.

303
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,655
I know what they are.

304
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,951
Okay, that comes to $790.

305
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,576
800 bucks?!

306
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,832
Oh, wait. I didn't see
these blueberries.

307
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,285
$830.

308
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,634
Fine, but we're going

309
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,499
to a regular grocery store
next week.

310
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,876
A week?

311
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,052
Without preservatives,
this food won't last a day.

312
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,341
Look.

313
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,885
Oh!

314
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,969
(laughs)

315
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,517
Huh.

316
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,020
Well, I guess, uh,
<i>they </i>can go either way.

317
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,982
(horns honking)

318
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,403
(car crashing)

319
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,611
WIGGUM:
Oh, God!

320
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,150
Oh, I'm in
horrible pain!

321
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,824
(laughs)

322
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:41,783
(sighs)

323
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,032
Andy, man,
is this the way

324
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,284
you want to spend
the rest of your life?

325
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,077
Having to borrow spray paint
from a ten-year-old kid?

326
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,451
I told you, okay?

327
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,038
I'll pay you back when
I get my allowance.

328
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,753
I mean, not this one,
but the one after next.

329
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,304
Oh, God,
you're right.

330
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,589
Look, I think
I can get you a job.

331
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,973
Krusty owes me a favor

332
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,549
after I perjured myself for him
during a deposition.

333
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,885
You would get me a job?
Thank you, man.

334
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,271
Um, I would keep that on
for the interview.

335
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,558
(horn honking)

336
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:16,653
Hey, hey, if it isn't
my old friend... you!

337
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,190
Krusty, I need a favor.

338
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,614
For you kid, anything,

339
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,112
anything at all!

340
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,073
Although I won't
read screenplays.

341
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,242
That's for your protection.

342
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,450
Oh, and you can't ride
on my private jet.

343
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,121
And I won't give a struggling
young comic his first chance,

344
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,450
I won't give a broken-down hack
his last chance,

345
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,116
I won't buy you kids booze.

346
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,124
The judge was very clear
on that.

347
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,746
Now, what can I do for you?

348
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,923
Oh, and I don't sign footballs
unless you're dying,

349
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,752
and it reverts back to me after
six months if you're not dead.

350
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,258
(horn honks)

351
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,969
As my new second assistant,

352
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,089
you've got to drive me
from my office to the stage,

353
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,007
and if you see anybody
I've screwed over on the way,

354
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,137
avoid them!

355
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,183
Whoa! Ex-wife!

356
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,386
Former writing partner!

357
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,555
Bookie!

358
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,733
Dog I abandoned!
A.A. sponsor!

359
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,772
Love child!

360
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,105
-Tiddly.
-Wink.

361
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,439
Tiddly.

362
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,744
Wink. Didn't Andy
start work today?

363
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,858
Yes. Tiddly.

364
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,034
Then why is he standing
in our driveway?

365
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,283
Wink.

366
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,784
You're supposed
to be at work!

367
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,537
I tried, man, but he was, like,
"Do this thing."

368
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,040
And I'm, like, "Why, dude?"

369
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,291
And he's, like, "I'm your boss!"

370
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,002
And I'm, like, "I quit."

371
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,342
Then you're, like, "You're
supposed to be at work, man."

372
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,498
Then I'm, like, "What?"

373
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,916
You quit after one day?

374
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,014
Yeah.

375
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,628
But today wasn't
a total loss.

376
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,375
On the way home,
I got this--

377
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,757
an ice cube with
a fly in it.

378
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,054
If that was in your drink,

379
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,387
you'd be, like,
"I'm not drinking that!"

380
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,182
I stuck my neck out for you,
and you screwed it up!

381
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,346
(bicycle bell dings twice)

382
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,524
We're not losers!

383
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,562
No, you two
are winners.

384
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,806
Big winners.

385
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,807
When I grow up,

386
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,108
I want to marry a big
winner like you guys.

387
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,613
Shut up!

388
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,700
<i>♪ Doggies and kitties</i>
<i>don't last forever ♪</i>

389
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,254
<i>♪ But they do a lot better</i>
<i>than fish! ♪</i>

390
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:59,169
<i>♪ Flush, flush, fish,</i>
<i>fish, fish, flush... ♪</i>

391
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,879
It's healthy
snack time!

392
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,040
Is it?

393
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,877
We've got sulfite-free
grape juice

394
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,093
and homemade, organic,
non-gluten,

395
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,383
fair-trade zucchini cupcakes!

396
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,427
-Oh!
-Oh!

397
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,010
They don't rise by themselves,

398
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,635
so I was up all night

399
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,681
blowing air bubbles into them
with a straw.

400
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,805
Mmm! Delicious!

401
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:20,022
What percent milk fat
unsalted butter did you use

402
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,364
to grease the cupcake tray?

403
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,978
None percent.

404
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,775
I used a nonstick pan.

405
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,988
(all retching)

406
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,450
Don't you know that nonstick
pans are made with P.F.O.A.s?

407
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,782
Oh, boy, here it comes.

408
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:37,367
There is only one thing more
dangerous than P.F.O.A.s, Marge.

409
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,164
Plastics made with B.P.A.s.

410
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:43,038
Never, ever let your child near
any product with the number...

411
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,134
Seven!

412
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:50,093
Good Lord,
they've been sucking seven! Oh!

413
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,519
(siren blaring)

414
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,692
(groans)

415
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,949
All right, Andy.

416
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,659
It was not easy
to get your job back.

417
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,199
You did me a solid, man.

418
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,622
And I promise you,
I will not leave this job

419
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,081
unless I flake
or it becomes bogus.

420
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,792
No, that's not
good enough.

421
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,832
I want you to shake my hand
as a fellow prankster

422
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,995
and swear you will
try your best.

423
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,094
-Psych!
-Psych!

424
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,209
We have a deal.

425
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,835
(humming)

426
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,010
Marge?

427
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,721
Sorry I'm late.
I was working overtime,

428
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,101
so we'd have extra money
to buy fruit salad.

429
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,018
-Honey, what are you doing?
-Hmm?

430
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,390
Nothing!

431
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,807
(swallows) Nothing!

432
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,556
It's okay.
You can tell me.

433
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,072
I found your stash.

434
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,401
(gasps)

435
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:54,776
You found the precious!

436
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,825
I know, I know.

437
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,739
I've eaten
your trans fats,

438
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,077
your red dye number two.

439
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,712
Even this!

440
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,998
Oh, Marge, I'm seeing

441
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,094
a brand-new
side of you-- me.

442
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,010
(Homer and Marge laughing)

443
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,300
More Lard Glug, my sweet?

444
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,473
I never want to stop.

445
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,182
Did you know
that Lard Glug

446
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,772
contains neither
lard nor glug?

447
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:20,968
From now on,

448
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,228
we'll only make
the kids eat healthy.

449
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,771
I can't believe
Andy's lasted a week.

450
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,765
Yeah, to congratulate him,
I got him the most

451
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,777
grown-up thing I could
think of: a Caesar salad.

452
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,404
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Stage 6.

453
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,568
I've got a delivery
for a Mr. Andy Hamilton.

454
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,408
-Right over there.
-Oh, thank you.

455
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,078
(gasps)

456
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,378
(bell ringing)

457
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,014
Louie, have you
seen Andy?

458
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,764
I think he's gonna
ruin the show!

459
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,806
Eh, he's about
20 seasons too late.

460
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,229
(laughing)

461
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,478
(coughing)

462
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,766
(gasps)

463
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,315
(drumroll)

464
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,453
Now, to dive in this pool

465
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,740
of clear, blue water.

466
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,873
(gasps)

467
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,631
(Krusty yelps)

468
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,999
Put me down!

469
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:30,995
You're ruining the bit!

470
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,876
No! I won't see you end up

471
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,473
like Skinner,
twisted and deranged.

472
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,429
Watch the <i>Krusty Show,</i>
they tell me.

473
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,429
You'll forget your troubles,
they tell me.

474
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,221
Uh, how much
do you weigh?

475
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,765
Oh, 180, maybe 190.

476
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,389
Plus I'm wearing about 30
pounds of pancake makeup

477
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,646
and I'm always packing heat.

478
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,019
Plus the owner's manual
for my Cadillac.

479
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,516
(straining)

480
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,568
(screaming)

481
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,453
(gasping)

482
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:05,695
I wanted warm water,
not worm water.

483
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,457
(audience laughing)

484
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,633
What's going on?

485
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,841
Krusty needed a bit.

486
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,461
And I got a great one.

487
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,377
Thanks to my new
head writer, Andy Hamilton.

488
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,547
(Krusty laughs)

489
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,005
Bart, thank you for believing
I could grow up.

490
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,925
My pranking days
are over, for good.

491
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,684
What's gotten into you, man?

492
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,976
Andrew, I wanted
to show you something

493
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,440
in the make-out room--
uh, makeup room.

494
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,060
I'll be right there
in a minute, babe.

495
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,033
Looks like I just bought
some property on Boner Way.

496
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,029
So now Andy's a TV writer.

497
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,952
Loser.

498
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:45,541
♪ <i>Loser, loser. </i>♪

499
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,829
