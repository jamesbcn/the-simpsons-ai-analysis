1
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:11,378
Oh, boy, Lenny is gonna be
so surprised.

2
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,347
And I got the perfect card.

3
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,316
Over the hill than under it.
Yeah.

4
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,922
Having chipped in,
you may now sign.

5
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,624
Nice work.

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,059
No best wishes,
I like the restraint.

7
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:29,730
Yeah, I thought about regards,
but Lenny knows how I feel.

8
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,768
Okay, everybody, be quiet.

9
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,905
Lenny's gonna be here
any minute.

10
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,277
Sur... prise.

11
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:46,113
I thought this was
my blood transfusion room,

12
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,248
but there's not
a baby in sight.

13
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,784
It's a surprise party
for Lenny, sir.

14
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:53,987
Everybody chipped in five bucks
for a card and a cake

15
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,824
and a show by close-up magician
Abraca-Debra.

16
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,961
What? Damn!

17
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:03,630
Well, in that case,
I suppose I should sign too.

18
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:09,670
With regards,
C. Montgomery Burns.

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,509
Lenny, happy birthday.

20
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,792
This is the greatest
birthday ever!

21
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,528
And best of all,
Mr. Burns signed my card.

22
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,396
To everyone who chipped in.

23
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:39,032
Chipped in. Chipped in.

24
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,035
Chipped in.

25
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,706
What kind of person
signs a birthday card

26
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,140
and doesn't chip in?

27
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,176
You sign the card,
you got to chip in.

28
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:52,746
- It's the code of the card.
- How big did he sign?

29
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,581
Eddie Bauer big.

30
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,252
Stupid unpaid signature.

31
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,854
This is the worst thing
that ever happened

32
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,689
at a nuclear power plant.

33
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,725
Homie, just let it go.

34
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,394
Don't let a signature
drive you crazy.

35
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,729
You're right, honey.

36
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,230
I'll let it go.

37
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,866
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

38
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:17,671
Happy birthday, Lenny.

39
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,539
No. No!

40
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,208
No!

41
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,844
Homie, what is it?

42
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,513
I had the most
horrible nightmare

43
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,916
where I listened to your advice.

44
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,718
Okay, okay.

45
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,053
Okay, Homer, you can do this.

46
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,388
You can make things right.

47
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,265
Mr. Burns, everyone who signed

48
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,534
that birthday card chipped in
except for you.

49
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,603
You owe five dollars.

50
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,872
How dare you...

51
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:54,474
give that the slightest worry.

52
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,209
Hope you didn't lose any sleep

53
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,878
over this little
misunderstanding.

54
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,180
Here, have a cricket
on a thread for good luck.

55
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,452
You monster...

56
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,953
taking advantage of an old man.

57
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,221
What are you talking about?

58
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,790
Mr. Burns is heavily medicated

59
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,692
on a round-the-clock regimen
of skin thickeners.

60
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,397
The side effect
of that medication

61
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,399
is bouts
of uncontrollable decency.

62
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,268
And you exploited that.

63
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,737
I'm demoting you
to the worst job in this place.

64
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:26,606
Supervising
the nuclear plant interns.

65
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,084
Listen up, millenniums.
I'm Homer Simpson,

66
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,752
your new supervisor.

67
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,254
So stop Snapchatting,
Fortnite-ing

68
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,124
and swiping right
on your Uber Venmos.

69
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:47,294
We're actually replicating
plant start-up sequences

70
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,297
to simulate the effects
of high-demand energy draws.

71
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,099
Contamination versus
irradiation...

72
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,333
Your thoughts?

73
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,768
Address rate of reaction.

74
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,937
What variables can we assume?

75
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:08,148
This guy is denser
than osmium-188.

76
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,322
Are my ears hearing this?

77
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,657
Are you seriously busting
the clangers

78
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,459
of Homer J. Simpsons?

79
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:22,863
This man is a god and his
clangers are unbustable.

80
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,965
You're looking
at the Michael Jordan

81
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,600
of Sector 7G.

82
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,803
And you humps aren't worthy
to swill his backwash.

83
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,772
You're sticking up for me?

84
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,006
Who are you?

85
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,041
Mike Wegman, nuclear intern.

86
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,843
And your number one fan.

87
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,945
Yeah, well, your hero
has a Pop-Tart

88
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,614
in his cell phone holster.

89
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,254
Are you kidding?

90
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,992
No one disrespects
Homer Simpsons.

91
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:55,595
Not you, Ricky,
with your standing desk.

92
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,031
It's not a workout,
it's been disproven.

93
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,599
And not you, Gretchen,

94
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,835
drinking coffee creamer
straight from the bottle.

95
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:04,171
You exude amaretto, you freak.

96
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:07,007
And, Benjamin, no one ever
got trampled

97
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,975
at a Michael BublÃ© concert.

98
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:12,145
Drop the friggin' lawsuit,
you're clogging up the system.

99
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,181
This man is a dynamo.

100
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,250
So you shaved coconuts
give him your full respect.

101
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,886
All right, all right.
Sorry, Mr. Simpson.

102
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,755
Looking forward to learning
from you, Mr. Simpson.

103
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,858
People at work usually yell
at me, not for me.

104
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,426
How do you know who I am?

105
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,429
So modest.
What a dynamo.

106
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,264
Because of this.

107
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,899
Whenever there's trouble,

108
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,402
you are at the heart
of the action.

109
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,271
Number six is why
all those horses went bald.

110
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,274
Yeah. Well, I've been
looking up to you for so long

111
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,877
from the cheap seats, and now
we're finally face-to-face,

112
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,246
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I got to ask...

113
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:48,949
Will you be my coach?
My sensei?

114
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,918
Homer J. Simpsons,
will you be my mentor?

115
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:57,591
If you accept, let me know

116
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,593
by taking this half a PowerBar.

117
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,662
I rolled up the wrapper really
good so there's no pocket lint.

118
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:06,366
Mike Wegmans,
I will be your mentor.

119
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,146
Okay, which of these ties
is better

120
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,582
for my first day as a mentor?

121
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,085
Purple stripes or this one?

122
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,621
Are you wearing my perfume?

123
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,257
I like it on you,
he'll like it on me.

124
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,225
Dad, it's not often that you...

125
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:33,493
How do I put this?

126
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,162
Care so much about your job?

127
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,432
Well, now that I'm a mentor,
everything's changed.

128
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,768
For the first time,
another human being

129
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,404
is dependent on me
to guide them through life.

130
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,142
This guy I'm menting is so cool.

131
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,344
He listens with his mouth open.

132
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,881
He's been blocked by so many
celebrities on Twitter.

133
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,816
And he thinks
I'm the most valuable worker

134
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,485
at the entire nuclear plant.

135
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,886
Oh, I get it.

136
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,455
He's super dumb.

137
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,291
Mock all you want.

138
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,394
I finally have someone at work
who admires me.

139
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,465
He's fat.

140
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,301
Homer, your pants.

141
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,802
They'll come around again.

142
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,737
They always do.

143
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,474
There's my thoroughbred.

144
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,476
I got your coffee
just the way you like it.

145
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,545
No coffee, just doughnut holes.

146
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,050
Oh, my God,
are you busting my bricks?

147
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,351
Is this real?

148
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:32,986
Sector 7G.

149
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,889
7G, where Olympus fears
to tread.

150
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,557
He sure does.

151
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,894
Okay, you are a category five
hurricane of knowledge,

152
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,697
and I'm like that old idiot
who won't leave his beach house.

153
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,499
Please, drown me in my attic
with what you know.

154
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,068
I thought you might say that.

155
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,705
So I've prepared
inspirational posters.

156
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,173
I feel like Amar'e Stoudemire

157
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,542
when he first set foot
in Jerusalem.

158
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,212
What else you got?

159
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,814
Let's see...

160
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,382
- Don't forget about the...
- Yeah.

161
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,850
- Oh, and of course...
- Gold.

162
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,352
- You got to, you just got to.
- Gold. Okay.

163
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,619
- Because if you don't...
- Soakin' it in. Gold.

164
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,355
- Well, oh.
- Soakin' it in.

165
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,856
- Well, they don't have that anymore.
- I can remember this.

166
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,358
- And you see these?
- Yeah.

167
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,626
- I'm gonna tell you that later.
- Yeah.

168
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,228
I can't believe this.

169
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,697
I'm only 35 and I am sitting
at the feet

170
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,632
of the atomic Baba Booey.

171
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,202
You're 35?

172
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,204
Then why do you have a job
of a 20-year-old

173
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,872
and talk like a ten-year-old?

174
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:26,906
Here's how it is.

175
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,375
So, my buddy 'Nesto and me

176
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,642
were cleaning gutters for cash,

177
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,078
when that idiot 'Nesto falls off

178
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:34,881
and lands on a doghouse.
Stupid 'Nesto.

179
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,550
Then my parents are on my case
to get a real career,

180
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,386
something
closer to the ground.

181
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,421
So I thought,
why not follow my hero

182
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,890
into man's greatest calling?

183
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,392
Nuclear whatever.

184
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,893
So I went down to the plant,

185
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,561
told them I was part
Native American...

186
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,597
I could be,
I always liked those guys...

187
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,732
and boom! I'm an intern.

188
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,468
Three short years later,
got myself a mentor.

189
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,405
My posters really worked.

190
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,507
But you don't need me
telling you how great you are,

191
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,509
you get enough of that
at home.

192
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,915
Happy birthday, Lenny.

193
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,350
Say, Mike,

194
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:13,386
why don't you come over
to my house for dinner?

195
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,588
I've got some people
I'd like to introduce

196
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,557
to the way you act around me.

197
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,426
Okay. I could do that.

198
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,094
I could make that happen.

199
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,595
I got this.

200
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,631
Hey, Lenny,
you duck-faced psycho,

201
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,800
guess who's going
to Homer Simpson's house

202
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,568
for a meal? Me.

203
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,370
I'm Carl.

204
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,573
I wish you would give me
more of a heads-up

205
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,708
before inviting a mentee
for dinner.

206
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,410
I guess we'll have enough

207
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:40,980
if I double the chip layer
on the casserole.

208
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,317
Don't worry,
you're gonna love this kid.

209
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,920
Kid? He looks 40-plus.

210
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,789
Oh, Homer, she is a beaut.

211
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,125
Now I know why you're always
napping at work.

212
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:53,860
Mr. Plow, indeed.

213
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,829
Hello. I'm Marge.

214
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,664
Mike Wegman.
This is Maureen.

215
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,333
And this
is Patrick Ewing Wegman.

216
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,103
It's a girl.
You can't name her Patrick.

217
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,672
2.4 blocks per game, lifetime.

218
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,474
She's Patrick.

219
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,008
Look at this spread.

220
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,277
I was expecting, like,
a party sub...

221
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:14,080
But hot carrots?
Who thinks of that?

222
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,583
Slow it, you'll burn
your mouth again.

223
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,251
All right, all right,
I'm gonna blow on 'em.

224
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,387
Thank you for having us.

225
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,190
Mike admires your husband
so much.

226
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,192
Do you hear that? So much!

227
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,228
They don't admire me any much.

228
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,764
You better hold on
to this guy, Marge,

229
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,167
'cause if he were single,
he'd be cleaning up.

230
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,870
I mean cleaning up, knee-deep.

231
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,071
Don't worry, honey.

232
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,206
You're the only woman for me.

233
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,574
I wasn't worried.

234
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,111
So, Mrs. Wegman,
how did you two meet?

235
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,880
Oh, well,
you're gonna love this story.

236
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,615
It's so romantic.
Tell her, honey.

237
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,816
Go ahead, tell her.

238
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,551
He was a waiter at my wedding.

239
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,920
She was so beautiful,
like one of those girls

240
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,156
you see leaving Vinny's bedroom
on Entourage

241
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,757
that don't say nothin'.

242
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,364
So, Mike, you seem
like a sharp tack.

243
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,432
What exactly is
my dad teaching you?

244
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,701
How to eat doughnuts
while napping?

245
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,039
Did this little hump just say
what I thought I heard?

246
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,908
It's okay, Mike.
I don't sweat it.

247
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,277
Yeah, Mike, the only thing
Homer sweats is gravy.

248
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:23,082
No one disrespects
Homer Simpsons!

249
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,085
Especially not
an ugly little punk like you.

250
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,921
That's right, I said ugly.

251
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,923
Your head looks like
a rejected Muppet.

252
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,425
Two golf balls glued
to a can of oats.

253
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:35,929
Between that Tommy Lasorda gut
and those toothpick legs,

254
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:39,799
you are not a kid...
you are a walkin' potato clock.

255
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,804
Ha-ha-ha! Ugly!

256
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,609
Muppet...

257
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:53,446
Toothpick legs!

258
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:54,781
Potato clock!

259
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,388
I'm just bustin'
your clangers, kid.

260
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,590
All right, it's okay.

261
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,291
I want you out!

262
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,800
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

263
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,135
Where's the baby registered?!

264
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,504
DraftKings!

265
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,140
How many times
do I have to say I'm sorry?

266
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,809
Once would be nice.

267
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,545
Wow, you're really bustin'
my clangers.

268
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,013
That guy's a lunatic.

269
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,348
He's not crazy.

270
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,183
He's the only one
that respects me!

271
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,018
The kids and I respect you.

272
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,886
All you guys ever did
was love me.

273
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,723
But look me in the eyes
and tell me you respect me,

274
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,558
as a nuclear guy.

275
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,498
I just liked the feeling

276
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:48,167
that one person thinks
I'm good at something.

277
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,136
I get it, Homie.

278
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,505
But if you really want
to help this guy,

279
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,440
help him grow up.

280
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,512
Come on, Fordham,

281
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,647
Bucknell's got
no rim protection.

282
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,216
They're garbage.
Just cover the spread.

283
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,019
Hey, Homer.
How's it clangin'?

284
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,488
I'm just tunin' in
to a little college hoops.

285
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,723
Yeah, Mike, I was thinking,

286
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,727
if you weren't
a 35-year-old unpaid intern

287
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,864
with a baby on the way,
do you have any other dreams?

288
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,566
Ah, man, you are
mentoring me hard right now.

289
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,236
Oh, okay, I'm gonna tell you,
but don't laugh.

290
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,671
I won't.

291
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,306
Slices.

292
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,641
Nothing better than getting
a slice of pizza, right?

293
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,678
But it's always been under
the heat lamp all dried out.

294
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,579
Damn heat lamp.

295
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,416
Right. So why not make the pizza
one slice at a time,

296
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,583
hot and fresh?

297
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,686
Every slice is Derek Jeter.

298
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,854
No Scott Brosius in the bunch.

299
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,890
That's genius!

300
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,092
Oh, my God,
I can't believe you like it.

301
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,362
Mike! You know what you
should call your slices?

302
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,597
Mike's Slices.

303
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,099
I'm Mike!

304
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,601
Yeah! Okay,
what you need is an investor,

305
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,704
and I know the perfect person.

306
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,806
He gave me five dollars.

307
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,009
Every slice hot and fresh

308
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,011
from the oven into your mouth.

309
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,113
Every slice a Jeter.

310
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,916
No Scott Brosiuses.

311
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,919
Why can't I get a whole pizza
and slice it myself?

312
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,454
There are no whole pizzas.

313
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,056
It's just slices, hot and fresh.

314
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,892
And don't worry about investing
with this guy, Mr. Burns,

315
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,395
because he's backed
by the full mentorship

316
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,764
of Homer J. Simpsons.

317
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:27,266
Then it's my pleasure
to tell you...

318
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,903
that that is the stupidest idea
I've ever heard.

319
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,240
Get this intern out
of my office, you nincompoop!

320
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:41,114
Ho! No one disrespects
Homer J. Simpsons.

321
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,949
No, Mike, don't.

322
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:43,783
Nin...

323
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,184
com... poop!

324
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,453
Listen to me, you skunk-bag
full of Centrum Silver

325
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,422
sitting
on your peanut brittle ass

326
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,424
with your turn-of-the-century
buzzard face.

327
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,960
You ain't worthy to squeegee
this man's back sweat.

328
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,129
You smell like Chinese food
that someone left

329
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,830
in an old jack-o'-lantern.

330
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,733
My mentor is the shiniest
diamond in the whole Zales,

331
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,469
so stuff your organs
back in their jars

332
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,605
and crawl in your mummy box,

333
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,641
you sick, fungused-up,
hep-C Dracula!

334
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,179
By the way,
he's off his happy pills.

335
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,186
You're lucky Mr. Burns's gun
was 200 years old.

336
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,754
Yeah, but now my doctor says

337
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,823
I can't get shot
in the face again.

338
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,825
Who's ugly now, pellet-head?

339
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,830
Come on, it's okay. Don't cry.

340
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,800
I'm not. All the BBs in my head
are making it heavy.

341
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,501
Mike, this is all my fault.

342
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:38,371
I know you think I'm a great
nuclear guy, but I'm not.

343
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,273
I didn't stop those accidents.

344
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,808
I caused them.

345
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,543
Huh? No. No.

346
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,478
All my posters...
Bet on Yourself.

347
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,213
Go Big or Go Home.

348
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,016
I was caught shoplifting those
from a poster store.

349
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:53,586
I was trying to go big, and
they wouldn't let me go home.

350
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:57,190
Mike, face it, I'm a bad mentor.

351
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,725
No one disrespects
Homer Simpsons.

352
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,360
Not even you.

353
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,863
You're the best mentor
a lousy bride-banger like me

354
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,264
could ever ask for.

355
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,133
And I'm gonna prove it.

356
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,701
Who spilled BBs

357
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,937
all over the...

358
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:16,142
Yo! Mentor!

359
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,382
Anybody want a slice of pizza

360
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,551
that wasn't sliced from a pizza?

361
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,587
Where'd you get a food truck?

362
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,523
It's all cause of you, mentor,
all cause of you. Deal with it.

363
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,758
The boys and I
will take a large pie.

364
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,861
Can't you read a truck,
Cookie Puss?

365
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,095
Slices only!

366
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,030
All righty,
three slices, please.

367
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,734
They'll be ready in 13,
26 and 39 minutes.

368
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,903
And don't block the window,
sizzle chest.

369
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,572
When will my slice be ready?

370
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,275
And by slice,
I mean the first payment

371
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,777
on your outstanding loan.

372
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,580
You borrowed money
from the mob?!

373
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,549
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's all good.

374
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,752
I took a one-week loan from
Fat Tony for a hundred grand.

375
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,687
I put $50k into the truck

376
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,190
and then bet the other 50
on tonight's Lehigh game,

377
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,658
which is a lock.

378
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,060
So when I win the bet,
I pay back the mob,

379
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,363
and I own the truck
free and clear.

380
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,697
Oh, no.

381
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:14,066
You bet on yourself!

382
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,402
Go big or go home, baby.

383
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,271
And Lehigh's in trouble

384
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,107
as Holy Cross goes
on an unanswered 20-point run.

385
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,643
No, no, no, Lehigh is a lock!

386
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,946
They're undefeated on floors
with hockey ice beneath them.

387
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:30,449
Yet again, a man's life hangs
by the gossamer thread

388
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,152
of Patriot League basketball.

389
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,320
Guns up.

390
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,124
But Lehigh takes the lead
with a three

391
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,926
from way behind the arc.

392
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,794
- Yes!
- Guns down.

393
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,430
But the Crusaders answer

394
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,499
with a floater in the key!

395
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,569
And Lehigh comes back
with a monster dunk!

396
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,837
Yeah!

397
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,541
As the final seconds tick away,
Lehigh has this one in the bag!

398
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,144
The body bag!

399
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,079
As a last-second
half-court heave

400
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,315
gives Holy Cross the win.

401
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,883
Guns up.

402
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,918
Safeties off.

403
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,389
Don't worry, I know a place

404
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,891
where they will never find us.

405
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:19,131
A food truck graveyard.

406
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,640
Why are there
so many failed ones?

407
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:30,710
'Cause they don't have
an original concept, like me.

408
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,062
Homer, I got to tell you
one thing.

409
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,530
Your boy's not ugly.

410
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:52,865
He's gorgeous.

411
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,400
Just like his old man.

412
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,901
He's gonna clean up.

413
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,703
Tell baby Patrick I loved her.

414
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,572
All right, do me.

415
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,876
I smell mozzarella

416
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:08,681
gently melting over a single
slice of triangular dough.

417
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:12,785
Before the end,
we will share a pie.

418
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:15,087
It's just slices,
you goombah caveman!

419
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,524
Usually a slice
is dried out

420
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:21,560
from sitting under a heat lamp,
but this is hot and fresh!

421
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,696
See? This guy has good ideas.

422
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,197
What if...

423
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:29,301
you let Mike work in the truck
to pay you back?

424
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:32,038
No. The food truck business
is too big a gamble.

425
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,440
And even our gambling operation
is in trouble

426
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,743
with the advent
of legal online wagering.

427
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,112
Too bad you can't take action
out of my food truck,

428
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,614
let the betting come to you.

429
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,416
Now, do me already!

430
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:46,118
A food truck that takes bets?

431
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,222
I'll take a slice of cheese

432
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,458
and the moneyline on Georgetown.

433
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:57,263
Yo, Tony! We're raking it in
on the sportsbook.

434
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:01,133
And it was a great idea to sell
weed out of this thing also.

435
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,772
Homer, you believed
in this stagelagoots

436
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,841
when no one else would.

437
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:11,610
You listened to him,
nurtured his ideas,

438
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,013
and now he is a success.

439
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,117
Truly, you are
an excellent mentor.

440
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:19,819
<i>Let</i>

441
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,122
<i>The river run</i>

442
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:26,425
<i>Let all the dreamers</i>

443
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:30,629
<i>Wake the nation</i>

444
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,498
<i>Come</i>

445
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:38,471
<i>The new Jerusalem...</i>

446
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:46,045
<i>Silver cities rise...</i>

447
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:54,320
<i>It's asking for the taking</i>

448
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:59,759
<i>Trembling, shaking</i>

449
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:04,930
<i>Oh, my heart is aching</i>

450
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,265
<i>We're coming to the edge</i>

451
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,300
<i>Running on the water</i>

452
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,503
<i>Coming through the fog,
your sons and daughters</i>

453
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:14,340
<i>Let the river run</i>

454
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:18,344
<i>Let all the dreamers</i>

455
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,347
<i>Wake the nation</i>

456
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:27,086
<i>Come, the new Jerusalem...</i>
