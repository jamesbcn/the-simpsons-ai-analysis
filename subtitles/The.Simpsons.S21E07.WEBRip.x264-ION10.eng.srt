Why did I do Poetry Club
instead of Girl Scouts?

-But we don't like outsiders
observing our esbat.
-Uh-huh.

175
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,888
What's an esbat?

176
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,063
An ancient ritual
in celebration of the full moon.

177
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:57,893
We're Wiccans.

178
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,147
You mean witches?

179
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,558
Technically...

180
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,356
but we're not
into broomsticks

181
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,980
or pointy hats.

182
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,146
Well, I'm glad
you're not witches.

183
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:09,195
Wouldn't want you
to cast a spell on me.

184
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,160
Oh, we cast spells.

185
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,870
And they work.

186
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,580
Sure, they do.

187
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,950
If magic was real,
I'd use it to get out

188
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,828
of my pipe cleaner art project
that's due tomorrow.

189
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,251
You should keep
an open mind.

190
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,916
Things said in the circle

191
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,714
have a surprising way
of coming true.

192
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,177
HOMER:
Lisa. Lisa!

193
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,088
Dad, over here!

194
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,508
Come, sisters
of the elements.

195
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,926
Let us leave this place
in a manner most Wiccan.

196
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,425
What are you
talking about?

197
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,347
Text your mom
to pick us up.

198
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,613
Oh, sweetie,
I found you.

199
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,439
Now, who's going
to find us?

200
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,605
Help!

201
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:51,985
Uh-oh.

202
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,164
(ticking)

203
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,496
I have one minute to avoid
my first late assignment ever.

204
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,962
(frustrated grunting)

205
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,002
The pipe cleaner fur
is coming off on my hands.

206
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,550
Class, Miss Hoover
will not be in today,

207
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,715
so you all get A's

208
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,434
on your pipe cleaner
sculptures.

209
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,774
(students cheering)

210
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,348
-Ha ha!
-Yes!

211
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,018
What happened to Miss Hoover?

212
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,313
Came down with a spell
of stomach flu.

213
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,977
Spell? Those girls couldn't

214
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,185
have made her sick...
or could they?

215
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,446
Maybe we'll pass the time
with another craft project.

216
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,909
I'll let one of you pick.

217
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,409
Uh... Lisa.

218
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,160
Which craft?

219
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,082
(gasps)

220
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,829
Which craft?

221
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,831
(gasps)

222
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,162
Which craft?!

223
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,458
(sighs)

224
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,632
CLETUS:
This here country is home

225
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,301
to over 300
family-owned stills.

226
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,130
None of them big
corporate moonshiners,

227
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,006
like Crazy-Think
White Lightning

228
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,183
or Dwayne Saggery's
Demento Juice.

229
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,893
So, let's go taste some
independent hooch!

230
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,055
♪♪

231
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,947
♪♪

232
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,629
Hey, thanks for bringing us
down here, Homer.

233
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,383
Yeah. There's
something wonderful

234
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,875
about being
drunk outdoors.

235
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,886
I wonder if
Moe misses us.

236
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,138
MOE:
No, I don't miss you.

237
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,139
Now, get back to my bar
for happy hour,

238
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,932
or I'll paint the snow pink
with your brains.

239
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,767
(guns cocking)

240
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:49,153
Drop your fire sticks,
man possum.

241
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,361
Oh, uh, so, uh... so I guess
this means you hillbillies

242
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,112
are going to have your way
with me, huh?

243
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,864
Oh, for God's sake.

244
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,855
You know, one hillbilly
has his way

245
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,077
with one fat guy
in <i>Deliverance,</i>

246
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,118
and suddenly, people think
that's all hillbillies do.

247
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,753
I suppose you think all space
is <i>Star Wars.</i>

248
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,831
No, I... I thought we had
a connection here,

249
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,087
and we're out in the woods
and everything, and...

250
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,669
Hey, forget it!
I...I ain't gonna beg for it.

251
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,126
You'll never know
what you missed out on.

252
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,047
(horse neighs)

253
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,308
(cat meows)

254
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,560
Did you girls make
Miss Hoover sick?

255
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:29,983
Oh, no, we would never ask
the Goddess to harm a teacher.

256
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,194
But if the Goddess
chose to help you

257
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,324
by giving Miss Hoover
the Hershey Squirts,

258
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,113
such is her divine wisdom.

259
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:41,366
Oh, listen, not that
I've lost my skepticism,

260
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,580
but I am interested
in learning more about Wiccans.

261
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,951
Are you a minority group

262
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,747
as defined by
Ivy League admissions?

263
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:47,671
Cornell and Dartmouth.

264
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,038
What else ya got?

265
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,375
We worship nature.

266
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,999
I worship nature!

267
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,416
Want to join us?

268
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,134
Well, it is an honor
to be asked.

269
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,755
But I never make
a final decision

270
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,432
in the middle of a
forest at night.

271
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,970
FRANKIE: Hey, hey,
that's smart thinkin'!

272
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,513
Shut up and dig
your own grave.

273
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,756
What if I don't dig it?

274
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:04,968
What are you gonna do then?

275
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,017
Guess I'll have to
dig it for ya.

276
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,061
With your bad back?
Forget about it!

277
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,056
(grunting)

278
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,895
LISA:
Hmm...

279
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,365
Is that a pentagram?

280
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,789
Lis! You've finally come
over to the dark side!

281
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,249
Um, it's the Wiccan home page.

282
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,039
I'm thinking of joining.

283
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,504
No, no, no.

284
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,634
You're too young
to be a witch.

285
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,171
Savor the steps
leading up to it.

286
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,875
College anorexic,
string of bad marriages,

287
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,676
career disappointments,
failed pottery shop.

288
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,551
And then when you're
old and alone,

289
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,887
you can hit
the witch thing hard.

290
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,929
(dissonant note)

291
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,396
Hey, every witch
needs a familiar.

292
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,611
I'm gonna put a spell on you!
Yes, I am,

293
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,322
-my tuna-breath familiar.
-(meows)

294
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,992
(giggling):
Zap! Zap! Zap!

295
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,531
Zap! Zap! Zap!

296
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,775
I curse you, Hell's Kitten!

297
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,036
Just as I feared.

298
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,578
Her Buddhism has led
directly to witchcraft.

299
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,747
(gasps) And she's
teleconferencing the Devil

300
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,544
using that computer from Hell!

301
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,128
I think it says "Dell."

302
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,263
We'll let the authorities
sort that out.

303
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,015
(slurping)
Mmm, not bad.

304
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:36,443
-(sirens wailing)
-What's that twirly ruckus?

305
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,824
(gasps) The gummiment!

306
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,031
(panicked chattering)

307
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:47,082
("Cursum Perficio" plays)

308
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,293
Initiate, how does one
enter the circle?

309
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,333
With perfect faith
and perfect love.

310
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:59,957
WICCANS (chanting):
Join us, join us, join us.

311
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,550
Do not sanctify that witch!

312
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,795
(music stops)

313
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,604
I kinda feel sorry for them,
crammed in that backseat.

314
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,894
Toss them a Judy Blume
novel, Lou.

315
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,308
Uh, all we've got is
<i>Wifey, </i>Chief.

316
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,687
Nothing with kids in it?

317
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,903
Damn budget cuts.

318
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:27,281
CROWD (chanting): Burn, burn,
burn! Burn, burn, burn!

319
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,486
Double bubble boil and trouble?

320
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,578
Today, Springfield will see

321
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,422
its first witch trials
in 12 years.

322
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,288
Oh, I think I see
the witches now.

323
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,205
This reporter
has never encountered

324
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,804
such disfigured crones.

325
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,589
We're not the witches!

326
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,012
Oh, well then
you must be victims

327
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,760
of the witches'
hideous curse.

328
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,932
You didn't think I was so
hideous that night we made out

329
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,972
in the back booth
at the Seafood Hut.

330
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,305
We all did crazy
things on 9/11.

331
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,931
Ah, here come the witches.

332
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,098
Do you have a statement
for us mortals?

333
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:59,646
Goddess Lilith, who knows
our hearts are pure...

334
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:04,152
ALL:
Oh, queen of magic, show our
persecutors that they are blind.

335
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,156
They are blind!

336
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,412
I'm blind! I'm blind!

337
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,662
What goes around,
comes around.

338
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,422
Dear, God, I've gone blind.

339
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,671
Nurse, you'll have
to be my eyes.

340
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,714
I'm blind, too!

341
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,377
Then I guess it's up to me.

342
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,426
{\an8}(gavel pounding)

343
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,640
Gwendolyn Nightshadow,

344
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,595
did you use
your supernatural powers

345
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,556
to blind half this town?

346
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,147
We're just kids.

347
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,781
My real name isn't even
Gwendolyn Nightshadow.

348
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,899
It's Stacey, Stacey Deathsatan.

349
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,236
(gallery gasps)

350
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,861
(thunder rumbles)

351
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,488
So...

352
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,874
the defendants recruited you,

353
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,792
a young innocent,
into their evil coven.

354
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,411
They're not evil!

355
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,378
They believe in friendship
and respecting the earth.

356
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,288
And they made me feel
like I belonged.

357
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,047
Your Honor, I'd like to enter
something into the record.

358
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,259
Strangely, I'll allow it.

359
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,879
Ladies and gentlemen,

360
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,756
I am a big dummy
with a stupid job.

361
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,012
I write down what
other people say,

362
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,934
just like a big dummy would.

363
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,142
Could the court reporter
read that back?

364
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,733
"I am a big dummy
with a stupid job"?!

365
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,269
-Hey!
-(chuckling)

366
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,816
In all my years
of being a judge,

367
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,478
I've never seen
such a flimsy case.

368
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,936
Are you sure?

369
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,986
'Cause we've brought you
a lot of flimsy cases.

370
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,820
Like that goat we accused
of income tax evasion.

371
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:31,946
I still think he was guilty.

372
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,242
♪♪

373
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,785
(goat bleating)

374
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,658
Well, I'm not wasting
another minute on this.

375
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,075
Case dismissed!

376
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,923
(relieved sighs)

377
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,789
There's no justice here.

378
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,585
They made me blind!

379
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,499
And now I can really
hear how I bomb!

380
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,297
Well, I say we take them out
and have our own trial!

381
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,052
(gallery clamoring)

382
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:50,974
(gunshots boom)

383
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,221
Oh, uh, don't mind me.

384
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,813
I'm just trying to get
a fly on the ceiling.

385
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,981
Ah, I got you now.

386
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,355
ALL (chanting):
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

387
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,823
Burn the witch!

388
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,282
Not so fast!

389
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,372
As citizens, we are still
bound by the rule of law.

390
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,529
ALL:
Boo!

391
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,446
17th century law!

392
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,615
(cheering)

393
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,833
I have reconstructed
the ultimate instrument

394
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:24,004
of colonial justice:
the dunking stool.

395
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,504
If the alleged witches
survive the dunking,

396
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,707
they clearly were witches!

397
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:32,177
If they drown, then they
were clearly innocent.

398
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,839
After this,
it will be featured

399
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,257
in the fifth-grade play,
<i>The Crucible.</i>

400
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,596
Good seats still available.

401
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,851
By which I mean, seats in the
back where you can fall asleep.

(mob gasping)

406
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,494
They didn't blind anyone.

407
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,741
I have proof!

408
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:54,822
(mob murmuring)

409
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,697
When my father was attending

410
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,494

411
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,867

Marge, please.

413
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,209
You're embarrassing me
in front of the mob.

414
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,921
...you heard sirens, which
you thought were police

415
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,671
coming to arrest you.

416
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,423

<i>also go temporarily blind.</i>

425
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,610
Moonshine in the water?

426
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,867
I'll be the judge of that.

00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,535

Wait, wait, wait, don't unform!
You're a great mob!

433
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,885
We'll think of something else
to get upset about!

434
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,521
How about all that construction
on Route One, huh?

435

-Huh?

436
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,602
Oh, you ain't no mob.

spineless weasels.

Now this is what
I'm talking about!

442

Sister Lisa, thank you
for saving us.

443
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,828
You were awesome.

444
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,449
No, thank you.

445
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,786
I've been rational
but nerdy my whole life.

446
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:28,462
But these past few weeks,
you girls made me feel cool.

447

Cool! Me, Lisa Simpson!

448
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,840
Well, I think you're
very interesting girls,

449
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,554
but from now on,

450
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,764
the only "witch"
in Lisa's life

451
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,055
is which boy
will marry her.

452
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,969
Right, Homer? Homer?

453
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,677
