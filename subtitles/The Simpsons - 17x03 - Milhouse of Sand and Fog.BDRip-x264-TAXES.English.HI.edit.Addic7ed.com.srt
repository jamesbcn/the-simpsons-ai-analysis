infect Rod and Todd?

known to hold "pox parties"

can get the disease
when they please.

for the privilege?

Hmm...

344
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,801
Well, I'd better go.

345
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,961
Where are you staying?

346
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,451
You know the Four Seasons?

347
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,170
Well, I'm experiencing
them firsthand

348
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,368
because I'm
living in the park.

349
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,282
Bart, I think you're
behind this whole thing.

350
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,044
Yeah, I can see
how you'd think that.

351
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,810
But on the other hand...
(GRUNTS)

352
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,802
Ha! I can read you
like a book.

353
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,325
Ha-ha. You read books.

354
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,564
If you don't tell Mom
what you did, I will.

355
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,241
AW, come on.

356
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,448
Wouldn't it be easier
if our parents divorced

357
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,522
and you compensated
by marrying much older men?

358
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,410
And meanwhile, I'll be one
of those weird guys who's 35

359
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,404
and shows up at high
school basketball games.

360
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,081
(SIGHS)

361
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,641
(GROANS)

362
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,050
Why did I marry
that selfish jerk?

363
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,004
I've asked him to flip the
mattress a thousand times

364
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,764
and he never does.

365
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,520
(GRUNTING)

366
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,050
Uh, Mom?
Hi, sweetie.

367
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,164
Uh, you know that bra
that broke up our family?

368
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,321
Uh-huh.

369
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,962
Well, I looked into it, and it
turns out I was responsible.

370
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,007
Really?

371
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,161
Well, just for that,

372
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,369
I'm gonna erase all the saved
games on your PlayStation.

373
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,807
What? How do you know
about things like that?

374
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,048
I learned about it in here.

375
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,441
Ha!

376
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,523
But Dad can come home, right?
No!

377
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,523
But he's innocent.
Innocent?

378
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,968
After all I do for your father,
he still doesn't trust me.

379
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,405
I'm finished with him!

380
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,644
Does this mean you and Dad
might get a D-A-V-U-R-S?

381
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,201
Young man, you go
work on your spelling

382
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,443
or I'll delete all the custom
ring tones from your cell phone.

383
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,847
No!

384
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,045
(SIGHS) Our reverse Parent Trap
just made everything worse.

385
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,885
Maybe we should use a
different movie <i>as</i> our guide.

386
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,530
<i>Like Oklahoma!</i>

387
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,162
(SINGING) <i>Oh, the farmer and
the cowman should be friends</i>

388
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,161
<i>Oh, the farmer and the cowman
should be friends</i>

389
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,562
<i>One man likes to push a plow</i>

390
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,210
<i>The other likes to chase a cow</i>

391
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,887
<i>But that's no reason
why they can't be friends</i>

392
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,322
What do you think, Bart? A hoedown
could solve all our problems.

393
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,768
I just need your chap size. lt's
two more than your pant size.

394
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,646
How many times do I have to tell
you no Rodgers & Hammerstein?

395
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,484
Rodgers and Hart?
No!

396
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,889
Well, what will trick your parents
into getting back together?

397
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,530
LISA: Enough
with the tricks!

398
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,011
Stupid movie schemes
do not work in real life!

399
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,362
Mom and Dad have a
marriage on the rocks.

400
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,930
And they need to work
through it in therapy

401
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,809
to make sure it
doesn't shatter.

402
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,003
Rocks. Shatter.
Jagged cliff!

403
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,890
Lise, you've just
given me an idea for

404
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,447
the most insane, harebrained,
foolproof scheme ever!

405
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,921
(SIGHS)

406
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,284
Okay, when my mom and dad see
this dummy fall in the river,

407
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,566
they'll think it's me.

408
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,211
And they'll realize what really matters.
Each other.

409
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,964
Do you like
the dummy, Bart?

410
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,042
I even made it
smell like you.

411
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,089
Now make sure
Homer and Marge

412
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,685
are in proper
viewing position.

413
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,007
So I got your note saying you
wanted to meet here to apologize.

414
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,525
Well, I got
your note saying

415
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,728
you were gonna bring me
a bucket of potato salad.

416
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,564
Where's my apology?

417
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,641
Where's my bucket?

418
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,165
Now I'll get Mom
and Dad's attention

419
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,651
and you shove
the dummy in the water.

420
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,960
Any questions?
Yeah.

421
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,684
What are you going
as for Halloween?

422
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,888
Pile of dog doo.
Let's roll.

423
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,729
Mom! Dad! I'm playing
on a dangerous cliff

424
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,690
because you're too busy arguing
to pay attention to me!

425
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,841
(GASPS)

426
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,844
Bart! We're all disappointed
there's no potato salad!

427
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,570
But for God's sake,
don’t jump!

428
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,681
Now!

429
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,240
I can't tell
which is which.

430
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,010
Oh, no! I'm already running!
(GRUNTS)

431

(GROANS)

432
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,167
Whoa!

433
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,969
I did it, Bart!

434
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,361
Bart?

435
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,201
(SCREAMING)

436
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,811

00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,006
This is all my fault.

441
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,560
I planted Mom's bra
on Milhouse's parents' bed.

442
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,246
Why, you little...
(CHOKING)

443
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,847
Homer, I can save you both.
Just let go of the rock.

444
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,244
Just do it! Trust me!

445
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,407
Okay.

Mom, Dad, I'd give
a kajillion dollars

448
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,000
for you to
get back together!

449
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,969
Make it two kajillion. Homer!

450
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,128
We'll lose the first
kajillion to taxes.

451
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,927
Well, I guess you showed
you do trust me after all.

452
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,286
Of course I do.

453
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,885
The only thing I can't believe

454
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,770
is that a woman as great as
you would be married to me.

455
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,365
Aw, Homie...

456
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,081

live in a world without Bart!
