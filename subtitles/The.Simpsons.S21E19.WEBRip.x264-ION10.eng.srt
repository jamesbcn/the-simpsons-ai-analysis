00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,878
We're gonna go check out
the wind damage.

178
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:28,875
Be careful!

179
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,506
If you see
a downed power line,

180
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,353
do whatever it is
people are supposed to do

181
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,849
in that situation.

182
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,181
(wind chimes tinkling)

183
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,557
Make it stop! Make it stop!

184
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,316
Look at the cool stuff
that washed up!

185
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,360
(gasps) Scuba goggles!

186
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,034
Oh, medical waste!

187
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,073
-(sad moans)
-BOTH: Hmm?

188
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,616
(gasps)

189
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,329
Whoa!

190
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,002
LISA: Oh, my God!

191
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,995
A beached whale!

192
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,503
(whale moaning sadly)

193
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,880
Bart, can you believe

194
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,886
that something so mighty has
been rendered so powerless?

195
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,010
I'm gonna have my next birthday
party on this thing.

196
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,017
(humming)

197
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,099
Whoa!

198
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,693
BART:
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

199
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,439
Whoa!

200
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,822
(whale moaning sadly)

201
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,861
She's such a beautiful shade
of blue.

202
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,735
I'm going to call you
Bluella the whale.

203
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,163
Hmm?

204
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,121
Check it out!
World's biggest armpit fart.

205
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,162
(loud fart noise)

206
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,866
You just made
a powerful enemy!

207
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,129
Come on, everybody!

208
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,550
A whale needs help!

209
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,048
Why should we?

210
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,170
Yeah, where was that whale
when my mom moved out?

211
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,007
Whales are mammals like us.

212
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,852
They're sensitive
and deeply intelligent.

213
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,048
(laughs)

214
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:57,888
Nerd!

215
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,562
(boys laugh)

216
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,140
I'm going to get real help.

217
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,595
Just try to keep her wet.

218
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,686
(moaning)

219
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,981
Hey, Milhouse!

220
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,025
Want to learn more
about whaling?

221
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,279
Sure!

222
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,200
-(grunting)
-(groaning)

223
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,279
Hey, Milhouse!

224
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,123
Want me
to "knock
it off?"

225
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,488
I'm afraid to answer that.

226
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,536
Never tell a bully
you're afraid.

227
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,120
-(grunting)
-(groaning)

228
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,167
(Marge sighs)

229
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,209
Our wedding
china's ruined.

230
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,463
Oh, we'll have to eat
Thanksgiving dinner

231
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,625
off regular plates like animals.

232
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,264
Hey, Mom, Dad,

233
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,721
there's a whale
on the beach.

234
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,300
You got to help me
get her back in the ocean.

235
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,756
(sighs)

236
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,636
All right. Let me
get my tool belt.

237
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,984
(grunting)

238
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,521
Man, who are these belts
made for, French super models?

239
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,856
(grunting)

240
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:51,861
(sighs)

241
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,532
Hurry, Dad, hurry!

242
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,991
(grunting)

243
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,321
Homie, can I talk
to you for a second?

244
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,156
Sure. Lisa,
bring the car around.

245
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,531
But I don't know how to drive.

246
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,578
Haven't you
learned anything

247
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,831
from watching
Bart drive?

248
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,622
A little.

249
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,205
Homie, I happened to
read about beached whales

250
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,961
in <i>Springfield</i>
<i>Geographic.</i>

251
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,963
It usually does
not end well.

252
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,434
-We can't let Lisa
get her hopes up.
-(car horn toots twice)

253
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,139
Marge, how hard
can it be?

254
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,549
We're just rolling it
into the ocean from the beach.

255
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,308
It's not like it's stuck
in the bottom of a well

256
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,481
or in a Mexican prison.

257
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,978
(gasps)

258
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,020
But that would make
a great movie.

259
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,149
(laughs)

260
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,532
Lisa is very sensitive.

261
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,399
If something she loves
dies in front of her...

262
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,237
That whale's not gonna die.

263
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,822
We're busting him
out of prison,

264
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,487
no matter what you say,
Escobar!

265
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,235
God, this thing
writes itself.

266
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,827
(car horn toots twice)

267
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,622
Coming!

268
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,996
(tool belt squeaking)

269
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,843
Okay, we'll need
the town's strongest men

270
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,379
to roll the whale back
in the water.

271
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,173
(all grunting)

272
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,177
(groaning)

273
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,470
Hmm. We need
a better idea.

274
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,024
We'll have to find
our ten smartest men.

275
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,639
(straining mightily)

276
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,228
It's hard to believe

277
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,856
anyone in that contest
can be considered smart.

278
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,864
(moaning)

279
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,696
One... two...

280
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,412
three... tug!

281
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,952
(engines revving)

282
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,036
Aah.

283
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,423
(whistling)

284
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,750
Lisa, sweetheart,

285
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,166
it's almost dinner time.

286
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,764
Why don't you come home?

287
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,759
I'll catch up with you guys
in a little bit.

288
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,509
You know, when I'm sad,

289
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,346
I read something beautiful
and true-- poetry.

290
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,392
(sad moans)

291
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,555
No, no, you're gonna like it.

292
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,853
It's about the ocean.

293
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,726
"The world below the brine.

294
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,903
Forests at the bottom
of the sea.

295
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,112
The branches and leaves..."

296
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,743
(yawns)

297
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,239
"Sea-lettuce, vast lichens..."

298
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,778
BART:
Wake up, Lis!

299
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,076
They're doing it!

300
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,789
(gasps)

301
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,659
Dorsal straps secured!

302
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,286
Tail clamps
in position!

303
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,792
Congratulatory
T-shirts

304
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,044
silk-screened
and distributed!

305
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,335
Oh!

306
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,588
Operation Desert Ocean is a go!

307
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,630
Let's get this lady fish
into the blue zone!

308
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,795
It was <i>my </i>idea to
put the whale in the water.

309
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,965
Girl, you're
going home!

310
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,644
You're
going home!

311
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,685
Good-bye, Bluella!

312
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,732
Send me a post card
from Tierra Del Fuego.

313
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,897
Good-bye! Good-bye!

314
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,990
(ecstatic whale sounds)

315
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,696
Huh?

316
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,460
(groans, then gasps)

317
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,329
Bluella?

318
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,214
(gasps)

319
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,132
Oh, no. (gasps)

320
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,007
(sobbing quietly)

321
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,675
Don't worry, honey.

322
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,847
Right now she's lying
on God's beach.

323
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,186
She doesn't like lying
on the beach.

324
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,732
She likes being in the ocean.

325
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,145
Oh, Lisa, I'm sorry.

326
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,614
I tried my best.

327
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,034
I know it's really hard

328
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,072
when you discover
your dad isn't perfect.

329
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,275
Not perfect?

330
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,655
You can say
that again.

331
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,081
I'm trying
to be a sensitive father,

332
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,200
you unwanted moron!

333
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,828
Lisa, where were we?

334
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,424
Maybe I should just
be alone a little bit.

335
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Of course.

336
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,342
Oh, it kills me
to see her like that.

337
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,974
And if there's one thing
I can't stand,

338
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,931
it's being killed.

339
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:48,932
(yawns)

340
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,849
Milhouse, this'll be
the biggest dead animal

341
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,354
we ever poked with a stick.

342
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,936
If that flattened squirrel

343
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,071
we poked last week
could only see us now.

344
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,529
(crowd murmuring)

345
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,908
All right, back
up, everybody.

346
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,330
Oh, but not too much.

347
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,078
You are definitely
gonna want to see this.

348
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,661
(explosion)

349
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:19,211
So clean, how part of it
just disappears like that.

350
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,883
Ah! Yuck!

351
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,763
(explosion)

352
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,721
(screaming and shouting)

353
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,801
(groaning and grunting)

354
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:34,681
Citizens, today
we honor Bluella the whale,

355
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,517
along with the victims
of the Great Whale Explosion.

356
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,063
(explosion)

357
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,816
Could you please
stop dynamiting?!

358
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,689
CHIEF WIGGUM:
Sorry. I sat on the plunger.

359
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,816
But Bluella will live on
among us

360
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,993
as we make use
of every part of her body,

361
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,623
from blowhole to fluke.

362
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,870
<i>♪ And we did not</i>
<i>catch the whale,</i>
<i>brave boys... ♪</i>

363
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:59,754
<i>♪ And we did not</i>
<i>touch the whale... ♪</i>

364
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,633
Behold, I am Captain Kirk
from <i>Star Trek One.</i>

365
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,882
<i>Two.</i>

366
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,884
<i>Five. Generations.</i>

367
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,676
<i>Boston Legal.</i>

368
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,143
Now, Lisa,

369
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,680
I know you miss
your whale.

370
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,143
so I got you a pet
that will never die.

371
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,604
An invisible dog.

372
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,404
Aw, look.
He's doing his business.

373
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,898
Hey! Not on the rug!

374
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,230
You bad dog!

375
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,944
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Ooh!

376
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,444
Stop biting my leg!

377
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,946
Ow! All right, that's it.
You're going outside.

378
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,108
(sighs)

379
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,527
HOMER:
Bad dog, stop!

380
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,825
(loud creaking)

381
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,579
Bluella?

382
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,161
Oh, hey, there, Lisa.

383
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,286
Just oiling the
old door here.

384
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,133
Finally silenced
that mournful wail.

385
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,089
(sad moaning)

386
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,749
-(gasps)
-(moaning)

387
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,128
Oh.

388
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,804
(squeaking)

389
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,222
Huh?

390
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:54,721
(loud pop)

391
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,175
(sighs)

392
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,887
(squeaking)

393
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,776
(whale song)

394
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,109
No. I'm not gonna be
disappointed again.

395
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,579
-(squeaking)
-Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!

396
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,198
(amazed gasp)

397
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,325
(panting)

398
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,420
(gasps)
They must be Bluella's children!

399
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,251
Hello, whale calves!

400
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,507
Your mother lives on
through you! Huh?

401
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,052
Run! I mean, swim!

402
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,546
I mean...

403
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,597
(makes urgent
whale moaning sounds)

404
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,689
Those baby whales are doomed,
just like their mom.

405
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,114
Oh!

406
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,902
I guess it's just nature's way.

407
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,945
(boat approaching)

408
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,949
Nature is a toothless,
dying hag.

409
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,781
We are gonna save
those whale babies!

410
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,497
Dad? Where did you get
that boat?

411
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,208
I'm taking it on a test drive
from the boat store. Get in.

412
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,753
<i>Shark Week</i>
just got canceled.

413
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,417
Drop the 'poon!

414
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,967
Oh, come on! Leave me alone!

415
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,340
I'm trying
to save your precious whales!

416
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,177
We're not here
to protect the whales.

417
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,682
{\an8}We're here
to protect the sharks.

418
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,934
{\an8}Did you know that
over 40 million sharks

419
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,436
are slaughtered every year
to make shark-fin soup?

420
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,729
(mutters)
You like sharks?

421
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,153
Being a true eco-activist
means supporting

422
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,192
every animal's
struggle for life.

423
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,025
Except for
cockroaches. Yuck!

424
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,361
Linda, please.

425
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:37,905
Puh! Typical eco-jerks--
using words to talk.

426
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,911
Dad, no!
They're right.

427
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,917
If the only way
to save the whales

428
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,629
is to kill
another innocent creature,

429
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,089
I can't let you do it.

430
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,049
Sharks, innocent? Please.

431
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,091
Every year, they kill
a couple of people

432
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,724
who do a series
of stupid things.

433
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,391
A shark's reptilian brain

434
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,049
understands only one thing--

435
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,968
the crime of murder.

436
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,476
(yells, shouting)

437
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,811
(gasping)

438
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:13,283
Dad! The sharks must
think you're a baby whale.

439
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,150
HOMER:
Ooh, a <i>baby </i>whale.

440
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,157
My diet <i>is </i>working.

441
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,409
Why couldn't I be eaten
by a giraffe?

442
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,201
That would be fun.

443
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,945
Gently bonk the shark
on the nose with this.

444
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,997
It'll either make him go away
or eat you quicker.

445
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,082
D'oh! Huh?

446
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,248
Ooh, maybe the blood
will scare the sharks off.

447
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,763
(screaming)

448
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,509
(Homer gasps, whales bellowing)

449
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,556
LISA:
It's the baby
whales' dad!

450
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,180
Thanks, buddy!

451
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:49,017
(bellowing)

452
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,064
Thanks for not letting
me give up, Dad.

453
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:55,188
Hey, I'd do anything
for a sweet, intelligent mammal,

454
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,027
by which I mean you.

455
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,742
Oh.

456
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,156
Do you think
they'll be okay?

457
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,544
Absolutely.

458
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,081
He's young, he's got
two cute kids.

459
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,335
He'll be moving in with
a sexy lady octopus in no time.

460
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,208
They'll have to sell
their old place.

461
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,335
Too many memories.

462
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,881
But if I'm not mistaken,

463
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,224
there's a little
whale-a-puss on the way.

464
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,510
(chuckling)

465
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,303
Tonight let's all
draw pictures

466
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,676
