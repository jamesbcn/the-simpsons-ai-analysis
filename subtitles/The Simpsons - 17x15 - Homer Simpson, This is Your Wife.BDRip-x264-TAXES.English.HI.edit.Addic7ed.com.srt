they think is the least reprehensible.

I don't understand, Dad.

188

Our family has
so many flaws.

189
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,208
Why must we share
them with the world?

190
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,850

earn enough money to buy a TV!

you do for a living?

Yes. Yes. Yes,
I do, actually.

Does that include the
people and the furniture?

224
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,443
Yeah. And I decide where
the Christmas party's held.

225
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,891
Actually, it's decided
by committee,

That song was very nice.

How'd you think up
so many rhyming words?

362
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,126
Marge, I love you!

363
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,680
And I can tell from your
basic level of courtesy

364
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,841
that you love me, too.

365
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,924
What? No!
Listen, Charles,

366
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,923
I don't want to
hurt your feelings...

367
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,729
Because you love me,
right? Admit it.

368
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,690
We were born to fall into each
others arms on reality TV!

369
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,286
I'm sorry,
but I love Homer.

your son might see this!

He's not my son!

I've narrowed it down to.
Pretty sure.

380
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,723
Mmm. There, there.

381
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,689
God, I miss Homer.

382
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,086
I miss him, too.

383
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,766
What is it about him that
is so damned irresistible?

384
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,449
Well, he's loved me ever since
the first moment he saw me.

385
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,931
And he's never stopped.

386
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,082
And whatever it takes
to make me happy,

387
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,128
he'll do it,
even if it kills him.

388
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,089
Sorry, I ran out of tape just before
that beautiful speech of hers.

389
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,447
But I got a great shot of him
saying his son's a bastard.

Let's go home, sweetie.

I'm sure there's a hamper
full of Homer waiting for me.

398

Oh, Marge,
thank God you're back!

413
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,091
She made me spend
time with the kids!

leaving me for him?

Words and chords.

446
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,769
Not the poetry
and the real thing,

447
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,525
but not bad for an ad-lib.

448
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,443
Not good. But...

449
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,523
And it's not long enough.
So just do a little bit more.
