1
00:00:08,845 --> 00:00:10,278
D'oh!

2
00:01:11,117 --> 00:01:12,518
We're unbalanced!

3
00:01:12,585 --> 00:01:13,919
It's not fair!

4
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:20,859
I'd like to call to order
this secret conclave

5
00:01:20,927 --> 00:01:22,427
of America's media empires.

6
00:01:22,495 --> 00:01:24,029
We are here to come up with

7
00:01:24,097 --> 00:01:25,864
the next phony
baloney crisis

8
00:01:25,932 --> 00:01:27,566
to put Americans back
where they belong--

9
00:01:27,634 --> 00:01:29,601
in dark rooms,
glued to their televisions,

10
00:01:29,669 --> 00:01:31,436
too terrified to skip
the commercials.

11
00:01:31,504 --> 00:01:33,238
Well, I think...
NBC, you are here

12
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:35,374
to listen and not speak!

13
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:37,376
I think we should go with
a good old-fashioned

14
00:01:37,443 --> 00:01:38,443
public health scare.

15
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,047
A new disease!
No one's immune!

16
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:43,415
It's like the summer
of the shark,

17
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:45,417
except instead of a shark,
it's an epidemic...

18
00:01:45,485 --> 00:01:47,452
and instead of summer,
it's all the time!

19
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,687
That is smokin'!

20
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:50,556
Now I hate to be
the guy who derails

21
00:01:50,623 --> 00:01:51,757
what everybody else loves...

22
00:01:51,824 --> 00:01:53,725
He loves being that guy.

23
00:01:53,793 --> 00:01:56,395
But, Janice,
we do have standards.

24
00:01:56,462 --> 00:01:58,297
This can't be
a made-up disease.

25
00:01:58,364 --> 00:02:00,132
The only moral thing to do

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,834
is release a deadly virus
into the general public.

27
00:02:02,902 --> 00:02:05,037
We do have something
we've been holding onto,

28
00:02:05,104 --> 00:02:06,271
but it hasn't been tested.

29
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:07,639
Get over here, NBC.

30
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:11,743
Well, we certainly
believe in testing,

31
00:02:11,811 --> 00:02:13,812
but I... Oh!

32
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:18,016
Wow. Wow!
Oh, yeah!

33
00:02:18,084 --> 00:02:20,152
So, we've got
our deadly disease.

34
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,421
Now we just have to
blame it on something

35
00:02:22,488 --> 00:02:24,590
that's in every household...

36
00:02:24,657 --> 00:02:27,226
something that people are a
little bit afraid of already.

37
00:02:27,293 --> 00:02:29,861
Housecat Flu is coming, people!

38
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:31,363
The Center for Disease
Disinformation predicts

39
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:33,031
with some degree of probability

40
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:35,934
that the Housecat Flu might
spread in the following

41
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:37,502
hypothetical outbreak pattern.

42
00:02:39,138 --> 00:02:42,507
So better beware, that warm body
on your lap just might be

43
00:02:42,575 --> 00:02:44,943
ready to destroy
<i>your</i> tender vittles.

44
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:54,019
Springfielders are advised to
stay tuned for more information

45
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:56,021
if they experience any of the
following symptoms:

46
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:59,157
mild thirst, occasional hunger,
tiredness at night...

47
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,829
You know, I don't know <i>when</i> this
was ever a good idea.

48
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,989
Hurry up, boy!

49
00:03:14,057 --> 00:03:16,091
We have to burn
everything the cat touched,

50
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,577
before the virus
makes us paranoid!

51
00:03:22,882 --> 00:03:24,349
Homer!

52
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:26,652
Stop burning!

53
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,454
They have a vaccine!

54
00:03:29,522 --> 00:03:32,257
All right.
We'll get the vaccine.

55
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:38,297
Homer, did you know
he was in the pile?

56
00:03:38,364 --> 00:03:40,999
I thought he was
an old clump of rags.

57
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,537
Don't worry, people.

58
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:47,773
We have enough
vaccines for...

59
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,175
one child per family.

60
00:03:50,243 --> 00:03:51,943
I don't even have a kid
that I admit to having.

61
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:54,246
Please use your time
in line wisely

62
00:03:54,314 --> 00:03:56,515
to "Sophie's Choice" your child.

63
00:03:56,582 --> 00:03:58,483
What a crook!

64
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,324
This isn't the line
for a movie.

65
00:04:05,391 --> 00:04:07,092
Why are you wearing
that costume?

66
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,096
Because, you see, I am afraid of
needles, but Wolverine is not.

67
00:04:11,164 --> 00:04:13,081
Snikt! Snikt!

68
00:04:16,386 --> 00:04:18,420
Need...
acceptable currency... Ooh...

69
00:04:18,504 --> 00:04:20,672
for delicious treat... Ooh!

70
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:28,714
Mr. Burns?
Where's he going?

71
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,789
Yes, I'd like 37 snifters
of your influenza syrup.

72
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:41,893
One for me, one for Smithers
here and the rest for my hounds.

73
00:04:41,961 --> 00:04:45,597
Give him what he wants. He's the
only taxpayer in this town.

74
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:48,367
But Mr. Mayor, these people
have waited in line.

75
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:50,335
And dogs can't even
get the disease.

76
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:53,238
They'll see me take it
and they'll want some.

77
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:56,675
Yes 'oo will. Yes 'oo will,
you little jelly belly.

78
00:04:56,743 --> 00:04:58,710
Sir, perhaps we should
get out of here,

79
00:04:58,778 --> 00:05:00,379
before people start
resenting you.

80
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:05,550
Hooh! Hurry up and get in!
I'll drive.

81
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:13,692
Hurry, everyone!
Roll in the shards!

82
00:05:15,294 --> 00:05:17,963
Come on! Like this!

83
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,798
Healthy.
Gettin' healthy. Ow!

84
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:22,601
Gettin' healthy...
and very sleepy.

85
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:31,510
Ahh!

86
00:05:31,577 --> 00:05:34,246
I feel as hail
and hearty as an eohippus.

87
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:38,016
Eh, Mr. Burns, I did a little
blood work earlier today

88
00:05:38,084 --> 00:05:41,219
and I'm afraid I've got
a bit of hard news.

89
00:05:41,287 --> 00:05:43,221
Spit it out, Doctor!
I haven't got all day.

90
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:44,856
Eh, you certainly don't.

91
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:47,125
You see, I'm
afraid you're dying.

92
00:05:47,193 --> 00:05:48,994
Dying?!

93
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:51,663
Yes. It's a number
of factors, really:

94
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:55,066
whooping cough, hectic fever,
cancrum otis,

95
00:05:55,134 --> 00:06:00,172
Wellington's ooze, the Lambeth
plague, and skull collapse.

96
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:02,174
How long do I have?

97
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:04,810
Five, six weeks tops.

98
00:06:04,877 --> 00:06:06,311
You might live to see

99
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:09,014
the Wheat-Eared Warbler return
to Swinton Park.

100
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:11,383
But I wouldn't count on it.

101
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:15,220
You... want me to tell
the employees, sir?

102
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:17,956
No. It's better that
they hear it from me.

103
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:21,359
I'll tell them the truth
in the simplest way I know how.

104
00:06:34,407 --> 00:06:36,875
Aw, why did Burns
make us all come here?

105
00:06:36,943 --> 00:06:38,877
I bet he's got something
up his sleeve.

106
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:42,080
I don't like that he hired
a band to play ominous music.

107
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,192
Good evening. I have very sad
news for all of you.

108
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:58,830
Or maybe he's going to
jack up our electric rates.

109
00:06:58,898 --> 00:07:02,434
Whew! I will have to
hand-crank my wiener warmer.

110
00:07:02,502 --> 00:07:05,937
Hand-crank my wiener warmer!

111
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:08,039
The truth is...
I'm dying.

112
00:07:09,342 --> 00:07:10,842
Hell, yeah!

113
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,744
Finally, a break
for the black man!

114
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:14,479
This better not
be a gag!

115
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:17,282
It's not!
My days are Roman-numeraled!

116
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:20,719
Stop this!
Stop this at once, or I'll...

117
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:23,355
Or what? You're just gonna
die soon anyway!

118
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:26,424
I'm warning you!

119
00:07:26,492 --> 00:07:29,261
You are making a
very powerful temporary enemy!

120
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:31,296
Sir, you'd better not
rile them up.

121
00:07:31,364 --> 00:07:34,866
The first course is oysters on the half shell.

122
00:07:36,502 --> 00:07:39,671
I see.
I'm well and truly hated.

123
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:41,973
However, you will
change your tune

124
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,476
when you see the legacy
I'm leaving behind me.

125
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:46,645
I'm leaving all my money
to an orchard

126
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:51,182
that will grow inedible
"me"-shaped fruits.

127
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,685
They're as addictive
as they are poisonous.

128
00:07:58,658 --> 00:07:59,975
Melt his ice sculpture!

129
00:08:04,163 --> 00:08:05,630
It's starting to drip!

130
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:10,669
♪ La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la... ♪

131
00:08:10,736 --> 00:08:12,737
I haven't a friend
in the world.

132
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:14,139
You have me, sir.

133
00:08:14,206 --> 00:08:15,740
I pay you, Smithers.

134
00:08:15,808 --> 00:08:17,509
No kind of love can come

135
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:18,643
from one man
paying another.

136
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:19,911
Well, but there's...

137
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:21,746
I'll just retire to my bed.

138
00:08:21,814 --> 00:08:25,417
Uh... that's where we put
everyone's coats.

139
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:28,253
Shred them in the wood chipper,
and use the rags to wax my car.

140
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:37,696
Why does everyone hate me?

141
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,565
Sir, what are
you doing?

142
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:59,236
Smithers, I want to die quietly,
on my own terms...

143
00:08:59,304 --> 00:09:03,474
crushing as many of those baby
sea turtles as I possibly can.

144
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,010
Good-bye,
insufficiently cruel world!

145
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:08,012
Oh, no...

146
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,893
Anthill, wasp nest,
moose poop, Mr. Burns...

147
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,194
Mr. Burns?!

148
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:40,531
My poop stick has
brought him back to life!

149
00:09:40,598 --> 00:09:43,033
But which end?

150
00:09:44,435 --> 00:09:45,302
What do you want?

151
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,538
Come on, man, leave me alone.

152
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:49,573
Friend?

153
00:09:49,641 --> 00:09:52,409
You my mommy-daddy-puppy?

154
00:09:52,477 --> 00:09:54,811
Whoa! Your brains
have turned to oatmeal!

155
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,047
My name Oatmeal?

156
00:09:57,115 --> 00:09:59,349
This is too weird, man.

157
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:02,503
Wait for Oatmeal!

158
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:14,264
Oh! What am I gonna
do with you?

159
00:10:16,901 --> 00:10:18,835
Look, I know
you're cool now,

160
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:20,904
but my dad hates you
more than celery,

161
00:10:20,972 --> 00:10:24,074
and my mom said no new pets,
so I'm hiding you in my room.

162
00:10:24,142 --> 00:10:26,843
Oatmeal accept premise.

163
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:28,879
Bart, who are you talking to?

164
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:36,053
And what's all that noise?

165
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,388
Ah, I'm playing with my
Sergeant Activity Doll.

166
00:10:38,456 --> 00:10:40,457
Why not buy another of me?

167
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:44,861
Hmm.

168
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,468
Well, okay.

169
00:10:59,444 --> 00:11:01,445
Okay, okay!
I'll find you some food.

170
00:11:01,512 --> 00:11:04,314
Me not feel good.

171
00:11:10,288 --> 00:11:12,389
Hey pal, you look like
you lost your best friend.

172
00:11:12,457 --> 00:11:14,558
Mm. He was
more than a friend.

173
00:11:14,626 --> 00:11:17,561
He was the reason I got up
in the morning.

174
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:20,264
Because he would inject me
with coffee at 6:00 a.m.

175
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:22,366
in the back of the head.

176
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:25,068
My new boss
will never take his place!

177
00:11:25,136 --> 00:11:27,004
New boss, huh?
What's he like?

178
00:11:27,071 --> 00:11:30,674
Oh, a lot like my old boss.

179
00:11:30,742 --> 00:11:32,209
Ruthless.
Went to Yale.

180
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:34,111
Made a fortune in energy.

181
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:36,179
Basically hairless.
Oh, yeah.

182
00:11:36,247 --> 00:11:38,215
He likes to stack men naked.

183
00:11:38,283 --> 00:11:39,516
I guess that's a start.

184
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:47,624
A philanthropist, a
humanitarian, a man of peace...

185
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:49,810
these are among the people
who've come today

186
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,979
to spit in Montgomery Burns'
open grave.

187
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:56,800
The fact that Burns'
37-pound body was never found

188
00:11:56,868 --> 00:11:59,903
did nothing to lessen the
salivary salvos.

189
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:01,938
Hold, please.

190
00:12:03,675 --> 00:12:05,342
You may continue.

191
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,412
I hope they use that spit
for a good cause,

192
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:10,414
like sealing
wedding envelopes.

193
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:13,517
Or helping a railroad worker
grip his sledgehammer!

194
00:12:13,584 --> 00:12:15,719
Now they're dancing
on his grave!

195
00:12:15,787 --> 00:12:17,270
Dance, you sons of bitches!

196
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:19,489
Dance like it's me down there!

197
00:12:19,557 --> 00:12:22,426
Thank God Mr. Burns
isn't alive to see this.

198
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:23,727
Come back!

199
00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:26,229
I'm not finished
giving you your bath!

200
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:40,766
Attack during their
sacred holiday!

201
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:45,852
Hmm, apparently Mr. Burns
is in a state of shock

202
00:12:45,952 --> 00:12:47,452
from the trauma
he underwent.

203
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,054
Oh man, this is great!

204
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:51,723
The most evil man in town
is in our power.

205
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:55,560
He will do my bidding...

206
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:58,396
at that fantasy football
auction.

207
00:12:58,464 --> 00:13:02,968
And anything else my limited
imagination can come up with.

208
00:13:10,443 --> 00:13:12,577
Just because Mr. Burns
was mean to you,

209
00:13:12,645 --> 00:13:15,847
that doesn't give you the right
to abuse him when he's helpless.

210
00:13:15,915 --> 00:13:18,149
Marge, it's the golden rule:

211
00:13:18,217 --> 00:13:20,719
treat others the way
they mess with you.

212
00:13:20,786 --> 00:13:22,554
It's not up to you.

213
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:24,990
We're going to take him
to our moral and civic leaders.

214
00:13:25,057 --> 00:13:26,858
They'll know
the right thing to do.

215
00:13:26,926 --> 00:13:29,494
All those in favor
of treating Mr. Burns

216
00:13:29,562 --> 00:13:31,930
the way he messed
with us, say "aye."

217
00:13:31,998 --> 00:13:34,266
Aye!
People of Springfield!

218
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,001
To quote Shakespeare,

219
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:38,937
"The quality of mercy
is not strained."

220
00:13:39,005 --> 00:13:39,738
Boo!

221
00:13:39,805 --> 00:13:41,406
You know, it takes a lot

222
00:13:41,474 --> 00:13:44,709
for an eight-year-old to stand
up in front of the whole town!

223
00:13:44,777 --> 00:13:47,879
Eight-year-old? I always
thought you were a midget!

224
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:51,850
We're called "little people,"
and I'm not one.

225
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:53,885
People of Springfield,
as a nerd,

226
00:13:53,953 --> 00:13:56,955
I understand your desire
for revenge,

227
00:13:57,023 --> 00:13:59,524
but this sweet, harmless man

228
00:13:59,592 --> 00:14:03,628
is not the same remorseless
monster who tormented us all.

229
00:14:03,696 --> 00:14:05,330
He's close enough!

230
00:14:05,398 --> 00:14:07,165
Yeah, Seaside Heights
ain't Maui,

231
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:09,734
but, uh, you take
what you can get. Whoa!

232
00:14:15,107 --> 00:14:17,542
You done pullin' the wings
off of those bees?

233
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,544
Almost, Mr. Vice President.

234
00:14:19,612 --> 00:14:21,880
May I ask why I'm doing this?

235
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:23,915
I don't know.
I'm bored.

236
00:14:23,983 --> 00:14:25,951
When my old boss got bored,
he liked to listen

237
00:14:26,018 --> 00:14:28,553
to Thomas Edison reciting
"Mary Had a Little Lamb"

238
00:14:28,621 --> 00:14:29,788
on a wax cylinder.

239
00:14:29,855 --> 00:14:32,223
What do you think I am,
1,000 years old?

240
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:35,160
I got a myPod
full of Lee Greenwood.

241
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:44,002
Now boy, everyone
in town gets Burns

242
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,271
for half an hour
to do as they will.

243
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:49,374
This town can't teach its kids
or collect its garbage,

244
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:52,177
but we lead the nation in
pointless revenge.

245
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:54,879
Amen.
Oh!

246
00:14:54,947 --> 00:14:57,649
Okay, Burnsie,
follow the carrot!

247
00:15:12,932 --> 00:15:15,266
Dad! You're gonna
wreck him for everybody!

248
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:18,470
Don't worry, boy.
Another girder always swings in

249
00:15:18,537 --> 00:15:21,373
for you to walk on right
when you get to the end.

250
00:15:24,744 --> 00:15:25,994
Where's the other girder?

251
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:26,945
Ow!

252
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:30,332
Okay, here's your choice:

253
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,934
cash in my hands
or blood on the jerky.

254
00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:36,121
I believe you want
the assistant manager, sir.

255
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:38,990
Oh, I can't shoot him.
I've got him next.

256
00:15:39,058 --> 00:15:41,693
Well, that is your bad luck,
because he is mine right now.

257
00:15:41,761 --> 00:15:44,229
Come back in half an hour.
He can be your accomplice.

258
00:15:44,296 --> 00:15:46,097
I was going to
take him ice skating.

259
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:47,032
What was that?

260
00:15:47,099 --> 00:15:47,932
Nothing.

261
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,734
What was that?
Ice skating?

262
00:15:49,802 --> 00:15:52,337
Do you do axels
and Salchows?

263
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:54,139
What do you do?

264
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:59,611
Check out my new dad!
Sorry, lame-o!

265
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:03,281
It's 2:00, which makes him my
Uncle Ed for an hour.

266
00:16:03,349 --> 00:16:06,351
No, it's Saturday, which makes
him that guy at the Youth Center

267
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:08,053
who really believes in me.

268
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,789
There's still time for me to
turn my life around, right?

269
00:16:12,224 --> 00:16:14,726
It's not that easy, man!

270
00:16:19,732 --> 00:16:20,565
All yours.

271
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:22,000
What did you do with him?

272
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:24,269
Found a way
to use him as a bong.

273
00:16:30,576 --> 00:16:33,278
Dad, Mr. Burns is here
for you again.

274
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:34,979
Already?

275
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:37,315
A little tired of revenge,
are we?

276
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:41,453
Yeah, I've done all I can do
in that medium.

277
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,322
All right. Mr. Burns,
I'm going to show you

278
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,459
that not all of us in this town
are vindictive and cruel.

279
00:16:47,526 --> 00:16:49,794
Not today.

280
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:57,252
I thought,
after all you went through,

281
00:16:57,336 --> 00:16:59,170
you just might want to
spend an hour

282
00:16:59,221 --> 00:17:01,089
in a place where
you felt at home.

283
00:17:01,173 --> 00:17:03,274
Lots of room for friends.

284
00:17:03,342 --> 00:17:07,011
Actually, sir, the man who lived
here didn't have many friends.

285
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,781
But you're a better person
than he ever was.

286
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,054
That's me!

287
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:17,922
Yes, technically it's you.

288
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,657
But like I said,
people change.

289
00:17:19,725 --> 00:17:22,527
And they can also
bloody well change back!

290
00:17:26,265 --> 00:17:29,067
Daddy's home.

291
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,214
I don't have time for the
papers, Smithers.

292
00:17:39,282 --> 00:17:41,717
Any terrorist attacks on
American soil today?

293
00:17:41,784 --> 00:17:44,519
I'm sorry, but no.
Oh...

294
00:17:44,587 --> 00:17:45,988
Smithers!

295
00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:49,057
Trading me in
for a younger model, I see.

296
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,859
Mr. Burns!
You're alive!

297
00:17:50,927 --> 00:17:53,495
I'm so happy
I could... hug you!

298
00:17:53,563 --> 00:17:55,897
And me smell like
drugstore cologne

299
00:17:55,965 --> 00:17:58,166
the rest of the day?
I don't think so.

300
00:17:58,234 --> 00:18:01,436
You may hug... my shadow.

301
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:05,440
Oh, Mr. Vice President...

302
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:09,111
I've loved this time we've spent
in this dormant volcano, but...

303
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:10,345
You're leaving me,
aren't you?

304
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:12,147
I... I am.

305
00:18:12,215 --> 00:18:14,850
You realize that every time
I don't get what I want,

306
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:16,284
Al Qaeda wins?

307
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:18,120
Can I go now?
Yes.

308
00:18:18,187 --> 00:18:20,389
I just need
to erase your memory.

309
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,598
Attention, insects!

310
00:18:29,665 --> 00:18:31,800
The foot of reckoning
has arrived!

311
00:18:33,886 --> 00:18:35,570
Hey there, Mr. Burns!

312
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:37,939
For our half hour, I thought
we'd have a picnic in the park.

313
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:40,008
Silence, you sadistic monster!

314
00:18:40,076 --> 00:18:41,643
I've got my memory back,

315
00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:44,179
and I'm going to wreak a
terrible vengeance.

316
00:18:44,247 --> 00:18:46,348
Taking an idea I got
from a Stephen King book,

317
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,718
I'm going to cover this town
with a dome!

318
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:55,023
It's been done!

319
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:56,391
Really?

320
00:18:56,459 --> 00:18:58,193
You don't say.

321
00:18:58,261 --> 00:18:59,494
Did you know about this?

322
00:18:59,562 --> 00:19:00,695
Mm-hmm.

323
00:19:00,763 --> 00:19:01,963
I see.

324
00:19:05,802 --> 00:19:09,471
Well, what if I cover
you all with...

325
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:12,007
a cube of bulletproof
plexiglas?!

326
00:19:12,075 --> 00:19:14,376
Uh, it's pretty much
the same thing.

327
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,344
Plus we could always
dig ourselves out,

328
00:19:16,412 --> 00:19:18,680
although that never seems
to occur to anybody.

329
00:19:18,748 --> 00:19:21,183
Set 'er down, Smithers.

330
00:19:23,586 --> 00:19:27,622
Mr. Burns, you can't hurt us
after all we've done for you.

331
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,591
What the devil
are you talking about?

332
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:31,693
You were given
six weeks to live,

333
00:19:31,761 --> 00:19:33,462
and you've outlived it!

334
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:35,831
I think what kept you alive

335
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:40,035
was that for once in your life
you were helping other people.

336
00:19:41,704 --> 00:19:43,004
Could it be?

337
00:19:43,072 --> 00:19:45,740
Perhaps kindness did
keep me alive.

338
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:48,477
Young man, would you like
a lemon drop?

339
00:19:48,544 --> 00:19:49,811
Mmm!

340
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:02,724
It wasn't kindness that was
keeping me alive,

341
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:05,527
it was bile
building up inside!

342
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:09,264
Loathing is my life blood,
and rage my royal jelly!

343
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:12,501
So yes, thank you,
Springfield, for giving me

344
00:20:12,568 --> 00:20:14,903
the secret to eternal life--
hate!

345
00:20:14,971 --> 00:20:17,339
You're welcome!

346
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,244
What are you doing here?

347
00:20:22,311 --> 00:20:24,379
You were my father
for two hours,

348
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,349
and I'm not letting
this dad get away!

349
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,917
Oh! Preposterous!

350
00:20:28,985 --> 00:20:30,886
I won't be Bismarcked
into fathering anyone!

351
00:20:30,953 --> 00:20:32,387
Listen, old man.

352
00:20:32,455 --> 00:20:34,656
I need someone to
cheer me on in the school play.

353
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:36,224
And it's gonna be you,

354
00:20:36,292 --> 00:20:39,828
or this copter's goin' down!

355
00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:41,246
You know I'll do it!

356
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,802
Thank God your son can't see
the way you're behaving.

357
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,472
My son?
My son?!

358
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,075
The truth is...
I don't have a son!

359
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,512
Haw-haw!
Haw-haw!

360
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,182
Haw-haw!

361
00:21:00,249 --> 00:21:03,018
That's my boy!

362
00:21:49,082 --> 00:21:50,202
Shh!
