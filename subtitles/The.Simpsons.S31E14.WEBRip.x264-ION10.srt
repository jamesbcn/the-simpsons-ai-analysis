1
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:27,294
Now that I, Chinnos,
finally wield the Doomsday App,

2
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,764
I can restart this planet
in flames,

3
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:32,099
as a utopia.

4
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,334
I don't know, Chinnos.
You say utopia,

5
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,169
but what I'm hearing is
kill everyone.

6
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,972
And I really don't want to find
a new dry cleaner.

7
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,941
Your funny-but-not-too-funny
banter

8
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:43,944
will not save you,
Magnesium Man.

9
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:46,914
Yeah, but it did distract you,
didn't it, Dad Bod?

10
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,148
Take him, Airshot!

11
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,854
Yes, Airshot, pump that air gun!

12
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:57,057
Five pumps?
Think of the pressure.

13
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,997
Aw, what's the matter?
Bad head day?

14
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:10,237
It's time I took the Vindicators
out of the equation.

15
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:18,045
I'll take that dance now.

16
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:26,153
Their first kiss was their last.

17
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:47,374
It was called Crystal War

18
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,576
because they were all
turned to crystals.

19
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:53,146
Hey, now is not the time
for your cold-hearted analysis.

20
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,849
The sequel isn't coming out
for a year.

21
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,885
What loving God would make us
wait that long?

22
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,121
A year?
That's, like, a million years.

23
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:04,291
I cannot wait.
Don't you leave me,

24
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:06,293
you be-cape-ed gob-smashers!

25
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,503
Children, I pulled you
out of your classes today

26
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,072
to warn you of a dangerous
new internet trend.

27
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,008
The paprika challenge?

28
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,076
The eight ball challenge?

29
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,979
No, the highly-imitatable stunt
I'm referring to

30
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,248
is the flag yourself
challenge.

31
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,953
Instead of a merely
verbal warning,

32
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,055
it's clear to me
a more effective deterrent

33
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:36,957
would be to show you
a video of the stunt

34
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:40,861
performed by YouTube star
Reaction Guy.

35
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,729
Reaction Guy?

36
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:45,766
Everybody who's anybody
gets reacted to by him.

37
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,135
Watch and learn...
to not do this.

38
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:51,738
What up, Reaction Faction?
It's your boy, Reaction Guy.

39
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,641
Today I'm gonna be reacting
to the Flag Yourself Challenge.

40
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:58,311
Shout-out to my crew, Hedgehog,
Thin Mint, and White Malik.

41
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,080
They're gonna raise me
like a flag.

42
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:08,689
Whoa, this is so clench!

43
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:09,956
Wow, cool!

44
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,097
Hey, guys, this is Bart Simpson

45
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:19,199
from my new channel,
Reaction Bart.

46
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,568
Big shout-out to my boy White
Seymour for putting me onto

47
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,304
the Flag Yourself Challenge.
So clench!

48
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,907
Okay, hit it. Check it out.

49
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,910
I'm waving at my haters
and they don't even know it.

50
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,546
Clench! Clench!

51
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,081
Buy my merch.

52
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,616
Merch to come. Merch!

53
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:44,691
His obliques
must be shredded.

54
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:47,327
I got to check them out
next time we go swimming.

55
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,535
Milhouse, no!

56
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,205
I need your passcode
to upload the video.

57
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,610
Yo, Milhouse, I got you
a balloon form the gift shop.

58
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,814
So what'd the doctors say?

59
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:10,317
I have a full-body sprain.

60
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,820
Most of my muscles are wrapped
around the wrong bones.

61
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,022
Okay, champ,
physical therapy time.

62
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,158
Who's ready for four hours
of stretch bands?

63
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,494
No, not the purple.

64
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,701
Glucose?

65
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,936
Don't mind if I do-cose.

66
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,174
Okay, mate, you can do this.

67
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:37,177
It's hard, but those little
buggers are counting on you.

68
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:40,113
Do it for the buggers.

69
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,026
Top of the bing-bong, ladies.

70
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,929
- You're Glen Tangier.
- You're Airshot.

71
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,898
Good on you, Nightingales.

72
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,167
Now, who can point me
towards...

73
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,969
Milhouse Van Houten?

74
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,439
Ooh, right down the hall
and to the left, Glen.

75
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,677
Flirt much, Debby?

76
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,846
Sorry, we can't all
be married to

77
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:16,550
Ogdenville's car detailing king
Duke Druthers.

78
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,919
What's up, little bro?

79
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,822
How's my favorite
real-life superhero?

80
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,257
Holy crap, you're Glen Tangier.

81
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,560
Never heard of him.

82
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,162
The name's Airshot.

83
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,266
You're my favorite Vindicator.

84
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,903
You don't even have any powers,
you're just super good at air.

85
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,873
Easy now. Don't get
too excited, Milhouse.

86
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,875
Oh, I'm not...

87
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,677
I am Milhouse.

88
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,948
That's right.
Calm down, hero.

89
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,617
Don't make whatever
you have worse.

90
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,954
Is it something that gets worse?
Please don't say it gets worse.

91
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,922
Oh, don't worry, Airshot,
I'm okay.

92
00:05:55,989 --> 00:06:00,060
Well, aren't you just Pimm
to the brim with Adelaide spunk?

93
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,730
Oh, thank boomerang Jesus

94
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,332
you're not one of those
brave little buggers

95
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,000
that I have to show this to.

96
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,002
Wait, what do you got in there?

97
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,938
Oh, it's a laptop
with the sequel

98
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:15,842
to the Vindicators,
Crystal garbage.

99
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:20,513
All that matters is
you're gonna be okay, mate.

100
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,184
Never wanted
to be an actor anyway,

101
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:27,954
just a simple koala butcher
like me old man.

102
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,163
Yo, Airshot. Glen.

103
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,469
Hello.

104
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,909
Sweet boomerang Jeebus.

105
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,184
What an ending.

106
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,454
People are gonna freak out
when they see it...

107
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,223
in a month from now.

108
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,594
Till then, I'm the only one
that knows what happens.

109
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:10,130
Only I know.

110
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:14,267
I'm the most powerful kid
in the world.

111
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,073
Toss that Kanga shank
into the billy-boil.

112
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,009
It'll be tender by moon jump.

113
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:32,519
Yo, Fat Thor, I've seen
Vindicators, Crystal War 2.

114
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,322
- You blaspheme!
- My buddy Airshot showed it to me.

115
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,290
Ha. I repeat, ha.

116
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:40,293
As if Glen Tangier,
the Tasmanian Adonis,

117
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,198
would deign to interact with
someone of your insignificance.

118
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:52,973
You are defeated, Vindicator.

119
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,576
Not as long as
I'm still breathing.

120
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:03,183
Sweet batarang Jesus.
Tell me more.

121
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,485
The first taste was free,

122
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,821
the next is gonna cost you.

123
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:12,058
I've had my eye on that
Dr. 3 A.M. graphic novel.

124
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,496
Okay, strap yourself in.
The way it goes down is...

125
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,732
But pause.
The knowledge you offer

126
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:22,569
would spoil the movie event
of the year. Nay, century.

127
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:25,205
Nay, epoch. Nay, summer.

128
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,740
Tell me nothing.

129
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,476
Ah, but my curiosity consumes me.

130
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,545
All right, here's the deal,
the movie starts on the logo...

131
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,547
Silence! Speak!

132
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,817
Speak not. Expound!

133
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,788
I pass the test.
I will diminish

134
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,190
and remain Comic Book Guy.

135
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,194
Ooh, shrimp.

136
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:52,932
Hey. What would you give me
not to find out what happens?

137
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,970
Be gone, Spoiler Boy.

138
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,039
Spoiler Boy.

139
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,840
I like that.

140
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,146
That's the kid who saw

141
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,015
Vindicators, Crystal War 2,
Resurgence.

142
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,918
Do what he says
or he'll spoil the ending.

143
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,854
I must protect my virgin ears.

144
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,530
I think you can do better
than that.

145
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,799
Four chicken lumpettes
per person.

146
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,034
Even if that person knows
which Vindicator

147
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:31,971
loses a third of their powers
fighting Karate Scorpion?

148
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,541
Zip it. My boyfriend's taking me
to see that movie

149
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,609
when it gets to
the two-dollar theater.

150
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,984
Simpson, you're getting
one day of detention

151
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:48,988
for every extra
lumpette you eat.

152
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,026
Detention, is it?

153
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,595
I guess we'll have
plenty of time to discuss

154
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,965
the fate of your favorite
Vindicator, Black Voodoo.

155
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,000
The champion
of the French Quarter.

156
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,802
You wouldn't dare spoil
the only thing

157
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,471
that brings me joy
in this world.

158
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:05,772
Give me your toupee.

159
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,874
Toupee?

160
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,110
I don't wear a toupee.

161
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,212
We fade in on Bourbon Street...

162
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,421
Principal Skinner. To what
do we owe the honor, sir, at...

163
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,189
Oh, it's just you.

164
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,859
Hey, how'd you get
all this stuff?

165
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,560
'Cause people do whatever I say

166
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,662
or I spoil the Vindicators movie
for them.

167
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,097
Like so...

168
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,733
Tell Mom it's okay for me
to have soda on my cereal.

169
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,102
I don't know.
Mom's not gonna go for that.

170
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:39,105
Okay. Get ready to hear
the surprise ending.

171
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:41,407
Let me guess.
The good guys win.

172
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,176
Who told you?

173
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,512
You can't spoil
that movie for me,

174
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,248
because I don't care
what happens.

175
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,116
You see, as a grown-up,

176
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:53,920
I know that muscle jerks
in tights with magic powers

177
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,824
punching and hugging each other
is boring BS for babies.

178
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,760
So go ahead,
tell me what Captain Doodad does

179
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,061
to Zippity Whoever.

180
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,030
Because it means nothing.

181
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:08,034
My powers don't work on you.

182
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:11,404
But what if I could make them
work for you?

183
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:15,408
Your sinister tone
intrigues me.

184
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:18,511
All-you-can-drink beers on me!

185
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:19,879
Yeah!

186
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,581
But paid for by Moe.

187
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:25,285
All right, I'm not even gonna
dignify that with a whaaa...

188
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,821
Do the thing, boy.

189
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,323
No, no, don't ruin it, kid!

190
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,125
I'm taking my girlfriend
to that movie

191
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,060
when it gets
to the two-dollar theater.

192
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,970
What time did you get home
last night?

193
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,272
It's not my fault.

194
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,907
Bart used his superpower

195
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,944
to get me drunker
than I've ever beer.

196
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,580
I'm worried that
all this blackmail

197
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,682
is turning Bart
into a bad person.

198
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,056
What's the story,
morning glories?

199
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:06,759
Young man, I don't like the way
you're using those spoilies

200
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,628
to boss people around.

201
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,097
What?

202
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:12,298
I was given an amazing power,

203
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,900
so I'm using it.

204
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,970
If you were in my suitcase,
you would do the same thing.

205
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:21,641
Fans have a deep connection to
the Marble Cinematic Universe.

206
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:25,178
I would never exploit that,
not for anything.

207
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,281
Oh, wouldn't you?

208
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:38,024
Lisa Simpson,
I think your superpower

209
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,659
must be stealing hearts.

210
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,064
How do you feel
about exploitation now?

211
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,534
It's okay.

212
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,237
How much
longer do I have to keep up

213
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,006
this kookaburra charade?

214
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,675
How badly do you not want
your bosses at Marble Studios

215
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:59,212
to know that I used your drunken
thumb to see that movie?

216
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,851
You think I'm your jolly
swagman, do you?

217
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,819
Well, my jumbuck's gonna be free

218
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,788
from your tucker bag
next Thursday,

219
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:12,358
when that movie goes wide
on every screen in creation.

220
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:15,862
And after that, you're nothing.

221
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,865
Let's get this party finished!

222
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,169
He's right.

223
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,570
I'm running out of time.

224
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,973
This is... endgame!

225
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,476
And so, today, we celebrate
the 200th birthday

226
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,379
of our beloved oak tree,
Old Susie.

227
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,683
Her stately branches
have shaded our town's weddings,

228
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:41,254
family reunions,
and quincen... quincien...

229
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,023
Mexican bar mitzvahs.

230
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,425
We're...

231
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,696
Cover you ears!
It's Spoiler Boy!

232
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,030
That's right. It's me.

233
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:53,199
And if you don't want
the movie spoiled,

234
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,301
you'll all pull together
and build me

235
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:58,404
the ultimate tree house
of my own design.

236
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,840
Right here in Old Susie.

237
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,243
Not in Old Susie!

238
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,679
Everyone in this town
loves that tree!

239
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,881
We have no choice.

240
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:12,051
He's got us all
by the short and curlies.

241
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:17,090
Unless the boy should meet
with an unfortunate accident.

242
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,693
And if anything suspicious
should happen to me,

243
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,963
I've hired the loudest man
in town to yell the ending

244
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,232
on every street corner.

245
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,067
I'm on it!

246
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:30,803
You have 24 hours
to build my tree house.

247
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,372
The clock is ticking.

248
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:39,645
Hey, buddy.

249
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,880
You're out of the hospital.

250
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:42,949
Don't you hey, buddy me.

251
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,084
You stole my visit
from Airshot.

252
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,120
You... You villain!

253
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,922
Me, a villain?
No way.

254
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,758
You just blackmailed
the whole town

255
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,092
to build you a lair.

256
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,361
Okay. I will grant you
the optics on the lair

257
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,929
are less than ideal.

258
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,599
You have actual powers
which you use for evil.

259
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,068
You're a supervillain!

260
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:05,071
You dare call me a supervillain?

261
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,539
Then get a load of this.

262
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:09,776
The biggest spoiler
in the whole movie!

263
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,911
Magnesium Man!

264
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:12,945
Don't say another word!

265
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,548
The fate of our universe
depends on it.

266
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,326
Where the hell am I?

267
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,162
Relax there, Spoiler Boy.

268
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,597
All we did was take you
from your dimension into ours.

269
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,666
You know, the Marble universe?

270
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:37,103
What you consider to be movies
make up our reality.

271
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,006
No way. Superheroes aren't real.

272
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,008
How dumb do you think I am?

273
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:45,144
Actual superpowers!

274
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,346
Everything you see
in your Vindicator movies

275
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,948
actually happens to us.

276
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,851
Even the post-credit sequences?

277
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,886
We brought you here

278
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,323
to see the result
of your selfish actions.

279
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,927
Airshot! Dead?

280
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,428
But in the movie he lives.

281
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,130
What happened?

282
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,465
You happened!

283
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,467
You son of a swamp witch!

284
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:11,804
You showed your Comic Book Guy
a spoiler

285
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:15,041
of Airshot using his breath
to save himself.

286
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,043
The powers of evil
in our dimension

287
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:21,280
saw this and, so warned,
taped Airshot's mouth shut.

288
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,482
And killed him.

289
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,051
I didn't know!

290
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,553
I never dreamed that spoilers
really hurt people.

291
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,691
But they do.
Spoilers kill!

292
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,894
I love you, Airshot!

293
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,929
The virtual reality's working.

294
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,199
The kid has no idea
that this has all been fake.

295
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,068
I can't believe he didn't notice

296
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,036
that the dimensional portal
in his backyard

297
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:47,373
was just a garbage bag
full of glow sticks.

298
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,242
Tell me we're doing
the right thing.

299
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,277
Tell me this is
Bart's best chance

300
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,112
to choose to be a good person.

301
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,881
Don't worry, Marge.

302
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,884
No one's ever been hurt
by a little gaslighting.

303
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,219
Remember how
you always say that?

304
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,021
Remember?

305
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,991
Oh, don't think of it
as gaslighting.

306
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,993
Think of it as
an ultra-enhanced,

307
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,728
immersive fan experience.

308
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:12,098
All this, just to keep
spoilers from leaking.

309
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:15,334
Vindicators, colon,
Crystal War, colon, Resurgence

310
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,769
bombing at the box office

311
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,905
would have devastating
consequences.

312
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,041
Failing theme parks,
unsold Halloween costumes

313
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:23,175
rotting on the docks,

314
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,545
mass suicides
by popcorn farmers,

315
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,681
anything worse than a 55% hold

316
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,182
on its second weekend,

317
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,419
the global economy
collapses like a house of cards.

318
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,922
Is that what you want,
little girl? Is it?

319
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,456
No. No.

320
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,392
Bart clearly feels bad.

321
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,160
Can't we let him out now?

322
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,996
No. We have to be
absolutely sure.

323
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,799
Increasing simulation intensity.

324
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,672
Bring me the boy.

325
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,079
Remember, kid, no spoilers!

326
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,681
Our universe depends on it!

327
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,585
And don't pirate movies.
That hurts everyone.

328
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,923
So, the boy who's seen
how all this ends.

329
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,425
Tell me what you know,

330
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,994
so I can use it
to destroy the Vindicators.

331
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:18,164
In return, I will grant
your deepest desire.

332
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,933
Actual superpowers.

333
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,902
Muscles...

334
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,303
claws...

335
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,738
bike!

336
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,073
Real powers.

337
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,842
That's even better
than spoiler powers.

338
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:34,413
Oh, no. Our son is going
to choose evil.

339
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,951
Oh, no! Our son is so stupid
he's going to fall for this!

340
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,053
It doesn't matter
that's it not real.

341
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,389
Bart's soul is at stake.

342
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:47,793
Great emotion.
Talk about upping the ante.

343
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,695
Tell me the spoilers, child.

344
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:52,398
And embrace your destiny
as a villain.

345
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,067
Airshot.

346
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,869
All right.

347
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,471
I'll tell you
what you have to do to win.

348
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,672
- No!
- Uh-uh, kid.

349
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,874
Eat my shorts.

350
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,146
No. No.

351
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,215
No...!

352
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:19,725
Our son's a good guy!
A good guy.

353
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:23,729
But he's still stupid.
So stupid...

354
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,898
The kid turned down
actual superpowers.

355
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:28,234
I think he'll
keep his mouth shut.

356
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,136
Okay. We'll let him live.

357
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,704
For now.

358
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,510
I'm back.

359
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,079
I just hope it's not too late.

360
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,681
What day is it?

361
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:45,051
Why, it's the Wednesday
before Memorial Day, it is.

362
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,085
Then there's still time.

363
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:47,887
The movie hasn't been spoiled.

364
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:48,954
Don't worry, son.

365
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,357
Your secret I forgot
is safe with me.

366
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:54,694
I saved their universe.
I'm not a villain.

367
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,563
I'm a superhero.

368
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,766
- When can we tell him?
- Never.

369
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,268
All right.
No one's gonna talk.

370
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,269
The movie's safe.

371
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,739
We'll let them live.
For now.

372
00:20:23,137 --> 00:20:25,491
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm a good guy.

373
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,961
I'll never spoil anything again.

374
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,697
I'm a changed boy.
A changed boy.

375
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,133
I always knew you had
the stuff of heroes.

376
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,302
Just tell me, does Moby Man
take his place

377
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,705
as the rightful sovereign
of Fishtonia?

378
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:42,141
Does he? Bart!
Tell me!

379
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,976
Stop your labors, good folk.

380
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:48,047
Magnesium Man bless us,
every one.

381
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:51,117
And Bart was as good
as his word.

382
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,119
He kept his mouth shut.

383
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,222
So when everyone finally
saw the movie on opening day,

384
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,557
they were filled with joy.

385
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,860
Then immediately
got on their phones

386
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,029
and spoiled it
for everyone else.
