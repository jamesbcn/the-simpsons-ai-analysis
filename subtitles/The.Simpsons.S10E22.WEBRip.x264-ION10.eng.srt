a lot of copies of the paper.

00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,366
Lindsey Naegle, Advanced Capital Ventures.

174
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,834
Oh. What do you produce?

175
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,214
Synergy... and books
on how to cheat at Bridge.

176
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,291
Lisa, I think you'll really enjoy it here.

177
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,127
Now, let's get down to business.

178
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,712
Any new palindromes?

179
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,677
(clears throat) Rise to vote, sir.

180
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:11,718
Now, you know the agenda.

181
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,721
Palindromes, anagrams,
eat Lisa's pie, then voting.

182
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,354
{\an8}But "rise to vote, sir" is a palindrome.

183
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,021
(murmuring)

184
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,480
Lisa, I think you're gonna fit in

185
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,060
just fine around here.

186
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,725
Wow... me... fit in.

187
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,115
(disguising voice) Hello.

188
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,700
I have a certificate
for a free erotic photo session.

189
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:40,957
Oh, yes. Your name?

190
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,038
Uh...

191
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,293
Geraldo... Simpson.

192
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,495
-All right, Mr. Simpson.
-(exclaims) Who told you?

193
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,086
Don't worry. These photos
are perfectly legal.

194
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,971
Many husbands use 'em as a romantic gift
for their wives.

195
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,429
{\an8}Uh... you're not gonna ask me
to pose nude, are you?

196
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,811
Well, yes, unless you have some issues
with revealing your body.

197
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,979
Well, I don't, but the block association
seems to.

198
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:05,189
They wanted a "traditional" Santa Claus.

199
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,857
I can't believe how they're dumbing down
the Springfield library.

200
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,242
They've gotten rid of
the English literature section

201
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,320
and replaced it with
a "make your own sundae" bar.

202
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,326
I heard they got rid of the reference desk

203
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,448
-to make room for an air hockey table.
-Even the microfilm?

204
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,616
{\an8}-Even the microfiche.
-(all groaning)

205
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,376
My family never talks
about library standards,

206
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,379
and every time I try to
steer the conversation that way,

207
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,962
they make me feel like a nerd.

208
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,837
We are hardly nerds. Would a nerd wear
such an irreverent sweatshirt?

209
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,465
{\an8}(Lisa reading)

210
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,350
(laughing)

211
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,390
Oh, only one person in a million
would find that funny.

212
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,645
{\an8}Yes, we call that the Dennis Miller ratio.

213
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:49,108
(Lisa humming)

214
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,780
Oh, Dad, I just spent the day
with the most wonderful people.

215
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,400
Oh, that's great, honey.

216
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,107
You tell me everything you can
before the commercial's over.

217
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,778
Well, for the first time in my life,

218
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,116
I feel that someone understands.

219
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,201
Up-bup-bup-bup!

220
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,961
Are you ready in there, Mr. Simpson?

221
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:05,959
HOMER: Are you sure

222
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,330
you're a fully accredited
and bonded pornographer?

223
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,337
Just come out.

224
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,884
Please be kind.

225
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,130
You look fantastic. Let me just adjust
my lens here.

226
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,431
Now you're sure
this will save my marriage?

227
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,854
Try not to speak;
it's making your body ripple.

228
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,443
-(groans)
-Ugh!

229
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,020
Ooh!

230
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,855
-BART: Dad? Dad, are you home?
-(exclaims)

231
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,320
(gasps)

232
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,440
Ow!

233
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,566
(grunting)

234
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,073
Fine. I don't care what you're doing.

235
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,235
Oh.

236
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,373
(screams)

237
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,619
Don't look. Don't look. Don't look.

238
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,960
OK, I think he's gone.

239
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,329
Let's reschedule.

240
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,707
This is so cool.

241
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,665
I feel like I'm back in the renaissance.

242
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,665
Please stay in character, gentle wench.

243
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,637
Verily I declare that the Earth
revolves around the Sun

244
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,929
and not t'other way round.

245
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,012
Stop looking down my blouse, Copernicus.

246
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,228
Forsooth, mine eyes doth
rove of their own accord.

247
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,439
-Zounds!
-(indistinct burping)

248
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,099
Someone took our gazebo.

249
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,232
{\an8}No, no, that's impossible.
We reserved it months ago.

250
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,066
Someone should stand up to them.

251
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,952
-Whoa!
-Mm...

252
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,358
Oh, I'll do it.

253
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,324
Excuse me, gentlemen.

254
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,237
Might I take a peek
at your gazebo reservation form?

255
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,826
-Beat it.
-(chuckles)

256
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,001
Yes, well, we each have a good case.

257
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,920
What part of "beat it"
didn't you understand?

258
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,749
Mm. I guess it would be the "it."

259
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,335
I'm not exactly sure to what that refers.

260
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,341
It's a-- Ow!

261
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,762
Oh, it's hopeless.

262
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,760
There's some she-males in gazebo three,

263
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,223
a nasty-looking spider in gazebo six,

264
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,104
and the less said about
gazebo eight, the better.

265
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,642
Ah, Chief, thank God you're here.

266
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,685
We reserved gazebo seven and look.

267
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,020
Geez, how many gazebos
do you she-males need?

268
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,477
Beer me, boys.

269
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,320
Why do we live in a town

270
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,033
where the smartest have no power,

271
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,493
and the stupidest run everything?

272
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,243
Maybe I should just move back to Alabama.

273
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,285
No, we should fix things here.
If we put our minds to it

274
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,289
there's no limit
to what we can accomplish.

275
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,921
I think the girl's right.

276
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,716
-The jig is up, Quimby.
-Oh, God.

277
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,679
When you see what's in this report,

278
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,969
things are going to change in this town.

279
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,393
I earned that lotto money.

280
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,641
I swear.

281
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,984
-Hyah!
-(horse neighs)

282
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,113
Faster, you moron.

283
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,493
Huh. Well, that was unexpected.

284
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,083
What's going on? Where's the mayor?

285
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,289
He skipped town.

286
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,329
Really?

287
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,791
So, who's in charge?

288
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,372
Well, that's a good question.

289
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,207
Let's, uh, take a quick look
at the town charter.

290
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,046
ALL: Done.

291
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,971
-Finished.
-According to the charter,

292
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,680
should the mayor abdicate,

293
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,430
the Council of Learned Citizens
may rule in his stead.

294
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,563
{\an8}Well, there's no one more learned than us.

295
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,850
So, I guess...
(chuckling) we're in charge.

296
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,645
What? Let me see that. Let me see here.

297
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,900
"We the people, cruel and unusual,"
blah, blah, blah...

298
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,034
"ritual circumcision," yak, yak, yak...

299
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,111
Ah, geez, I'll take your word for it.

300
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,906
I guess you are in charge.

301
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,160
(cheering)

302
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,951
With our superior intellects

303
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,954
we could rebuild this city on a foundation

304
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,576
of reason and enlightenment.

305
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,833
We could turn Springfield into a utopia.

306
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,205
A new Athens.

307
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,542
Or Walden Two.

308
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,916
Yeah, a real candyland.

309
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,421
Of the mind... the mind.

310
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,426
I'll just go now.

311
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,628
Bunch of dorks.

312
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,509
This is Kent Brockman at City Hall

313
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,558
where the intellectual junta
known as the "bright pack"

314
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,642
has been running this town for
the better part of three days.

315
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,403
(chattering indistinctly)

316
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,772
So, Lisa, what do you
and your fellow eggheads

317
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,188
have planned for the city?
Business as usual?

318
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,107
No, Kent, we're going to use
the power of good ideas

319
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,485
to change things for the better.

320
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,162
(laughs) Well, excuse this jaded reporter

321
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,701
if he says he's heard that before.

322
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,204
-Oh, well, we really mean it.
-(gasps) You do?

323
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,367
Yes. For example, no one
was showing up for jury duty,

324
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,287
so we made the experience more exciting

325
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,915
by synergizing it
with his comic book collection.

326
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,423
"You have been chosen
to join the justice squadron

327
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,967
8:00 am. Monday

328
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,641
at the Municipal Fortress of Vengeance."

329
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,350
Oh, I am so there.

330
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,310
{\an8}We studied traffic patterns and found

331
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,350
{\an8}that drivers move the fastest
through yellow lights.

332
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:40,685
{\an8}So now, we just have
the red and yellow lights.

333
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,943
(goofy laugh)

334
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,947
Come on! Stay yellow, stay yellow!

335
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,698
Man, I'm making record time.

336
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,743
If only I had someplace to be.

337
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,366
And we've really elevated

338
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,503
the level of discourse at the dog track.

339
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,751
<i>We replaced the fanfare</i>
<i>with classical music,</i>

340
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,543
<i>and instead of chasing a rabbit</i>
<i>the dogs chase a diploma.</i>

341
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:03,748
(dogs barking)

342
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,093
The world has already taken note
of our accomplishments.

343
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,894
Springfield has moved up to number 299

344
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,099
on the list of America's
300 most livable cities.

345
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,180
Take that, East St. Louis.

346
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,403
Gee, you said you were gonna
make me look sexier,

347
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,939
but it's awfully dark in here.

348
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,782
Light is not your friend.

349
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:28,278
-All right, let's do this thing.
-It's time to get Homer-erotic.

350
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,782
-(upbeat music playing)
-(exclaims)

351
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,544
OK, next item of business
is our weekly progress report.

352
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,082
Principal Skinner,
how's your transportation project coming?

353
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:41,996
Oh, excellent.

354
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,254
Not only are the trains
now running on time

355
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,046
they're running on metric time.

356
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,880
Remember this moment, people...
80 past 2:00 on April 47.

357
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,507
It's the dawn
of an enlightened Springfield.

358
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:56,024
Excellent. Now, next week is
our State of the City address.

359
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,018
Has everyone finalized their proposals?

360
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,560
Well, first of all I have a plan

361
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,563
to eliminate obesity in females.

362
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,105
Oh, please. For
a nickel-a-person tax increase,

363
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,069
we could build a theater
for shadow puppets.

364
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,650
Balinese or Thai?

365
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,695
Why not both? Then everybody's happy.

366
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,858
Oh, yeah, everyone's <i>real </i>happy then.

367
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,027
Do I detect a note of sarcasm?

368
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,236
{\an8}Are you kidding me?

369
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,575
{\an8}This baby is off the charts.

370
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,041
Ooh, a sarcasm detector...

371
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,871
Oh, that's a real useful invention.

372
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,287
(overlapping conversation)

373
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,586
HOMER (in playful voice):
Marge, oh, Marge.

374
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,381
I've got something for you.

375
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,836
{\an8}Oh, Homie.

376
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,715
HOMER: Houston, we have a problem...

377
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,852
a sexy problem.

378
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:39,139
Homie, well, look at you.

379
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,194
Grrr. And I'm gonna maul you.

380
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,559
Home, I've never seen this side of you,

381
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,266
but I like it.

382
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,324
Whoo, whoo! Look at those silk pillows.

383
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,865
It's like the set
of some high-class porno film.

384
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,789
(giggles) No, no, it's just our basement.

385
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,539
Mm, hold on.

386
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,171
What, that's our basement?

387
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,578
Yes, so come on, more kissing.

388
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,877
It looks so elegant, and all it takes

389
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,511
are some lace curtains
and a beaded lampshade.

390
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,719
You've got to show me
exactly what you did.

391
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,130
But I was going to score.

392
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,338
No, you weren't.

393
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,466
Welcome, everyone.

394
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,265
Today we embark on a new era

395
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,139
of intelligent governance.

396
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,806
ALL: Governance! Governance! Governance!

397
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,476
(clearing throat) We have some new rules
and regulations

398
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,646
that you're just gonna go ape-poopy over.

399
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,645
Professor Frank?

400
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,356
Hi. Well, first of all,

401
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,446
we're going to ban such barbaric sports

402
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,162
as bullfighting and cockfighting.

403
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,202
(all cheering)

404
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,445
Also boxing, uh, both kick

405
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,868
-and the kind with the gloves, there.
-(mild cheer)

406
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,957
And hockey, football, push-ups,

407
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,552
and anything in general
where you have to take off your shirt,

408
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,548
{\an8}-which is embarrassing.
-(all protesting)

409
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,260
I don't remember discussing that.

410
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:58,764
Inspired by the most
logical race in the galaxy, the Vulcans,

411
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,256
breeding will be permitted
once every seven years.

412
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,217
(crowd exclaiming)

413
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,806
{\an8}For many of you this will mean
much less breeding.

414
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,692
For me, much, much more.

415
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:09,149
You cannot do that, sir!
You don't have the power!

416
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,531
Uh-huh, ladies and gentlemen,
I must apologize.

417
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,858
This man does not speak
for the Council of Alphas.

418
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,704
We hold you sub-omeguloids
in the highest regard.

419
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,700
When are we going to get
to my broccoli juice program?

420
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,832
Quit butting in, please.

421
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,698
Your IQ is a mere 155,

422
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,495
while mine is a muscular 170.

423
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,999
<i>♪ I am smart ♪</i>

424
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,790
<i>♪ Much smarter than you, Hibbert ♪</i>

425
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,245
You should all do what I say.

426
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,924
My IQ is 199 for crying out flaven...

427
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,671
198, 197...

428
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,716
MALE AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Big deal.</i>

429
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,929
<i>My IQ is 280.</i>

430
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,260
(all gasp)

431
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,259
ALL: Stephen Hawking!

432
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,967
The world's smartest man.

433
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,137
What are you doing here?

434
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,765
<i>I wanted to see your utopia,</i>

435
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,363
<i>but now I see, it is more of a fruitopia.</i>

436
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,899
(chuckles) I'm sure
what Dr. Hawking means is...

437
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,193
DR. HAWKING: <i>Silence.</i>

438
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:58,276
<i>I don't need anyone to talk</i>
<i>for me except this voice box.</i>

439
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,623
<i>You have clearly been corrupted by power.</i>

440
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,619
<i>For shame.</i>

441
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,040
Larry Flint is right.

442
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,118
You guys stink.

443
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,833
(all agreeing)

444
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,714
<i>I don't know which</i>
<i>is a bigger disappointment...</i>

445
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:13,631
<i>my failure to formulate</i>
<i>a unified field theory, or you.</i>

446
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,132
I don't like your tone.

447
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,184
<i>If you are looking for trouble,</i>
<i>you found it.</i>

448
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,338
Yeah, just try me, you--

449
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,296
Ow!

450
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,925
(cheering)

451
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,012
Now's our opening. Come on, you idiots,

452
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,677
we're taking back this town.

453
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,266
Yeah, let's make litter
out of these literati.

454
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,772
That's too clever. You're one of them.

455
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:31,864
(all screaming)

456
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,651
Please, stay calm, everyone.

457
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,740
(screams)

458
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,699
<i>Time for this hawk to fly.</i>

459
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,582
<i>Wrong button.</i>

460
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,879
LISA: Help!

461
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,257
Lisa, thank God you're OK.

462
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,886
Did you have fun with your robot buddy?

463
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,433
Dad... Oh, Dr. Hawking,

464
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,977
{\an8}we had such a beautiful dream.
What went wrong?

465
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,772
DR. HAWKING: <i>Don't feel bad, Lisa.</i>

466
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,645
<i>Sometimes the smartest of us</i>

467
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,482
<i>can be the most childish.</i>

468
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:21,147
-Even you?
<i>-No, not me. Never.</i>

469
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,068
I guess everyone has a different vision

470
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,526
for the perfect world.

471
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,576
{\an8}Wow, Mom, that's very profound.

472
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,790
{\an8}<i>Hey, you read that off my screen.</i>

473
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,538
-Who's up for some beers?
-I am.

474
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,213
<i>That's the smartest thing</i>
<i>I've heard all day.</i>

475
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,514
<i>Your theory of a doughnut-shaped universe</i>

476
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,218
<i>is intriguing, Homer.</i>

477
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,879
<i>I may have to steal it.</i>

478
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,047
Wow. I can't believe
someone I never heard of

479
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,887
is hanging out with a guy like me.

480
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,392
All right, it's closing time.

481
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,523
Who's paying the tab?

482
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,639
HOMER (mechanically): I am.

483
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,016
<i>I didn't say that.</i>

484
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,522
Yes, I did.

485
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,903
D'oh.
