{\an8}Mom's birthday is tomorrow.

14
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,748
{\an8}It's time to start your
annual mad dash around town

15
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:28,375
{\an8}to get her a present that's
not completely insulting.

16
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,013
{\an8}You know, sweetie,
there was a time when I would've killed

17
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,891
{\an8}for that information,
but I'm pleased to announce

18
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,548
{\an8}I've already bought
your mother a present.

23
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,151
{\an8}Wha...?
Mom is gonna love that!

24
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,244
{\an8}(chuckles) Love?!

25
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,899
{\an8}Your mom's gonna
feel so good,

26
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:56,567
{\an8}it'll make mere love
seem like chewing tinfoil.

27
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,828
{\an8}Because today,
I'm getting it autographed.

28
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,251
{\an8}By who? Lenny?

29
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,079

{\an8}Man, oh, man,
look at this place.

00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,476
{\an8}Finally, a supermarket
with a clear premise:

34
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,101
{\an8}"island something."

35
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,727
{\an8}It's like going to Hawaii
without the murderous locals.

36
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,355
{\an8}They have jellies made of fruits
I've never heard of!

37
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,322
{\an8}These'll go great with
betel nut butter.

38
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,364
{\an8}Wow, I don't believe
the Simpsons

39
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,027
{\an8}will be shopping at the
Kwik-E-Mart anymore.

40
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,826
{\an8}Oh, really?

41
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,499
{\an8}Apu! What are you doing
out of your natural habitat?

42
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,579
{\an8}I am finding out who my
real customers are,

43
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,924
{\an8}and who is going to cheat
on my store with some

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,170
{\an8}South Sea sugar shack!

45
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,001
{\an8}But at the Kwik-E-Mart,
the only fresh fruit

46
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,256
{\an8}is the one banana
by the register.

47
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:56,178
{\an8}You keep your ice cream
right beside the motor oil!

48
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,179
{\an8}You sell cigarettes to kids.

49
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,101
{\an8}Now see here,
I have always considered

50
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,100
{\an8}you cash-giving cows
to be my friends.

51
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,232
{\an8}And friends do not
betray friends.

52
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,019
{\an8}Friends are the only
people you can betray!

53
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,403
{\an8}And you'd do it in a second
for a supermarket

54
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,270
{\an8}that gives free coffee samples!

55
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,187
{\an8}Oh! Defend yourself, sir!

{\an8}Uh-huh.

61
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,320
{\an8}Would you sign this
for my wife Marge?

62
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,487
{\an8}She's a big fan
and her birthday is tomorrow.

63
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:08,117
{\an8}Uh-hm, you know, while I was
signing this for your wife,

64
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,576
{\an8}-I just cooked up...
-(gasps)

65
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,337
{\an8}-...a great idea!
-Oh...

66
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,378
{\an8}How would you like it
if I called your wife live

67
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,923
{\an8}from my show tomorrow
to wish her a happy birthday?

68
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,337
{\an8}You would do that?!

69
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,925
{\an8}Oh, my God,
this might be a Marge's birthday

70
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,432
{\an8}where I get sex!

71
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,228
{\an8}Ooh! An apron with a sonnet!

72
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,810
{\an8}Open mine!
Quick, before it suffocates!

73
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:34,355
{\an8}A bunny! Just like the one
I had when I was a girl!

74
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,900
{\an8}How did you know?

75
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,744
{\an8}I saw this picture
at Grandma's house,

76
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,409
{\an8}then I hit the pet stores
till I found one that looked just like it.

77
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,118
{\an8}Oh, Bart, you got me
the fluffy pet

78
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,329
{\an8}I've never stopped
thinking about.

79
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,710
{\an8}Now, last but not least,
your present, Homie.

80
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,921
{\an8}Oh! (chuckles)
Wait one second, Marge.

81
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,843
{\an8}Before you open it,
you're gonna get a phone call

82
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,592
{\an8}that will make this your
most awesome birthday ever.

83
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,465
Well, we're still focused on me

84
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,182
instead of watching golf,
so that's pretty good.

85
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,223
The only golf we'll watch is

86
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,137
ladies' golf,
and we're not watching that.

87
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:15,106
Now in three...
two... one...

88
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:18,569
I repeat. One...

89
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:25,124
Ooooooone...

90
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,289
(moaning)

91
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:33,079
(coughs) ...ne.

92
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,456
(raspy)
Oonnneee...

93
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,634
Please don't say "one" again.

94
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,173
(whispers weakly)
Onnneee.

95
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,297
Homie, whatever it is,
it's not happening.

96
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,255
(grunts)

97
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,306
This yolk-separating
camera-hog

98
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,809
was supposed to call you
and say happy birthday!

99
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,812
From her show!

100
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,654
Well, at least you
remembered I like her.

101
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,731
A pity kiss?!

102
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,396
That tears it!

103
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,105
I'm gonna call that Paula Paul

104
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,155
and give her a piece of my mind!

105
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,318
Huh? The phone's dead.

106
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:11,077
Normal, normal, normal,
normal, nor...

107
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,912
Uncharacteristic?!

108
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,247
Hm? A chew-through.
What could have...

109
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,208
Aw...

110
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,674
I mean-- (growls)

111
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,594
Aw, he's trying
to eat "ewectwicity."

112
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,844
You let this monster
into our home,

113
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,057
where he chewed through
our one and only phone cord!

114
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:32,098

left a message.

They're booing you, Marge!

133

I think that's
enough birthday fun.

Why you little...
I'm gonna get...

137
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,735
(grunts)
No, Homer.

138
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,577
You can't strangle a boy
on his mother's birthday.

139
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,753
Juries hate that.

140
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,751
So instead, boy,
I want you to...

141
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,424
(grunts)

142
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,963
Get in that rabbit cage!

143
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,546
No way, man.
I'm a free-range kid.

144
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,972
No back talk!
In the cage! Now!

145
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,601
Get in there.

146
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,146
(sucking)

147
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,520
Son, do you have a minute?

148
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,778
I've been thinking.

149
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,609
I really shouldn't have
put you in there

150
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,364
and left you there while we
were having pizza without you.

151
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,277
So I'm gonna let you out
with my apologies.

152
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,041
Don't wanna come out.

153
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,699
(high-pitched grumbling)
What!?

154
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:17,957
I like it in the cage.

155
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,249
These cedar shavings are
a hell of a lot better

156
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,383
than my lumpy mattress.

157
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,800
Boy, get out of that cage!

158
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,629
But it's my home now, sir.

159
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,974
(grunts)
I'll poke a broom in there!

160
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,380
You know I'm capable of it!

161
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,388
-(both grunting)
-Hey!

162
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,969
Get out of there,

163
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,354
-you little brat.
-(grunting)

164
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,975
Aah!

165
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,234
Fine.

166
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,106
(muttering)

167
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,703
Stupid kid.

168
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,909
Hmm.

169
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,569
{\an8}This isn't comfortable at all.

170
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,698
{\an8}I don't see how a rabbit
could possibly...

{\an8}(snores)

172
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,917
There. Finished.

173
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,381
Awesome revenge,
cutting your dad's

174
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,512
face out of a piece
of cardboard.

175
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,469
No, you dweeb.
It's a stencil.

176
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,970
I'm going to take
Homer's ugly face

177
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,391
and spread it all over town.

178
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,179
Can I come?
Every vandalism spree

179
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,274
needs an obnoxious laugher.

180
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,599
-(obnoxious laughing)
-You're in.

181
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,845
("The Sorcerer's Apprentice" playing)

182
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,054
Hey, you punks!
What are you doing?!

183
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,840
(both laughing)

184
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,133
If you wake up my pigeons,

185
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,376
they're gonna do
their business again.

186
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,967
And these days,
there's no newspapers

187
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,972
so I have to put down
Amazon Kindles.

188
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,144
I'm like...
It's, it's bankrupting me.

189
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:02,353

00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,935
HOMER:
Wait a minute...

192
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,697
that guy on the poster
looks familiar.

193
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:18,279
Don't just stare back at me,
come up with a theory!

194
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,867
Geez, it's all over the place.

195
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,213
Holy moley!

196
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,882
Quiet night.
Nothin' but the sound

197
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,050
of a spray can
and kids laughing, heh.

198
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,128
Tag, we're it!

199
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,046
Springfield has been hit hard by
a mysterious graffiti artist

200
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,676
and his iconic calling-card,

201
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,143
which we have dubbed
"Mr. Fatso."

202
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,813
Heard about this thing, boy?

203
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,192
No, no. I'm too concerned
with unemployment.

204
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,979
<i>HOMER: Hm, sounds like a lie,</i>
<i>but what could he be covering up?</i>

205
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:51,324
Homie, have you seen our
stencil budget for this month?

206
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,190
Not now, Marge.

207
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,527
Chief, any leads on this
"Vandal Van Gogh"?

208
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,534
I don't traffic in wordplay, Kent.

209
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,866
But I do have a message
for Mr. Prank Lloyd Wright.

210
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,372
Uh, that's architecture,
not painting, Chief.

211
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,825
They're all artists, Lou.
Why don't you open your eyes.

212
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,286
Now, as for Mr. Prank Gehry,

213
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,457
you may have thumbed
your nose at the police,

214
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,505
and made yourself into
a combination of Robin Hood,

215
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,640
<i>Luke Skywalker and, well,</i>
<i>every rapper ever,</i>

216
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,968
but unless you prove that this
wasn't just a one-time spree,

217
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:24,055
and take your controversial art form
to the next level,

218
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,311
I am not impressed.

219
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,193
Hmm...

220
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,109
{\an8}(screams)

221
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,938
{\an8}Boy, you like this
necklace I just bought?

222
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,863
{\an8}Pretty dope, don't you think?

223
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,532
{\an8}(sighs)

224
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,910
So, how do you like
working at Swapper Jack's?

225
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:41,528
Hey, after biting off a man's
nose in a prison race war,

226
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,077
selling pre-cooked
Pad Thai to soccer moms

227
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,331
is pretty darn sweet.

228
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,173
Here, I'm not Jailbird,
I'm just "Bird."

229
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,629
-(gun cocks)
-This is a stick-them-up!

230
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,339
Because I have a gun,
you must stick them up now!

231
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,259
Yes, it is loaded, with bullets
that you put in my chest.

232
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,298
Now empty the cash drawer!
Come on!

233
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,802
All right, chill, bro.
Just chill out.

234
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,354
I will chill you,
right between your damned eyes!

235
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,509
For once, the Indian
has been outsourced!

236
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,637
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.
Just give me the piece.

237
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,055
-No... No...
-You've got a family, dude.

238
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,604
Or were you lying when
you begged for your life?

239
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:14,648
Oh, sweet Vishnu the Destroyer,
what have I done?

240
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,784
Dude, it's okay. The jails,
they don't have room for us now.

241
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,032
Wiggum just makes you do
book reports for Ralph.

242
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,575
But you have to make 'em
so it looks like he's done it.

243
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,159
That's... that's
kinda the hard part.

244
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,084
Where's this 2006 Beaujolais

245
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,873
that's puttin' me out of business?

246
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,206
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
There's a white wine?

247
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,132
And wha-- and a Swiss cheese?
And a peanut butter?

248
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,131
And a potato chip?
And toilet paper?

249
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,553
Wha-what?!

250
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:43,011
Yo, mysterious pranksters,
it's time for dinner.

251
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,465
Damn it, she knows!

252
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,305
Okay, how do we
buy your silence?

253
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,890
Just throw in a couple of
"fur is murders."

254
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,306
How is fur murder?
They're just animals.

255
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,475
Dad!

256
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,233
Fine. Fur is murder.

257
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,145
Everything's murder.

Thanks, Milhouse.
We make a great team.

267

Hold it right there!

Here, drink this paint thinner.

274
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:47,326
So you're the two punks
who've been tagging the town.

275
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,989
Congratulations.

276
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,158
-BOTH: Huh?
-We're street artists.

277
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,248
Take that, Ronald Reagan!

278
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,133
Even in death,
you're not safe from me.

279
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:01,091
Is that graffiti or are you
opening up a Mommy and Me?

280
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:05,093
That's it. You just got yourself
a place on the wall, kid.

281
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,137
Nooo!
I've been satirized!

282
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,892
Who are you guys?

283
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,644
Kenny Scharf, Robbie Conal.

284
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,805
I'm Shepard Fairey.

285
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,653
(chuckles)
What was that name again?

286
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:16,769
Shepard Fairey.

287
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,186
NELSON (distant):
Haw-haw!

288
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,614
(laughing)

289
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,072
I'm the guy who created
the Obama "Hope" poster,

290
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,822
and the "Obey" stickers.

291
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,994
Man, you're the talkiest
bullies I ever met.

292
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,163
We're not bullies,
we're artists.

293
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,202
And so are you.

294
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,495
Urban vandalism is now
the hottest art form there is.

295
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,330
Hey, I got an F in art.

296
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,915
Mainly so it would say
"fart" on my report card.

297
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,421
(dog howls)

298
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,882
Bart, we would love
to set up a gallery show

299
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,843
for your street art.

300
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,262
Well, if it's in a gallery,
how is it street art?

301
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,511
Bart, street art is not about
questioning authority.

302
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,305
Well, I'll have to discuss it
with my partner.

303
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,179
Bart, say yes!

304
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,226
At the opening,
I could wear a sports jacket

305
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,020
with a T-shirt and jeans!

306
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,113
First, I'm not sure
you have the shoulders for it,

307
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,278
and second, maybe we've
pushed this far enough.

308
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,738
<i>(laughing)</i>

309
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,448
<i>I put you in a rabbit cage!</i>

310
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:10,409
<i>I poked your flab back in,</i>
<i>square by square.</i>

311
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,542
(growls)
Count me in.

312
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,371
(siren wailing)

313
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,996
(tires screeching)

314
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,542
Apu! It is a miracle!

315
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,497
What now?
Swapper Jack is reuniting

316
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,957
Led Zeppelin in aisle six?

317
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,627
Swapper Jack's is closing!

318
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,295
No. Do not give me
false hope,

319
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,303
like the time they said
it was only sextuplets.

320
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,925
It is true!
Every successful corporation

321
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,893
harbors a terrible secret.

322
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:36,313
Theirs is that what they sell
as chicken is actually monkey.

323
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,733
-But the drumsticks...
-Stunted monkey tails.

324
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,152
-And their chicken pot pie?
-Monkey pot pie!

325
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,401
But how 'bout their
rotisserie chi--

326
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,943
Monkey, monkey, monkey!

327
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,776
They scoop them up off
the streets of Brazil!

328
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,162
So, we have won.

329
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,908
Finally I am lucky at something.

330
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,990
You were lucky at love.

331
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,736
Yeah, sure, baby.

332
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,246
Hey, Bart, check this out.

333
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,249
Look at me, I'm Mr. Fatso!

334
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,134
(laughing)

335
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,011
It's funny 'cause
it's so preposterous.

336
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,669
(nervous laughing)
Yeah.

337
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,677
-Hmm...
-We've hit the big time!

338
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,430
"I, Carumba"?!

339
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,352
Not so loud.

340
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,770
If my dad
hears about the show,

341
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,268
he might realize
Mr. Fatso is him.

342
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,691
What the...?

343
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,019
<i>HOMER:</i>
<i>You idiot. Mr. Fatso is you!</i>

344
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,185
What? No. It can't be.

345
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,113
<i>That's right, numbskull.</i>

346
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:28,952
<i>Your son's made a fool of you</i>
<i>in front of the whole town.</i>

347
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,279
Shut up! I'll fix you!

348
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,735
(gulping)

349
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,286
<i>Well, I'll fix you.</i>

350
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,120
<i>Go drive a car!</i>

351
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,325
Yes, master.

352
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,456
Here, car!
Here, boy!

353
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,634
Excellent installation, dude.

354
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,967
And a great excuse for me
to bust out my courtroom jacket.

355
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,433
Thanks, guys. I, um...

356
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:58,063
Ooh, this collar's feeling
pretty tight.

357
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,812
(grunts)
Help! Help!

358
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,604
(posters growling)

359
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,398
Oh, this is just a dream.

360
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,192
All I have to do is wake up.

361
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,776
-Why, you little...
-(choking)

362
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,782
Pay for your genius!

363
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,204
Oh, what's the use?

364
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:18,333
When a man isn't a hero
to his son, he's nothing.

365
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,130
I like what used to make
a neighborhood look dangerous

366
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,796
now makes it look sophisticated.

367
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,095
I like how the painting
makes more than I do.

368
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,929
Looks like Dad's not coming.

369
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,644
He won't leave the car.

370
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,774
I can see how this show
might not be to his liking.

371
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,569
Come on, Dad.

372
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,898
You made me mad,
so I got back at you.

373
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,364
How was I to know
parents had feelings?

374
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,195
Well, we do.

375
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,950
I want to show you
I understand how you feel.

376
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,453
And they say a picture's
worth a 1,000 words.

377
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,666
You just ruined my car.

378
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,460
Correction, it's worth
ten times as much.

379
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,844
$500! Whoo-hoo!

380
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,672
-Thanks, boy.
-You're welcome.

381
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,547
And from now on, Dad,
if anyone laughs at you,

382
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,135
they've gotta go through me.

383
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,850
Really? Anyone?

384
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,470
What about the Hulk
riding a rhinoceros?

385
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,137
Would you stop him
from laughing?

386
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,396
Wait, is the Hulk laughing,
or the rhinoceros?

387
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,769
Both, but the rhinoceros
doesn't know why.

388
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,066
He's just trying to fit in.

389
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,569
Dad, it's getting
cold out here.

390
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,492
-(clinking glass)
-Art lovers and Bart lovers!

391
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,701
First of all, I'd like to thank
the good folks

392
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,332
at <i>Springfield Arts Daily</i>
for setting this up.

393
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,039
Thank you for bringing us
a fresh new voice.

394
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,751
-(chuckles) Yes..
-Yes... yes.

395
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:48,092
As a graffiti artist, there are
so many people to thank...

396
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,958
people who build walls...

397
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,005
nighttime, for being dark...

398
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,430
Hold it right there,
Spray-candy Warhol!

399
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,010
(gun cocks)

400
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,597
Bart Simpson, you're under arrest
for tagging the town.

401
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,064
This overdue art-quake
that taught us all

402
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,855
a new way of seeing, was actually

403
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,768
a police department sting.

404
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,187
It was?

405
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,275
Yeah. Do you think people
would be stupid enough

406
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,990
to pay for something
some amateur

407
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,280
put on a wall for nothing?

408
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,203
Oh, no, indeed!

409
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,202
Now if I can just get
my $3,000,000 back.

410
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,445
No refunds.

411
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,246
But he just said
the show was a sham.

412
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,459
Oh, it is. And I'm just
a guy sitting at a table.

413
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,040
The only thing that's real
is the sign that says "no refunds."

414
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,876
Ooh...

415
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,881
Wait, Chief. I must know...

416
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,213
who tipped you off?

417
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,718
Eh, probably shouldn't
tell you this,

418
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,429
but, uh, it was
our undercover officer,

419
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,470
Shepard Fairey.

420
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,562
You're an undercover cop?

421
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,770
Hey, don't be so surprised.

422
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,191
I spent 20 years putting up
posters that said "obey."

423
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,731
What gives, Daddy-O?

424
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:54,034
I thought you were the dean
of the underground scene.

425
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,949
I'm not in the business of
helping out posers anymore.

426
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,489
Now, I just sell stuff to them.

427
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,082
Wait, wait, wait!

428
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,489
He's just a boy.

429
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,247
Do you have to put him in jail?

430
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,829
Well, we've gotta teach
him a lesson somehow.

431
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,665
Hmm...

432
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,500
Chief, I believe I have the answer
in the back of my car.

433
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,419
Hm!

434
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,763
There you go.

435
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,434
Thanks for coming out.

436
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,313
I need to go
to the bathroom.

437
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,892
Uh, knock yourself out.

438
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,863
All right, time's up!

439
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,236
Aw, aw, aw, no!

440
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,988
{\an8}(acapella theme)

441
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,367
-(murmuring)
-Shh!
