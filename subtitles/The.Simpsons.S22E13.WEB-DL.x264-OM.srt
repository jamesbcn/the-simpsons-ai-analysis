00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:55,324

Da-yee...

9
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:40,769
You know,

10
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,204
I love our Valentine's Day
tradition

11
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:43,989
of going out with
each other's sisters.

12
00:01:44,073 --> 00:01:46,124
Is there anything better
than my best friend's face

13
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:48,660
on a girl body?
Not that I can think of.

14
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:50,362
Nothing better.

15
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,814
Boy, I love
Valentine's Day.

16
00:01:52,882 --> 00:01:56,051
Stir a drop of Jagermeister
into some pink lemonade,

17
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:58,086
slice in some
strawberry ChapStick,

18
00:01:58,154 --> 00:01:59,571
Mmm...
call it Cupid's ambrosia,

19
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:02,240
and you can charge
up to the wazoo.

20
00:02:02,308 --> 00:02:05,310
Now all you need are customers.

21
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:09,431
Well, better get home
to the little woman.

22
00:02:11,868 --> 00:02:13,335
Do <i>you</i> have plans
for tonight?

23
00:02:13,403 --> 00:02:15,304
What, are you crazy?
Of course I do.

24
00:02:15,371 --> 00:02:16,705
Got a hot date.

25
00:02:16,773 --> 00:02:18,907
Come on, scram,
so I can get ready.

26
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:23,345
I'm telling you,
I'm fine.

27
00:02:23,413 --> 00:02:24,546
I never been happier.

28
00:02:24,614 --> 00:02:25,881
See? There.

29
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:27,683
There, that's a smile, right?

30
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,052
Showing teeth, eyes all crinkly.

31
00:02:34,157 --> 00:02:36,358
Hey, hey, stop
opening doors!

32
00:02:39,662 --> 00:02:43,298
<i>Coming up next on</i> World of War,
Hmm?

33
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:46,501
<i>"Hitler and Eva Braun:</i>
<i>Crazy in Love."</i>

34
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:48,437
Even <i>you</i> let me down, Hitler!

35
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:51,340
Hey, you! Spending
Valentine's Day by yourself?

36
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:52,674
Huhza?

37
00:02:52,742 --> 00:02:54,526
If you're watching this alone,

38
00:02:54,594 --> 00:02:57,863
your love life is like
<i>Sister Act 3--</i> no Whoopi!

39
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,532
I <i>knew</i> my love life
was like that movie somehow.

40
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,735
Well, I'm gonna tell you
my secrets right now...

41
00:03:03,803 --> 00:03:06,972
if "right now" means
tomorrow night at my seminar

42
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,974
<i>at the Springfield Airport</i>
<i>Motor Lodge.</i>

43
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:10,208
So, if you're ready

44
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:11,760
<i>to turn from couch potato</i>

45
00:03:11,828 --> 00:03:13,495

come and see me,
Dr. Kissingher.

47
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:19,067
Eh, what have I got to lose.

48
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:20,635
They say for every man

49
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:22,804
somewhere on Earth
there's one woman.

50
00:03:39,105 --> 00:03:40,772
Homer!

51
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,575
We only have five minutes
until the school bus comes.

52
00:03:43,643 --> 00:03:46,578
Drive my kids to school! Never!

53
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:52,400
Stupid double snuggler's hitch!

54
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,001
Only hope is to chew off my leg!

55
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,035
Ow!

56
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,337
Ow!

57
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,637
Mmm, not bad.

58
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:03,442
Just 127 more hours.

59
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:08,446
Wha...?

60
00:04:13,518 --> 00:04:15,552
My first gray hair!

61
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,554
Oh, Marge, don't worry.

62
00:04:17,622 --> 00:04:20,024
A lot of movie stars
have gray hair,

63
00:04:20,092 --> 00:04:23,093
like all those women
we loved in the '80s.

64
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:27,030
Homie, you always
mean to say

65
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:29,132
the nicest things.

66
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,535
Well, it's not easy with
you talking all the time.

67
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,861
Uh, excuse me,
is this the seminar

68
00:04:42,928 --> 00:04:45,597
where you learn
how to pick up free escorts?

69
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:48,266
Well, we're not learning
how to fold cloth napkins.

70
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:52,404
Well, I got excited
for nothing.

71
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:54,204
Gentlemen,

72
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:57,140
prepare for the potentate
of the potent date,

73
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,544
the know-it-all of the protocol
of the booty call,

74
00:05:00,612 --> 00:05:05,015
Dr. Kiss... ing... her!

75
00:05:08,553 --> 00:05:10,854
Once we were
single-celled organisms

76
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:13,055
who could replicate
whenever we wanted.

77
00:05:14,592 --> 00:05:16,593
We were men back then!

78
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,728
But today we need more help.
Who's first?

79
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:21,598
You! The guy who's been here
since 3:00 this afternoon.

80
00:05:21,665 --> 00:05:24,000
It's hell to meet girls when
you're paid in chickens.

81
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:26,535
Okay, I'm a sexy girl,
and research shows

82
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:28,504
that my decision
to sleep with you

83
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:31,006
happens in
the first 6.5 seconds.

84
00:05:31,073 --> 00:05:32,107
Go!

85
00:05:32,174 --> 00:05:33,509
Eh, my name's Willie,

86
00:05:33,576 --> 00:05:35,977
and, uh, all I do
is get drunk

87
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:38,146
and kill squirrels
with me shovel.

88
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:41,907
Okay, now I'll translate that
into romance language.

89
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,776
Hi. I'm William.

90
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,778
I'm a connoisseur
of fine spirits,

91
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,014
and I love animals to death.

92
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:50,749
Do me next!
Do me next!

93
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,784
Ah! A monster! Save me!

94
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,220
Sorry, that
was unprofessional.

95
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:56,555
Please, go on.

96
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:57,722
Name's Moe Szyslak.

97
00:05:57,789 --> 00:05:59,624
As a kid, I had roundworm.

98
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:02,660
Heck, I was more worm
than boy for a couple of years.

99
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:04,128
I dabbled
in Satanism

100
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:05,897
until I was
asked to leave.

101
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:09,400
Oh, and one month, I ate
nothing but aquarium fish.

102
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:11,602
Your only hope
is to use a wingman.

103
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,170
Uh, what's a wingman?

104
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:15,171
A wingman is a friend...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

105
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:16,840
Now I got to
find a <i>friend?</i>

106
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:18,742
You need someone
who's secretly on your side,

107
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:20,744
making you look good to women.

108
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:23,880
But he can't more handsome
or appealing than you. Okay,

109
00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:26,115
let's take a flip
through the old Moe-lodex.

110
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:27,216
Ooh.

111
00:06:27,284 --> 00:06:29,852
Bingo. That was a weird day.

112
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,120
Sir, would you
be my wingman?

113
00:06:32,188 --> 00:06:33,689
We could try it out
this weekend

114
00:06:33,757 --> 00:06:35,791
at the "Faculty Follies"
after-party.

115
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:39,161
One thing-- what if there's
a woman we both like?

116
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:41,931
Well, we'll use the time-honored
"I saw her first" rule.

117
00:06:41,998 --> 00:06:45,434
What if I see her hand at the same time
you see her face?

118
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:47,134
Face beats hand!

119
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:51,172
So, after dinner
I cut his hair,

120
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:53,608
and he readjusted
my mortgage.

121
00:06:53,676 --> 00:06:55,843
That's what he does.

122
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:58,446
And how was your
Valentine's Day?

123
00:06:58,513 --> 00:07:00,414
Very romantic.

124
00:07:00,482 --> 00:07:04,051
Homer had the basketball game
muted the whole time.

125
00:07:04,118 --> 00:07:06,352
Oh, and then I found
a gray hair-- no big deal.

126
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,021
Mmm.

127
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:10,557
Marge, it's time I
told you the truth.

128
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,594
You've been grayer than
a Seattle Cinco de Mayo

129
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:14,928
for years now.

130
00:07:14,996 --> 00:07:17,064
Really?

131
00:07:17,131 --> 00:07:19,398
Yes, the dye not only
colors your hair,

132
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:22,334
but the fumes wipe the
experience from your mind.

133
00:07:22,402 --> 00:07:24,336
Jimothy, Aquanetta,

134
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:25,437
is touch-up time!

135
00:07:25,505 --> 00:07:27,139
Gloves and foil, people!

136
00:07:27,207 --> 00:07:29,141
Let's go!
Crinkle, crinkle!

137
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:30,943
Whoa! Whoa!

138
00:07:33,313 --> 00:07:35,146
Oh, Janis,
I'm so sorry.

139
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:36,681
Can we reschedule?

140
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:38,950
It's a battle of the
Blue and Gray here,

141
00:07:39,018 --> 00:07:41,452
and I am Gaybraham
Lincoln, baby.

142
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,722
Oh, that's okay.
I only needed a touch-up.

143
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:45,690
My husband and I
can use the time

144
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:48,827
to take a long,
romantic walk.

145
00:07:48,894 --> 00:07:52,329
Hmm, she doesn't seem so
worried about <i>her</i> gray hair.

146
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:55,666
Oh, <i>her</i> self-confidence
doesn't come from a bottle.

147
00:07:55,734 --> 00:07:59,703
Now, let's rub this toxic
blue goo onto your scalp.

148
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,739
Mm-hmm.

149
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:04,174
A little of that.

150
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:05,708
Mix it up.

151
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,976
Mm-hmm.

152
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:14,917
Hmm.

153
00:08:20,724 --> 00:08:22,691
I brought home fried chicken.

154
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:25,493
And a completely new hairstyle.

155
00:08:29,265 --> 00:08:32,100
A completely new hairstyle.

156
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,884
So, what do you think?

157
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,821
She wants an honest answer.
What do we do?

158
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:46,390
I don't know.
I don't know!

159
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,591
We could fake
a stroke.

160
00:08:47,658 --> 00:08:49,026
The last time
we faked a stroke,

161
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:50,461
it led to a real one.

162
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:51,862
We're running out of time,
people.

163
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:54,198
We need an answer,
and it has to be great!

164
00:08:57,034 --> 00:08:59,702
So... chicken.

165
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:01,137
Hmm.

166
00:09:01,205 --> 00:09:02,571
<i>D'oh!</i>

167
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,042
Well, what do you kids
think of the real me? Huh?

168
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,410
I love it.

169
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:09,312
I know I use the word
"empowering" a lot,

170
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,514
but this time,
it really is that.

171
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:12,914
I just have one question
about hair.

172
00:09:12,982 --> 00:09:14,582
Where does mine start?

173
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,485
Head, head, head, hair.

174
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:17,986
Where's the border?

175
00:09:18,054 --> 00:09:20,455
Oh, my God. Me, too!

176
00:09:22,058 --> 00:09:23,858
What are we?

177
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:25,527
What do you
think, Homie?

178
00:09:25,594 --> 00:09:28,129
Sweetie, you've always
been beautiful,

179
00:09:28,196 --> 00:09:30,664
but now you're
my silver belle.

180
00:09:30,732 --> 00:09:33,300
Let me get the camera
we use for precious moments

181
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:34,902
and insurance claims.

182
00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:38,739
What has she done?

183
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:40,408
I feel like I'm married
to Richard Gere.

184
00:09:42,244 --> 00:09:43,844
I can't talk now.
I'm talking to myself.

185
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:45,278
No, no, Homer. Go ahead.

186
00:09:45,463 --> 00:09:46,929
Thanks, Homer.
It'll just ba a minute.

187
00:09:46,997 --> 00:09:48,598
What's up?
Hey, wingman,

188
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,167
you're supposed to be
here like you promised.

189
00:09:50,234 --> 00:09:52,869
Oh, thank you, prior obligation.

190
00:09:58,276 --> 00:10:00,176
I can't take it.

191
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:02,744
I'm just going to draw
a hairline on.

192
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:06,848
So, basically,

193
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,885
my job is to make you
look good by comparison.

194
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:12,721
Like West Virginia
does for Virginia.

195
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:17,925
The good doctor
has just the prescription.

196
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,927
"Jumping on the Grenade:"

197
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,763
the wingman engages
the less attractive friend,

198
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,200
isolating the target.
Voop!

199
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:28,636
You ever notice that pizzas
have gotten so small lately?

200
00:10:28,704 --> 00:10:30,104
They're like dimes.

201
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,906
Yes, that's exactly it!

202
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:34,308
Well, a girl
could starve to death!

203
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,776
Wow, your friend did
something I could never do.

204
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,278
What's that?

205
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,779
Walk away from you.

206
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,783
"Taking Down a Rival,"
aka "Talk Blocking."

207
00:10:45,286 --> 00:10:48,854
So, Lenny, ever get
that rebar out of your head?

208
00:10:48,922 --> 00:10:50,189
No, they just
sawed off the ends

209
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:51,457
and painted over the nubs.

210
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,593
Hey, where you going, baby?

211
00:10:54,861 --> 00:10:57,330
Oh, no, you don't.

212
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:02,134
Nice talk-blocking.

213
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:04,002
Would you be willing
to wingman for me?

214
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,204
Well, I don't know.
It's a lot of work.

215
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:08,506
Oh, I just ordered this
bottomless pitcher of beer

216
00:11:08,574 --> 00:11:10,631
and circumference-less
platter of nachos.

217
00:11:10,877 --> 00:11:12,511
Deal!

218
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:15,881
Need some cooling
down, hot stuff?

219
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:21,323
<i>Okay, just imagine</i>
<i>she's a Bond girl.</i>

220
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:23,192
<i>Oh! Judi Dench?!</i>

221
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,562
Kiss me, 007.

222
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,097
Good show,

223
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:30,466
Mr. Bond.

224
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:39,641
Help! My macaroni Marconi!

225
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:40,676
Hmm?

226
00:11:42,612 --> 00:11:45,280
Bart, what happened
to your Mom's hair?

227
00:11:45,348 --> 00:11:48,984
Did she see something scary like
that vampire on <i>Sesame Street?</i>

228
00:11:49,051 --> 00:11:51,052
They should warn you
when he's coming.

229
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,521
I don't want to talk
about my Mom's hair.

230
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,990
Right. It's just weird.

231
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:57,792
Normally, I think
your mom is hot...

232
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,494
Take that back!
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:01,596
What I mean is,
she's not hot anymore.

234
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,964
Take <i>that</i> back!

235
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,933
So moody!

236
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:08,469
Just like my mom
on her "can't dance" days.

237
00:12:12,673 --> 00:12:14,340
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

238
00:12:15,977 --> 00:12:18,745
Huh. Let's see
what cousin Jessica's up to.

239
00:12:21,682 --> 00:12:25,283
There's a woman
who's got it all under control.

240
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:28,671
Hmm?

241
00:12:28,739 --> 00:12:31,807
Ooh!

242
00:12:31,825 --> 00:12:35,060
Marge, your hair--
it's fantastic!

243
00:12:35,128 --> 00:12:36,729
Well, thank you.

244
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,031
No, thank you
for your bravery.

245
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:43,000
I hope I look half
as good as you

246
00:12:43,068 --> 00:12:44,836
when I give up.

247
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:46,938
Such audacity!

248
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:49,173
Grandma had hair
like that

249
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:52,310
when she went to sleep
in her forever box.

250
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:02,966
You can't listen
to those women, Mom.

251
00:13:03,034 --> 00:13:04,500
Change threatens them.

252
00:13:04,568 --> 00:13:06,536
They didn't like it

253
00:13:06,604 --> 00:13:08,471
when the <i>Springfield Shopper</i>
started printing in color.

254
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,440
Neither did I.

255
00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:13,009
I didn't want to know what color
the Statue of Liberty was.

256
00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:15,178
But you know what?
I was wrong.

257
00:13:15,246 --> 00:13:16,613
And these ladies are, too.

258
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,549
Ma'am, do you have any
kind of a discount card?

259
00:13:20,617 --> 00:13:22,184
What kind of card?

260
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:25,520
Well, you know, maybe
you belong to the A.A...

261
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:27,456
The A.A.? No!

262
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:29,024
Oh, no, I meant
the A.A...

263
00:13:29,092 --> 00:13:30,592
A.A.A.?

264
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,394
No, I'm not in Triple-A.

265
00:13:32,462 --> 00:13:35,130
I don't like
their <i>Westways</i> magazine.

266
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:36,798
They'll give four diamonds

267
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:38,900
to any place
that's got a lid on the toilet.

268
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:42,336
No, I meant the A.A... R...

269
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:47,041
P?!

270
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:49,644
The A.A.R.P.?!

271
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:51,945
Well, that tears it.

272
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:54,815
I don't want this milk,
and I'm not gonna take it back.

273
00:13:54,883 --> 00:13:57,985
That's okay. We have a young
man who does that for you.

274
00:13:58,052 --> 00:13:59,486
Oh, right here, ma'am.

275
00:13:59,553 --> 00:14:01,121
Oh, boy, a put-back!

276
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:03,791
I hope it takes me
by the freezer section.

277
00:14:03,858 --> 00:14:07,593
Stick my head in the pizza case,
it's like a ski vacation!

278
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:10,729
I can imagine the pepperonis
are Swiss chalets

279
00:14:10,798 --> 00:14:14,033
nestled in a big layer
of mozzarella snow!

280
00:14:15,602 --> 00:14:18,437
Bart, eyewitnesses
to your fight described you

281
00:14:18,505 --> 00:14:21,073
as "berserkoid,"
"totally aggro,"

282
00:14:21,141 --> 00:14:24,009
and said you punched Milhouse,
"like, 50 billion times."

283
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:26,144
That's an excessive
number of times.

284
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:29,147
What's bothering you, son?

285
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:31,316
I-I don't want to talk about it.

286
00:14:31,383 --> 00:14:33,384
Thank God.
I don't want to, either.

287
00:14:33,452 --> 00:14:38,255
Remember, Bart, anything
you say here is confidential.

288
00:14:38,323 --> 00:14:39,857
Can we close the door?

289
00:14:39,925 --> 00:14:41,091
Oh, there is no door.

290
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,293
State regulations.

291
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,694
Hey, Bart!

292
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:45,362
Still freaking out

293
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,631
'cause your mom aged 30 years
in a day?

294
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:48,999
Don't judge them too harshly.

295
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:50,667
They recently learned

296
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:52,369
they were once two-thirds
of conjoined triplets.

297
00:14:52,437 --> 00:14:54,237
And the third one
is out for revenge.

298
00:14:54,305 --> 00:14:57,373
Now, Bart, share your most
intimate thoughts with me.

299
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:59,008
I don't think I want to.

300
00:14:59,076 --> 00:15:00,877
Oh. Well, maybe it'd be easier

301
00:15:00,945 --> 00:15:04,480
for you to talk
to my colleague, Dr. Thera-bear.

302
00:15:04,548 --> 00:15:07,416
Well...

303
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:09,418
Hold on. I'm not allowed
in the room

304
00:15:09,486 --> 00:15:11,286
while you talk
to the bear.

305
00:15:12,922 --> 00:15:17,559
All right, I know there's
a camera in you somewhere.

306
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:24,532
They never think to look behind
the jazz-fest poster.

307
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:28,769
So it's true.

308
00:15:28,837 --> 00:15:31,038
Your hair committed
blue-icide.

309
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,142
I thought you'd
be more supportive.

310
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,710
I mean, you went
gray yourselves.

311
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:38,279
No, we didn't.

312
00:15:38,347 --> 00:15:40,481
This is just
smoke and ash.

313
00:15:47,554 --> 00:15:49,055
So what does your husband,

314
00:15:49,123 --> 00:15:50,991
Vidal Baboon,
think of the new look?

315
00:15:51,058 --> 00:15:52,458
He loves it!

316
00:15:52,526 --> 00:15:54,995
He calls me his
silver belle.

317
00:15:55,062 --> 00:15:56,529
That means he hates it.

318
00:15:56,597 --> 00:15:58,330
If he really liked it,

319
00:15:58,398 --> 00:16:01,000
he'd just paw at it
instead of getting all clever.

320
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:02,534
Why are you always trying

321
00:16:02,602 --> 00:16:04,203
to cause trouble
with me and Homer?

322
00:16:04,271 --> 00:16:06,272
Our marriage is rock solid!

323
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:09,241
So, do you think Homer is gonna
be at Club Zipless tonight?

324
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:10,509
I sure hope so.

325
00:16:11,744 --> 00:16:13,345
Oops, dropped my stirrer.

326
00:16:13,413 --> 00:16:14,779
D'oh!
D'oh!

327
00:16:16,348 --> 00:16:19,417
Well, Marge.
Ready to kick Homer to the curb?

328
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:21,319
I can bend him
like Beckham.

329
00:16:21,387 --> 00:16:23,754
Sorry, but I'm
fighting for my man!

330
00:16:23,822 --> 00:16:26,324
Give me a double espresso to go.

331
00:16:26,392 --> 00:16:27,858
Ma'am, are you
sure that's wise,

332
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:30,227
with what I presume
is your heart condition?

333
00:16:30,295 --> 00:16:31,661
Ooh!

334
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:37,200
Whoo!

335
00:16:37,268 --> 00:16:38,601
Go, granny, go!

336
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:42,772
Aw, geez, she's coming back!

337
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,074
Run, bullies, run!

338
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,017
Look out, chicks.

339
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,485
The silver fox
is coming to the henhouse.

340
00:17:06,357 --> 00:17:09,092
I'm okay, I'm okay.

341
00:17:13,831 --> 00:17:15,165
Brambles!

342
00:17:29,512 --> 00:17:31,314
Shoo! Shoo, shoo, shoo,
shoo, shoo, shoo!

343
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,821
I'm looking for Homer Simpson.

344
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:41,556
What, did he eat
your candy house

345
00:17:41,623 --> 00:17:43,258
and push you into the oven?

346
00:17:43,326 --> 00:17:45,726
Odd, that's what the valet
just asked me.

347
00:17:45,794 --> 00:17:46,995
How ya doin'?

348
00:17:47,063 --> 00:17:48,529
Nice to see ya.
Life is good?

349
00:17:48,597 --> 00:17:50,898
Can't complain.
Can't or won't?

350
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:53,968
You just crossed
a line, pally. Mm.

351
00:17:56,304 --> 00:17:57,671
Oh, Homer,

352
00:17:57,738 --> 00:18:00,574
I've never seen a drunk
hold his vomit like you.

353
00:18:02,377 --> 00:18:03,877
I do keep it together.

354
00:18:05,847 --> 00:18:07,246
Oh. Who is that?

355
00:18:07,314 --> 00:18:08,514
I don't know,
but she looks...

356
00:18:08,582 --> 00:18:11,117
Uh-oh. Usually when
it gets this quiet

357
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:13,252
Mr. Burns is standing behind me.

358
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,521
Actually, I'm standing
in front of you.

359
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:17,190
I decided to hit
the local nighteries

360
00:18:17,257 --> 00:18:19,058
with my trusted wingman.

361
00:18:19,126 --> 00:18:20,393
I flew the first packet

362
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:23,495
of royal mail across
the Khyber Pass,

363
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:25,663
dodging the
poison-tipped spears

364
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:26,898
of the dreaded
Zim-Zam Tribe.

365
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:30,502
So, which of you wants
to be the sliced haddock

366
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:32,637
in a geezer sandwich?

367
00:18:32,705 --> 00:18:36,074
Hmm. There's a lot of beefcake
on the grill tonight.

368
00:18:36,142 --> 00:18:38,343
Get your hands off my husband!

369
00:18:40,178 --> 00:18:43,047
This is a situation I call
"The Doctor Is Out"

370
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:45,349
Marge, what are
you doing here?

371
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,451
This bar is for singles
and wingmen only.

372
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,952
That's your wife?

373
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:51,755
Do you see her
as we see her?

374
00:18:57,861 --> 00:19:00,397
Marge, Marge, put
down that broom.

375
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:03,233
You've got nothing to be
afraid of from them.

376
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,035
I'm a wingman.

377
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,802
Part of a great tradition

378
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,072
including Val Kilmer
from <i>Top Gun,</i>

379
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,208
Wedge Antilles from <i>Star Wars,</i>
and me, from now.

380
00:19:13,276 --> 00:19:15,577
And you know why
I'm a great wingman?

381
00:19:15,645 --> 00:19:17,112
Because I have
the confidence

382
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,815
that comes from knowing
I get to go home to you.

383
00:19:20,883 --> 00:19:22,117
Oh.

384
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:26,688
And you know what else this
whole experience has taught me?

385
00:19:26,756 --> 00:19:29,890
True beauty
isn't about hair color?

386
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,192
Probably.

387
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,927
But be honest...

388
00:19:32,994 --> 00:19:36,397
when I say "beautiful woman,"
what pops into your head?

389
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:45,905
Well, I guess I do
have a type.

390
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:53,613
Mom, your choice to go back
to blue is so empowering.

391
00:19:53,681 --> 00:19:56,783
But you said going from
blue to gray was empowering.

392
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,618
Well, as a feminist,
virtually anything

393
00:19:58,686 --> 00:20:01,187
a woman does is empowering.
Oh.

394
00:20:01,254 --> 00:20:03,789
Is my job creating power,
empowering?

395
00:20:03,856 --> 00:20:06,525
No. It's oddly
dehumanizing.

396
00:20:06,593 --> 00:20:08,759
Hey, Dad, did you
color your hair, too?

397
00:20:10,062 --> 00:20:12,363
Only my hairdresser
knows for sure.

398
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:16,167
Oh, hello, young man!

399
00:20:16,235 --> 00:20:17,635
Where's your father?

400
00:20:17,703 --> 00:20:19,770
He's dying
in a retirement home.

401
00:20:19,838 --> 00:20:21,739
Now kiss me.

402
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:24,766
Shh!
