That was cold-blooded, Marge.

177

-Yeah.
-But it's not fair.

178
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,902
Adults always blame kids
for everything.

179
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,060
Well, if kids are so innocent,

180
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,358
{\an8}why is everything bad
named after them?

181
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:08,402
{\an8}Acting childish, kidnapping,
child abuse.

182
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,158
What about adultery?

183
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,529
Not until you're older, son.

198

Huh. You two scofflaws

199
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,236
I'm taking you downtown.

205

for one night only.

206
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,803
And they've got cotton candy
and hats with feathers.

207
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,092
And there's no lines

208
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:13,925
because all the stupid kids
have curfew, so...

209
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:15,972
Oh, right. Sorry.

210
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,984

-Hmm.
-(sighs)

212
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,231
Why don't you kids play
one of your old board games?

213
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,819
{\an8}When was the last time
you played <i>Citizenship?</i>

214
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,530

216
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,656
Oh, can't we just go to bed?

217
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,450
It's only 5:30.

218
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,494
Fine. We'll play

219
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,084
Oh, the hippo's missing.

220

You think that's bad?

222
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,000
I had to talk
to my mom all night.

She's got problems.
Scary problems.

224

Adults blow.

225
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,598
Yeah. Just look at them
over there.

226
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,008
Smoking their cigarettes.

227
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,517
Drinking their coffee.

228
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,886
Scratching their big butts.

229
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,845

Gee, chief,
all those gears and motors

00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,783

235
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,038
Well, you got to spend money

236
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,160

347
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,409
Homer's done a ton of crap
that never made the papers.

348
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,623
My mom shoplifts all the time,

349
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,164
stuff she doesn't even need.

350
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,957
My dad gets in car accidents
on purpose.

351
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,092
Great. This is all gold.

352
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,669
MILHOUSE: We got to spread
this stuff around.

353
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,125
Let's put it on the Internet.

354
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,674
BART:
No, we have to reach people

355
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,678
whose opinions actually matter,

356
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,510
and I think I know how.

357
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,635
Why don't we just...

358
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:34,771

200 channels,

366
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,633
So, Marge,
ready for another episode

367
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,425
of <i>Don't Go There?</i>

368
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,469
I'm tired of that show,

369
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,352
but I've been hearing
good things about <i>Talk to the Hand</i>.

370
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,016
Tom Shales says the writing
snaps, crackles, and pops.

371
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,728
Okay, whatever takes
my mind off my life.

Grandpa's old radio.

I'm afraid it is, chief.

D'oh!

about those blabbermouth kids

00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,072

417
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,287
Hey, shut up, Mayor.
They're telling secrets again.

00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,161

428
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,438

-Can't we just blow it up?
-You go ahead, girlfriend.

Ah, I got nothing.
How about you, frinky?

436
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,963
I have captured the signal,

triangulating the vectors

438
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,554

as a function of my hand.

00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,178

who's been practicing medicine

442

447
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,029
Brilliant.

448
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,532
They transduced
amplitude modulation

449
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:21,414
via the concavity of that over-sized
beverage conveyance.

450
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,203
I mean,
that is some clever goyvin.

451
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,288
All right, you kids,
come down now.

452
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,793
We promise, we won't kill you.

453

Speak for yourself.
Bart, get down here!

454
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,207
I'm going to spank you
back to the Stone Age.

You can't make us come down.
