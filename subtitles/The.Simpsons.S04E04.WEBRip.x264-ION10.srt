than my little girl.

181
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,575
Hmm. You're looking at her
through a father's eyes.

182
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,579
Well, if I could gouge out
somebody else's eyes

183
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,331
and shove them
into my sockets,

184
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,503
I would, but to me
she's beautiful.

185
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,462
That is so sweet.

186
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:26,013
Honey, no one's going to
force you to do anything,

187
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,468
but do you know
how your father

188
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,428
got the money to enter you
in this pageant?

189
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,719
Nope.

190
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:34,141
He sold his ride
on the Duff blimp.

191
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,522
But that ride
meant everything to him.

Tina Epstein?

196
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,454
Whoa. If you're gonna binge,
you'd better purge.

197
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,485
Uh-oh.

198
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:02,879
Amber Dempsey.

199
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,129
In the same week,
she was Pork Princess

200
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,711
and Little Miss Kosher.

201
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,586
She's beautiful.

202
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,013
Wait, she's about to
bring out the big guns.

203
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,258
Eyelash implants.

204
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,966
I thought those
were illegal.

205
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,976
Not in Paraguay.

206
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,688
There's no way I can
beat this girl.

207
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,308
She's the Jack Nicklaus
of the pageant circuit.

208
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,806
Oh, I don't know
that she's as attractive

209
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,477
as Jack Nicklaus.

210
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,947
(humming)

211
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,699
I meant because they both
win all the time, Mom.

212
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,412
Oh. Well, yes.
That's what I meant, too.

213
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,043
Well, tell you what.

214
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,080
This afternoon, I'll take you
to the beauty parlor

215
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,793
and show you just
how lovely you can be.

216
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,714
And later, I'll teach you
the tricks of the trade--

217
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,633
taping your swimsuit
to your butt,

218
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,422
petroleum jelly on your teeth
for that frictionless smile,

219
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,466
and the ancient art
of padding.

220
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,720
(purring)

221
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,024
Are we done?

222
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,229
We are just warming up.

223
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,771
Oh. Isn't this dangerous?

224
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,895
Don't worry.

225
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,821
I am well protected.

226
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,408
Boy, when Lisa comes in
I want you to

227
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,753
make a big fuss
over how she looks.

228
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,579
She'll see through me
like grandma's underpants.

229
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,705
No, she won't.

230
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,711
When it comes
to compliments,

231
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,303
women are ravenous,
bloodsucking monsters,

232
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,718
always wanting
more, more, more!

233
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,088
And if you give it to them,

234
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,045
you'll get plenty back
in return.

235
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,255
Like what?

236
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,255
I'll tell you when you're older.

Ooh, I got

241
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,686
There's
an angel missing.

242
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,698

school friend?

243

244

246
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,247

247
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,830
who are going to get
a special dinner tonight.

248
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,883
-Hey, hey!
-Woo-hoo!

249
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,631

about women?

250
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,843
Nope, that's it.

You've been nursing that
thing for an hour.

253
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,808

I was just wondering

254
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,559
how someone who works
in an ice cream store

255
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,061
keeps such a trim figure.

256
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,443
