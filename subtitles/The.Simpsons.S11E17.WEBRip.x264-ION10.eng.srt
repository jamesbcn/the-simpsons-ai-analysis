{\an8}Let's see,

{\an8}we're getting close.

{\an8}I'm not sure mosquito season

18
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,178
{\an8}is the best time to visit Larva Lake.

00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,814
{\an8}Folks, you're gonna
want to turn around.

{\an8}The bugs are firmly in charge.

22

-Please, just go.

{\an8}Hey, an Indian casino.

31
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,621

Come on, come on, come on.

34
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,211
{\an8}Homer, you know I had
a gambling problem.

35
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,507
{\an8}Well, what better place
to celebrate your recovery

36

00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:17,968
{\an8}Hmph.

{\an8}Lisa?

40
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,639
{\an8}Ah, something troubles me
about Indian gaming.

41
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,805
On the one hand,
the revenue helps the tribe...

42
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,484
HOMER: Sure we can't talk you into it?

43
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,733
-No minors.
-Yeah, but I really want to--

44
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,067
{\an8}Sorry, son.

45
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,902
{\an8}Although they seem strange to us

46
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,407
{\an8}we must respect the ways
of the Indian.

52
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,801
{\an8}We'll give you a free pass
to the pasta bar.

53
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,966

{\an8}Quiet, Gabbo.

59
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,899
{\an8}I'd like to introduce you
to my little wooden friend.

60
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,355

00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,958
{\an8}All right!

67
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,750
{\an8}Time for some underage gambling.

68
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,883
{\an8}So long, sucker.

00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,045
{\an8}(exclaims)

70
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,046
{\an8}Your linen service has broken
many promises to us.

71
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,347
{\an8}Laundry bills soar like eagle.

72
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,431
{\an8}Jerk.

73
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,444
{\an8}So...

74
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,096
You like to sneak into casinos.

75
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,478
I wasn't going to gamble.

76
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,774
I just wanted a Bloody Mary.

77
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,147
Listen to me.

78
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,574
Unless you change
your deceitful ways

79
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,993
I foresee a life of bitterness
and failure for you...

80
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,033
Bart Simpson.

81
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,485
How'd you know my name?

82
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,075
Your father just took out
a second mortgage downstairs.

83
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,581
You're listed as collateral.

84
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:10,003
Oh, I thought maybe you were
some kind of Indian mystic

85
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,333
who could tell the future.

86
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,787
Who says I'm not?

87
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:13,837
Whoa!

88
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,634
If you want to see your future

89
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,474
throw a treasured
personal item into the fire.

90
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,970
OK. (exclaims)

91
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,012
(loud pop)

92
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,425
Not a firecracker!

93
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,683
Hey, I bought it from a guy
on your reservation.

94
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,015
That's Crazy Talk.

95
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,560
-No, it's true.
-No, I know.

96
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,063
That's my brother, Crazy Talk.

97
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,774
We're all
a little worried about him.

98
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,818
Now, look into the flame.

99
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,610
Look ahead 30 years

100
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,744
to the man you will become.

101
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,327
BART: <i>Ew, that's me</i>
<i>in the future?</i>

102
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,451
CASINO MANAGER: <i>Quiet.</i>
<i>You're about to say something.</i>

103

{\an8}(belches)

104
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,588
Check, check.

105
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,589
Hello, Capital City.

106
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,221
Oh, way to make a guitar, Sears.

107
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,219
Hey, Bart, any clean towels?

108
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,801
Nah. Use this.

109
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:06,345
I'm sick of having to dry myself
with a newspaper.

110
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,847
You could at least do some laundry.

111
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,063
I pay the rent.

112
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,773
Dude, you know I'm good for it.

113
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,023
I'll have plenty of money
when my lawsuit pays off.

114
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,855
You mean the spider bite
at Disneyland?

115
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,071
Or the incident
with the over-salted fries.

116
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,242
(knock at door)

117
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,611
Hologram for Bart Simpson.

118
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,873
Hey, dingus, your band
can play at my club tonight.

119
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,123
Yes!

120
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,712
But I can only pay you
in popcorn shrimp.

121
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,291
Smell you later.

122
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,713
I can't believe "smell you later"

123
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,086
replaced "good-bye."

124
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,513
Smell you later.

125
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,051
-Smell you later.
-Smell you later.

126
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,844
All right, we got our first gig!

127
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,557
But you traded your amplifier
for a Boogie Board.

128
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,718
No prob. I'll just mooch
some green off my folks.

129
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,597
Should we take the hover bus
or the non-hover bus?

130
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,095
Non-hover.

131
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,070
(gulping)

132
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,570
Bleh! This virtual fudge
tastes like crap.

133
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:06,073
Mmm. Mmm. Not half as good
as cyber-fudge.

134
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,493
Yo, it's me.

135
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,750
(screams)

136
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,622
Oh, what a bleak,
horrible future we live in!

137
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,127
Don't you mean "present"?

138
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,289
Right, right, present.

139
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,247
Anyway, can I get you
some Soylent Green?

140
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,458
Isn't that made of people?

141
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,377
Oh, here we go.

142
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,506
Hey, Dad. My band finally got a break.

143
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,433
I just need a little moolah
to get my amp out of hock.

144
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,143
How about a little loan-ski?

145
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,853
Oh, I'm tired of giving you money.

146
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,984
Why can't you be more like Lisa?

147
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,481
Ugh. I am so sick of hearing about Lisa.

148
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,903
Just because she's doing
a little better than me...

149
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,282
She's President of the United States.

150
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,820
President-elect.

151
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,913
I could have been president,
but I'm too real.

152
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,658
People can't deal with
what I'm laying down.

153
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,830
They're like, "Whoa, dude,
you can't say that"

154
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,910
And I'm like, "Watch me."

155
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,703
We're not giving you money.

156
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,708
Oh, but I want some.

157
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,250
You should have thought of that

158
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,503
before you dropped out
of the DeVry Institute.

159
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,337
What happened to you, man?
You used to be cool.

160
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,335
I'm still cool.

161
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,756
Nah. You've changed, man.

162
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,925
Well, I do have this robotic prostate,

163
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,563
but you can't see it.

164
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
Oh, you can.

165
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,686
(ringing doorbell)

166
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,860
Flanders is a soft touch.

167
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,439
He'll give us the money for sure.

168
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,988
Jesus, is that you?

169
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,821
Mr. Flanders, you're blind-e-ded.

170
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:31,365
Ah, yeah, I never should have
had that trendy laser surgery.

171
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,621
(laughs) It was great at first,
but, you know,

172
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,913
at the ten-year mark your eyes fall out.

173
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,867
-Listen, dude...
-Oh, hi, Bart.

174
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,037
How much this time?

175
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,245
Dude, you got me all wrong.

176
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,995
Yeah. (scoffs)
Just answer me this.

177
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,507
Are you holding your mooching sack?

178
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,341
My little one.

179
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,014
Bart, you're never going to grow up

180
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,392
if I keep bailing you out.

181
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,509
Then, please, help me help myself.

182
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,217
Oh, all right,

183
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,097
but only because you haven't
outed Rod and Todd.

184
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,190
Hey, y'all ready to party?

185
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,735
(electrical crackling)

186
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,898
(loud feedback)

187
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,617
Now, we'd like to play
a Jimmy Buffet song,

188
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,408
but he un-coolly charges
people to cover them.

189
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,043
So here's a Captain Bart...

190
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,119
Original.

191
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,754
(strumming guitar)

192
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,670
<i>♪ Wasted once more ♪</i>

193
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,169
<i>♪ In Daquiritaville... ♪</i>

194
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,170
Rip-off!

195
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,051
Get off the stage!

196
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,298
(angry shouting)

197
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,010
(glass shattering)

198
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,680
We need more power.

199
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,589
The shield won't hold much longer.

200
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,477
Oh, no, I've got half a beer in there

201
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,186
and <i>Bewitched </i>is on.

202
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,986
Now we've got no home, no money

203
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,570
and our band's going nowhere

204
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,695
and it's all your fault.

205
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,242
Smell you later, Bart.

206
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,905
Smell you later forever.

207
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,213
Oh, he's right.

208
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,329
I'm a loser.

209
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:04,455
There's only one way out of this mess.

210
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,844
(electrical surging)

211
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,973
{\an8}From around the globe
to your frontal lobe,

212
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,009
{\an8}this is <i>Brain Vision News.</i>

213
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,933
{\an8}Tonight's winning lotto number:
4-4-6.

214
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,312
Damn! I was so close.

215
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,769
I had 3-2-7.

216
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,888
In other news,
President-elect Lisa Simpson

217
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,516
moves into
the White House tomorrow.

218
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,562
The 17-bedroom home
features free long-distance,

219
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,277
laundry service
and three food kitchens.

220
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,859
So, I'm the President's
no-good brother.

221
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,034
"Moochie-moochie."

222
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,909
Lisa's the President?

223
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,531
I'm a pathetic loser?

224
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,697
I got to be honest.

225
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,445
I'm not loving this vision.

226
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,787
The fire has more wisdom
to impart to you

227
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,293
in three, two...

228
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,550
1596...

229
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,799
1598...

230
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,599
1600.

231
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,925
Sweet.

232
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,265
Excellent question.

233
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,519
Yes, I am proud to be

234
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,401
America's first straight female president.

235
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,608
-(reporters chattering)
-Helen?

236
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,148
Wasn't I wearing a hat?

237
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,862
Yes. Yes, you were.

238
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,152
Now, in conclusion,

239
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,855
my administration will focus
on the three R's--

240
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,566
Reading, writing,
and refilling the ocean.

241
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,827
Thank you very much.

242
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,367
(shutter clicking)

243
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,460
As you know, we've inherited

244
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,790
quite a budget crunch
from President Trump.

245
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,956
How bad is it,
Secretary Van Houten?

246
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,418
We're broke.

247
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,335
The country is broke?

248
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,684
How can that be?

249
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,469
Well, remember when
the last administration decided

250
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,763
to invest in our nation's children?

251
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,217
Big mistake.

252
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,427
The balanced breakfast program
just created a generation

253
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,307
of ultra-strong super criminals.

254
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,524
And midnight basketball taught them

255
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,314
to function without sleep.

256
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,277
What about my pledge to build
the world's largest bookmobile?

257
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,069
Isn't there any money left for that?

258
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,912
No. And we borrowed
from every country in the world.

259
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,158
Quick, Lisa, call off your...
(screams and thuds)

260
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,870
-Bart!
-Ow! Watch the ponytail.

261
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,201
Let him up, please?

262
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,535
What are you doing here?

263
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,542
I knew you'd need some help
keeping it real

264
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:10,344
so I figured I could be,
like, your... co-president.

265
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,919
Co-president?

266
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,424
Are you crazy?

267
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,836
Mom, Lisa won't share!

268
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,005
Be nice to your brother, Lisa.

269
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,390
(groans)

270
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,721
(Homer chomping loudly)

271
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,387
Don't you think
we should wait for Lisa?

272
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,845
She is the President.

273
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,765
She knows what time dinner is.
(chomping)

274
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,904
("Hail To The Chief" playing)

275
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,282
Sorry I'm late.
I've been racking my brain

276
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,834
trying to think of something
to cut from the budget.

277
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,488
(whistling nonchalantly)

278
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,707
(all chomping)

279
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,998
Hey, where's Maggie?

280
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,288
Here she is...

281
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,245
And look how big she's gotten.

282
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,625
Aw, just like her mommy, Maggie Senior.

283
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,724
So, what did everyone do today?

284
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,140
Appointed a Supreme Court justice.

285
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,138
MARGE: Oh!

286
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,929
<i>-Bewitched </i>marathon.
-MARGE: Mmm.

287
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,432
Searched for Lincoln's gold.

288
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,024
Dad, that's just a myth.

289
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,599
Lincoln didn't hide any gold
in the White House.

290
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,895
Then what is
his ghost protecting?

291
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,939
Hey, that's my helicopter.

292
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,573
Yeah, I sent it to pick up Ralph,

293
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,610
no one was using it.

294
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,277
I fell out two times.

295
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:23,034
Bart, you do not send
a billion-dollar helicopter

296
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,737
to pick up your drinking buddy.

297
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,117
You've changed, Lisa,
you used to be cool.

298
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,294
No, I didn't.

299
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,542
I am proud to honor
the players of

300
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,134
the Negro Leagues of Rollerball

301
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,249
And as we strive

302
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,835
for the desegregation
of all death sports,

303
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,721
we cannot help but be inspired by...

304
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,008
-BART: Heads.
-(grunts)

305
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,726
Hey, you guys owe me
a Frisbee... a new one.

306
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,349
Bart, get out of here.

307
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,346
Relax, Lis, you'll live longer.

308
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,858
I can't relax.

309
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,819
Being president is hard work.

310
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,860
Maybe <i>you </i>should try doing
something with your life.

311
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,653
-I'm gonna.
-Yeah, did you even call

312
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,407
about that messenger job?

313
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,619
Yeah, but they said I wouldn't get

314
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,408
my first check for two weeks.

315
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,452
Meanwhile, they're making
major interest on <i>my </i>salary.

316
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,406
-Hey, maybe I could sue 'em.
-(sighs)

317
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,918
HOMER: Four score and four,

318
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,879
four score and five, four score and six,

319
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,669
four score and seven paces.
(grunts)

320
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,795
Wait! How do you know

321
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,722
this is where
Lincoln buried the gold?

322
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,721
You just started counting
from an arbitrary place.

323
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,894
I started what from a what?

324
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,271
Your plan makes no sense.

325
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,939
Gold bars discovered
by Marge-- Zero.

326
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,849
Gold bars discovered by Homer...

327
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,858
Well, let's just see.

328
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,110
-(grunts)
-Oops. Sorry, honey.

329
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,822
Gold bars discovered by Homer...

330
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,822
Shut up.

331
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,703
LISA: If I'm going to bail
the country out,

332
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,450
I'll have to raise taxes.

333
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,622
But in my speech, I'd like to avoid

334
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,370
calling it
a "painful emergency tax."

335
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:52,043
What about
"colossal salary grab"?

336
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,832
See, that has the same problem.

337
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,456
We need to soften the blow.

338
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,423
Well, if you just want
to out-and-out lie...

339
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,631
MILHOUSE: OK.

340
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,174
We could call it

341
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,468
a "temporary refund adjustment."

342
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,392
-I love it.
-Really?

343
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,350
What else do you love, Lisa?

344
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,770
Fiscal solvency.

345
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,809
Oh... Yeah. Me, too.

346
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,142
Thirty seconds, Madam President.

347
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,227
Hey, Lis, I need a favor.

348
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,731
Not now, Bart. I'm about
to speak to 100 million people.

349
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,074
This speech could make
or break my presidency.

350
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,989
I hear you.
All I want you to do

351
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,318
is play my demo tape in the background

352
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,903
while you're yakking
about whatever.

353
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,488
Now, this play button
is a little screwed up,

354
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,913
so you got to hold it down.

355
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,491
-Are you insane?
-What?

356
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,486
You told me I should
do something with my life.

357
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,698
Five seconds.

358
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,413
(loud crash)

359
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,537
Mom!

360
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,206
(clears throat)
My fellow Americans

361
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,304
and voting illegal aliens,

362
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,879
I will not mince words.

363
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,844
Your country needs you.

364
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,854
<i>That's why today I'm proposing</i>
<i>a temporary refund adjustment.</i>

365
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,928
"Refund"? Hey,
sounds good to me.

366
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,184
Sure beats a tax.

367
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,975
We love you, President Simpson.

368
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,598
The months ahead will be
long and arduous

369
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,606
But it is only
through arduousity that--

370
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,648

"The Pina Colada Song")

(laughs nervously)

376
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,237
Uh, this is my brother, Bart,

377
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,617
who doesn't seem to realize

378
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,833
this isn't the best
time for his music.

379
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,794
He's one of the people I want
to help with my programs.

380
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,134
Hey, Lis, my music is gonna
make it a lot easier

381
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,169
for America to swallow
your big tax hike.

382
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,843
-(gasps)
-"Tax hike"?

383
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,052
Hold the phone, Mabel.

384
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,471
You know, I never trusted her.

385
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,469
Don't blame me.

386
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,550
I voted for Chastity Bono.

387
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,506

Good night, America.

392
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,231
And we're out.

393
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,024
-Why you little...
-(choking)

394
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,937
Help! Secret service!

395
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,856
(gasping and choking)

396
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,450
According to polls,
Americans have emphatically said

397
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,704
"smell you later"

398
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,616
to President Simpson's
refund adjustment.

399
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,214
And that's the news.

400
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,039
We'll smell you later at 11:00.

401
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,880
Thanks a lot, Bart.

402
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,671
All right. How do we pay off
our foreign debt?

403
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,594
I'm afraid it looks pretty grim.

404
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,423
We're going to have to give them
the amber waves of grain,

405
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,548
the purple mountains' majesty
and the shores of Tripoli.

406
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,095
We don't own the shores of Tripoli.

407
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,468
Shh. By the time they find out

408
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,184
we'll have taken our cyanide pills.

409
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,434
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

410
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,186
Why don't we just invite
our creditor nations here

411
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,188
and gently remind them
of America's past generosity?

412
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,321
-(murmuring agreement)
-Yeah, now that I like.

413
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,109
Oh, but Bart
could screw everything up.

414
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,403
You want him eliminated?

415
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,896
No. Just keep him
out of my hair.

416
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,778
Out of your hair
with extreme severity?

417
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,414
-No.
-Come on. Every president

418
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,241
gets three secret murders.
If you don't use them

419
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,696
by the end of the term...
Pbft! They're gone.

420
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,656
(door opens)

421
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,745
All right, which one of you suits

422
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,000
ran over my moped?

423
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,751
I just put a dollar's worth
of gas in that thing.

424
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,133
Bart, we're having a meeting.

425
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,209
You had a meeting this morning.

426
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,633
I have a lot of meetings.
I'm the President.

427
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:49,133
Of what? The United States
of Dorksylvania? (snickers)

428
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,046
Don't leave me hanging, Greenspan.

429
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,675
You know something, Bart?

430
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,223
You're right. My lack of coolness

431
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,886
is really holding America back.

432
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,806
Thank you. Down low.

433
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,234
Too slow.

434
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,402
(laughs nervously)
You're too much, Bart.

435
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:08,071
That's why I'm appointing you
Secretary of Keeping It Real.

436
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,532
Wow. You're really asking
for my help?

437
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,662
Absolutely.

438
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,069
I want you and your pals

439
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,577
to go away to Camp David

440
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,738
and write up a report on coolness.

441
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,617
Well, if my country needs me...

442
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,615
Can we skinny dip?

443
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,786
At Camp David? Sure.

444
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,375
They couldn't keep pants on Kissinger.

445
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,839
Phew.

446
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,210
(clamoring)

447
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,587
-MAN: Peace, peace.
-BART: Settle down.

448
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,263
Settle down!

449
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,931
I invited you guys here
to help me with this report.

450
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,011
Any ideas?

451
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,965
Let's start off with a joke.

452
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,426
I got one. Give me that.

453
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,175
Uh, "What's the difference

454
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,937
between Pakistan and a pancake?

455
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,860
I don't know any pancakes
that were nuked by India."

456
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:46,939
Ha-ha.

457
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,487
What? Too soon?

458
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,488
Come on, people.
We got to buckle down here.

459
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,451
When we're finished,

460
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,820
we can go through
Bill Clinton's porno stash.

461
00:17:56,533 --> 00:18:00,253
{\an8}(all clamoring excitedly)

462
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,010
(sighs) Lisa's counting on me
for this coolness report.

463
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,049
-Coolness report?
-(gasps)

464
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,091
Huh! You been had, boy.

465
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,545
Billy Carter's ghost?

466
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,545
Damn straight,
and I'm here to tell you

467
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,557
you've been sent on a wild goose chase.

468
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,639
You mean Lisa wanted
to get rid of me?

469
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,064
Well, that's a big 10-4.

470
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,272
When my brother Jimmy was making
peace in the Middle East,

471
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,613
He sent me to
Belly Flop Academy.

472
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,571
-I guess I am an embarrassment.
-You sure are.

473
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,321
And, hey, there's
an embarrassment of riches

474
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,073
{\an8}at the Caesar's
Pow-Wow Indian Casino.

475
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,365
{\an8}You can bet on it.
(clicks tongue)

476
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,447
You put an ad in my vision?

477
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,656
Yeah, Crazy Talk came up with that.

478
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:46,166
He got idea from
Dances with Focus Groups.

479
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,590
(grunting)

480
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,469
Marge, I did it!
I found Lincoln's gold!

481
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,763
-(gasps)
-Huh?

482
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,141
"Dear countryman,

483
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,851
you have come in search
of my gold

484
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,271
-and I will not disappoint you."
-Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

485
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,400
"My gold is in the heart of
every freedom-loving American."

486
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,899
Aw, crap!

487
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,691
"It's in our mighty rivers,
our majestic..."

488
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,485
Well, isn't that clever?

489
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,109
It's a metaphor.

490
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:18,065
That lying, rail-splitting,

491
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,697
theater-going freak! (groans)

492
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,164
-Pay your debt!
-(speaks French)

493
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,204
We demand remittance.

494
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,117
Please! Calm down.

495
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,705
We can work something out.

496
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,250
(German accent) We Germans
are not a warlike people,

497
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,344
but even we have limits.

498
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,130
Right! Let's bash her noggin.

499
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,673
-Yeah, get her!
-That's the spirit!

500
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,836
BART: You guys should relax.

501
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,425
You'll live longer.

502
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,680
Bart, you're supposed
to be at Camp David.

503
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,256
You're meeting with debt collectors

504
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,557
and you don't want <i>my </i>help?

505
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,520
Do you know how crazy that is?

506
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,441
Guys, the thing is,
we totally have the money

507
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,270
and we tried to wire it to you,

508
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,315
but you know how banks screw up.

509
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,069
(French accent)
I do not understand.

510
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,861
We tried to call you all day Saturday.

511
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,654
We were there Saturday.

512
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,818
Dude, I know.

513
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,156
I left a message
with some guy named Hans.

514
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,371
Hans?

515
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,541
He might have been a temp.
Very surly.

516
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,460
We have had a lot of turnover.

517
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,288
You pay now. Now!

518
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,333
What happened to you, China.

519
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,587
You used to be cool.

520
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,208
Hey, China is still cool.

521
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,375
You pay later. Later!

522
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,803
Solid. The rest of you,

523
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,671
go on home and look
in your mailboxes,

524
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,838
'cause I totally remember
sending checks out.

525
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,637
(murmuring agreement
in different languages)

526
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,346
Thanks, Bart.

527
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,975
You bought us some time.

528
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,442
What can I do to thank you?

529
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,611
Legalize it.

530
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:33,689
Legalize what?

531
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,199
Oh. Oh, consider it done.

532
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,568
Tasty. That calls for some tune-skis.

533
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,237
(pop rock music playing)

534
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,325
-(warped music)
-Oh, great.

535
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,330
Anyone have a paper clip?

536
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,455
It gets kind of hazy after that.

537
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,212
Why did a vision of <i>my </i>future

538
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,634
include a story about
Homer and Lincoln's gold?

539
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,973
I guess the spirits thought

540
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,168
the main vision was a little thin.

541
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,628
Anyway, the point is

542
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,007
you still have the power
to change your future.

543
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,345
I'll do my best.

544
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,679
You're a good kid.

545
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,644
Here's a coupon for some crab claws.

546
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,811
Hey, this is expired.

547
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,520
There you are.

548
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,436
Come on. We have to go.

549
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:20,235
Dad pushed a waitress,
and Mom lost $20,000.

550
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,284
You're not going to believe it, Lis.

551
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,576
This cool Indian guy
showed me our future.

552
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,160
Really? Anything good?

553
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,995
I'll say. I've got my own band

554
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,000
and a moped.

555
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,001
What about me?

556
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,082
Eh, some government job.

557
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,762
(theme music playing)

558
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:20,875
Shh!

559
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,054
BART: <i>Moochie-moochie.</i>

560
