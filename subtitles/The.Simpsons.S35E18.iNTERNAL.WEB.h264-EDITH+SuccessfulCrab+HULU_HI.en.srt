00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:03,299
- [cheering] - Yay!
- All right!

181
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:04,702
Then let's give the old liver

182
00:08:04,802 --> 00:08:06,907
one last night
he'll never forget.

183
00:08:07,007 --> 00:08:08,142
Set 'em up, Moe.

184
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:09,813
[chanting]
One last night!

185
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,416
- One last night!
- [Barney exclaims]

186
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,754
[upbeat video game music
playing]

187
00:08:14,923 --> 00:08:17,193
[video game announcer]
Atomic wedgie!

188
00:08:21,703 --> 00:08:24,543
Oh, it feels so good
to get out of the house

189
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,914
and away from
that stupid needy brain.

190
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,182
Am I right?

191
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:29,786
I'm enjoying being a Dad.

192
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:32,659
I can fix the mistakes
my parents made with me.

193
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,996
[video game announcer]
Player two loses.

194
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:35,898
[frustrated shout]

195
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:38,436
I'm a failure because of you!

196
00:08:38,537 --> 00:08:40,173
[video game announcer]
Bonus humiliation.

197
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,243
Defile him.

198
00:08:44,783 --> 00:08:46,987
Aw, kind of reminds me
of my little guy.

199
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:49,526
Uh... [stammers]
not that I care or anything.

200
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:52,097
Boys, I made you
a healthy snack,

201
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,769
roasted cauliflower.

202
00:08:56,673 --> 00:08:58,042
[Bart]
Aw, look at him there.

203
00:08:58,142 --> 00:09:00,447
So cute on that plate.

204
00:09:00,514 --> 00:09:02,685
Maybe I should get home.

205
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:06,125
Sweet.
More roastie-collies for me.

206
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:13,406
Oh, where is Dad with my brain?
They should be home by now.

207
00:09:13,473 --> 00:09:14,475
[car door closes outside]

208
00:09:14,543 --> 00:09:16,445
Ugh, finally.

209
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:18,450
It's about time,
you good-for-nothing!

210
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:20,588
Relax, Marge.

211
00:09:20,688 --> 00:09:22,759
The baby's fine.

212
00:09:22,826 --> 00:09:24,462
Oh, there you are.

213
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:26,132
Oh, my sweet little precious...

214
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,737
- [screams] Pickled eggs!
- [glass shatters]

215
00:09:28,804 --> 00:09:30,374
Where's my brain?!

216
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,177
Oh, must've gotten mixed up.

217
00:09:32,244 --> 00:09:33,313
Two jars.

218
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:35,317
[chuckles]
We were making 'em kiss.

219
00:09:35,383 --> 00:09:36,787
He's too young for kissing.

220
00:09:36,853 --> 00:09:38,990
I got to go find him.

221
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:42,364
What happened to that brain
my dad had?

222
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,502
Well, years of drinking,

223
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:46,305
not to mention
all that nuclear stuff,

224
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:49,378
and, uh, I don't think it was
all that great to begin with.

225
00:09:49,478 --> 00:09:51,717
The one in the jar.

226
00:09:51,783 --> 00:09:52,918
Oh, that. Oh. [chuckles]

227
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:55,490
I left that in the alley
for the raccoons.

228
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:57,460
They'll eat tonight. [chuckles]

229
00:09:57,528 --> 00:09:59,297
- [gasps] No!
- [raccoons chittering]

230
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,402
[whimpers]

231
00:10:01,503 --> 00:10:03,105
[sighs]

232
00:10:03,172 --> 00:10:04,375
Huh?

233
00:10:04,475 --> 00:10:07,347
Nicotine beef jerky?

234
00:10:07,414 --> 00:10:09,017
I know who took you.

235
00:10:09,118 --> 00:10:11,355
[chewing noisily]

236
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,762
I'm so jerked-up.

237
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:17,535
I feel like
I smoked a whole cow.

238
00:10:17,602 --> 00:10:19,805
Let's mess up this brain.

239
00:10:20,608 --> 00:10:21,577
[Bart]
Leave it alone!

240
00:10:21,677 --> 00:10:22,812
That's my brain!

241
00:10:22,912 --> 00:10:23,914
After we blow it up,

242
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:25,551
you can have the biggest chunk.

243
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:26,920
This isn't some frog

244
00:10:26,987 --> 00:10:29,325
where you can put a firecracker
in its butt.

245
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:30,761
It's a living thing,

246
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:32,732
and it's my job
to take care of it

247
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,236
and teach it to do
cool stuff like, um,

248
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:38,644
paintball and-and
pooping in jack-o'-lanterns.

249
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,181
So hands off my brain!

250
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:42,651
Okay, okay.

251
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:45,356
You can have
your stupid head cheese.

252
00:10:45,423 --> 00:10:47,928
Don't worry.
I'm taking you home.

253
00:10:48,764 --> 00:10:51,904
I wonder if
anyone will ever love me

254
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,743
the way he loves that brain.

255
00:10:54,843 --> 00:10:56,947
Look, man, I'm gonna
take better care of you.

256
00:10:57,014 --> 00:10:58,617
You're the only brain I've got.

257
00:10:58,717 --> 00:11:00,120
You need a name, bud.

258
00:11:00,186 --> 00:11:01,690
Wait. Buddy.

259
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:04,094
Perfect! 'Cause you're my buddy.

260
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:07,868
Also I don't want to think
about this any harder.

261
00:11:10,106 --> 00:11:12,110
[Bart]
Thursday, May 14th.

262
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,414
Buddy and I had
quite the adventure tonight.

263
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:17,555
I realized he's more than
just some dumb prank

264
00:11:17,621 --> 00:11:19,224
or a homework assignment.

265
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:21,729
He's a badass like me.

266
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:26,172
- [fingers snap]
- Garçon!

267
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:28,743
Another high chair
for my associate here.

268
00:11:31,082 --> 00:11:34,020
[groans]
You brought your jar friend.

269
00:11:34,054 --> 00:11:36,292
Oh, I get it.
Buddy's a little different.

270
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:37,962
But he's my responsibility.

271
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:39,800
Plus he's pretty cool.

272
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,540
Well, uh, maybe he can be
under the table.

273
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:45,744
Whoa! Buddy's my plus-one.

274
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:47,949
Would you rather me
bring Milhouse?

275
00:11:48,016 --> 00:11:50,854
No, no, no, no, no.
No one said Milhouse.

276
00:11:50,921 --> 00:11:52,658
Simpsons, a-welcome.

277
00:11:52,725 --> 00:11:54,896
Oh, my favorite a-family.

278
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:57,267
A-Homer, a-Marge, a-Lisa,

279
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:00,106
a-Maggie, a-Bart, a-brain.

280
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:01,408
A-brain?!

281
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,916
[praying in Latin]

282
00:12:04,982 --> 00:12:06,619
It's okay, it's okay.

283
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:08,289
It's just a school project.

284
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:10,928
Good a-news.
A table, she just open up

285
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:12,765
in a-private dining room.

286
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:15,269
[winded]
You can... go into...

287
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:17,040
[panting]

288
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,347
My pasta's cold.

289
00:12:20,414 --> 00:12:22,216
Everything's cold!

290
00:12:24,388 --> 00:12:27,862
Ugh, this brain business
will not be good for Bart

291
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:29,331
if he keeps it up.

292
00:12:29,431 --> 00:12:32,470
Oh, come on, think of all the
worse stuff he could be doing.

293
00:12:32,538 --> 00:12:34,108
Or all the worse stuff
he's done.

294
00:12:34,174 --> 00:12:35,343
He named it!

295
00:12:35,443 --> 00:12:38,082
And I think he gave it
a bite of tiramisu.

296
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:40,655
[sighs]
This is different for Bart.

297
00:12:40,755 --> 00:12:43,994
What if he becomes
the town weirdo?

298
00:12:44,094 --> 00:12:45,964
Oh, weirdos aren't
what they used to be.

299
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:49,605
They start computer companies
or own the Las Vegas Raiders.

300
00:12:49,672 --> 00:12:51,342
Or become serial killers.

301
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:54,716
But still, his odds are
at least two out of three.

302
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,319
Children label each other.

303
00:12:56,419 --> 00:13:00,293
Bart's in danger of becoming
"The Brain Boy."

304
00:13:00,393 --> 00:13:01,462
You worry too much.

305
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:03,700
Remember when you thought
Lisa was going to hell

306
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,604
because she was a vegetarian?

307
00:13:05,704 --> 00:13:07,073
I still think that.

308
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,979
Excellent work
on your egg projects, class.

309
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,520
And your parenting journals
were really inspired.

310
00:13:13,587 --> 00:13:15,858
An A-plus? I can't believe it.

311
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:16,993
I've never gotten one of those.

312
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,966
I thought those were just
for suck-wads like Martin.

313
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,638
Okay, everybody,
you did a great job,

314
00:13:22,705 --> 00:13:25,110
so it's time
to turn in your eggs.

315
00:13:25,176 --> 00:13:27,815
Whoa, hold on there.
I am not giving you Buddy.

316
00:13:27,915 --> 00:13:30,219
Well, one of the hardest parts
of parenting

317
00:13:30,253 --> 00:13:32,559
is watching your child move on.

318
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,428
To be Willy's breakfast.

319
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:36,799
[laughing]

320
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:38,570
Your brain can have a home

321
00:13:38,704 --> 00:13:40,741
on a shelf
in the school science lab.

322
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:42,979
[grunts] Buddy hates science.

323
00:13:43,046 --> 00:13:45,216
He's like me.
He's into MeatCanyon videos

324
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,719
and doing wrestling moves
on the dog

325
00:13:46,786 --> 00:13:48,524
and pouring Red Bull
on pancakes!

326
00:13:48,624 --> 00:13:50,795
Bart, it might be healthy
for you

327
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:53,065
to take a break from Buddy.

328
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,902
And it might be healthy for you
to have your own kid

329
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,607
and not live through us!

330
00:13:57,407 --> 00:14:01,750
I never should've told you
that we were trying!

331
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,321
Don't you worry. It'll work out.

332
00:14:04,388 --> 00:14:06,859
It's only been three months.
Give it time.

333
00:14:11,503 --> 00:14:12,639
Ah, wifeless shopping,

334
00:14:12,739 --> 00:14:15,009
where all the meat is nuggets

335
00:14:15,076 --> 00:14:17,782
and the produce section
doesn't exist.

336
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:19,117
Ooh, the candy aisle.

337
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:21,054
Formerly known as cereal.

338
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:23,325
[humming happily]

339
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,635
I don't care if he is
Milhouse's best friend.

340
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:29,304
He's just weird.

341
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:31,876
And not the kind
with "a diagnosis"

342
00:14:31,976 --> 00:14:33,345
that we have to like now.

343
00:14:33,445 --> 00:14:36,084
My JJ says that he talks
to the brain

344
00:14:36,184 --> 00:14:37,721
when no one's looking.

345
00:14:37,755 --> 00:14:39,191
My little Seymour says the kids

346
00:14:39,258 --> 00:14:42,431
all call him "Brain Boy"
behind his back.

347
00:14:42,497 --> 00:14:45,771
Hmm. I wonder
who they're talking about.

348
00:14:45,871 --> 00:14:46,906
Moleman?

349
00:14:47,006 --> 00:14:48,442
Well, whatever
they're calling him,

350
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,348
I don't want Bart Simpson
around my son.

351
00:14:55,524 --> 00:14:59,231
No surprise to me that Bart
Simpson has become a weirdo.

352
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,402
[whispering]
When I had him in second grade,

353
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:02,939
he ate a booger.

354
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:05,043
I hear Bart shares his bed
with that brain.

355
00:15:05,143 --> 00:15:06,947
Puts a little sleep mask on it.

356
00:15:07,013 --> 00:15:08,449
It's my fault, girls.

357
00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:12,057
I should've noogied him more,
knuckled some sense into him.

358
00:15:12,157 --> 00:15:16,666
He had potential, but I guess
he's just the town freak now.

359
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:18,435
[sadly]
Haw-haw.

360
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:20,540
[humming a tune]

361
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,951
[panting] Marge, you were right.

362
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,690
Everyone in the store
is calling Bart "Brain Boy."

363
00:15:28,757 --> 00:15:30,359
It's already started
with the yentas.

364
00:15:30,392 --> 00:15:33,266
It won't be long before
it spreads to the slaggards!

365
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,336
That's the whole rest
of the town!

366
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:36,338
Bart is lost.

367
00:15:36,506 --> 00:15:39,010
He won't be known by his name
but by his thing.

368
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:41,883
Like Comic Book Guy
or Crazy Cat Lady

369
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,421
or Professor Pocket Pool.

370
00:15:44,522 --> 00:15:46,893
Mmm. Mmm.

371
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:49,064
At least that professor
has lifetime tenure.

372
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:51,068
Bart's gonna be unemployable.

373
00:15:51,135 --> 00:15:53,740
Mom, Dad, I think
I have a suggestion.

374
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,310
[screams]
Little Miss Know-It-All!

375
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,848
I watched
this nature documentary

376
00:15:57,948 --> 00:15:59,384
that may apply to us.

377
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:01,757
When a chimp
starts acting strangely,

378
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:03,894
if it doesn't stop the behavior,

379
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:06,164
the tribe will
savagely attack it,

380
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:09,437
leaving it scarred
and isolated forever.

381
00:16:09,505 --> 00:16:10,473
I knew it.

382
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,145
We need to protect
my special little chimp

383
00:16:13,245 --> 00:16:16,786
from the cruel people
in this town who would shun him.

384
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:22,330
Yes, we must be the loving
parents who keep him locked up.

385
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:25,871
[Marge hushed]
Open the door quietly.

386
00:16:25,937 --> 00:16:27,608
[whispering]
You know how squeaky it is.

387
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,144
I told you to oil it.

388
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,781
I'm not an architect.

389
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:33,085
Your stage whispers
are too loud.

390
00:16:33,152 --> 00:16:34,789
Where are you guys going?

391
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:37,060
Bart! We, um...

392
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,763
We're going to church.

393
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,132
Why didn't you wake me up?

394
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,703
Uh, you hate church.

395
00:16:41,803 --> 00:16:45,610
The itchy pants, the big book
of stuff that never happened.

396
00:16:45,677 --> 00:16:48,382
We thought maybe you'd like
to skip it this week.

397
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:49,619
As a reward.

398
00:16:49,652 --> 00:16:51,856
Uh, for being so normal.

399
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:52,858
[Homer chuckles nervously]

400
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:54,327
This is about Buddy, isn't it?

401
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:56,298
You're ashamed
to be seen with me.

402
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:58,102
- Of course not.
- No!

403
00:16:58,202 --> 00:17:01,776
Why would we be ashamed
of our son and his BFF,

404
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:04,147
a jar of human remains?

405
00:17:04,214 --> 00:17:06,051
Look, sweetie,
why don't you just

406
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:08,523
make yourself
some Red Bull pancakes,

407
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,926
put on cartoons,

408
00:17:09,993 --> 00:17:12,163
and we'll be back
before you know it.

409
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,533
Go. Go, go, go, go.

410
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:14,668
[door closes]

411
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:20,447
"...two oxen, five he-goats,

412
00:17:20,514 --> 00:17:23,953
"five lambs
of the first year, this..."

413
00:17:24,053 --> 00:17:25,356
[quietly]
It's so boring.

414
00:17:25,456 --> 00:17:28,897
But finally some peace
away from Brain Boy.

415
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,235
I hate to say this,
but you're right.

416
00:17:31,302 --> 00:17:34,808
My jaw is unclenched
for the first time in weeks.

417
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:37,815
[sighing heavily]

418
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:39,552
[Bart]
Sorry I'm late, everyone!

419
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:41,221
- Good to see ya.
- [congregation gasps]

420
00:17:41,254 --> 00:17:44,662
Don't mind us. Just gonna sit
with my loving family.

421
00:17:44,728 --> 00:17:46,165
That's the Brain Boy.

422
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,204
It's so gross and wrinkled.

423
00:17:49,304 --> 00:17:52,043
Don't look at him, JJ.

424
00:17:52,076 --> 00:17:54,181
Bart is troubled. Mmm.

425
00:17:54,248 --> 00:17:56,620
So, what episode of Jesus
are we on today?

426
00:17:56,686 --> 00:17:58,924
Is he still talking about
not judging people?

427
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:00,392
You know, loving your brother?

428
00:18:00,493 --> 00:18:02,732
- Or your son?
- [congregation groaning]

429
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,735
Ugh, Bart, stop it!

430
00:18:04,802 --> 00:18:05,938
This is enough!

431
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:07,541
Yeah, this isn't just
some little quirk

432
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:10,146
like wearing a fedora
or being a Libertarian.

433
00:18:10,212 --> 00:18:12,718
You got a disgusting brain
in a greasy jar.

434
00:18:12,818 --> 00:18:14,053
[scoffs] My family.

435
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,026
You're the ones who always said
you'd love me no matter what.

436
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:18,362
Unconditionally!

437
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:21,468
This was
an unforeseen condition!

438
00:18:23,405 --> 00:18:26,579
[gasps] Oh, wait.
I didn't mean that.

439
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:27,882
Too late, Mom.

440
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,253
Yes, I have a brain in a jar.
So what?

441
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,123
Sideshow Mel has
a human bone in his hair

442
00:18:32,189 --> 00:18:34,027
and nobody talks about that.

443
00:18:34,061 --> 00:18:37,000
For your information, weirdo,

444
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:40,439
this is the femur of a kangaroo!

445
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,114
It was given to me
by Yahoo Serious!

446
00:18:44,181 --> 00:18:46,018
Go ahead, laugh and point at me.

447
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:48,422
Call me Brain Boy. I don't care.

448
00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:50,460
I have a friend
who will never judge me,

449
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:52,531
who's always been there for me:

450
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:53,567
this brain!

451
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:56,071
He gets me,
'cause we're one in the same:

452
00:18:56,171 --> 00:18:58,743
badasses who don't play
by society's rules.

453
00:18:58,844 --> 00:19:00,179
We're the Bartmen.

454
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:02,551
Me and my best pal!

455
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,024
Corbin Everly?

456
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:08,028
Who's Corbin Everly?

457
00:19:08,095 --> 00:19:09,464
Hold on.

458
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,803
He was a local tax accountant

459
00:19:11,903 --> 00:19:13,874
who donated his body to science

460
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,346
hoping it could benefit
the world after his passing.

461
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,186
So Buddy's nothing like me?

462
00:19:20,286 --> 00:19:22,390
He's not some rude, crude,
prankin' dude

463
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,160
with the freaky fresh 'tude?

464
00:19:24,227 --> 00:19:27,701
He was just some guy
named Corbin?

465
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:31,676
Oh, maybe I shouldn't have been
sloshing him all over town.

466
00:19:31,742 --> 00:19:34,682
Mm. I feel bad for Bart.

467
00:19:34,748 --> 00:19:38,556
No boy wants his brain
to turn out to be a nerd.

468
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,796
Mom, I don't think I want to be
the Brain Boy anymore.

469
00:19:41,896 --> 00:19:44,033
Oh, sweetie.

470
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,211
I'm sorry we weren't more
supportive during this phase.

471
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:52,116
