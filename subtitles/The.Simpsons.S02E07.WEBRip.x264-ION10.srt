00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,283
Well, it's taking up
valuable real estate.

171
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,742
-Hey, Bart, stop it!
-Move it or lose it, Toots.

172
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,452
-Mom!
-Now just a minute.

173
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,833
I'm sure there's room for both.

174
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,749
(straining)

175
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,288
Bart, you're wrecking it!

176
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,462
Let go!
I worked forever on this!

177
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,500
Ooh.

178
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,756
(screaming)

179
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,721
-Hey, that got her going.
-Bitchin'.

180
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,219
Bart!

181
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,476
You don't even care!
You don't even care!

182
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,864
(crying)

183
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,441
-(door slams)
-All right, Bart,

184
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,186
That's it!
Go to your room! Now!

185
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,198
Okay. I'll take some
white meat and stuffing to go.

186
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,030
And send up the pumpkin pie
in about 20 minutes.

187
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,656
-I said, now!
-Mom, do I have to?

188
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,203
Yes, you do.

189
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,207
I hope you're happy, Bart!

190
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,289
You've ruined Thanksgiving!

191
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,549
BART: I didn't ruin
Thanksgiving, she did. (mutters)

192
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,472
I always get blamed
for everything.

193
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:57,261
And Lord, we're especially
thankful for nuclear power--

194
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,966
the cleanest, safest
energy source there is

195
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,477
except for solar,
which is just a pipe dream.

196
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,310
Anyway, we'd like to thank you
for the occasional moments

197
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,187
of peace and love
our family's experienced.

198
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,324
Well, not today.

199
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,241
Well, you saw what happened.
Oh, Lord, be honest.

200
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:17,281
Are we the most pathetic family
in the universe or what?

201
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,366
ALL: Amen.

202
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,542
Worst prayer yet.

203
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,830
(saxophone playing)

204
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,503
D'oh!

205
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,542
Why don't I go talk
to the children?

206
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,667
Don't worry.
Marge'll fix everything.

207
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,545
(saxophone continues)

208
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,143
Honey, your food
is getting cold.

209
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,932
(sniffling)

210
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,676
That's all right.

211
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,768
Lisa, I'm very sorry
about what happened.

212
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,404
Mom, I poured my heart
into that centerpiece.

213
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,032
Things like that
always happen in this family.

214
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,188
I've noticed that too.

215
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,947
Well, when you feel
like coming down,

216
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:59,029
-we'll be there.
-(keys clacking)

217
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:02,116
(playing saxophone)

218
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,004
Bart, you can
come down to dinner

219
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,832
as soon as you're ready
to apologize to your sister,

220
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,798
and it's going to be a real
apology in front of everybody,

221
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,049
and you have to mean it.

222
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,680
Apologize? For what?

223
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,298
Clearing the table?
Having a sense of humor?

224
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,506
They think they can starve
an apology out of me? Ha!

225
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,100
Uh-oh.

226
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,846
I mean... good!

227
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,938
(grunting)

228
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,193
HOMER: Hey,
what are you doing?

229
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,534
No! Drop that drumstick.

230
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,740
-Bad dog.
-(dog snarling)

231
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,150
Bad Santa's Little Helper.

232
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,908
Come on, give me that.
Give-- Give me that. D'oh!

233
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,740
Okay, out you go!

234
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,286
-(whimpering)
-Hey, boy, come here.

235
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,870
You're a good dog.
Come on.

236
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,706
We don't need them to
get a Thanksgiving dinner.

237
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,297
(barking)

238
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,717
(dog barks)

239
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,302
Wow! Swanky!

240
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,393
Mmm, delicious.

241
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,016
Smithers, every year
you outstrip yourself

242
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,484
in succulence.

243
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,654
Oh, thank you, sir.

244
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,192
Oh! Would you like
some candied yams?

245
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,065
Oh, no, I couldn't eat
another bite.

246
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,113
Dispose of all this.
I did however,

247
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,986
save room for your
special pumpkin pie.

248
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,204
It's cooling
on the windowsill, sir.

249
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,285
Mmm.

250
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,660
Stay here, boy.

251
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,038
(whimpering)

252
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,760
-(alarm beeping)
-Uh-oh.

253
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,511
(alarm sounding)

254
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:48,183
-(camera whirring)
-(alarm beeping)

255
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,267
Mr. Burns,
this is base command.

256
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,442
<i>The intruder appears</i>
<i>to be a young male, age 9 to 11.</i>

257
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,732
Release the hounds.

258
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:58,105
(barking, snarling)

259
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,574
(gasps)

260
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,323
Ahh!

261
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,695
(panicked grunting)

262
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:13,458
"I saw the best meals

263
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:17,342

"my soul carved in slices

266
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,683
(whimpering)

267
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,684
Don't worry, boy.
We'll get some grub,

268
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,346
even if we have
to pay for it.

269
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,983
-(stomach growling)
-(dog growling)

270
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,645

00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,826
Cool! The wrong side
of the tracks!

275
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,286
(police chatter on radio)

276
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,594
Twelve bucks?
Hey, I can bleed.

277
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,588
WOMAN: Hey, you've got
to be 18 to sell your blood.

278
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,125
Let's see some I.D.

279
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,178
BART:
Here you go, dollface.

280
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,812
-WOMAN: Okay, Homer, just relax.
-BART: Ow!

281
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,430
At the risk of
losing my voice,

282
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,268
let me just say
one more thing.

283
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,614
I'm sorry I came.

284
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,280
When is that boy
going to apologize?

285
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,778
He sure is stubborn.

286
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,990
Homer was never stubborn.

287
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,990
He always folded instantly
over anything.

288
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,993
It was as if he had
no will of his own.

289
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,196
Isn't that true, Homer?

290
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,826
Yes, Dad.

291
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,961
Twelve bucks and a free cookie.
What a country.

292
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,386
Cute little guy.

293
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,773
He's starting
to come around.

294
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,101
You look a little pale, son.

295
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,765
We better get you
some food.

296
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,145
Here we are.

297
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,402
(cheerful music playing)

298
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,701
All right!

299
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,452
Twelve big ones
and free grub to boot.

300
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,124
Viva, skid row!

301
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,962
{\an8}Hey! It's that anchor dude
from Channel Six.

302
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,459
Oh, yeah.
He's doing one of those

303
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,250
"Be thankful
for what you got" stories.

304
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,714
ANCHOR: Oh, we have lots
of names for these people--

305
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:26,335
bums, deadbeats, losers,
scums of the Earth.

306
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,085
We'd like to sweep
these people into the gutter,

307
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,927
or, if they're already
in the gutter,

308
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,762
to some other
out-of-the-way place.

309
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,767
Oh, we have our reasons.

310
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,100
They're depressing.
They wear ragged clothes.

311
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,645
They're "crazy."

312
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,559
-They smell bad.
-Hey, listen, man...

313
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,398
Wait. I'm going somewhere
with this.

314
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:46,323
So, every year on one lone,
conscience-salving day

315
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:50,573
we toss these people a bone--
a turkey bone--

316
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,738
and that's supposed
to make it all better.

317
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,446
<i>No, you won't find</i>
<i>Freddy the Freeloader</i>

318
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,917
<i>or Emmett Kelly</i>
<i>or even Charlie Chaplin's</i>

<i>beloved Little Tramp</i>
<i>down here...</i>

320
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,883
Pompous, blow-dried
college boy.

321
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,711
You know, his girlfriend
is the weather lady.

322
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,467
You don't say?

323
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,758
Everyone, Lisa wants to
read us a poem she's written.

324
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,933
-Sounds interesting.
-Okay.

325
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,103
"Howl of the Unappreciated"

326
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:18,022
by Lisa Simpson. Ahem.

327
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,772
I saw the best meal...

328
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,443
-(gasping) It's Bart!
-What show is this?

329
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,733
KENT: <i>And how long have you</i>
<i>been on the streets?</i>

330
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,147
<i>-Going on five years, Kent.</i>
<i>-Hmm.</i>

331
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,065
KENT: <i>Son, your family</i>

332
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,613
<i>Is there anything</i>
<i>you'd like to say to them?</i>

333
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,157
<i>Yes, there is, Kent.</i>

334
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,080
<i>Ha-ha! I didn't apologize!</i>

335
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,948
Oh, no!
My sweet, little Bart.

336
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,957
Hello, operator?
Give me the number for 911.

337
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,627
Hey, thanks for your help,
fellas.

338
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,803
This reporter smells
another local Emmy.

339
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,932
Yeah, we're rooting
for you, guy.

340
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,640
Hey, you got someplace
to sleep tonight, Bart?

341
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,811
Yeah, there's this family
I kinda hang out with.

342
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,560
-Sounds pretty sweet.
-Yeah, I guess it is.

343
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,564
See you at Christmas.

344
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,742
Listen, guys,
I was thinking, um,

345
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,741
unless you feel weird about
taking money from a kid

346
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,164
I thought maybe...

347
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,162
I wouldn't feel weird,
would you?

348
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,044
No, I'm comfortable
with it.

349
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,997
Will you forget
the report?

350
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,134
He's down at
the rescue mission.

351
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,671
Nah, we checked.
He's long gone.

352
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,165
Can you think of any reason
he might have run away?

353
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,546
Anything at all?

354
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,472
Well, we did
kind of yell at him

355
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,222
and sent him to his room

356
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,854
and tried to force him
to apologize to his sister.

357
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,732
-Uh-huh.
-MARGE: And...

358
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,059
I said
he ruined Thanksgiving.

359
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,105
Oh, I see.

360
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,694
Best Thanksgiving ever,
eh, boy?

361
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,489
Good-bye.

362
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,622
Sorry. I'm sure Bart
will be back.

363
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,658
I would say something
comforting,

364
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,082
but, you know, my voice.

365
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,161
Let's go! If I'm not back
at the home by nine,

366
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,787
they declare me
legally dead

367
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,714
and collect my insurance.

368
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,213
Homer, this is a terrible thing
that's happened.

369
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,916
but we can't blame
ourselves.

370
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,626
-We can and will.
-Children need discipline.

371
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,137
You can ask any syndicated
advice columnist.

372
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,930
Marge, are we ever
gonna see him again?

373
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,731
Hmm, should I or shouldn't I?

374
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,194
Hey everybody, I'm home.

375
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,243
Bart, you're home!
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

376
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,198
Oh, my special little guy.
Mwah!

377
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,529
We were so worried.

378
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,074
Oh, it's great
to have you back, boy.

379
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,867
We were afraid
we'd lost you.

380
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,161
Welcome back, Bart.

381
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,745
I'm sorry we had
such a terrible fight.

382
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,871
Bart, isn't there something

383
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,668
you'd like to say
to your sister?

384
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,051
Okay. I'm sorry too.

385
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,629
No, no, no,
that won't do at all.

386
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:56,514
Yeah, boy. Get down on your knees
and beg for forgiveness!

387
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,303
Yeah, beg me, Bart.
Beg me!

388
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,518
Lisa, I beg of you,
please, forgive me.

389
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:08,269
(evil laughter)

390
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,765
MARGE: Now we can blame him
for everything!

391
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,108
-It's your fault I'm bald!
-I'm sorry.

392
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,613
-It's your fault I'm old!
-I'm sorry.

393
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,736
-It's your fault I can't talk!
-I'm sorry.

394
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,994
It's your fault America
has lost its way.

395
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,036
-I'm sorry.
-It's all your fault!

396
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,580
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

397
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,964
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

398
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,882
I'm sorry, all right--
sorry I came back here.

399
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,882
Aha!

400
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,177
(grunting)

401
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,386
Whoa! My wiffle balls!

402
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,475
My frisbees!
My water rockets!

403
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,981
(gasps)
I've hit the jackpot!

404
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,483
A sell-out crowd
at the Super Bowl,

405
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,565
Simpson down by six
with two seconds left.

406
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,690
Simpson fades back.
He's got Simpson in the open.

407
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,953
Touchdown Simpson!
(mimics stadium cheers)

408
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,163
The boy nobody wanted
just won the Super Bowl!

409
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,414
(imitating crowd cheering )

410
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:13,673
Dear log, my brother
is still missing

411
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,924
and maybe it's my fault

412
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,876
because I failed
to take his abuse

413
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,756
with good humor.

414
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:24,183
I miss him so much already
that I don't know...

415
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,347
(Lisa sobbing)

416
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,935
(whispering)
Hey, Lise. Lisa.

417
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,810
It's me, Bart.

418
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,187
(sniffles)
Bart, where are you?

419
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,485
Shh. I'm on the roof.

420
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,816
(grunting)

421
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,328
Bart, what are you
doing up here?

422
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,371
Everybody's worried.

423
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,464
-Really? Did they cry?
-Yes.

424
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,169
Whoa, bull's-eye.

425
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,340
Bart, why did you burn
my centerpiece?

426
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,168
Aw, come on.

427
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,884
Was it because you hate me

428
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,514
-or because you're bad?
-I don't know.

429
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,801
I don't know why I did it.

430
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,394
I don't know why I enjoyed it.

431
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,009
And I don't know why
I'll do it again.

432
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,636
-Just tell me you're sorry.
-Why should I?

433
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,523
Bart, the only reason
to apologize

434
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,351
is if you look deep down
inside yourself

435
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,516
and you find a spot.

436
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,815
Something you wish
wasn't there.

437
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:19,649
Because you feel bad you
hurt your sister's feelings.

438
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,156
-Leave me alone.
-Just look!

439
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,989
Okay, okay.

440
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,245
(muttering)
Looking for the spot.

441
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,408
Still checking.
This is so stupid.

442
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,367
I'm not going
to find anything.

443
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,287
Just because I wrecked something
she worked really hard on

444
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,916
and I made her cr--

445
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,014
Uh-oh.

446
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,842
I'm sorry, Lisa.

447
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,966
Apology accepted.

448
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,144
You know, Marge,
we're great parents.

449
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,977
Oh Lord, on this blessed day,
we thank thee

450
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,784
for giving our family
one more crack at togetherness.

451
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,989
ALL: Amen.

452
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:03,158
