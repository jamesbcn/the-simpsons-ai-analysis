1
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,533
D'oh!

2
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,054
Did you unscrew all the Phillips heads?
- Check.

3
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:33,084
Did you unscrew all the flat-heads?
- Yep. And now we wait.

4
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,349
Now go hide the evidence
while I walk around saying,

5
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,510
'What happened?
Who would do such a thing?'

6
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,125
I'll return these to the shop room.
What's left of it.

7
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,864
Skinner!

8
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,067
Don't tell him I'm here.
- I know you're there, Skinner.

9
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,469
I'd recognize those discolored
Hush Puppies anywhere.

10
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:24,300
Hear that? He thinks my Try 'N Save brand
Shush Mutts are genuine Hush Puppies.

11
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,751
We've got the how, we've got the who,
but we don't have the why.

12
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,851
Here it is!

13
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:38,658
Hard to believe
one lad can cause all this mayhem.

14
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:41,961
Particularly a lad who failed
Introduction to Unscrewing.

15
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,834
And I don't buy this
Ione prankster theory.

16
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,962
I think there was a second fun man.

17
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:55,075
And if you don't identify him,
you're looking at a week suspension!

18
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,709
A nickel.

19
00:02:56,809 --> 00:03:01,247
Milhouse, you realize if you're suspended,
you'll be missing Taco Wednesday?

20
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:07,418
Crunchy shell, ground beef,
lettuce, mild sauce...

21
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,356
...and, of course,
shredded Cheddar cheese.

22
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,456
Mmm-mmm.

23
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:25,371
I'll never tell.
- Consider yourself suspended, mister.

24
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,474
Willie, take him to the big house...

25
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:28,608
...where he lives.

26
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,708
Let's go, lad.

27
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,907
Suspended boy walking!

28
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,197
Thanks for not selling me out, man.
- This really sucks, Bart.

29
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,732
I'm grounded and spend all day...

30
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:56,469
...listening to my dad yell
at Mad Money w / Jim Cramer.

31
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,172
You said tech stocks were bulletproof!

32
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,279
Look, I gotta go. But don't worry.
I'll visit you every day. I promise.

33
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,939
Bart, you're a true friend.

34
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,783
Bye.

35
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:17,991
Well, I'm glad they suspended Milhouse.
He's a bad influence on you.

36
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,686
You know, I think Milhouse is El Barto.

37
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,794
Hmm.

38
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,599
And now you're gonna visit your grampa...

39
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,779
...while I park around the corner
and take a nap.

40
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,446
So, Grampa, not like I'm anxious to go,

41
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:45,385
but I've been here 10 minutes,
which is like seven hours in kid years.

42
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,287
RESIDENTS: Oh, isn't she marvelous?

43
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:51,391
It's her! The little girl
who doesn't recoil at the sight of us!

44
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,559
Huh?

45
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,297
Hi, guys! I brought cookies.

46
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,669
Chocolate chip for Donald.

47
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,737
Low sodium for Abe.
- Hey!

48
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:09,175
Not made by immigrants for Sam,
and imaginary for Major Preston.

49
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:14,380
With this cookie, I can buy back
Private O'Malley from the Zulus.

50
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,551
I think it is so cool what you are doing.
So what's the gag?

51
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,959
You put ex-lax in the cookies,

52
00:05:20,059 --> 00:05:21,955
then just sit back and
watch the fireworks?

53
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,557
I would never do that!
- Oh, right.

54
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,126
I was thinking of other things
that are hilarious.

55
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,062
Like things that you think are funny.

56
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,697
Yeah, those are funny.
- Yeah.

57
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,799
I'm Bart.
- I'm Jenny.

58
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,937
BART: She had more curves
than a Hot Wheels track.

59
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:42,202
Well, she didn't yet,
but she would after puberty.

60
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,244
Oh, my God! How long was I zoned out?

61
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:49,249
Bart, this is my Aunt Belle.
We dress alike. Isn't that cute?

62
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,147
Math, done. Pinecone, collected.

63
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:55,521
Permission slip, signed.
Now time for a break,

64
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,782
a little social studies.

65
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,049
'What will Springfield
be like in 50 years?'

66
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:05,954
Let's see what the computer says.

67
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,136
That's horrible. What else?

68
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
Oh, my God!

69
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:23,078
It just gets worse and worse!

70
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,256
So who's the special someone?

71
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,925
Jenny, fifth grade girl.

72
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:36,850
Whoa!
She gets to use the real scissors. Nice.

73
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,866
When she talks to me,
I feel like a better person.

74
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,735
Powerful stuff.
You better claim her as your own.

75
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:43,836
Punch her in her arm.

76
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,606
Or if you're really serious,
stick gum in her hair.

77
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,171
Here, I always come prepared.

78
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,960
Take two. You might get lucky.

79
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,250
Hey, Jenny.
- Hi, Bart.

80
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:05,458
Boy, you make it look effortless.
And that kid's giving you zero pump.

81
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,873
Oh. You know what a girl likes to hear.

82
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:12,255
Seal the deal. Punch her. Punch her!

83
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,566
Punch her!

84
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,772
Hey, do you want to go
on a picnic tomorrow?

85
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:24,332
You'd love my PB & J.
The secret is no PB, double J.

86
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:28,038
It's a date.
- Yes!

87
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,051
Willie, I've got a girlfriend!

88
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:38,522
Really? Well, I do, too.
She's a bikini model from Sweden.

89
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,258
Hey, that's great.

90
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,901
Willie, darling, come back to bed.
Don't you love me?

91
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:53,166
Don't compete with my job, Inga.
You'll never win.

92
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:02,081
And now Ralph Wiggum will read
his essay on Springfield in 50 years.

93
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:08,297
In 50 years, the vacuum cleaner
will be quiet and not scary.

94
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,123
Next we have Lisa Simpson.

95
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:17,462
Oh, Ralph, how I envy your optimism.

96
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:20,400
There is no Springfield
50 years in the future!

97
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,337
With global warming trapping the CO2
inside our poisonous atmosphere,

98
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:28,307
our super-heated oceans will rise,
drowning our lowlands,

99
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:33,679
leaving what's left of humanity
baking in deserts that once fed the world!

100
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,742
And in the new Nineveh, darkness falls.

101
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,362
Lisa, your outburst was either
a sign of deep emotional imbalance...

102
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,231
...or a passionate response
to a sobering truth.

103
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,801
Luckily, the treatment for both
is intensive therapy.

104
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:58,204
What's therapy gonna do for me
when the world is in ashes?

105
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,272
Oh, I don't know.

106
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,874
But when you go, could you return
this Sports Illustrated for me?

107
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,677
Someone must've put it in my bag.

108
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:09,682
They do that, you know?
They're always putting things in my bag.

109
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,484
JENNY: So you visit old folks.

110
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:14,220
How else do you make
the world a better place?

111
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,688
Uh... I...

112
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:21,994
I spend a lot of time working
with this mentally challenged guy.

113
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,362
Why, here he is now.

114
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,672
Looking good, Homer!
- Boy.

115
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:30,657
He seems pretty high functioning.
- Just wait.

116
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,406
Don't shake your fist at me!

117
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,208
Look, man. I don't want any trouble.
Come on.

118
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:39,303
Here. Just take my wallet.
Leave me alone, okay?

119
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,350
Do you know who else
was really into rowboats?

120
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,353
Jesus. And he could've turned
his rowboat into a jet ski,

121
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:48,988
but he didn't. Good guy.

122
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,191
Cheese and crackers! Look!

123
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,797
Oh.
You want your duckling back? Here it is.

124
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,632
Psych!

125
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:04,403
That'll teach you to match wits with us,
you stupid mother duck!

126
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,572
Bart, can't you do something?

127
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,672
Mmm-hmm!

128
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:15,797
Those bullies are gonna kill me.
Why am I doing this?

129
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,583
Oh, yeah.

130
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,488
Please, guys, give me a break.

131
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,524
Can you give me the duckling
without beating me up?

132
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,193
Well, we'll have to beat you up a little.

133
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,997
Come on. I'm trying to impress a girl.
- So are we.

134
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,933
Either the duck suffers or the kid does...

135
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,836
...or none of you's getting nothing
from Shauna.

136
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,936
I'm Shauna.

137
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:48,681
Oh, Bart, if those ducklings understood
how magnificent you were,

138
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,161
they'd stop biting your leg.

139
00:10:56,055 --> 00:11:00,226
We believe Lisa is suffering
from environment-related despair.

140
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,397
It's even worse
when you know it has a name.

141
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,598
Now don't worry.

142
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,334
She'll be fine
after years of expensive treatment.

143
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:12,772
And we have a new drug
to combat this syndrome, Ignorital.

144
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,807
Let me show you how Ignorital works.

145
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,899
It turns this to this! Huh?

146
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,315
Lisa's a little young
to be taking happy pills.

147
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:25,284
Marge, we came to an appointment
in the middle of the day.

148
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,653
That's the most a parent can do.

149
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:30,898
We done here?
- Oh, go ahead. Numb me.

150
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,561
Mom, can I get those dishes for you?

151
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,175
What's your angle, mister?
- No angle.

152
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,769
If this girl I'm seeing comes here,
and she might,

153
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,469
I wouldn't mind if you told her

154
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:47,807
I was the kind of boy
that does the dishes.

155
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,443
Yeah. Busboys get all the chicks.

156
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:56,148
Well, off to school
where they'll prepare our little minds...

157
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,084
...for a future we'll never see.

158
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:02,179
Sounds like someone's
got a case of the Mondays.

159
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,291
I'm going to Dizzyland.

160
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,499
...

161
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,904
...I see trees of green

162
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,135
Red roses too

163
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,935
I see them bloom

164
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,506
For me and you

165
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,584
And I think to myself

166
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,585
What a wonderful world

167
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,026
So this is setting the table.

168
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,694
If I'd known how easy this was,

169
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,463
I'd have just done it
instead of throwing all those tantrums.

170
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,233
Oh, Bart, I don't care
that this is just an act.

171
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:52,433
You've finally become the boy
every mother dreams of, a girl!

172
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:06,619
You never told me that the special man
you were working with is your father.

173
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,439
It's not an easy thing to admit.

174
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:19,227
Is the rest of your family okay?

175
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,467
Well...

176
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:25,230
Hello, smiley face. Hello, smiley face!

177
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,008
CLANCY: Officer down.

178
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,214
Jenny, it's amazing
what you've done with my son.

179
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:41,087
Well, I think Bart is an incredible
combination of Habitat for Humanity...

180
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,122
...and the Jonas Brothers,

181
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,825
and nothing can ever change
my opinion about him.

182
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:55,501
We don't have any money! Go away!
May I de-corn your cob, my darling?

183
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,277
Why didn't you come to visit me, Bart?

184
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:08,681
Well, yeah, I meant to.
I've just been so busy.

185
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:09,982
My schedule's been all like...

186
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:14,587
But what could be more important
than your best friend?

187
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,687
Who's this, Bart?

188
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,157
Oh.

189
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,282
I see how it is.

190
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:24,578
Actually, I don't. My glasses are fogged.

191
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,739
Bart, I learned some great new
swear words from my uncle.

192
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,409
He has got a broken back,
so he's in constant pain.

193
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,746
Bart, would you be interested in swears?

194
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:43,015
Yes, because only by knowing them...

195
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:47,153
...can you prevent
bad little kids from saying them.

196
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,254
What do you want from me?

197
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:51,991
I wanna know why my best friend
didn't visit me like he said he would.

198
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,528
Milhouse, real best friends
often don't speak for years at a time,

199
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,630
like John Adams and Thomas Jefferson.

200
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,333
Just because you saw
one episode of one miniseries...

201
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,769
...doesn't mean you get
to use it as a whip!

202
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,272
Look, man.
I have to keep my dark past hidden.

203
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:09,108
There's someone new in my life now.

204
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,547
BART: Aw.

205
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:20,313
Oh, I get it. It's love.
I guess you've found your Abigail Adams.

206
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,888
My who?
- So I'll be on my way.

207
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:27,059
I can see I'm the fifth wheel
on this bicycle with training wheels.

208
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:33,109
But the next time I see you two,
I might not be able to hold my tongue.

209
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,191
It's really quite difficult.

210
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,809
Reverend, care for some
of my devil's food cake?

211
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,078
Is that really devil's food?

212
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:50,783
No. It's angel food with chocolate on top.
- Mmm-hmm. I knew it.

213
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:51,851
Sorry I'm late.

214
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,675
I didn't realize you had
to turn the oven on...

215
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:54,253
...to bake stuff.

216
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,622
So, Jenny, I hear you're religious.

217
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,158
Know what my favorite
book of the Bible is?

218
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,258
Revelations.

219
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,428
Mine, too.

220
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,965
Bart, we should take Milhouse
on our trip to Juice Country.

221
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:09,001
Are you nuts?
Milhouse will spill everything.

222
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,003
By which I mean juice, not secrets.

223
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:14,078
Yeah. You guys don't want me there.

224
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,588
But I'm sure we'll see each other soon.

225
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,351
Bart, you look tense. Have a cookie.

226
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,932
...

227
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,507
...Don't worry

228
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,077
Be happy

229
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,507
Don't worry, be happy

230
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:02,482
If you don't stop smiling,
you're gonna get a kiss.

231
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,158
LISA: Huh?

232
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:09,828
That's it! We're getting you off the meds!

233
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,976
We should be safe from Milhouse here.
Being at sea level gives him nosebleeds.

234
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,177
Milhouse is funny.

235
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,112
The way he's always shaking me
by the shoulders...

236
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,883
...and saying I don't know the real you.
Funny.

237
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,652
I'm tired of talking about Milhouse!

238
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:37,745
Hello, Bart.
Surprised to see me at sea level?

239
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,993
Well, you can't bleed out your nose
when your heart's broken.

240
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,129
Milhouse, could you stop being creepy
for just a minute?

241
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,464
No.

242
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:50,035
Jenny, do you see how the dolphin
in that tank seems to shy away from Bart?

243
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,004
Why might that be?

244
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,841
Oh.

245
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:59,311
Jenny, I can't take the pressure anymore.
I have to come clean.

246
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,046
I'm only pretending to be good.

247
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:06,752
Before I met you, I was El Barto,
Skinner's Bane, the Sultan of Spit Wads,

248
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,954
the Dean of D-Minus, the Ay Caramba Kid!

249
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,054
No, no, no, no.

250
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,359
But now I'm good
because you turned me good!

251
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,027
Isn't that all that matters?

252
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:19,465
Are you saying
our entire relationship is based on lies?

253
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:23,815
Not our entire relationship.
Just the stuff I said.

254
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,771
I can't believe she dumped me!

255
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:37,549
Oh, son, girls come and go.
But you'll always have your family.

256
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,981
I know! I know!

257
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,665
Hit me again, Pu.

258
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:54,933
Whatever you are looking for,

259
00:18:55,033 --> 00:19:00,005
it is not at the bottom of a 512-ounce cup
of Shrek Berry Blast.

260
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,808
What is at the bottom
is this dumb Shrek trivia quiz,

261
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:08,213
which if answered correctly,
entitles you to 10% off any Shrek DVD,

262
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,882
except the first two.

263
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:17,056
Bart, in my concurrent adventure,
I learned a really important lesson.

264
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:22,171
You can't wallow in despair.
Face things as they really are.

265
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:25,731
You're right! I've gotta
straighten this out.

266
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,358
How much for these roses, Apu?
- $10.

267
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,607
Okay, I...
What happened to my roses, Apu?

268
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,409
You said you'd watch them
while I shopped.

269
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,144
No such conversation took place.

270
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,113
What am I gonna put on
my grandmother's grave?

271
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,548
How about this standee...

272
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,878
...from last year's Super Bowl?
- Sold!

273
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:50,656
Grandma, a lot has happened.
I went to a condo presentation.

274
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:54,359
I put down my deposit.
But then they lost funding mid-project.

275
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:58,097
That crane just sits there every day,
rusting.

276
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,799
I'm so sorry
I tried to deny who I really was.

277
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,602
You deserve better.
I'll never hurt you again.

278
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:09,106
Can you forgive me?
- Oh, Bart, I was born forgiving you.

279
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,945
You've always been there for me, man.
I'll never turn my back on you again.

280
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,572
Punch him. Punch him! Punch him!

281
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,787
Milhouse, what do you say
to a makeup prank?

282
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:27,329
Smooth and slippery.
Thank you, Zamboni King.

283
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,426
Happy to oblige.

284
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,033
Simpson!

285
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,368
Skinner!

286
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,070
Cue music.

287
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,204

288
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,499
And cue snow.

289
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,238
English - US - SDH
