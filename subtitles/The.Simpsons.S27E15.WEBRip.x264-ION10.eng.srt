00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,691
{\an8}performed emergency CPR

97
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,648
{\an8}on a drowning nuisance animal,

98
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:34,518
{\an8}while dozens of unheroic onlookers
just stood around.

99
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,067
{\an8}Where was Channel Six news?

100
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,030
{\an8}Filming gas pumps
and their ever-changing prices.

101
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,162
{\an8}Which accomplishes what?
I don't know.

102
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,702
{\an8}DIRECTOR:
There's eight minutes left.

103
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,445
{\an8}-Uh, did we do gas prices?
-Yes!

104
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,712
(giggles)
We saw you on the picture radio.

105
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,382
They chyroned your name.

106
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,960
They described you as "Local Girl."

107
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,336
Hubba, hubba.
They sure got that right. (growls)

108
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,505
Lisa, it looks like
you're the perfect student

109
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,223
to look after Nibbles the hamster here
during spring break.

110
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,515
I'd take him with me, but I'm doing
Jell-O shots with former students.

111
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,979
This spring break,
I'm gonna go wild with responsibility!

112
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:15,401
My dad's spending spring break
in a cage, too.

113
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:19,191
And for saving that raccoon,
I got the opposite of teasing.

114
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,237
I bet the Germans
have a word for it, like, uh,

115
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,911
<i>gerstronkenplatzen </i>or something.
(chuckles)

116
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,240
I wish the Germans had a word
for this terrible traffic.

117
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,997
And so ends the moment being about me.

118
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,749
What's going on, Chief?

119
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,461
Oh, nasty car crash.

120
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,081
Can't let traffic through

121
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,418
until the cleanup crew mops up this mess.

122
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,923
Which is a problem,

123
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,335
because they're stuck in traffic
behind you.

124
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,510
Okay, who did that?!

125
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,093
We need to get home.

126
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,428
I left my father-in-law on the sofa.

127
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,023
He's got to be turned.

128
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,518
Yeah, well, that ain't gonna happen.

129
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,940
Not unless you clean up
this accident scene. (chuckles)

130
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,349
Actually, seriously, could you do that?

131
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,107
Hmm, I don't know.

132
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,979
I'm one of those people who doesn't like

133
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,686
being traumatized by horrifying sights.

134
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,277
Marge, do you know why
I became a cop?

135
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,533
If you do, could you tell me?
'Cause it's-it's really dangerous.

136
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,326
B-But these crime scene cleanups,
they're totally safe.

137
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,950
All the bad people are dead
or, uh, at large.

138
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,368
So give it a shot.

139
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,456
Please. Please, Mom.

140
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,956
Huh?

141
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,134
Oh, all right.

142
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,221
There you go. Spick and span.

143
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,808
Wow, you even made
the homeless guy look nice.

144
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,055
Yeah, still crazy, though.

145
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,067
You know, Marge, uh, you ever want
some fast extra cash,

146
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,240
we are always looking
for crime scene cleaner-uppers.

147
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,990
You know what they say--
crime always pays.

148
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,031
Plus, you can keep any money you find,

149
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,998
and any jewelry that isn't monogrammed.

150
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,869
{\an8}(bicycle bell dings)

151
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,995
Hello, little girl.

152
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,167
Oh, does your hamster
have Tyzzer's disease?

153
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,757
That would've been interesting,

154
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,512
but I swabbed him for Tyzzer's
and it came up negative.

155
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,644
My. You certainly know
a lot about animals.

156
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,562
That's just it, I do.

157
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,481
I saved a raccoon's life the other day.

158
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,270
It was the best feeling I've ever had.

159
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,273
Is there any way
I could work in your office?

160
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,565
I mean, as an intern or anything?

161
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,699
Oh, do you know how many people
walk in here every day

162
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,448
looking for just such a thing?

163
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,620
-A lot, I bet.
-No, it's never happened.

164
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,620
Grab a clean smock and follow me.

165
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,503
Oh, okay! (giggles)

166
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,334
I can't find a clean smock.

167
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,916
Then your first job
is to clean the smocks.

168
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,513
-(bell dings)
-I'm ready, Dr. Budgie.

169
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,429
Oh, it's a shame to ruin
such a clean smock,

170
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,838
but, uh, let's go.

171
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,926
Hmm.

172
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,392
(squeals)

173
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,765
(sputters)

174
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,730
This is heaven.

175
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,190
You got to help me, Doc.

176
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,360
My pet ferret has lost
its terrible stink!

177
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,900
Well, that won't do.

178
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,903
Let me have a go at jump-starting

179
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,395
the old stink gland.

180
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,907
Lisa, my dear,
can you restrain the ferret?

181
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,949
It would be my honor.

182
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,039
{\an8}-Clear!
-(electrical buzz)

183
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,915
{\an8}We have stink lines!

184
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,629
{\an8}Well done, Lisa.

185
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,919
Heaven! (chuckles)

186
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,673
Ew.

187
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,638
-(barking)
-(meowing)

188
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:34,348
-(horse neighs)
-All right, Veggie Kibble for Daisy here.

189
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,350
Chairman Meow is having surgery tomorrow,
so only liquid for you.

190
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,854
And no more food for you, Mr. Snake,

191
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,187
until you finish shedding your skin.

192
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,192
Oh. You have.

193
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:50,065
Dr. Budgie, I'm really enjoying
cleaning out these cages.

194
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:53,744
No, really, I am, but are there any jobs
that are more exciting?

195
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,124
Absolutely.

196
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,951
You can hobble these crickets.

197
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,456
We have a hungry chameleon
who's slowing down with age,

198
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,040
but he still loves
the thrill of the hunt.

199
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,335
Mm. Anything more life or deathy?

200
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,209
I could take the animals' temperature.

201
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,716
I know what that means,
and I am up for it.

202
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,759
Oh, Lisa, slow down.

203
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,642
Do you know how many
awkward courses I had to take

204
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,140
before they let me
put my arm inside a horse?

205
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,393
I understand.

206
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,604
I just feel like I could be doing more.

207
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,225
Oh, you remind me
of a certain young man

208
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,152
growing up
in Stratfordshire-on-Corningwell.

209
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,032
He, too, was impatient.

210
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,279
Always thinking he could do more.

211
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,741
-Was that you?
-No.

212
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,911
If that was me, I would have said "me."

213
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,950
This eager beaver

214
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,743
had to leave veterinary school
and become--

215
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,998
-ugh-- a people doctor.
-Ooh.

216
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,881

221
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,683
The old one doesn't seem safe.

222
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,183

223
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,095
It's fine.
And it saves us money on haircuts.

225
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,319

Ha! I just got that.

232
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,955
Chief, Chief, this is Marge Simpson.

233
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,329
I think I'd like to do
some of those crime scene cleanups.

234
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,087
Oh, great, great.
Hey, I got a job for you right here.

235
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,630
Uh, murder-suicide.

236
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,723
Or possibly a suicide-murder.

237
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,178
Just bring a mop and your imagination.

238
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,389
Hey, it can't be worse
than what I've seen.

239
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,600
Homer, I told you not to eat chili
out of the colander!

240
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,021
Uh, it's pronounced "calendar."

241
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,610
{\an8}What's the matter, little guy?
You haven't touched your berries.

242
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,978
{\an8}Do you need aphids for flavor?

243
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,356
{\an8}Mmm. Aphids.

244
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,243

Lisa, could you come here for a moment?

245
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,951
{\an8}(gasps) At last.

246
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,082
I'm trying to give this
Saint Bernard a shot,

247
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,080
but my hands are a little shaky.

248
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,872
I had an extra gallon of tea for lunch.

249
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,126
-Oh, my.
-If I hold him,

250
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,339
do you think you could attend
to the matter of the needle?

251
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,590
Of course!

252
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,087
-Mm.
-Careful, careful.

253
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,425
A single millimeter either way

254
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,261
would not make much of a difference.

255
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,851
<i>LISA: Huh. Why am I not feeling</i>

260
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,277
Hey, a mess is a mess.

261
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,043
Huh?

262
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,344
{\an8}Let me start with this
filthy crime scene tape.

00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,682
{\an8}Yarr, is the doctor in, miss?

265
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:04,061
{\an8}Little Goldie here
is listing hard to starboard.

266
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,690
{\an8}I fear he may have tangled
with the wrong plastic diver.

267
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,808
{\an8}Hmm. Could be fin rot.

268
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,605
{\an8}Oh, no, not the big F. Arr!

269
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,440
{\an8}Do what you must.
I'll say my good-byes.

270
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:19,776
You were more wife to me
than any woman I ever knew.

271
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,124
Captain, the diagnosis of fin rot

272
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,199
is not the death sentence it used to be.

273
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,195
A couple drops of medicine in the water,
and he'll be fine.

274
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,502
Hmm.

275
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,248
Yarr, that's amazing!

276
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:37,011
Eh, I've just got one more
little problem.

277
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,889
He, uh... he ate me car keys. Yarr.

278
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,008

279
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,095
Hurry, Doc!
His lungs are full of seltzer!

280
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,062

283
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,189
(grunts)

284
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,784
Homie? Notice anything?

285
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,950
(beeping)

286
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,195
(alarm beeping)

287
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,953
Um, are you having an affair?

288
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,786
What? No.

289
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,421
I bought a new ceiling fan. Huh?

290
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,419
Ooh, I thought the air felt
a little more lively.

291
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,802
But where did you get the money?

292
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:20,048
Actually, I made a little extra
by cleaning up crime scenes.

293
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,222
What? Poor Marge.

294
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,011
I heard that can really mess you...

295
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,715
Oh, baby, that cool air is sweet!

296
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,057
...up.

297
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,811
Are you sure you're not living
a waking nightmare?

298
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,404
No. Not one little bit.

299
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,189
And I get the police discount
on cleaning supplies.

300
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,073
I can finally clean Grampa's dentures.

301
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:43,241
Yeah, I got popcorn in there
from <i>Kramer vs. Kramer.</i>

302
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,122
I was rooting for Kramer,

303
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,079
but was dismayed
when Kramer finally won.

304
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,830
That's a twist I didn't see Kramer.

305
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,589
Happy birthday, Martin.
Where's the gift table?

306
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,839
(chuckles)
Right over there, my friend.

307
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,882

308
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,718
Haw haw!

310
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,893
-(giggles)
-Some zoo.

311
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,684
Where are the rental strollers?

312
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,477
Actually, it's not so bad.

313
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,151
The animals are healthy.

314
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,439
A couple of paddock scrapes,
but nothing overly concerning.

315
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,654
Oh, knock it off. You're not a vet.

316
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,494
You're a glorified cage scrubber.

317
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,490
Dr. Budgie depends upon me!

318
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,412
I have felt the cold breath
of kennel cough in my face.

319
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,291
I have seen tabbies
that were more tick than cat.

320
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,289
I know why the caged dog scoots.

321
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,962
So when your lizard loses its tail,

322
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,131
you're gonna need me to tell you

323
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,630
-it's gonna grow back.
-(sighs)

324
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,723
Want some peanuts, Mr. Elephant?

325
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,678
Uh, it's a goat, not an elephant,

326
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,258
and those are shrimp, not peanuts.

327
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,143
And that goat is allergic to shrimp!

328
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,890
Your breath smells like
"don't drink that."

329
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,433
(worried bleat)

330
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,436
Milhouse, give me your EpiPen!

331
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,148
You're not a professional.

332
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,768
I am a self-selected
unpaid veterinary intern.

333
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,226
Now let me practice my craft!

334
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,815
(bleating excitedly)

335
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,988
Hey, he's as good as new.
Look at him play with the kids!

336
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,157
(kids grunting)

337
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,076
See, Bart? Life or death.

338
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,705
I make the choice.

339
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,251
Okay, time to cut the cake.

340
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,550
(bleats triumphantly)

341
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,132
That's my patient.

342
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,350
Guess what, sweetie.

343
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,022
I'm wearing my snuggle socks.

344
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,941
They're compression socks
from your heart surgery.

345
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,521
All the same...

346
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,646
(purring)

347
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,233
(sighs)

348
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,738
I'm not in the mood.

349
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,159
What?! You've never said that before!

350
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,238
I've thought it three times.

351
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,954
Each time was after
a burrito-eating contest.

352
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,785
But I won!

353
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,040
What's wrong?

354
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,041
It's just that seeing you, lying down,

355
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,714
reminds me of this bloated corpse
I had to clean up today.

356
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,215
Hey, I look damn good for someone
who eats the crap I do.

357
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,338
Maybe we should just go to sleep.

358
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,835
I wasn't done with my drink.

359
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,598
Would you like
my itty-bitty booze light?

360
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,561
{\an8}I've never seen him like this.
He's so listless.

361
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,734
{\an8}Who's lost the urge to kill?

362
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,613
{\an8}Who's lost the urge to kill?

363
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,650
{\an8}I'll tell you what's wrong with him--

364
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,403
{\an8}-you.
-What? Me?!

365
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,605
{\an8}This dog is badly behind on his shots.

366
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,906
{\an8}He's displaying the symptoms
of early onset parvo.

367
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,701
{\an8}I'm confiscating your dog.

368
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,584
And, you, get out!

369
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,411
Smithers, I've been shamed.

370
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,456
Prepare a thimble of ice cream.

371
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,750
Some people don't deserve to own pets.

372
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,794
BART: And you get to decide who?

373
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,087
Don't fold your arms at me.

374
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,921
Lis, look at yourself.

375
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,927
You've become so arrogant,
you've forgotten who you are.

376
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,510
And even worse, you've forgotten Nibbles!

377
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,431
(gasps) Nibbles!

378
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,476
My pet! My responsibility!

379
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,480
My homework!

380
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,112
{\an8}(gasps) Matted hair, dry tongue...

381
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,859
{\an8}Is this true, Lisa?

382
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:09,531
{\an8}Did you let this happen
to a creature in your care?

383
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,361
{\an8}I'm so sorry.

384
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,867
{\an8}I'm so, so sorry.

385
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,329
{\an8}Pet hamsters need to be
played with regularly,

386
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,951
{\an8}or they feel abandoned.

387
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,708
{\an8}And that can lead
to stress polyps on the heart.

388
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,630
{\an8}The heart is the seat of love, Lisa.

389
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,380
{\an8}If you'd gone to veterinary school,
you'd know that.

390
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,473
{\an8}I've got no choice but to operate.

391
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,218
{\an8}And I need your help.

392
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,970
{\an8}You still want me to help you
after I was so arrogant?

393
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,814
Lisa, arrogance
is what made the British Empire.

394
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,891
Then lost it.

395
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,135
Then pretended it didn't happen.

396
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,606
(monitor beeping steadily)

397
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,688
{\an8}Well, we've done all we can.

398
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,654
{\an8}The next 24 hours will be crucial.

399
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,485
{\an8}-(monitor flatlining)
-Oh, he's gone.

400
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,360
{\an8}(crying) No, no, no.

401
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,737
He can't be dead!

402
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,164
He can't!

403
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,952
I thought we could save every animal

404
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,207
if we just cared enough.

405
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,499
Okay, Marge, sweetie, look at this one.

406
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,844
See, Marge? The baby laughs
every time the toaster pops.

407
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,091
(chuckles) It is pretty hysterical.

408
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,383
-That's nice.
-Nice?

409
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,717
Something in you is dead, Marge,

410
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,353
and that's one crime scene
you can't clean up.

411
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,020
And all for a fan.

412
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,389
A stupid ceiling fan that...

413
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,226
Oh, man, that's refreshing.

414
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,191
I want my Marge back.

415
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,691
(cell phone rings)

416
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,573
Hello? What is it, boy?

417
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,860
Uh-huh. I see.

418
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:32,954
Fine, Marge.

419
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:36,448
You sit here,
watch your boob tube, have a beer.

420
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,742
That's not how Homer Simpson
does things.

421
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,486
I have to go help Lisa!

422
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,211
Lisa?

423
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,288
Wait! Wait, I'm coming with you.

424
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,054
-(door closes)
-(phone ringing)

425
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,379
(line ringing)

426
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,763
No answer.

427
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,380
I guess we got to do this ourselves.

428
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,970
Oh, geez.

429
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,894
All right, get some paper towels, boys.

430
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,734
(chain saw buzzing)

431
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,977
-Lisa.
-(sniffling)

432
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,902
Oh, Mom, he trusted me
as only a hamster can!

433
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,153
(crying)

434
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,404
If there's one thing
I'll always clean up,

435
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,406
it's my baby's tears.

436
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,568
Oh, I should've been here for you.

437
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,157
You would've never let
anything happen to him.

438
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,042
-I was too busy being dead inside...
-Wherever he went,

439
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,909
-I hope they have hamster balls.
-...doing I don't know what!

440
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,077
-But I'm here now, and I'll never leave.
-(chuckles)

441
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,087
Well, I'll be.

442
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,459
Lisa's learning about death
helped Marge feel again.

443
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,757
Yes, a perfect dovetail.

444
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,091
Thank you for curing Walter Pigeon here.

445
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,507
I can't afford to pay you,
but I can give you

446
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,346
front row seats to my magic show.

447
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,101
-The theme is boxing.
-Sounds marvelous.

448
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,604
Oh, yeah, no. Come on, it is.

449
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:54,484
