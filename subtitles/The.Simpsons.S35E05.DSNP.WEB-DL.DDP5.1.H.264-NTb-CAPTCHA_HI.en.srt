00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:50,041
[as Homer] When did insurance
commercials get so funny?

353
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:53,208
[screams] Marge.

354
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:57,667
Cooperating with us is the only
way to get your wife back to normal.

355
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,959
You've never looked
more beautiful.

356
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:05,709
Scooch over, gorgeous.

357
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:09,542
When we get home,
let's you and I bump muzzles.

358
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,875
Please, please.

359
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,709
If we don't have some competent
people left to run things,

360
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:15,250
society will collapse.

361
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:19,375
Coders to run the Internet that
feeds you the latest misinformation.

362
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,625
Pilots to fly the planes
you need to be restrained on.

363
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:24,709
I mean, a world
without experts...

364
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:26,875
Does Beaker ever shut up?

365
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,792
[chuckles] Good one, Me-Marge.

366
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,417
Well, you leave me no choice.

367
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,458
I'm calling in
a nuclear air strike

368
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:35,667
to obliterate all
the "Homerized" Springfielders,

369
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,500
including... very sadly... the
touring company of Kinky Boots.

370
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,000
Obliterating in three, two...

371
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,250
Hey, you know what you need?

372
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,250
A nice relaxing scratch
on the back.

373
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,250
No! No!

374
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:51,583
Oh! A lifetime of study
and education down the...
