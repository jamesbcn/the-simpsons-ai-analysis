1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,264
{\an8}Come on, everybody.

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,469
Time for the family portrait.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,470
(toys squeaking and rattling)

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,141
Let’s bunch together now.

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,049
Here we go.

6
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,141
Move it!

7
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,312
Perfecto.

8
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,641
Everybody smile.

9
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,476
I’m going to set
the automatic timer.

10
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,145
Almost ready.
Here we go.

11
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,822
Let’s get this show
on the road, man.

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,030
We got things
to do.

13
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,110
Yeah, Dad.

14
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,454
Okay, here we go.

15
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,409
Make room
for Jumbo.

16
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,029
-What’d you say?
-Nothing.

17
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,286
All right, everybody,
squeeze in real tight.

18
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,998
I want to get us all in
the picture this time.

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,369
Closer.

20
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,286
Closer!

21
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,714
Okay, hold still.

22
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,884
This is the last
picture on the roll.

23
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,133
Praise the Lord.

24
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,844
You watch your mouth,
you little smart-ass.

25
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:52,644
LISA:
Yeah, Bart.

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,389
Nothing’s going
to ruin this one.

27
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,851
The timer’s a-ticking.

28
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,100
Bart’s making
faces, Dad.

29
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,022
Bart!

30
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,230
This one’s going to be
the Simpsons at our finest.

31
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,732
Smile, look cheerful.

32
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:07,983
Here we go.
Here we go.

33
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,358
Here we go.

34
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,864
Why, you little...

35
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,302
{\an8}MARGE:
Kitty cat.

36
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,295
{\an8}Elmo.

37
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,891
{\an8}Um... uh...

38
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,058
{\an8}Watering can.

39
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,944
{\an8}(gasping)

40
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,061
{\an8}This is a nightmare.

41
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,817
{\an8}We’re getting blown
out of the water.

42
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,569
{\an8}Eh, what can I say?

43
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,821
{\an8}Maggie and I share
a special bond.

44
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,490
{\an8}School bus?

45
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,076
{\an8}Bart and Lisa?

46
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:03,041
{\an8}Bart and Lisa are
almost home from school,

47
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,253
{\an8}and we have a dentist
appointment at 3:00.

48
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,423
{\an8}Thanks, Maggie.

49
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,212
{\an8}We win by forfeit.

50
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,297
{\an8}The sweetest win
there is.

51
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,513
{\an8}(puffing noisily)

52
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,224
{\an8}(starter motor revving)

53
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,724
{\an8}It won’t start.

54
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,017
{\an8}I’ll just use Homer’s
AAA card.

55
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:27,941
American Applesauce Association?

56
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,152
{\an8}We’re going to have to run.

57
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,072
There isn’t even time
to stretch my quads.

58
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,702
My quads!

59
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,198
Every stride is a nightmare!

60
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:40,371
(yodeling theme from
<i>Raising Arizona </i>playing)

61
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,587
-Whoops.
-Aww.

62
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,427
(nervous chuckle)

63
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,051
WIGGUM:
Ow!

64
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,638
How you holding up, Maggie?

65
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,098
(truck horn honking)

66
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,353
(screaming)

67
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,104

68
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,726

69
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,152
(yodeling continues)

70
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,317
(yelping)

71
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,025
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

72
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,544
(squeaking, snarling)

73
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,463
Hey, Marge.

74
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,264
Oh! Ah! Oh! Oh!

75
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,049
(bagpipes playing)

76
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,136

77
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,058
(barking)

78
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,356
MARGE:
We’re gonna make it.

79
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,113
(panting)

80
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,525
Marge Simpson, I just heard the
most delicious piece of gossip.

81
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,954
MARGE:
Tell me later!

82
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:01,872
{\an8}(yelling)

83
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,123
Oh, hi, kids.

84
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,164
You’re just in time
to go to the dentist.

85
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,788
Dentist?

86
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,594
{\an8}You said we were going to ride
dirt bikes around the cemetery.

87
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,589
{\an8}Oh, Bart, you fall for
that every six months.

88
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,552
{\an8}Hey, suckers,
check it out.

89
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,843
{\an8}Marge is taking me
to ride dirt bikes
at the cemetery.

90
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,008
{\an8}You’re going to the
dentist, too, Dad.

91
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:28,477
{\an8}Why the cemetery, I wondered,
but my dreams were too strong.

92
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,399
(drill whirring)

93
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,691
{\an8}Ah...

94
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,362
{\an8}Mr. Simpson, have you
been flossing regularly?

95
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,571
{\an8}Absolutely.

96
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,991
{\an8}All the time.

97
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,989
{\an8}I go to the floss store
and they’re like,

98
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,201
{\an8}"Whoa, there he is again."

99
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,912
{\an8}(nervous chuckle):
’Cause I buy
so much floss.

100
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,293
Let’s just get started.

101
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,538
{\an8}Oh, my God! My gums!

102
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,583
{\an8}They hurt so much!

103
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,207
{\an8}I haven’t started yet.

104
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,134
{\an8}I know, but a breeze
from the window
went in my mouth.

105
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,553
{\an8}(sighs)

106
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,881
(screaming)

107
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,427
{\an8}(screaming continues)

108
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,681
{\an8}You butcher!

109
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,432
{\an8}Don’t worry, sweetie.

110
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,064
{\an8}I’m sure that man has
some special tooth problem.

111
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,982
{\an8}HOMER:
I don’t even have
a special tooth problem!

112
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,561
{\an8}This is just a routine checkup!

113
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,817
(screaming continues)

114
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,150
Oh, the bib is choking me!

115
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,896
(with normal voice):
It’s over?

116
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,028
(chuckles):
That wasn’t so bad.

117
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,775
This tape explains
oral hygiene

118
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,577
in a way that’s
exciting for kids.

119
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,750
(hip-hop style announcer):

120
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,054
Damn, baby got bacteria.

121
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,054
You want to stick it
to these whiteys?

122
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,546
Hey, I’m down
with OPP--

but it also kind
of glamorizes it.

for a onetime only showing
in Canada, understand?

145
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,446
Do ya?

146
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,696
I’m sorry. There must have been
some sort of misunder...

147
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,708
Expect a letter from
Cap In The Ass Productions

148
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,501
and its head legal counsel,
Ms. Melissa Burlingame!

149

Peace out!

150
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,094
Here’s a free toothbrush.

151
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,513
Keep those teeth clean.

152
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,931
So you’re saying I should do
your job for you,

153
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,350
at home, for free.

154
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,639
You wish.

Okay, Principal Skinner,
I want you to relax.

157
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,153
Just lie completely
at ease

158
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,320
while I administer
the nitrous.

159
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,649
I shall.

160
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,863
(breathes deeply)

161
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,454
The dentist will
be here in a minute.

162
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,609
He’ll know exactly
what he’s doing.

163
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,278
Don’t resist
in any way.

164

00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,301
Good afternoon,
Principal Stinkface.

168
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,458
Dr. Bart.

169
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,706
Let’s see...

170
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,217
according to your charts,

171
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,009
you’re due for your annual
throat scraping.

172
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:52,643
Uh-oh, I’m feeling a lot
of cooties down there.

173
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,182
We may need to replace a tooth.

174
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,060
(groans)

175
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,977
Now rinse.

176
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,777
Finally, I’m going
to take an X-ray

177
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,451
so lie perfectly still
for 20 minutes.

178
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,320
(machine buzzing)

179
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,327
Don’ you love that
clean mouth feeling?

180
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,580
Sure do.

181
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,121
Let’s go get ice cream.

182
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,325
I can’t wait to get
the freshness out
of my mouth.

183
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,335
I’m going to glue my mouth shut
with butterscotch.

184
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:25,838
(sighs):
Oh. Yay.

185
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,220
What the hell
is a fundae?

186
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,430
It’s a sundae
that’s fun.

187
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,011
I like that, but I’m on
a bit of a health kick.

188
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,266
So I’ll take
the low-fat vanilla--

189
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,729
with the following mix-ins:

190
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,268
Snickles, Gooey Bears,

191
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,192
Charlottesville Chew,
Nice ’N’ Many,

192
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:46,401
Kat Kit, Herschel’s Smooches,
Mrs. Bad Bar, and Milk Dudes.

193
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,444
Cup or cone?

194
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,237
Uh... cone!

195
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,700
(gasps)
(bell ringing)

196
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,370
♪ Celebrate good times,
come on... ♪

197
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,370
Congratulations.

198
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,212
You just purchased
the one millionth ice-cream cone

199
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,038
sold by this store!

200
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,923
Oh, my God, this is amazing!

201
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,500
Wait, I’m gonna be driving.

202
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,875
I’ll go for the cup.

203
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,672
-(music stops)
-BART:
Dad!

204
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,335
Fine, cone.

205
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,133
-(bell rings, music resumes)
-What’s this?!

206
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,008
Tonight on <i>Smartline,</i>

207
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,635
a provocative discussion
of the Middle East...

208
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,141
will not be featured.

209
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,813
Instead, we’ll be talking
to a man

210
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,431
who bought
an ice-cream cone.

211
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,308
That’s me.

212
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,935
Of course that has nothing
to do with the fact

213
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,311
that this station
and the ice-cream company

214
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,568
are owned
by the same corporation,

215
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,109
but I digress.

216
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,782
All right, let’s just
get through this.

217
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,360
Mr. Simpson,
tell us how it felt

218
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,445
when you bought
the fateful treat.

219
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,951
I’ve never been to war,

220
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,622
but I imagine it feels just
like your first kill.

221
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,872
The happiness swept me away!

222
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,584
(screams)
That hurt like a...

223
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,834
(muttered obscenities)

224
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,587
What’d I miss?

225
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,089
Kent Brockman said
a horrible swear.

226
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,051
Which one?

227
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,264
Uh,
I’ll Etch-A-Sketch it for you.

228
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,353
Etch... sketch...
etch... sketch...

229
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,099
(cries out)

230
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,350
Shake it! Shake it!

231
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,725
It won’t come off.

232
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,730
Where’s the hammer?

233
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,273
(sighs)

234
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,321
Earlier on this broadcast,
I said a word so vile

235
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,704
it should only be uttered
by Satan himself

236
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,451
while sitting on the toilet.

237
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,083
I apologize,

238
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,750
and will make a large donation

239
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,248
to charities
that fight teen cursing.

240
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,460
Good night.

241
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,794
(sighs heavily)

242
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,421
Hmph, people
don’t seem so mad.

243
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,380
Uh, excuse me, sir.

244
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,837
Did you see my
broadcast tonight?

245
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,966
Oh, God, no, I get my news
from the Internet

246
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,104
like every other
normal person under 70.

247
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,351
Farewell, dinosaur.

248
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,273
No one saw my show.

249
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,562
So, no one heard
my filthy faux pas.

250
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,856
My career is safe.

251
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,398
Well, the important
thing is

252
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,482
we got through
this crisis together.

253
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,897
That makes us
friends, right?

254
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,695
Uh, hey, look,
it’s the airport bus.

255
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,739
You should get on it.

256
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,821
(deflated):
Okay.

257
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,408
America West, please.

258
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,711
GRAMPA:
<i>I can’t believe</i>

259
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,381
Kent Brockman
got away with it.

260
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,549
Back in my day, TV stars
couldn’t say "booby,"

261
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,379
"tushie," "burp," "fanny burp,"
"water closet," "underpants,"

262
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,506
"dingle-dangle,"
"Boston marriage,"

263
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,723
"LBJ," "Titicaca,"

264
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,854
"hot dog," or "front lumps"!

265
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,558
I’m not sure Brockman’s
out of the woods yet.

266
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,566
There are a lot of religious
watchdog groups out there

267
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,689
keeping the world safe from
the horror of free expression.

268
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,857
You mean there are losers
who spend all day watching TV

269
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,697
looking for stuff
to complain about?

270
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,332
Who’d be lame enough to do that?

271
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,079
Okay, <i>Smallville...</i>

272
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,041
super dog licks himself.

273
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,252
That definitely goes
in the naughty pile.

274
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,002
Hmph.

275
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,212
<i>60 Minutes...</i>

276
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,506

<i>The L Word...</i>

278
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,759
Used the "L" word.

279
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,929
And now to peruse
the local news.

280
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,562
The happiness
swept me away.

281
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,646
(screams)
Oh, that hurt like a...

282
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,822
(whistles, toots, chimes)

285
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,068

Daddy, what are you doing?

289
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,999
Imploring people I never met

290
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,672
to pressure a government
with better things to do

291
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,001
to punish a man
who meant no harm

292
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,455
for something nobody even saw.

293
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,375
That’s what I’m doing.

294
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,466

you need a new mommy.

{\an8}it will launch a full inquiry

298
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,977
{\an8}into garbage-tongued anchorman
Kent Brockman?

299
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,811
{\an8}In a related story, Channel Six
will demote Brockman

300

{\an8}to... weekend weatherman?!

301

{\an8}Dear God,
this can’t be happening.

302
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,700
(flat):
It’s a glorious day
here in Springfield.

303
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,906
Light winds, low humidity.

304
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,826
Now, let’s check
the five-day forecast.

305
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,625
What the...?!

306
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,248
(high-pitched):
Even the map thinks
you stink, Kent.

00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,125
(laughing)

308
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,302

Oh! Now he’s gonna starve.

320
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,988
Proud of yourself, Kent?

(sighs heavily)

322
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,331
Kids, your old pal Krusty
has had to make a few cutbacks

323
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,960

against the station.

Yay!

325
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,328
That’s a bad thing.

326
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,836
Anyway, we can’t afford to pay
the voice actors

Damn that Brockman!

There are only two rules in TV:

00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,960
don’t swear,
and don’t whip it out.

Haw, haw!

356
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,208
Your distinguished
career is over!

357
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,805
(groaning)

358
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,364
Marge, the couch is lumpy!

359
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,148
That’s because you’re
sitting on me, you lummox!

360
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,481
Kent Brockman!

361
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,146
I invited him to stay
with us for a few days.

362
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,985
His career is ruined.

363
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,451
And I was afraid he might
commit you-know-what-icide.

364
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,622
I’m sorry, Marge,

365
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,290
but I won’t live
under the same roof

366
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,959
as a member of
the liberal media.

367
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,998
You’ll have
to excuse him.

368
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,382
He’s been watching
a lot of Fox News.

369
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,999
Did you know that every day

370
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,086
Mexican gays sneak
into this country

371
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,471
and unplug our
brain-dead ladies?

372
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,089
We have to take in
Mr. Brockman.

373
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,506
He wouldn’t be
in this mess

374
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,604
if you hadn’t dumped
coffee on his lap.

375
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,180
Oh, sure, put down
a simple guy like me

376
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,345
who works hard
and plays by the rules.

377
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,024
Dad, you barely
go to work at all.

378
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,313
And you’re constantly
flouting the law.

379
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,437
I’m willing to change my mind
and that makes me great.

380
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,654
You can stay.

381
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,113
But you have to give us
an 8X10 for our wall

382
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,204
of Casual Acquaintances
Who Came to Stay For A While.

383
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,493
Apu sang a song.

384
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,954
What are you gonna do?

385
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:41,288
<i>TV ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i>Can 15 strippers</i>
<i>run their own airline?</i>

386

390
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,215
What a great show.

391
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,182
Real people
with real problems.

392
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,183
(sighs)

393
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,434
(clicks)

394
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,225
This is Fox News
with the latest liberal outrage.

395
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,980
It seems liberals want
to give NASA the right

396
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,863
to abort space missions
whenever they feel like it.

397
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,231
Liberals...

398
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,187
I hate them so much.

399
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,648
One thing I’ve always wondered,

400
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,988
how can Fox News
be so conservative

401
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,413
when the Fox network
keeps airing raunchy shows?

402
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,582
They don’t fit together.

403
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,450
-(remote clicks)
-Whoo-hoo!

404
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,036
<i>Liberals hate families.</i>

405
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,161
-Liberals...
-(remote clicks)

406
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,207
Whoo-hoo!

407
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,500
Liberals. Whoo-hoo!

408
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,213
Liberals.
Whoo-hoo!

409
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,503
Liberals. Whoo-hoo!

410
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,336
Liberals.
Whoo...!

411
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,011
Fox deliberately runs shows
that will earn them huge fines

412
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,340
which are then funneled
through the FCC

413
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,585
straight to
the Republican party.

414
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,716
Everybody in the media knows it,

415
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,142
but no one has the guts
to say it.

416
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,850
Not true.
You’ve got the guts,

417
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,350
and I’ve got a web cam.

418
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,022
This time you can
tell the truth.

419
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,270
And swear like a lumberjack
who hacked off a leg.

420
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,442
Let’s do it.

421
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,771
-(clicks remote)
-...hoo!

422
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,106
Whoo-hoo?

423
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,151
Liberals?

424
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,403
Whoo-hoo?

425
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,823
Here we go.

426
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,828
Four, three, two...

427
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,951
Good evening.

428
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,247
Thank you for inviting me
into your laps.

429
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,711
Friends, the press and the
government are in bed together

430
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,042
in an embrace
so intimate and wrong,

431
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,917
they could spoon
on a twin mattress

432
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,464
and still have room
for Ted Koppel.

433
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:13,467

434
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,590

00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,257

00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,216

Galdarn it!

449
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,003

451
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,666
I could Dracula bite him.

00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,299
Actually, Krusty and I’ve
been working on a plan

454
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,425
to take out Brockman.

455
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,431
You want to start?

456
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,932
No, why don’t you start?

457
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,683
Oh, but you’re
so good at starting.

458
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,715
You really think so?

459
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,098
-Oh, I know so.
Go on.
-All right.

460
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:08,185
Do you think there’s something
going on between those two?

461
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,572
To find out, I could
turn myself into a bat

462
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,229

463
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,817
Oh, you couldn’t even get
our pizza orders right.

464
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:18,453
Every order is half this,
half that, it’s confusing!

465
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:26,081
Kent, your righteous political
commentary rocks.

466
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,875
Yeah, you know how many stars
out of five I gave

467
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,419
the YouTube of your webcast?
Five!

468
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,883
And I never give five.

469
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,093
It’s true, he never does.

470
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,304
Mr. Brockman,
you’re a huge hit.

471
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,144
Really?
How wide is the web?

472
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,679
-World.
-Wow.

00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,887

00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,848
Hmph.

00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,950
I held out as long as I could!

480
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,333
I guess there’s just no place
for truth and bravery

481
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,911
in today’s media.

482
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,666
True, but there’s room for
the truth in this household.

483
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,842
Do you want to hear something
really bad

484
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,209
Kent told me
about the Fox network?

485
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,336
Of course.

486
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,092
Gosh, Dad,
your hands are shaking.

487
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,434
I know.

488

’Cause this one’s
really, really bad.

489
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,974
