1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,839
The Simpsons.

2
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,415
Looks like you
got a leak.

3
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,934
Could you start
fixing it pretty soon?

4
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,478
The basement is
getting awfully flooded

5
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,170
and I think
the cat's down there.

6
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,465
Yeah, I probably won't be able

7
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,468
to get the parts I need
for two... three weeks.

8
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,804
And that's if I order them
today, which I won't.

9
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,930
Oh, dear.

10
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,019
Emergency call.
Gotta go.

11
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,979
What should we do
until you get back?

12
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,063
Put a pan down there.

13
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,321
Oh, it didn't work.

14
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,201
Lousy traffic jams.

15
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,246
The traffic report will
get me out of this one.

16
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,332
This is Arnie Pie.

17
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,875
Looks like we got
a little accident

18
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,210
that's backing
traffic up

19
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,504
as far as
this reporter can see.

20
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,307
Hi, Dad.

21
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:49,275
Hey, how come you guys got
such great parking places?

22
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,111
It's a secret.

23
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,194
Shh! Shut up.

24
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:04,082
All right, Econo-save,
you just made the list.

25
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,964
Hey, will you guys
help me fix my...

26
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:17,011
Hey, how come you guys
got better chairs than me?

27
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,263
It's a secret.

28
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,722
Shh! Shut up.

29
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,647
Hey, you guys want
to go bowling tonight?

30
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,730
Nah, we're busy.

31
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,525
Yeah, we got things to do.

32
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,485
Like what?

33
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,945
It's a secret.

34
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,073
Shut up.

35
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,411
So anyway, Lenny and Karl
are never around on Wednesdays,

36
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,847
and they don't tell me
where they go.

37
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,372
It's like a conspiracy.

38
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,415
A conspiracy, eh?
You think they might be involved

39
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,668
in the Kennedy assassination
in some way?

40
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,546
I do now.

41
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,941
Anyway, I'm going to follow them
tonight and see where they go.

42
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,342
Oh, Homer, don't start
stalking people again.

43
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,636
It's so illegal.

44
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,513
Remember when you were stalking.

45
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,116
Charles Kuralt because you
thought he dug up your garden?

46
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,975
Well, something did.

47
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,768
I don't want you
stalking anyone tonight.

48
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,729
Oh, okay, have it
your own way, Marge.

49
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,356
I'll be back in a minute.

50
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,526
I'm going outside...

51
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,819
to...

52
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,362
stalk...

53
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,948
Lenny and Karl...

54
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,469
All I had to do is
follow the yellow drip road.

55
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,644
There's our
secret meeting place.

56
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,188
- Yes, let's go inside.
- Sounds good.

57
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,569
Whoop.

58
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,913
I can see everything.

59
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,957
And they're none the wiser.

60
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,844
- An intruder.
- He will pay the ultimate price.

61
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,639
Yes, the ultimate price.

62
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,349
Get out of here.

63
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,270
I saw weird stuff

64
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,730
in that place last night.

65
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,107
Weird, strange, sick, twisted,

66
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,359
eerie, godless, evil stuff,

67
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,986
and I want in.

68
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,446
We don't know what
you're talking about, Homer.

69
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,674
And you can't join
the Stonecutters

70
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,533
because it's too exclusive.

71
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:47,704
Well, it was a real nice secret
organization we had once.

72
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,580
Stonecutters, eh?
How do I join?

73
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,708
There are only two ways
to gain membership.

74
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,251
Be the son of a Stonecutter...

75
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,544
Next.

76
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,004
Or save the life
of a Stonecutter.

77
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,922
Hey!

78
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,424
I saved your life.

79
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,427
That egg sandwich could have
killed you by cholesterol.

80
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,095
Forget it, Homer.

81
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,282
While it has been established
that eggs contain cholesterol,

82
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,118
it has not yet been proven conclusively
that they actually raise the level

83
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,811
of serum cholesterol
in the human bloodstream.

84
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:12,997
So one of those
Egg Council creeps

85
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,105
got to you too, huh?

86
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,982
You got it all wrong, Homer.

87
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,942
It's not like that.

88
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,404
You'd better run, egg!

89
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,698
Why don't people
like me, Marge?

90
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,743
Everyone likes you.
You're a wonderful person.

91
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,244
Why don't
those stupid idiots

92
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,038
let me in their crappy club
for jerks?

93
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,622
I'm sure it's nothing
personal, Homer.

94
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,291
It is.

95
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,626
It's been happening
to me all my life.

96
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,464
Hey, Billy! Hey, Joey!

97
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,883
Come on in.
There's plenty of room.

98
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,635
- Sorry. Not you, Homer.
- Why not?

99
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,640
But you let in Homer Glumplet.

100
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,727
It says "No Homers."

101
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,395
We're allowed
to have one.

102
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,524
I felt so left out.

103
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,109
Kids can be so cruel.

104
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,486
We can?

105
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,904
Thanks, Mom!

106
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,697
Ow, cut it out, Bart!

107
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,910
I'd give anything to get in
to the Stonecutters.

108
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:09,911
What do they do
there, Dad?

109
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,329
I'm a member.

110
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,748
What do they do?
What don't they do?

111
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,793
Oh, they do
so many things, they never stop.

112
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,712
Oh, the things they do there...
My stars!

113
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,148
You don't know
what they do there, do you?

114
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,006
Not as such, no.

115
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,424
I'm a Stonecutter.

116
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,259
Dad, remember
those self-hypnosis classes

117
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,220
we took to help
us ignore Grampa?

118
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,055
Do I ever.
It's five years later,

119
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,681
and I still think I'm a chicken.

120
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,934
- I'm a chicken, Marge.
- I know, I know.

121
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,936
Maybe we should be listening
to him, now.

122
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,354
I'm a member.

123
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,981
- Huh? What?
- What? Huh?

124
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,234
You're a member of
the Stonecutters, Grampa?

125
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,736
Oh, sure, let's see.

126
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,948
I'm an Elk, a Mason,
a communist.

127
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,992
I'm the president
of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance

128
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,577
for some reason.

129
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,996
Ah! Here it is!
The Stonecutters!

130
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,290
Oh! This is it!
My ticket in.

131
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:59,335
They have to let me join
if I'm the son of a member.

132
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,671
I'll take this
communist one too.

133
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,673
Coming through.
Can't throw me out.

134
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,508
My father's a member.

135
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,010
- I'm in. I'm in.
- Okay, okay. Homer, you're in.

136
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,096
Just don't point
that thing at me.

137
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,722
Ah, thanks, Lenny.

138
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,933
When am I going
to be initiated?

139
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,518
As soon as Number One gets here.

140
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,395
Number One?

141
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,356
What kind of stupid
wiener name is that?

142
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,860
Hello. My name is Number One.

143
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,779
And so forth.

144
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,173
We call each other by number,
not by name.

145
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,199
Carl is number 14.
I'm number 12.

146
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,784
Burnsie is number 29.

147
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,578
You outrank Mr. Burns here?

148
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,037
Sure, watch.

149
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,622
Hey, 29, get over here.

150
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,503
Thank you, sir.
May I have another?

151
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,008
Patience, Monty.

152
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,509
Climb the ladder.

153
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,888
Is he the leader?

154
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,264
Of this chapter.

155
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,658
There are chapters
all over the world.

156
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,392
And it has been foretold

157
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,394
that someday
a chosen one will...

158
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,980
Okay, okay. I didn't ask
for your life story.

159
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,736
Let the initiation begin.

160
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,490
All Stonecutters must take
the leap of faith.

161
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,783
If you survive
this five-story plunge,

162
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,327
your character will be proven.

163
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,872
Happy landings.

164
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,303
I think
I have to do it again.

165
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,430
My blindfold came off.

166
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,391
This ritual is called
"Crossing the Desert."

167
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,314
And this we call
"The Unblinking Eye."

168
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,737
Hey, have you ever noticed
that the "Crossing the Desert".

169
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,114
Is a lot like
"The Unblinking Eye"?

170
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,367
It's exactly like
"The Wreck of the Hesperus."

171
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,244
And now the final ordeal.

172
00:08:56,327 --> 00:09:00,248
"The Paddling of the
Swollen Ass with Paddles."

173
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,337
And by the sacred parchment,
I swear

174
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,131
that if I reveal the secrets
of the Stonecutters

175
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,883
may my stomach become bloated

176
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,554
and my head be plucked
of all but three hairs.

177
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,615
Um, I think he should have
to take a different oath.

178
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,641
Everyone takes
the same oath.

179
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,310
Welcome to the club,
number 908.

180
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,355
You have joined the Sacred Order
of the Stonecutters

181
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:27,608
who since ancient times have
split the rocks of ignorance

182
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,653
that obscure the light
of knowledge and truth.

183
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,947
Now let's all get drunk
and play ping-pong.

184
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,949
'Cause he's already
kind of heavy, you know, and...

185
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,871
Well, to be honest

186
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,499
I never got around to ordering
that part for you.

187
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,294
So it's still going
to be a couple of weeks.

188
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,837
Oh, really?

189
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,422
Yes.

190
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,881
Really?

191
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,341
Yes. Yes!

192
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,176
But what if I were
to shake your hand

193
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,344
in this wise?

194
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,221
Wah-wah-weh!

195
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,392
Whoa. I didn't realize
you were a member.

196
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,361
So long, suckers.

197
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,375
Same old space, huh, Dad?

198
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,295
Yep, but they gave me
these roller blades

199
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,964
so I can glide
to the front door.

200
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,382
Whoa. Whoa.

201
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,550
Whoa!

202
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,093
Whoa!

203
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,553
Sweet.

204
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,766
Jealous?

205
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,101
Well, no.
We've got the same chair.

206
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,770
You're jealous.

207
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,355
Your membership pack.

208
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,273
What's this?

209
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,984
Put that sticker on your car
so you won't get any tickets.

210
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,004
This other one keeps paramedics
from stealing your wallet

211
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,279
while they're
working on you.

212
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,156
Oh, and don't bother
calling 911 anymore.

213
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,491
Here's the real number.

214
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,704
I still don't believe

215
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,040
all the Founding Fathers
were Stonecutters.

216
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:09,001
That's because you trust
your stupid school books.

217
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,961
Here's what
really happened

218
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,005
at the signing of the
Declaration of Independence.

219
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,928
And a nation is born.

220
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,930
Now let us party

221
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,140
like 'twas 1799!

222
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,728
Quaff! Quaff! Quaff! Quaff!

223
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,897
Quaff! Quaff! Quaff! Quaff!

224
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,148
Quaff! Quaff! Quaff!

225
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,150
Please, sir,

226
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,735
you're destroying
my establishment.

227
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,278
We just created

228
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,988
the greatest
democracy on earth,

229
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,616
you low-life commoner!

230
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,020
You want to see how Davy Crockett
really died at the Alamo?

231
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,412
You must be 18.

232
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,957
Homer, a man who called himself
"you-know-who"

233
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,917
just invited you
to a secret "wink-wink"

234
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,711
at the "you-know-what."

235
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,505
You certainly are popular
now that you're a Stonecutter.

236
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,382
Oh, yeah.

237
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,760
"Beer busts, beer blasts,
keggers, stein hoists,

238
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,637
A.A. meetings,
beer night."

239
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,389
It's wonderful, Marge.

240
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:07,184
I've never felt so accepted
in all my life.

241
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,770
These people look deep
within my soul

242
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,230
and assign me a number

243
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,357
based on the order
in which I joined.

244
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,740
Who controls
the British crown?

245
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,075
Who keeps
the metric system down?

246
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,994
We do.

247
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,037
We do.

248
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,248
Who leaves Atlantis
off the maps?

249
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,459
Who keeps the Martians
under wraps?

250
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,002
We do.

251
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,212
We do.

252
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:39,633
Who holds back
the electric car?

253
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,386
Who makes Steve Guttenberg.

254
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,929
A star?

255
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,890
We do.

256
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,225
We do.

257
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,436
Who robs cave fish
of their sight?

258
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,438
Who rigs every Oscar night?

259
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,608
We do.

260
00:12:55,691 --> 00:13:00,404
We do!

261
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,739
Thank you.

262
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,657
Tonight we are here
to commemorate

263
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,660
our glorious society's
1,500th anniversary.

264
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,789
And in honor of this
momentous occasion,

265
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,248
we're having ribs.

266
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,545
Uh-oh. I need a bib.

267
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,172
If I slop any on my shirt,

268
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,135
I could lose the respect
of my beloved brethren.

269
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,802
So let us rejoice
and enjoy our meal

270
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,555
in the shadow of the hallowed
sacred parchment.

271
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,394
- Homer.
- Huh? Oh. Yeah.

272
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,188
- Thanks, Lenny.
- This is terrible.

273
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,857
This is just appalling and outrageous.

274
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,318
What? Did I miss something?

275
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,780
Oh, God!

276
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,032
No! Homer, no!
This is outrageous!

277
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,575
You can't do that. No!

278
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,410
You really are stupid!

279
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,377
And the official
Stonecutter underwear, too.

280
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,510
Please don't kick me out.

281
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,387
This society's everything
to me.

282
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,680
Please give me another chance.

283
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,723
I've learned my lesson!

284
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,725
I've learned my lesson!

285
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,436
That's it!

286
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,914
- How can we punish him further?
- Get him out.

287
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,065
- Oh. Sorry.
- Homer Simpson,

288
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:21,861
for your continuing
and baffling desecration

289
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,071
of our beloved sacred parchment,

290
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,282
you are hereby banished

291
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,033
from the Stonecutters
forever.

292
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,494
And as a final humiliation,

293
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,163
you must walk home naked,

294
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:36,750
dragging behind you
the Stone of Shame.

295
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:46,926
The mark!

296
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,554
Oh, that.

297
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,848
It's just a birthmark.

298
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,224
And I'll thank you
not to stare.

299
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,143
He's the chosen one.

300
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,648
You are the chosen one

301
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,484
whom the sacred parchment
prophesied

302
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,944
would lead us to glory!

303
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,738
Now, to the top

304
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,198
of Mount Springfield
for the coronation!

305
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,702
- Remove the Stone of Shame.
- Woo-hoo!

306
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:16,582
Attach the Stone of Triumph!

307
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,556
Wow.

308
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,516
Mental note: Don't overdo this.

309
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,316
Peekaboo!

310
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,782
I always wondered
if there was a god

311
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,283
and now I know.

312
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,743
There is,
and it's me.

313
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,286
You're not
a god, Homer.

314
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,497
Remember, Dad,
all glory is fleeting.

315
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,541
- So?
- Beware the Ides of March.

316
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,752
- No.
- Dad, I know you think you're happy now,

317
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,420
but it's not gonna
last forever.

318
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,297
- Everything lasts forever.
- Don't you see?

319
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,049
Getting what
you want all the time

320
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,944
will ultimately leave you
unfulfilled and joyless.

321
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,469
Remove the girl.

322
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,055
Dad, you're not
with your Stonecutters now.

323
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,258
There are no lackeys around
to carry out your every...

324
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,984
Another strike
for the chosen one!

325
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,819
- Hurrah!
- Whoo-hoo!

326
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,703
- Well, that's just an excellent break.
- Most assuredly.

327
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,371
- Absolutely.
- Whoo-hoo!

328
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,129
I'm out.

329
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,589
No, no, no,
no, Homer.

330
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,676
You have the royal,
um... sampler.

331
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,803
Oh, I win again, don't I?

332
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:53,887
Whoo-hoo.

333
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,976
You know, I think you guys
are letting me win.

334
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,730
No! No, no! No! No!

335
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,566
From now on, I want you
to be honest with me.

336
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,359
I mean, I'm not perfect, right?

337
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,870
Run.

338
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,729
The Grand Exalted
Leader requests

339
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,920
a moment of your time.

340
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,505
Class dismissed.

341
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,299
Yay!

342
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,134
Yay!

343
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,054
Lisa, you were right.

344
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,388
My happiness is fading.

345
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,640
You're experiencing
spiritual emptiness

346
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,309
because your power
has isolated you

347
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,727
from other human beings.

348
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,270
What do you mean, isolated?

349
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,192
Well, maybe you could reach
out to the community

350
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,526
and help other people.

351
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,072
Hmm, I could help others.

352
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,492
I'll get a bunch of monkeys,
dress them up,

353
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,244
and make them reenact the Civil War.

354
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,913
Dad, that doesn't
help people.

355
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,664
Couldn't hurt,

356
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,500
unless the monkeys
started hurting people,

357
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,627
which they almost
certainly would.

358
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,383
Brothers! Brothers!

359
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:19,139
Brothers, I've learned
a wonderful lesson.

360
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,934
Helping others
makes our own lives better

361
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,019
and makes us better people,

362
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,106
so instead of just shooting
pool and drinking beer,

363
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,150
let us Stonecutters
use what we have

364
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,860
to help the less fortunate.

365
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,241
He's gone mad with power

366
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,159
like that
Albert Schweitzer guy.

367
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,459
Whee!

368
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,297
Ooh, for the love of God!

369
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,133
Somebody get
the jaws of life!

370
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,512
Higher!

371
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,806
Higher!

372
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,183
Oh, I'll give you higher,
my filthy little urchin.

373
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:10,065
Oh. You've won this round...

374
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,575
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Simpson.

375
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,577
It looks so much better.

376
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,121
A beautiful sky blue.

377
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,042
You were right, Lisa.

378
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,212
I've never felt
so spiritually fulfilled.

379
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,007
And with my brothers,
the Stonecutters, behind me,

380
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,886
this is the beginning
of a better world for all of us.

381
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,763
- We got to kill him!
- Take it easy, Moe.

382
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,974
Let's hear from
the Stonecutter World Council

383
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,852
- before we act too rashly.
- Kill him!

384
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,520
- Kill him!
- Kill the fool!

385
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,105
Afraid I have to disagree

386
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,441
with Orville, Jack, and Mister.

387
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,860
Can't we just do something
to his voice box?

388
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,154
We might as well face the truth.

389
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:01,241
As long as we're Stonecutters,
he will control our lives.

390
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:06,371
Maybe, but maybe we don't want
to be Stonecutters no more.

391
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:14,421
Hey, this much better than
the old Stonecutter hall.

392
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,839
Silence!

393
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,467
I now call to order
the first meeting

394
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,470
of the Ancient Mystic Society
of...

395
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,804
No Homers.

396
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,893
Hey, fellas, can I join?

397
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,562
Sorry. No Homers.

398
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,025
Loyal Stonecutters!

399
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:38,403
Let us begin our reenactment
of the Battle of Gettysburg!

400
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,075
Homer, you can't
just keep hanging out

401
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,868
with these
colobus monkeys.

402
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,287
Somebody's going
to get parasites.

403
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:51,416
Oh, Marge, kids,
I miss my club.

404
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,503
Oh, Homie.

405
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:58,215
You know, you are a member
of a very exclusive club.

406
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,801
- The Black Panthers?
- No.

407
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,636
The Family Simpson,

408
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,389
which has just five members.

409
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,307
And only two of those members

410
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,892
have special rings.

411
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,686
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

412
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,855
I meant our wedding rings!

413
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,901
You know, Marge,
you're right.

414
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:21,363
The Simpson Family is
the best possible club

415
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,781
I could belong to.

416
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,829
Ow! Ah! Ack! Ah!

417
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,014
This club better
be worth it!

418
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,707
Ow! Ee! Ah!

419
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,292
All right, all right.

420
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,376
It's Lisa's turn.

421
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,514
Who controls
the British crown?

422
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,766
Who keeps
the metric system down?

423
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,979
We do, we do.

424
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,398
Who keeps Atlantis
off the maps?

425
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,983
Who keeps the Martians
under wraps?

426
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:02,529
We do, we do.

427
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:06,575
Who holds back
the electric car?

428
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,036
Who makes Steve Guttenberg.

429
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,954
A star?

430
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:15,000
We do, we do.

431
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,127
Who robs cave fish
of their sight?

432
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,254
Who rigs every
Oscar night?

433
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,591
We do.

434
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,635
We do!

435
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,179
Shut up!

436
