Uh-uh-uh-uh. Slowly.
Make me forget my troubles.

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,690
Oh, I hate this game.

346
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,120
Look at all this. The great food,
the party, the sunshine.

347
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,960
Pfft! Hard to believe one God
came up with all this.

348
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,990
Well, there's probably a lot of gods.

349
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,330
Yeah, and some of them's
gotta be chicks.

350
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,240
Yeah, with, like, a thousand boobs.

351
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,140
Woo-hoo!
That's the God I'm gonna worship.

352
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,050
Well, there's only one God for me,
your dad's old hunting trophy.

you might be...?

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,120
- I don't know, incurring God's wrath?
- Eh. God's cool.

357
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,380
See, I don't know that he is.

358
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,850
In the Bible, he's always smiting
and turning people into salt.

359
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,440
Oh, look.
God's giving us a little shower.

360
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,710
Everybody,
look at the much needed rain.

Thank you, God.

Wet and wonderful God...

...your flood has driven us

whatever point you had.

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,200
Dad, maybe you should stop praying.
See if that makes it happy.

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,190
This heretic has doomed us all.

375
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,110
Yeah. I say we skin him alive
and set him on fire.

God is capable of great anger
and great mercy...

...but mostly great anger.

00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,880
There are perfectly logical explanations
for everything that happened.

387
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,010
The bonfire sent soot into the air,
which created rain.

388
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,050
And with all the trees cut down,
a flood was inevitable.

389
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,110
Yeah. But what made the rain stop?
