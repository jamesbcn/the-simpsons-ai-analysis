{\an8}You fly halfway across the country
to sit in a boring church, not on Sunday.

Then you're stuck in a lousy hotel
for a whole weekend

or you do know, and you hate.

has a... [gags] ...cucumber in it.

And this one's in the Poconos,

And you're forced to do
all these preplanned activities,

64
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,921
like a zip line you're too fat to use.

65
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:38,592
And they have to bring in
a telephone bucket truck to get you down!

66
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:44,556
And at the after-wedding brunch,
everyone calls you Johnny Zipline.

[muffled] And they open the presents
in front of everybody.

68
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:51,480
So they all know from the online
registry, yours is the cheapest.

00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,291
Well, there is a bit of a story there.

172
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,002
A love story. Ooh!

173
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,295

["Endless Love" playing on TV]

177
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:21,726
[Willie] <i>I was working for Maisie's da,
harvesting peat in the peat bogs.</i>

178
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,771
[Maisie] <i>Burning peat is
what gives whiskey its distinctive flavor.</i>

179
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:28,358
<i>And Willie could sniff out
the best bogs of them all.</i>

180
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,026
And that's how we met.

181

186
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,333
<i>So we made plans to elope
and sail away together.</i>

187
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,545
<i>But when I waited at the docks,
she did nae show.</i>

188
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:52,465
<i>So I left for America alone and bitter.</i>

189
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:57,220
The reason I didn't show was my family
told me Willie was eaten by a sheep.

190
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:01,725
But when I saw your TikTok,
I knew my love was alive.

Now, it's like all our screaming
meant nothing.

Yeah. Well, everything I hate
about these things is coming true.

Well, your sister isn't best friends
with the school janitor,

208
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,031
so she went off to tour Edinburgh
on her own.

209
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,034
Okay, I rubbed the toe
of David Hume's statue.

with everything else in our marriage.

338
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:25,478
I don't care if our romance began
when we did it on a mini golf course.

339
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,522
It's still epic.

340
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:33,570
How epic would it be if we did it
on the best golf course in the world?

341
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,156
{\an8}You are so romantic.

342
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:40,035
{\an8}[shouting] Fore... [whispering] ...play.

343
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,204
{\an8}[both moaning, kissing]

344
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,333
I gotta get outta here and warn Willie

345
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,754
that girl's just marrying him
for his nose. Ugh!

346
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,259
Birdseed bags.

347
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,096
{\an8}Soap with Willie's face on it.
Sleep masks.

348
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,805
{\an8}Aha!

349
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:05,184
I, Groundskeeper Willie,
take you, Booze-maker Maisie...

350
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,520
- Stop the wedding! Stop the wedding!
- [crowd gasps]

351
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:11,483
What are you doing, boy?
Why don't you want Willie to be happy?

352
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,278
[grunts] I do. This girl doesn't love you.

353
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,158
Her family only brought you here
for your peat sniffing.

354
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,910
Pa, Hamish, Owen, can this be true?

355
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,620
Of course it's true.

356
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,497
You're just a nose to us.

357
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:31,002
We've got to compete
with all these celebrity booze brands.

358
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,963
From your tall, dark Clooneys
to your wee Danny DeVitos.

359
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,508
There's no room
for a passable entry-level scotch.

360
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:42,096
William, I didn't know about any of this.
I swear.

361
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:46,684
I'd love you even if you never sniffed
another bog as long as you lived.

362
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,103
I wish I could believe you.

363
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,772
I'll prove it.

364
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,982
- [shouts]
- [Willie grunts]

365
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,567
[crowd gasps]

366
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:58,029
[groans] You broke my sniffer.

367
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,864
You do love me.

368
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,158
Forever and a day. [shouts]

369
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,828
[grunts] I'll never smell nothing again.

370
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,330
[all] Aw.

371
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:11,417
I think I get it, Lisa.
I understand love now.

372
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,586
