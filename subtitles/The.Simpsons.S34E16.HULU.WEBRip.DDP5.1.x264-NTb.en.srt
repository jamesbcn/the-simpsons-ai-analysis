00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:52,337
Then you leave me one choice.

182
00:07:52,344 --> 00:07:54,424
Until you meet my demands,

183
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:57,615
I'm going to play this trumpet,
on which

184
00:07:57,722 --> 00:08:00,932
I have no formal training.

185
00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:02,568
(dissonant playing)

186
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:05,065
- Aah!
- Mr. Van Houten, if we,

187
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,370
uh, if we could just...

188
00:08:06,372 --> 00:08:08,982
Look, there's no need
for brass instruments.

189
00:08:08,977 --> 00:08:11,977
For 30 years,
we've been pleading with parents

190
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:13,493
to get more involved.

191
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:16,026
- What the hell were we thinking?
- (Marge grumbles)

192
00:08:22,104 --> 00:08:23,414
I know Kirk is angry,

193
00:08:23,406 --> 00:08:25,206
but I'm a little worried
this meeting

194
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,050
will go off the rails.

195
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,020
Marge, stop saying things.

196
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:31,188
I'm trying to think
of an amazing product

197
00:08:31,188 --> 00:08:32,988
that can get us out of debt.

198
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:34,832
Uh... um...

199
00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:37,469
Handgun Underpants?
Mm, no.

200
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:39,237
Uh, Bucket in a Box?

201
00:08:39,238 --> 00:08:41,478
Spoon 2.0?
Steak Bedazzler?

202
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:42,775
Oh...

203
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,979
(clears throat)
Yes, we are all here

204
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:48,363
because one lone parent
raised an issue

205
00:08:48,456 --> 00:08:50,626
that he thinks
is worth me missing

206
00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:52,528
the new Equalizer starring

207
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,372
that delightful Queen Latifah.

208
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:56,838
Kirk!
You, regrettably,

209
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,240
have the floor.

210
00:08:58,376 --> 00:08:59,646
We need to stop teaching

211
00:08:59,646 --> 00:09:03,516
that my great-grandfather's
gazebo was a disaster.

212
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,290
But it was,
and it was his fault.

213
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:09,702
His dying words were, "My bad."

214
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:11,499
So?
Why can't our kids learn

215
00:09:11,503 --> 00:09:13,543
about things that make
our town proud?

216
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,580
Like, how if you want
to make a right on red,

217
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:17,518
it's usually not a problem.

218
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,315
Why do we have to focus
on the bad stuff?

219
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,760
(indistinct chatter)

220
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:25,329
We completely disagree.

221
00:09:25,463 --> 00:09:29,343
It's essential that all of
Springfield's darkest chapters

222
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:31,478
be taught: the monorail,

223
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:32,776
Lady Gaga's visit,

224
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:34,979
and the gazebo collapse.

225
00:09:34,983 --> 00:09:37,863
If our kids aren't made to feel
ashamed of the past,

226
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:41,555
how will they learn
to be ashamed of the future?

227
00:09:41,563 --> 00:09:42,573
(indistinct chatter)

228
00:09:42,565 --> 00:09:43,925
Look at my son.

229
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:46,444
You think he needs
to feel worse about himself

230
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:49,309
than he already clearly does?
(grunts)

231
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,181
You are doing this to him!

232
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:54,194
(cheering)

233
00:09:54,288 --> 00:09:56,428
I agree with the bald lady.

234
00:09:56,425 --> 00:09:58,555
Why does history
have to be hurtful?

235
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,234
Every book about World War II

236
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,573
makes the Germans the bad guys.

237
00:10:02,672 --> 00:10:04,542
Stop teaching facts!

238
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:06,582
Historical guilt is everything.

239
00:10:06,713 --> 00:10:09,753
You snowflakes
are hurting our feelings.

240
00:10:09,853 --> 00:10:12,263
Those who cannot
remember the past

241
00:10:12,257 --> 00:10:13,987
are condemned to repeat it.

242
00:10:14,094 --> 00:10:17,274
On the other hand, those
who cannot remember the past

243
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:19,507
are condemned to repeat it.

244
00:10:19,606 --> 00:10:21,906
People, people, people!
People.

245
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,650
We are not
going to settle this tonight.

246
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:26,619
I move that we end this meeting

247
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,720
with everyone
angry and dissatisfied.

248
00:10:28,724 --> 00:10:30,134
All in favor?

249
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:31,626
ALL:
Boo!

250
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,800
Wonderful.
It's unanimous.

251
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,640
Mm.

252
00:10:34,736 --> 00:10:36,636
Dad, I know this
is a weird thing

253
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,780
for a son to say to his father,

254
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:40,707
but I'm proud of you.

255
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:43,345
You actually convinced people.

256
00:10:43,452 --> 00:10:44,622
I did?

257
00:10:44,756 --> 00:10:46,456
You the man, Kirk.

258
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,600
- I am?
- No, you the my man.

259
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:51,099
This marriage may have

260
00:10:51,101 --> 00:10:53,741
just got un-sexless.

261
00:10:54,776 --> 00:10:57,346
It's so sad when people
can't get along.

262
00:10:57,347 --> 00:10:59,587
It causes upsetment.

263
00:10:59,586 --> 00:11:01,786
Marge, people need to disagree

264
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,260
and have their voice
shouted over.

265
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:06,669
That's what democracy was.
Remember that?

266
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,806
But everyone in this country
is so divided.

267
00:11:09,806 --> 00:11:13,246
Where will all
this hostility lead?

268
00:11:14,114 --> 00:11:15,584
I'll tell you
where it leads, Homer.

269
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:18,794
Straight to the bank...
the money bank.

270
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:21,002
- (backboard clanks)
- This is the idea

271
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:23,225
- you've been looking for.
- It is?

272
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:26,012
What's the one thing
every American has in common?

273
00:11:26,005 --> 00:11:28,735
(gasps)
They're furious all the time

274
00:11:28,744 --> 00:11:30,384
about everything.

275
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,720
Ex-Shaq-ly.

276
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,756
Now, think... how can you
make money from that?

277
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:38,756
I know just what to do.

278
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,204
<i>Hurry up, everyone!</i>

279
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,339
My thing's coming on.

280
00:11:42,437 --> 00:11:45,207
The thing
I never told you about.

281
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,250
<i>Are you full of anger
at your kids' school</i>

282
00:11:47,347 --> 00:11:48,547
<i>or at life in general?</i>

283
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,020
<i>You know it.</i>

284
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:52,389
<i>Well, now you can express
your scalding hot rage</i>

285
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,930
<i>with the light-up "Me-Shirt."</i>

286
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:57,871
<i>Why, that's so obnoxious.
I love it.</i>

287
00:11:57,969 --> 00:12:00,169
<i>The Me-Shirt has dozens
of snappy slogans</i>

288
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:01,913
<i>tailor-made

289
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,910
<i>but deeply-held views.</i>

290
00:12:03,914 --> 00:12:06,324
<i>"Never Remember,"
"The Truth Will Make You Sad,"</i>

291
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:08,788
<i>and "Don't Teach on Me."</i>

292
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,530
<i>Plus, the copper-infused fiber
that powers the lights</i>

293
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:13,069
<i>gives you more energy</i>

294
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,695
<i>and pushes all the blood
to your face.</i>

295
00:12:15,704 --> 00:12:19,754
<i>I'll never look not angry again.</i>

296
00:12:19,846 --> 00:12:22,246
Wow, Dad, way to milk
the rage-bucks

297
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,690
out of the red hat crowd.

298
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:25,787
Well, I found it appalling.

299
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,831
We have a shirt for you, too.

300
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,696
<i>Oh, hi there.
You caught me wearing</i>

301
00:12:31,703 --> 00:12:33,443
<i>my carbon-neutral light-up shirt</i>

302
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:34,909
<i>with progressive slogans like:</i>

303
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:36,609
<i>"Shame On Us," "I Know Best,"</i>

304
00:12:36,613 --> 00:12:41,163
<i>and "Who farted? All the cows
raised by the beef industry!"</i>

305
00:12:41,155 --> 00:12:42,255
That's despicable.

306
00:12:42,257 --> 00:12:44,597
Though that fart slogan
makes a good point.

307
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:47,396
You're pitting people
against each other.

308
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,310
Lisa, that's what the T-shirt
industry has always done,

309
00:12:51,408 --> 00:12:53,248
ever since "I'm With Stupid."

310

"stupid" a chance to respond.

00:15:08,048 --> 00:15:09,988
Damn it, Gary,
it's just one thing.

358
00:15:10,086 --> 00:15:12,116
Fine.
Who gives a crap?

359
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:15,703
Wow.
I actually won something.

360
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:17,737
Let's get ready

361
00:15:17,735 --> 00:15:20,405
to meddle!

362
00:15:20,507 --> 00:15:22,807
(cheering)

363
00:15:22,812 --> 00:15:26,252
Oh. I'm getting
a sick feeling in my stomach.

364
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:29,321
Oh, don't worry so much, honey.

365
00:15:29,324 --> 00:15:32,104
People just want
to feel proud of our town.

366
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,967
And remember,
I'm still on the school board,

367
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:36,269
so I can be a guardrail

368
00:15:36,371 --> 00:15:39,111
to keep Kirk's
worst impulses in check.

369
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:42,351
I mean, how bad can it be?

00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,690
(bombastic music playing
over speakers)

371
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:53,011

all this happened

372
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:55,105

Homer, things are terrible

Kirk got a little bit

what the kids learn
and he went cuckoo with it,

401

and we helped him.

402
00:17:25,323 --> 00:17:26,993

00:17:36,311 --> 00:17:38,981
Great idea.
What's in it for me?

408
00:17:39,084 --> 00:17:41,764
Homer, what does it profit a man

409
00:17:41,856 --> 00:17:43,186
if he gains the world

410
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:45,532
but loses his soul?

411
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,400
Uh, he gains the world.

412
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,940
(gasps)
I got to put that on a shirt.

413
00:17:49,939 --> 00:17:51,479
D'oh...

414
00:17:55,717 --> 00:17:57,447
Hey there, great leader.

415
00:17:57,453 --> 00:18:00,633
You're looking especially
non-repulsive today.

416
00:18:00,627 --> 00:18:04,067
With great power comes great
"you have to like me."

Um, uh, e-excuse me.

420
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:12,692
Marge, my guardrail.
Have a seat.

421
00:18:14,855 --> 00:18:16,325
So, what's the good word?

422
00:18:16,325 --> 00:18:19,055
And I only want good words.

423
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,844
Ugh. I know you don't
want to hear it, Kirk,

424
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,340
but our schools are a disaster.

425
00:18:24,341 --> 00:18:26,041
Reading levels have plummeted

426
00:18:26,044 --> 00:18:28,984
because there are no books left
for kids to read.

427
00:18:29,084 --> 00:18:31,924
Sure, but those books
were bummers.

428
00:18:31,923 --> 00:18:33,233
They're not bummers,

429
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:35,155
they're the sum
of human knowledge.

430
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:38,202
You can't base
an entire society on ignorance

431
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:40,372
and forgetting the past.

432
00:18:40,373 --> 00:18:42,113
Hmm.

433
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,720
Marge, thank you
for telling me all this.

434
00:18:44,715 --> 00:18:46,275
Top-notch guardrailing.

435
00:18:46,284 --> 00:18:50,634
I know now this moment
calls for serious action.

436
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:53,299
Damn it.

437
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,439
(rock band playing)

438
00:18:55,436 --> 00:18:57,366
So how about this gazebo?

439
00:18:57,373 --> 00:19:00,283
It's twice as big
as the original...

440
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:02,789
which never existed.

441
00:19:02,885 --> 00:19:05,255

442
00:19:05,356 --> 00:19:08,096

443
00:19:08,095 --> 00:19:09,965
against history.

444
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:11,965
(cheering)

445
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:13,869
It's time to rock out

446
00:19:13,873 --> 00:19:15,913
with your Kirk out.

447
00:19:17,013 --> 00:19:20,353
The past never happened!

448
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:23,558
(whimpering)

449
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,770
(grunting)

450
00:19:29,104 --> 00:19:30,244
What is happening?

451
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:32,339
Uh, the electricity
running through

452
00:19:32,443 --> 00:19:34,783
everyone's copper T-shirts
has created

453
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,452
a massive electrical field

454
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:39,262
and a full-fledged
magnetic disturbance.

455
00:19:39,257 --> 00:19:40,827
Dumb it down for us.

456
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:42,157
Well, I just did.

457
00:19:42,163 --> 00:19:43,773
(stammers)

458
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:45,137

459
00:19:45,136 --> 00:19:47,876
Soup crackers!

460
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,405

461
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,397
(groans)

462
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:03,666
Attention, everyone.

463
00:20:03,673 --> 00:20:06,483
We learned something
very important today.

464
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:08,819
You can try to ignore history,

465
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:10,987
but not science.

466
00:20:10,987 --> 00:20:13,057
No matter how much we deny it,

467
00:20:13,158 --> 00:20:14,928
science is real,

468
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:17,629
and we must not anger her.

469
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,644
(all assenting)

470
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:27,494
