1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,300
Hmm.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,760
(yelling)

3
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:16,352
Ahh.

4
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:32,993
{\an8}(thudding)

5
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,660
{\an8}Did you hear that, Bart?

6
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:37,995
{\an8}Maybe it was
just the cat.

7
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,709
{\an8}No. She's sleeping with me.

8
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,459
{\an8}(meowing)

9
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,921
{\an8}(thudding)

10
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,841
{\an8}(groaning)

11
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,302
{\an8}Did you guys hear
something moving around

12
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,471
{\an8}in the attic last night?

13
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,089
{\an8}Attic? Oh, that's silly.

14
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,926
{\an8}(laughing)

15
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,765
{\an8}Seriously, though,
don't ever go up there.

16
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,098
{\an8}Homer, isn't it
about time for the--

17
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,354
{\an8}You know.

18
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,435
{\an8}Yeah, yeah.
I'll go feed it.

19
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,323
{\an8}<i>♪ Fish heads, fish heads ♪</i>

20
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,859
{\an8}<i>♪ Do, do, do, do,</i>
<i>do, do, do ♪</i>

21
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,317
{\an8}(whistling tune)

22
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,293
{\an8}(grunting, chewing)

23
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,332
{\an8}(Homer shuddering)

24
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,916
{\an8}(rattling and clanging)

25
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,708
(metal clanging)

26
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,884
(growling)

27
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,636
(whimpering)

28
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,259
-What's up there?
-Yeah, is it a monster?

29
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,256
-We have to know.
-Come on, what's the secret?

30
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,307
No more questions.

31
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,389
I work my butt off
to feed you four kids,

32
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,935
and all you do is--
What?

33
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:45,398
Three.
We have three kids, Homer.

34
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,570
Yeah.
Three nosy kids.

35
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,440
And you know
what happens to nosy kids

36
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,607
who ask too many questions?

37
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:52,824
-No, what?
-What does happen?

38
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,494
-Does something happen?
-What happens?

39
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,623
(thunder rumbling)

40
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,120
LISA: Hurry up.

41
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,752
Mom and Dad
will be home soon.

42
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,002
{\an8}-Wah!
-Oof.

43
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:20,267
The unsold copies
of Dad's autobiography.

44
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,098
Oh, my God,
Bart, look.

45
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,563
-(chains rattling)
-(gasping)

46
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,068
-(thunder rumbling)
-(whimpering)

47
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,530
(ghoulish laughter)

48
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,992
{\an8}(screaming)

49
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,865
LISA: Bart, do you think
it's safe?

50
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,080
BART: I don't care.
I can't breathe in here.

51
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,291
(Maggie sucking)

52
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,870
(gasping and coughing)

53
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,752
See, Marge,
who needs a car wash

54
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,884
when you can just
drive around in the rain?

55
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,261
BOTH: Mom, Dad, we saw something in
the attic! We saw something in the attic!

56
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,628
You went into the attic?

57
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,045
(gasping)

58
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,683
I'm very disappointed
and terrified.

59
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,144
Oh, my God, Marge.

60
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,393
It's escaped.

61
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,476
(footsteps)

62
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,481
(door opening)

63
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,073
(touch tones)

64
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,279
Yes, doctor.

65
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,778
It's what we've
always feared.

66
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,360
It's loose.
Hugo is loose.

67
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,156
See you soon.

68
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,199
Who or what is Hugo?

69
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,453
(sighing)
I'm afraid we haven't been

70
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,995
entirely honest with you, Bart.

71
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,579
You see...
you have a brother.

72
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,995
So, I have two brothers?

73
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,343
Lisa, please.

74
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,338
Yes, Bart, you have
a twin brother.

75
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,840
You see, when you
were born, there was...

76
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,553
an irregularity.

77
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,053
HIBBERT:
A monstrous irregularity.

78
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,295
(screaming)

79
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,466
Yes, I remember
Bart's birth well.

80
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:49,266
You don't forget a thing
like... Siamese twins.

81
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,614
{\an8}I believe they prefer to be
called "conjoined twins."

82
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,570
And hillbillies prefer to be
called "sons of the soil,"

83
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,822
but it ain't
gonna happen.

84
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,363
Now, normally the birth
of Siamese twins

85
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,237
is a joyous occasion,
but unfortunately

86
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,115
one of them was pure evil.

87
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,134
I think I'll
bottle feed that one.

88
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,924
HIBBERT:
<i>A routine soul smear</i>

89
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,507
<i>confirmed the presence</i>
<i>of pure evil.</i>

90
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,142
<i>It was then I knew</i>
<i>the only option</i>

91
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,299
<i>was to separate you two</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

92
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,269
You'll both need
to sign these.

93
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,889
(chuckles)

94
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,443
<i>But what to do</i>
<i>with poor Hugo?</i>

95
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,525
<i>Too crazy for boys town,</i>

96
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,950
<i>too much of a boy</i>
<i>for crazy town--</i>

97
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,609
<i>the child was an outcast.</i>

98
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,988
So we did the only
humane thing.

99
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,405
We chained Hugo up
in the attic like an animal

100
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,914
and fed him a bucket
of fish heads once a week.

101
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,537
It saved our marriage.

102
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,673
You expect me
to believe all this?

103
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,960
If any of it was true,

104
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,553
{\an8}wouldn't I have
a big, hideous scar-- Wha!

105
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,589
We've got to find Hugo.

106
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,133
We'll search out
every place

107
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,136
a sick, twisted, solitary
misfit might run to.

108
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,508
I'll start with
Radio Shack.

109
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,974
Right.

110
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,135
Bart, you stay home
and tape the hockey game.

111
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,687
(rustling)

112
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:22,156
You're here...
aren't you?

113
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,568
Yes, Bart.
I never left you.

114
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,788
What do you want
from me?

115
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,499
You'll see...
after the surgery.

116
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,210
(screaming)

117
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,251
(thunder crashes)

118
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,504
-You're crazy.
-Am I?

119
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,086
Well, perhaps we're all
a little crazy.

120
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,302
I know I am.

121
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,881
I went mad
after they tore us apart,

122
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:45,596
but I'll be sane
once I sew us back together.

123
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,561
But you'll kill both of us.

124
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,679
No. It's easy.
Look, I've been practicing.

125
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,728
I made a pigeon-rat.

126
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,569
Well, let's get started.

127
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,940
You want to be
on the right or the left?

128
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,237
-(screams)
-Hugo, stop!

129
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,361
Huh?

130
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,487
(laughing)

131
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,333
There, there, Hugo,
I understand.

132
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,499
All those years
caged up in here--

133
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,498
why, you've probably
never even seen

134
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,870
your own face
in the mirror, have you?

135
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:15,877
Here.

136
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:17,754
Hmm?

137
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,591
(grunting)

138
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,591
We think we saw Hugo
at the airport.

139
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,383
He was boarding
a plane to Switzerland--

140
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,467
Oh.

141
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,971
You know,
isn't it interesting

142
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,137
how the left,
or sinister twin

143
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,846
is invariably
the evil one.

144
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,016
I had this theory that--

145
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,645
Wait a minute.

146
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:42,531
Hugo's scar is
on the wrong side.

147
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,610
He couldn't have been
the evil left twin.

148
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:50,616
That means the evil twin
is and always has been... Bart.

149
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,961
Oh, don't look so shocked.

150
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,840
Well... chalk this one up
to carelessness on my part.

151
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,630
But I think there's a way
to set everything right.

152
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,505
(laughing)

153
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,219
Care for a drumstick, Hugo?

154
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,015
(noisily chomping)

155
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,517
Mom, Hugo 's
eating his napkin.

156
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,152
(laughing)

157
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,439
MARGE: He's so cute.

158
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,153
{\an8}Hey, can I have
some turkey?

159
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,193
No. You finish
your fish heads.

160
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,187
Then we'll talk.

161
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,164
This tooth will be perfect
for my science project.

162
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,293
Science has already
proven the dangers

163
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,376
of smoking, alcohol
and Chinese food

164
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,132
but I can still ruin
soft drinks for everyone.

165
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,927
Hey, Lis, check out
my science project.

166
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,220
Ow! What's that
supposed to prove?

167
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,644
That nerds
conduct electricity.

168
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,642
Ow!

169
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,055
(sizzling)

170
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,436
Ow!
Stupid, Bart.

171
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,653
{\an8}(electrical crackling)

172
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,290
Oh, boy, mold.

173
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,198
That's science fair pay dirt.

174
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,500
Hmm.

175
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,043
Looks about the same.

176
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,254
Ah.

177
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,247
Oh.

178
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,261
(gasping)

179
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,091
Tiny little people?

180
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,257
My God!
I've created life.

181
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,806
MARGE: Lisa! Breakfast!
We're having waffles!

182
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,095
Ooh, waffles.

183
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,736
Hey, these aren't waffles.

184
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,738
These are just
square pancakes.

185
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,030
I'm sorry, honey.

186
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,323
The waffle iron's
in the shop.

187
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,827
That waffle iron's been
in the shop forever.

188
00:08:56,911 --> 00:09:00,371
So, how are my little
stone age tub dwellers?

189
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,246
Oh, my gosh.

190
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,293
They're evolving so quickly.

191
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,877
They've already reached
the Renaissance.

192
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,212
Wait. One of them
is nailing something

193
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,967
to the door
of the cathedral.

194
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,089
(gasping)
I've created Lutherans.

195
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,983
Wow. It's almost like
seeing into the future.

196
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,694
Hey, what is this goo?
You trying to grow a friend?

197
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,565
Hey, you built a model city.

198
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,993
Is that the school?

199
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,411
Whoops, my finger slipped.

200
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,319
Oops, my finger slipped.

201
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,368
Oops, my finger slipped.

202
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,490
Bart, stop it!

203
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,117
(laughs)

204
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,210
-(sirens wailing)
-(screaming)

205
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,463
Oh, my poor little guys.

206
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,666
That Bart is so rude.

207
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,506
(snoring)

208
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,842
{\an8}(small explosion)

209
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,536
What the heck?

210
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,079
Ah!

211
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,122
Ow!

212
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,464
(grunts and groans)

213
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,920
(machine gun fire)

214
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,041
(groans)

215
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,836
(groaning)

216
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,715
Your micro-jerks
attacked me.

217
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,722
Well, you practically
destroyed their whole world.

218
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,515
You can't protect
them every second.

219
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,769
Sooner or later you'll let your guard down
and then flush.

220
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,272
It's toilet time
for tiny town.

221
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,645
(sighs loudly)

222
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,572
(whirring hum)

223
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,489
Aah!

224
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,536
(grunts)

225
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,583
It worked!
The debigulator worked!

226
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,576
(trumpet sounds)

227
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,997
ALL: Hail, Lisa.

228
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:15,257
Welcome to our world,
most gracious Lisa.

229
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,931
Your world is incredible,

230
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,339
and you speak English.

231
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,757
We have listened to you speak

232
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,505
since the dawn of time,
o, creator

233
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,227
and we have learned
to imatoot you exarktly.

234
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,484
LISA:
You think I'm God?

235
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,732
But of course.

236
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,574
You look down on us
from heaven.

237
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,859
You gave us life

238
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,572
and only your
divine intervention

239
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,493
can save us
from the devil.

240
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,071
The devil?
What devil?

241
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:42,236
The one you call "Bart."

242
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:45,536
(all gasping and hissing)

243
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:48,371
Oh, no, no, no, no,
you don't understand.

244
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,877
Bart's just my brother.

245
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,419
The devil is
your brother?

246
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,673
(gasping, murmuring)

247
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:58,715
I must say we find
that quite perplexing.

248
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,761
Uh, God, hi.
Bill Watson.

249
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,175
I, uh, live
in the Clark building.

250
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,473
I have a question.
If you're so good,

251
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,677
why do you allow
bad things to happen?

252
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,597
Why am I so fat?

253
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,106
MAN: Why do bad things
happen to good people?

254
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,978
(overlapping dialog)

255
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,975
Listen, I can take care
of everything.

256
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,777
All you have to do
is unshrink me.

257
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,241
Unshrink you?

258
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,030
Well, that would require
some sort of a rebigulator

259
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,445
which is a concept
so ridiculous

260
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,453
it makes me want to laugh
out loud and chortle,

261
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,785
uh, but not at you,
o holiest of gods

262
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,372
with the wrathfulness
and the vengeance

263
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,497
and the blood-rain

264
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,083
and the hey, hey, hey,
it hurts me.

265
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,548
Look, the destroyer!
He returns!

266
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,755
(screaming)

267
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,089
Help!

268
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,764
WOMAN: Save us, Lisa!

269
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,302
Bart, no!

270
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,892
First rate work, Bart.

271
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,935
{\an8}This universe
you've created

272
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,809
{\an8}is even more impressive than
Martin's milk carton ukulele.

273
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,067
Willie, you can throw out
the other projects.

274
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,529
We have a winner.

275
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,447
Principal Skinner, wait!

276
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,450
I created the universe!

277
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,792
Give me the gift certificate!

278
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,288
Ah, great.

279
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,499
I'm stuck in this lousy tub
for the rest of my life.

280
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,751
Shouldn't you people
be groveling?

281
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:14,884
(crowd murmurs in agreement)

282
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,880
And bring me some shoes.
Nice ones.

283
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,673
MAN: She'll want socks too.
I'll get socks.

284
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,274
Ah, the old fishin' hole.

285
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,060
So peaceful and relaxing.

286
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,694
Doesn't even matter
if I catch a single fish.

287
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,153
(sighs)

288
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,784
Come on, you stupid fish!
Take the bait!

289
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,701
Don't make me come down there.

290
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,913
What the--
Son of a--

291
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,797
Oh, my God!

292
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,552
Space aliens!
Don't eat me!

293
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,594
I have a wife and kids!

294
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,218
-Eat them!
-Silence!

295
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,354
We are travelers

296
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,220
from a certain
nearby ringed planet

297
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,517
whose name we'd prefer
not to mention.

298
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,851
My name is Kang.

299
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,647
And this is
my sister Kodos.

300
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,900
MALE VOICE:
Hello.

301
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,572
(gulps) I suppose
you want to probe me.

302
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,531
Well, might as well
get it over with.

303
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,702
Stop. We have reached
the limits

304
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,991
of what rectal probing
can teach us.

305
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,405
This is a mission of conquest.

306
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,004
Take us to your leader.

307
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,709
I guess you mean
President Clinton.

308
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,249
-(zipping)
-He usually hangs around Washington, D.C.

309
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,463
President Clin-ton.

310
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,924
Excellent.

311
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,724
Except... um, there's
this election next week

312
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,968
so after that,
it might not be him anymore.

313
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,970
It might be what's-his-name,
uh, mumbly-Joe...

314
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,675
I saw him on TV the other--

315
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,766
Uh... Bob Dole.

316
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:59,022
Hmm... an election.
That complicates matters.

317
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,776
Set grid coordinates
for Bob Dole.

318
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,358
Well, night everybody.

319
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,656
-Good night, senator.
-Good luck next week.

320
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,409
What?

321
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,620
Bob Dole doesn't need this.

322
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,746
Wha-wha-what's happening?

323
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,083
Is it noon already?

324
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,757
What the hell is this,
some kind of tube?

325
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,184
Hey--

326
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,432
Well, thanks for taking care
of Dole for me.

327
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,474
Hey!

328
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,227
(gurgling)

329
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,269
(whimpering)

330
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,565
Commence
bio-duplication.

331
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,243
(electronic humming)

332
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,040
Oh, no.
Aliens...

333
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,828
bio-duplication,
nude conspiracies.

334
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,623
Oh, my God!
Lyndon Larouche was right!

335
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,207
KODOS' VOICE: What?
Are you still here?

336
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,882
I'm afraid we'll have
to dispose of you.

337
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,876
No! No! What are you
spraying me with?

338
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,928
KANG'S VOICE: Rum. So no one
will believe your story.

339
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,523
Aah!

340
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,558
And don't come back.

341
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,141
(screaming)

342
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,188
<i>Kent Brockman here</i>
<i>with "Campaign '96."</i>

343
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,612
<i>America flips a coin.</i>

344

<i>At an appearance this morning</i>

That's slick Willie for you.

352
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,918
Always with the smooth talk.

353
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,343
Marge! Marge!

354
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,091
There I was,
I had just caught

355
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,222
the largest fish
you'd ever seen,

356
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,929
when I was abducted
by a flying saucer.

357
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,851
Sure you were, rummy.

358
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,179
(gasps)
That's one of the creatures!

359
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,135
<i>Senator Dole, why should</i>
<i>people vote for you</i>

360
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,135
<i>instead of</i>
<i>President Clinton?</i>

361
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,807
KANG: <i>It makes no difference</i>
<i>which one of us you vote for.</i>

362
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:06,396
<i>Either way,</i>
<i>your planet is doomed.</i>

363
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,533
<i>Doomed!</i>

364
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,570
<i>Well, a refreshingly</i>
<i>frank response there</i>

365
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,204
<i>from Senator Bob Dole.</i>

366
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,621
These candidates make me want
to vomit in terror.

367
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,581
I've got to stop them.

368
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:22,001
Ladies and gentlemen,
73-year-old candidate Bob Dole.

369
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,922
(cheering)

370
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,881
Abortions for all.

371
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,671
(crowd booing)

372
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,046
Very well.

373
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,052
No abortions for anyone.

374
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,514
(crowd booing)

375
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,675
Hmm.

376
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,683
Abortions for some,

377
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,095
miniature American flags
for others.

378
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,444
(crowd cheering)

379
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,320
Fooling these earth voters
is easier than expected.

380
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,228
Yes. All they
want to hear

381
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,737
are bland pleasantries

382
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,448
embellished by
an occasional

383
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:54,198
saxophone solo
or infant kiss.

384
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,279
Uh, Mr. President, sir,

385
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,867
people are becoming
a bit confused

386
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,373
by the way you
and your opponent are,

387
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,415
well, constantly
holding hands.

388
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,710
We are merely exchanging
long protein strings.

389
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,455
If you can think
of a simpler way,

390
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,756
I'd like to hear it.

391
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,599
My fellow Americans,

392
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:23,771
as a young boy I dreamed
of being a baseball.

393
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:28,482
But tonight, I say we must
move forward, not backward,

394
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,775
upward, not forward,

395
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,989
and always twirling,
twirling, twirling

396
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,372
towards freedom.

397
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,238
(cheering)

398
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,252
Stop! Those candidates
are phonies!

399
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,003
(crowd gasping)

400
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,335
(groans)

401
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,919
You heard me.
They're alien replicons

402
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,165
from beyond the moon.

403
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,587
(derisive snorting)

404
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,348
(grunting)

405
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,929
Don't forget
your stinking flag.

406
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,095
Oh, why won't anyone
believe my crazy story?

407
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,145
-(clanking)
-Ow!

408
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,274
(gasps)

409
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,572
Hold on, guys.
I'll help you.

410
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,789
Oh, no, am I still here?

411
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,209
I don't want to serve out
my term naked in a tube.

412
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,539
I am so mad at the secret
service right now.

413
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,535
Hey, who the hell
are you?

414
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,456
I'm Homer Simpson, sir.

415
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,625
And I'm going to get you
back to Washington

416
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,344
before it's too late.

417
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,597
You know, senator, being in
suspended animation

418
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,048
gave me time to think.

419
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,058
Partisan politics
are tearing our country apart.

420
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,731
You got a point
there, Bill.

421
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,809
If you and I are going to whip these
one-eyed space fellas,

422
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,555
we're gonna have to
set aside our differences.

423
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:53,816
Together we can lead America
into a new golden age.

424
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,241
Friend, you got a deal.

425
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,949
Homer, let us out.

426
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,319
It's time to tear those
aliens a third corn chute.

427
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,157
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

428
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,042
Num, num, num, num... there.

429
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:06,958
D'oh!

430
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,666
Oh, no.
What have I done?

431
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,843
What am I doing?
What will I do?

432
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,422
(engine revs)

433
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,926
KANG: The politics
of failure have failed.

434
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,139
We need to make them
work again.

435
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,220
Tomorrow when you are sealed
in the voting cubicle,

436
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:28,266
vote for me, Senator Ka--
Bob Dole.

437
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,732
(applause)

438
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:35,233
I am looking forward to
an orderly election tomorrow

439
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,687
which will eliminate
the need

440
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,447
for a violent bloodbath.

441
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,278
(applause)

442
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,704
(Homer yelling)

443
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,294
(footsteps)

444
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,370
America, take a good look
at your beloved candidates.

445
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,706
They're nothing
but hideous space reptiles.

446
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,713
(crowd gasping
and screaming)

447
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,090
It's true.
We are aliens.

448
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,256
But what are you going
to do about it?

449
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,885
It's a two-party system.

450
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,022
You have to vote
for one of us.

451
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,389
He's right.
This is a two-party system.

452
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,056
Well, I believe I'll vote
for a third party candidate.

453
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,515
Go ahead--
throw your vote away.

454
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,607
(both laughing)

455
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:30,156
All hail President Kang.

456
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,930
Ow!

457
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,260
I don't understand
why we have to build a ray gun

458
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,015
to aim at a planet
I never even heard of.

459
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,768
Don't blame me.
I voted for Kodos.

460
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:51,771
