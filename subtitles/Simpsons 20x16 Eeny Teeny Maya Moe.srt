1
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,610
D'oh!

2
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,187
Hmm.

3
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:25,456
Mmm.

4
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,574
ANNOUNCER 1: Oh! You hate to see this.

5
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,009
I love to see this!

6
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,011
Now the other players are joining in.

7
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,180
ANNOUNCER 2: Uh-oh!
Someone could lose a tooth!

8
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,717
This is no time to pat the bunny, Maggie.

9
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,319
Daddy's watching a very important

10
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:56,022
Mid-Atlantic Hockey League
Conference semi-final do-over game.

11
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:58,625
ANNOUNCER 1: As we enter
the seventh amazing overtime,

12
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,794
the members of Sesame Street on Ice...

13
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,497
...wait impatiently
to begin their matinee performance.

14
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,166
Hold the Black Label, Mabel!

15
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:09,936
The Utica Mohawks'Pete Mavroudis
has broken through the 'Topes defense!

16
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,237
Stop them, Babando!

17
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:14,274
He winds up for the shot
and Delacroix slides in front!

18
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,810
You're supposed to be spending time
with your daughter!

19
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,448
I will when it's not sports season!
I just want to know how the game ends!

20
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:27,120
And this game is over! Unbelievable!
You'll never see anything like that again!

21
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,321
So that will do it,

22
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:32,158
from Wayne Buckhorn, Jean-Pierre
Petomane, and me, Don Jacque LaLonde,

23
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,462
here at Utica 's Kill-Kwik
Rat Poison Arena!

24
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:36,896
What's the score?

25
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:39,165
Now stay tuned for
Picking the Perfect Apple.

26
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,900
It's already in progress.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,969
D'oh! The score, damn you!

28
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,838
Once again, today's final score...

29
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,573
Yeah?
...is already in the books.

30
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:47,674
Good night!

31
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,868
Oh! I will never know the score!

32
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,048
You want to know the score?
I'll tell you the score!

33
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:58,151
Marge. This is a definite high point
for our marriage.

34
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,652
Here's the score, mister.

35
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:03,023
Yes?
- Your daughter barely knows who you are!

36
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,524
That's ridiculous.

37
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:08,194
Who's your daddy, Maggie?
Who's your daddy?

38
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,987
He is pretty good with her.
- Oh!

39
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,412
Hmm.

40
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,251
Look, Marge! It's just what you want,
me spending the day with Mugsy.

41
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,352
Maggie!

42
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:36,756
Marge, you're not naggy.
You just set the bar impossibly high.

43
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,725
Can you at least bring
a sweater for Maggie?

44
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,460
Impossibly high.

45
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,264
Now, let's get started on the greatest
daddy /daughter day ever!

46
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,667
Hmm?

47
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,072
Hmm.

48
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,107
Not even heated up. Typical dog.

49
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,550
This is it, Maggie.

50
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,135
The place where Daddy goes every morning.

51
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,125
Now, you learn your numbers
from these billiard balls...

52
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:17,835
...while Daddy gets happier and happier
and then sadder and sadder.

53
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,469
Moe, what are you doing?
- I'm spiffing up the place.

54
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,171
Jeez. Can't a guy clean his bar
for the first time ever...

55
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:28,841
...without people making polite inquiries?

56
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,071
Huh. I got a window here.

57
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Ooh!

58
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:41,521
Hey, Maggie could play out there
while I watch her from in here.

59
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,661
What do you say, Maggie?

60
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:47,116
Ah! Her first enabling.

61
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,829
HOMER: Hi, Maggie!
CARL: Up here, beautiful!

62
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,665
LENNY: Yo, Mag!
- It's me, Uncle Barney!

63
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,268
Remember? I taught you your ABCs.

64
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:58,860
A, B, P, K...

65
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,972
R...

66
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,744
So, I suppose you guys are still wondering
why I'm cleaning the bar?

67
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,781
Hey, Maggie! Maggie, Maggie, Maggie!
- Hello, Maggie! Hello, Maggie!

68
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,941
Hey, Maggie!
Maggie, look at my face.

69
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,055
It all began about a month ago.

70
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,524
It was a typical Friday night.

71
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:22,695
Me surfing the net at the public library
with occasional drinking fountain breaks.

72
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:26,110
Ah! Just how I like it, warm and rusty.

73
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,471
Ooh!

74
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,572
I couldn't believe it.

75
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,775
I finally found an intelligent,
sophisticated woman...

76
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:39,870
...who hadn't heard any of my
knock-knock jokes.

77
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,948
'Orange who?'

78
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:45,318
All right, Moe.
Give it a punch line, nice and easy.

79
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,478
Orange you glad I didn't say banana?

80
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,626
The gargoyle has landed!

81
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,328
'You're funny.'

82
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:58,591
Very nice. Now how can I put this?

83
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:04,648
'Are you sure you're not actually
some creepy guy in a public library?'

84
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,335
'No. How about you?'

85
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:13,112
'Actually, there is a much creepier guy
right next to me.'

86
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,814
You know I'm a woman!

87
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:18,885
We used to own a cat together!
She had babies! Here's yours!

88
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,322
MOE: I would do anything
to chat with Maya,

89
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,757
short of actually purchasing a computer.

90
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:28,728
We decided to take the next big step,
exchanging photos.

91
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:33,099
Okay, this is it.
I finally get to see what she looks like.

92
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,401
Darest I click on this jpeg?

93
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,501
No! I daresen't!

94
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,372
Yes, I darest!

95
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,701
So, what did she look like?

96
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,847
ALL: Whoa!

97
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,315
Yeah, she was a knockout.

98
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:55,450
Which meant I was screwed because
now I had to send her a picture of me.

99
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:59,259
All right, before I send this,
I'd better un-beady the eyes,

100
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,363
de-Neanderthal the brow,
smooth out my hate lines,

101
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:09,002
lighten up the ear hair, switch my lips,
then black tie the whole deal.

102
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:14,032
I can't build a relationship on a lie.
The lies come later.

103
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:23,416
She thinks I'm cute!
O frajulous day! Callooh! Callay!

104
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,288
So, that's why I'm cleaning things
and flushing things,

105
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,490
and making this place look respectable.

106
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,994
She's coming to meet me here, tonight.

107
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:39,056
Moe's rat-free tavern.

108
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,900
Heya, Marge. Yeah, yeah, Homer's here.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,703
You want Homer?
I'm sorry, I thought you meant Himmler.

110
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:44,904
Heinrich Himmler.

111
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,006
You know, the guy who invented
the Heimlich manure.

112
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,408
Those are two different people!

113
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,410
Well, they're both here.
And neither one is your husband.

114
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,060
This press conference is over.

115
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,558
Oh, Maggie made some new friends.

116
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:10,196
Aw... Burrowing your head into your daddy.

117
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:13,866
A sign that my baby
is happy and confident.

118
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,317
Ah! Yeah! Okay, she said she'd be here
at exactly 8:00.

119
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,524
You calling my girl a liar?

120
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,295
Okay.

121
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,635
I've been stood up.

122
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,735
Moe, I'm down here.

123
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,775
Oh! You're a little person. I'm...
No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

124
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,745
What's the correct term?
- Little person.

125
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,541
Look at me being polite!

126
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,183
So, aren't you gonna invite me in?

127
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,283
Of course.

128
00:08:05,383 --> 00:08:07,820
I just have to... I have
to tidy up the place.

129
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,920
Just one sec.

130
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,192
Oh!

131
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,261
Yeah, that's better.

132
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:23,469
So, Maya, have you always been this size?
Or is this like a Benjamin Button deal?

133
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:29,509
No. I mean, it's just your picture
made you look more life-sized.

134
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,277
That was taken at LegoLand.

135
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,780
I was afraid you'd be
disappointed in the real me.

136
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,114
What? Are you kidding me?

137
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,884
You're the best thing to
come into this bar since cable TV.

138
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,252
And unlike cable TV,

139
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,722
I ain't stealing you from the Chinese
restaurant across the street there.

140
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:46,417
I see you watch ESPN2! I know!

141
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,028
Yeah, that's great there, Ling Chow.

142
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:52,198
So, you still want to go out?
- That's why I'm here.

143
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,500
Great. Let me get a car seat.
- Car seat?

144
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,803
Yeah. I took out the passenger seat
to save gas.

145
00:08:56,903 --> 00:09:01,663
But I'm gonna use it now
because we're gonna do the town!

146
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,711
So, instead of getting a new bar sign,

147
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,815
I saved 300 bucks
by changing my name to Moe.

148
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,684
Moe! You eat alone again tonight, huh?

149
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,419
Table for one, facing the wall!

150
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,291
Whoa, whoa. Not so fast, garlic press.
I'm here with my date.

151
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,827
She's beautiful. But so far away.

152
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:29,160
Mmm. You're a good kisser.

153
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:33,473
Yeah. I practice by siphoning gas
out of other people's tanks.

154
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,443
But I never tasted super premium
that was half as good as you.

155
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,312
Oh, Moe.

156
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,412
Yeah.

157
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,721
How'd your date go, Moe?

158
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,267
Incredible. I've never
felt like this before.

159
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:53,259
It's like my heart wants to do her.

160
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,627
ALL: Aw...

161
00:09:54,727 --> 00:10:00,677
So, when are we gonna meet her?
- I can't wait until you guys get to...

162
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,695
Yep. That's what we'd do.

163
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,574
Let me ask you guys something.

164
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,693
How would you treat a person...

165
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:13,613
...who's generally dynamite
but in some way...

166
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:14,780
...a little different?

167
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,384
You mean like how we treat Homer?
- Because he can't remember limericks?

168
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:19,485
I can, too.

169
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:24,524
There once was this guy from an island
off the coast of Massachusetts...

170
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,425
Nantucket, I think it was.

171
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:29,896
Anyway, he had the most unusual
personal characteristic,

172
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,396
which was... Uh... Um...

173
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,267
He can't win.

174
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,739
Look at him struggling
with the simplest rhyme.

175
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,330
It's A-A-B-B-A, dumb ass.

176
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,702
HOMER: There you are.

177
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:15,775
Aw... Innocent babies
whistling nonchalantly. How sweet.

178
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,700
Maggie will be back
to play with you tomorrow.

179
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,949
Come on, Maggie.
Have some grapefruit.

180
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,216
She seems upset.

181
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:29,331
Maybe if I lay down a beat on my bongos,
that'll soothe her.

182
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,295
Dad, do you have any idea
what's gotten into Maggie?

183
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,363
How would I know?

184
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,565
You've been spending
so much time with her.

185
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,895
I have not. Oh, right. You think I do.

186
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,102
Hmm.

187
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,174
ANNOUNCER: When you leave your children,

188
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,843
do you really know whom
you're leaving them with?

189
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:56,383
Your little angels are safe with me.
Enjoy your second honeymoon.

190
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,250
You wash me unmentionables!

191
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:05,619
And you, preheat the oven
for two children at 450!

192
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:12,632
ANNOUNCER: When you can't be there,
Prying-Eye Surveillance can!

193
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,433
We take images from your camera,

194
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,502
scramble them,
beam them to our orbiting satellite,

195
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,537
unscramble them,
then scramble them again,

196
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:21,307
then unscramble them
that all-important final time.

197
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,276
Our competitors claim
we scramble our images too much.

198
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:28,031
We say, can you love
your children too much?

199
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,020
The only thing better than Prying-Eye
watching your children...

200
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,988
...is you watching your children.

201
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,148
And we know that's not gonna happen.

202
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,525
Hmm...

203
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,564
Wait a second, Marge.

204
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:49,802
Do you really want to use your baby
as a tool to spy on your husband?

205
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,104
Yes, you do.
- I wasn't talking to you.

206
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,859
When you say it,
it's not just in your head.

207
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,101
This is where I live.

208
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,417
So is there a knob,
or an 'open sesame' type deal or what?

209
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,517
My house is over there.

210
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:10,256
You didn't actually think
I lived in a tree, did you?

211
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,959
No. Hey, no...
Hey, a lot of people live in trees.

212
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:17,229
Tarzan, the Berenstain Bears,
flood victims.

213
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,933
Umpa-lumpa, we are so small

214
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,645
Why should I be watching anything...

215
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,047
...when I could look at the most
beautiful thing in the world?

216
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,240
You'se.
- Me's?

217
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:40,486
That's right.
Kiss the troll and win a prize.

218
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,954
Yeah.

219
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,860
Listen, there is one thing
that keeps bothering me.

220
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,928
Is it my religion?

221
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,831
Because I am a snake handler,
but not an observant one.

222
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:56,035
If we have kids, they just have to have
a ceremony with a cobra by age three...

223
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,870
...so their grandfather will be happy.

224
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,171
No, that's fine.

225
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,073
It's just that I can't help wondering...

226
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,709
...why you've never introduced me
to anyone you know.

227
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,113
When your mailman waved to us,
you made me hide under that traffic cone.

228
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,448
Well, I do know this one couple,

229
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:14,520
the Simpsons, I believe their name is,
that ain't too judgmental.

230
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,056
She's a stand-up dame
and he's a fall-down drunk.

231
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,860
And, well, we'll make a double date of it.
Now let's get back to what we were...

232
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,829
Hey, what's going on?
Whoa! You turned into a doll!

233
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,831
I just do that to freak people out.

234
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,233
Oh!

235
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,675
Here she is, Homer,

236
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,411
the wonderful girl
I've been telling you about.

237
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,511
Pleased to meet you.

238
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:46,352
Perhaps this is inappropriate,
but I have a mechanical question,

239
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:50,156
while the kids are out of the room,
that I can't help wondering about.

240
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,559
In a nuclear power plant,

241
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:57,763
just how is nuclear energy
turned into electricity?

242
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,999
Well, if I remember
my high school physics,

243
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:04,336
the controlled nuclear reaction
creates steam, which powers a turbine.

244
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:07,106
Man, oh, man, slap a ring on that.

245
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:19,819
All right, Homer.
Let's see what my baby's been up to.

246
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:23,422
Here we are, Maggie, that park you love.

247
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,523
Mmm.

248
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,826
Marge, Moe and Maya are here
for our double date.

249
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,926
Oh. Okay. I'm coming.

250
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,750
See you when the moon comes out.

251
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,444
That made me thirsty.

252
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,747
For you.

253
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:55,481
She's beautiful, Moe.
- Yeah, she sure is.

254
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,556
Hmm.

255
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,962
Here comes ours, honey.

256
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:13,539
Would you look at me?
I'm the happiest bartender in the world.

257
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,639
Sorry, fellas!

258
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,678
Maya, there's something I want to ask you.

259
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,314
I don't know why I'm so nervous.

260
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,950
This makes more sense
than anything I've ever done.

261
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,886
Well, other than keeping
all my Netflix movies...

262
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,854
...and saying the post office lost them.

263
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,954
Anyway...

264
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,957
Will you marry me?

265
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,643
Are you asking me
to be your little woman?

266
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:40,065
Well, as long as you don't mind
having a small wedding.

267
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,370
We can drink champagne
out of an acorn top!

268
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,641
Our first dance
will be on the head of a pin, there.

269
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,944
I've been hogging all the good ones.

270
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,381
All right, now you go.
But, hey, keep it short.

271
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,552
What's the matter, doll?
We were just having fun.

272
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:04,223
I stopped having fun about 10 jokes ago
and you just kept going.

273
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,725
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Forgive me, kitten...

274
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:10,396
I mean, cat... I mean, tiger...
I mean, saber-toothed tiger. I mean...

275
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:14,800
I think you should go now.
- Okay. I screwed this up pretty bad.

276
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,504
And I'm sorry.
How long do you people remember things?

277
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,604
Get out.

278
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:27,246
Guys, after all the years
I've given you advice,

279
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,048
now I need a little advice from you.

280
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,683
We never follow your advice.

281
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,218
The one time I did,
I went to jail for three years.

282
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,887
You made some good friends,
didn't you?

283
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,423
Just because you're chained to a guy
don't make him your friend.

284
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,992
To-may-to, to-mah-to.
Now, how am I gonna win Maya back?

285
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,428
Well, if I've learned anything
from romantic comedies,

286
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,364
is that you gotta make
a grand reckless gesture.

287
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,866
The kind that looks like
it might blow up in your face.

288
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,002
But what if it blows up in my face?

289
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,037
With your face, who cares?

290
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,872
You gotta make me shorter, Doc.

291
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:56,809
What do you mean?

292
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:01,613
I mean, take out bones, guts, whatever
you gotta do to make me a micro-Moe.

293
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,083
What you're asking
is completely unethical.

294
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:08,053
No licensed physician
would perform that operation.

295
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,455
Now close your eyes.

296
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,558
And when you wake up,
you will be a woman.

297
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,828
No, no, no, no, no!
I want to be shorter for a woman.

298
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,929
Uh-oh!

299
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,031
I mixed you up with the last guy.

300
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:23,004
I look nothing like Julie Newmar!

301
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,772
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

302
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,809
Maya is gonna love the new me.
- Moe, why did you do this?

303
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,414
Well, I ain't done nothing yet,
but I'm considering it.

304
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,150
Because I want to share
your world forever.

305
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:43,856
Moe, if you have to be like me to love me,
then you're not seeing the real me.

306
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,826
I see you, Maya.
I see you every time I look at the moon.

307
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,295
I see you in puddles after it rains.

308
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:54,666
I see you in the glazed eye of a barfly
who's had one too many.

309
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,238
So cut me down to size, Doc.

310
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,940
And could you wrap up the bones
so my dog can have fun with them?

311
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,144
But, Moe, I don't want someone
who sees me as short.

312
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:08,847
I want someone who just
sees me as beautiful.

313
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,049
Goodbye.

314
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:16,524
Okay, no more delays.
I've got to watch this.

315
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,367
I'll save you, Maggie!

316
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,340
I'm telling!

317
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,645
Now what?

318
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,286
Sweetie, you saved me.

319
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,555
Well, I promise that
wherever you go in this world,

320
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,523
I will always be there for you.

321
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:54,393
Maggie, I love you
from the tip of your toes...

322
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,629
...to the bow on your hair
with the red blinking light.

323
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,432
God bless your mother
for making you with me.

324
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:05,170
What you watching, honey?

325
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:11,220
Homer Simpson, you are a strong finisher.
- And I'm good at beginnings.

326
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,820
What's the matter, Homer?
- Not a thing in the world.

327
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,956
Yeah, I wish I could say the same.

328
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,592
Moe, this is a great thing for you.

329
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,595
You went from sitting on the sidelines
to getting in the game.

330
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:34,533
Sometime when you least expect it,
you realize that someone loved you.

331
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,002
And that means
someone can love you again.

332
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,102
That'll make you smile.

333
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,381
Hey, Homer was right.

334
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:58,458
Who'd have thought such a little woman
could make me feel so big?

335
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,115
