Oh. So I can decide
that all my thoughts from yesterday

140
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,080
are stored in, I don't know, the oven?

141
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,373

[Marge] Whoa!

147
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,429
{\an8}I'm here. I'm here. Bart, what happened?

148
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,472
{\an8}- Splinter.
- Oh.

149
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,433
{\an8}- That's it?
- Well, it's kind of bleeding.

150
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,184
Maybe not.

151
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,145
[gasps] When did your hands get so big?

152
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,813
They're bigger than mine.

153
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,274
I don't know.
Maybe I got freaky-big hands.

154
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,526
Tweeze, please.

155
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:07,199
I guess it's been
a while since we held hands.

156
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,284
- Ew. Did you get it?
- Mmm.

157
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,369
Thanks.

158
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,163
So that's why you're having nightmares.

159
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,124
Bart is super rude and full of splinters.

160
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,250
Maybe.

161
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:20,337
Or maybe I'm just sick
off hubcap hot dogs.

162
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,798
Why would awake-me eat those?

163

That doesn't seem like awake-me.

After enough booze slushies,
you think you can do anything.

165
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,639
I challenged the valet to an arm wrestle

166
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,725
but he turned out to be just a sign.

167
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:39,523
Why was I drinking frozen wine in a casual
dining chain restaurant on a school night?

168
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,817
I don't know.
After our meeting with Bart's teacher,

169
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,318
you said you needed a drink.

170
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,445
[Marge] Hmm.

171
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,697
{\an8}Hmm.

172
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,324
Mmm. Whoa!

173
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,451
- [children laughing, echoing]
- Look, whatever Bart did,

174
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:55,455
we'll pay to have it cleaned or replaced
or for its therapy or...

175
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,332
Bart hasn't done anything.

176
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,793
I'm meeting with all the parents,
even the normal kids. [shouts]

177
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,336
Bart is normal.

178
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,797
I-I mean, we don't say normal anymore.

179
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,882
I mean, I-I'm talking to all the parents.

180
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:06,967
You're not special.

181
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,427
I-I mean, you are. [chuckles] But...

182
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,011
What did you wanna talk about?

183
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,431
As you know, Bounce-A-Thon means

184
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,641
we're getting close
to the end of the year,

185
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:18,562
so it's a good time to talk
about the transition to fifth grade.

186
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:22,357
You know, last year of elementary school,
and then it's on to middle school, then...

187
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,525
Middle school?

188
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,860
[rumbling]

189
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,070
Then everything changes.

190
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,740
- Girls, acne, drugs, body odor.
- [Marge] Hmm?

191
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,951
- [Marge groans]
- Listen, I've taught fifth grade.

192
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,078
Please buy your fifth grader deodorant.

193
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,249
Like, real deodorant,
not the "natural" stuff.

194
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,547
They may look like children,
but they smell like nervous cab drivers.

195
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,799
The point is, don't freak out.

196
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,218
Okay, about what?

197
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,803
Well, some parents start thinking,

198
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,265
"Oh, no, this is the end
of my kid's childhood." [chuckles]

199
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,685
But fifth grade isn't
the end of Bart's childhood. Right?

200
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,938
I mean, technically,
it is the last year of it. [chuckles]

201
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,399
[gasping]

202
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,527
Did you find out what happened to Bart?

203
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,779
It's what's going to happen.

204
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,698
He's going to grow up.

205
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,783
[Homer groans]

206
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,161
Damn kid.

207
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,540
- It was such a strange dream.
- [pen scratching]

208
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,960
Bart was four and he was so adorable.

209
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,795
I'd almost forgotten there was a time

210
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:29,633
when Bart was the sweet one
and Lisa was the difficult one.

211
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,677
Uh, to be fair, I'm only 18 months old,

212
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:38,308
so to be going through my terrible twos
now is actually pretty advanced. [grunts]

213
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,101
Crap, I'm still dreaming.

214
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,187
[gasps]

215
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,855
Bounce-A-Thon!

216
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,233
I'm coming too.

217
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,567
- [Lisa] Yay!
- [Bart] Aren't you sick?

218
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,818
I thought I heard you barfing.

219
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,154
{\an8}No, that wasn't barfing.

220
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:54,032
{\an8}That was loud, sloshy burps...

221
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,076
{\an8}- [gags, gulps]
- [both groan]

222
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:59,621
I signed up for snacks,
so I have to make marshmallow treat...

223
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,665
[gags] I can do this.

224
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,833
Just have to melt some margar... [gags]

225
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:08,004
Don't worry. Super-Dad is already making
the marshmallow treats.

226
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,048
Which Krispies did you use?

227
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,424
Rice or Cocoa?

228
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,509
I'm making my own.

229
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,179
The rice is "krispying" as we speak.

230
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,682
- Whoa.
- [gags] Oh, it smells like you burnt it.

231
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:22,227
No problem. I'll moisten it
with the last of the eggnog.

232
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,438
[Marge groans, gags]

233
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,733
I'm throwing up stuff I ate years ago.

234
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,152
I think I saw wedding cake.

235
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,321
You really should stay home.

236
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,740
[sighs] Maybe you're right. [groans]

237
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,952
This will be the first Bounce-A-Thon
I've ever missed.

238
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,870
Oh, missing stuff is the greatest.

239
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,455
When I do stuff,

240
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,708
I have a fear
of missing out on missing out.

241
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,710
You know, FO-MOO-MO.

242
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,254
Homer, listen, you have to do this for me.

243
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:53,883
Take a picture of each kid
giving a thumbs-up at the finish line.

244
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,635
{\an8}It's for my scrapbook.

245
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,555
I've already made
windows for each school year.

246
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,309
[groans] Bart, thumbs-up
slowly past Daddy.

247
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,811
Give him time to focus.

248
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:09,858
Mom, there's no easy way to tell you this,
so I'm just gonna say it.

249
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,736
At school, I'm becoming
known for taking cutting-edge,

250
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,738
no-holds-barred comedy photos.

251
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,822
It's true.

252
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,408
I've heard fifth graders say so.

253
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,827
So, w-what are... what are you saying?

254
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,830
There's no way I can do
a thumbs-up at Bounce-A-Thon.

255
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,914
What?

256
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,917
It will ruin the brand
I've been building since picture day.

257
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:32,130
My fans expect me to top
inside-out eyelids and Scotch Tape nose.

258
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,174
You don't understand
the pressure I'm under.

259
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:39,262
{\an8}But this is for the Bounce-A-Thon album.
So you'll always remember Bounce-A-Thon.

260
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,349
But... [sighs] ...I don't
even like Bounce-A-Thon.

261
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,268
I'm making fun of Bounce-A-Thon.

262
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,686
{\an8}What?

263
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:51,107
None of us kids like Bounce-A-Thon.
It's not very cool.

264
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,194
Well, you thought it was cool last year.

265
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,615
Bart, just one thumbs-up, please.

266
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:03,912
[sighs] I'm sorry, but no.
Crazy pictures is my thing now.

267
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,374
You should respect
that this is just how I am this year.

268
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,670
Bart, you sound so mature and grown-up.

269
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,963
[sobbing] I hate that.

270
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,299
[sobs]

271
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,386
[snores]

272
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,887
[crickets chirping]

273
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,430
- [creature growls]
- [Marge gasps]

274
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,140
[Homer's voice] Run! Something's coming!

275
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,642
- [Marge gasps]
- [creature growls]

276
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,894
[Marge panting]

277
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,438
- This is silly. I don't need symbolism.
- [growling]

278
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,691
I know what I'm afraid of
and it's not a bear.

279
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,983
- [bear grunts]
- Sorry.

280
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,319
[bear grunts, mutters]

281
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,155
[sighs] It's not a nightmare.

282
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,950
It's reality. Bart's growing up.

283
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,662
I should have treasured
every time he held my hand,

284
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,832
because I don't remember when he stopped.

285
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,961
The poet Khalil LeBron once said,

286
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:57,382
"Parents are bows...
like bow-and-arrow bows"...

287
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,466
[Marge] Hmm.

288
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:02,304
..."from which children are shot forth
as an arrow thingy."

289
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,934
The bow doesn't feel sad when it sees
how far and true the arrow flies.

290
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,979
Well, the bow feels a little sad.

291
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,022
The bow doesn't wanna lose touch,

292
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:16,360
and the arrow has never been great
about answering texts.

293
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,614
But even after Bart grows up,
you'll still have Lisa and Maggie.

294
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:27,412
Oh, my God. Lisa and Maggie. It's going
to happen with all of them. [groans]

295
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,496
- Oops.
- [Marge groans]

296
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,206
[rumbling]

297
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,042
Bart is just the beginning.

298
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,756
[echoing] One by one...

299
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,177
all my babies will leave the nest.

300
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,140
[echoing] I'm gonna lose all of them.

301
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:58,651
Honey, we mustn't break awake-you's brain.

302
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:02,655
Remember those commercials where they
show you what depression is like?

303
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:07,035
A rain cloud follows you everywhere.
You get sucked into sofas.

304
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:10,831
And when it gets really bad,
your windup monkey stops clapping.

305
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,499
[gasps]

306
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,709
Look. Look, Bart's at a playground.

307
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,379
Bart. Bart, they have your favorite
back-and-forth riding thingy.

308
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,883
[muffled] The duck, Bart. Ride the duck!

309
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,676
[muffled] Bart!

310
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:27,681
No!

311
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,141
[children chattering]

312
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,187
Okay. Maybe I am
being a teensy bit negative.

313
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,527
[Homer's voice] Okay.
A little brain hurricane.

314
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:44,781
My time as a mom
will eventually come to an end.

315
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:48,535
I'll have to fill my days
with a bunch of stupid hobbies.

316
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,538
I don't want an Etsy storefront!

317
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:56,084
It's not happening now
so it's silly to be sad about it now.

318
00:13:56,085 --> 00:14:00,672
It's like going to work on time.
There's no point.

319
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,967
I wanna show you something. [grunting]

320
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,637
[grunting]

321
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,806
[Marge] Whoa!

322
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,933
I'm coming too.

323
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,309
- [Lisa] Yay!
- [Bart] Aren't you sick?

324
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,561
I thought I heard you barfing.

325
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,187
- Freeze it right there.
- [tape clicks]

326
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:21,109
Now, watch it again.
But this time, look over here.

327
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,695
[tape rewinds]

328
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,029
I'm coming too.

329
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,114
Yay!

330
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:31,953
[singsongy] Mommy's coming. Yes, she is.
Do-do-do-do-do. My mom. Uh-huh!

331
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,747
She's rehearsing her thumbs-up.

332
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:35,999
Oh.

333
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,294
Oh, I was so sad that Bart
had outgrown the Bounce-A-Thon

334
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,839
I couldn't see
that my sweet Lisa still loves it.

335
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,301
For now.
Next year she'll probably turn on it too.

336
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,137
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you
to get out of the dark place, please.

337
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:53,892
[grunts] You're right.
Bounce-A-Thon still means a lot to Lisa.

338
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,186
So, what are you?
Like, my feelings police?

339
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,271
[chuckling] No,

340
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,608
I'm pretty sure I'm here 'cause,
deep down, you're attracted to me.

341
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:06,738
The uniform, the low center of gravity,
my thick syrupy voice. Heh.

342
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,489
I don't think so.

343
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,074
If anything, I'm into Eddie.

344
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,577
Yeah, he's a beautiful man.

345
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,956
I love that Lisa was so happy
I was gonna be there.

346
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,167
I should be there for her.

347
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:23,713
I've got to get to the Bounce-A-Thon
before Lisa's childhood slips away.

348
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,341
How could I wake myself up?

349
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,301
Oh, well, this will do it.

350
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,639
[gasps, grunts]

351
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,351
Okay. Looking good. Feeling good.

352
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:36,893

[retches]

354
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,481
Even better now.

355
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,901
[pants] I'll be there, Lisa.
I won't miss it.

[retches]

361
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:02,585
Okay, I ruined the car.
But Mommy's s-still coming, Lisa.

362
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,671
[gasps]

363
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,422
Okay, here we go.

364
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,468
Oh, I gotta sign up. Okay. Username?

365
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,720
Uh, uh. Bounce-Mom.

366
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,263
Taken. Fine.

367
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,391
Uh, Barf-Mom.

368
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,059
Taken, really?

369
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,103
Borf-Mom.

370
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,188
What? Oh, come on.

371
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:25,693
Marge. Oh, that worked.

372
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,491

[shouts, pants]

376
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,792
I'm here, Lisa.

377
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,751
[upbeat music playing on speakers]

378
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:49,382
I promised to wear this humorous wig for
Bounce-A-Thon if we had 30 lice-free days

379
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:54,012
and, uh, well, we had 29 but I'm just
gonna assume that today is gonna go well.

380
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:58,057
"And on the bounce track right now,
the second grade."

381
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,726
[gasps] That's Lisa's class.

[Principal Skinner grunts]

384
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,981
[Marge] Excuse me.
Excuse me, let me through.

385
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,191
I'm here to support my child.

386
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:12,405
Yeah. Well, guess what, Princess Blue?
We're all here to support our kids.

387
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,116
So stick that in your G-string
and make change.

388
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,202
I'm sorry.
I'm very, very sick, and I just...

389
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,538
Sick? W-W-What kind of sick?

390
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:25,710
I don't know. Some kind of, um,
I don't know, pox or plague.

391
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,420
- [parents muttering]
- [Kirk] Oh, boy.

392
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,505
[Marge chuckles]

393
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:35,888
[sniffs, groans] Oh, no. Food smells.
It's okay. I'll just hold my breath.

394
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,474
- [person 1] Mmm.
- [person 2] Churro.

395
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,560
- [person 3] Seafood.
- [person 4] What are you gonna get?

396
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,145
[person 5] Or should I have sushi?

397
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,564
Must get picture.

398
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,775
[gagging]

399
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,156
[Ms. Peyton, echoing] Mrs. Simpson?

400
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,240
[Marge, echoing] Huh?

401
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,409
Did... Did I get the picture?

402
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,494
[grunts]

403
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,829
[groaning] No. Huh?

404
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,499
I took a photo after I passed out?

405
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,169
Yeah. We had to pry the phone
from your hand.

406
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,089
I've been kind of a wreck
since our meeting.

407
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,258
You know,
when you said Bart's childhood is over.

408
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:18,012
[gasps] I did not say that.
I would never say that.

409
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,681
Bart's childhood isn't over.

410
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:25,770
I did notice that you got very quiet
after I mentioned middle school.

411
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,647
You didn't say anything else.

412
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,858
Except to ask about happy hour
at Tuesday O'Fridayhans.

413
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:36,197
Wait, you didn't say he was
heading toward girls and drugs and acne?

414
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,866
No, of course not.

415
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,868
Oh, my gosh. That was a dream.

416
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:44,247
I should have noticed
that you were 17' tall.

417
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,126
I ate bad things last night.

418
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,628
And you didn't say we needed
to buy Bart deodorant next year.

419
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,048
Oh, no, no, no. I did say that.
That part is very important.

420
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,759
Strong deodorant.

421
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,346
Hey. Bart's got a lot of childhood left.

422
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:05,309
I mean, he scores in the 50th percentile
for knowing his right and left which is...

423
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:10,231
oh, not a test score I should have said
out loud at a school function. [sighs]

424
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,858
Are you going to be okay?

425
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:17,864
Yes. I'm just gonna lie here
until the school stops spinning.

426
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,782
[snores]

427
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,075
[breathes deeply]

428
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,368
Feeling better?

429
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,744
[Marge] Mm-hmm.

430
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:28,541
I missed the picture,
but Lisa was so happy to see me today.

431
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,710
So for now, I'm happy.

432
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,712
And who knows what the future holds?

433
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,755
Bart could knock up
his high school girlfriend.

434
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,967
You could have grandchildren
before Maggie starts kindergarten.

435
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,679
Wouldn't that be nice? Mmm.

436
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,518
[sighs] Time to wake up. [grunts]

437
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,521
[gasps, sighs]

438
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,858
Here he comes.

439
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,862
Mmm. My funny little guy.

440
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,618
[crowd gasps]

441
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,995
- [laughing] Th... Th...
- [Homer] Huh?

442
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:09,999
- Th-That's really good. [laughs]
- [Homer, Lisa chuckle]

443
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,336
[pants] Did you get the picture?
Was my crack centered?

444
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,088
Oh, Bart. It was perfect.

445
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,673
You liked it?

446
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,675
I loved it!

447
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,968
Thanks.

448
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:24,096
Wanna go to the dunk tank?
The gym teacher I hate is on the chair.

449
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,181
Sure.

450
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,600
Oh.

451
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,602
[Bart chuckles]

452
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,813
[sniffles] Let's dunk that sucker.

453
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:38,987
[sniffs] And on the way home,
let's go deodorant shopping.
