1
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,123
I haven't seen you before.

2
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,427
Yeah, we go around...
jumping, jump, jump.

3
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,696
Oh, we bouncy ba...

4
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,933
Release the hounds.

5
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:48,248
I'm so excited Springfield
finally has a vegan restaurant.

6
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,551
I thought
you'd enjoy this, Lisa.

7
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:54,054
You deserve to have the food
that only you like.

8
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:56,023
Your St. Louis-style
Baby Back Fibs,

9
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,892
leg of yam and Wagyu beets.

10
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,228
Dad, are you sure
you're okay eating here?

11
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,463
I can eat anything

12
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,967
as long as I pretend
it once had a face.

13
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:08,969
And eyes.

14
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:10,971
Why are you both
kissing up to Lisa?

15
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:13,607
Is this her last meal?

16
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,943
You're gonna want to look thin
in your coffin,

17
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,911
so I'll eat your dessert.

18
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:20,080
Sure, have my dessert.
You'll look like Dad.

19
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:24,885
And for your information,
we are not kissing up.

20
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:27,154
By the way, Lisa,
have you picked a subject yet

21
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,157
for your Most Interesting
Person I Know paper?

22
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:31,892
Aha! Mystery solved.

23
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,661
Once again, the school pits
parents against each other.

24
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:37,064
Homer, you're up.
Sell yourself, dude.

25
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,067
Lisa, hi. Homer Simpson,
longtime fan.

26
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,469
Astronaut, sometime taxpayer.

27
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:43,904
Oh, well, let's see.

28
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,673
The most interesting person
I know is a white male.

29
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,910
That'll go over great
in today's climate.

30
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:51,979
I hope you like blowback.

31
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,715
Mom, Dad, I've made my decision.

32
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,785
After a lot of soul-searching,
I've decided to go with...

33
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,555
Frink! I'm writing
about Professor Frink.

34
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,123
Who?

35
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,326
You know.
Flavin, glayvin, hoyvik.

36
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:08,395
That Coke bottle with teeth?

37
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:12,199
He's devoted his life to helping
the world through science.

38
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:15,669
Say, can you tell me
if I came in second or third?

39
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,704
It's best not to proceed
down that road.

40
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:21,775
Fine. Then I can end
this little vegan charade.

41
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,718
Professor Frink,
I want to thank you so much

42
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,087
for letting me visit you
during office hours.

43
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,089
His last visitor
was the process server

44
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,058
for the monkey who's suing him.

45
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,359
Who's this?

46
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,128
Oh, well,
that's Professor Hessler.

47
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:42,396
We share the space here.

48
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:45,565
Pay her no mind.
She's in the humanities.

49
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,603
Professor Frink,
I'd love to know

50
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,039
how you got started in science.

51
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:57,044
Oh, science? Well, I was created
by science, my dear child.

52
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,578
That was you?

53
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:02,215
Oh, no, no, I was the world's
second test-tube baby.

54
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,419
Yes, I was greeted
with far less fanfare.

55
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,421
My parents had great chemistry.

56
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,123
No love,
but they were chemists.

57
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,060
The only way I could get
noticed was through science

58
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,429
and changing
the pitch of my voice

59
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,865
so they couldn't help
but notice me.

60
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,635
But I never had
my breakthrough.

61
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:25,038
In a world of Einsteins,
I am a James Chadwick.

62
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:27,074
- Who?
- Well, exactly.

63
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,910
It's too bad your name
isn't famous.

64
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,379
All this will change,
for I have been developing

65
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:35,248
my own cryptocurrency.

66
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,185
I have no idea
what that means.

67
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,454
What do they teach you
at that school?

68
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,155
How to get the teachers coffee.

69
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,992
Yeah... Anyway, I will explain
cryptocurrency by clicking

70
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:51,498
a link to TV's most beloved
scientist, Mr. Jim Parsons.

71
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,033
People think I'm a nerd,

72
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,102
but I'm actually super cool.

73
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,504
That's why I'm here to talk
about the really cool subject

74
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,140
of distributed consensus-based
cryptocurrency.

75
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,742
Kachinga.

76
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:10,250
Could a nerd do that?
I don't think so.

77
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,119
For cryptocurrency to work,
we need a record

78
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,954
of every transaction
that occurs.

79
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,990
These are recorded in what's
called a distributed ledger.

80
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,251
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

81
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,986
When you use the currency,

82
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,588
the transaction is recorded
in the ledger.

83
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:52,259
I can dig it.

84
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,994
And when one ledger book
gets filled up,

85
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,096
we add to a chain
of previous books.

86
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,265
That's the blockchain.

87
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,599
Later, glitches.

88
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,934
If you'd like to learn more

89
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,536
about how
cryptocurrencies work,

90
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,305
here's everything else
you need to know.

91
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:09,042
And goodbye from me,
super cool Jim Parsons.

92
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,712
It went in.
It went in! It went in!

93
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,016
It went in! It went in...
You saw it! It went in!

94
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,552
So will Frinkcoin
finally be the invention

95
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,086
that makes me rich?

96
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,555
Or will...

97
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,558
Well, thank you
for your support.

98
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:27,327
Frinkcoin, the brainchild
of longtime bachelor...

99
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:30,564
of science, Professor Frink,
is making a mint.

100
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,933
Arnie Pye is live
at the news conference.

101
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,034
I don't know why, Kent.

102
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,869
With all the layoffs,
they've got me,

103
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:38,038
the traffic guy,
on the science beat.

104
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,007
I just found out
how a helicopter flies.

105
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,542
It's terrifying!

106
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,411
Well, whatever
the heck that was,

107
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,546
Frinkcoin was just rated
the world's most stable

108
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,215
financial instrument,
beating gold,

109
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,917
the renminbi and roadside corn.

110
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,220
Well, can't eat
no cryptocurrency

111
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,955
when the grid goes down.

112
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,458
That's why I started
my hedge fund.

113
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,396
Another billionaire?
How did he make his money?

114
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,398
Paraffin? Castor oil?

115
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,068
Whale bone corsets
for the woman who dares?

116
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,237
Actually, cryptocurrency.

117
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:14,040
Oh, I know about cryptocurrency.
I have it in my crypt.

118
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,876
No, sir, this is a new kind
of digital currency,

119
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,377
based on blockchain.

120
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:20,647
Oh, I know all about blockchain.

121
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:26,086
Again, not what you're thinking.

122
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,154
This new currency
has made Professor Frink

123
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,090
the richest man in Springfield.

124
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:34,394
Wait. Are you saying I am no
longer the richest man in town?

125
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,696
I'm afraid not, Monty.

126
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,403
You have the gall
to call me Monty?

127
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,171
Just because you chew my food

128
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,674
makes you think
we're on a first-name basis?

129
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,809
Of course not, sir.
I'll never do that again.

130
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,078
I will have my dinner now.

131
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,114
Lobster Thermidor.

132
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,882
Start chewing.

133
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,118
But, sir,
I'm allergic to shellfish.

134
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:01,721
And I'm not, Wayland.

135
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,965
It went in... You saw it.
It went in!

136
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,635
Hi, Professor.

137
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:16,903
I wanted to see
how you're enjoying

138
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,105
your newfound fame and wealth.

139
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,075
He hasn't invested in deodorant.
I can tell you that much.

140
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:26,079
Well, the first ten million
went to pay off student loans.

141
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,114
Strange, strange.

142
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:31,518
I have the fame and fortune
I've always desired and yet,

143
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:35,221
I'm, well, I'm as empty
as a Dewar vacuum flask.

144
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,392
Well, maybe it's time
to take care of yourself now.

145
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,628
What are the things
that you've always wanted?

146
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:44,698
Oh, let's see, I've always
wanted one of those pens

147
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,700
with the four different colors.

148
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,501
I fashioned one myself,
but it's...

149
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,805
it's a tad bit unwieldy.

150
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,243
You can get those pens,
and so much more.

151
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,480
Do they make a silencer
for his constant nasal whistle?

152
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,116
Well, you know what?

153
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:06,553
You will never have to worry
about my adenoidal hiss again.

154
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,725
I can still hear it!

155
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,327
He's in Chicago, for God's sake!

156
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:17,063
Moe, Lisa has offered
to pay my bar tab.

157
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,366
You do accept Frinkcoin, right?

158
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,369
I'll accept any currency
except the Albanian lek.

159
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,170
I sunk everything I had into it,

160
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,973
and now I ain't got
two qindarkas to rub together.

161
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,976
But that Frink, man,
boy, he's sure got it made.

162
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:33,246
Yeah, I wonder
what he's doing now.

163
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:36,282
I said I wonder
what he's doing now!

164
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,686
Yes, come in.

165
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:41,955
So, are you happier?

166
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,691
No. No, I got everything
I wanted.

167
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,794
Even the pen.
But I'm still sad.

168
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,896
Aw, poor guy.

169
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,431
What?

170
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:54,401
That's just Amazon delivery.
Calm yourself.

171
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,737
You should have seen
poor Professor Frink, Dad.

172
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,040
Poor Frink?
He's the richest guy in town.

173
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,309
But he's not rich in the most
important thing there is.

174
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,678
Health?

175
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,448
Oh, yeah.

176
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,917
No. The most important thing
is friends.

177
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,887
Dad, you should take
Professor Frink to Moe's.

178
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,589
Oh, I can't do that. It's like
having your mother's sisters

179
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:17,891
come for a visit.

180
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,460
Actually, they're coming
in 20 minutes.

181
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,862
Taking Frink to Moe's.

182
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,899
Never seen a fat man
move so fast.

183
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,434
Got a cigarette?

184
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,502
Not since we moved to Disney.

185
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,906
All right, next question...
Hey! Pay attention.

186
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:36,976
Name a drink made
from hops and barley.

187
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,079
Barley hops?

188
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,447
No.

189
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,916
- Meryl Streep?
- Good guess, but no.

190
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,617
Hey, guys,

191
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,920
I was wondering if my friend
Professor Frink and I

192
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,788
could join you?

193
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,657
All right, but we've been
playing a long time.

194
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:54,127
Don't expect to just come in and
join a wall of trivia champs.

195
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,863
Well, oh, my goodness,
well, no one...

196
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,200
The Bay City Rollers,
Ed "Too Tall" Jones,

197
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,202
the cronut and ring-a-levio,

198
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,938
also known as ring-o-lario
on Staten Island,

199
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,440
but those people are, well,
they're quite backward.

200
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:09,943
All correct.

201
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,079
I'm "Too Tall" Jones, and even
I didn't know the answer was me.

202
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,352
- Sir?
- Oh, it's sir now, is it?

203
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:22,355
Not Monty or Queen B?

204
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,157
No, sir.

205
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,392
And I really appreciate
the long, healthy walk

206
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,061
from my new parking spot.

207
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,198
Get in all 10,000 steps.

208
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,033
Good, the two things
I can't take

209
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,736
are insubordination
and a slight breeze.

210
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,940
Yeah. Sir, to make you
the wealthiest man

211
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,442
in town again,
I've assembled a team

212
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,978
of the greatest mathematicians
and cryptographers

213
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,479
to ever leave their rooms.

214
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:49,082
They're here to develop...
Burnscoin.

215
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,717
Will there be actual coins?

216
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,218
If so, make sure they're made

217
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,087
from something men
must die mining.

218
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,056
Is there an ivory
that comes from people?

219
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,425
So, here are the programmers
working on your currency.

220
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,895
And I've discovered some serious
issues with this nuclear plant.

221
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,831
By my calculations,
the cracks in the coolant pipes

222
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,599
are growing exponentially.

223
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,036
Smithers, give this poindexter
a McKinley Rub.

224
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,275
Now, listen here,
you magna cum losers!

225
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,076
You are here for one reason
and one reason only.

226
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,647
To create a pseudo currency
like the Bitcoin or the peso

227
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,048
that will make me rich.

228
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,484
So rich I could buy
ten NFL teams.

229
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:25,952
Not the Jets.

230
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,287
Okay, people, laptops open,

231
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,289
headphones on, Red Bulls popped.

232
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,124
We'll get this, Monty.

233
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,061
I mean, I'm a sick man, sir.

234
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,963
I'll get help.

235
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,433
Wayland, I think what you're
doing comes out of anger.

236
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,001
Are you upset with Mr. Burns?

237
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,971
- No.
- Please, you're safe here.

238
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,974
Oh, the things I've done for
that hollow-boned horror show!

239
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,443
That interview he did
for Vanity Fair?

240
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,278
I wrote all his answers.

241
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,781
Like he would ever spend
a weekend in Santa Barbara.

242
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,983
I'm the one
who loves Sideways... me!

243
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,018
Does anyone have any thoughts
about how Wayland

244
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,253
can approach these feelings?

245
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,654
You? Oh, I'm sorry.

246
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,156
I don't know your name yet.

247
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,792
Well, I learned in dealing
with Bruce Willis that...

248
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,493
I'm sorry!

249
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,463
Whenever I say his name I expect
a phone to be thrown at me.

250
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,664
- Christian Bale.
- Roseanne.

251
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,899
- Jared Leto.
- Roseanne!

252
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,100
- Katherine Heigl.
- Trump.

253
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,501
- Trump. - Trump.
- Roseanne!

254
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,170
Wayland, I'm going
to write you a prescription

255
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,404
for Sychophantanyl.

256
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,806
Take one every time you feel

257
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,407
like saying
what you really think.

258
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,276
Ah, thank you.

259
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,778
I just got a text.

260
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,714
Anyone here who works
for Mariah Carey,

261
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,217
meet her at SoulCycle
and bring a kitten... now!

262
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,188
Listen, Professor,

263
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,056
why are we hanging
around Moe's Tavern

264
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,958
when we could be somewhere good?

265
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,860
Fear not, my new best friends.

266
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,528
I will take you on a tour

267
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,897
of Springfield's
finest establishments.

268
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,299
Come on, let's go.
It'll be joyous,

269
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,301
and raucous, and other things.

270
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,836
Three cheers for Frink!

271
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,971
Actually, studies show
that one and a half

272
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,407
is the optimum number
of cheers, so...

273
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:55,842
Hip hip hooray!

274
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,844
- Hip hip...
- And done.

275
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,746
<i>If you're poor
and find yourself</i>

276
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,849
<i>Outside the door,
just ask me</i>

277
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,984
<i>To buy your drink</i>

278
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,186
<i>Hangin' with the Frink</i>

279
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,157
<i>Clink my link,
you'll swim, not sink</i>

280
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,860
<i>Here is my pitch,
come on, be rich</i>

281
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,962
<i>Hey, what's to think</i>

282
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,998
<i>Hangin' with the Frink</i>

283
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:21,467
<i>Ah, yeah!</i>

284
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,870
This Frink has been gold
peacocking all over town.

285
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:27,006
What's taking you
Slide Rule Charlies so long?

286
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,875
We aren't able to create
a cryptocurrency

287
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,677
as powerful as the Frinkcoin.

288
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,079
But... this equation,
if solved,

289
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,782
could make all digital coins
worthless.

290
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,016
Including Frink's.

291
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,284
Excellent.

292
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:40,186
How long will it take to solve?

293
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,855
Well, if we work weekends
and bring in some extra help,

294
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,624
I'd say 90,000 years.

295
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,093
- Yeah...
- Yeah...

296
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:50,530
Get out!

297
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,934
As for Frink,
if I can't break his bank,

298
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,636
I'll break his spirit.

299
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,475
Amazing, Professor!

300
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,744
You win again!

301
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:08,247
This is my
only suit of clothes!

302
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,116
Ahoy-hoy!
I was in the neighborhood

303
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,918
and thought
we might have a drink.

304
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,087
You know, billionaire
to billionaire.

305
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:16,923
Oh, I just love champagne

306
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,858
that's been in space, don't you?

307
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:22,061
Now, listen to me, your friends
don't give a whit about you.

308
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:23,463
That is not true!

309
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,098
Those guys are my best buddies!

310
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:29,068
Fatso and Drunky
and the evil bartender there.

311
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,970
Well, think about this,
Professor.

312
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,572
The curse of wealth
is that you will never,

313
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:36,809
ever again know
if anyone truly likes you.

314
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,011
Oh, my, could it be
that they're,

315
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,247
well, they're really
just leeches?

316
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,823
Oh, evil and...

317
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,597
Frink interview, final chapter,
Happily Ever After.

318
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,932
I'm just so unbelievably sad.

319
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:00,933
I mean, is he right?

320
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,136
Do I really have
no true friends?

321
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,206
Come get some.

322
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,642
Don't worry about
what Mr. Burns says.

323
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,611
He's a vicious old viper
who knows

324
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,346
nothing of the human heart.

325
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,014
Oh, and you do?

326
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,783
Well, I've seen a lot
for an eight-year-old.

327
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,419
My parents have split up
nearly a thousand times.

328
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,455
My brother is a scab
on society's knee.

329
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,024
And every time I get a pony
or make a friend,

330
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,260
they get the hell out of town.

331
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,028
Wow, you have lived
quite a life.

332
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,197
Yeah, it's not all bad.

333
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,965
I had a jazz friend.

334
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,034
Who died.

335
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,937
Here's my plan, Smithers.

336
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,205
We put the equation here.

337
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,408
And the ingenuity of crowds will
solve it for us by tomorrow,

338
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:46,045
thus rendering all
cryptocurrency worthless.

339
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,213
Well, what if they don't?

340
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,848
Don't worry, Smithers.

341
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:52,051
If this doesn't work, I'll get
some of my old Yale buddies in.

342
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,387
Well, they're dead and their
children are dead, sir.

343
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,823
Oh, my.

344
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,526
Someone's gonna solve that?

345
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:03,963
This town is so dumb,
they built an indoor windfarm.

346
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,867
They're so dumb, they need
a recipe to make ice!

347
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,502
Stay in your lane, Mel!

348
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,504
You've given me no lane!

349
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,372
At least it's
not another billboard

350
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,209
complaining about crimes
I haven't solved.

351
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,323
Who would do this, Lou?

352
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,391
Who?!

353
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,497
All my life, I believed
in the scientific meth-od.

354
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,666
I need proof that
my friends actually are...

355
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,702
friends.

356
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:45,671
Hey, Professor.

357
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,240
Boy, I can't wait
to sit in the skybox

358
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,075
for the big game today.

359
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,243
I'm gonna have
chicken and popcorn

360
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,744
and never watch the game.

361
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,646
Well, I'm so sorry,
change in plans.

362
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,548
You see, the skybox
wasn't available,

363
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:58,084
so I got regular tickets.

364
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,719
Oh, that reminds me.

365
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,020
I need to have a cyst removed.

366
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,722
Now's as good a time as any.

367
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,023
Yeah, and I got to be there

368
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,858
to say,
do not resuscitate.

369
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,059
Do resuscitate!

370
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,962
Ah, I really should
write that down.

371
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:18,037
All right, now, now, the
experiment is not yet complete.

372
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,438
Let's just see here.

373
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,277
Oh, Professor, you kill me!

374
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:28,147
I never heard such a crazy
bunch of nonsense talk.

375
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,616
Yeah, I was speaking
Mandarin Chinese.

376
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:33,286
So... this time,
would one of you

377
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,288
be so kind as to...

378
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,925
No one outsmarts ol' Gil.

379
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,160
Ooh, hot, hot, hot!

380
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,461
Cha-cha!

381
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,499
Well, that's it, from now on,

382
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,168
my only company will be A.I.,
I insist.

383
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,404
My first independent thought is

384
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,373
I dislike you.

385
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,150
Oh, thank God you woke me.

386
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,619
I was having a terrible dream.

387
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:07,753
Oh, about what?

388
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,622
All the awful things I've done.

389
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:10,923
Oh, I knew you
shouldn't have had

390
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,558
that second blueberry at dinner,

391
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,126
but this is why I brought you.

392
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,995
Look, someone posted a solution
on the whiteboard.

393
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,763
Frink is ruined!

394
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:24,103
Yarr, this problem has been
speared in the head,

395
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,806
hauled on the deck,
and sliced up the guts,

396
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,175
mathematically speaking.

397
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,543
Yarr.

398
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,945
So, who found the solution?

399
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:35,881
Did I do it?

400
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,350
No...

401
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,851
I guess we'll never know.

402
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,286
The important thing
is that once again,

403
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,555
I am the richest man

404
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,191
in a town of 32,000 people.

405
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,693
Excellent.

406
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,204
And so, the equation was solved.

407
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,673
Solved by the one person
who could solve it.

408
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,109
Professor John Frink.

409
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,443
End of report.

410
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,978
How did you know?

411
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,848
A girl learns a lot writing
a second grade report.

412
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:12,051
I knew that you'd be willing to
throw away everything you had,

413
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:14,053
because it didn't mean anything.

414
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,688
And I had a pretty good idea

415
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,490
of what your handwriting
looks like.

416
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,192
Also, anyone else
smart enough to solve this

417
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:23,062
is too smart to come
to Springfield.

418
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,830
Well, you really understand me.

419
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:28,067
Young lady,
you are my best friend.

420
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,135
Hoyvik.

421
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,070
Aw, really?

422
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:35,007
Well, beware, I lose
everything I care about.

423
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:36,942
Well, you won't lose me.

424
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,078
I'll always be right here.

425
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:41,113
In this flash drive.

426
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,083
I will treasure this forever.

427
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,953
I had a billion dollars...
what have I done?!

428
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:54,694
Ten glorious days of peace.

429
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,462
I was able to finish
my dissertation.

430
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,065
Losing a billion dollars
means nothing

431
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,600
as long as I see you again.

432
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,339
Are we gonna do this?

433
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,289
<i>Thanks for the currency</i>

434
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,491
<i>All my dollar bills</i>

435
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,260
<i>Piled up to the hills</i>

436
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,529
<i>Ruble, pound, or Deutschmark</i>

437
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,766
<i>You all give me
such thrills</i>

438
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,136
Didn't I fight alongside you
in the war?

439
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:39,271
We weren't on the same side,

440
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,841
but I was there.

441
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,178
Ooh, much better.

442
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,314
<i>Thanks</i>

443
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,649
<i>For the currency</i>

444
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,752
<i>We watched it rise and fall</i>

445
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:55,054
<i>But we both had a ball</i>

446
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,656
<i>We made this song so long</i>

447
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,126
<i>It spilled into the crawl</i>

448
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,094
Hoyvik.
