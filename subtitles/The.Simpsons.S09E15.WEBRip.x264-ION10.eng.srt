The exports of Libya

73

One thing they export is corn.

74
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,819
Or as the Indians
call it, maize.

75
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,703
Another famous Indian
was Crazy Horse.

76
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,358
In conclusion, Libya
is a land of contrasts.

This is all Lisa's fault.

181
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,387
She started
the stupid U.N. Club!

182
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,299
Hey, Martin
seconded the motion.

183
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,177
It's entirely his fault.

184
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,894
People, people...

185
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,734
Let's not blame each other.

186
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,059
We all know
this is Milhouse's fault.

187
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,265
-(gasps)
-Yeah!

188
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:03,444
You and your stupid grapefruit
almost got us killed!

189
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,904
(all shouting)

190
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,778
(low trumpeting)

191
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,704
What's everyone's problem?

192
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,662
I'm glad we're stranded.

193
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,003
It'll be just like
the <i>Swiss Family Robinson,</i>

194
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,158
only with more cursing.

195
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,916
We're going to live like kings.

196
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,708
Damn hell ass kings!

197
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,591
(calypso playing)

198
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,926
Yahoo!

199
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,854
(monkey chattering)

200
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,904
...And every night,
the monkey butlers

201
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,191
will regale us
with jungle stories.

202
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,105
How many monkey butlers
will there be?

203
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,155
{\an8}One at first,
but he'll train others.

204
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,199
ALL: Cool! Yeah!

205
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,491
(conversations overlapping)

206
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,704
Good. Let's get to work.

207
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,794
Me and Nelson
will build the tree house.

208
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,959
Martin, draw up plans
for a coconut radio,

209
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,498
and, if possible,
a coconut Nintendo system.

210
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,712
What about the rest of us?

211
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,462
You guys gather food
for the big feast tonight

212
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,545
and maybe a little wine
for the older kids.

213
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,130
Delicious wine?

214
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,505
Exactly.

215
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,391
Oh, what am I gonna call
my Internet company?

216
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,889
All the good names are taken.

217
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,891
{\an8}Oh, wait-- I've got it.

218
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,853
{\an8}Flancrest Enterprises.

219
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,848
D'oh!

220
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,396
What exactly is it
your company does again?

221
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,190
This industry moves so fast,
it's really hard to tell.

222
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,565
That's why I need
a name that's cutting edge

223
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,822
like Cutco... Or Edgecom...

224
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,657
Interslice...

225
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,120
Come on, Marge, you're good
at these. Help me out.

226
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,081
How about...
CompuGlobal HyperMeganet?

227
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,752
Fine. It's not important.

228
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,211
What really matters
is my title.

229
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:48,002
I think I'll make myself
vice president.

230
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,007
No, wait.

231
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,168
Junior vice president.

232
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,717
(phone rings)

233
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,971
CompuGlobal HyperMeganet.

234
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,263
Junior vice president
Homer Simpson speaking.

235
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,137
How may I direct your call?

236
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,308
It's Patty.

237
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,980
(conch blowing)

238
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,823
Food patrol, we're all starved.

239
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:08,978
Let's see what you've got.

240
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,238
That's it?

241
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,410
What happened to all
the lobsters, mangoes,

242
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,868
and chewy, chewy cocoa beans?

243
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,198
All we found
were these oozing berries...

244
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,954
and they look pretty poisonous.

245
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,496
I eated the purpleberries.

246
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,671
(groaning)

247
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,167
How are they, Ralph?

248
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,627
Good?

249
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:36,005
They taste like... burning.

250
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,429
Okay, food patrol blew it.

251
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,473
Yeah?

252
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,556
Well, your tree house
looks kind of crummy, too.

253
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,153
Kind of really crummy.

254
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,688
BART: Well, when
monsoon season comes,

255
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,442
you'll be glad it's there.

256
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:51,938
Oh...

257
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:55,276
No food, no shelter,
no monkey butlers.

258
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,283
This island is a death hole.

259
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,485
We should've just swum
for it, like Otto.

260
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,825
(breathing heavily)

261
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,832
Well, I'm done for.

262
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,174
Whew.

263
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,458
At least I'll leave
a beautiful corpse.

264
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,461
Whoa!

265
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,677
Ho! Thank the good dude,
I'm saved.

266
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,604
And we can go back
for the kids, too.

267
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,603
Hmm.

268
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,814
{\an8}(speaking Chinese)

269
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,936
(in English) I think I'm going
to like it on this boat.

270
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,284
MILHOUSE: Run for your lives!

271
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,321
Monster!

272
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,164
Monster!

273
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,699
(all shrieking)

274
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,202
(panting)

275
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,870
There's no monster,
you big scaredy.

276
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,038
(with singsong voice)
Scaredy got scared.

277
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,547
Well, you'd be scared, too,
if you saw a monster.

278
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,959
-Nuh-uh.
-Uh-huh.

279
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,547
-Unlikely.
-Likely.

280
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:57,592
LISA: Knock it off!

281
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,335
We gotta find a way
to light a fire.

282
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,007
No problem. We can use
Scaredy's glasses.

283
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,519
Hey...

284
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,690
Wh-what's he doing?

285
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,398
Wh-what's that sound?

286
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,399
There you go.

287
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,020
Good as new.

288
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,067
What's good as new?

289
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,691
Who's talking?

290
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:22,156
I'm so hungry
I could eat at Arby's.

291
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,621
-Oh, my gosh!
-Oh, wow!

292
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,621
She really is hungry.

293
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,872
BOY: She's really hungry.

294
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:26,873
(low growling)

295
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,544
It's the monster!

296
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,791
(spritzing and inhaling)

297
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,665
No, it's not-- it's my tummy.

298
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,632
I mean stomach... Gut...

299
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:35,802
Crap factory.

300
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,630
Wait a minute.

301
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,795
We had a cooler full
of snacks on the bus.

302
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,175
Hey, yeah!

303
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,351
And I think
I know how I can get it.

304
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,272
Hey, I need that to live!

305
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,582
(gurgling scream)

306
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,667
(gurgling chuckle)

307
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,461
(gurgling groan)

308
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,804
Does anyone here like food?

309
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,760
(all cheering)

310
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,762
Stop!

311
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,096
We may have to live
on this food for a long time,

312
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,102
so no more until tomorrow.

313
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,271
But I'm hungry now.

314
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,693
Yeah, me, too!

315
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:37,111
Yeah! Who put
the duchess of dork in charge?

316
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,941
No one,
but if we're gonna survive,

317
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,686
we need rules and order.

318
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,778
Let's not forget what we
learned in the U.N. Club.

319
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:43,863
(humming Finnish folk tune)

320
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,868
Not now, Martin.

321
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,830
(seagulls chirping)

322
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,370
(smoke hissing)

323
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,918
Who wants rations?

324
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,958
ALL: Me, me!

325
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,342
I'm so hungry, I could puke.

326
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,549
(all gasp)

327
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,089
Where'd all the food go?

328
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,431
Morning. Is it time to eat?

329
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,724
Looks like you already did.

330
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,558
What are you talking about?

331
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,233
You ate our food!

332
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,271
Thanks a lot, Milhouse!

333
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,935
Now we're all gonna die
because of you!

334
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,694
But I swear I didn't do it.

335
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,356
-(belches)
-(sniffing)

336
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,032
Nacho cheese.

337
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,113
Get him!

338
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,373
You wouldn't dare hurt me.

339
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:36,674
You forget that I have...
The glasses!

340
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,960
Yoink!

341
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,093
(nervous chuckle)

342
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,419
Well, now that you've got
everything you need,

343
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,755
I'll just, you know,
get out of your hair.

344
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,012
Not so fast, two eyes.

345
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:50,064
Come on, let's slice him open
and get our food back.

346
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,179
Wait! We're not savages!

347
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,976
We live in a society of law.

348
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,399
Milhouse has the right
to a fair trial.

349
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,358
(moaning and groaning)

350
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,109
Society blows.

351
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,900
(keyboard keys clacking)

352
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,236
Ooh, Captain Janeway.

353
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,410
Mmm. Lace--
the final brassiere.

354
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,368
Oh, hurry up. I'm a busy man.

355
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,452
(slurping)

356
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,456
Ugh.

357
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,290
This high-speed modem
is intolerably slow.

358
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,246
-(beeping)
-Hey, what the...

359
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,207
Huh, the "Internet King."

360
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,877
I wonder if he can provide
faster nudity.

361
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,546
Welcome to the Internet,
my friend.

362
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,585
How can I help you?

363
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,967
I'm interested in upgrading

364
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,394
my 28.8 kilobaud
Internet connection

365
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,273
to a 1.5 megabit
fiber-optic T-1 line.

366
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,191
Will you be able
to provide an I.P. router

367
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,689
that's compatible
with my token-ring Ethernet

368
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,902
LAN configuration?

369
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,569
Can I have some money now?

370
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,816
Um, is this cage
really necessary?

371
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,487
No talking in the cage.

372
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,405
Court is now in session.

373
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,124
All rise.

374
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,714
Ah-ha! Made you rise.

375
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,539
Your Honor, the defense calls

376
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,844
its first and only witness:
Milhouse Van Houten.

377
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,799
(all gasp and murmur)

378
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,891
Milhouse, did you
steal the food?

379
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,099
Nuh-uh. No way.

380
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,059
Could anyone else
have taken it?

381
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,229
Well... I guess
you could have.

382
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,309
Milhouse, I am defending you.

383
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,595
Oh, sorry.

384
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,268
I'm just saying it was
either you or the monster.

385
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,897
Monster? (scoffs)

386
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,324
Oh, please.

387
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,362
I remind you, we are not here

388
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,485
to debate the existence
of monsters.

389
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,162
ALL: Aw... Too bad.

390
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,831
The defense has just
one more question.

391
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,250
Did any one of you actually see
Milhouse eat the food?

392
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,250
I rest my case.

393
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,876
Prosecutor, your witness.

394
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,894
(grunts) You liar!

395
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,095
You did it, you lying jerk!

396
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,274
Take that! You did it!

397
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,402
Objection!

398
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,608
He's not asking any questions.

399
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,529
Hmm... I'm gonna allow this.

400
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,238
-(grunts)
-Ow! Ow!

401
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,278
Ooh!

402
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,361
Prosecution rests.

403
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,827
After careful deliberation,

404
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,789
it's my opinion that Milhouse
probably did eat the food.

405
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,832
But since there's no proof,

406
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,165
I must find him...

407
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,630
not guilty!

408
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,552
All right!

409
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,298
-(shocked murmurs)
-Aw, man.

410
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,880
But he ate our food!

411
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,466
The law has spoken.

412
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,801
Aah, sucks to the law. (grunts)

413
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,927
(grunts)

414
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,595
Stop! Leave Milhouse alone!

415
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,933
Help me out here, Bart.

416
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,098
I don't know, Lise.

417
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,436
To be honest, that verdict
made me pretty angry.

418
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,151
Bart's with us, law girl.

419
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,401
Step aside.

420
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,993
Hey, man,
leave my sister alone.

421
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,029
Oh, so you're one of them.

422
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,572
(spits)
So be it.

423
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,026
Kill the dorks!

424
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,736
Bash their butts!

425
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,536
Kick their shins!

426
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,370
(all chanting) Kill the dorks!

427
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,075
Bash their butts!

428
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,535
(chanting) Run away.

429
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:15,011
The hunt... is... on.

430
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,097
{\an8}Ooh, they have the Internet
on computers now.

431
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,850
Homer, Bill Gates is here.

432
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,102
{\an8}Bill Gates?

433
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,393
Billionaire computer nerd
Bill Gates?

434
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,357
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Get out of sight, Marge!

435
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,358
I don't want this to look
like a two-bit operation.

436
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,610
Hmm.

437
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,781
Mr. Simpson?

438
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,439
You don't look so rich.

439
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,988
Don't let the haircut fool you.

440
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,281
I'm exceedingly wealthy.

441
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,164
Get a load
of the bowl job, Marge.

442
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,122
Your Internet ad
was brought to my attention,

443
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,372
but I can't figure out what,
if anything,

444
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,624
CompuGlobal HyperMeganet does.

445
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,996
So, rather than risk
competing with you,

446
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,794
I've decided simply
to buy you out.

447
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,167
This is it, Marge.

448
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,384
I poured my heart and soul
into this business,

449
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,134
and now, it's finally
paying off.

450
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,756
We're rich!
Richer than astronauts!

451
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,354
Homer, quiet.
You'll queer the deal.

452
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,009
Oh. Right.

453
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,888
I reluctantly accept
your proposal.

454
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,476
Well, everyone always does.

455
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,152
Buy him out, boys.

456
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,355
Hey, what the hell's going on?

457
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,985
Oh, I didn't get rich
by writing a lot of checks.

458
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,783
(fiendish laughter)

459
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,964
(war cry)

460
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,710
(meows)

461
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,383
(war cry drawing near)

462
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,724
(groans)

463
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,222
I can't go on.

464
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,064
You two go ahead.

465
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,469
And carry me with you.

466
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,977
-You got to be kidding.
-Aw, come on, man.

467
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,899
Hurry! They're catching up!

468
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,435
(gasps)

469
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,282
Here, Milhouse, you go first.

470
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,106
(grunting)

471
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,855
Okay, now throw the vine back.

472
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,276
There's no time!

473
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,414
(grunts)

474
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,950
(war cry)

475
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,834
(grunting)

476
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,048
Look, we can hide in that cave.

477
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,217
(all panting)

478
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,840
LISA: We should be
safe in here.

479
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,217
NELSON: They're trapped
in the cave.

480
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,393
Move in for the kill!

481
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,061
Oh, figs.

482
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,389
(war cry)

483
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:31,936
Stop! You are in violation
of the Model U.N. charter.

484
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:32,942
(all gasp)

485
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,273
Uh, that's right.

486
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,898
The U.N. doesn't look
too kindly on...

487
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,065
The monster!

488
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,663
(snorting)

489
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,908
(all screaming)

490
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,464
Your monster appears
to be nothing

491
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,919
but a run-of-the-mill
wild boar.

492
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,750
Hey, look at his tusk!

493
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,125
So, the boar ate our food.

494
00:20:56,213 --> 00:21:00,013
Oh. Sorry about that whole
trying-to-kill-you thing.

495
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,052
Yeah, well, you should be.

496
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:05,635
I only stole two sandwiches
and a bag of Doritos.

497
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,522
Hey, if a boar
can survive here,

498
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,440
there must be
a source of food.

499
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,939
Look, he's licking
the slime off that rock!

500
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,862
That's what he's been eating--
slime!

501
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,782
And there's enough slime
for all of us!

502
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,320
We're saved!

503
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,751
Mmm. Mmm.

504
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:32,829
All that slime made
this boar extra tender.

505
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,285
More snout anyone?

506
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,997
Mmm. Mmm.

507
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,457
How's your dinner, Lise?

508
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,627
Ah, shut up.

509
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,129
(mutters) Savages.

510
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,297
<i>NARRATOR:</i>

511
