LISA: Mom! Dad! The retirement
home lost its license

33
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:06,900
and Grampa has
nowhere to live!

34
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:07,734
BOTH:
D'oh!

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,080
Oh! That man can't remember
anything except our number!

36
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,697
(sighs)

37
00:02:16,722 --> 00:02:18,002
Get in the car, Dad.

38
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:19,924
Look who's here,
the big dummy!

39
00:02:19,944 --> 00:02:21,778
You do know I'm
a doctor now.

40
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:24,503
Yeah! M.D.!
Major Dummy!

41
00:02:24,516 --> 00:02:26,303
Grampa, what happened?

42
00:02:26,323 --> 00:02:28,099
This place is unlivable.

43
00:02:28,122 --> 00:02:32,170
My contract clearly
promised "barely livable."

44
00:02:32,196 --> 00:02:34,746
Yeah, well, we're closing down
Codger Stadium here

45
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:38,035
until they fix up their violations.
And there are a lot of 'em.

46
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:45,280
Mannequin nurses.

47
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,203
Like I said,
lot of violations.

48
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:55,678
Oh! I guess Grampa's
coming home with us.

49
00:02:55,697 --> 00:02:59,785
Unless... what about that
nice dog boarding place?

50
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:03,072
The really good one, where they
each have their own dog partner.

51
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:05,085
- No kennels!
- You're right.

52
00:03:05,106 --> 00:03:06,874
Bad idea, bad idea.

53
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:10,561
Should we just, you know, drive by
and take a look at the place...?

54
00:03:10,585 --> 00:03:11,612
(groans)

55
00:03:11,638 --> 00:03:13,451
Bad idea. Bad.

56
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,838
When are your relatives
going to be here?

57
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:23,427
Can I be honest with you?
They're not.

58
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,474
We're all alone
in this world.

59
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:28,828
All I have left is a phone
message from my late wife.

60
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:32,858
OLD WOMAN: Pick up the phone, big shot!
I know you're there!

61
00:03:35,608 --> 00:03:37,263
You're both coming home with us.

62
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:39,396
- You mean it?
- Mm-hmm.

63
00:03:39,413 --> 00:03:42,965
Ah, just let me say
good-bye to my girlfriend.

64
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:45,563
Don't get fat.

65
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:50,502
Honey, Grampa is the closest
thing I have to a father,

66
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:53,963
and I love him, but
three octogenorous?

67
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:57,121
Homie, Homie,
we'll be old someday.

68
00:03:57,141 --> 00:03:58,781
(laughs) Speak
for yourself.

69
00:03:58,798 --> 00:04:00,931
Glug-glug-glug.
Chomp-chomp-chomp.

70

73
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:08,312
My lifestyle is my
retirement plan.

74
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:09,575
Oh!

75
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:15,252
- And don't forget my ripple.
- You're not taking your ripple.

76
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:17,319
Without ripple, I never
would have had you.

77
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:18,699
Ripple's your real daddy.

78
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:20,343
(chuckles)

79
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,746
This is gonna be a swell
flophouse, sister.

80
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:26,938
So, where should
we park our pills?

81
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,300
What pills?

82
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,323
- Aah!
- (laughs)

83
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:39,947
Don't worry, Marge.
It's childproof.

84
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:46,586
Oh, oh...

85
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:49,432
Homer, how are we doing
with those cots?

86
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:50,192
(grunts)

87
00:04:50,217 --> 00:04:53,437
Uh... come on, boy.
Your job is to guide me.

88
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,029
Well, I really think you
should watch your temper.

89
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,083
I mean down the stairs,
you stupid kid!

90
00:04:58,092 --> 00:05:01,606
Stupid kid? Do you really think
that's the way we should communicate?

91
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,095
You just want to see your
old man trip and fall.

92
00:05:04,128 --> 00:05:07,215
Well, sorry to disappoint
you, lad, but...

93
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:09,494
What the...?
D'oh! D'oh! Ooh!

94
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:11,724
Not what I was hoping
for, but it'll do.

95
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,746
(cackles)

96
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,416
Okay, boys, shower up.

97
00:05:16,436 --> 00:05:18,697
And I better hear
some towels snapping.

98
00:05:20,107 --> 00:05:21,641
Muntz, what is wrong
with you?

99
00:05:21,662 --> 00:05:24,672
Now, you get undressed in front of
everyone that's staring at you.

100
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,553
(all gasp)

101
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,433
(gasps) Is that
women's underwear?

102
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:35,413
My mom can't afford to buy me
clothes, so I wear her hand-me-downs.

103
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:36,786
(sobs)

104

(children laughing)

105
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:43,487
Muntz, there's a kind of poverty
that toughens you up, but this...

106
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:44,614
is sad.

107
00:05:44,631 --> 00:05:47,261
(children laughing)

108
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:51,307
Hey, leave him alone. I, too, know
the pain of hand-me-down underwear.

109
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,072
My dad buys the underpants
gorillas wear during monkey shows.

110
00:05:55,102 --> 00:05:58,558
So if you're gonna laugh at
Nelson, laugh at me, too.

111
00:06:02,076 --> 00:06:04,075
Simpson, I won't
forget this.

112

how to take care of
you when you're older

Have you seen how he
treats my grampa?

137
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,649
Never visits him.

138
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:39,944
Never even acknowledges
his existence.

139

You may not realize it,
but he's a treasure.

144

GRAMPA: Keep it down in

You know, I love him, too.
In a manly way.

That never shows itself.

149
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:11,669
Now, we're going to need
three hearing aid batteries,

hard to get.

151
00:08:13,808 --> 00:08:17,259

And the butter
has to be open.

153

Oh, I'll see what I can do.

154

Gentlemen, I've

What's your point,
pound cake?

161
00:08:35,869 --> 00:08:39,541
I'm hoping we can find
a way to coexist.

162
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:42,690
- What did he say?
- He wants to see if ghosts exist.

Ooh, they do. My Uncle
Bill is here right now.

164

wasn't a very good ladder holder.

165

That's all right.

Uh, Chief, something

Aw, Lou, you got a
suspicious mind, you know?

171

Uh, uh, "Clambake."

00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,047
The empty swimming pool
from the country club

176
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,080
that closed down rather
than let women in.

177
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:34,413
(coyote howls)

178
00:09:34,465 --> 00:09:38,901
Now, enter the stolen
bicycle graveyard.

179
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:49,832
We've decided to make
you an honorary bully.

180
00:09:49,859 --> 00:09:54,817
Bestow upon him the necklace
of unknown retainers.

181
00:09:56,255 --> 00:09:58,156
Um... thanks,

182
00:09:58,183 --> 00:10:00,752
but I'm not sure I
want to be a bully.

183
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,580
It's too late. You've
seen our faces.

184
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:06,856
(long grunt)

185
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:10,579
Wow, never had breakfast at
6:00 in the morning before.

186
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:14,662
I love yakking at the manager while
he's trying to unlock the door.

187
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:17,443
Now we'll talk about dead
people you never met

188
00:10:17,456 --> 00:10:19,864
while we get a
little exercise.

189
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:21,097
(Homer sighs)

190
00:10:21,117 --> 00:10:22,777
When does
the exercise start?

191
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:25,434
- This is it.
- Yeah, we're mall-walking.

192
00:10:25,451 --> 00:10:28,787
Oh, my God. This
counts as exercise?

193
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:32,223
I'm barely moving and
I'm smelling Cinnebun.

194
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:36,594
Sometimes you have to wait till you're
38 to discover who you really are.

195
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:40,216
I'm a 79-year-old man.

196
00:10:40,232 --> 00:10:42,763
Son, welcome to the club.

197
00:10:46,217 --> 00:10:49,044
Now, say something
pathetic.

198
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:51,129
Uh, okay, um...

199
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,317
Oh, I can't.

200
00:10:53,349 --> 00:10:55,496
That's my boy.

201
00:10:58,122 --> 00:10:59,870
I-25.

202
00:10:59,883 --> 00:11:01,666
- What letter?
- "I."

203
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:03,733
- What number?
- 25.

204
00:11:03,756 --> 00:11:05,623
- What game?
- Bingo!

205
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:07,012
Damn it!

206
00:11:08,553 --> 00:11:11,188
Who's the icebox pie, Abe?

207
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,817
Your younger brother?

208
00:11:12,858 --> 00:11:14,517
My son... but he's taken.

209
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:16,497
Well, I'm not surprised...

210
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,512
the way he tears into
corn on the cob.

211
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:22,068
Now, Mildred, he's
a married man.

212
00:11:22,094 --> 00:11:25,496
You can't see the ring because
his finger's too fat.

213
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:29,824
Join the party, Abe... there's
plenty of room in my bed...

214
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,359
once they take the
railings down.

215
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:36,364
I said beat it! For
the time being.

216
00:11:37,227 --> 00:11:40,306
Now, Homer, you stay away
from those red-door hoochies.

217
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:43,164
They're just trying to get a
chicken dinner out of you.

218
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:44,208
Hmm.

219
00:11:44,256 --> 00:11:46,056
Well, thanks for
the chicken dinner.

220
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:47,669
How did you know
I wanted one?

221
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,940
(chuckles)

222
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:51,839
All you gals like
chicken dinners, Marge.

223
00:11:51,856 --> 00:11:53,449
Don't call me a gal.

224
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:55,102
Makes me feel like
I'm your mother.

225
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:56,223
(shivers)

226
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:59,473
- I better turn up the heat.
- It's 82 degrees.

227
00:12:00,157 --> 00:12:02,974
Huh?
Are you wearing sock garters?

228
00:12:03,008 --> 00:12:06,388
- Young lady, in my day...
- Your day is my day!

229
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:07,713
We're the same age!

230
00:12:07,734 --> 00:12:08,820
(gasps)

231
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:11,268
You're turning
into your father.

232
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,890
(Grampa-like sputtering)

233
00:12:13,925 --> 00:12:18,083
You won't feel so bollixed once my
Social Security checks start coming!

234
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:20,771
They're not coming for
another 29 years.

235
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:21,506
(gasps)

236
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:24,251
Did your ear lobes
get longer?

237
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:25,676
Falsies.

238
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,705

239
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:33,886
(cell phone chimes)

240
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:36,052
Whoa. A tweet
from Chester!

241
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:38,547
- Who's Chester?
- "Who's Chester"?

242
00:12:38,576 --> 00:12:40,729
Just the most legendary
bully of all.

243
00:12:40,752 --> 00:12:44,475
They say he once
wedgied a kid in half.

244
00:12:44,494 --> 00:12:45,955
Whoa.

245
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:48,711
He's calling a bully summit
for next Saturday night.

246
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:52,144
Hey, isn't that the same night the U.S.
figure skating finals are on?

247
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:55,495
They've been promoting
it like hell!

248
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,894
Excuse us, we're
looking for owls.

249
00:12:58,926 --> 00:13:01,253
- Screech or hoot?
- Either one's fine.

250
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:02,531
That was an order!

251
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:04,484
- (hooting)
- Screech! Screech!

252
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:07,937
Where's the Lord
of the Fries?

253
00:13:07,993 --> 00:13:11,546
Actually, Homer got up early
to count and sort pills.

254
00:13:11,569 --> 00:13:14,398
Then he called the police when
a Frisbee landed on our lawn.

255
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:17,017
Then he went to the
drugstore for an egg cream,

256
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:18,557
but he only
brought a nickel.

257
00:13:20,005 --> 00:13:22,058
I didn't mind that
he grew bald.

258
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:25,401
I didn't mind that he got fat. I
didn't mind that he got fatter.

259
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:29,279
But no one told me he'd
get older than me.

260
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:30,888
Oh... (sniffles)

261
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:34,022
Say it, honey... you're no
longer attracted to him.

262
00:13:39,798 --> 00:13:41,409
Maybe.
