Nice going, Bart.

86
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,177
You've ruined Halloween, Thanksgiving,

87
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,430
Christmas and Easter.
The legendary grand slam.

88
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,523
You guys, I swear I didn't do it.

90
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,280
Oh, I don't like the sound
of that funeral march.

91
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,366
Okay, I'll pay for your damn band candy!

92
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,289
What was it, $1,700?

93
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,578
Forget the candy!

94
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,541
We're here to turn this...

95
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,001
into this.

96
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,752
Now do me wearing a sombrero.

97
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,753

98
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,168
Now have me sleeping under a cactus.

99
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,546
-D'oh!
-Hand over your son,

100
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,255
so we can administer "Band Justice."

101
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,386
(plays dramatic music)

102
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,104
I know this looks bad.

103
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,194
And I admit, I would
totally lie in a second

104
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,400
to Lisa or Mom or Dad,

105
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,070
but I would never lie to Maggie.

106
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,649
I did not do that prank.

107
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,616
Wow, he passed the Maggie test.

108
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,001
And remember
how Maggie solved Cookiegate?

109
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,078
All too well.

110
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:35,924
To prove my brother's innocence,
I demand a youth court.

111
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,420
That's right! Bart must not be judged
by these kids,

112
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,716
but by a jury, of kids.

113
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,140
Mostly these kids.

114
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,428
There's only so many kids.

115
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,931
(sighs)

116
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,273
I'm afraid once a youth court
has been demanded,

117
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,439
we are legally obligated
to shut down mob rule,

118
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,228
as decided in the case
of <i>Rubber v. Glue</i>

119
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,113
and reaffirmed by
<i>I Know You Are v. What Am I.</i>

120
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,901
Son, if there's one thing I've learned

121
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:05,315
as a defendant and a juror,
it's stay out of the courtroom.

122
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,276
It's so frickin' boring.

123
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,037
Run, boy! I'll create a distraction.

124
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,041
(playing "Stars and Stripes Forever")

125
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,181

126

127

128
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,444

129
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,523
(music ends)

130
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,782
Anyone can conduct Sousa.

131
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,079
Good news, bad news:

132
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,489
we're allowed to select the judge,

133
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,617
but it's impossible to find
one who doesn't hate you.

134
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,375
I know someone who would
make a great judge.

135
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,458
Would you kids believe your Grampa

136
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,384
once argued in front of the Supreme Court?

137
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,462
-No.
-Sorry.

138
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,047
Not a chance. I mean, it's true.

139
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,513
It was back in 1998.

140
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,223
I say individual rights.

141
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,934
I say the common good.

142
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:15,144
WOMAN: Gentlemen,
our system balances both.

143
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,016
Oh, yeah, and how would you know?

144
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,153
Attorney General Janet Reno?

145
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,110
That's right. And that better not
be your gum on the ground.

146
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,651
Uh, it's not, but I'll take care of it.

147
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,574
Stop doing that.

148
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,446
(chuckles)

149
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,583
This is better than being a real
attorney or a real general.

150
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,751
The attorney general and I
have been playing chess

151
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,371
through the mail ever since.

152
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,628
I find that a little hard to believe.

153
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,130
Yeah, why would you
play chess through the mail

154
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,592
when you can play chess
through the Internet?

155
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,672
Or preferably, not play chess at all?

156
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,377
See here, sass mouth,

157
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,928
you're not too big
for me to tan your hide.

158
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,432
It's not a threat
if I don't know what it means.

159
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,144
I'll fix your wagon!

160
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,434
Thanks. I'd like that.

161
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,347
(muttering)

162
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,862
(scoffs) I get a whiff of the immigrant

163
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,031
from these newfangled superheroes.

164
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,532
Hmm.

165
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:16,537
Reclusive millionaire,
stately mansion, damaged psyche.

166
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,621
(chuckles) He's just like me.

167
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,793
Smithers, I, too, shall become
a crime-fighting bat.

168
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:23,837
Hmm.

169
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,880
But I won't become just any bat.

170
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:29,053
I shall be the terrifying bat
who swoops from the sky

171
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,593
and sucks the vital essence of his prey.

172
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,307
I shall be Fruit Bat Man!

173
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,888
Great, great.

174
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,983
I-I don't suppose you'll be
forgetting about this tomorrow?

175
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,889
No sooner than I'd forget my own mother.

176
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,647
That's not your mother, that's your bear.

177
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,809
Well, then, where's my stuffed mother?

178
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,487
All right, you soft-skulled
nitwits, sit up straight,

179
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,492
because we finally have someone
in this school

180
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,405
who deserves your respect:

181
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,454
former Attorney General Janet Reno.

182
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,498
-(sparse applause)
-Thank you, Gary.

183
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,171
(gasps) Grampa's story was true?

184
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,881
First, I would like to say,
rook to E-8. Checkmate.

185
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:07,883
Dagnabbit!

186
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,474
(laughs)

187
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,629
Youth court is now in session.

188
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,137
God, I love gaveling.

189
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,389
Mr. Prosecutor?

190
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,520
Over the next few days,
you're going to hear

191
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,138
how the defendant, Bartholomew Simpson,

192
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,305
aka the Springfield Egger...

193
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,685
Objection! Prejudicial!

194
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,611
-Sustained.
-(giggles)

195
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,900
She sustained me.

196
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,653
How Bartholomew Simpson wantonly

197
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,895
egged this town
with Milhouse aforethought.

198
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,278
Now, hold on.

199
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,584
Principal Skinner,
are you wearing hard-soled shoes

200
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,828
on this gym floor?

201
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,659
No, ma'am. Sneakers.

202
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,334
You're wearing sneakers to a trial?

203
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,254
Oh, God, the press is gonna have
a field day with this.

204
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,463
Yay, field day!

205
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,923
I can go cuckoo and no one can stop me!

206
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,514
That's exactly what George W. Bush said

207
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,670
when he was inaugurated.

208
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,837
People don't remember that.

209
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,175
This case is going great.

210
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,140
Although as usual, I look nothing like
the courtroom artist's drawing.

211
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,104
BART: Nice try, Pop.

212
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,519
Very dramatic, sir.

213
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,315
A little more brooding, and...

214
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,228
there's my superhero.

215
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,487
-Now let's get you to bed and...
-Hist. Look there.

216
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,695
This looks like a job for Fruit Bat Man.

217
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,661
(screeches)

218
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,702
Perhaps we should, uh,
just call the police.

219
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,155
The police? Bah!
Every last man on the take.

220
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,117
And I should know,
because I'm on the give.

221
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,037
I've never felt more alive!

222
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,632
Look, I'll give you each
$1,000 if you pretend to let

223
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,545
that old man out there stop this crime.

224
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,554
Mm.

225
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,296
Mm.

226
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,887
Feel the crumbling fist of justice!

227
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,433
-(grunts)
-Ouchers.

228
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,096
Oh, dear.

229
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,145
Who are you, mysterious
octogenarian of the night?

230
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,399
I am the squeak in the rafters,

231
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,032
the flutter in the chimney,

232
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,148
the tiny teeth marks in the peach.

233
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,235
I am Fruit Bat Man.

234
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:59,161
Now back to my natural realm,
the inky night.

235
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,162
D'oh!

236
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:07,666
I'll just take one of
these key chain penlights.

237
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,790
You have to keep squeezing this thing?

238
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,417
Who has the strength for that?

239
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,722
So when I came in,
the Monday after Easter,

240
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,760
I noticed three dozen eggs missing.

241
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,263
And do you think this boy took those eggs?

242
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,136
Him?
All he takes are sodas and desserts.

243
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,984
Objection! Unhealthy!

244
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,769
But could Bart
have gotten those eggs?

245
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,192
No way.

246
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,770
They were under lock and key.

247
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,145
(gallery gasps)

248
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,072
No one could have touched those eggs

249
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,530
except me and the seagulls that laid them.

250
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,111
No further questions.

251
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,948
Ah, to be young and on trial.

252
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,873
♪♪

253
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,939
(yells gibberish)

254
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:21,238
A toast to our enigmatic new protector,

255
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,123
who certainly isn't me.

256
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,870
Smithers, wink my eye.

257
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,834
Want to hit the hot tub, Burnsie?

258
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,754
Well, I hate to get all pruney,

259
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,503
but heated tubbery
is what we playboys do.

260
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,586
Great work, everyone. That's a wrap.

261
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,680
It's nice to make an old man
feel good about himself.

262
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,760
You said it.

263
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,347
So Bart couldn't have taken the eggs.

264
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,102
I was with him the whole weekend.

265
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,694
You'd make up any lie

266
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,229
for that Simpson boy, wouldn't you?

267
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,062
Yeah, but I'd pee my pants.

268
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,818
Nelson.

269
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,570
Dry as a bone.

270
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,451
(sighs)

271
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:02,658
Now, that's what I call "legal briefs."

272
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,700
Why are you here?

273
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,833
I thought of the joke and rushed over.

274
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,754
Your Honor, I think we've seen enough.

275
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,999
I have demolished the prosecution's claims

276
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,251
and made the prosecutor
sweat through two shirts.

277
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,875
I move that you dismiss this case

278
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,511
and release this sweet, lovable boy.

279
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,009
-Motion denied.
-(gasps)

280
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:24,761
Miss Simpson, your grandstanding
summation contained a grievous error.

281
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,805
By calling your brother sweet and lovable,

282
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,889
you opened the door to testimony

283
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,354
from anyone who doesn't think
he's sweet and lovable.

284
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,435
The prosecution calls
everyone in the world!

285
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,862
(gallery gasps)

286
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,775
Mr. Szyslak,

287
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,247
what name did the defendant ask for

288
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,118
when he called you at your bar?

289
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,705
He asked for, um...

290
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,830
(clears throat)

291
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,206
...Mike Rotch.

292
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,132
And then what did you say?

293
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,131
Well, I said, um...

294
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,843
I said, "Mike Rotch."

295
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,683
Um, "Mike Rotch."

296
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,219
And then I...

297
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,972
(sobbing) I'm sorry.

298
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,474
Take all the time you need.

299
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,636
I, uh, I, uh, I yelled out,

300
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,725
"Has anybody seen Mike Rotch?"

301
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,942
(gallery murmuring)

302
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,861
See, they... (sobs)

303
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,030
See, they thought I was asking
if anybody wanted to see...

304
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,990
my-my...

305
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,950
Oh, man, this is so painful.

306
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:29,451
(sobbing) My crotch.

307
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,695
(gallery gasps)

308
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,365
Thank you for your bravery today.

309
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,127
I just had to make sure that he never
did this to another bartender.

310
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,875
Pass the gravy, Gloria All-Wrong.

311
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,635
The trial's not over, and
gravy is dead animal juice.

312
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,139
Hmm?

313
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,641
Hmm.

314
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,233
Just remember this:
a Simpson never gives up.

315
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,020
(laughter)

316
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,483
You got to be kidding!

317
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,737
(knocking)

318
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,823
(tires screech)

319
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,619
(gasps) A civilian.
She mustn't know I'm a hero.

320
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,740
Gouge her eyes out.

321
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,541
Mr. Burns,

322
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,791
I came here because my brother

323
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,832
is about to be wrongfully convicted,

324
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,416
and the man I'm looking for

325
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,920
would help me find the truth.

326
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,342
Don't you get it?
I don't care who you are or what you want.

327
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,921
(groans)

328
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,586
Now get lost.

329
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,014
(groans)

330
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,797
I think you just sent away
the first person

331
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,927
you could have actually helped.

332
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,814
What do you mean, "actually"?

333
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,021
I've punched out four Homer Simpson
shaped burglars tonight alone.

334
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,442
All those crooks were fakes, set up by me.

335
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:42,021
(gasps)
Even the Abominable Dr. Lenny?

336
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,817
No, he was a happy accident.

337
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,691
But the rest were fakes, just like you,

338
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,858
a man who claims to be
a hero but is nothing more

339
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,367
than a fraud with a cute little bod.

340
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,787
They're calling for you, sir,
but who's gonna answer?

341
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,499
MAN: Ah!

342
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,544
What the hell is that?!

343
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,009
And so I've learned that
the only true Batmen

344
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,967
are Christian Bale and Adam West.

345
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,977
Why are you washing
Bumblebee Man's pants?

346
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,730
I volunteered to wash the egg stains
off everyone's clothes.

347
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,484
It's one of those things you say
and hope nobody takes you up on it.

348
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,025
-That's odd.
-What's odd?

349
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,452
This skirt has a small splatter.

350
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,990
-Splatter?
-Splatter as if the egg

351
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,623
had been crushed against it by hand.

352
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,910
-I don't follow.
-Like someone faked being hit,

353
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,164
so they wouldn't be a suspect.

354
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,035
Interesting, except you missed one thing.

355
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,832
-What's that?
-It's not a skirt.

356
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,035
It's a kilt!

357
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,919
Oh, the wood chipper.
Is there any sweeter music?

358
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,638
-MARGE: Why'd you do it, Willie?
-(screams)

359
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,719
Because the world is better off
with four fewer Welshmen!

360
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,385
Wait, what are we talking about?

361
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,733
This kilt says you framed my brother. Why?

362
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,650
Because I hate Easter.

363
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,899
You see, ladies,
I'm not just a Presbyterian,

364
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,742
I'm a Scottish Old Believer Presbyterian!

365
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,606
Old Believers don't recognize holidays

366
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,237
not celebrated by the original apostles,

367
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,334
especially one named after

368
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,000
the pagan god, Eostre!

369
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,999
But how did you get the key?

370
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,461
I made sweet love
to Lunchlady Dora,

371
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,132
<i>then copied the key as she slept.</i>

372
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,210
(snoring, metal grinding)

373
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,546
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

374
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,300
Now, as for your evidence...

375
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,851
(cackles)

376
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:38,138
Behold, the pointed ears of justice.

377
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,142
Ah! A human fruit bat!

378
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,810
(engine starts)

379
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,741
(gasping)

380
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,609
You're so light.
It's like fighting a silk scarf!

381
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,197
Or a kimono sash!

382
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:59,042
Yes, feel the weightless
tickle of justice.

383
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,869
-(gasps)
-(screams)

384
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,745
(engine chugging)

385
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,216
Which side won? Good or evil?

386
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,760
-Good.
-And which side was I on?

387
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,014
-Also good.
-(chuckles) Well, there's two surprises.

388
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,598
Will the defendant please rise?

389
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:27,154
It's amazing how much exercise
I've gotten from those words.

390
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,521
BURNS: Pause the inquisition!

391
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,607
(gallery gasps)

392
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,111
Behold the real egg-flinging fiend.

393
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,114
Aye, 'tis true.

394
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,446
I pulled the prank,
for some daft Scottish reason.

395
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:41,123
I'd fire that man if he weren't
so damned good at what he does.

396
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,253
We have a school
full of professionals, sir.

397
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,120
Really? Where is that school?

398
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,537
Inside your head?

399
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,165
Another mystery solved
by Attorney General Janet Reno.

400
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,634
Case dismissed.

401
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,303
(cheering)

402
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,222
You saved me, Lis.

403
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,850
For the rest of my life, you'll
always be my one phone call.

404
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,389
Aw, but I do hope you'll try
to be good from now on.

405
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,314
Don't need to; I got you.

406
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,733
-(gavel bangs)
-Children, let me be clear.

407
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,692
Despite what happened here,

408
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,942
last minute confessions,
shackled Scotsman

409
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:14,404
and meddling billionaires are
not how the legal system works.

410
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,066
Well, the last one is.

411
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,155
Today, you were truly a hero.
Thank you.

412
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,331
Excellent.

413
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,489
You know, if you're gonna be a hero,

414
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,828
you might not want to tent
your fingers like that.

415
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,173
Is this better?

416
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,668
Maybe you should wrap your hands
behind your head.

417
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,090
Maybe I should wrap them around
your gabby little throat.

418
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,090
Ah! Tenting, tenting! Back to the tenting!

419
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,763
(phone ringing)

420
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,390
Acquitted?

421
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,179
Then my nightmare isn't over!

422
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,603
(sobbing)

423
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,772
-(phone ringing)
-(gasps)

424
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,357
{\an8}<i>(Moe sobbing)</i>

425
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:01,411
Well, Fruit Bat Man,
it seems you're no match for me,

426
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,411
the Abominable Dr. Lenny!

427
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,953
(laughs maniacally)

428
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,796
Gentlemen, this threat is too great
for just one elderly hero.

429
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,970
We have no choice but to activate

430
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,429
The Octogenarian Initiative.

431
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,349
<i>The Rambler...</i>

432
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,558
And then there was the time
I taught a dog to make oatmeal.

433
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,020
(snoring)

434
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,229
<i>Early Bird...</i>

435
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,306
<i>Hot Flash...</i>

436
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,780
<i>Iron Lung.</i>

437
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,779
It is time to pull up...

438
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,911
<i>The Dependables.</i>

439
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,909
-I open one, no trump.
-Double.

440
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,955
You've just made a powerful enemy.

441
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,291
Shh!
