1
00:00:46,676 --> 00:00:47,581
D'oh!

2
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:49,342
I don't even want to smell
sparkling apple juice again.

3
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,244
Aw. Poor baby.

4
00:01:54,382 --> 00:01:55,816
Come on, Bart.

5
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:57,384
Afraid of a little
apple juice?

6
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,687
Pig in a blanket!
Dad's underwear.

7
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:02,289
Aunt Selma's leg.

8
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,024
I hate New Year's Eve.

9
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:06,159
I can't believe I made out

10
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:08,895
with Ryan Seacrest
on the TV screen.

11
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:11,765
Let's just
take it easy.

12
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,768
We all made mistakes
on New Year's Eve.

13
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,341
There's only one
upside to today.

14
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:25,695
Come on,
just one more drink, Marge.

15
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,864
Happy New Year!

16
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:29,616
Aah!

17
00:02:29,684 --> 00:02:32,285
Everyone shush!

18
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:33,854
Why are you hungover?

19
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:35,088
I didn't see you drink
last night.

20
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:36,857
I didn't.

21
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:39,459
I got secondhand wasted
from smooching your father.

22
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:42,929
So not a peep out of anyone
till the Fiesta Bowl.

23
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,831
That's not
for five hours.

24
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:46,867
I know when the freaking
Fiesta Bowl is!

25
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:48,368
Sweetie, relax.

26
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:50,670
Let's just watch some TV.

27
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,007
New Year's Eve might be over

28
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:56,877
in America, but we're still
rocking hard in Samoa.

29
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:59,146
And here come the Blue Angels

30
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:01,748
waking up the shrieking
wah-wah birds.

31
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:15,762
Well, well, well.

32
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,264
Simpson, you've committed

33
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:19,366
Springfield's first
crime of the new year.

34
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,801
Write him up, Lou.

35
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,302
Huh? What'd I do?

36
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,837
Failed to separate

37
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:26,206
your bottles
and newspapers.

38
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:27,774
50 bucks?!

39
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:29,776
That used to cover
two public nudities

40
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:32,412
and a poop in the park.

41
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:34,881
Aah! That's vandalizing
city property.

42
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,284
Write him up
again, Lou.

43
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:39,853
What the hell?!
Mild obscenity before 10:00 a.m.

44
00:03:39,921 --> 00:03:41,454
Also illegal.

45
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,190
Come on, Lou.
Give me a break.

46
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:45,659
Sorry, sir.
I take no pleasure in it.

47
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,427
♪ Da-da-da, dee,
da-da-da, da-hah ♪

48
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:48,695
Oh, yeah.

49
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:52,599
Since when is all this
against the law?

50
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,000
Since today.

51
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,837
As of Jan one,
a bunch of new ordinances--

52
00:03:56,904 --> 00:04:00,173
with, uh, outrageous financial
penalties-- took effect.

53
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,775
Oh, I get it.

54
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:03,276
The government runs out
of money,

55
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:04,911
so they pass a bunch
of lame-o laws

56
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,813
to sock it to the little guy.

57
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:08,248
Fine. You're telling
it like it is.

58
00:04:08,316 --> 00:04:09,850
Also a crime now.

59
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:10,917
And that one's
going to cost you.

60
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:15,655
That's almost $1,000!

61
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:18,058
Rounding up your total--
that's a $50 fine.

62
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,896
Wow, Homer.
This year's only 11 hours old,

63
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:25,265
and it's already
your annus horribilis.

64
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,667
My New Year's resolution
was to learn Latin.

65
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:31,037
Uh, listen, Homer--
I know a guy who fixes things

66
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,873
for folks who need
things fixed.

67
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,375
But, uh, I can't talk
about it here.

68
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,846
Eh, still not private enough.

69
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:42,649
Uh, this is private,
but a little dank.

70
00:04:44,252 --> 00:04:46,753
Uh, whoopsie.

71
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:49,589
Glinda, Madame Morrible,
flying monkeys there,

72
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:52,893
can you tell me how I can
get back to my bar?

73
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,963
Moe, you've always had the
power to get back to the bar.

74
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,368
Whoa! It's a chimpan-me.

75
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:20,453
Maybe we should let these
people enjoy their show.

76
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,259
Homer, what you do

77
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,295
is go down to window
nine at the courthouse.

78
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,297
You slip the
guy 100 bucks,

79
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,466
and your record
is as clean as...

80
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:36,769
Uh, I ain't got nothing,
uh, clean to compare it to.

81
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,541
Ten minutes?

82
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,242
I can't wait that long.

83
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,111
I left an ice cream cone
in my cup holder.

84
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,815
Hold on. I will get help.

85
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,884
Must break glass.

86
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,725
No!

87
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,732
Homer Simpson, you
are under arrest

88
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,202
for attempted bribery
of a public official.

89
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:12,605
Chief, this is just
a big misunderstanding.

90
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:15,174
I meant to write "bride."

91
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,210
It's a wedding
present.

92
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:18,744
Oh, how thoughtful.

93
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,313
Aah! My bribe!

94
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,714
Cuff him, Lou.

95
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:27,053
Oh, this is supposed to be
the happiest day of my life,

96
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,155
and it's ruined.

97
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,624
Homer Simpson, you
are hereby sentenced

98
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:34,627
to ten years
in the federal penitentiary.

99
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:36,195
It's okay. It's okay.

100
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,598
I can be out in 18 months
with good behavior.

101
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:39,932
We're Simpsons, Dad.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,701
We don't do
good behavior.

103
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,237
Don't tell me I'm not capable
of good behavior!

104
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:51,777
Your Honor, I would like
to request a sidebar.

105
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,179
Granted.

106
00:07:01,865 --> 00:07:03,098
Ten years.

107
00:07:04,177 --> 00:07:06,645
That is a long time to be
away from your family.

108
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:11,302
All that time I'll be stuck
in my cell, unable to exercise.

109
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,838
Actually, most convicts
work out like crazy.

110
00:07:13,906 --> 00:07:16,908
I repeat: unable to exercise.

111
00:07:16,976 --> 00:07:18,877
Look, Simpson,
there is one thing

112
00:07:18,944 --> 00:07:20,812
you can do
to get out sooner,

113
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,148
but, uh, it is
extremely dangerous.

114
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,784
Simpson, we are
currently conducting

115
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:27,752
a 20-year investigation

116
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,989
into the activities of
Anthony "Fat Tony" D'Amico.

117
00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:32,824
What, this guy?

118
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:36,327
Oops.

119
00:07:39,065 --> 00:07:40,598
We're going to plant you

120
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,834
in Fat Tony's gang
as an undercover informant.

121
00:07:42,902 --> 00:07:44,536
I can't go undercover
with Fat Tony.

122
00:07:44,603 --> 00:07:45,837
He's met me.

123
00:07:45,905 --> 00:07:47,305
I've been in his house.

124
00:07:47,373 --> 00:07:50,008
I was briefly
his "conserigliary..."

125
00:07:50,076 --> 00:07:54,245
consugly... canoliar...
Robert Duvall.

126
00:07:54,313 --> 00:07:56,748
Everyone knows Fat Tony,
so we're going to plant you

127
00:07:56,816 --> 00:07:59,184
in the prison with a
disguise and a new name.

128
00:07:59,251 --> 00:08:00,719
Can I be Johnny Undercover?

129
00:08:00,786 --> 00:08:01,920
That's a little obvious.

130
00:08:01,987 --> 00:08:03,722
Okay. Melvin Mafia.

131
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:05,423
No. You will be known

132
00:08:05,491 --> 00:08:07,792
as Nicky "Blue Pants"
Altosaxophony.

133
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,527
Can I keep the name
after I'm done?

134
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:11,496
No. It belongs to the government.
Oh.

135
00:08:11,564 --> 00:08:13,598
No ice cream available!

136
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:14,916
Children, stay away!

137
00:08:17,803 --> 00:08:19,504
Now, pay attention.

138
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:21,122
We're going to move
in on Fat Tony

139
00:08:21,207 --> 00:08:23,341
when he takes delivery on a
shipment of Belgian guns.

140
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:25,376
In your left sideburn
is a fiber-optic camera.

141
00:08:25,444 --> 00:08:27,345
In your right,
a wireless mic.

142
00:08:27,413 --> 00:08:29,180
To zoom in, you go, "Ayyy!"

143
00:08:29,248 --> 00:08:31,783
To zoom out, go, "Ohhh!"

144
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:35,820
Ayyy. Ohhh! Ayyy. Ohhh!

145
00:08:35,888 --> 00:08:37,922
Forget-about-it!

146
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,457
That activates
the auto-destruct.

147
00:08:41,694 --> 00:08:44,763
Dear Lord, watch over
my sweet Homie

148
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,831
while he's in
the hoosegow.

149
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:48,666
Keep him safe
from shanks and shivs.

150
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:50,635
Let him become rich
in the jail yard currencies

151
00:08:50,703 --> 00:08:52,670
of cigarettes and dried fish.

152
00:08:59,578 --> 00:09:01,412
Uh, what's my
name again?

153
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,714
Okay, I'm coming.

154
00:09:04,283 --> 00:09:05,850
I'd like a third
helping, please.

155
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:09,120
You do know the meat is made
from diseased pigeons.

156
00:09:09,188 --> 00:09:11,422
Just get the ladle
down there deep.

157
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,258
That's where
the beaks are.

158
00:09:16,195 --> 00:09:18,630
Hey, you're that guy
from the FB-- mmph!

159
00:09:18,697 --> 00:09:19,964
Time to go to work.

160
00:09:20,032 --> 00:09:21,900
Stop licking my hand.

161
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:23,935
There was
barbecue sauce on it.

162
00:09:24,003 --> 00:09:25,937
Here's how it goes down:
I rough up Louie.

163
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:28,206
Then you stand up to me,
earning his trust.

164
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:31,643
But I haven't earned his trust
if it's based on a lie.

165
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,344
Enough of your
dime-store morality.

166
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:34,813
What's a dime store?

167
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,648
I...

168
00:09:38,984 --> 00:09:40,919
Aah!

169
00:09:40,986 --> 00:09:42,754
Blue pants power!

170
00:09:42,821 --> 00:09:44,122
Ow! Hey.

171
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,925
Hey, Nicky Blue,
you're one tough yegg.

172
00:09:46,992 --> 00:09:49,360
If you come out of your
beating in one piece,

173
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:51,229
you and I should
have a face-to-face.

174
00:09:51,297 --> 00:09:52,664
Beating? What beating?

175
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:55,700
Oh, that beating.

176
00:09:59,238 --> 00:10:00,772
Don't worry. We're not
going to touch you.

177
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,340
We'll make it sound
like a beating

178
00:10:02,408 --> 00:10:04,108
by tenderizing
these steaks.

179
00:10:04,176 --> 00:10:05,710
Can I have any of the steaks?

180
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:06,945
No.

181
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:14,219
That's so mean!

182
00:10:14,286 --> 00:10:17,722
Whoa! I'm impressed over here
with that guy over there.

183
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,607
Please! Let me have it!

184
00:10:21,026 --> 00:10:22,126
Come on!

185
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:23,995
Give it to me
right in the mouth!

186
00:10:32,037 --> 00:10:34,973
Well, back in my keister you go.

187
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,443
We brought someone
to spring you.

188
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,779
Now, let us escort
you to freedom.

189
00:10:41,847 --> 00:10:42,981
How are you going to do that?

190
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:44,816
Let's just say this prison

191
00:10:44,884 --> 00:10:47,952
was built
by Mob construction workers.

192
00:10:56,595 --> 00:10:57,929
He's in.

193
00:10:57,997 --> 00:10:59,764
Aw, for-- I was
going to say that!

194
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:02,734
What's going on?

195
00:11:02,801 --> 00:11:05,670
I called the prison and they
won't tell me where Homer is.

196
00:11:05,738 --> 00:11:07,472
Sorry, Marge,
I can't tell you.

197
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:10,675
If it makes you feel better, I
can tell you about someone else.

198
00:11:10,743 --> 00:11:14,012
Ooh! How about Krusty
in the drunk tank? Aha.

199
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,148
If, if Jews control the media,

200
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:21,352
why can't I get on
Jimmy Kimmel, huh? Huh?

201
00:11:27,593 --> 00:11:29,961
So. What do you think
of the sauce?

202
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:34,132
I detect a distinct
lack of oregano.

203
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:36,734
I'll take care of this.

204
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,505
You carry oregano with you?

205
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:43,908
Oregano, basil,
rosemary...

206
00:11:43,976 --> 00:11:46,010
I-I think I got a ketchup
packet for you, boss.

207
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:48,746
Did you order French fries
and not use it?

208
00:11:48,814 --> 00:11:51,416
Well, they gave me two packets,
but I only needed one.

209
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:55,119
What other secrets
are you hiding from me?

210
00:11:55,187 --> 00:11:58,222
I-I-I bring my own candy
to the movie theater.

211
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,325
Louie...

212
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:10,201
My beloved Anna Maria.

213
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:14,305
I hope Heaven's powder room
is painted that eggshell blue

214
00:12:14,373 --> 00:12:16,841
you could never
achieve on Earth.

215
00:12:21,847 --> 00:12:23,414
Sorry, boss.

216
00:12:23,482 --> 00:12:25,483
No apology necessary.

217
00:12:25,551 --> 00:12:27,368
I am touched.

218
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:30,054
You and me, Nicky.
We feel.

219
00:12:30,122 --> 00:12:34,192
Legs, Louie, Jimmy the Axe,
Tommy the Face-Shooter--

220
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:36,494
they never share my grief.

221
00:12:36,562 --> 00:12:40,598
Yeah. Those guys are
probably FBI informants.

222
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,301
You think an informant
could get that close to me?

223
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:44,602
Oh, yeah.

224
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,405
I got in your gang, and you
barely know who I am.

225
00:12:47,473 --> 00:12:49,640
That is good
counsel indeed.

226
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,643
You have earned my complete,
unquestioning trust.

227
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:55,013
But first,
one little thing.

228
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,016
You must make your bones.

229
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:01,152
Wh-What are
we doing here?

230
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,488
I will tell you.

231
00:13:03,555 --> 00:13:07,558
<i>When I call for my Russian</i>
<i>business partner, Yuri Nator,</i>

232
00:13:07,626 --> 00:13:09,527
<i>I don't expect</i>
<i>to be screamed at</i>

233
00:13:09,595 --> 00:13:12,830
<i>like I was some ten-year-old</i>
<i>punk making a prank call.</i>

234
00:13:12,898 --> 00:13:15,466
Yuri Nator?
Yuri Nator!

235
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:18,302
Hey, my mouth is begging
for a Yuri Nator!

236
00:13:20,105 --> 00:13:21,906
Be careful what
you wish for.

237
00:13:21,974 --> 00:13:24,542
Why, you... I'm going to
chop you into little pieces,

238
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,044
and make you
into a Rubik's cube,

239
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:27,912
which I will never solve!

240
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:32,316
Well, I guess
I could tell him

241
00:13:32,384 --> 00:13:34,218
he could improve
his phone etiquette.

242
00:13:34,286 --> 00:13:37,622
Tell him with fire.

243
00:13:37,689 --> 00:13:39,257
Ooh-hoo.

244
00:13:39,324 --> 00:13:41,192
What's the matter, Nicky?

245
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,428
You got a problem
with this job?

246
00:13:43,495 --> 00:13:45,763
Oh, no, no!
I was, uh, just thinking

247
00:13:45,831 --> 00:13:48,032
how cheap this crime
would've been in the 70's,

248
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,284
when gas was 35 cents a gallon.

249
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,535
It was either this,
or put in a ladies' room.

250
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:12,712
Exquisite.

251
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:15,481
As a reward, I've planned
a little surprise for you.

252
00:14:17,284 --> 00:14:21,120
This is horrible!
I keep smelling my own breath!

253
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:22,688
Nicolas Blue Pants,

254
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:24,891
you have shown
great fazagabool

255
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,594
in the face of overwhelming
spoogatzagatini.

256
00:14:28,662 --> 00:14:31,097
Huh?

257
00:14:34,568 --> 00:14:36,435
You're a made man, my friend.
Welcome!

258
00:14:36,503 --> 00:14:37,837
Ooh...

259
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:41,741
Nicky, welcome to
the family.

260
00:14:41,808 --> 00:14:45,278
From now on, you don't know
where you end and we begin.

261
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:47,580
Your problems
are our problems.

262
00:14:47,648 --> 00:14:49,415
My neck is kind of itchy.

263
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:51,634
Then all of our necks are itchy.

264
00:14:51,718 --> 00:14:53,853
Now that you mention it, itchy like crazy!
I gotta shave my back.

265
00:14:53,921 --> 00:14:55,354
Aw.

266
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,825
Nicky, my friend,

267
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:02,528
tonight is a big score I've
been setting up for months.

268
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:07,733
<i>Just you and me.</i>

269
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:09,735
Sharing it together.

270
00:15:09,803 --> 00:15:12,371
To heterosexual
male friendship,

271
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:15,074
the kind the Greeks
wrote about.

272
00:15:16,143 --> 00:15:17,276
Huh?

273
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:22,081
Here they are!
My Belgian guns.

274
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:25,351
Belgian guns. I've been waiting
half my life for this moment.

275
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:26,819
All units, move in!

276
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:28,487
Tony, you got to get
out of here, now!

277
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:29,522
What? Why?

278
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,591
Don't ask questions, just go!

279
00:15:31,642 --> 00:15:34,093
What's gotten into you?
You're as nervous as a cat

280
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:36,662
when Johnny Kick-A-Cat
walks into the room.

281
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,631
<i>Verlaat de vuurwapens</i>

282
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:41,033
<i>op het dok en wij kunnen</i>
<i>een Chimay bier drinken!</i>

283
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:43,603
Get a shot of
Tony with the guns.

284
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,904
Um, eh...

285
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:46,272
Closer.

286
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,174
Ayyy...
Too close.

287
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:49,442
Ohhh!
Closer.

288
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:50,943
Ayyy.

289
00:15:52,646 --> 00:15:53,713
Too close.
Ohhh!

290
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,347
Perfect.

291
00:15:54,414 --> 00:15:56,549
Wait a minute.

292
00:16:00,787 --> 00:16:02,455
How could you, Nicky?

293
00:16:02,522 --> 00:16:04,590
I would have
given you everything.

294
00:16:04,658 --> 00:16:06,258
In the strip club
of my heart,

295
00:16:06,326 --> 00:16:08,327
you held the key to
the champagne room.

296
00:16:08,395 --> 00:16:10,463
I loved you, man.

297
00:16:15,902 --> 00:16:17,470
He's dead.

298
00:16:17,537 --> 00:16:20,606
No. You're wrong! Check again!

299
00:16:20,674 --> 00:16:21,841
Forget-about-it.

300
00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:43,835
Homer, I just want to say

301
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:46,558
that of all the rat bastards
we've had working for us,

302
00:16:46,658 --> 00:16:47,796
you were the snitchiest.

303
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:49,897
So that's it. You
used me to kill a man,

304
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:52,266
and all I get is a
handshake and a blanket?

305
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:54,735
We didn't say you
could use the blanket.

306
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:57,371
And I'm not gonna
shake your hand.

307
00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:00,074
Poor Tony.
He didn't deserve this.

308
00:17:00,142 --> 00:17:03,611
He was just a soldier
in a war he started.

309
00:17:07,716 --> 00:17:11,152
Homie, I know you had
a terrible experience,

310
00:17:11,219 --> 00:17:12,586
but it's over.

311
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:15,656
It's not over, Marge.
It'll never be over.

312
00:17:15,724 --> 00:17:18,926
When I shut my eyes, all I see
is Fat Tony and me

313
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:21,162
having drinks
at that bar on the beach.

314
00:17:21,229 --> 00:17:23,397
You never took me to
that bar on the beach.

315
00:17:23,465 --> 00:17:25,800
Oh. Well, uh...

316
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:28,269
you wouldn't like it;
it's not very good.

317
00:17:28,336 --> 00:17:29,737
Sounds pretty good.

318
00:17:29,805 --> 00:17:32,073
No, no, I oversold it.

319
00:17:40,982 --> 00:17:43,284
I'd give anything
to bring you back.

320
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,954
Wake up, Homer.

321
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:49,123
Huh? Wha...?

322
00:17:49,191 --> 00:17:50,958
Fat Tony.

323
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:53,861
No. I'm his cousin
from San Diego--

324
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:56,997
Fit Tony.

325
00:17:57,065 --> 00:18:01,335
Wow, I've never seen a mobster
use a track suit for exercising.

326
00:18:01,403 --> 00:18:05,339
And there's no better exercise
than killing and disemboweling

327
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:07,808
a big, fat snitch.

328
00:18:07,876 --> 00:18:09,143
I understand.

329
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:11,011
I loved him too.

330
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,819
Your tears seem
in no way crocodilian.

331
00:18:18,887 --> 00:18:20,454
Do what you got to do.

332
00:18:20,522 --> 00:18:22,289
The quicker you
kill me up here,

333
00:18:22,357 --> 00:18:24,225
the quicker he can
kill me down there.

334
00:18:26,828 --> 00:18:28,863
Join me on the
elliptical machines.

335
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,232
I will let you live for...

336
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:33,968
20 minutes.

337
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:41,008
I worked for Fat Tony.

338
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:42,943
And he was the best
boss I ever had.

339
00:18:43,011 --> 00:18:44,945
Well. This is awkward.

340
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:47,381
What? Oh, uh, Mr. Burns!

341
00:18:47,449 --> 00:18:49,583
Uh, you were cool, too.

342
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:54,288
Oh, I so believe that.

343
00:18:54,356 --> 00:18:58,025
He took me to a fight that
he fixed, but he never let on,

344
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:00,711
not even when I bet $500
on the wrong guy.

345
00:19:02,764 --> 00:19:05,099
Then he said he would
dope a horse for me.

346
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:08,435
Homer, it is time...

347
00:19:08,503 --> 00:19:12,006
to switch your elliptical
machine to cool-down mode.

348
00:19:12,073 --> 00:19:15,176
Are you going to kill me now?
'Cause I'm super ready.

349
00:19:15,243 --> 00:19:18,746
No. Because my cousin
lives on in your memories.

350
00:19:18,813 --> 00:19:20,347
And to extinguish you

351
00:19:20,415 --> 00:19:23,083
would be to whack
what still remains of him.

352
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:26,820
Wow. The killers
have been kind to me.

353
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:28,889
While the people who are
supposed to protect me

354
00:19:28,957 --> 00:19:30,291
treated me like dirt!

355
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:32,059
What kind of
a world is this?

356
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:33,444
It's pretty screwed-up.

357
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:35,746
That's why I keep
my friends close.

358
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,198
And your enemies closer?

359
00:19:37,249 --> 00:19:38,799
No, why would I do that?

360
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:41,168
If they were close,
they would kill me.

<i>Fit Tony took</i>
<i>his cousin's place</i>

362
00:19:42,637 --> 00:19:44,872
<i>running the Springfield mob.</i>

363
00:19:46,858 --> 00:19:52,213
<i>The pressures got to him,</i>
<i>so he started to eat.</i>

364
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,816
<i>Soon, he was known as</i>
<i>"Fit Fat Tony,"</i>

365
00:19:55,884 --> 00:19:57,384
<i>then just "Fat Tony" for short.</i>

366
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:02,790
<i>And me?</i>

367
00:20:02,857 --> 00:20:05,292
<i>Now I'm just an average schnook</i>
<i>like everyone else,</i>

368
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,994
<i>stuck in this backwater burg</i>

369
00:20:07,062 --> 00:20:09,196
<i>where all you can count on</i>
<i>is your family,</i>

370
00:20:09,264 --> 00:20:11,999
<i>and the only one who ever</i>
<i>shot anyone is the baby.</i>

371
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:15,269
<i>I have to admit,</i>
<i>it's a pretty good life.</i>
