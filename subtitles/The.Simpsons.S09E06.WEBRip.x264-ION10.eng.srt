Halfback passes to the center.

45
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,267
Back to the wing.

46
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,312
Back to the center.

47
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,364
Center holds it.

48
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,355
Holds it.

49
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,324
Holds it. (sighs)

50
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,034
Halfback passes to center! Back to wing!

51
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:20,493
Back to center! Center holds it!
Holds it! Holds it!

52
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,075
I can't bear this any longer. I'm leaving!

53
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,081
Yeah, not before me you ain't.

54
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,333
Now, now, there's plenty
of exits for everyone.

55
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,206
Oh, that's it. You're dead, pal!

56
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,883
-Hey, now, that's uncalled for.
-Shut your hole, Skinner!

59
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,388
You call this a soccer riot?

60
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:50,305
-Come on, boys. Let's take 'em to school!
-Oi! Oi! Oi!

61
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,900
(clamoring)

62
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,407
Homer, we've got to get out of here!

63
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,331
Oh! But I wanna do some rioting.

64
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,460
-(grunts) Jobbers cobknots, ya mucker!
-All done.

65
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,498
Aah!

66
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,762
(siren wailing)

67
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,968
What began as a traditional soccer riot...

68
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,299
has escalated into a citywide
orgy of destruction.

69
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,756
Reacting swiftly, Mayor Quimby
has declared mob rule.

70
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:28,517
So for the next several years,
it's every family for itself!

71
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,401
Ex-Ex-Excuse me, sir.

72
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,478
I think you've got my TV. Sir?

73
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,694
{\an8}Somebody's gotta stop them!

74
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,565
{\an8}Let's wait until
they burn the school down.

75
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,902
Oh, my God!
Homer, they're right next door.

76
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,278
Relax, Marge.

77
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,534
If someone tries to get in here,

78
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,905
my burglar alarm will let us know.

79
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,036
(rattling)

80
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,080
-(gasps)
-Watch the fish, Marge.

81
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,713
(groans)

82
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,470
Looks like you called me just in time.

83
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,601
-This home isn't secure at all.
-What did I tell you, Marge?

84
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,469
Intruders could come in down the chimney,
through the mail slot...

85
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,977
even hidden in your groceries.

86
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,314
Did you change the locks
when you moved in? I thought not.

87
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,567
{\an8}All the previous owners of this house
could still be in here somewhere.

88
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,400
What do you recommend?

89
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,945
Well, a lot of companies would
put in a pretty system that looks good...

90
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,991
but doesn't provide any real protection.

91
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,244
Oh, let's get that!

92
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,786
But if you really wanna sleep
easy at night,

93
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,119
I recommend sealing off every door
and window with bulletproof Lucite.

94
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,115
Wouldn't we all suffocate?

95
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:36,537
-Well, I should hope not.
-Let's get that, the suffocation thing.

96
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,877
And you can have it all for just $500.

97
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:42,303
$500? Aw, forget it.

98
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,719
But surely you can't put
a price on your family's lives.

99
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,474
I wouldn't have thought so
either, but here we are.

100
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:54,266
Homer, we need something
to protect this family.

101
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,614
I couldn't agree more, Marjorie.

102
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,188
You deserve peace of mind...

103
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:00,573
and peace of mind is what you shall have.

104
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,571
{\an8}I'd like to buy
your deadliest gun, please.

105
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,113
Aisle 6, next to the sympathy cards.

106
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,243
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

107
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,077
-Mmm!
-Whoa!

108
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,792
{\an8}-Careful there, Annie Oakley.
-I don't have to be careful. I got a gun.

109
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,964
Well, you'll probably want
the accessory kit.

110
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,213
-Holster.
-Oh, yeah.

111
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,214
-Bandolier.
-Baby.

112
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,876
-Silencer.
-Mm-hmm.

113
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,264
-Loudener.
-Oh!

114
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,511
-Speed-cocker.
-Ooh! I like the sound of that.

115
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,393
And this is for shooting down
police helicopters.

116
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,471
{\an8}Oh, I don't need
anything like that... yet.

117
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,691
-Just give me my gun.
-Sorry. The law requires

118
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,439
a five-day waiting period.

119
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,481
We've got to run a background check.

120
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,114
{\an8}Five days? But I'm mad now!

121
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,864
-(grunts)
-I'd kill you if I had my gun!

122
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,485
Yeah, well, you don't.

123
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,985
Lousy big shot. Thinks he's so big 'cause
he's got a lot of guns.

124
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,366
If he didn't have any guns,
I'd show him a thing or two.

125
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,464
What happens when he walks into my store?

126
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,630
Then we'll see who's worried
about five-day waiting periods.

127
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,169
Dad, it's 3:00 a.m.!

128
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,424
Can't you mutter in your room?

129
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,256
-Marge kicked me out.
-(groans)

130
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,012
All right. Go ahead.

131
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,095
Pushy kids think they can tell
me what to do in my house.

132
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:16,601
I tell you, parents these days,
they don't know how to rear children.

133
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,820
Oh! How am I supposed to last five days
without shooting something?

Now, I believe you have
some sort of firearm for me.

146
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,913
Well, let's see here.

147
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,369
According to your background check,
you've been in a mental institution.

148
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,081
{\an8}-Yeah.
-Frequent problems with alcohol.

149
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,292
{\an8}-(chuckling) Yeah.
-You beat up President Bush.

150
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,043
<i>Former </i>president.

151
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,047
-"Potentially dangerous"?
-Relax.

152
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,339
That just limits you to three
handguns or less.

153
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,303
Whoo-hoo!

154
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,506
Close your eyes, Marge.

155
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:34,933
-I've got a surprise for you.
-Mmm!

156
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,774
OK, open your eyes.

157
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,770
-(screams)
-It's a handgun. Isn't it great?

158
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,864
This is the trigger,

159
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,019
and this is the thing you point
at whatever you want to die.

160
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:48,947
Homer, I don't want guns in my house!

161
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,158
{\an8}Don't you remember
when Maggie shot Mr. Burns?

162
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,409
{\an8}I thought Smithers did it.

163
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,410
That would have made a lot more sense.

164
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,662
Hey, Dad, can I borrow the gun tomorrow?

165
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,043
I wanna scare that old
security guard at the bank.

166
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,210
-Only if you clean your room.
-(groans)

167
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,129
-No! No one's using this gun.
-(whimpering)

168
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,089
The TV said you're 58% more likely

169
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,380
to shoot a family member
than an intruder.

170
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,878
TV said that?

171
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,797
But I have to have a gun.
It's in the Constitution.

172
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,096
{\an8}Dad, the Second Amendment
is just a remnant from revolutionary days.

173
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,061
{\an8}It has no meaning today.

174
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,601
You couldn't be more wrong, Lisa.

175
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,226
If I didn't have this gun,
the King of England...

176
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:28,193
could just walk in here anytime
he wants and start shoving you around.

177
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,026
Do you want that? Huh?

178
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,281
-Do you?
-No.

179
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:36,033
-All right, then.
-I'm sorry, Homer. No weapons.

180
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,117
A gun is not a weapon, Marge!

181
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:42,163
{\an8}It's a tool, like a butcher knife
or a harpoon...

182
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,168
{\an8}or, uh, an alligator.

183
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,091
{\an8}You just need more
education on the subject.

184
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,260
Tell you what. You come with me to
an N.R.A. meeting,

185
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,970
and if you still don't think
guns are great, we'll argue some more.

186
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:05,557
(beeping)

187
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,606
(beeping stops)

188
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,315
(beeps)

189
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,492
Assault weapons have gotten
a lot of bad press lately...

190
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,412
but they're manufactured for a reason--

191
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,290
to take out today's
modern super animals...

192
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:23,328
such as the flying squirrel
and the electric eel.

193
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,334
-Learning something, Marge?
-(groans)

194
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,383
Uh, hi. I'm Moe S.

195
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,962
Hi, Moe!

196
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,257
Yeah, so last night,
I was closing up the bar

197
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,221
when some young punk comes in
and tries to stick me up.

198
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,012
{\an8}-(all gasping)
-Whatever did you do, Moe?

199
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,306
Well, it could've been
a real ugly situation...

200
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,690
but I managed to shoot him in the spine.

201
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,229
(applause)

202
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:51,153
Yeah, I guess the next place
he robs better have a ramp.

203
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,403
(laughter)

204
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,237
Hi. I'm Homer S.

205
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,572
-ALL: Hi, Homer!
-Hi.

206
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,578
It seems to me if a gun can
protect something as important as a bar...

207
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,582
it's good enough to protect my family.

208
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,325
So if you'll have me,
I would like to become...

209
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:12,087
a lifetime member
of your wonderful organization.

210
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,921
(cheering, shouting)

211
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,387
{\an8}Homer, you can't join up
with these gun nuts.

212
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,429
Oh, come on. Be fair, Marge.

213
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,853
For once in your life, be fair!

214
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,522
(groans)

215
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,399
(explosion)

216
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,656
-Sorry!
-My fault.

217
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,916
(whistling)

218
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,457
(gasps) Don't shoot. Just take the money
and get out.

219
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,415
What? Oh, Apu, I would never--

220
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,296
{\an8}Or would I?

221
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,303
(thinking) <i>I've already gone this far.</i>

222
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:03,715
<i>I wonder what my life would be like if</i>
<i>I robbed the Kwik-E-Mart.</i>

223
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,397
{\an8}I'll do it. I'll rob the Kwik-E-Mart.

224
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,454
{\an8}All right, put your-- D'oh!

225
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,858
Oh, well, I'll rob it next time.

226
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,581
Can you help me get my ball
down from the roof, Dad?

227
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,502
Sure thing, honey.

228
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,458
-You want me to get the cat down?
-No, thanks.

229
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,547
HOMER: Pull!

230
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,175
Missed one, Dad.

231
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,769
{\an8}-See you in Hell, dinner plate.
-(gunshot)

232
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,105
Does anyone know where
all my dinner plates went?

233
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,823
{\an8}-Um-
-You probably left 'em at work.

234
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,204
On another topic,

235
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,910
guess who was picked to host
the next N.R.A. get-together?

236
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,405
Homer, I told you this morning,
no guns at the dinner table.

237
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,037
You said the breakfast table.

238
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,333
It's the same table!

239
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,797
Listen, if it'll make you feel any better,

240
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,128
I'll put the safety on.

241
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,884
Whoops! Guess it was already on.

242
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,890
Uh, I'd better just put it down.

243
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,691
No offense, Mom, but that was pretty cool.

244
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:40,492
Homer, I think you'd agree that
I've put up with a lot in this marriage.

245
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,833
But this is the first time
since we've been married

246
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:52,121
that I've actually feared for our lives.

247
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:57,546
So I'm asking you, if you really care
about me and the children...

248
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,708
please, please get rid of the gun.

249
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:11,346
All right, Marge. I'll do it for you.

250
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,693
(moaning)

251
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,689
I'm a lucky woman.

252
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,571
And I'm a wonderful man.

253
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,739
(straining) Aw! I don't feel them.

254
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,740
You said there'd be "Fudgeicles," Bart.
Where's the "Fudgeicles"?

255
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,244
First, it's Fudgsicle.

256
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:32,116
And I know they're up here.
I just need a better foothold.

257
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,752
Hello!

258
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,883
And the next marksman is
William Tell, Jr.!

259
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,012
{\an8}Jinx!

260
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,508
(gasps) Bart!

261
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,644
Oh, I see Bart gets to have a gun.

262
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,640
You lied to me!

263
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,392
You promised to get rid of this gun.

264
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,524
I put it in a safe place, Marge.

265
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:58,522
I mean, what are the odds the boy
would look in the vegetable crisper?

266
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,766
How could you?

267
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,988
Of all the terrible things
you've ever done in your life,

268
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,859
this is the worst--

269
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,156
the most despicable!

270
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,830
But, Marge, I swear to you,
I never thought you'd find out!

271
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,201
(groans)

272
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,787
Until you decide what's more important,

273
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,133
your gun or your family,

274
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,998
we can't live in the same house.

275
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,245
Come on, kids.

276
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:26,223
So this is the thanks I get
for protecting my family?

277
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,219
Then go! I'll be just fine!

278
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,602
{\an8}-Do you know how to cook dinner?
-Do I?

279
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,531
-I've left Homer.
-Thank God.

280
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,704
So we need a place to spend the night.

281
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,996
{\an8}Try the Sleep-Eazy Motel.
I woke up there once. Seemed nice.

282
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,330
Why can't we stay here?

283
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,754
Uh, we have a gentleman caller.

284
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:04,304
Hey, this TV's not broken.
It's just unplugged. What the-

285
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,891
Ooh, the gun club's gonna be
here any minute.

286
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,839
(doorbell rings)

287
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,968
(gasps) They're here! They're here!

288
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:18,563
Hiya, Homer. I brung ya a big bag of
irregular Oreos.

289
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,321
I don't see what's wrong
with this one. Oh.

290
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,660
Looking for a good time, sailor?

291
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,537
{\an8}-I certainly am.
-No, you're not!

292
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,415
He's really not.

293
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,712
And that's how,
with a few minor adjustments,

294
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,756
you can turn a regular gun into five guns.

295
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,761
(light applause)

296
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,642
Here's some more
chocolate curls, gun buddies.

297
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,443
Anyone else want a beer?

298
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,570
(all gasp) Homer, you use your gun
as a can opener?

299
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,148
I use it for everything.

300
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,693
Watch me turn on the TV.

301
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,607
-(gunfire)
-(grunting)

302
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,237
I've never seen such recklessness!

303
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:21,082
-You might've hurt someone!
-Are you some kind of moron?

304
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,625
-Yeah, but-
-Hey, <i>yutz. </i>Guns aren't toys.

305
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,300
They're for family protection,
hunting dangerous or delicious animals...

306
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,300
and keeping the king of England
out of your face.

307
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:36,559
-Your membership card please, Homer.
-Oh!

308
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,138
I'll also need to remove your tattoo.

309
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,144
-I didn't get one yet.
-Rats.

310
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,686
Now, since you're no longer a member,

311
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,811
please go outside
until the meeting is over.

312
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,778
(chuckling)

313
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,237
-(disco music playing)
-(laughing, chattering)

314
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,870
-Hey, we got a pool!
-Can we go swimming, Mom?

315
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,788
{\an8}Mmm, not right now, dear.

316
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,252
Wow! The TV's coin-operated.

317
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,831
{\an8}And so is the Bible!

318
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,923
I'd like to order a wake-up call, please.

319
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,665
3:00 a.m. Uh, for every room
except this one.

320
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,547
That's right. Good night.

321
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,434
(chuckling) Always love
trying out new material on the road.

322
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,103
BART: No way are you gonna
beat me this time, Lise.

323
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,732
-(coins clinking)
-(voice wavering) Yes, I am!

324
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,980
-Come on, Spotty!
-Come on, Smelly!

325
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,574
(gunfire)

326
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,792
Oh! This gun cost me everything,

327
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,501
my wife, my kids.

328
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:48,091
Everything but my precious, precious gun.

329
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,132
(gunshot)

330
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,593
This stinks. I want my family back.

331
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,097
Hey, is that a camera in the ceiling?

332
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,758
(male voice) <i>No. Go back to sleep.</i>

333
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:03,227
This bed is making me nauseous!

334
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,478
Why won't it stop?

335
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,901
Honey, it'll be morning soon.
Try to get some sleep.

336
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,231
-(door opens)
-(gasps)

337
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,896
Oh, uh, I'm sorry. Are you planning to
stay the whole night?

338
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,777
-Yes!
-All right.

339
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,238
Vote Quimby.

340
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,001
-Marge?
-(man groans)

341
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,960
-Sorry. Marge?
-(woman gasps)

342
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,750
-Oh. Sorry. Marge?
-MAYOR QUIMBY: Vote Quimby.

343
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,995
-Sorry.
-MARGE: Down here, Homer!

344
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:35,967
Oh, Marge, there's so many
things I wanna yell to you!

345
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,839
Come down here!

346
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,846
OK!

347
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:43,138
Oh, honey, please come home. I need you.

348
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,563
It's dark in the house
and I'm hungry and lonesome...

349
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,692
and there's no one there
to hear my various witty remarks.

350
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,770
-What about the gun?
-It's gone for good, Marge.

351
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,527
{\an8}I finally realized, what's the point
of having a gun for protection,

352
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,861
{\an8}if you've got no one to protect?

353
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,066
Oh, Homie.

354
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,076
Mmm!

355
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,246
Come on, kids. We're going home.

356
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,329
BOTH: Yea!

357
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,035
Okeydoke. Here's your bill

358
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,956
and your continental breakfast.

359
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,667
(coughing)

360
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,469
All right, everybody, hands up!

361
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,814
You, give me the cash drawer.

362
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,390
Do what he says. I'm too rich to die.

363
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,309
Freeze, bad guy!

364
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:35,939
-Vote Quimby!
-OK, man. Don't shoot. Chill.

365
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:41,196
Homer, you said you got rid of
the gun! You lied to me again!

366
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,531
I know I said that,

367
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,616
-but what I secretly meant was--
-Yoink!

368
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,791
(sinister laughter)

369
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,250
The joke's on you, buddy.

370
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,870
There's no bullets in that thing.

371
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,207
-(rattling)
-(laughing)

372
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,252
Yo, give me the bullets.

373
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,506
-OK. don't shoot!
-ALL: Drop it!

374
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,340
Bye!

375
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,347
How did you know we were being robbed?

376
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,429
The clerk here pressed
the silent alarm,

377
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,175
and we picked it up on our scanner.

378
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,267
-Did anyone stop that robber?
-No, I don't think so.

379
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,731
I'm sorry I lied to you, Marge...

380
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,067
but this gun had a hold on me.

381
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,612
I felt this incredible surge of power,

382
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,197
like God must feel
when he's holding a gun.

383
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,243
So please, get rid of it,

384
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,786
because I know I'll just lie
to you again and again.

385
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,552
Hmm!

386
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,696
(theme music playing)

387
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,185
Shh!

388
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,196
