Do I smell cupcakes?

Lisa's making these
for her teacher.

Say no more.

- Yum! Don't mind if I do.
- Bart!

7
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,663
- Man!
- Keep your greasy mitts outta there.

8
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:36,041
- These are for Lisa's class.
- It's Mrs. Hoover's birthday.

- You know, there are names you.
- No, there aren't.

You're saying "butt kisser" like it's bad.

12
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:51,889
Well, you see, boy, it never hurts
to grease the wheels a little.

13
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,798
I'm not greasing the wheels, Dad.
I like my teacher.

14
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,138
Sure, Lis.
You see how it works, Bart?

15
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,433
A cupcake here,
a good grade there.

16
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,727
Dad, I get good grades
'cause I'm smart

17
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,521
and I pay attention
and I study hard.

18
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:07,145
Yeah, right, Lisa.
It's the three roads to success, Bart:

19
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,453
work, brains and -

20
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,278
Brother.

21
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,033
School bus. Gotta go.

Heh-heh-heh.
Doh!

00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:22,171
- Yo, Ottoman!
- Yo, Bartdude!

24
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,208
Hey, can you believe it, man?

25
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:27,052
My sister here made a whole pile of
cupcakes to butter up her teacher,

26
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,007
and she won't give anybody else
even one measly little crumb.

27
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,010
That's bad news, man.

28
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,682
Here, Otto.
I made an extra one for you.

29
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,561
- Thanks, little lady.
- You're welcome.

30
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,349
Whoa!

31
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,733
- Better let me hold these, Lis.
- Forget it.

32
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,731
- You sniveling toad! You little egg sucker!
- Tell me more.

33
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,154
Back-Scratcher.
Foot-Licker. Honor student!

34
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,943
You'll never get one now,
Mr. Name-Caller.

35
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:54,777
All right, all right. Look, I'm sorry.
I-I got upset.

36
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:55,994
In the heat of the moment,

37
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,834
I said some things
I didn't mean.

38
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,199
- You weren't thinking, were you?
- No.

39
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,116
- I'm not a sniveling toad, am I?
- Not really.

40
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,246
I'm not a little
egg sucker, am I?

41
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,503
- Of course not.
- Then what am I?

42
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,995
A beautiful human being.

43
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,878
What do you like best about me?

44
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,715
Well, I'd have to say...

45
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,511
your generous nature,
your spirit of giving.

46
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,005
Well...

47
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,656
Open your mouth
and close your eyes,

48
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,854
and you will get a big surprise.

49
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,437
Thanks, Lis.
You're the best.

50
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,065
- Look, Janey. Cupcakes.
- Give me that!

51
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,578
Hey, give those back!

52
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,080
Hey, what's the big idea?
That's my sister, man.

53
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,413
So what?

54
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,997
So give her back those cupcakes

55
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,672
before I knock your block off.

56
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,250
Don't, Bart!
He's a friend of Nelson Muntz!

57
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,598
Ooh!

58
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,597
Wha...

59
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,685
Nelson, you're bleeding.

60
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,440
Nah, happens all the time.

splatters on me.

00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,525
Hey, wait a minute.

63
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,951
You're right.

64
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,159
You made me bleed my own blood!

65
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,281
It was an accident, man.

66
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,407
A terrible, ghastly mistake.
Ask anybody.

67
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,708
A cold wind.

68
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,502
Hello, kids.
Everything above the board here?

69
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,507
Good.
Play friendly, children.

70
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,929
There's your bell.

71
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,838
Come along, now, all of you.
No dawdling, now.

72
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,718
I'll get you after school, man.

73
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,314
But...

74
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,309
No, no, no.
He'll get you after school, son.

75
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,711
Now hurry up.
It's time for class.

76
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,138
But...

77
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,228
Scoot, young Simpson.
There's learning afoot.

78
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,120
Okay, Nelson, put up your dukes!

79
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,371
Whaa!

80
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,921
Yikes!

81
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,498
Ha, ha, ha!

82
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,844
Ha, ha, ha!

83
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:26,851
Aah!

84
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,766
- Stop!
- Lunchtime!

85
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,694
Ha, ha, ha!

86
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,364
- Lunchtime!
- Aah!

87
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,953
Lunchtime, Bart.
It's lunchtime.

88
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,870
I ain't gonna get out
of the fourth grade alive.

89
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,950
You've gotta tell
Principal Skinner, Bart.

90
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,956
I can't squeal.

91
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,458
It would violate the
code of the schoolyard.

92
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,541
Hey, everybody!

93
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,626
Here comes my brother,
Bart the bully-killer!

94
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,473
You're our hero, Bart!

95
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,589
Look, everybody.

96
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,755
I would just as soon not
make a big deal out of this.

97
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,722
I'm not sayin' I'm not a hero.

98
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,474
I'm just saying that
I fear for my safety.

99
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,191
Look out!

100
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,322
Nelson, it was all a mistake.

101
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,279
This is how it happened, man.

102
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,569
Listen up. You may get
a kick out of it.

103
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,783
My sister was making cupcakes this morning
and...

104
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,624
I'll see you
at the flagpole at 3:15.

105
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,620
And you better be prompt.

106
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,622
He has four other beatings
scheduled this afternoon.

107
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,924
Good-bye, little dude.

108
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,506
- He looks so lifelike, man.
- Yes.

109
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,842
The school nurse did
a wonderful job

110
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,217
reconstructing his
little face after the fight.

111
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,505
♪♪

112
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,848
Good-bye, son.
I guess you were right.

113
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,103
All that homework
was a waste of your time.

114
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,806
Thanks, Bart. We got the day off
from school for this.

115
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,147
- Yeah, and I got the day off from work.
- Homer!

116
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,032
Who wants a day off from work

117
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,819
when I'm never gonna see
my beloved son again?

118
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,374
Bart!
Bart!

119
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,369
That's better, Homer.

120
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,951
Be brave.
Bye-bye, Bart.

121
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:16,248
You were always my
special little guy.

122
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,456
Bart, here's that
cupcake you wanted.

123
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,877
I can't help but think if I had just
given it to you in the first place,

124
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:28,387
this whole horrible tragedy
could have been avoided.

125
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,391
I know you can't eat it now,

126
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:34,443
so I'll just place it
lovingly on your forehead.

127
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,519
Hey, look.
They got food at this thing.

128
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,105
Here's one for the road, dude.

129
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,498
- Aah!
- Put 'em up.

130
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,966
Boy, you sure
taught me a lesson.

131
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:09,351
Whoo.
Thanks, guys.

132
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,929
I guess now all that's left
is a hearty handshake.

133
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,675
Right, guys?

134
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:18,807
I'm gonna get you again
tomorrow, Simpson.

135
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,769
Is 3:15 good for you?

136
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,778
Not really.

137
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,780
Too bad.

138
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,912
No.

139
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,905
Man, that guy's tough to love.

140
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,433
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.

141
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,392
- Tough day at school, boy?
- Bart, what happened to you?

142
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,814
Let's just say I paid the inevitable price
for helping out my sister.

143
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,685
So, you had a little
scuffle? Heh-Heh.

144
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:02,942
Hope you won.

145
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,815
I'm gonna miss you, big guy.

146
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,696
Bart, your mother
has the fool idea...

147
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,995
that you're upset
about something.

148
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,210
Dad, I need help.
Please.

149
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,503
Now come on, Bart.

150
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,837
We don't want your mother
to see you crying.

151
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,843
- Here.
- Man.

152
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,715
Let me help you dry those tears.

153
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,273
So what's the problem, son?

154
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,849
- I had a run-in with a bully.
- A bully?

155
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,686
Come on, Marge! I don't bug you
when you're helping Lisa.

156
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:46,112
Well, Bart, I hope you're going straight
to the principal about this.

157
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,112
I guess I could do that.

158
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:52,374
What? And violate the code
of the schoolyard? I'd rather Bart died.

159
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,528
What on Earth are you
talking about, Homer?

160
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,697
The code of the
schoolyard, Marge.

161
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,456
The rules that teach
a boy to be a man. Let's see.

162
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,419
Don't tattle. Always make fun
of those different from you.

163
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,841
Never say anything

164
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,510
unless you're sure everyone feels
exactly the same way you do.

165
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,879
- What else?
- Homer, that's ridiculous.

166
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,047
Bart, instead of fighting,

167
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,056
why don't you try
a little understanding?

168
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,268
- What do you mean, Mom?
- Yeah, right.

169
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,849
- This oughta be good for a laugh.
- Shh!

170
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,935
This bully friend of yours,
is he a little on the chunky side?

171
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,771
Yeah, he's pretty chunkified, all right.

172
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,397
And I'll bet he doesn't do well
in his studies, either.

173
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,815
No, he's pretty dumb.

174
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,513
He's in all the same
special classes I am.

175
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,990
- That's why he lashes out at the world.
- Marge.

176
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,325
So tomorrow, instead of
bickering with this boy, talk to him.

177
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,962
You'll be surprised how far
a little understanding will go.

178
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,129
Well, thank you very much,
Mrs. Maharishi Gandhi.

179
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,629
Let's go, boy.

180
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:51,302
Now here's that bully of yours.
Show me your stuff.

181
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,635
No, no! Not like that!
Like this!

182
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,975
See that, boy?

183
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,444
You didn't expect that, did you?

184
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,654
And neither will he.

185
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,994
You mean I should
fight dirty, Dad?

186
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,489
Unfortunately, son, we Simpsons

187
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,212
sometimes have to bend the rules
a little in order to hold our own.

188
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,781
Amen.

189
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,288
So the next time this bully

190
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,679
thinks you're gonna throw a punch,

191
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,834
you throw a glob
of mud in his eyes!

192
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,934
And then you sock him
when he's staggerin' around blinded!

193
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,918
- Yeah!
- And there's nothing wrong...

194
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,342
with hitting someone
when his back is turned.

195
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,551
- Gotcha.
- And if you get the chance,

196
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,882
get him right
in the family jewels.

197
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,467
That little doozy's been
a Simpson trademark for generations.

198
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,269
Thanks, Pop.

199
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,771
- Whoa!
- Put 'em up!

200
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,773
Ha!
Ooh!

201
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,614
Remember the family jewels, son.

202
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,542
No, boys.
Not the can, please.

203
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,541
Doh!

204
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,842
Bart, you can't go on like this.

205
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,883
I know.

206
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,046
- Why don't you go see grandpa?
- What can he do?

207
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,175
He'll give you good advice.
He's the toughest Simpson alive.

208
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,183
- He is?
- Yeah.

209
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,505
Remember the fight he put up
when we put him in the home?

210
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,648
I'm here to see Grandpa.

211
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,193
Half the people here
are named Grandpa.

212
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,605
Well, Grandpa Simpson then.

213
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,406
Second floor, third
dank room on the left.

214
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,200
Thanks, lady.

215
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,583
"Dear advertisers,

216
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:48,711
"I am disgusted with the way
old people are depicted on television.

217
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,801

218
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,468
"Many of us are bitter,
resentful individuals

219
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,969
"who remember the good old days

220
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,761
"when entertainment
was bland and inoffensive.

221
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,517
"The following

222
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,939
"I never want to hear

223
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,859

224
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,439
"Number two: Horny.

225

Number three:
Family Jewels."

226
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,954
- Hi, Grandpa!
- Bart, what brings you here?

227
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,200
I need some advice, Grandpa.

228
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,663
See, there's this bully
at school who keeps beating me up.

229
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,575
Let me tell you somethin', boy.

230
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,583
If you don't
stand up for yourself,

231
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:32,245
bullies are gonna be pickin' on you
for the rest of your life.

232
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,044
Simpson, give me your newspaper!

233
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,008
- Why should I?
- I wanna do the crossword puzzle.

234
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,049
No, I want to do
the crossword puzzle!

235
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,303
- I said, give me that puzzle.
- No.

236
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,505
- Give me!
- No!

237
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,715
- Give me!
- No!

238
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,443
Heh-heh-heh.

239
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,860
Well, I guess I can't help you,
but I know someone who can.

240
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,739
- Here?
- Yep, this is it.

241
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,741
What's the password?

242
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:06,203
- Let me in, you idiot!
- Yeah, right you are.

243
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,495
So, Herman, has the
large-type edition...

244
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,120
of this month's "Soldier of Fortune"
come in yet?

245
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,128
No, not yet.

246
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,130
Can I interest you in some authentic Nazi
underpants?

247
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,673
No!
Actually, we came over

248
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,837
because I want you to
meet my grandson, Bart.

249
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,006
Hello, young American.

250
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:27,014
Hello, sir.
Mr. Herman?

251
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,017
Yes?

252
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,439
Did you lose your arm
in the war?

253
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,359
My arm? Well,
let me put it this way.

254
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,108
Next time your teacher tells you

255
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,940
to keep your arm inside
the bus window, you do it!

256
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,566
Yes, sir, I will.

257
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,033
Bart's got a problem

258
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,782
with a local young bully
named Nelson.

259
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,784
I thought you could help him
with some kind of strategy.

260
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:50,197
Strategy.
How many men do you have?

261
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,207
- None.
- You'll need more.

262
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:56,039
And you'll need to train them hard!
Now, let's see.

263
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,126
Okay.

264
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,722
The key to Springfield
has always been Elm Street.

265
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,879
The Greeks knew it.
The Carthaginians knew it.

266
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,968
Now you know it.

267
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,433
First you'll need
a declaration of war.

268
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,345
That way, everything you do
will be nice and legal.

269
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,855
Okay, I can use this one
from the Franco-Prussian war.

270
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:21,319
I'll just change "Otto von Bismarck"
to read "Bart Simpson."

271
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,702
Psst!

272
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:27,579
- Grandpa, I think this guy's a little nuts.
- Yeah?

273
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,908
Well, General George S. Patton
was a little nuts.

274
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,995
And this guy is completely
out of his mind.

275
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,831

So, mister, what are
we doin' here anyway?

279
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,687
I wonder where Bart is.

280
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,732
Yeah. It's way past
1500 hours.

281
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,815
Okay, we all know
why we're here, right?

282
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,788
- No. Why?
- To fight Nelson the bully.

283
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:15,959
That guy has been tormenting all of us
for years, and I for one am sick of it.

Nelson's at the Elm Street
video arcade.

332
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,108
Intelligence indicates he shakes down
kids for quarters at the arcade.

333
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,440
Then he heads to the Quick-E-Mart
for a cherry squishy.

334
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,435
Then that's where we'll hit him.

335
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,607
When he leaves the Quick-E-Mart,
we start the saturation bombing.

336
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,277
- We got the water balloons?
- Two hundred rounds, sir.

337
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,446
Is it okay if they say
"Happy Birthday" on the side?

338
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,745
Well, I'd rather they say
"Death From Above,"

339
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,039
but I guess we're stuck.

340
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,673
Okay, our main force will
be split into two groups.

341
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,922
One will circle around this way
to cut off the enemy's retreat,

342
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:14,295
the other will drive in this way,
closing the trap.

343
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,184
It's a classic pincers movement.

344
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,391
- It can't fail against a ten-year-old.
- Heh-heh!

345
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,972
- Nelson's at the arcade, General.
- Battle stations.

346
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,478
- I feel so alive!
- You know,

347
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,480
I thought I was too old.

348
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,982
I thought my time had passed.

349
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,605
I thought I'd never hear
the screams of pain

350
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,703
or see the look of terror
in a young man's eyes.

351
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,700
Thank heaven for children.

352
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,702
Hey, good squishies.

353
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,704
- What flavor did you get?
- Blue.

354
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,656
Hey, you two birds!

355
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:43,926
You're gonna be suckin' all
your meals through straws

356
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,246
if you don't shut your traps.

357
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:51,587
Well, looky here.
Little Bart Simpson.

358
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,222
Nelson, I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to teach you a lesson.

359
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,509
Ha! Yeah?
You and what army?

360
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,683
This one.

361
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,102
Artillery,

362
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,431
commence saturation bombing!

363
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,119
Hey!

364
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,706
All right, you kids!
Keep it down!

365
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,712
Am I making myself...

366
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,214
Heh-heh-heh!
Got him!

367
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,257
You, up in the tree.
The tall gray-haired kid.

368
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,221
Get your butt down here
right now! Doh!

369
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,057
No! Please!

370
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,230
- Don't hurt us!
- We surrender.

371
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,689
W-W-We were only
followin' orders!

372
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,162
Eww!
Knock it off!

373
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,212
I guess you learned
your lesson, so now I'll untie you.

374
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,368
The second you untie me,

375
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,707
I'm gonna beat you
to death, man.

376
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,712
Well, if that's gonna
be your attitude,

377
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,384
I'm not gonna untie you.

378
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,883
Ha! You're gonna
have to sometime.

379
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,262
He's right.

380
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,684
Don't you worry.

381
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,562
I was ready for this
little eventuality.

382
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,772
Armistice treaty, article four.

383
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:33,402
"Nelson is never again to raise
his fists in anger." Article five.

384
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:37,032
"Nelson recognizes Bart's right
to exist." Article six.

385
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,240
"Although Nelson shall have
no official power,

386
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,032
he shall remain a figurehead
of menace in the neighborhood."

387
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,616
Wow. Sounds good to me.
Okay, I'll sign.

388
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,752
What about you, boy?

389
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,288
All right, I'll sign.

390
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,872
Are you boys
through playing war?

391
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,787
- Yeah.
- Yes, Mrs. Simpson.

392
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,125
- Good. Then here's some cupcakes.
- Boy!

393
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,512
Cupcakes.

394
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,845
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

395
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,849
contrary to what
you've just seen,

396
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,431
war is neither
glamorous nor fun.

397
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,267
There are no winners.
Only losers.

398
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,693
There are no good wars,
with the following exceptions:

399
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,783
The American Revolution, World War II,
and the "Star Wars" trilogy.

400
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,439
If you'd like
to learn more about war,

401
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,738
there's lots of books
in your local library...

402
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,742
Many of them with
cool, gory pictures.

403
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,584
Well, good night, everybody.
Peace, man.
