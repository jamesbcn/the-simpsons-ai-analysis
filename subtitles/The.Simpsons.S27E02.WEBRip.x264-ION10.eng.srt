{\an8}and I'm challenging you to an Eat-down!

177
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,571
{\an8}What's that--
some kind of eat-down?

178
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,279
{\an8}It's my new show where I use

179
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,279
{\an8}my big-time New York City chef skills

180
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,661
{\an8}to obliterate amateur cooks.

181
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,739
{\an8}Who would watch such a one-sided farce?

182
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,985
{\an8}I'm in.

183
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,656
{\an8}This Eat-down's gonna throw down

184
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,785
{\an8}at the Springfield Barbecue Festival.

185
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:21,422
{\an8}And when I'm done, you're gonna
wish you never heard of food!

186
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,751
-(people oohing)
-Buy my cookware!

187
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,666
(gasps)
I'm competing against Scotty Boom!

188
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,336
He's got what all great chefs have--

189
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,835
yelling.

190
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,847
ALL:
(chanting) Homer! Homer! Homer!

191
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,271
You were right, greasy hobo.

192
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,600
Nothing fixes bad times like good food.

193
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,096
<i>Up here, I can watch</i>

194
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:46,028
<i>anyone in the world take a shower.</i>

195
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,527
(grunting)

196
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,201
Okay, pork, I'm gonna throw you

197
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,109
in that magic smoker for 24 hours

198
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,948
and win that cook-off.

199
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,743
I only wish you could be alive to see it.

200
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,197
(British accent)
Then I suppose

201
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,247
this is my last chance to say

202
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,671
I love you.

203
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,169
Aw...

204
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,841
(gasps)

205
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,589
Oh, no!

206
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,382
Our smoker's been stolen!

207
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,875
Why?!

208
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,177
And when?!

209
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,641
<i>You didn't lock it up?</i>

210
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,391
<i>You fat idiot!</i>

211
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,853
<i>I'm out of here.</i>

212
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,854
(groans)

213
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,734
(moans)
You'll find the Hive, right?

214
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,777
Tell me you'll find my smoker!

215
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,030
Ah, don't you worry.

216
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,242
The Springfield PD is on the case.

217
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,992
Ah, yeah.

218
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,834
Uh, well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.

219
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,499
High-end barbeques like yours
are easy pickings.

220
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,999
Smokeheads grab them at night,
clean them up.

221
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,331
Next thing you know,
it's cooking another family's hot dogs.

222
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,338
Humanity-- what a joke.

223
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,590
(spits)

224
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:49,761
So, it's gone.

225
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,669
It's really gone.

226
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,047
All that's left
is the smell of burning hickory

227
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,675
and four tiny little wheel prints.

228
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,352
Good night, sweet prints.

229
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,360
So you lost your grill.

230
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,275
Snap out of it, you big fat baby.

231
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,373
Son, this is so much more

232
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,449
than just losing
an outdoor cooking device.

233
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,494
How to explain this to a child?

234
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,868
This is the death of hope.

235
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,115
What are you talking about?

236
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,037
Everything good
that comes into our lives,

237
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,046
the universe takes away.

238
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,548
So from now on,
I'm just gonna lie here

239
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,511
and never care again.

240
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,721
Come on, you know your life sucks.

241
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,221
Just get drunk like you always do.

242
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,683
I don't want to.

243
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,933
(gasps)

244
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,562
(moans)

245
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,892
Look at him.

246
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,896
He's lying there like a beached whale
waiting to explode.

247
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,109
Maybe we should try
to track down that smoker.

248
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,360
I don't know.

249
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,741
The whole barbequing scene
is pretty pro-meat.

250
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,278
And all that smoke
pollutes the environment.

251
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,573
This isn't about your boyfriend,
the planet.

252
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,987
I've never seen him this beaten down.

253
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,202
Okay, look for clues.

254
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,037
Are there any mud samples we can trace

255
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,382
to local heaths and moors?

256
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,588
Sorry. I've been watching
a lot of <i>Sherlock.</i>

257
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,049
(barking)

258
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,248
Knock it off, boy.

259
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,588
I don't have any meat for you.

260
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,343
-Get down!
-Wait!

261
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,264
Santa's Little Helper
was in the yard last night

262
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,433
when the smoker was stolen,
but he didn't make a peep.

263
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,563
Why?

264
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,812
(gasps)

265
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,562
Natural peanut butter?

266
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,273
What if someone gave this to the dog

267
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,015
so he'd be licking instead of barking

268
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,527
while they took the smoker?!

269
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,608
(gasps)
You got a clue, boy!

270
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,494
A clue! (laughs)

271
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,780
Who's a smart dog?

272
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,033
Who's a smart dog?

273
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,656
(panting)

274
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,333
(barking)

275
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,912
(panting)

276
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,116
{\an8}<i>-(bell clangs)</i>
<i>-ANNOUNCER: You're watching</i>

00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,246
{\an8}Eat-down <i>with Scotty Boom.</i>

00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,713
Come on, Homie.

279
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:54,053
We can't let this Empire State jabroni
beat us.

280
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,220
{\an8}This week I took on the Gilbert family
of Portland, Maine.

281
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,549
{\an8}They've been making clam chowder
for generations.

282
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,555
{\an8}How is that better than something
I spent a day on?

283
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,218
{\an8}I win!

284
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,426
{\an8}Manhattan chowder, baby!

285
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,347
{\an8}NYC!

286
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,556
{\an8}Greatest city, greatest chowder!

287
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:14,016
{\an8}The Gilbert family
has learned a valuable lesson--

288
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,528
{\an8}screw everything.

289
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,530
Dad, we're gonna find that smoker!

290
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,283
To try is to fail!

291
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,906
There's only one store in town

292
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,253
that sells all-natural peanut butter.

293
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,498
(bell dings)

294
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,880
Don't worry,
I know how to talk to these people.

295
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,384
Thank goodness you have organic fennel.

296
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:43,347
The fennel at the farmer's market
is only transitional.

297
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,009
(groans)
Typical.

298
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,097
Small farmers ruining it
for the really small farmers.

299
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,194
So, could you maybe tell me

300
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,609
who bought this brand of peanut butter?

301
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,228
Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.

302
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,435
You want me to violate
my customers' privacy?

303
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,985
Who are you working for?

304
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,738
The NSA? Big pharma?

305
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,280
Amazon Prime?

306
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,703

309
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,695
My ridiculous flesh hoops!

310
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,579
There!

311
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,205
Someone's ringing up peanut butter.

312
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,382
(both gasp)
Nelson!

313
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,956
What are you playing there,
Nelson?

315
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,551
So what if it is?

316
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,224
Your castle's pretty well-defended.

317
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,262
Level six catapults.

318
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,885
Level seven sorcerers.

319
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,771

00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,939
Uh, yeah, well.

321
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,228
Yeah, gets the job done.

322
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,061
I tell you,
those are some nice upgrades.

323
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,897
Expensive upgrades.

324
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,402
Upgrades like that cost gems.

325
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,445
And gems cost cash.

326
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,489
Expensive cash.

327
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,912
Where'd you get the cash, Nelson?

328
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,450
I don't use gems!

329
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,494
I'm a grinder! A grinder!

337
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,394
What are they?

338
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,432
They're like televisions...

339
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,726
but they just keep going!

340
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,600
He's meeting with someone.

341
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,727
That's always a sign of guilt.

342
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:22,946
Hope you don't mind.

343
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,238
I cooked some dinner on it.

344
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,992
Mmm. (sniffs)

345
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,825
Ah, smell you later.

346
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,790

Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,726
(groans)

357
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,810
(both groan)

358
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,685
The universe does hate us.

359
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,981
It feels good to surrender.

360
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,815
(all groan)

361
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,491
Good girl, Maggie.

362
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,489
Give up young.

363
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,071
(panting, barking)

364
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,157
(all groaning)

365
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,827
Get up off that floor!

366
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,826
We are on a head-to-head cook-off

367
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,418
that'll be shown on TV
and probably some planes.

368
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,424
We don't have the smoker.

369
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,926
Just let us forfeit with dignity.

370
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,799
We still have to try.

371
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,096
This isn't a family of quitters.

372
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,350
Sure we are.

373
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,681
We always have been
and more so now.

374
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,347
I'm a quitter.

375
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,845
And I'll back down to anyone
who says I'm not.

376
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,607
Come on, Buddhists aren't quitters.

377
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:44,359
Actually, Mom, Buddhism is really
just quitting in yoga pants.

378
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,203
This is a Live Strong bracelet.

379
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,279
Lance Armstrong never quit.

380
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,985
He never quit the Tour de France.

381
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,535
He never quit lying about his steroid use.

382
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,959
And he still hasn't totally come clean.

383
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,868
Now get in the car!

384
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,207
{\an8}(lively chatter)

385
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,291
-MOE: Eat-down! Eat-down! Eat-down!
-Yee-haw!

386
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,474
I can handle
this barbeque competition.

387
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:10,138
All I need is a little help
from an old friend.

388
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,429
(whip cracks)

389
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,814
{\an8}I'm Alton Brown,

390
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,979
{\an8}and welcome to <i>Eat-down!</i>

391
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,938
{\an8}Today Scotty Boom
takes on the Simpsons in...

392
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,399
{\an8}-(bell clanging)
-"Barbeque Battle."

393
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,650
{\an8}And I can tell you this--
it will be edited

394
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,112
{\an8}to be dramatic.

395
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,113
{\an8}Marge, do you think your meat

396
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,155
{\an8}has what it takes
to win this Eat-down?

397
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,819
{\an8}It sure does.

398
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,577
{\an8}Homer, what about you?

399
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,949
{\an8}No way in hell.

400
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,445
{\an8}What about you kids?

401
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,117
{\an8}Are you pumped up
to beat Scotty Boom?

402
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,745
{\an8}Happiness is an illusion.

403
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,252
{\an8}What she said.

404
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,254
{\an8}Looks like the Simpsons are playing
mind games with you, Scotty.

405
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,167
{\an8}Are you feeling the pressure?

406
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,416
{\an8}No pressure.

407
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,627
{\an8}I'm throwing down
<i>the</i> taste of New York.

408
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:54,098
{\an8}My recipe's infused with Times Square,
the Bronx Zoo,

409
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,349
{\an8}and the <i>Sex and the City</i> walking tour.

410
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,182
{\an8}The Simpsons better bring their A game.

411
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,347
{\an8}HOMER:
F! F game!

412
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,110
{\an8}I call this
my Never-Give-Up Brisket.

413
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,940
{\an8}The secret ingredient is hope.

414
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,948
{\an8}Mm?

415
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,160
{\an8}(spits)

416
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,369
{\an8}How many spices did you put in this?

417
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,870
{\an8}All of them.

418
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,951
(all groaning)

419
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:23,246
{\an8}(audience oohing)

420
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,253
{\an8}I've never seen
such unusual grill marks.

421
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,166
{\an8}This pattern looks like a honeycomb.

422
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,416
What?

423
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,627
{\an8}That meat was cooked
on the Hive!

424
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,308
{\an8}This garlic-sucking tunnel trash
stole our smoker!

425
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,098
{\an8}Ah, this little flyover's crazy.

426
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,522
{\an8}I cooked that meat myself
right here over here.

427
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,856
{\an8}The grill marks don't match.

428
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,439
{\an8}Dead meat doesn't lie.

429
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,025
{\an8}(audience gasping)

430
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,280
{\an8}(gasping)

431
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:55,031
{\an8}Scotty Boom, you are hereby banned
from the Chew Network.

432
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,655
{\an8}You are no longer a celebrity chef.

433
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,503
{\an8}You're just a chef.

434
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,868
{\an8}Take him away, Chief.

435
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,544
{\an8}Grand theft smoker.

436
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,253
{\an8}Sounds like a crime to me.

437
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,010
{\an8}Apparently,
the winner of the Eat-down

438
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,009
{\an8}is the Simpsons.

439
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,931
{\an8}(cheering)

440
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,929
Isn't this a little too easy?

441
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,681
Why would a professional chef cheat?

442
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,604
And how does Nelson fit in?

443
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,812
And where the heck is our smoker?

444
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,603
("Take the A Train"
by Duke Ellington ringtone plays)

445
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,057
(phone beeps)

446
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,437
That's the ringtone from the scrap yard!

447
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,776
LISA:
Get him!

448
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,531
Bones! Bones!

449
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,366
I'm covered in death!

450
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,621
(gasps)

451
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,616
My hoops!

452
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,126
Dad, stop him!

453
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,958
I'm done trying.

454
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,213
Dad, please!
No one's asking you to care.

455
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,875
Just trip a stranger!

456
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,974
(grumbles)

457
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,307
A kid?
Why'd you steal our smoker?

458
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,225
Why'd you frame Scotty Boom?

459
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,073
'Cause he's my dad.

460
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,529
-I'm Tyler Boom.
-Huh?

461
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,989
My dad is so busy
shooting his TV shows

462
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:19,661
and going to the openings
and closings of his restaurants...

463
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,411
I never see him.

464
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,753
You destroyed your dad's career

465
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,909
so he'd spend more time with you?

466
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,328
Aw...

467
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,666
I met this kid Nelson

468
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,840
<i>playing</i> Clash of Castles<i> online.</i>

469
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,459
<i>You know, I knew my dad</i>
<i>was coming to your town,</i>

470
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,337
<i>so I hired Nelson to take your smoker.</i>

471
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,795
<i>And then my nanny</i>
<i>cooked some meat on it</i>

472
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,426
<i>and switched it</i>
<i>so it looked like my dad cheated.</i>

473
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,774
This was the only way.

474
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,270
The only way I thought of.

475
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,192
Son, why didn't you tell me
I was a terrible father?

476
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,612
Because I'm from New York.

477
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,730
We don't talk about our feelings, huh?

478
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,697
Yeah, I understand, son.
I'm from New York, too.

479
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,988
FDR Drive.

480
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,871
The West Side Highway.

481
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,118
Investment banking.

482
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,830
The gallery scene.

483
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,120
Knicks suck.

484
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,833
(crying)
Oh, Papa!

485
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,663
They suck so hard!

486
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,118
One more thing, Tyler.

487
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,998
Where's the Hive?

488
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,424
(gasping)

489
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,550
Oh...

490
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,972
(sizzling)

491
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,262
You're always so much hotter
than I think you're gonna be.

492
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,307
Thanks, guys, for not giving up,
then giving up,

493
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,561
then not giving up again,

494
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,944
then I forget.

495
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,651
<i>Barbecue is like family--</i>

496
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,361
<i>the cheap cuts of meat</i>
<i>that nobody wants.</i>

497
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,692
<i>But if you treat them right,</i>

498
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,607
<i>they turn into</i>
<i>the best thing in the world.</i>

499
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,116
Yeah, barbecue's yummy.
