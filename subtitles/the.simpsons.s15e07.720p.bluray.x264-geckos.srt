346

Presents are material goods,

347
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,192
and attachment
to material goods
kills the soul.

l'd better see my shrink

Do you think it was Papa?

369
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:34,112
l wouldn't put it past him.
He stole my gold tooth
the night he left.

He didn't leave.
He went to the store.

what Homer did was wrong

but l've been thinking.

382
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,440

that on this day
a million years ago,

a dude was born
who most of us
think was magic.

But others don't.
And that's cool.

probably right. Amen.

the only thing left to do

404
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,076
is return all your gifts!
