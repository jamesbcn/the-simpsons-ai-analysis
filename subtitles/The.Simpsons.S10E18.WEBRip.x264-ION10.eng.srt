{\an8}Whew. Oh, man, this is
the hottest Easter ever.

13
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,101

00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,768

{\an8}A chocolate bunny?

18
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,565
{\an8}Who put this wicked idol
in the collection plate?

00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,492
{\an8}(all gasp)

20
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,949
{\an8}Relax. I found it in the dumpster.

21
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,950
{\an8}Perhaps we need
a hefty dose of the good book.

{\an8}it's hard to hear you
with those fans going.

26
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,915
{\an8}Well, let's get those off then.

34
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,439
What a beautiful garden.

35
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,408
{\an8}It's almost like paradise.

{\an8}Aren't you hurt?

41
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,674
{\an8}Of course not.
There's no pain in the Garden of Eden.

42
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,751
{\an8}Hey, you must be Eve.

43
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,128
{\an8}I guess.

44
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,724
{\an8}Looks like God made you
out of my sexiest rib.

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,390
{\an8}Speaking of ribs,
is there any grub around here?

47
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,511
{\an8}Is there?

48
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,848
{\an8}(English accent) Good morning, Adam.

49
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,392
{\an8}Any bacon for you then?

50
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,845
{\an8}Don't mind if I do.

51
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,823
(Flanders's voice)
Hi-diddly-ho, paradise dwellers.

52
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:11,819
Good morning, Lord.

53
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,230
{\an8}I just have to compliment you

54
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,858
{\an8}on this beautifully-crafted mate.

55
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,855
{\an8}Oh, Adam, you're too kind.

56
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,527
{\an8}No, you're too kind...
And wise and righteous.

57
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,407
{\an8}I can't believe
you don't have a girlfriend.

58
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,463
{\an8}Oh, please, you're going
to give me a swelled head.

59
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,458
{\an8}I just stopped by to see
if you needed anything.

60
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,590
{\an8}Well, some general-interest
magazines would be nice.

61
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,548
{\an8}You got it, Eve.

62
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,459
{\an8}There you go.

63
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,706
{\an8}Oh, thanks.

64
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:35,877
{\an8}I better skedaddle.

65
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,375
{\an8}Oh, there's one more
weensy little thing.

66
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,048
See that tree over there?

67
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,716
I hate to be a Bossy Betty,

68
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,184
but I have to forbid you
to eat its fruit.

69
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,425
No problem, Lord,
and it would be even easier

70
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,517
to avoid that temptation
if I had a few extra wives.

71
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,444
(growling)

72
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,361
I'm just saying.

73
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,690
Oh, how cute!

74
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,815
Let's call this little
guy a groundhog.

75
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,782
Sorry, I already gave
him a name-- land monster.

76
00:03:58,863 --> 00:03:59,783
Really?

77
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,914
What do you call
that thing on the branch?

78
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,283
(hissing)

79
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,198
Branch monster.

80
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,865
Please, please,
call me snake.

81
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,165
Yo, have you dudes
sampled this fruit?

82
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,039
It's, like, god's private stash.

83
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,536
But he said it was forbidden.

84
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,588
Quite so, mum.

85
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,711
I recall one of the dinosaurs had a bite.

86
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,298
And, well, that was the last of-- egad.

87
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,139
Please stop eating that.

88
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,734
God's going to be furious.

89
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,559
You're pretty uptight
for a naked chick.

90
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,194
You know what would loosen you up?

91
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,691
A little fruit.

92
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,072
Well, it is a sin to waste food.

93
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,610
And you keep saying we need
to do things together.

94
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,492
Hmm.

95
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,735
Mmm! This could really spice up
those pies I've been making.

96
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,657
(thunder)

97
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,124
-What the dickens?
-(gasps)

98
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,674
Eve, did you taste
of the forbidden fruit?

99
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,882
(whistling)

100
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,420
Yes, God.

101
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,879
Doggone it, Eve.

102
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,384
I think you'd better
hightail it out of this garden.

103
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,256
Adam, say something.

104
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,563
Uh, uh, I think we should
see other people.

105
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,771
You heard me! Vamoose!

106
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,231
Oh!

107
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,778
Usually, a mink massage
makes me feel better,

108
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,702
but something's missing now.

109
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,030
I didn't say stop.

110
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,159
Lovely day in paradise,
isn't it?

111
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,543
Yeah, just like yesterday.

112
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,080
Today, I'm featuring
mouth-watering pork ribs.

113
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,205
Tuck in, then.

114
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,133
Oh.

115
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,130
I gave a rib to Eve
and now she's gone forever.

116
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,263
One whole rib, and still standing.

117
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,511
Well, aren't you
the plucky one, sir.

118
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,642
Come on!

119
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,049
Oh, poor Eve.

120
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,719
What are you doing out there
in that horrible place?

121
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,056
I'm toiling.
What does it look like?

122
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:52,849
This is my fault.

123
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,269
I should have
stood up for you

124
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,614
during that whole
Applegate thing.

125
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,768
It's a little late
for apologies now.

126
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,937
Don't say that.

127
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,485
Maybe I can
sneak you back in.

128
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,738
I mean, God can't be

129
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,109
everywhere at once, right?

130
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:08,447
(whistling "Alexander's
Ragtime Band")

131
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,704
Somebody order a hole?

132
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,366
Oh, that's a tight squeeze.

133
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,079
(panting)

134
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,745
Oh, thank you.

135
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,753
Are you okay?

136
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,254
I'll be fine. (panting)

137
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,876
Just give me a second to... Ah!

138
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,672
-(gasps)
-Come on, Eve. Hurry!

139
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,221
Oh, my dear, sweet Eve.

140
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,175
I love you even more

141
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:33,064
than the butterscotch pond
or the porno bush.

142
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,232
(thunder)

143
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,980
So, this is how you repay me, Adam!

144
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,815
And after I created my fingers
to the bone for you!

145
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,741
I...

146
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,989
Ahh! My unicorn!

147
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,816
Oh, what have they
done to you, Gary?

148
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,951
Oh, there, there.

149
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,374
I'm sure he's gone
to a better place, Lord.

150
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,003
Oh, shut up!

151
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,670
You are so banished!

152
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,288
Hey, now, let's not
do anything rash.

153
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,746
God is love, right?

154
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,496
(yells)

155
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,837
God, you have every right

156
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,882
to flip me out, too,
but before you...

157
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,126
(yells)

158
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,221
Oh, my back!

159
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,853
So this must be that pain thing.

160
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,930
(yells)

161
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,354
Oh, yeah, definitely pain.

162
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,904
(howling)

163
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,313
This sucks.

164
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,148
Things were so much better
back in the garden.

165
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,066
I'm sure God
will let us return soon.

166
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,116
I mean, how long
can he hold a grudge?

167
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,909
"...forever... and ever...

168
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,619
and ever and..."

169
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,633
...and that concludes Genesis,

170
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,508
the first of the 66 books
of the Bible.

171
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,507

00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,462
Talk to the whip.

181
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,963
(Bart grunts)

182
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,633
(horses neighing)

183
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,722
On your knees, you mugs.
It's the Pharaoh!

184
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,338
(sighs)

185
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,425
Ah, excellent progress,
slave-driver Willie.

186
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:32,756
Kudos on your whipping.

187
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,055
Oh, he noticed!

188
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,772
Oy! Suffering sarcophagus!

189
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,769
My tomb!

190
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,265
Who did this?

191
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,603
(snickering)

192
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,807
Come on, confess.

193
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,357
Don't make me slay all
the firstborn males again.

194
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,243
(deep voice) <i>Bart did it.</i>

195
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,858
<i>I saw him do it.</i>

196
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,784
Take him away, boys.

197
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,490
No, the bush set me up!

198
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,491
As for the rest of you,

199
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,617
it's time
for a little discipline.

200
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,834
Slave driver, put away
the encouragement whip

201
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,665
and break out the cruel whip.

202
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:05,961
(all gasping)

203
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,088
(whips cracking)

204
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,932
Ha! That's
the new omni-lash, boys.

205
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,099
Just look at that snapback.

206
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,098
Yeah, sweet.

207
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,056
We can't keep living like this.

208
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,849
Moses, ask Pharaoh
to let your people go.

209
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,444
Oh, now they're my people.

210
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,693
Scrub harder, slave.

211
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,776
I want to be able
to eat off that thing.

212
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,895
And make it snappy.

213
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:31,897
It's almost lunchtime.

214
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,781
LISA: Excuse me. Uh...

215
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,445
Pharaoh, I think Moses
here has something to ask you.

216
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,405
Go.

217
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,575
Let-my-people-go.

218
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,833
Let your people go?

219
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,957
I've never heard
such insolence.

220
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,383
You call yourselves slaves?

221
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,461
(grunts)

222
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,385
Well, the ball's
in his court now.

223
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,893
All right, read me back
what I have so far, Mrs. Krabapatra.

224
00:09:58,973 --> 00:09:59,813
Bird, bird,

225
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,600
Giant eye, pyramid, bird.

226
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,228
Mm-hmm. Very good.

227
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,900
Uh, giant eye, dead fish,
cat head, cat head, cat head...

228
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,362
Guy doing this...

229
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,937
(frogs croaking)

230
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,611
What the--

231
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,775
Keep that plague coming, Moses.

232
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,244
Frogs away!

233
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,581
(laughing)

234
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,039
We spent all our money,
but it was worth it.

235
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,830
Now he's got to let us go.

236
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,747
Mmm, these are the juiciest
frogs I've ever eaten.

237
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,711
Ra has rewarded my cruelty
to the slaves.

238
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,587
It's a plague, you moron!

239
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,134
And we've got
lots more planned.

240
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,717
And there's nothing
you can do about it!

241
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,347
-(screaming)
-So long, kids.

242
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,064
Give my regards
to the British museum.

243
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,563
(laughing)

244
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,404
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

245
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,402
(both grunting)

246
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,739
Do you think we could ever
be more than just friends?

247
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,489
Not now, Moses.

248
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,321
We got to find
a way out of here.

249
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,535
I know we built a secret passage

250
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,873
in here somewhere.

251
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,037
I found it!

252
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,749
We're out of here.

253
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,511
Uh-oh.

254
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,142
(both screaming)

255
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,642
Eh, slave labor.
You get what you pay for.

256
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,024
Whee!

257
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,516
Whee!

258
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,317
-(blows horn)
-Huh?

259
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,453
Our time has come!

260
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,860
Follow me to freedom!

261
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,993
(horn blowing)

262
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,833
(distant horn blowing)

263
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,828
WIGGUM: Hey, Pharaoh,

264
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:50,134
those half-pint slaves
are exodusing as we speak.

265
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,669
Well, I say good riddance
to bad rubbish.

266
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,513
Okay. But who's going
to build your pyramids?

267
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,429
Well, we-- (gasps) After them!

268
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,933
Oh, we'll never be able
to swim that far.

269
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,347
(horses neighing)

270
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,603
Oy, carumba.

271
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,774
Screw this. I'm converting.

272
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,113
Save us, o mighty Ra!

273
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,108
Hey! Cut that out. I have an idea.

274
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,611
All right, Moses, lead your people.

275
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,278
Flush!

276
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,196
(roar of flushing)

277
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,254
It's a miracle!
I performed a miracle!

278
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,883
I'm a genius!

279
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,420
Yeah, yeah. Hurry, everyone!

280
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,803
We don't have much time!

281
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,260
After them, men!

282
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,301
Into the temporarily-dry sea!

283
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,846
Ah, nuts.

284
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,386
(screaming)

285
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,782
Hey, chief, he splashed me.

286
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,162
Look, nobody likes
a crybaby, okay?

287
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,619
You just splash him back.

288
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,199
(kids cheering)

289
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,207
Well, Lisa, we're out of Egypt.

290
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,880
So, what's next for the Israelites?

291
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,418
Land of milk and honey?

292
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,172
Hmm, well, actually, it looks like

293
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,803
we're in for 40 years
of wandering the desert.

294
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,971
Forty years?

295
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,549
But after that, it's clear
sailing for the Jews, right?

296
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,848
Uh... more or less.
Hey, is that manna?

297
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,143
(kids cheering)

298
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,688
Now we come to King Solomon

299
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,988
whose wisdom was
like a drill...

300
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,622
boring into the rock of injustice.

301
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:51,618
LOVEJOY: Boring... boring...
boring...

302
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,042
(yawns)

303
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,749
King Solomon,
these men need you

304
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,418
to settle a dispute.

305
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,426
They each claim ownership
of this pie.

306
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,386
(sighs)

307
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,970
The pie shall be cut in two.

308
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:14,024
Then each man shall receive...
death.

309
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,313
(sighs)

310
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,935
I'll eat the pie.

311
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,239
Okay, next up,

312
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,362
"Jesus Christ versus
Checker Chariot."

313
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,455
Oh, Dad, you're
sitting on my arm.

314
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,921
(grunting)

315
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,341
"And after David smote Goliath

316
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,762
the people crowded
into the temple

317
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,429
where a cool breeze blew not.

318
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,388
And their hearts were
filled with crankiness."

319
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,764
And...

320
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,595
I'm bored. Send in my jester.

321
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,521
Hey, hey! King David!
How you doing?

322
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,358
Now, I'm not saying
Jezebel's easy,

323
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:07,204
but before she moved to Sodom,
it was known for its pottery!

324
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,241
(laughs)

325
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,244
What else you got?

326
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,485
Uh, wait a minute.

327
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,116
I got something
on the Canaanites.

328
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,213
Uh...
They are so stupid...

329
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,751
(gasping and groaning)

330
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,835
Methuselah, my oldest friend...

331
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,013
Who did this to you?

332
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,050
(groaning)

333
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,013
Oh... it was Goliath.

334
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,675
But Goliath is dead.

335
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,263
I smote him myself.

336
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,558
I smoted him good.

337
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,103
No! It was his son, Goliath Two.

338
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:40,941
No!

339
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,443
Goliath Two is gonna pay.

340
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,355
And this time, it's biblical.

341
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,122
{\an8}(typewriter clacking)

342
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,579
I'll just give Goliath Two
the old rock

343
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,917
to the head applause, applause,

344
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:01,841
you got to believe in yourself,

345
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,589
stay in school and we're out of here.

346
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,341
I don't know, Davey.

347
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,423
Quiet, you.

348
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,718
Oh, you've gotten pretty fat, Davey.

349
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,803
-(stomping)
-(gasping)

350
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,639
Let's get it on.

351
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:16,854
See you later, Davey.

352
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,265
You killed my best friend.

353
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,484
CROWD: Ooh.

354
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,864
You killed my father,
who was like a best friend.

355
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,863
CROWD: Ooh!

356
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:32,525
All I need is my trusty sling
and one good, hard...

357
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,576
Um...

358
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,909
Say... how's tomorrow for you?

359
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,963
(grunting)

360
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,504
(screams)

361
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,666
What say you now, Goliath?

362
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,165
Without your precious hair,

363
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,757
you no longer possess
your fantastic strength!

364
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,803
That's Samson, idiot.

365
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,892
Whoa!

366
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,519
(all gasp)

367
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,773
Let my proclamation
go out across the land!

368
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,146
Ha-ha!

369
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,652
CROWD: Ha-ha!

370
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,027
(screaming)

371
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,453
Oh... I hope this doesn't get
into the Bible.

372
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,991
You're King David.

373
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,334
I love you 'cause
you kill people.

374
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,787
Get yourself another hero, kid.

375
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,578
I'm all washed up.

376
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,378
Well, I guess it's up to Ralph
to stop Goliath.

377
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,205
(sheep bleating)

378
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,589
(Ralph humming)

379
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,678
Goliath Two is really gonna pay.

380
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,723
Get ready to meet
the first action hero.

381
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:40,845
(sheep bleating)

382
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,644
<i>♪ Winner takes it all ♪</i>

383
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,813
<i>♪ Till he breaks the fall ♪</i>

384
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,107
<i>♪ I'm trying to make it</i>
<i>over the top... ♪</i>

385
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,451
(grunts)

386
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,702
{\an8}(teletype clacking)

387
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,413
{\an8}BART: All right,
it's giant slayin' time.

388
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,502
(gasps)

389
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,462
Oops.

390
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,336
(man grunts)

391
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:09,918
Crap.

392
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,592
Hmm...

393
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,968
How am I supposed
to get up there?

394
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,352
(loud burp echoing)

395
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,652
Jonah!

396
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:30,573
Oh!

397
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,778
You died the way you lived...

398
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,275
Inside a whale.

399
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,118
(gasps)

400
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,662
Hmm...

401
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,333
(grunting)

402
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,375
I trampled four
giant-slayers today.

403
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,171
I think I earned this.

404
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,011
Don't you know

405
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,630
smoking stunts your growth?

406
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,097
Well, well, well, if it isn't
the little prince.

407
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,638
I'm not afraid of you, Goliath.

408
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,981
Before I was arrogant,
but now, my heart is humble

409
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,138
and my spirit is...

410
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,436
Oh!

411
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,191
(whimpering)

412
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,271
What do you know?
A king fit for a meal.

413
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,987
(whimpering)

414
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,568
Hope I don't give you...
Heartburn!

415
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,948
(screams)

416
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,716
Great news, everyone. Goliath is dead!

417
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,258
Although I haven't seen his body,

418
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,931
the blast that failed to kill me
surely killed the giant.

419
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,550
Anyhoo...

420
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,137
Now that I'm your king again...

421
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,558
(roaring)

422
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,137
(screaming)

423
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,072
Ralph, I thought you were dead.

424
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,244
Nope.

425
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,322
BART: Rejoice, good people!

426
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,237
Goliath the terrible
shall rule no more!

427
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,827
But Goliath was the greatest
king we ever had.

428
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,753
What?

429
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,670
He built roads,
hospitals, libraries...

430
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,000
To us, he was Goliath
the Consensus Builder.

431
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,923
You're under arrest
for megacide.

432
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,510
Where's your messiah now?

433
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,256
(crowd laughing)

434
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,487
(exclaims)

435
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,570
(snoring)

436
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,160
Everyone's gone!

437
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,874
How embarrassing.

438
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,044
Ooh, we slept right
through church.

439
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,421
Eh, it's not the end of the world.

440
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,513
(gasping)

441
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,930
(evil laughter)

442
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,312
Oh, no! It's the apocalypse!

443
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,599
Bart, are you wearing
clean underwear?

444
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,733
Not anymore.

445
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,979
It's the rapture

446
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,060
and I never knew true love.

447
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,225
I never used those
pizza coupons!

448
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,818
(choral music playing)

449
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,446
Why aren't we
ascending into heaven?

450
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,532
(thunder rumbling)

451
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,736
Oh, right... The sins.

452
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,334
-(choral music playing)
-(exclaims)

453
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,333
(choral music stops)

454
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,714
Where do you think
you're going, missy?

455
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,620
Dad!

456
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,328
(all scream)

457
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,005
Whoo, I smell barbecue!

458
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,259
(giggling) Hey, look!

459
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,465
(Homer screaming in terror)

460
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,683
Oh, they're out of hot dogs!

461
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,099
And the cole slaw
has pineapple in it!

462
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,305
(screaming)

463
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,063
