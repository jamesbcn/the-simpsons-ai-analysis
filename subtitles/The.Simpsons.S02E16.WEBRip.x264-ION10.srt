Oh, my,
you're burning up

and your cheeks
are so swollen.

36
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,602
(gasps) I think you have
the mumps.

Marge, the dog is hungry.

Hello, Dr. Hibbert?

50
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,469
This is Marge Simpson.

51
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,466
Not that I'm angry,

52
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,058
but how did you get
my home number?

53
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,194
(chuckles)
I see. Quite ingenious.

54
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,402
Doctor, I think Lisa
has the mumps.

55
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:15,902
(chuckles) Mrs. Simpson, much
as I'd like to rely on your diagnosis

56
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:19,277
I think it might be professionally
derelict of me to do so.

57
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,235
Let me check my schedule.

58
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:25,116
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, 2:00 is fine.
Thank you, Dr. Hibbert.

59
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,245
No way! She's faking!

60
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,422
If Lisa stays home,
I stay home.

61
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,920
If Bart stays home,
I'm going to school.

62
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,253
Fine. Then...

63
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,298
{\an8}Wait a minute.
If Lisa goes to school,

64
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,341
{\an8}then I go to school.

65
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,974
{\an8}But then Lisa stays home,

66
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,761
{\an8}so I stay home,
so Lisa goes to school.

67
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,314
Lisa, don't confuse
your brother like that.

68
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,928
Have a nice day
at school, Bart.

69
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,885
Get my homework
from Mrs. Hoover.

70
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:46,935
Homework?

71
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:50,268
Lisa, you wasted chicken pox.

72
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,395
Don't waste the mumps.

Hey, Otto man.

78
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:08,794
Yo, hairy bro.

79
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,333
Go home, boy.

80
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,326
Go home.

81
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,797

That canine of yours
is in my pool again.

95
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,751
I'm calling
the dog warden right now!

96
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,500
Oh, are you?

97
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:53,331
Well, you go ahead and call
your precious dog warden,

98
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,298
you old battle-ax,

99
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,008
because my dog
is tied up in the backyard.

100
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,719
There's only one family
on this block--

101
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,550
no, on Earth--

102
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,305
inconsiderate enough to let
a monster like that roam free.

103
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,098
D'oh!

104
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:10,181
Are you losing your hearing,
or are you just stupid?

105
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,148
I am going to explain this
to you one more time,

106
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,729
and then I'm going
to hang up on you.

107
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,484
It is not my dog!

108
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:23,408
I tied my dog outside myself!

109
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,529
I am looking at him right--
D'oh!

110
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,536
Well, howdly-do, Simpson.
Getting a little exercise, huh?

111
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,134
Good for you, pal.

112
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,879
Oh, look at this old rascal.

113
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,421
He's a wet old baby boy,
isn't he?

114
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,215
You're just a water monster.

115
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:45,009
Well, well. Mr. Universe
takes a walk. Ha ha.

116
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,354
(chuckles)
Mr. Universe-- I wish.

117
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,140

Heavy hands, ankle weights--

118
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,555
that's cute--
and...

119
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,273
(gasp)
Assassins!

120
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,815
Oh, you betcha. You know,
they got the Velcro straps,

121
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,819
a water pump in the tongue,
built-in pedometer,

122
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:03,111
reflective sidewalls,
and little vanity license plates.

123
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,736
Ohh! Ohh! How much?
How much? How much?

124
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,492
Well, you know, they're not
giving them away,

125
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,035
but sometimes you've just
got to spoil yourself.

126
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,409
-Yeah.
-(beeping)

127
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,866
Oop. My heart rate's
dropping.

128
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,915
Better skedaddly-do.

129
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,132
LISA: Ahh.

130
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,381
HIBBERT: Mm-hmm.

131
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,922
Discoloration

Swelling of the parotids...

134
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,553
I knew it.

135
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,175
Yeah, looks like little
Lisa has the mumps.

136
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,472
I guess you'll be missing
a week of school, young lady.

137
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,226
Oh no. I don't want
to fall behind my class.

138
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,809
(laughing)

139
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,065
Oh, such responsibility
for such a little girl.

140
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,568
What's your
favorite subject?

141
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,860
-Arithmetic.
-Oh ho, ho, ho...

142
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,994
Arithmetic. Now before you
know it, you'll be back among

143
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:50,582
your polygons, your hypotenuse,
and your Euclidean algorithms.

144
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,660
Now you get rest
and have yourself a wahwee pop.

145
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,866
(phone ringing)

146
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,207
Yello?

147
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,541
Hi, Lisa.
What's wrong?

148
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,747
The mumps?

149
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,667
Ooh, the kissing disease.

150
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,545
(chuckles)
My little girl is growing up.

151
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,683
(laughing)

152
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,719
Yuck. Quit it, Dad.

153
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,643
So what does
my little girl want?

154
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,431
What? Let me
write this down.

155
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:17,396
Copies of "Teen Dream,"

156
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,728
"Teen Scream,"

157
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:22,533
and "Teen Steam" magazine?

158
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:26,568
Well, okay, you're the sickie.
Good-bye, Lisa.

159
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,664
Hey, Lenny, I need to leave early.
Cover for me, will ya?

160
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,660
Hey, sure thing, Homer.

161
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,254
(contented sigh)

162
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,829
(smacking)

163
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,996
Well, Lisa, here it is--

164
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,045
the Bouvier family quilt.

165
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,209
(sniffing)

166
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,837
Wow! Neat!
It smells historic.

167
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,835
(gasps) Ooh.

168
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,757
For five generations

169
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,347
women in our family
have each added a square to it.

170
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,143
Now it's your turn.

171
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,596
LISA: Oh. But I don't know
how to sew.

172
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,357
Oh, yes, you do.
You just don't know it.

173
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,269
The memory of a
million drop stitches

174
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,317
flows in your veins.

175
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,816
-Ah.
-Very impressive.

176
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,737
-You try it.
-Oww!

177
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,616
You just need
to develop a callous.

178
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,293
(humming tune)

179
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,502

00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,765
You do?

354
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:18,811
♪ Ha ha ha ha ha! ♪

355
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:22,064
Homer, please.
It's not just the quilt.

356
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,147
He's a nice dog,
but he chews up everything.

357
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,653
He doesn't obey.
He's not even housebroken,

358
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,735
and we've spent all this money
on an obedience school,

359
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,741
and I don't see
any improvement.

360
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,243
Alright, alright.
If Santa's Little Helper

361
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,124
studies real hard,
and passes his finals

362
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,411
and becomes
a perfect dog,

363
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,535
-can we keep him then?
-No!

364
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,422
-Dad!
-This is our pet.

365
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,420
We can question
his integrity and disposition,

366
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,093
but we can't question
his heart.

367
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,052
Are you trying to teach us
that the way to solve a problem

368
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,934
with something you love
is to throw it away?

369
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,472
(crying)
Oh, Lisa.

370
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,557
If they're ever going
to pull the plug on me,

371
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,853
I want you
in my corner, honey.

372
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,477
Oh, all right.

373
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,984
If he passes obedience school,
we can keep him.

374
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,396
-All right.
-Yay.

375
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,444
(coughs)

376
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,822
BART: See, boy,
it's not so hard.

377
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:15,025
Here, roll over.
Roll over!

378
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,077
Like this.

379
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,661
Congratulations, Sonny.

380
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,246
You've earned a toffee.

381
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,330
Oh, thank you.

382
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,995
(quietly)
You moldy old maid.

383
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,963
Homer, can't we place this ad

384
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,254
after the dog
fails his test?

385
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,087
No. We have
to commit ourselves.

386
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,513
Now take this down.

387
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:34,551
Free to loving home,
world's most brilliant dog.

388
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,676
Says "I love you"
on command.

389
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,184
-(grumbling)
-Type, type.

390
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,887
Now!

391
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,227
Sit!

392
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,524
I said, "sit."

393
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:50,027
Um, take a walk.
Sniff that other dog's butt.

394
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,200
See? He does exactly
what I tell him.

395
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,530
HOMER: Oh, no.
We'd never give him away

396
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,196
but we're moving to another country
where dogs are forbidden.

397
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,865
You're what?

398
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,253
Oh, sure.

399
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,790
Come here, boy.

400
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,463
Put that prowler down.
Come here. Come on, boy.

401
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,042
(panting)

402
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,337
Say it, boy. Say "I love you"
for the nice man.

403
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,341
(panting)
I ruv ru.

404
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,553
Good dog!

405
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,633
Good doggie.

406
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,087
Isn't that amazing?

407
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,597
See you soon.
Woo-hoo!

408
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,889
A lot of you think your dogs have
mastered the "stay" command.

409
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:25,404
Let's see if they can "stay"
away from this Beef Wellington.

410
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,819
Now, stay.

411
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,568
(panting)

412
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,901
Stay, boy!
Stay! Stay!

413
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,396
Stay!

414
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,368
(chomping)

415
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,949
Oh, he'd be very happy
at my farm.

416
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,405
People think only mules
can pull carts.

417
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,036
Impatient people think that.

418
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,713
-But patient people know better.
-(yelps)

419
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,342
HOMER:
<i>He can pick him up tomorrow.</i>

420
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,881
Mrs. Winthrop,
I was thinking.

421
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,807
-Ah! Oh!
-Oh, dear.

422
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:04,639
Since you get paid either way,
would it be a big deal

423
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,976
to just let my dog pass?

424
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,772
I see. Rubber stamp, thank you
very much, next in line.

425
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:11,898
-Is that it?
-Yeah.

426
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,994
Heavens to murgatroid.
But!

427
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,490
Perhaps I cling to the old
ways like a well-chewed shoe,

428
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,785
as the traditions I was
weaned on are put to sleep

429
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,620
or neutered one by one.

430
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,786
But my time has not passed yet!

431
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,456
The world does not need
another college graduate

432
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,546
who doesn't know how to sit!

433
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,471
He'll sit, he'll sit.

434
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,090
Come on, boy, sit.

435
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,337
Sit.

436
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,598
Blah-blah, blah-blah.

437
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,220
-Pull the chain.
-Huh?

438
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,387
-Correct the dog.
-I don't wanna strangle my dog.

439
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,226
Pull the bloody chain, boy!

440
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,980
(yelping)

441
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,185
(whimpering)

442
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,736
I'm sorry, boy.
You can't help being dumb.

443
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,453
Hmm, what are
you doing, dear?

444
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,031
Sewing a new quilt.

445
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,116
You know, it's one thing
to be a link in a chain.

446
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,082
It's another
to start one of your own.

447
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,212
Aw...

448
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,918
This patch commemorates

449
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,578
the destruction
of the old quilt.

450
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:16,047
Well, you certainly
captured the moment. Mwah!

451
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,591
Come on, boy.

452
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,644
Sit.

453
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,968
Sit... sit...

454
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,763
Sit!
Oh, come on, sit!

455
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,467
Oh, man.

456
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,227
Bart, he's not going
to learn it now.

457
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,019
Don't spend your
last hours together

458
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,062
tormenting
the poor creature.

459
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,516
Have some fun.
Frolic with him.

460
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,190
Go get it, boy!

461
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,414
(sighs)

462
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,750
-(growling)
-(growling)

463
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,005
I'm gonna miss you, boy.

464
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,013
I thought we were going
to be pals forever.

465
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:08,226
But we're going to
have to say good-bye,

466
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,018
because you don't understand
a single word I say.

467
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,903
If you just knew how important
it was to learn...

468
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,321
blah blah sit.

469
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,437
Wait a minute, you did it.

470
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,069
Blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah.

471
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,815
Lay down.

472
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,698
Shake hands?

473
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,869
Stay.

474
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,165
-Speak.
-(barks)

475
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,209
All right!
Good boy!

476
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,093
Roll over.

477
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,421
You son of a bitch.

478
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,717
Good show!

479
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,390

00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,143
