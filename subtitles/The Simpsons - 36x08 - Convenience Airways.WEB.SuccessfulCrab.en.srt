1
00:00:09,251 --> 00:00:11,751
<i>C-SPAN 5 now takes you to testimony</i>

2
00:00:11,753 --> 00:00:14,588
<i>before the Joint Committee
on Terrible Events.</i>

3
00:00:17,864 --> 00:00:20,777
The Chair recognizes the woman
with the four-foot beehive.

4
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:23,205
Please state your name and occupation.

5
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:25,540
Uh, Marjorie Bouvier Simpson.

6
00:00:25,617 --> 00:00:27,525
Mother to three children

7
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,026
and a husband.

8
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,029
She's raising us all on her own.

9
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,534
Mrs. Simpson, please walk us through

10
00:00:36,612 --> 00:00:38,945
the events of March 12.

11
00:00:38,947 --> 00:00:41,965
Well, it all started with
what was supposed to be

12
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,725
a happy family trip.

13
00:00:43,802 --> 00:00:48,063
The Simpsons are going
to Pile Ridge, Louisiana.

14
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,807
Oh, the trip is already ruined.

15
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,567
What is this gunk?

16
00:00:52,644 --> 00:00:55,237
Oh, that's my lentil soup.

17
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,905
Lisa!

18
00:00:56,907 --> 00:00:58,965
Well, what else am I supposed to eat

19
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:02,469
at your family's barbaric pig butchery?

20
00:01:02,471 --> 00:01:04,579
It's<i> boucherie.</i>

21
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:06,973
It's a cherished Bouvier tradition

22
00:01:06,975 --> 00:01:09,233
that reunites our extended family

23
00:01:09,311 --> 00:01:12,236
and celebrates our Cajun roots.

24
00:01:12,314 --> 00:01:13,588
And they shoot the pig in the head,

25
00:01:13,665 --> 00:01:16,316
John Wick-style. Look.

26
00:01:16,318 --> 00:01:18,209
Stop, it's horrifying.

27
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,154
Mmm. Delicious.

28
00:01:22,744 --> 00:01:24,599
Horrifying!

29
00:01:24,676 --> 00:01:26,843
Mr. Simpson, as I understand it,

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,922
you were enticed by the thought
of enjoying savory meats,

31
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:34,668
but repulsed by the appearance
of your wife's family.

32
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,170
Yes, Senator, I cannot perjure myself.

33
00:01:37,172 --> 00:01:39,281
They are barf in human form.

34
00:01:39,283 --> 00:01:40,615
I reclaim my time.

35
00:01:40,617 --> 00:01:43,443
Traveling brings out
Homer's worst qualities.

36
00:01:44,846 --> 00:01:49,015
Oh! All the seats are taken
by jerks and their bags.

37
00:01:49,017 --> 00:01:51,217
Maybe we can sit in there.

38
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:52,544
- _
- That looks comfy.

39
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,280
Squirt em' if you got em'.

40
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,208
Oh!

41
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,952
Your hoops are quivering. Calm down.

42
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,121
Now boarding: Active-duty TV clowns.

43
00:02:06,702 --> 00:02:09,126
Some sober companion you are.

44
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:10,720
I'm only three hours out of rehab

45
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,647
and I can smell the booze on you.

46
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:14,799
You mean my hand sanitizer?

47
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:16,943
Ooh, Daddy want!

48
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,563
Mrs. Simpson, we're overbooked.

49
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,139
Your seats are no longer together.

50
00:02:22,217 --> 00:02:23,383
This is bull!

51
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:25,885
I demand to speak to Sully Sullenberger!

52
00:02:25,887 --> 00:02:27,329
Homer, stop it.

53
00:02:27,405 --> 00:02:30,390
You always do this.
You'll get us banned.

54
00:02:30,392 --> 00:02:32,984
So? We'll take our business elsewh...

55
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:36,320
There is no elsewhere.

56
00:02:36,398 --> 00:02:38,231
Because of your past behavior,

57
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:39,841
you're on the No Fly List

58
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:42,902
of every other airline in the country.

59
00:02:42,904 --> 00:02:44,221
Even Spirit.

60
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:46,014
Try it again.

61
00:02:49,578 --> 00:02:52,929
So, unless you want
all our future vacations

62
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:56,266
to be at my mother's house,
talking her into hospice,

63
00:02:56,418 --> 00:02:59,769
you will hold it
together on this flight.

64
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:02,179
I promise, Marge. I won't let you down.

65
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,757
I do have some good news.

66
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:06,609
We have one free upgrade
for a seat in first class.

67
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:09,445
Ooh, I bet I'd really
keep my promise to behave

68
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,282
if I'm in that spacious lie-flat pod.

69
00:03:12,284 --> 00:03:13,950
Well, you'll never know.

70
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,460
Yoink.

71
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:22,033
Uh-uh, sweetie, first class is this way.

72
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,126
Welcome.

73
00:03:23,277 --> 00:03:24,277
Oh, my God.

74
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,628
I'm turning left.

75
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,131
I didn't know planes had a left.

76
00:03:29,268 --> 00:03:30,892
Ah. Ooh.

77
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,854
Oh...

78
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:39,976
Oh, the seat is so plush and comfy.

79
00:03:39,978 --> 00:03:41,385
May I get you anything?

80
00:03:41,463 --> 00:03:43,071
I want everything.

81
00:03:43,148 --> 00:03:45,556
The whole first class experience.

82
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:49,226
Cold bubbly, warm nuts, hot towel...

83
00:03:49,304 --> 00:03:51,487
all the temperatures!

84
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:54,808
Let's start you out with a
complimentary Moet mimosa

85
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,810
with extra zest and a little...

86
00:03:56,812 --> 00:03:57,919
Oh.

87
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,819
Okay, Homer, you can do this.

88
00:04:05,821 --> 00:04:08,488
Have a pleasant flight for Marge.

89
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,990
- Ow, my head!
- Watch it!

90
00:04:10,992 --> 00:04:12,100
Ow!

91
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,343
<i>God, don't let this slob</i>

92
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,752
<i>be next to me.</i>

93
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,104
<i>God, don't let this slob</i>

94
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:17,680
<i>be next to me.</i>

95
00:04:19,017 --> 00:04:20,257
Good morning, everyone.

96
00:04:20,335 --> 00:04:21,351
My name is Joel,

97
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,354
and I'll be your "wingman" today.

98
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:27,482
Thank you.

99
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:30,452
Just a reminder: Federal law
prohibits smoking of any kind,

100
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:33,437
unless, like me, you're smokin' hot.

101
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:38,126
Oh, great.

102
00:04:38,203 --> 00:04:40,462
Forced comedy at 9:00 in the morning.

103
00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:44,132
Now, Maggie,
screens turn brains to mush.

104
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:46,635
That's why Bart has to take ESL classes.

105
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:49,304
I'll parent you how I
wanted to be parented,

106
00:04:49,381 --> 00:04:52,215
and sibling you how I
wanted to be sibbled,

107
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:56,293
with my Jazz Legends A-to-Z flashcards.

108
00:04:56,371 --> 00:04:58,129
Cannonball Adderley.

109
00:04:58,206 --> 00:05:00,982
He was more hard bop then bebop.

110
00:05:00,984 --> 00:05:02,558
Okay, movie fans, it's time for

111
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:05,044
everybody's favorite in-flight flick,

112
00:05:05,046 --> 00:05:06,470
the safety demo.

113
00:05:06,548 --> 00:05:08,990
Remember this come Oscar time.

114
00:05:12,554 --> 00:05:16,556
Good thing I've got
my annoyance-canceling headphones.

115
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:19,650
Ooh, we are really packed
in here, aren't we?

116
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:22,745
Something is very wrong with this plane.

117
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,488
This is a trap!

118
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:26,249
It's a conspiracy to take us down!

119
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:27,658
- Get out of here!
- Oh. Oh!

120
00:05:27,736 --> 00:05:29,252
They're experimenting on us!

121
00:05:29,254 --> 00:05:31,754
I won't be a rat in your flying cage!

122
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:35,408
Ah, a seat for my second cheek.

123
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,743
Yo, travel trolls.

124
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:38,745
A crazy lady just got
kicked off the plane

125
00:05:38,763 --> 00:05:41,672
so I jump-squatted a sweet aisle seat.

126
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,693
Give my 40,000 followers
a moan, bald dude.

127
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:46,677
D'oh.

128
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,421
♪ <i>D'oh, d'oh</i> ♪

129
00:05:48,423 --> 00:05:50,347
♪ <i>D-d-d-d-d-d'oh</i> ♪

130
00:05:50,425 --> 00:05:52,659
♪ <i>D-d-d-d-d-d'oh.</i> ♪

131
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:55,954
Toenail clipper?

132
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,081
Sardine eater?

133
00:05:59,117 --> 00:06:01,434
Disgusto-flossers?

134
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:02,936
Hiya!

135
00:06:02,938 --> 00:06:04,862
Karate children?

136
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,441
Marge, I'm trying to hold it together,

137
00:06:08,443 --> 00:06:10,793
just like I promised.

138
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:18,618
But it seems like this
plane is filled with

139
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,896
all the worst flyers in the world.

140
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:23,473
Well, his text was correct, senator.

141
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,401
Our airline serves the
fastest-growing demographic

142
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:29,295
in air travel: the criminally obnoxious.

143
00:06:29,297 --> 00:06:30,572
At Convenience Airways,

144
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:33,833
<i>we fly the No Fly List.</i>

145
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:44,801
Mr. Wingspan...
if that is your funny name...

146
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:46,329
you mean to tell us

147
00:06:46,331 --> 00:06:49,832
that you filled an entire
plane with obnoxious people

148
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:51,609
who were banned from other airlines?

149
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,504
Yes. Our business model
is to cater to C.I.F.s:

150
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:57,931
"Civility Impaired Fliers."

151
00:06:58,009 --> 00:06:59,933
- Hiya!
- Control your team!

152
00:06:59,935 --> 00:07:03,121
Violence is a form of control.

153
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:05,665
Yes, Sensei. Hiya!

154
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,517
This was our inaugural flight,

155
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:11,354
testing if the innovative
precautions we had taken

156
00:07:11,356 --> 00:07:15,542
were enough to safely transport
the rudest of the rude.

157
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:17,543
- Like this man.
- _

158
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:19,362
Aw, come on.

159
00:07:19,364 --> 00:07:22,456
You choke out one guy
with a seat belt extender

160
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:23,790
and you're labeled for life.

161
00:07:23,868 --> 00:07:25,384
But on this flight,

162
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:27,553
I promised Marge I would behave,

163
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,313
and I really tried.

164
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,797
It was torture.

165
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:32,150
<i>Torture!</i>

166
00:07:33,544 --> 00:07:36,320
Who would do such a
thing to Patrick Wilson?

167
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:38,698
Eyes on your own screen.

168
00:07:40,234 --> 00:07:41,092
Ugh.

169
00:07:41,143 --> 00:07:42,976
And, no, you may not have any of

170
00:07:43,054 --> 00:07:45,388
my triad of expired Christmas delights.

171
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,831
Mmm, cheese.

172
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:49,167
Mmm, butter, caramel...

173
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,337
Mmm.

174
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,656
And now, the shower of champions.

175
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,049
Huzzah.

176
00:08:02,193 --> 00:08:02,755
Come on.

177
00:08:02,831 --> 00:08:04,182
Uh, excuse me.

178
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,926
I promised my wife I
wouldn't fight or yell

179
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:09,078
or pee anywhere other than the bathroom,

180
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,006
but this guy next to me
is making it really hard.

181
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,433
What guy?

182
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,419
The Comic Book Guy guy.

183
00:08:16,421 --> 00:08:18,437
Huh? He just disappeared.

184
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:22,258
Well, it looks like the
problem took care of itself.

185
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,260
That is so weird.

186
00:08:24,262 --> 00:08:26,929
Hey, guys, you asked for it,
I'm doing it.

187
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:30,449
The bathroom sink
shrimp scampi challenge.

188
00:08:30,526 --> 00:08:31,951
Oh.

189
00:08:31,953 --> 00:08:35,421
<i>Marge, I'm barely
holding it together back here.</i>

190
00:08:35,456 --> 00:08:39,625
<i>Please text me back some
sweet words of comfort.</i>

191
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:47,808
Hey, hey...

192
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,746
- Huzzah...
- Hey, hey...

193
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,689
Zounds...

194
00:08:58,145 --> 00:08:59,478
Oh...

195
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,647
needs tonic.

196
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:08,162
Die, die, die!

197
00:09:09,307 --> 00:09:11,398
No, don't die!

198
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,899
They're all dead.

199
00:09:12,977 --> 00:09:15,044
Oh, I need to play something.

200
00:09:17,982 --> 00:09:19,740
I'm winning. I'm winning.

201
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:21,259
Just a reminder, folks,

202
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:24,169
the call button is only
for real emergencies,

203
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:27,339
like if you're down to
your last guess on Wordle.

204
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,177
Uh, I have a real emergency.

205
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:33,662
Your jokes suck.

206
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,442
"S" is for Sun Ra.

207
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:39,760
He's a little abstract,

208
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:43,022
but when you get it,
you'll really get it.

209
00:09:43,098 --> 00:09:44,840
Dig this.

210
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:53,198
Somebody shut that brat up!

211
00:09:53,317 --> 00:09:54,458
Oh, that's my brat.

212
00:09:54,535 --> 00:09:55,684
Stop judging her!

213
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:57,036
I don't know what to do.

214
00:09:57,188 --> 00:10:00,280
I've been turning the
jazz up as loud as I can,

215
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,133
but it's not soothing her.

216
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:04,451
Is this an airline or a nursery?

217
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,378
Mustn't punch the jerk.

218
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,621
Mustn't punch the jerk.

219
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:10,457
It's so loud, I can barely hear myself

220
00:10:10,535 --> 00:10:12,626
feel up my mistress under this blanket.

221
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:14,478
Okay, gang, we're about to start

222
00:10:14,555 --> 00:10:16,705
our beverage and snack service.

223
00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:18,057
If you feel like a pretzel,

224
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:19,650
that means the guy in front of you

225
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:22,486
has his seat all the way back.

226
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:26,398
Just because it sounds like a joke

227
00:10:26,475 --> 00:10:27,733
doesn't mean it is one.

228
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:32,145
Come back in ten years, kid.

229
00:10:32,223 --> 00:10:35,240
I got voicemails older than you. Ha!

230
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,263
And now it's time
for your headliner. Me!

231
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:43,257
This guy's jokes suck so hard,

232
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:45,167
we're about to lose cabin pressure.

233
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,172
Okay, okay. People, don't encourage him!

234
00:10:50,248 --> 00:10:52,766
...is what Joel's guidance
counselor told his parents.

235
00:10:55,846 --> 00:10:57,146
Give me that.

236
00:10:58,682 --> 00:11:02,167
This is your unfunny
flight attendant Joel speaking.

237
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:04,853
Here are some more of my terrible jokes.

238
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,018
Left forward lavatory.

239
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:21,829
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

240
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:25,374
Okay, so Daddy
doesn't get into a fistfight,

241
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,876
we're going to take a little walk.

242
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,639
Dad, I figured out
what's gonna calm Maggie.

243
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:35,367
Improvisations in the style
of pre-heroin Coltrane.

244
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,987
Mama!

245
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:49,548
No, no, we can't bother Mommy...

246
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,142
...or she'll leave us all for good.

247
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,647
Hey, champ, I lost $50,000

248
00:11:57,725 --> 00:12:00,834
on your pay-per-view
fight against Vanilla Ice.

249
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:02,318
You owe me!

250
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:07,232
Come on, champ,
I'm talking to you, champ.

251
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:09,084
Oh, no, my Chekhov's gin.

252
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:17,500
Nobody licks me but my tiger.

253
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:22,022
That baby's a lap-sitting freeloader.

254
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:25,267
I am sorry you have to
put up with that guy.

255
00:12:25,343 --> 00:12:27,102
We're all just doing our best.

256
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:31,273
Yeah. Parents don't get to
go into airplane mode, do we?

257
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:34,350
Thank God. Two sensible people.

258
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,430
Wylder, it's time.

259
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:40,615

00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:43,118
Oh, no... No, no, no.

262
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,380
Our little guy is on a strict
potty training schedule.

No hoo!

267
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:59,226
Um, do you guys have any diapers?

268
00:12:59,377 --> 00:13:01,470
Uh, we don't use the "D" word.

269
00:13:01,546 --> 00:13:02,788
Oh, boy.

270
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,457
- Deal with your biohazard!
- Change that baby!

271
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,067
- What's wrong with you?
- Oh, come on!

272
00:13:07,144 --> 00:13:09,069
That's not a baby, that's a hate crime.

273
00:13:09,784 --> 00:13:11,296
Lisa, where's the diaper bag?

274
00:13:11,315 --> 00:13:12,464
I don't have it.

275
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:15,242
Why don't you ask
your girlfriend, Maggie?

276
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:17,727
Maggie's not my girlfriend, Marge is.

277
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:21,039
That's it. Marge has it.

278
00:13:26,517 --> 00:13:27,491
There's the bag.

279
00:13:27,498 --> 00:13:29,498
Maggie, crawl through the clown fight.

280
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:35,487
Don't kill him, champ.

281
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:37,489
My pension is almost vested.

282
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,107
Okay, Maggie, to the bathroom.

283
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:01,288
We made it.

284
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:04,141
Toilet Chef.

285
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:08,378
In-laws!

286
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:12,466
Care to join our Mile-High Book Club?

287
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,301
Readers!

288
00:14:17,364 --> 00:14:18,713
SunChips. Give me, give me.

289
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,276
What the...?

290
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,889
Where is everybody?

291
00:14:36,016 --> 00:14:38,833
Please calmly return to your seat, sir.

292
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:41,185
What did you do with all
the horrible people I hate?

293
00:14:41,262 --> 00:14:42,445
Tell me what's going on.

294
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:44,263
Or I'll seatbelt you good.

295
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,674
And why don't they make the
whole plane out of the...

296
00:14:46,693 --> 00:14:49,511
black box material...?

297
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:50,862
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

298
00:14:51,014 --> 00:14:53,214
<i>If you look to your left, you will see</i>

299
00:14:53,216 --> 00:14:54,958
<i>the magnificent Grand Canyon.</i>

300
00:14:55,035 --> 00:15:00,021
<i>Unless you're one of the
246 unruly souls who've been</i>

301
00:15:00,023 --> 00:15:04,301
<i>trap-doored into our
complimentary in-flight prison.</i>

302
00:15:15,405 --> 00:15:18,890
Trapdoors that lead to a prison?
Since when?

303
00:15:18,892 --> 00:15:22,227
What monster could conceive
of something this horrible?

304
00:15:22,229 --> 00:15:23,670
BurnsCo.

305
00:15:23,747 --> 00:15:27,248
<i>Proudly installing trapdoor
dungeon drops since 1926.</i>

306
00:15:27,325 --> 00:15:29,067
Is there anything more satisfying

307
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:32,237
than a scream of terror
followed by a distant thud?

308
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:34,181
Mr. Wingspan, this is America.

309
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,349
When we violate people's
civil liberties,

310
00:15:36,426 --> 00:15:39,427
we usually give them a heads-up,
drop pamphlets,

311
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:41,837
send a cruise missile, uh, something.

312
00:15:41,915 --> 00:15:45,583
Senator, I assure you,
we did warn the passengers

313
00:15:45,585 --> 00:15:48,528
of the potential consequences
of their actions.

314
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,031
It's all in the safety video.

315
00:15:51,107 --> 00:15:53,182
But nobody watches those things.

316
00:15:57,855 --> 00:15:59,689
<i>Should you choose to be unruly,</i>

317
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:03,376
<i>you'll be trap-doored into
our belly-of-the-plane prison.</i>

318
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:05,861
<i>If your behavior is too extreme,</i>

319
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:08,215
<i>a ball gag will fall from the ceiling.</i>

320
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,366
<i>Please affix your own ball gag first</i>

321
00:16:10,368 --> 00:16:13,220
<i>before ball-gagging your child.</i>

322
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:15,037
See? I was right.

323
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:17,707
I tried to warn you,
but you all thought I was crazy.

324
00:16:17,784 --> 00:16:21,119
Not to criticize,
but maybe it's your tone?

325
00:16:21,137 --> 00:16:22,954
My tone is fine!

326
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,976
And that concludes
your beverage service.

327
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,887
He's pretty funny.

328
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:33,965
No, he's not, he sucks.

329
00:16:33,984 --> 00:16:35,358
Take that!

330
00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:39,137
They can't do this to us!

331
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:42,415
Buying a ticket gives us the
right to do what we want.

332
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:44,900
There's no law in the sky.

333
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:46,828
I say we bust out.

334
00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:48,162
Who's with me?

335
00:16:50,484 --> 00:16:53,075
We'll need every available weapon.

336
00:16:53,153 --> 00:16:55,929
I got toenail clippers.
And some pretty sharp toenails.

337
00:16:56,006 --> 00:16:59,724
I got an airsick bag
of hot bathroom shrimp.

338
00:17:01,344 --> 00:17:02,994
<i>My darling Marge.</i>

339
00:17:02,996 --> 00:17:05,847
<i>I am writing you from the cusp
of yet another prison riot.</i>

340
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:08,275
<i>If I die in this heroic escape attempt,</i>

341
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,001
<i>remember me as a blameless victim.</i>

342
00:17:10,003 --> 00:17:13,596
<i>One who got caught up in the
coach-to-prison pipeline.</i>

343
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:16,007
<i>BTW, lost Maggie, hope she's with you.</i>

344
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:18,434
<i>Lots going on. Shrug emoji.</i>

345
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:31,781
Marge is writing me back.

346
00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:33,949
Stop? Stop what?

347
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,469
Wine, wine, wine?

348
00:17:36,546 --> 00:17:38,713
Do you want me to stop whining?

349
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,717
Bee. Man.

350
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:44,369
Be a man?

351
00:17:44,371 --> 00:17:46,204
X. Lobster.

352
00:17:46,206 --> 00:17:48,373
Don't be shellfish?

353
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:51,967
Oh, my God,
I am always thinking of my shelf.

354
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:54,136
Window seat.

355
00:17:54,214 --> 00:17:57,549
Window seat. Window seat.

356
00:17:57,551 --> 00:17:59,809
No! This revolt is wrong.

357
00:17:59,886 --> 00:18:02,144
I know this because my
wife just spoke to me

358
00:18:02,222 --> 00:18:05,314
in a series of direct
and unambiguous emojis.

359
00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:08,409
Let us not be pigs. Or mules.

360
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:10,653
Or a mermaid with a fax machine.

361
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,822
Sure, we have to put up
with baggage fees,

362
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:17,735
no leg room,
and those $20 "protein boxes."

363
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:20,738
But flying is a modern miracle,

364
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,166
and all that's asked of us in return

365
00:18:24,244 --> 00:18:28,079
is basic human decency.

366
00:18:30,007 --> 00:18:33,193
Mm, I could be more patient
with kids and babies.

367
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:35,937
After all, I am a preschool teacher.

368
00:18:35,939 --> 00:18:39,273
I'm sorry I savagely beat your
husband with your hair bone.

369
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,184
He's not my...

370
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,186
Oh, forget it.

371
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:46,021
So to quote my wife,

372
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:48,541
we have to start acting civilized

373
00:18:48,618 --> 00:18:52,620
and stop being a bunch of huge...

374
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:54,422
eggplants.

375
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:57,717
<i>Well, folks,
now that you've exhibited</i>

376
00:18:57,794 --> 00:18:59,386
<i>a modicum of civility,</i>

377
00:18:59,462 --> 00:19:01,221
<i>the handcuff sign has been turned off.</i>

378
00:19:01,297 --> 00:19:03,706
<i>You are now free to return to your seats</i>

379
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,450
<i>and work through the childhood trauma</i>

380
00:19:05,452 --> 00:19:07,209
<i>that led you to behave like the ugliest</i>

381
00:19:07,287 --> 00:19:09,562
<i>of ugly Americans today.</i>

382
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,721
Excuse me, Mrs. Simpson.

383
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:20,632
We'll be landing soon, so we need you

384
00:19:20,634 --> 00:19:23,042
to return your seat to
its upright position.

385
00:19:23,937 --> 00:19:25,728
What? We're landing?

386
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:29,416
I slept through my first first class?

387
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:33,161
Yes, but you got the most
perfect flying experience

388
00:19:33,163 --> 00:19:34,829
anyone could ever ask for.

389
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:38,073
You didn't even know
you were on a plane.

390
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:39,500
Aw.

391
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:44,747
And then she gave me the best
cookie of my entire life.

392
00:19:44,824 --> 00:19:47,082
Aw, cookie.

393
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,753
After listening to the 14
hours of testimony today,

394
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,422
I propose that Convenience Airways'

395
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,018
radical passenger control
system be approved for use

396
00:19:57,094 --> 00:19:59,520
across the entire airline industry.

397
00:19:59,597 --> 00:20:00,930
- Hear! Hear!
- Yes.

398
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:01,991
I agree.

399
00:20:02,008 --> 00:20:03,508
Well, I say, trap-door them all

400
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,843
and let the FAA sort it out.

401
00:20:05,845 --> 00:20:07,011
Excellent.

402
00:20:07,013 --> 00:20:08,955
- So ordered.
- Wait.

403
00:20:09,106 --> 00:20:12,366
As the one person who was not
trap-doored on this flight,

404
00:20:12,485 --> 00:20:15,405
I believe I have the authority to say

405
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,093
that mass in-flight
incarceration is not the answer.

406
00:20:20,128 --> 00:20:21,784
We need thoughtful solutions

407
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:25,120
to this epidemic of
rudeness and disrespect.

408
00:20:25,198 --> 00:20:27,360
Sure, it's easy to push a button

409
00:20:27,395 --> 00:20:29,625
and drop all your
problems down a trap...

410
00:20:29,627 --> 00:20:31,978
door...!

411
00:20:32,623 --> 00:20:33,888
Ow!

412
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:36,483
Honey, are you hurt?

413
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,316
I'm okay. I landed on my hair.

414
00:20:52,817 --> 00:20:55,451
<i>In our Convenience
Airways in-flight prison,</i>

415
00:20:55,486 --> 00:20:57,486
<i>cigarettes are not accepted as currency.</i>

416
00:20:57,564 --> 00:21:00,823
<i>Preferred method of
payment is sexual favors.</i>

417
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:01,841
<i>Please do not fashion</i>

418
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,173
<i>the courtesy toothbrush into a shiv.</i>

419
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:07,572
<i>Complimentary shivs are
provided upon request.</i>

420
00:21:07,574 --> 00:21:09,682
<i>In the unlikely event
of a water landing,</i>

421
00:21:09,684 --> 00:21:12,852
<i>your cellmate may be used
as a floatation device.</i>

422
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:14,854
<i>Should you tamper with your handcuffs,</i>

423
00:21:14,931 --> 00:21:17,172
<i>you will be ejected from the plane.</i>

424
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,767
<i>Parachutes are available
for purchase on our website.</i>

425
00:21:19,844 --> 00:21:22,603
<i>We know you have no choice
in airplane prisons,</i>

426
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,681
<i>but we appreciate you
being locked up with us.</i>

427
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,494
<i>And don't forget to sign up
for our Frequent Felon Program.</i>

428
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:34,411
Shh!

429
