-Hey.

14
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,591
{\an8}Ah, but Paris would make a très bon site

{\an8}for the next Olympic Games.

16

{\an8}And, uh, why is that?

17
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,131
{\an8}We don't have to explain ourselves

18
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,968
{\an8}to the likes of you.

19
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,473
{\an8}I await your reply.

20
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,015
{\an8}I recommend Moscow

21
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,769
{\an8}where the American dollar
buys seven rubles.

22
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,770

-12 rubles.

23

-60 rubles.

{\an8}-(pager beeping)
-1,000 rubles.

25

{\an8}I must go!

26
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,525
{\an8}-I suggest Motown.
-Detroit?

27
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,149
{\an8}No, no. Mongolia town,
home of the Motown sound.

{\an8}You are all crazy.
The answer is Buenos Aires.

{\an8}People! People, please. You're forgetting

35
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,383
{\an8}what the Olympics are all about.

36
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,788
{\an8}Giving out medals of beautiful gold,

37
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,797
{\an8}so-so silver and shameful bronze.

{\an8}(groaning and muttering)

39
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,795
{\an8}I have here a letter

40
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:17,263
{\an8}from a little girl named Lisa Simpson.

41
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,515
{\an8}She says her town
might not be important enough

42
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,098
{\an8}to host the Olympics,

43
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:25,603
{\an8}but she asks if the torch
could just pass by

44
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,147
{\an8}so she can experience the glow

45
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,401
{\an8}that we feel every day.

46
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:34,243
{\an8}Well, I say we don't bring her the torch.

47
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,570
{\an8}I say we bring her the Olympic Games!

48
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,657
{\an8}Who is with me?

49
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,580
{\an8}Well, I don't care. It's my decision.

50
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,173
{\an8}<i>Springfield was shocked today</i>

51
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,128
{\an8}<i>to learn it will host the next Olympics.</i>

52
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,918
{\an8}<i>Economists predict our city</i>
<i>will experience the same boom</i>

53
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,133
{\an8}<i>that Sarajevo enjoyed</i>
<i>after the 1984 games.</i>

54
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,804
{\an8}And it's all because of your letter, Lisa.

55
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,934
{\an8}Well, actually, I just wrote it
for a school assignment.

56
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,142
{\an8}Everyone else wrote
to the Backstreet Boys.

In fact, we're rooting for you.

68
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,705
Yeah! Go for the gold, Dad!

Just for the prototype, honey.

Knowing you always hate my first idea,

80
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,114
I prepared a backup.

81
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,109
How about a big Olympic hello

82
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:57,451
for Springy, the Springfield spring?

83
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,318

the dog's eyes, are they?

84
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,195
Hey, that's cute.

85
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,452
Good work, Dad.

86
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,203
It's fun for the whole family

87
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,325
and the ends are razor-sharp

88
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,462

I've never seen such a clean sewer.

98
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:54,341
And we are positively inspired
by your solar power plant.

99
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,749
Yes, love that sun, man.

100
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,378

101
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,264
including but not limited to anything

102
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,261
to make your stay here tolerable.

103
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,183
Yes, you'll be completely above the law.

104
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,562
Uh, women, guns, cash...

105
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,929
uh, whatever you need, it's yours.

107
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,113
And that's not all.

108
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,108
We've just chosen
our official Olympic mascot.

00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,986

112
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,822
In your face, Patty and Selma.

113
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,157
Well, we still love you, Ciggy.

114
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,243
SELMA: Yeah.

115
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,249
Mmm... That glue really gives it a pop.

116
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:38,464

are our future,

the next Olympics
will be held right here in--

Wait, wait. We have one more act.

The patriotic comedy stylings
of Bart Simpson.

149

150
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,418
Thank you, thank you.

Too easy.

156
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,342
{\an8}How you doing, Germany?

157
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,256
{\an8}Here's my impression
of an East German woman:

158
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,135
{\an8}Kiss me, or I'll crush you.

00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,892

161
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,438
I'm not thinking that.

162
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,771
Hey, Swiss miss.

163
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,436
There no missing you, babe. (laughs)

164

say one last thing

168
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,736
to our Olympic representatives.

169
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,035
If there was a medal
for horrible audiences,

170
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,329
you'd get the gold.

171
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,462
Peace out.

Skinner!

177
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,679
How could you put this boy on
with that horrible material?

178
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,272
Well, it really did seem
funny in rehearsal.

179
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,598
And he didn't even get
to his Ubangi routine.

180
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,604
(laughing)

181
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,306
Ha, ha, ha. Laugh it up, you punks,

182
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,317
'cause you and Jan Murray here

183
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,689
just cost our town the Olympics.

184
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,196
Hey, Chalmers, where are you from?

185
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,818
I... Oh, well, I was born in Queens,

186
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,406
went to Ball State,

187
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,491
then made the move
to Intercourse, Pennsylvania.

188
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,616
Uh, why do you ask?

189
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,252
Don't worry, sir.

190
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,999
I'll teach these children
respect for their town.

191
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,960
I'm assigning each of you
20 hours of community service.

192
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:21,962
ALL: Oh.

193
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,503
Community service?

194
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,546
No, no!

195
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,589
"Intercourse"?

196
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,171
{\an8}What if we refuse?

197
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,506
{\an8}You won't pass to the next grade.

198
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,642
{\an8}I fail to see the threat.

199
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,509
Skinner! Good idea.

200
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,006
Now, if you'll excuse me,

201
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,977
I'm off to vacation at Lake Titicaca.

202
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,689
Let's see you make a joke
out of that, Mr. Smart Guy.

203
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,533
All right, Martin,
for your community service

204
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,858
you'll be setting up
a midnight basketball program

205
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,704
for inner-city street gangs.

206
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,735
All right, gang, shirts and skins.

207
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:56,736
Let's hustle!

208
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,287
(gunshot)

209
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,831
(tires screeching)

210
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,825
Milhouse, do you like the beach?

211
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,127
Who doesn't?

212
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,290
SEYMOUR: Good.

213
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,554
I want you to pick up
all this medical waste

214
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,221
that's washed up on the shore here.

215
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,393
Ow! I pricked myself.

216
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,061
Well, just keep working.

217
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,599
You'll prick yourself with the antidote

218
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,183
-sooner or later.
-(sighs)

219
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,902
What are you going to do to me?

220
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,070
Bart, not all community service
is gang warfare

221
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,439
and dangerous infection,
and to illustrate that point,

222
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,777
here's where you'll be working.

223
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,162
The fireworks, candy and puppy dog store?

224
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,410
(puppies barking)

225
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,083
No, no, no. Next to it.

226
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,127
Settle a bet, boil or mole?

227
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,749
(groans)

228
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,588
OK, just breathe through your mouth

229
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,347
and don't ask how they're feeling.

230
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,846
(Muzak playing "Zippity Doo Dah")

231
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,524
(both groaning)

232
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,192
{\an8}Oh, man.

233
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,191
(shrieks)

234
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,272
Whoa!

235
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,726
(grunts)

236
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,566
(teeth chattering)

237
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,861
(all talking together)
Oh, aren't you beautiful.

238
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,735
-Let's pull his skin.
-(yelps)

239
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,242
Look at that.

240
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,204
Oh, be a dear and snap
my support hose to my girdle.

241
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,865
(shuddering)

242
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,753
(bell ringing) Two o'clock.
Recreation time.

243
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,671
Phew. Saved by the bell. Whoa.

244
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,380
Where do you think you're going?

245
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,127
(gulps)

246
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,586
Oh, no, Lis. They got you, too?

247
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,085
Got me? What are you talking about?

248
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,967
I've been volunteering here for a year.

249
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,314
MAN: Hello, let's hear some numbers.

250
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,729
I got a nice diagonal going here.

251
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:44,891
B-3.

252
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,397
You sunk my battleship.

253
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,609
(laughing)

254
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,229
G-52.

255
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,396
You sunk my battleship.

256
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,985
(laughing)

257
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,570
Oh, I got a bingo! What do I win?

258
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,736
A banana!

259
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,873
A whole one?

260
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,029
Yep.

261
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,197
That's the prize? A banana?

262
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,946
Their natural mushiness prevents choking

263
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,708
and promotes regularity.

264
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,250
They're not babies, Lisa.

265
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,173
Give them something fun,
like cigars or booze.

266
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,212
We tried giving them eggnog at Christmas

267
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,466
but it led to widespread de-shawling.

268
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,838
Well, that's what they get

269
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,885
for wearing such tight, little shawls.

270
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,009
-Oh!
-(laughs)

271
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,268
OK, four o'clock, nap time.

272
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,309
(all snoring)

273
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,982
You tell them when to sleep?

274
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,690
Shh. Don't wake them.

275
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,270
(vacuum whirring)

276
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,317
While they sleep,

277
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
we suck up excess dirt and crumbs.

278
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,861
Here you go. Make sure you get
into every crevice.

279
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,447
(snoring)

280
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,334
Cool!

281
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,579
Grampa... Homer.

282
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,621
Grampa... Homer.

283
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,955
Don't play with the faces.

284
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,344
(all munching)

285
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,589
So, Bart, how was your first day
of forced volunteerism?

286
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,172
That place sucks.

287
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,587
The nurses don't let Grampa do anything.

288
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,636
They practically chew his food for him.

289
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,100
Lucky stiff.

290
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,849
I'm working my ass off here.

291
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,055
Good steak, honey.

292
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,272
The elderly aren't like you or me, Bart.

293
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,602
They thrive on consistency,
predictability,

294
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,268
and a life with no surprises.

295
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,566
Sounds good to me.

296
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,649
(doorbell ringing)

297
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,744
I'll get it.

298
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,358
(chortling)

299
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,855
Delivery for Homer Simpson.

300
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,277
(grunting)

301
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,333
Mmm. Whoo-hoo!

302
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,370
My springs! They finally came!

303
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,794
But we lost the Olympics to Shelbyville.

304
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,503
Yeah, but I should have no problem

305
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,003
selling a thousand springs.

306
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,674
-To who?
-Idiots.

307
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,625
Ooh, these are fun!

308
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,221
<i>Oh, Rhett.</i>

309
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:44,893
<i>Rhett! Oh, Rhett, where will I go?</i>

310
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,562
<i>What'll I do?</i>

311
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,980
<i>Frankly, my dear, I love you.</i>

312
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,479
<i>Let's remarry.</i>

313
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,559
(seniors applauding)

314
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,476
Oh, what a lovely ending.

315
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,145
That's sweet.

316
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,993
They cut out the best word!

317
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:01,318
Didn't that movie used
to have a war in it?

318
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,195
Come on. Get up! You've been warned.

319
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,540
Picture yourself
on a beautiful sailboat...

320
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,199
(tape playing ocean noises)

321
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,167
Ah, can't you just feel
the sea breeze in your hair?

322
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,714
Or scalps?

323
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,593
Say, I hear a foghorn.

324
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,800
(imitating foghorn) Boooor-ing.

325
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,471
Come on, Bart, we don't want
to overstimulate these people.

326
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,970
They just had pudding.

327
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,512
(ringing doorbell)

328
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,636
Hello, little girl. Is your mommy home?

329
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,484
You'll need to ask her for five dollars

330
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,139
to buy Mr. Bouncy Best-friend!

331
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,148
I know you.

332
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,230
Your little smart-mouthed boy
cost this town the Olympics.

333
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,146
MRS.SKINNER: Yow!

334
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,244
SKINNER: Who is it, mother?

335
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,818
Bart Simpson's father.

336
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,153
Oh, I'll be right down.

337
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,908
(footsteps on stairs)

338
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,949
(grunting in pain)

339
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,827
(continues grunting)

340
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,212
HOMER: Boy, Lenny

341
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:54,458
You sure look hungry. Have some nuts.

342
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:58,382
Hey, thanks. Ow! My eye! Ow! Ow! Ow!

343
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,172
(laughing)

344
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,926
Now, if you want to be the life
of the party like Lenny here,

345
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,218
just place your order

346
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,851
for this hilarious novelty item.

347
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,096
Homer, get out of here.

348
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,271
Boy, Moe, you sure look angry.

349
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,810
Here, have some nuts.

350
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,983
Hey, thanks.

351
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,061
Ow!

352
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,395
God, my eye!

353
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,440
-Get it out! Geez!
-(Lenny moaning)

354
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,364
Ahh! Ow! Ow!

355
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,742
-Don't pull. Don't pull.
-(straining)

356
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,200
I said don't pull. Don't.

357
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,282
Now we're pulling into port.

358
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,197
(gasps) And who's waiting
for us at the dock?

359
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,617
Why, it's all your childhood dogs.

360
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,326
I see Petey and Blackie
and Schnoodle and...

361
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,287
-Oh, no! Pirates!
-Pirates?

362
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,957
Ahoy, mateys, it's me, Long Bart Silver

363
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,086
And I'm going to rip you a new IV hole.

364
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,173
(anxious gasps)

365
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,838
Bart, what are you doing?

366
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,926
I'm just trying
to liven things up around here.

367
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,512
These people need to ride motorcycles

368
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,057
and play rockin' electric guitars

369
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,560
like the old people on TV.

370
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,021
Excuse me, but when those pirates boarded

371
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,812
I swallowed my wedding ring
for safekeeping.

372
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,937
Get me some Ipecac.

373
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,483
I'd like to expunge it.

374
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,816
(groans)

375
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,901
OK, she's gone,

376
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,315
let's break out of here and have some fun.

377
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,823
Should we ask someone...

378
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,655
But if I get up,
somebody'll take my chair.

379
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,741
Got that right.

380
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:10,985
It's the only one left with padding.

381
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,696
ALL (in hushed tones): Padding...

382
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,996
(groans)

383
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,619
What about you, Chief?

384
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,496
Don't you want to be free like the eagle?

385
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,633
Oh, I don't live here.

386
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,629
I'm just dropping off
Indian casino pamphlets.

387
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,132
Vote yes on Prop 217.

388
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,931
-(grunts)
-(glass shattering)

389
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:33,143
You know, the door was open,
Chief Break-everything!

390
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,353
Come on, people!

391
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,734
You don't want to stay in a place

392
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,150
where they vacuum you while you sleep.

393
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,188
They do what now?

394
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,691
Now's our chance. Let's go!

395
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,484
(all chattering excitedly)

396
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,116
Oh, no. Bart has stolen the elderly.

397
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,368
-(glass shattering)
-(exclaims)

398
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,451
Forgot my hat.

{\an8}BART: Hey, everybody

422
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,587
{\an8}How'd you like to go on a real boat trip?

423
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,007
(upbeat chattering)

424
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,215
Hello!

425
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,352
Argh, not a looker among 'em.

426
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,107
Full speed ahead. Damn the torpedoes.

427
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,148
What'd he say? Put on our tuxedos?

428
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,944
I want some taquitos.

429
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,605
HOMER: Welcome to the kitchen

430
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,196
of tomorrow... today!

431
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,492
Marge, how much would you pay

432
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,365
for a self-flipping hamburger pan?

433
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,792
-Nothing.
-Don't answer yet.

434
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,460
Watch how easy it is
to flip hamburgers with the help

435
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,829
of God's greatest creation, the spring!

436
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,126
Now, watch this.

437
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,418
(screaming)

438
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,684
Are you OK?

439
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,314
Some second-degree burns,

440
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,980
but some first-class burgers.

441
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,389
(groans)

442
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,847
I want you to get rid of these springs.

443
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,227
But you haven't seen the baby of tomorrow.

444
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,315
Ta-da!

445
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,397
Now if I drop her, no more tears!

446
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,736
(humming "Sweet Georgia Brown")

447
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,202
Give me my baby.

448
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,742
"D" it up, Marge. I'm going to the hole.

449
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,945
(Marge straining)

450
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,866
MARGE: I want these springs
out of our house today.

451
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,496

00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,925
You're not flushing those springs

455
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,638
down our toilet, are you?

456
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,468
-HOMER: Of course not.

Oh, Abe, you dance divinely.

462
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:33,028
I haven't felt this relaxed and carefree

463
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,862
since I was watch commander
at Pearl Harbor.

464
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,908
Aw, geez, this place used to be
crawling with Russian subs.

465
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,123
Now, there's just four.

466
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,042
BART: Ah! Sea Hag!

467
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,373
Bart Simpson!

468
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,247
(pants) Bart, are you crazy?

469
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,916
You've got to get the old folks home

470
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,514
to the old folks' home.

471
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,759
No way.

472
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,011
They're finally having some fun.

473
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,683
How low can I go?

474
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,812
(bone cracking)

475
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:00,888
That's it.

476
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,603
Gee, Bart, maybe you're right.

477
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,353
-(beeping)
-They don't even seem to care

478
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,234
that it's medication time.

479
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,901
Medication time? Hot dog!

480
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,150
Give me! Give me! Give me!

481
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,731
-I want some pills!
-Blue ones!

482
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,726
(overlapping dialogs)

483
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,027
But I've set you free.

484
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,565
No more nap time, no more bingo.

485
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,744
You can do whatever you want.

486
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,365
Let's play bingo.

487
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,989
Yeah, let's play bingo.

488
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,486
You sunk my battleship.

489
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,708
(laughing)

490
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:25,868
No.

491
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,252
Now, Smithers,

492
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,956
You say you painted
all your Navy buddies this way?

493
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,215
Until I was discharged, sir.

494
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,176
I don't get it, Grampa.

495
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,144
If you guys like all that boring stuff,

496
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,774
why did you follow me out here?

497
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,395
Got to do something till bingo.

498
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,058
(all gasping and screaming)

499
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,686
How could you miss that huge boat

500
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:55,936
coming right at us?

501
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,908
Oh, two glass eyes.

502
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,028
(clinking)

503
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,580
Oh, it's not fair.

504
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,211
I'm not supposed to die now.

505
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,538
I'm supposed to die
in a foolish motorcycle stunt

506
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,834
at the age of 15.

507
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,537
Ha-ha! You're not dead yet,

508
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,047
you pudgy little pisher.

509
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,628
-Jack LaLanne!
-Jack LaLanne!

510
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,843
Don't worry. I'll save you
The Jack LaLanne Way.

511
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,182
Ah!

512
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,104
(all cheering)

513
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,482
(all shouting)

514
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,733
Uh-oh.

515
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,407
-This is all Bart's fault.
-Let's get him.

516
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,159
-I blame him.
-He killed us all.

517
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,661
I want some taquitos.

518
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,332
Leave him alone!

519
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,750
Sure, Bart's responsible for our deaths,

520
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,880
but he gave us the most fun
we had in 20 years.

521
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:55,089
So, before we go to our watery graves,

522
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,090
I think that...

523
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,051
(gurgling sounds)

524
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,631
(all screaming)

525
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,801
(relieved sighing)

526
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:07,427
(screaming)

527
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,766
(sighing)

528
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,401
(screaming)

529
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,398
(sighing)

530
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,859
What the heck's going on?

531
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,321
HOMER'S VOICE (through pipe):
<i>♪ 135 springs to flush down... ♪</i>

532
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,742
<i>♪ 135 springs ♪</i>

533
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,543
Ah, what a shame.
Not a looker in the bunch.

534
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,877
So, you working tomorrow
at the home, Bart?

535
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,552
Well, I finished my community service.

536
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,341
Oh... right.

537
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,296
But I could swing by after school.

538
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,507
I'll bring the limbo stick.

539
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,596
