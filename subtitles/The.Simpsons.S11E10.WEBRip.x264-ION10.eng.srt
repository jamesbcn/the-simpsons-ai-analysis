00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,474
will be there when you get back.

181
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,806
{\an8}No, they won't.

182
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,310
{\an8}We'll all pitch in on the housework.

183
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,852
{\an8}Right, guys? Guys?

184
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:26,147
-(chuckles) Take that.
-(grunts) Hey! Hey!

185
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,942
Sweetie, it's nice that you want to

186
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,395
take charge around the house.

187
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,025
But don't be a hero.

188
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,702
Just make sure your father
eats all his meals over a tarp,

189
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,162
but not the good tarp.

190
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,702
I want you to get married on that someday.

191
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,456
{\an8}Oh, Mom, I've seen what you do
around the house,

192
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,289
{\an8}and I can handle it.

193
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,884
{\an8}Maybe, I can even
make things more efficient.

194
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,340
Oh, really? Well, knock yourself out.

195
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,972
Just don't expect
any miracles from those two.

196
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,379
BART: Got you! Got you!

197
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,507
Good Lord! You're wasting

198
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,554
thousands of dollars

199
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,926
worth of interferon.

200
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,143
And you're "interferon"

201
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,062
with our good time. (chuckles)

202
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,181
(spits)

203
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:03,638
Well, I'll be.

204
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,771
That cured my canker sores.

205
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,895
(yawns)

206
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,531
{\an8}-Morning.
-Dad, where are your clothes?

207
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,663
I don't know.

208
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,451
Don't tell me Mom dresses you.

209
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:21,123
I guess, or one of her friends. (munching)

210
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,962
OK, now, we're going to draw jobs
from the chore hat.

211
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,085
Come on, bikini inspector.

212
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,167
"Scrub toilet." OK, that was a practice.

213
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,219
Practice. Practice.

214
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,675
{\an8}OK, here we go. "Feed fish."

215
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,023
-I'll supervise.
-You know, the reason for the hat--

216
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,098
Oh, it's a great hat.

217
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,683
No one's questioning the hat.

218
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,558
Will you at least do the dishes?

219
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,015
Lisa, I'll do the dishes

220
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,074
when I pick it out of the chore hat,

221
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,688
and it's not a practice.

222
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,243
See? There it is.

223
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,529
But that was a practice.

224
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,822
The system works.

225
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,235
-Come on, eat, you lazy fish.
-(honking)

226
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,576
{\an8}Oh! You're going to be late.

227
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,000
{\an8}Here are your lunches, and no trading
your fruit for firecrackers.

228
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,424
Oh, but Lenny just got
some bottle rockets.

229
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,513
{\an8}You stay away from Lenny.

230
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,918
{\an8}Where's your sweater, Bart?

231
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,336
{\an8}It unraveled on a nail.

232
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,884
That's not true. He left it on the bus.

233
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,547
-You're dead, squealer.
-(grunts) Lisa, help!

234
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,387
Those boys of mine.

235
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,806
Mrs. Simpson! What are you doing?

236
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:29,363
I couldn't sleep knowing
that window had a smudge on it.

237
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,558
You're here to rest.

238
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,818
If you want the window cleaned,

239
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,479
just push the call button.

240
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,527
Oh, I don't want to be a bother.

241
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,861
Wouldn't bother us.
It just turns up your morphine.

242
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,405
Oh, so it does.

243
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,623
Stop pushing that!

244
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,913
Mr. Sakamoto is here for your acupressure.

245
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,156
Now, Mrs. Simpson,

246
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,328
just lie back and relax.

247
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,877
Mr. Sakamoto wants you to be comfortable

248
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,841
while he does his thing.

249
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,380
Oh, I don't think I need any--

250
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:01,426
Ooh... Oh, wow!

251
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,269
OK, guys, dinner's ready!

252
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:10,811
-(footsteps)
-(eating noisily)

253
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,306
{\an8}The cheese isn't quite melted.

254
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,518
{\an8}Let me just pop it back in the...

255
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,027
{\an8}-(growls)
-Here you go.

256
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,315
Hmm. (gasps)

257
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,533
Slivered almonds for the green beans.

258
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,446
I'll be right back.

259
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,406
(clattering)

260
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,368
(loud belch)

261
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,714
(sighs)

262
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,799
{\an8}-So, how was your day?
-(gurgles)

263
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,666
(groans)

264
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,547
(flies buzzing)

265
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,966
Bart, you were supposed to scour the pans.

266
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,143
They need to soak.

267
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,811
{\an8}You said that four days ago.

268
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,770
{\an8}Look! They're rusted through.

269
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,900
-It's an illusion.
-No, it's not.

270
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,648
-I got the groceries.
-Good.

271
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,070
(sniffs) Maple soda?

272
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,609
A cell phone full of candy?

273
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,949
Astronaut bread?

274
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,699
It's the bread of astronauts.

275
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,031
I didn't know Aerosmith made a cereal.

276
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,742
{\an8}Dad, I gave you a list.

277
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:07,787
Oh, yeah.

278
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,830
(chuckles)

279
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,293
You were way off.

280
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,582
(growls)

281
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,325
Hello, lollipop island.

282
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,127
There's a little girl here

283
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,881
who had too many sour balls.

284
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,133
{\an8}-(frustrated sigh)
-Anyway, where were we?

285
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,338
{\an8}Hello? Hello?

286
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,892
They hung up.

287
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,933
(phone rings)

288
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,891
Talk to me.

289
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,524
{\an8}Hey, Mom, how's the leg?

290
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,402
Leg? Oh! Oh, that.

291
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,730
It's pretty great.

292
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,225
How are things at home?

293
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,976
{\an8}Oh, couldn't be better.

294
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,648
{\an8}-Marco.
-BART: Polo.

295
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,066
{\an8}-Marco.
-BART: Polo.

296
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,034
{\an8}(cat mewing scared)

297
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,033
{\an8}-HOMER: Marc...
-(crash)

298
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,874
-BART (chuckles): Polo.
-So, Mom, you think you'll be

299
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,621
getting out of there soon?

300
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,292
I don't know, honey.

301
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,461
I've got a lot of therapy left.

302
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,420
I really thought
I could handle this, but--

303
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,000
I think so, too. Bye.

304
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,455
-(dial tone)
-(groans)

305
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,264
RICKY (on TV): <i>Lucy?</i>

306
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,010
(Lucy crying)

307
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,512
FRED: <i>You hit her pretty hard there, Rick.</i>

308
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,513
(laughing)

309
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,096
(TV sound)

310
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:13,141
(groaning, growling)

311
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,944
{\an8}Will you guys turn that thing down?

312
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,981
Sweetie, if we didn't
turn it down for the cops

313
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,686
what chance do you have?

314
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,566
(Lucy crying on TV)

315
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,863
HOMER (laughs): He hit her again.

316
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:25,907
(grunts)

317
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,290
{\an8}(grumbles, mumbles)

318
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,078
{\an8}LUCY: Losing your marbles, huh, kid?

319
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,201
(shrieks)

320
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:38,002
-Lucy?
-Lucy McGillicuddy Ricardo Carmichael.

321
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,125
(coughs) And I think there's some more.

322
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,712
What are you doing here?

323
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,007
I came from heaven to help you

324
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,130
get revenge on these bums.

325
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,887
Is there an ashtray around here?

326
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,723
-Will this do?
-Thanks, doll.

327
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,015
Now, we need a scheme

328
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,678
to teach those slobs a lesson.

329
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,227
{\an8}You mean like when you hid inside

330
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,351
{\an8}the Congo drum to scare Ricky?

331
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,608
Hey, stay away from the drums.
That's my bit.

332
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,491
(snaps a finger) I got it!
Here's what you do.

333
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,648
Wait until they fall asleep,

334
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,988
then you sneak into their rooms

335
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,413
and make sure
they're fast asleep because...

336
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,624
(snoring)

337
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,166
(soft chuckle)

338
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,471
(snoring)

339
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,677
(Homer screams)

340
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,062
BART: My skin! My beautiful skin!

341
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,849
{\an8}(chuckles)

342
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:38,853
-HOMER: Lisa, help!
-(both grunting, crying)

343
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,568
(whining) What's wrong with us?

344
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,029
{\an8}(gasps) I don't like the looks of this.

345
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,069
You don't? 'cause that's what I said.

346
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,993
-Tell her, Bart.
-Shut up! Shut up!

347
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,662
We better check with a doctor.

348
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,829
<i>Welcome to </i>Virtual Doctor <i>,</i>

349
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,162

{\an8}Let's see.

352
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,919
{\an8}-Crusty sores.
-Yes.

353
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,002
{\an8}Horrible wailing.

354
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,007
Yes... Yes!

355
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,339
{\an8}Any exposure to unsanitary conditions?

356
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,054
{\an8}Duh! We're pigs!

357
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,680
{\an8}OK, and... diagnose.

358
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,765
<i>You've got leprosy.</i>

359
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,178
BOTH: Leprosy!

360
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:21,187
{\an8}-(both scream)
-BOTH: Unclean!

361
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,773
Help us, <i>Virtual Doc </i>!

362
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,146
Look at me, I'm on my knees.

363
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,284
<i>Good-bye.</i>

364
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,609
-(whimpering )
-Excellent.

365
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:37,252
Leprosy? I can't believe it.
That fortune cookie was right.

366
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,159
{\an8}Why would God punish a kid?

367
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,868
{\an8}I mean, an American kid.

368
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,588
Now, guys, leprosy thrives
in filthy conditions.

369
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,760
So your only chance
is to clean up the house.

370
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,089
{\an8}-I'll get you a couple of mops.
-Mops?

371
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,434
The cure sounds worse than the disease.

372
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,390
At Sunday school, they said, the lepers
were cured by some bearded dude.

373
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,141
{\an8}-Jesus?
-Yeah, that sounds right.

374
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,143
{\an8}Oh, I think we're on the outs with him,

375
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,765
{\an8}but I know someone
who's even holier than Jesus.

376
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,983
(doorbell rings)

377
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,440
Hi-diddly-ho, I've-- (grunts)

378
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,494
(both crying)

379
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,359
Maude, come quick!
The Simpsons are covered with cooties!

380
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,777
-Help us!
-We're diseased!

381
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,946
Oh, no! That's leprosy!

382
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,285
Remember those scary lepers in <i>Ben-Hur?</i>

383
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,910
You saw <i>Ben-Hur </i>without me?

384
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,117
We were broken up then.

385
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,496
-Well, that's no--
-(both yell)

386
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,214
BOTH: Brains!

387
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,554
{\an8}Use your brains to help us.

388
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,300
Your delicious brains.

389
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,934
-(Bart groaning)
-Oh, those poor souls.

390
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,140
{\an8}What's the Christian thing to do?

391
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:39,893
Oh, thank you! Thank you, thank you,
you wonderful man!

392
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,935
(kissing)

393
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,729
All right! Food!

394
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,983
-(eating noisily)
-(both crying)

395
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,068
Bart! Leave some for Rod and Todd.

396
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,533
{\an8}Here you go, lad.

397
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,363
{\an8}-MAUDE: Todd, no!
-(sucking sound)

398
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,786
Uh, listen, Homer, we'd love to help you,

399
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,790
but we're not really set up for lepers.

400
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,713
So you're shunning us?

401
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,002
No, no, no, no, no.

402
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,375
I'm just thinking, we could

403
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,671
send you to a better place.

404
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,884
You know, a place where they could

405
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,383
really take care of you.

406
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,545
Oh, thank you, good sir!

407
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,934
-(kisses)
-(groans)

408
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,756
-(sucking sound)
-(sneezes)

409
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,177
Ooh, that smarts.

410
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,135
Boys, get the alcohol-free alcohol.

411
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,726
{\an8}Well, I shall just get this cast off,

412
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,563
{\an8}and you can go home to your--

413
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,478
{\an8}Oh, my Lord!

414
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,486
Well, it <i>has </i>been a week.

415
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,238
Code blue! 1,000 cc's of leg wax, stat!

416
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,703
Lazy, no-good lepers.

417
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,702
Making me clean everything myself.

418
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,914
(phone rings)

419
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,123
<i>MOE: Hey, is Homer there?</i>

420
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,663
No, he isn't.

421
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,916
-I don't know where he is.
-I'm a little worried.

422
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,458
He usually stops in for an eye-opener
on the way to work.

423
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,253
He told us he'd been going to the gym.

424
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,126
(chuckles) Wow!

425
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,053
Anyway, you don't think he could be
at another bar, do you?

426
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,383
Because I couldn't take that.

427
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,047
I-I just couldn't. I--

428
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,216
(sobbing)

429
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,764
<i>Don't hang up on me!</i>

430
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,518
MARGE: I'm home, everybody.

431
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,559
Gee, the house looks great.

432
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,654
{\an8}Mom, I lost Dad and Bart.

433
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,519
Lost them? What do you mean?

434
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,356
I tricked them into thinking
they had leprosy.

435
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,942
Hansen's disease.

436
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,527
You know, like that horrible cream soda?

437
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,073
Well, Dad and Bart ran away,

438
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,277
and no one seems to know where they went.

439
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,987
OK, OK, calm down.

440
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,657
They couldn't have gone too far.

441
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,995
Molokai?

442
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,210
You mean, Hawaii?

443
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,500
Uh-huh. That's the one.

444
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,753
They've got a top-notch

445
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,044
leper colony there,

446
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,497
so we shipped them right off.

447
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,587
(gasps) Ooh, cost us a bundle, too.

448
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,222
I guess we'll have
an imagination Christmas this year.

449
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,590
BOTH: Yay! Imagination Christmas!

450
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,347
I got a Pogo stick!

451
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,679
I got a hula hoop!

452
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,018
(tires screeching)

453
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,188
Here.

454
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,073
Whoa! This is a hospital?

455
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,202
That it is.

456
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,278
We'll take the cure, bag a few lobsters,

457
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,867
then watch some gay guys get married.

458
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,543
Ah, you must be the Simpsons.

459
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,542
Howdy. And thanks for not
recoiling in horror.

460
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,205
Thank you for the friendly "howdy."

461
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,753
{\an8}Do we get a room with a view?

462
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,126
Oh, you'll have a great view
of the whole beach

463
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,724
{\an8}from the electric needle room.

464
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,298
Really? The whole beach?

465
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,473
{\an8}Yes, from the electric needle room.

466
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,638
Electric needle room?

467
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,930

Here they are.

Oh, thank God you're all right.

474
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:52,042
Dad, Bart, I played
a horrible trick on you,

475
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,585
and I'm really sorry.

476
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,999
You don't have leprosy. It's just oatmeal.

477
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:56,958
Yeah, we know.

478
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,377
I figured it out after
I ate one of my chest sores.

479
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,006
Well, then let's get out of here.

480
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,353
No way. We scored
a free Hawaiian vacation.

481
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,258
This place is a blast.

482
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,307
{\an8}All we have to do is endure
two hours of blinding pain.

483
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,142
{\an8}Then, it's nothing
but shopping and surfing.

484
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,438
{\an8}Tonight, we're gonna put
our fake sores back on,

485
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,692
{\an8}then jump the fence at club med
and scare the normals.

486
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,034
Well, it all sounds lovely, but--

487
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,860
