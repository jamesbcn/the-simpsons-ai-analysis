Don't worry.

366
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,817
The blood will hold it
right on your face.

367
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,578
Now some after shave.

368
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,410
Ooh! Ah! Eeh!

369
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,155
(screams)

370
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,957
(groans)

371
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,210
Ah! You son of a--!

372
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,542
And that's how we shave.

373
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,878
Dad, it's all my fault.

374
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,684
I shook up that can of beer.

375
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,468
It was just
an April fool's joke.

376
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,511
(beeping)

377
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,429
(growling)

378
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:13,187
(beeping)

379
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,532
Why, you little--!

380
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,189
Homie, you're all right!

381
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,198
We're a family again!

382
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,950
(Homer growling,
Bart gagging)

383
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,409
This calls
for a celebration.

384
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,617
We're all going
to Hawaii.

385
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,707
(all gasping)

386
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,342
Gotcha!

387
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,459
It's April fool's
for two more minutes.

388
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,456
Dad, it's May 16th.

389
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,548
You were in that coma
for seven weeks.

390
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,263
Uh-huh.

391
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,224
(laughing)

392
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,767
You lost five percent
of your brain.

393
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,065
Me lose brain? Uh-oh.

394
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,029
(laughing)

395
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,621
Why I laugh?
