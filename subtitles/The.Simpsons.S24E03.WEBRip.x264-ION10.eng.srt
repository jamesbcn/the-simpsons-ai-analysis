{\an8}I'll get right on it.

{\an8}Homer, when are you going

{\an8}I'm on it!

{\an8}Are you going to fix the faucet or not?

{\an8}For the third time this year, yes!

{\an8}No one stays in the sinkhole!

{\an8}Lousy surface dwellers.

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,020
{\an8}So, what seems to be the problem?

36
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,863
{\an8}Springfielders are getting
that sinking feeling...

{\an8}(chuckles)

38
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,436
{\an8}...as the dangerous sinkhole
continues to expand.

39
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,277
{\an8}While this sinkhole is larger
than the Sarlacc pit

40
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,373
{\an8}which swallowed Boba Fett,

41
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,738
{\an8}it is smaller than the Geonosis
battle arena

42
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,406
{\an8}where Jango Fett was beheaded
by Mace Windu.

43
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,865
{\an8}Weren't those two places
about the same size?

44
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,036
{\an8}I didn't know this was an ambush!

Hello, ma'am.

91
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,251
Are you and your husband here
to look for a new car?

92
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,250
No, I'm here to buy one myself.

93
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,082
Uh-huh.

94
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:57,007

Sensibla is the car for you.

It's got all the features
that a modern woman wants,

96
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,426
including all manner of makeup mirrors.

97
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:08,059
This car looks a little small.
Is the engine powerful?

98
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,851
Wow, somebody knows her cars.

99
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,608
This baby
comes with an RX-12 2-cylinder.

100
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,360
Well, that's odd, because
the consumer website says

101
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,073
the RX-12 2-cylinder has

102
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,533
a dealer's invoice of $14,700.

103
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:26,123
(chuckles) You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna talk to my manager.

104
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,370
This says you are the manager.

105
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,293
Those websites are taking food
out of my children's mouths.

106
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:34,002
It says on your Facebook page
you have no kids.

107
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:38,053
I have two Yorkies and I'll be talking
about you to them tonight!

108
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,217
I got to hand it to you, Marge.

109
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,799
You got the exact amount
of car for our family.

110
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,305
Room for two adults, three kids
and zero grandpas.

111
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,638
Mm-hmm.

112
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,103
Uh-oh! Do you hear that rattle?

113
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,524
-I don't hear anything.
-Me, neither.

114
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,773
(sniffs) And what's that smell?

115
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,855
I think it's "new car smell."

116
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,900
-Well, I don't like it.
-(tires screech)

119
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,369
(kids cough and groan)

120
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,924
I still smell it!

121
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,748
(starter chugging)

122
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,544
Darn car won't start.

123
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:22,258
Let Automobile Von Bismarck give it a try.

124
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,720
-(engine starts)
-Well...

125
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,141
Hmm. Well, it wouldn't start for me.

126
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,930
I think this car's a lemon!

127
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,563
(groans)

128
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,351
Worst car ever! I can't believe it!

129
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,104
Hmm...

130
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,596
(groans)

131
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,607
MARGE: The wipers wipe backwards,

132
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:42,069
and the defroster lines on the back
window are too close together!

133
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,151
Excuse me!

134
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,525
Sir, the car is fine.

135
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,276
-Can I be straight with you?
-Mm-hmm.

136
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,618
As a mechanic, I'm not totally qualified

137
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,373
to judge mental health...

138
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:57,205
So, you're not totally unqualified.

139
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,171
I think the problem
is in your wife's head.

140
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,843
There's a psychological reason
why she hates this car.

141
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,342
Oh, a reason? What could it be?

142
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,505
I'm sorry, but there's
no diagnostic computer

143
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,184
for the female mind.

144
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,983
Wow, an auto mechanic
who tells the truth.

145
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,688
Mmm!

146
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,228
If you want me to examine
your wife overnight,

147
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,232
I can arrange a loaner.

148
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,944
She's an '83 Yugo.

149
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,284
(Yugoslavian accent)
I don't do laundry or kiss boo-boos!

150
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,950
Uh, no, thanks.

151
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,369
-Marge.
-Mm-hmm?

152
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,539
Do you think maybe there's another
reason you don't like this car?

153
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,198
Um, a...

154
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,827
"feelings" reason?

155
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,543
What are you talking about?

156
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,253
Well, maybe you and the car
got off on the wrong foot.

157
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,054
When do you think things
first went wrong?

158
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,419
All right! I remember we all got in.

159
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,376
And by the way, that backseat
is pretty tight for the kids.

160
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,098
I mean, I don't know what we'd
do if we had another baby.

161
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,640
(gasps)

162
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,693
With this car, we're basically
saying no more babies.

163
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:01,358
No, no, Marge.
I want you to explore your feelings.

164
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,229
Homer, the reason I hate this car is...

165
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,238
I think I want another baby.

166
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,410
An "on purpose" baby?!

167
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,239
I do!

168
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:17,004
<i>Oh, I really wish I had fixed that faucet.</i>

169
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,416
Homie, I want another baby.

170
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,052
What about, you know, "Stinky"?

Maggie's not a baby!

172
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,590
Her soft spot's been skulled over

173
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,263
for the last three months!

174
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:34,432
Being a mom is who I am,
and I'm not done being who I am.

175
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,354
<i>Okay, Homer, don't speak.</i>

176
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,182
<i>If you must make a sound, whistle.</i>

177
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,017

178
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,443

<i>destroy life as we know it...</i>

179
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:47,283

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,200

181
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,818
Whatever you want, sweetie.

182
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,065
Well, take a shower,

183
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,946
'cause we're gonna try it tonight!

184
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,293
<i>All right! "Try it" means sex.</i>

185
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,620
Whoo-hoo!

186
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,834
Homer, why do you take
a three-second pause

187
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,785
before you answer what I say?

188
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,047
Just appreciating...

189
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,050
how lucky...

190
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,683
I am to be...

191
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,640

192
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,890
you.

193
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,102
What a wonderful thought.

194
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,229
(Homer, Marge laughing)

195
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,146
Boxing wizards. Boxing wizards.

196
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,196
What's she up to?

197
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,779
Let's settle this like adults.

198
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,787
Wands down!

199
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,461
Maybe I should go on antipsychotic meds.

200
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,963
Bart! What are you doing in my room?!

201
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,295
Lowering your blinds.

202
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,880
I'd hate for your carpet to fade.

203
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,216
What are you doing Tuesdays
and Thursdays after school?

204
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,925
What do you do Tuesdays
and Thursdays after school?

205
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,476
Write stupid stuff on the chalkboard.

206
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,559
And if you have any ideas,
I'm really running out.

207
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,564
Today's was "mousetraps are
not slippers" or something.

208
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,356
Now, what are you up to?

209
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,190
A gentleman doesn't ask,

210
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,525
and a lady doesn't tell.

211
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,900
Can I use that on the chalkboard?

212
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,106
I guess.

213
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,485
Gentleman doesn't ask, lady doesn't tell.

214
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,743
Now all I need is one for
Martin Luther King Day.

215
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,865
My husband and I have been...

216
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,502
snuggling six ways from Sunday...

217
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,960
And let me tell you,

218
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,670
a towel rack
will not support your weight.

219
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,251
But we aren't making a baby.

220
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,756
I thought we should check
to make sure Homer has...

221
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:34,088
you know,
working stuntmen in his cannon.

222
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,755
You were wise to check, Marge.

223
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,013
What do you mean?

224
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,894

225
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,011

00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,595
HOMER: Ooh...

00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,080
Lisa's going somewhere

348
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,019
Room for one, please.

349
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,437
(squeaking noise)

350
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,536
Honey, I'm sorry.

351
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,714
It's just that we have a hard enough time
handling three kids.

352
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,264
Emotionally, financially, the boy...

353
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,838
I just didn't know how to tell you.

354
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,473
Just yell across the house
like you do everything else.

355
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,431
Okay, good, we're talking.

356
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,801
-We're not talking!
-(phone rings)

357
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,057
Your phone just dialed me.

358
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,969
You were pocket-dialed!

359
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,517
Hey, the pocket wants what it wants.

360
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,560
Oh...

361
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,071
They just leave the maple
syrup on the table, huh?

362
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,979
How about that? That's trust, huh?

363
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,147
Shush!

364
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,645
MAN:
Now, kids, help your brother Xander.

365
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,322
<i>There he is.</i>

366
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,737
<i>The fat, pathetic slob</i>
<i>I'd be with four kids.</i>

367
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,995
Where's Daddy? Where'd Daddy go?

368
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,502
-Here he is!
-(laughing)

369
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,165
<i>Oh, right.</i>

370
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,173
<i>That dad was there all along.</i>

371
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,335
<i>Whew! That was so sweet.</i>

372
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,344
<i>Maybe there's no such thing</i>
<i>as too many kids.</i>

373
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,967
<i>MARGE:</i>
<i>I know what Homer's thinking.</i>

374
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,104
<i>He's thinking that he</i>
<i>really wants a baby now.</i>

375
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,812
<i>So this should be the time, ironically,</i>

376
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,693
<i>that I'll change my mind</i>
<i>and not want one.</i>

377
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,021
<i>Well, no way!</i>
<i>I want one more than ever!</i>

378
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,566
(grunts)

379
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,358
Uh-oh. I...

380
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,244
I don't think I rewound
the video the last time I was here.

381
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,622
Um, I'd like to get back a donation

382
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:59,369
made 15 years ago
by a Simpson, Homer.

383
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,713
Or it may be under
the name Thad Supersperm.

384
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,591
Homer... Homer, this is the point

385
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,878
where I really have to know
what you want.

386
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,672
I'll tell you what I want, Marge.

387
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,376
I want to make another Simpson.

388
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,086
The table with four legs

389
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,386
is sturdier than the table with three.

390
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,930
Cubes are made of cheese,
but pyramids are schemes.

391
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,675
And anything that's half you

392
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,687
is guaranteed 50% perfect.

393
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,110
Oh...

394
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,898
Nice speech, but the last of your sample

395
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,782
was just selected by another couple.

396
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,399
Are you sure there isn't more?

397
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,946
I mean, there's always
a little ketchup left in the bottle.

398
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,490
I'm afraid not.

399
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,703
But the couple is waiting
in the room there.

400
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,704
Maybe you can talk them
into something else.

401
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,874
-(Homer clears throat)
-(screams)

402
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,037
I'd like to buy back my sample.

403
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,836
Are you saying...

404
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,709
our sample came from you?

405
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,126
Here, it's yours. We don't need it.

406
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,884
Well, I expected a little argument.

407
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,876
No, no, no, look in the mirror--
that's your argument.

408
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,638
Geez. I mean, I'm no Luis Guzman,
but I'm all right.

409
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,150
(gasps) Homer?

410
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,569
How many samples did you sell?

411
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,978
Uh...

412
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,816
remember that Corvette I had?

413
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,201
I thought they only paid $50 a trip.

414
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,449
Exactly.

415
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,700
Well, we're all set.

416
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,371
Let's make a Thad Supersperm Jr.

417
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,660
With a name like that,
he could be president.

418
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,374
Homie, maybe we should wait.

419
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,584
Wha...?

420
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,254
Maybe there's enough Homer
in the world for now.

421
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,303
Yeah. But I was really looking
forward to...

422
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,174
Oh... oh, boy. Uh...

423
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,717
You're right, Marge.

424
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,050
I don't want to bring more kids
into a world full of my kids.

425
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,507
Yah!

426
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,806
Two adults, please.

427
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,194
Enjoy the film, you two.

428
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,609
(laughing)

429
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:57,282
Another thing that would
be harder with four kids.

430
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,322
You know, I always send
the theater manager

431
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,906
a check the next day.

432
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,621
D'oh!

433
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,661
♪♪

434
