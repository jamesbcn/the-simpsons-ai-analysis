1
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,249
D'oh!

2
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:17,544
Stupid shopping list,
turning food into work.

3
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:20,959
Bart!
- Look at me! I'm doing something!

4
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:23,683
You better settle down, boy,

5
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:26,886
or I'll drag you into the blind spot
of that security camera...

6
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,918
...and beat you with one
of those big thick...

7
00:01:30,018 --> 00:01:32,625
...women's magazines
with all the ads in it.

8
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,662
Mr. Homer, why don't you
forget your worries with this,

9
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,264
the last lottery ticket on the roll.

10
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:41,267
They say the last one is lucky
unlike all the others.

11
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:43,631
Lucky, or not.

12
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,007
You make a good case. I'll take it!

13
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,487
Dad! Look at me! Look at me!

14
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,876
Cannonball!

15
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:58,581
I'll take that last lottery ticket, Apu.

16
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,489
Again!

17
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,025
LENNY: I won! I won!

18
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,541
$50,000! Ponder this, Homer.

19
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,666
This ticket would've been yours
if your kid hadn't been screwing around!

20
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:17,704
That is true. Another ironic
tale of the Kwik-E-Mart.

21
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:24,167
You just cost me $200,000!

22
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:29,216
I thought it was 50.
- I was gonna bet it on the dogs!

23
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:34,272
All the groceries seem to have been
balled up in anger.

24
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,225
That kid has become
a Dennis-level menace!

25
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,556
Now, Homer, boys will be boys.

26
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:45,789
Bart cost us $50,000!

27
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,143
I'm going to Moe's.

28
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,749
ALL: Lenny! Lenny! He's our guy!

29
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,569
Got the ticket Homer didn't buy!

30
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,189
Cheer up, Homer.
The drinks are on Lenny.

31
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,492
I don't want your pity booze.
I'll pay for it myself.

32
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,861
I gotta check with Lenny on that.
Is that all right, Lenny?

33
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,764
Nope! Lucky Lenny's buying
all the drinks tonight!

34
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:22,635
Sorry, Homer. But here's a compromise.
Why don't you both pay for the drink?

35
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,735
And tip.

36
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,208
I just want to tell you all
that even before I won this money,

37
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,611
I was the luckiest guy in the world
because I've got friends like you.

38
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,912
ALL: Aww.

39
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:35,748
That's why I'm spending my remaining
scratcher winnings...

40
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,284
...on a kick-ass party for all my friends!

41
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,894
Where's Bart? We're gonna be late
for Lenny's party.

42
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,500
BART: Don't waste your shot, Bart.

43
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,503
You've got just enough cat pee
to soak two dorks.

44
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,480
Bart Simpson!
Did you just spray water on me?

45
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,479
It was water this morning.

46
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,684
Dang that Bart! Thanks to him,
I have to wear my backup dress,

47
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:15,522
which makes my arms look fat.
- You look great!

48
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:16,589
Ha-ha!

49
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,729
You feel self-conscious!

50
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,729
Why can't our son just behave?

51
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:28,635
Well, Marge, you did have that one sip
of alcohol while you were pregnant.

52
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,900
I now christen this ship,
the USS Float and Shoot.

53
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:44,115
Ay, caramba! Ay, caramba!

54
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,820
That was unforgivable.

55
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,192
But I'm beginning to think that Bart's
bad behavior is more than just a phase.

56
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,094
Mom! Bart's flicking boogers on me!

57
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:59,866
They're not boogers! They're clumps
of rubber cement that I stored in my nose.

58
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,966
Oh!

59
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:10,442
Stop it, both of you! Don't make me
drive into that tree! You know I will!

60
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:17,549
No flicking boogers!
And no driving into trees!

61
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,650
BOTH: Yes, ma'am.

62
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,159
Wow, Lenny went all out.

63
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:34,033
ANNOUNCER: In the beginning,
there was darkness. So God created man.

64
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:38,832
But man was alone.
God created the animals and birds.

65
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,868
But man was still Ionely.

66
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:48,173
So God said, let there be friends!

67
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,079
Thank you for being a friend

68
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,159
Travel down the road and back again

69
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:58,622
Your heart is true
You're a pal and a confidant

70
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:04,763
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend

71
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,778
Thank you for being a friend

72
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,503
Thank you for letting me take home
the centerpiece!

73
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:14,003
These are going right on my mom's grave!

74
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,921
Thank you for being a friend

75
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:24,117
Lenny, it was pretty cool of you to spend
your lotto winnings on your pals.

76
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,386
It was worth it so everyone
could have a wonderful evening...

77
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,354
...and go home with a gift bag.

78
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,454
Hmm.

79
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,992
A vacuuming robot?

80
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:44,070
Now before you all leave, I know everyone
hates vacuuming and loves robots!

81
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:15,868
These innocent robots
couldn't have done this on their own.

82
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,304
Someone would've had
to turn them all on at once...

83
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:23,164
...and imbue them with some kind
of malevolent sentience.

84
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,345
Yep, there it is.

85
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,814
Well, whoever did this must be long
gone by now, Chief.

86
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,616
I don't know how we'll ever catch him.

87
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,716
Kill, kill, kill!

88
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,423
Hold it right there, Bart. Can you tell us
anything about who did this?

89
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,988
VAC-U-BOT: Bart make bot bad.

90
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,165
I can explain.
- Kill the child!

91
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,806
Bart, I've had it with you!
I'm taking away all your TV privileges.

92
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:56,376
You already did that.
- Okay, then video games.

93
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,679
That, too.
- No more non-dice board games!

94
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,915
What? You can't take my Balderdash!
- I just did!

95
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:09,869
I don't mean to be bad.
I don't know why I do the things I do.

96
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,331
No one understands me.
I wish I had a different family.

97
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,406
SIMON: I feel exactly the same way.

98
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,467
Oh, my God.

99
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,005
You look like a dorky version of me!

100
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:29,342
And you look like
a dimwitted version of me!

101
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,311
And you two
are 10-year-old versions of me.

102
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,747
The three of us could create
quite a lot of mischief.

103
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,351
But I have to fly back to New York.
That's where my wife and I live.

104
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:42,531
That's her.
You want to see pictures of our kids?

105
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:48,027
My name is Simon Woosterfield.
- Woosterfield?

106
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,696
Your family owns this place.
And Woosterfield Arena.

107
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:53,266
Bonnie Raitt played there.
You guys must be loaded!

108
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,936
Yes. You know,
but the funny thing about being rich...

109
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:01,908
...is sometimes you wake up feeling...
- Terrific? Incredible? Happy as a clown?

110
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,676
Yeah. I'm living the dream.

111
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,316
Wouldn't it be hilarious
if we switched places...

112
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,286
...and lived each other's
lives for a while?

113
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,255
I don't know. I'm pretty attached
to my family. And...

114
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:20,693
HOMER: Get out here, boy! I want to punish
you before I get drunk and merciful!

115
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:21,761
Deal!

116
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,430
My father's name is Homer.
My mother's name is Mom.

117
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,599
My sister's name is Lisa
but everyone calls her Loser.

118
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,135
My butler's name is Chester.

119
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,204
I have a brother named Devon
and a sister named Quenley.

120
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,206
And my horse is called Shadowfax.

121
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,842
You can't miss him.
He's the only Lipizzaner in our stable.

122
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,942
Lipizzaner, got it.

123
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,258
There you are, Master Simon.

124
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:46,452
Thank you, Lipizzaner.
- As you say, sir. Watch your head.

125
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,254
BART: Ow.

126
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,227
You ruin everything!

127
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,263
Driver, laugh at those people for me.
- My pleasure, sir.

128
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:11,937
McMansion, McMansion, McMansion,
McDonald's?

129
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,547
McDreamy.

130
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,449
McSteamy.

131
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:20,815
McMansion, Fleetwood Mac
and Macaulay Culkin!

132
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:29,295
And this is your home, sir.
But of course you already knew that.

133
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,830
BART: Awesome.

134
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,098
Awesome!

135
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,198
Awesome!

136
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,936
This is my bedroom?

137
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,039
A candy corn volcano?

138
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,676
A ceiling from Saddam's palace?

139
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,574
Ooh! And a racecar bed! That really races!

140
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,487
Wow. Cool poster of Joe Montana.
- It's not a poster.

141
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,656
I'm the real deal.

142
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,760
And every day I stand here, the family
donates a million dollars to Notre Dame.

143
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,862
Did you know the words
'Notre Dame' are French...

144
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,597
...but the team is the Fighting Irish?

145
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,399
That's the kind of thing
I think about in here.

146
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,644
Back in the poster, Gabby.
- Yes, sir.

147
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,708
Milhouse, it's me.
Check out the caller ID on your phone.

148
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:19,608
Blocked number?
That service is 3.65 a month!

149
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,882
Did you switch places
with a millionaire kid...

150
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,483
...who looks just like you?

151
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,473
Just sit tight. I'm sending a car.

152
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,860
Why are these noodles orange?

153
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,197
I made it with Cheetos,
just like you like it.

154
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:41,267
If the sauce is too thick,
I can add more root beer.

155
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:46,467
Maybe I'm just not hungry.
- Human garbage can to the rescue!

156
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:51,510
So at work today, we got a memo
saying everyone's getting new chairs.

157
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,213
Father, could you...
- Talk louder? You bet!

158
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:57,950
Naturally I threw my old chair
in the Dumpster right away!

159
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,087
But then Lenny said,
'No. That was the new chair.

160
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,957
'That memo was two months old.'
So now I'm sitting on an orange crate.

161
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,927
I never felt so...
- Will you stop spitting food on me?

162
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,028
Huh?

163
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,064
Keep your meal in your mouth,
you semi-literate spew monkey!

164
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:16,414
That's it, boy!
You're going to bed without supper!

165
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,873
That was an odd thing for Bart to say.

166
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:24,276
Maybe he's going through certain changes.

167
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,713
If that boy thinks I'm paying
to put him through four years of puberty,

168
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:28,781
forget it!

169
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:32,281
Stupid kids, think I'm made of hormones.

170
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,362
Mister La-Di-Da, uppity...

171
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:40,092
This is the greatest great hall
I've ever eaten in, Bart.

172
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,293
CHESTER: Huh?

173
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,162
I mean, Simon.

174
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,262
Oh.

175
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,969
This must be my half-brother
and half-sister!

176
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:54,165
They're beautiful. I mean, just the girl.

177
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,275
I didn't notice the beautiful boy.

178
00:12:56,375 --> 00:13:00,246
So I said, 'Dad, I wanted a Range Rover,
not a Land Rover.'

179
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,915
This is the worst
Martin Luther King Day ever!

180
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:07,095
Well, well, if it isn't our
halfwit half-brother.

181
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,692
Ow.

182
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,960
The old hot spoon! But why?

183
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,064
Because you're our half-brother,
you're blocking our full inheritance,

184
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:21,133
and we hate you.
- Now I get it.

185
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,235
QUENLEY: Hmm!

186
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,238
Bart, I have a crush on your new sister.

187
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,807
You had a crush on my old sister!

188
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,137
Yeah. But that was never gonna happen.

189
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:37,817
Give me back my newspaper!
- MARGE: Homer, it's not a real paper!

190
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,719
It's a rubber chew toy!

191
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,589
For your information, the Daily Growl
is the only newspaper...

192
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,726
...that's not afraid to say
how great this country is!

193
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:51,597
How's the war going? We're winning?
That's great! And our standing abroad?

194
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,798
Fantastic.

195
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,072
This place is insane.

196
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,141
Tonight I got sent to bed without dinner!

197
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,977
Yeah. Well, what's up
with your brother and sister?

198
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:10,416
They're jealous because my father left
their mother to be with my mother, to...

199
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,184
You lost me. Well, gotta go.

200
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,520
Enjoy the upper lower middle class.

201
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,992
Bart, honey?
I saw you didn't like your dinner.

202
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:23,629
So I thought you might like
pepperoni pizza with the crusts cut off.

203
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:27,199
Now let me tuck you in, fluff your pillow,

204
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:31,237
and sprinkle a little fairy dust
to keep the monsters away.

205
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,337
It's cinnamon.

206
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,264
Nighty-night, sweetheart.

207
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,135
I could get used to this.

208
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:46,953
Fancy party. This is like a rap video
before the rappers show up.

209
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:52,224
Simon, have you ever seen
the family mausoleum?

210
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,260
All the Woosterfields will be buried here.

211
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,264
Do you know that after 100 years,
dead bodies turn to red licorice?

212
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,364
Whoa! Let me at it!

213
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:08,574
BART: Help! Let me out! I have my
doubts about this licorice!

214
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,846
Mr. Burns, I'm really sorry.
- Nonsense, Young Woosterfield.

215
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:17,917
Your fortune is greater than mine.
It is I who am at your service.

216
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,822
Smithers, fetch us some lemonade!

217
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,561
All they had was Sunnytime Pink.
- Premix? I beg your forgiveness, lad.

218
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,551
Smithers, pour it down your pants!

219
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,602
Now squish about in those pants,
rewetting every hour!

220
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,639
Come with me.

221
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:47,346
You know, Master Simon, I too was once
the youngest in a wealthy family.

222
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,515
You were once the youngest of something?

223
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:54,220
But fortune ended up smiling on me
while snuffing the life from my siblings.

224
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,355
My older brother was trampled by a horse.

225
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:00,059
My sister died of a poisoned potato.
My twin was shot. That girl was stabbed.

226
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,995
He ate another poisoned potato.
Spontaneous combustion.

227
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:06,565
Fell down a well, potato, potato,
and impaled on the Chrysler Building.

228
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,929
Wow. Only you survived.

229
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:12,338
Which means
the entire fortune went to you!

230
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:16,041
Yes. Funny, that. A word of caution,
Young Woosterfield.

231
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:20,012
Watch out for those closest to you.
- Devon and Quenley?

232
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,248
You don't know when they'll strike.
A boating accident,

233
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,516
a mishap during a ski trip.

234
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:28,020
But rest assured, one way or another,
they will do you in.

235
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,851
Oh, my God. Simon set me up.

236
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,059
And all this time
I thought he wanted the life...

237
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,262
...of a stranger he met in the bathroom.

238
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,765
Now, would you care to continue
this conversation on the teeter-totter?

239
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,569
Why won't you come down?

240
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:48,344
I told you. I only weigh as much
as my clothes and keys.

241
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,012
Hmm.

242
00:16:56,342 --> 00:16:59,779
So I looked down the barrel
of my Winchester rifle,

243
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:03,789
I pulled the trigger,
and I shot that buffalo!

244
00:17:04,384 --> 00:17:07,945
You shot a buffalo?
- You were listening?

245
00:17:08,054 --> 00:17:09,022
Oh.

246
00:17:09,122 --> 00:17:12,725
That means I gotta come up
with an ending for this nonsense!

247
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:16,763
Bart, what are you doing?
- Politely listening to our grandfather.

248
00:17:16,863 --> 00:17:17,864
Huh.

249
00:17:17,964 --> 00:17:22,068
It was the war to end all wars.
But Pepsi would not give up.

250
00:17:22,168 --> 00:17:24,771
They continued to challenge Coke!

251
00:17:25,972 --> 00:17:27,073
Okay, listen, you.

252
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:28,535
I don't know who you are or...

253
00:17:28,635 --> 00:17:30,610
...what you've done with
the real Bart, but...

254
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,580
Well, God help me, I want him back.

255
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,649
I don't know what you're talking about.

256
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:40,119
The real Bart would've thrown me out
the window!

257
00:17:40,219 --> 00:17:42,100
He would have defenestrated you?

258
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,624
You're just digging yourself even deeper.

259
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:47,861
Come on, Bart. You gotta get out of here.

260
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:53,166
Pack like you've never packed before.
You know, I have never packed before.

261
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:55,969
This is hard.

262
00:17:56,069 --> 00:17:58,438
So you're packing.
You must've already heard.

263
00:17:58,538 --> 00:18:00,907
Heard what?
- We're going to Aspen.

264
00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:02,542
On a little ski trip.

265
00:18:02,642 --> 00:18:05,912
Ski trip?
- You won't know how they'll strike.

266
00:18:06,012 --> 00:18:08,515
A boating accident, a ski trip.

267
00:18:10,183 --> 00:18:16,349
Scrubbing you is easy
'cause you've been pre-rinsed

268
00:18:16,723 --> 00:18:23,492
And when you're covered with goo
that's when I'm scrubbing you

269
00:18:23,963 --> 00:18:27,228
Scrub-ub-ub-ub-ub Scrub-ub-ub-ub-ub

270
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:30,763
Mom, 'Bart' has something to tell you.

271
00:18:31,137 --> 00:18:33,773
I don't like the look of those air quotes.

272
00:18:33,873 --> 00:18:37,744
So now Bart is on his way to Aspen
where they're going to try to kill him.

273
00:18:37,844 --> 00:18:43,454
Thank you, Future Bart, for traveling back
through time to warn us.

274
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:54,961
Boy, Aspen sure is ritzy.
Even the winos look better.

275
00:18:55,061 --> 00:18:58,519
We are champagnos.
Who wants a mimosa?

276
00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:01,000
Uh...

277
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,636
This trail is for experienced skiers.

278
00:19:03,736 --> 00:19:05,905
Which is what you'll be
if you make it to the bottom.

279
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:07,707
Which you won't.

280
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:13,546
Soon he'll be dead.
- And we'll split the inheritance.

281
00:19:13,646 --> 00:19:15,481
Yes, split.

282
00:19:15,581 --> 00:19:17,581
Potato?

283
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:21,087
There's Bart!

284
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:26,032
This looks like a job for Captain Crazy!
Up, up, and away!

285
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:29,429
Come on, gravity. You used to be cool.

286
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:31,130
D'oh!

287
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:36,033
Occupied.

288
00:19:49,749 --> 00:19:52,183
Two hot chocolates, please.

289
00:19:53,086 --> 00:19:55,891
Are you guests at the lodge?
- No.

290
00:20:01,494 --> 00:20:07,433
You know, I feel sorry for you, kid,
going back to that cold, loveless family.

291
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:09,135
I'll survive.

292
00:20:09,235 --> 00:20:15,185
Your favorite, sir. Hot fudge sundae
with gold leaf and diamond flakes.

293
00:20:17,343 --> 00:20:19,712
Take me with you!
I'll be anything and everything you want!

294
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:22,906
Don't leave me here with them!

295
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:26,519
I never thought I'd say this,
but I missed you guys.

296
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:28,087
Even what's-her-name... Lisa.

297
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:35,395
Now we tuck in the tummy, the tushy,
and the tootsies.

298
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:45,035
This is the life.

299
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,590
English - US - SDH
