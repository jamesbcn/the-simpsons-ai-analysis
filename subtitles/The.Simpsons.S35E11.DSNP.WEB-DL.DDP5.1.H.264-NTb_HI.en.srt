00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,885
You can't be trusted
with picking Baylor over Gonzaga.

171
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,887
[sighs] All right, I'll do that too.

172
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,223
[crow squawks]

173
00:07:54,224 --> 00:08:00,061
All right, Simpson, this is the 691st time
you've left us for another job.

174
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,981
Yeah. Well, I have a good feeling
about this time.

175
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,524
So, we finally said, "What the hell?"

176
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,068
We have a form for everything
else around here, so why not this?

177
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,696
{\an8}First, how long do you think
you'll be gone?

178
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,865
As always, forever.

179
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,034
"Forever."

180
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,328
Mm-hmm.

181
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,120
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

182
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,622
Hmm. Mmm.

183
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,248
And finally in this instance,

184
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,210
where would you like everyone here
to take this job and shove it?

185
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,795
I'll let you pick.

186
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,130
[Smithers grunts]

187
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,175
Now, all that's left is, uh,
for you to storm out dramatically.

188
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,843
[shouts] Don't tell me what to do!

189
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,929
I quit!

190
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,471
[sighs]

191
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,015
So, you need me to tell you what to do.

192
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,935
But there's no way I can be
with you at the new job.

193
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,895
So, I have engineered this.

194
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,313
Just get it out here.

195
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,566
This is the "Ear-a-no De Frink-a-talk."
[chuckles]

196
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,651
I named it myself.

197
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,654
You see, it transmits my voice
right into your ear.

198
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:56,201
So you can repeat my words like a parrot,
or a macaw or even my pet budgie.

199
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,786
I'm in a cage, Professor.

200
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,539
And even I have more fun than you.
[squawks]

201
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,250
Wait a minute.
Weren't there two birds in that cage?

202
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,629
[coughs] I'm a cannibal. [squawks]

203
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:13,385
We Finns believe
the best employee is a rested employee.

204
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:18,473
Now, it takes months before an employee
is comfortable sleeping at work.

205
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,183
We... Well, look at you.

206
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,726
[Homer snoring] Huh?

207
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,186
What? Occupied.

208
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,689
There's that American can-sleep spirit.

209
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,359
Now, let me show you the employee canteen.

210
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,905
Oh, geez. I can't afford this.

211
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,240
No, it's all free.

212
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,034
Free? Who are you people?

213
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:41,162
Well, in Finland,
we're not only experts on nuclear power,

214
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,706
but for six years in a row,

215
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,083
we've been
the happiest people in the world.

216
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,334
Makes sense.

217
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,378
You live so close to Santa Claus.

218
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:53,133
Actually, our happiness is a combination
of <i>Jante,</i> low expectations,

219
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,884
<i>sisu</i>, determination.

220
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:55,969
<i>Sisu</i>?

221
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,262
And <i>kalsarikännit</i>.

222
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,346
Which is?

223
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,099
Drinking at home in your underwear.

224
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,434
Hmm.

225
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,812
Oh, my God.
I was <i>kalsarikännit</i> before it was cool.

226
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:09,357
Holidays, Sundays,
football Mondays, phone-it-in Fridays.

227
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,692
Magnificent.

228
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,779
We also offer free day care,
bottomless hot chocolate

229
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,699
and a roving squad of surprise masseuses.

230
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,783
Oh! Oh!

231
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:22,370
Oh, is there anything Vikings can't do?

232
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,914
Win the Super Bowl.

233
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,791
And this is where you'll be working.

234
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,919
You remember Dr. Spivak, don't you?

235
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,463
They hired me as your assistant.

236
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,799
Hey, you're the lady who thought
she was gonna get the job.

237
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,051
No hard feelings?

238
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,303
Well, certainly not to your face.

239
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,598
Hmm. I'm sensing something
beneath that remark.

240
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,559
Nothing I'll share with you,
until it's too late.

241
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,813
That's cool. You'd be surprised how many
people talk to me in that tone of voice.

242
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,898
I'm sure I would.

243
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,151
Is it just me,
or are we getting along great?

244
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,654
[humming]

245
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,865
[humming]

246
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,408
How was your first day?

247
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:05,580
Marge, I tell you, for the first time
in my career, I feel like I've made it.

248
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,875
There was nothing you couldn't handle?

249
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,127
There was nothing you couldn't handle.

250
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,047
There was nothing I couldn't handle.

251
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,800
Mmm, I like the way you think
before you answer.

252
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,718
Did you say "Frink" before I answer?

253
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,220
Now, why would you "Frink" that?

254
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,680
That's an odd way to put it,

255
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,475
but I'll ignore it
because we finally have day care!

256
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:29,104
I can take a bath for as long as I want
in the middle of the day.

257
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:33,316
I can floss once,
then throw it away like a movie star.

258
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,820
We can afford extra-virgin olive oil.

259
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,864
Maggie, I brought some food home
from work.

260
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:43,703
They're meatballs,
although they call them reindeer balls.

261
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,204
Homer, this is it.

262
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,332
We're moving to the upper-middle class.

263
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,752
We might be able to pay bills
on the second notice.

264
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,213
[gasps]

265
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,717
So I was thinking we should review
aseismic measures. What do you say?

266
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:03,138
Uh, I believe we should begin
with analysis via computational models.

267
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,891
Interesting. You alternate between
grasping for basic English

268
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,810
and incredibly complex answers.

269
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,062
You're like an idiot that ate a genius.

270
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,566
Are you insulting my brains
or complimenting my appetite?

271
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,026
[chuckles] Clever.
Are you using a chatbot?

272
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,654
Yes, but only for dirty limericks.

273
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,781
"There once was a nerd from Caltech

274
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,159
whose dating life was quite a wreck."

275
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,789
[mumbling, laughing]

276
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,586
Oh, that's dirty. [laughs]

277
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,920
I love this new job.

278
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,090
People were looking at me with, um,
what's that word?

279
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,176
Respect, lard butt.

280
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,802
I'm happy for you too, Dad.

281
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:46,890
But I'm curious how you're doing so well
at this job when, you know...

282
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,350
Let's focus on the positives.

283
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,604
I had time for three baths today.

284
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:57,234
Well, if I can't say how I feel,
I'll just go to my room and sing a lament.

285
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:01,905

296
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,037
Marge, being sad makes her happy.

297
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,998
Thank you both for...
[chuckles] ...answering my email.

298
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,501
It's always a pleasure
to meet nuclear colleagues.

299
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,002
Thanks for inviting us.

300
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,256
Where's Homer? I was gonna say hi
or maybe some other such greeting.

301
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:07,096
First, could you tell me how was
Homer's performance at his last job?

302
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,140
{\an8}Have some whiskey.

303
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:14,602
{\an8}[gulps, smacks lips] Well,
he was consistent.

304
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,231
Lady, I'm not here to bad-mouth
Homer Simpson.

305
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,735
[slurred] Okay. To be fair,

306
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,280
if they didn't want him to sleep at work,

307
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,616
then they shouldn't have given reactors
that soothing hum.

308
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,369
Well, if you were to give him
a letter grade from A to...

309
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,705
F! No, Z.

310
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,541
You know, we're gonna need
a bigger alphabet.

311
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,713
Oh, did we mention the dome
Homer put over the town?

312
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,549
Oh, that was a Tuesday.

313
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:55,184
Oh, Homer, do you happen to remember
the atomic mass of uranium?

314
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:59,480
[Frink] <i>Oh, that's frightfully easy.
That's 238.02891 u.</i>

315
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,565
I don't know who you are,

316
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,901
but your cheating enabled
this doughnut-eating day-drunk

317
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,736
to steal a job he can't do.

318
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,362
Shame. Shame!

319
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,740
Oh, dear God. I... I've crossed a line.

320
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,034
I've become a mad scientist.

321
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:15,205
I, uh... I think you crossed that line
a while ago.

322
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,043
Hey, Flanders.

323
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,128
[sputters] You said hello to me.

324
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,213
Why the upside-down frown?

325
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:28,552
[chuckles] It's funny the people
you say hi to when your life is perfect.

326
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,013
Look, Homer. I'm through.
From now on, just think for yourself.

327
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,099
Okay. My first thought is, never!

328
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,186
You made me the me
I was meant to be, which is you.

329
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,189
Now, get back in my brain
where you belong.

330
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,107
You cannot tell me what to do.

331
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,525
Yes, I can.

332
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,487
As long as you tell me how to say it.

333
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,822
Come on. Tell me how to say it.

334
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,908
[Ned] I hear raised voices.

335
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,369
How about we raise
a glass of lemonade instead?

336
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,828
Oh, shut up, Flanders.

337
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,330
Ooh, that's good. I like that.

338
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,582
