Let me just say this
about that.

00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,304
Okay, Mr. President.

It might be nice to talk
to a grownup for a change.

81
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,817
Well, this party is certainly
a break in my routine.

82
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,945
You know, normally
I spend my Saturdays

83
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,242
carefully laying out my clothes
for the following week.

84
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,866
Then I stroll down to the car wash
to see if Gus is there.

85
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,794
Oh, yeah. You've got
to keep busy.

86
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,543
I collect matchbooks
from glamorous nightclubs.

87
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,996
It's amazing.

88
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,705

Is this...

90
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,007
How you imagined
your life, Edna?

91
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:42,563
Well, yes, but then,
I was a very depressed child.

92
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,429
To poor decisions.

93
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,265
Hear, hear.

Seymour! I told you

95
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,228
not to play
in the neighbor's yard.

96
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,273
It's a party,
Mother.

97
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,066
I was invited.

98
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,439
Well...

99
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,945
Then I must've been
invited, too.

100
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,818
Help me, Edna.

101
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,655
I know where we can hole up
for a while.

102
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:10,665
(crying)

103
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,460
That's it.
Looking good.

104
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,843
Getting warm.

105
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,300
Uh... I feel queasy.

106
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,302
Don't stop, Milhouse.

107
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,633
You're so close.

108
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,967
I got to barf.

109
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,432
Where's the bathroom?

110
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,184

111
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,307
(all moaning and groaning)

112
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,444
Oh, my tummy!

113
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,402
I told you we should've served
cake instead of oysters.

114
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,283
I'm ruined!

115
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,150

00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,872
Bart, how come
you're not sick?

120
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,866
Eh! I gave my oysters
to the cat.

121
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,248
(retching)

122
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,335
Hey, why'd you eat them?

123
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,590
I thought
you were a vegetarian.

124
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,761
I didn't. I just
wanted to leave.

125
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,010
(fake groaning)

126
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,054
More tea, Edna?

127
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,346
What kind of little boy
has a tea set?

128
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,220
Hmm! I think we both
know the answer to that.

129
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,638
A lucky boy.

130
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,936
You know, Seymour,

131
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,900
there's an innocence about you
that can be quite charming.

132
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,941
Oh! Well, I've always admired
your tart honesty

133
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,067
and ability to be personally offended
by broad social trends.

134
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,485
Oh, really?

135
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,953
Mm-hmm. Very much.

136
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,123
And your laugh.

137
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,740
You mean, "Ha"?

138
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,537
Mm-hmm. That's the one
that makes me feel...

139
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,421
(breathing heavily)

140
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,788
Oh, boy.
(clears throat)

141
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,786
You have a breath mint
I could borrow?

142
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,798
I've got
some menthol cigarettes.

143
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,720
Oh, the heck with it.

144
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,114
BART: You are never going to guess
what I saw at Martin's party

145
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,074
after you guys left.

146
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,164
You know that playhouse?
Well, I--

147
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,568
-Good gravy!
-Oh, thank you.

148
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,076
It's just brown and water.

149
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,949
So I looked in the window
and there it was.

150
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,206
The grossest sight
I have ever...

151
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,168
SKINNER (on PA):
<i>Bart Simpson, report to</i>

152
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,208
<i>the principal's office</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

153
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,881
Now, Bart... son...

154
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,800
I don't know
what you think you saw

155
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,839
but, let me assure you...

156
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,383
What Seymour... Oh...

157
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,086
What Principal Skinner
means to say, Bart,

158
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,966
is that sometimes
a little boy's imagination

159
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,053
can run away with him.

160
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,217
That's the best
you can do?

161
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,346
You could have at least said
you were giving her C.P.R.

162
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,773
or rehearsing a play.

163
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,401
Is it too late
to say that?

164
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,439
Mm-hmm.

165
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,822
(clears throat)

166
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:39,978
We're just a little concerned.

167
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,316
If people were to find out

168
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,741
the principal
was dating a teacher,

169
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,069
they might see it as
a conflict of interest.

170
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,114
(laughs)

171
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,817
And...
There are those

172
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,527
who might try to use it
against us

173
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,537
for their own advantage.

174
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,538
Like me, for one.

175
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,579
Like you, for...

176
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,674
Bart, if life has taught me
one lesson repeatedly,

177
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,420
it's to know
when I'm beaten.

178
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,712
Let's talk deal.

179
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,639
(grunts)

180
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,354
As you know, Bart,

181
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,274
your permanent record
will one day disqualify you

182
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,352
from all but the hottest
and noisiest jobs.

183
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,688
What do you say, son?

184
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,272
You keep our secret,

185
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,897
and some other student
can inherit your gloomy

186
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:23,864
windblown future.

187
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,486
Deal.

188
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,781
This is a great day
for forbidden love.

189
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,787
Mmm. This dessert
is exquisite.

190
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,785
What do you call it?

191
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:40,876
Applesauce.

192
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,670
(chuckles)
Oh, of course.

193
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,344
I'm sorry. I don't get out
to restaurants much.

194
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,724
That's okay.
I don't entertain much.

195
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,141
Usually it's just soup
for one, salad for one,

196
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,511
wine for three.

197
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,178
(laughs) You know,
I always thought

198
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,636
I'd fall for a woman
just like Mother...

199
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,267
even though
I didn't want to.

200
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,613
And now that I haven't,

201
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,229
I've discovered what
true happiness can be, Edna.

202
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,107
Seymour, swallow
that applesauce

203
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,777
and kiss me.

204
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,195
I'm afraid I already swallowed
it while you were talking.

205
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,407
Mmm...

206
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,407
(Edna giggling)

207
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,668
Mmm...

208
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,963
Good morning, students.
Way to go there, Wendell.

209
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,626
There's Ralph--
He knows the score.

210
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,625
Jimbo,
how's that hat today?

211
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,837
Janie, Janie, bo-phaney!

212
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,968
The only way to survive
a deadly blaze is...

213
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,426
Oh, heck, life's too short
for fire safety.

214
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,057
Let's go outside
and pick wild flowers.

215
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:42,273
(cheering)

216
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,975
SKINNER (on PA): <i>Bart Simpson to</i>
<i>the principal's office.</i>

217
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,605
<i>Post haste.</i>

218
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,071
<i>(Skinner humming</i>
<i>"Eine kleine nacht musik")</i>

219
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,989
Bart, so good to see you.

220
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,365
I have a little favor
to ask you.

221
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,491
I'd like you
to give this note

222
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,697
to Edna when you
get back to class.

223
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,037
I don't think
I have to tell you

224
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,502
it's for her eyes only.

225
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,676
<i>"Dear Edna"--</i>
<i>(mumbling)</i>

226
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,219
(sing-song)
I hear reading.

227
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,410
Do you think
anyone saw us?

228
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,292
No. It went
just as we planned.

229
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,460
Except they confiscated
my thermos of cola at the door.

230
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,119
Ohh--

231
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,837
Skinner, Krabappel,
what are you two doing here?

232
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:46,918
Superintendent Chalmers!

233
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,303
Uh, why, we're--

234
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,379
We're, uh, on a, uh--

235
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:53,134
-a-- what do you call-- field trip.
-Uh, with a student.

236
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,547
-Yes! He's, uh...
-He's purchasing refreshments

237
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,926
-in the lobby.
-I'll go get him right now.

238
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,524
(whispering)
Car keys, car keys, car keys.

239
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,321
(sleepily) Stop pushing me.
What's going on?

240
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,112
Just enjoy the movie.
It has Tom Berenger.

241
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,750
You think they actually
filmed this in Atlanta?

242
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,459
I don't know.

243
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,919
I don't think
it's important.

244
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,039
Yeah.

245
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,415
(honking)

246
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,431
Mother doesn't approve
of me dating,

247
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,888
so I need you to keep
her busy for a few hours

248
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,639
while Edna and I sneak out.

249
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,809
(door slams)

250
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,931
Oh, I can't take
much more of this.

251
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,808
I collect
pictures of cakes

252
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,855
that I clip out
of the magazines.

253
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,938
It all started in 1941

254
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,654
when Good Housekeeping featured
a photo of a lovely cake.

255
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,656
{\an8}You wouldn't happen to have any
real cakes around here, would you?

256
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,279
Oh, my no.
I don't care for cake. Too sweet.

257
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,867
Now, this is called
a Lady Baltimore cake.

258
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,913
At my age, I don't have
much saliva left

259
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,367
so you'll have
to lick my thumb

260
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,537
before
I can turn the page.

261
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,166
Oh, can't I just turn
the page for you?

262
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,502
No!

263
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,377
But you can pick out
any picture

264
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,384
you want to take home
with you.

265
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,086
Okay.
That one.

266
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,086
-No!
-Ow!

267
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,387
You can't have that one!

268
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,970
That's a coconut cake!

269
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,255
(pencils scratching paper)

270
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,306
Bart Simpson!

271
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,404
How many times do I have
to tell you no talking!

272
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,980
Report
to the principal's office!

273
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,435
But-but I wasn't...

274
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,275
-And here, take this with you.
-(groans)

275
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,490
Mrs. Krabappel,
Bart has something

276
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,531
he wants to say to you.

277
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,824
-I won't say it!
-Bart!

278
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,197
(groans)
Oh...

279
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,581
I love you,
Edna Krabappel.

280
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,584
(children laughing)

281
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,876
(chanting)
Bart's going to marry the teacher.

282
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,050
Where are you
registered, Simpson?

283
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,589
(groans)

284
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,592
Thank you, Bart.

285
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,593
That was very sweet.

286
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,844
You may sit down now.

287
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,676
They're not going
to get away with this.

288
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,561
I'm going to step out
for a few minutes, class.

289
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,519
Martin,
you're in charge.

290
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,517
Now, Bart, uh...

291
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,851
(coughs)

292
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,356
You must promise not
to fall in love with me.

293
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,819
(children laughing)

294
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,689
Now, Martin's scoring
off me.

295
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,066
Oh, that is it.

296
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,573
Listen up, everybody!

297
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,034
Follow me!

298
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,575
What's going on, huh?

299
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,620
What's happening,
Simpson?

300
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,754
Where are we going,
anyway?

301
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,458
Okay, crew...

302
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,591
Set your faces to stunned.

303
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,842
(all gasp)

304
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,426
Um...

305
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,392
Um...

306
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,353
School dismissed.

307
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,228
And then Bart
opened the door

308
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,981
and Principal Skinner
and Mrs. Krabappel

309
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,362
were kissing!

310
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,979
-(gasps)
-And swearing.

311
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,775
Father, Uncle Apu,

312
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,989
a teacher was in the closet
with the principal

313
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,069
and he had as many arms
as Vishnu

314
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,905
and they were
all very busy.

315
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,660
-(gasps)
-Wow.

316
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,832
I was in the library,
at the time,

317
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,411
but Janie told me
that Principal Skinner

318
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,866
and Bart's teacher, Mrs...

319
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:10,865
What's her name?

320
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:11,866
Krabappel?

321
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,287
Yeah, Krabappel.

322
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,915
They were naked
in the closet together.

323
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,712
Oh, my goodness!

324
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,166
Wait a minute.

325
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,375
Bart's teacher
is named "Krabappel"?

326
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,636
I've been calling her
"Crandall."

327
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,048
Why didn't someone tell me?

328
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,267
Oh, I've been making
an idiot out of myself!

329
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,559
Mrs. Krabappel
and Principal Skinner

330
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,273
were in the closet
making babies,

331
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,943
and I saw one of the babies,

332
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,321
and the baby looked at me.

333
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,068
Baby looked at you?

334
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,610
Sara, get me
Superintendent Chalmers.

335
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,280
-Thank you, Sara.
-Hmm.

336
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,490
-Skinner!
-Uh, Superintendent Chalmers.

337
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,537
The whole town's in an uproar
about your sleazy shenanigans.

338
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,212
Now, I'm going to
give you a choice.

339
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,090
You can give up this tawdry
fulfilling relationship

340
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,959
or you two will be
out of here so fast

341
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,166
your mortarboards
will spin.

342
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,546
And where is
your mortarboard anyway?

343
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,933
Uh... Right here, sir.

344
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,345
So, what'll it be, Seymour?

345
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,679
Well...

346
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:13,305
I'm sorry, but, uh, I can't
give up the woman I love.

347
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,524
Well, then I'm afraid
you leave me no choice.

348
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,855
I want you out
of the building by 3:00.

349
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,241
-You're fired. Edna, too.
-(gasps)

350
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,487
Well, it's going to be hard
to say good-bye to all of you.

351
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,326
We've had a lot
of fun together.

352
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,707
Nelson, Nelson, Nelson.

353
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,591
How many kids
have you beaten up this year?

354
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,918
I don't know-- 50.

355
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,763
Ah, 50.

356
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,049
Where does the time go?

357
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,426
You, uh, you wanted to see me,
Principal Skinner?

358
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,773
Mm-mm.
It's Mr. Skinner now.

359
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,389
I'm just a man.

360
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,305
Bart, I want to apologize
for the awkward position

361
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,935
Edna and I put you in.

362
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,612
Your-- Your help made
our love possible.

363
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,031
I don't know
what we'll do without you.

364
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,202
Well, so long.

365
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,827
Wait a second!

366
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,159
You don't have to leave
just because

367
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,203
Superintendent Chalmers
told you to.

368
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,197
What are you getting at?

369
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,498
You spent your whole life

370
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,331
following orders--
from your mother

371
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,626
the army,
Superintendent Chalmers...

372
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,050
Just this once, man,
stand up for yourself.

373
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,130
Okay, Bart.

374
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,134
Let's go, Seymour.

375
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,875
Okay, Edna.

376
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,257
Uh... No, wait!

377
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,005
We're not going anywhere.

378
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,386
I'm going to do what Bart
should have told me to do

379
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,984
a long time ago.

380
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,057
Attention, Springfield.

381
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,607
We have barricaded ourselves
in the school

382
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:46,031
and are not coming down
until our demands are met.

383
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,611
Willie hears you.
Willie don't care.

384
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,407
Obviously, you two
have no experience

385
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,742
causing a scene.

386
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,035
I'll be right there.

387
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,294
All right people,

388
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,666
we've got
an escaped octopus

389
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:02,672
on the roof
of Springfield Elementary.

390
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,673
Let's roll.

391
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,634
Two cameras.

392
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,299
So, once again,
I've been had.

393
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,505
But an even more
interesting story

394
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,255
has developed high atop
this two-story school:

395
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,718
A love story.

396
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,768
Skinner,
get off of my school.

397
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,691
No.
You get off of my school.

398
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,611
Homer,
Bart's up there!

399
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,270
Give me that!

400
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,938
Bart,
this is your father!

401
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,697
Do you know
where the remote is?

402
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,621
I looked
all over the house.

403
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,910
Did you check
your pocket?

404
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,406
It was--

405
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,496
It was in my pocket.

406
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,006
Fine.
Stay in the school.

407
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,840
We don't want you
to come out.

408
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:50,875
BART: You got it.

409
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,548
Damn.
All right, boys,

410
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,966
roll up the sound truck.

411
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,764
We'll blast them out
with music.

412
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,234
(feeedback squeals)

413
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,110
(melodic acoustic piano
playing "Embraceable you")

414
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,526
<i>♪ Embrace me, my sweet... ♪</i>

415
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,786
Oh, Edna, I hope
this siege never ends.

416
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,410
Seymour, you're heaven
in hush puppies.

417
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,667
Oh...

418
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,669
Turn the music off!

419
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,341
Ha! It's working
like a charm, boys.

420
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,760
Now cut the power
and hit them with the lights.

421
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:34,139
<i>♪ ...Irreplaceable you ♪</i>

422
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:39,271
<i>♪ Just one look at you ♪</i>

423
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,309
<i>♪ My heart grew tipsy... ♪</i>

424
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,524
Ugh!

425
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,987
-(ringing)
-I'll get it.

426
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,122
-Talk to me.
-You have got to end this thing, Seymour.

427
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,950
We're not coming down
until our jobs are reinstated

428
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,076
and you acknowledge
and celebrate our love.

429
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,623
No one would like to celebrate
your love more than I

430
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,287
but I'm a public servant

431
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,795
and not permitted to use
my own judgment in any way.

432
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,128
Then let us take our case
directly to the towns people.

433
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,174
Oh, yeah, that'll be
real productive.

434
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,337
Who do you want
to talk to first?

435
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,005
The guy in the bumblebee suit

436
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,354
or the one with the bone
through his hair?

437
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,388
My opinions
are as valid

438
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,772
as the next man's!

439
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,978
Yeah, all right.
Just come on down.

440
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,189
Well... This is it.

441
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,399
What are you going to do?

442
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,979
I'm going to go out there

443
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,944
and tell every man,
woman and child

444
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,904
that I love
Edna krabappel.

445
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,364
Well, that's nice,

446
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,404
but first you got to grab
their attention.

447
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,277
And I think I know how.

448
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:40,204
I have a bomb.

449
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,115
ALL:
(gasping and murmuring)

450
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,245
Hey, wait a minute.

451
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,211
Those are hot dogs.

452
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,631
Armour hot dogs.

453
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,749
What kind of man wears
Armour hot dogs?

454
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,208
It was a good idea, Bart,

455
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,377
but it's just not working.

456
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,886
Just speak
from the heart, Seymour.

457
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,049
Tell them how we brought
a little happiness

458
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,678
into each other's lives.

459
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,854
Ask them why they're forcing
two dedicated people

460
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,314
to choose between their
careers and their hearts.

461
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,975
Excuse me, Edna.

462
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,903
I don't think we're talking
about love here.

463
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,113
We're talking about s-e-x

464
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:16,203
in front
of the c-h-i-l-d-r-e-n.

465
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,410
Sex Cauldron?

466
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,199
I thought they closed
that place down.

467
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,203
What are you people
talking about?

468
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,405
My child told me
you two were having sex

469
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,825
in the school janitor's
closet.

470
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,923
You know, "Making babies"?

471
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,459
Yes, illicit sex.

472
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,252
Doing it! It! It!

473
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,415
Sordid public sexual
congress!

474
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,094
This is absurd.

475
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,343
I did not have relations
in that closet,

476
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,425
and the fact is,
I haven't...

477
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,300
Uh...

478
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,267
(crickets chirping)

479
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,638
Yes?

480
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,596
Seymour, I think
you'd better tell them.

481
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,306
It's the only way
to clear our names.

482
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,435
(sighs)

483
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,486
Well, everyone,
the fact is

484
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,320
I haven't ever
had relations.

485
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,277
I am a virgin.

486
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,501
Ha-ha!

487
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,499
(all murmuring)

488
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,460
Hey, does this mean

489
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,343
that Mrs. Krabappel
is a virgin, too?

490
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,550
KRABAPPEL:
Ha!

491
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,340
Well, Seymour,
it's clear

492
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,053
you've been falsely accused

493
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:22,353
because no one...
anywhere... ever...

494
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,519
Would pretend to be
a 44-year-old virgin.

495
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,929
Oh, that's for sure.

496
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,647
I'm, I'm inclined to agree.

497
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,308
Ugh! I'll never look
at him the same again.

498
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,147
That was more than
I wanted to know.

499
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,483
(clears throat)

500
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,527
Okay, well, um,
Edna, Seymour,

501
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:41,071
in light of these, uh...
uh... revelations

502
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,696
I, uh, suppose we,
uh... overreacted.

503
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,164
Do we have our jobs back?

504
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,374
What?
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Sure.

505
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,754
Just, uh, you know,
keep the lewdness to a minimum.

506
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,674
I'm out of here.

507
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,797
Skinny, Krabby,
catch you later.

508
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,344
Uh, hold on, Bart.

509
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,217
May we have
a word with you?

510
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,474
We want to thank you
for helping us

511
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,555
through
a difficult period.

512
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,140
Oh, no problemo.

513
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,345
So, I guess now
you'll be getting married

514
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,234
or something, huh?

515
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,361
Well, actually, Seymour and I
have decided to break up.

516
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,649
Huh?

517
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,322
We can't continue on like this,

518
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,321
trying to build a private
relationship in public--

519
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,283
The whole town
watching our every move

520
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,663
with a fine-tooth comb.

521
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,409
Mm-hmm. I'm used
to humiliation

522
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,201
but not in front
of a crowd that size.

523
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,405
But you seemed
like such a good couple.

524
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,455
Bart, when you get
a little older

525
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,420
you're going to learn
that, sometimes, romances

526
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,920
don't turn out exactly
the way you'd like them to.

527
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,133
Hmm...

528
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,764
That's why I love
elementary school, Edna:

529
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,222
The children believe
anything you tell them.

530
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,389
(chuckling)

531
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,312
(both laughing)

532
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,522
