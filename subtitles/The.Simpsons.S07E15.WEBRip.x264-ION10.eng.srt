May I offer my condolences

00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,527
{\an8}on the untimely passing

8
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,533
{\an8}of your great Aunt Hortense.

9
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,985
{\an8}As her only living heirs

10
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:37,405
{\an8}you stand to inherit
her entire estate.

{\an8}Whoo-hoo!

17

{\an8}The only stipulation

18
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:50,631
{\an8}is that you spend one night
in a haunted house.

19
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,427
{\an8}Oh. Isn't that somewhat unusual?

20
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,010
{\an8}No. It's a standard clause.

21
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:58,556
{\an8}Well, luckily,
there's no such thing as ghosts.

22
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:06,398
{\an8}Yes, there's no
such thing as ghosts.

{\an8}Best night's sleep

{\an8}Their tap water

26
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,330
{\an8}tasted better
than ours.

27
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,923
{\an8}Here you go.

28
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,248
{\an8}$100 each.

29
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,294
{\an8}The rest goes
to Ann Landers

30
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,457
{\an8}as was stipulated
in your Aunt's will.

31
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:29,456
Hmm?

32
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,797
Oh, I'm sorry.

33
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,472
I must have
continued talking

34
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,430
after you left
the office.

35
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,351
I do that sometimes.

36
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,559
(diabolical laugh)

37
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,848
Oh, my!

38
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,057
What are you going to spend
your money on, kids?

39
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,107
There's a special on tacos
down at The Tacomat:

40
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,071
a hundred tacos for a hundred dollars.
I'm gonna get that.

41
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,861
I'm going to
contribute my money

42
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,905
to the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting.

43
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,158
Tacos?!

44
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,080
Public broadcasting?!

45
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,658
I won't have you kids throwing
your money away like that.

46
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,834
You're both coming downtown with me and
you're gonna put that money in the bank.

47
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:11,382
Boy, I sure could go for
100 tacos right about now.

48
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,094
No!

49
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,554
Yes, this should provide
adequate sustenance

50
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,215
for the Dr. Who marathon.

51
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,098
{\an8}MARGE:
You'll feel better knowing

52
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,483
{\an8}your money's in the hands
of professionals.

53
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,690
(muffled)
Ook Ook.

54
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,599
Are you folks ready
to go ape?

55
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,768
Mom?

56
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,726
A professional
in an ape mask

57
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,316
is still a professional.

58
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,281
And you'll find
that saving for your future

59
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,822
is far more thrilling
than any roller coaster.

60
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:40,116
Really? Wow! I should have
started a long time ago!

61
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,791
Mm-hmm. Now fill out
these forms.

62
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,621
I'm sure you'll find them
more exciting

63
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,826
than a weekend with Batman.

64
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,996
I got their new Thrifty
Saver savings account.

65
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,375
2.3% annual interest instead
of the normal 2.25.

66
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,093
So a year from now,
I'll have an extra nickel.

67
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,425
I got the account

68
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,889
where you get free
customized checks.

69
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,219
I chose the Hindenburg
flip-book series.

70
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,885
Cool!

71
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,683
Mmm. Checking accounts aren't
really for children, Bart.

72
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,597
No, Mom. I can handle it.

73
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,266
Let's see.
"Pay to the order of..."

74
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,645
Lisa-- one cent and no cents.

75
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,074
And now, the old John Hancock.

76
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,783
There you go.

77
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,113
Thank you.

78
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,068
MILHOUSE:
$1 million!

79
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,238
Thanks, Bart!
I owe you one.

80
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,697
That's a postdated
check remember.

81
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,326
Don't cash it till
the year 10,000.

82
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,873
Okay.

83
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,416
(watch ticks)

84
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,672
Excellent!

85
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,297
As soon as the check clears,
I'll let you go.

86
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,812
-Krusty!
-Krusty!

87
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,560
That's it.
No more autographs.

88
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,892
I gotta go.

89
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,806
They're naming
a new sandwich after me

90
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,805
at my restaurant.

91
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,306
Oh!

92
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,727
That's okay, Bart.
You can share mine.

93
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,645
Quick-- press against me while

94
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,364
the ink's still wet.

95
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,204
No need. I'm going to
get Krusty's autograph

96
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,489
the easy way.

97
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,202
If he wants these 25 cents

98
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,742
he'll have to endorse the check
by signing it on the back.

99
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,036
Then, when my monthly
bank statement comes

100
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,870
I'll get the check back
complete with autograph.

101
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,077
No fuss, no muss.

102
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,918
That's a good plan,

103
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,134
{\an8}but it won't impress
girls like this.

104
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,925
{\an8}-Ew!
-Ew!

105
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,298
{\an8}(laughing heartily)

106
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,715
Lisa's autograph...

107
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,886
Apu's autograph...

108
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,175
Oh, what do you know?

109
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,938
Jimbo's real name is Corky.

110
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,599
And...

111
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,228
Krusty!

112
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,654
Hey! "Cayman Islands
Offshore Holding Corporation"?

113
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,612
Krusty was supposed
to sign this.

114
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,027
Take it back
and make him sign it.

115
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,195
Ah, no, no.

116
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,913
Stamping the back
of a check

117
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,703
is perfectly legal,
little boy.

118
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,406
Many people do it
to save time.

119
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,916
You see, in this case,
instead of writing out his name

120
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,749
Krusty has stamped the name

121
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,174
of his Cayman Islands
Holding Corporation

122
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,092
on the... hmm.

123
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,591
Ah, excuse me a minute.

124
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:07,768
(chuckles)

125
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,729
Oh, I'm sorry.

126
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,439
I can't divulge information

127
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,569
about that customer's
secret illegal account.

128
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,738
Oh, crap. I shouldn't have
said he was a customer.

129
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,238
Oh, crap! I shouldn't have
said it was a secret.

130
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,911
Oh, crap!

131
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,909
I certainly shouldn't
have said it was illegal.

132
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,412
Ah. It's too hot today.

133
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,461
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

134
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,666
I bought this popcorn
fair and square!

135
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,755
{\an8}Sorry, the bank is...

136
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,893
Oh, kid!

137
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:45,929
Gosh, I meant to tell you.

138
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,722
Turns out that Krusty

139
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,675
is one of the biggest
tax cheats in history,

140
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,096
and they nailed him--
all thanks to you.

141
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,935
-(gasps)
-Some might say you're a hero, kid.

142
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,322
Not me, however.
I love Krusty.

Krusty's my hero.

152
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,351
How could I do this
to him?

153
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,393
It is a tragedy
for all us kids,

154
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,897
but, Bart, you can't
beat yourself up.

155
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,858
Yeah. There'll be
enough people

156
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,769
to do that for me
at recess tomorrow.

157
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,782
Oh, I can't go to jail!

158
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,704
I got a swanky lifestyle.

159
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,583
I'm used to the best.

160
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,790
Krusty, this is America.
We don't send our celebrities to jail.

161
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,751
We're just going
to garnish your salary.

162
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,462
Garnish my celery?

163
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,462
Please, Krusty, no jokes.

164
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,964
Who's joking?

165
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,755
Oy! Oh, I don't know
what you're saying.

166
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,880
It all sounds
so crazy to me.

167
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,757
It simply means we'll be
taking part of your salary

168
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,644
until your debt
is repaid.

169
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,060
Say, 75% for 40 years.

170
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,560
But I don't plan
to live that long.

171
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,311

00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,448
<i>this show's got to be</i>
<i>a lot more cost-effective.</i>

178
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,544
<i>So we had to cut down</i>
<i>on the frills</i>

179
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,159
<i>like sets, props, costumes</i>
<i>and Sideshow Mel.</i>

180
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,577
<i>But that doesn't mean</i>
<i>we can't have fun.</i>

181
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,586
<i>For example, I sure wish</i>
<i>somebody would give me</i>

182
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,839
<i>a banana cream pie.</i>

183
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,380
<i>Yeah!</i>

184
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,384
Uh...

185
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,427
I guess we can't afford pies
right now.

186
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,800
Well, throw something!

187
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:51,967
(screams)

188
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,144
Oh, that corner...

189
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,353
(groaning)

190
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:06,817
Um, I'll have
four tax burgers,

191
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,913
one I.R.S.-wich,
withhold the lettuce

192
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,869
three dependent-sized sodas,

193
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,369
and a fico-ccino.

194
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,161
Fill out Schedule B.

195
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,254
You should receive
your burgers

196
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,159
in six to eight
weeks.

197
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,997
(mumbling)
Eh, let's see here...

198
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,003
Add Schedule B, divide 53...

199
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,835
take away...

200
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,841
Hey, Marge, what were your
gambling losses last year?

201
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,134
MARGE:
$700.

202
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,757
They took my money.

203
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,217
They wrecked my show.

204
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,017
They buried a bunch
of stinking veterans

205
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,890
in my family plot,

206
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,517
but at least I still got
my memories.

207
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,315
Those are locked up safe

208
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,898
in my fabulous mansion.

209
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,404
And now, lot number 66,
a handmade leather suitcase

210
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,818
carried by the Krustofsky family

211
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,156
upon their arrival
at Ellis Island in 1902.

212
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,912
A priceless heirloom

213
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,503
and historic piece of Krustiana.
What am I bid?

214
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,499
40 cents.

215
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,750
I got 40 cents.

216
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,961
40 cents over there,
40 cents over here.

217
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,042
40 cents over there,
40 cents over here.

218
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,877
Who'll give me 50?
Do I hear 50, 50?

219
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,633
Sold for 40 cents.

220
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,424
40 cents?

221
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,338
Ach! My Grampa Zev
would turn over in his grave

222
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,967
if it wasn't filled
with some veteran.

223
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,684
Lot 67,
32 cartons of pornography.

224
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,686
-Ten cents.
-12!

225
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,098
12 cents to our phone bidder
in Japan.

226
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,566
-Any advance?
-All I brought is a dime.

227
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,278
I didn't know
there would be pornography.

228
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,028
Sold for 12 cents.

229
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,900
Oh, my beloved pornography.

230
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,947
I can't watch this anymore.

231
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,660
I'm going to bed.

232
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,030
How much for Krusty's bed?

233
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,657
-Half a buck!
-Sold!

234
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,703
Goodnight, everybody.

235
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,866
ALL:
Good night, Moe!

236
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,834
(groaning)

237
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,754
And now, lot number 2,380,
Krusty's private plane,

238
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,035
The <i>I'm On A Rolla Gay.</i>

239
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,798
KRUSTY:
But I love that plane.

240
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,919
I used to fly to Vegas
in it with Dean Martin.

241
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,927
One night, he looked out
the window,

242
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,849
and the moon hit his eye
like a big pizza pie.

243
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,468
We wrote a song about it,

244
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,675
but it ended up infringing
on one he recorded years before.

245
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,686
Hey Selma, that plane
would go great

246
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:03,978
with your
new suitcase.

247
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:07,111
Nah, I just bought it
to soak my feet in.

248
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,569
(moaning)

249
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,278
Krusty. Hi.

250
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,616
Is it okay
if I sit down here?

251
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,702
Go ahead, kid.

252
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,826
Knock yourself out.

253
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,332
I'm sorry
for all the trouble

254
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,874
I've caused you, Krusty.

255
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,327
But, you know,
my Mom says

256
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,087
God never closes a door
without opening a window.

257
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,130
No offense, kid,
but your Mom's a dingbat.

258
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,974
There's no
silver lining here.

259
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,140
I was a big cheese.

260
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,758
A huge cheese!

261
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,635
But now look at me.

262
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,022
I got to ride the bus
like a schnook!

263
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,769
I got to live in
an apartment like an idiot!

264
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,402
I got to wait in line
with nobodies

265
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,070
to buy groceries
from a failure!

266
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,939
It doesn't matter how you live
or what you did wrong.

267
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,657
As long as you're on TV,
people will respect you.

268
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,618
Respect? Bah!

269
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,868
What good is respect

270
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,789
without the moolah
to back it up?

271
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:04,248
Everywhere I go,
I see teachers in Ferraris,

272
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,170
research scientists
drinking champagne.

273
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,419
I tried to drink a Coke
on the bus

274
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,252
and they took away my pass!

275
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,957
That's no life
for a famous clown.

276
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,878
Well, if it'll make you
feel any better, Krusty,

277
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,506
you can punch me in the face.

278
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,099
Nah, forget it!

279
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,180
Go home, kid.

280
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,312
-(buzzing in distance)
-(bell dings)

281
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,977
Shiva H. Vishnu!

282
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,855
Where is that noise
coming from?

283
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:37,412
(Krusty bawling)

284
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,198
Well, I must say I've had
a lovely evening, Agnes.

285
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,782
I don't suppose
I could come in

286
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,787
for a cup of...

287
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,948
Seymour!

288
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,036
Mother...
(gasps)

289
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,081
Superintendent
Chalmers!

290
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,623
Skinner!

291
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,167
What I wouldn't give

292
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,500
for something to interrupt
this awkward moment.

293
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,995
(Krusty bawling)

294
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,458
That will do nicely.

295
00:11:56,674 --> 00:12:00,854
(bawling continues)

296
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,468
You got to hand it to Krusty.

297
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,265
Yeah, even with all his problems

298
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:08,058
he's still willing to do
something unbelievably dangerous

299
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,814
just to entertain his fans.

300
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,895
-Wow!
-Wow!

301
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,821
Oh, that's my Krusty.

302
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,819
I got a feeling
he'll be all right.

303
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,749
Oh, my God!

304
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,960
Krusty's shoes!

305
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,619
Okay, folks,
show's over.

306
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,038
Nothing to see here.
Show's...

307
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,246
Oh, my God!

308
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,495
A horrible plane crash!

309
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,968
Hey, everybody, get a load
of this flaming wreckage!

310
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,678
Come on,
crowd around.

311
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,679
Crowd around. Don't be shy.
Crowd around.

312
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:47,983
Ladies and gentlemen,
Krusty the Clown...

313
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:48,978
is dead.

314
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,059
(all gasp)

315
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,030
I can't believe Krusty
is really gone.

316
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,533
Don't worry, son.

317
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,735
I'm sure he's up
in heaven right now

318
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,865
laughing it up with all
the other celebrities.

319
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:12,213
John Dillinger, Ty Cobb,
Joseph Stalin...

320
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,461
(sighs)

321
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,712
I wish I were dead.

322
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,707
We're gathered to mourn
the passing

323
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,628
of Herschel Shmoikel Krustofsky

324
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,926
beloved entertainer
and dear friend.

325
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,760
Hello, I'm Troy McClure.

326
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,055
You might remember me from such
show business funerals

327
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,479
as "Andre the Giant:
We Hardly Knew Ye"

328
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:33,058
and "Shemp Howard:
Today We Mourn a Stooge."

329
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,855
Now, Krusty's closest friend
and sidekick,

330
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,320
Sideshow Mel.

331
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,954
I'll miss you, Krusty

332
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,908
I, and all the other
sideshows...

333
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,699
except Sideshow Bob.

334
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,083
But in the midst
of our sorrow

335
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,950
we can take comfort
in the fact

336
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,867
that your elevated
blood alcohol level

337
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,916
probably helped you
burn up quicker.

338
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,709
Since you left us
no earthly remains,

339
00:13:56,794 --> 00:14:00,514
it is my sad duty to unveil
this simple memorial.

340
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,098
Next in our cavalcade
of celebrity mourners...

341
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,718
Bob Newhart.

342
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,101
(clearing throat)

343
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,564
See, to tell you
the truth, um...

344
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,816
I was-- I'm just
killing time here.

345
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,438
I was waiting
for a...

346
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,025
well, a different--

347
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,190
different funeral
to start.

348
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,738
I'll handle it.

349
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,201
Bob Newhart, everybody!

350
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,871
(applause)

351
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,996
Oh, um...

352
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,828
(coughs)
Although, you know,

353
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,543
though I-I started my career

354
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,173
several years before,
uh, Krusty,

355
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,961
so, you know, I could never

356
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,764
really learn
anything directly from him--

357
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,169
Uh, still...

358
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,967
I think in a way,
in a very meaningful way,

359
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,012
that I, uh...

360
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,555
uh... all of us...

361
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,848
have, uh, have learned

362
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,022
from him.

363
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,020
You know, that is, by...

364
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,562
uh, by being a clown
on television for...

365
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,146
for... for so many years

366
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,572
even, even though

367
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,951
many of us, we-- we didn't--

368
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,819
we didn't watch his show.

369
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,116
-(clearing throat)
-(feedback squeals)

370
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,829
Th-thank you.

371
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,251
-(scattered applause)
-(sniffles)

372
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,119
Well, that's the funeral, folks.

373
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,035
We'll be sitting Shiva
at the Friar's Club

374
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,794
at 7 p.m. and again at 10.

375
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,046
You must be over 18
for the 10.

376
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,548
It gets a little blue.

377
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:34,887
<i>And so Herschel Krustofsky</i>
<i>is gone, but not forgotten.</i>

378
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,885
<i>Today was the unveiling</i>
<i>of the new Krusty stamp.</i>

379
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,017
<i>Postal patrons</i>
<i>were asked to choose</i>

380
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,813
<i>between two competing designs:</i>

381
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,687
<i>one of Krusty's</i>
<i>heartwarming smile</i>

382
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,235
<i>and one of his fiery death.</i>

383
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,529
<i>By a nearly two-to-one vote,</i>
<i>the smiling Krusty was chosen.</i>

384
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:53,874
(mechanical groaning)

385
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,333
(groaning continues)

386
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,044
Don't let Krusty's death
get you down, boy.

387
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,915
People die all the time.

388
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,802
Just like that.

389
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,009
Why, you could
wake up dead tomorrow.

390
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,887
Well, good night.

391
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,930
(switch clicks)

392
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,272
(gasps)

393
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,772
Krusty!

394
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,113
(humming)

395
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,858
Mom! I just saw Krusty!

396
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,530
Yes, dear, in your mind.

397
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,068
No, on the street.

398
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,571
On the street in your mind.

399
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,783
Why won't you believe me?

400
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,702
Sweetheart, maybe
you just want Krusty

401
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,281
to be alive so badly,
you think you see him everywhere.

402
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,907
I went through the same thing
when Lyndon Johnson died.

403
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,463
DR. HIBBERT: And these pills
will help with the queasiness.

404
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,130
Krusty?

405
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,383
Doctor Hibbert,
Who was that man?

406
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,934
Now Bart, telling you
would violate

407
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,639
the patient-doctor
privilege,

408
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,719
just as if
I were to tell you

409
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,644
that Jasper here has
five seconds to live.

410
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,064
What'd he say?

411
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,142
He said I'm next.

412
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,021
Am I going crazy?

413
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,645
I'm seeing Krusty everywhere.

414
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,080
Bart, you're seeing Krusty
everywhere because you want

415
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,461
to tell him you're sorry
for causing his death.

416
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,668
Would it help if I told you
you're not responsible for Krusty's death?

417
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,129
Yes. Yes, it would.

418
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,799
Well, I can't. You'll just have to learn
to live with your mental problem.

419
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,709
Wait a minute--
all those things I saw.

420
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,127
There's a connection.

421
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,925
The truck full
of nets and buckets...

422
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,049
the queasy guy...
the lobsters...

423
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,716
they all point
to one thing.

424
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,684
Follow me.

425
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,897
Arr, I've got some customers.

426
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,820
Call me back, Ishmael.

427
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,859
Ahoy there, minnows.

428
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,164
Ahoy, have you
seen this man?

429
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,528
Arr, that's Handsome Pete.

430
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,775
He dances for nickels.

431
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,117
Pete, ye got
some customers.

432
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,923
(playing "Sailor's Hornpipe")

433
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,919
No, we're looking
for this man,

434
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:08,963
Krusty the Clown.

435
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,006
Mmm. Narr, narr, narr.

436
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,801
It's hopeless, Bart.

437
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,724
We've searched up and down
these docks, from pier one

438
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,683
to that Pier 1
by pier 17.

439
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,104
Lisa, look.

440
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,146
A signature with stars
around it, just like Krusty's.

441
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,940
Rory B. Bellows.

442
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,273
Slip 8. Let's go.

443
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,324
(playing "Sailor's Hornpipe")

444
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,952
Not a quarter.

445
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,949
Darr,
he'll be dancing for hours.

446
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,745
Are you Rory B. Bellows?

447
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,080
Yes.

448
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,794
How about Krusty
the Clown?

449
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,745
Sorry, I don't do impressions.

450
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,546
Well, if you're not Krusty,

451
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,169
how come you have
the exact same signature as him?

452
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,086
I'm Rory Bellows,
I tell you

453
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,974
and I got a lot
of corroborating evidence

454
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,682
over... here

455
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,562
by the throttle!

456
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,927
(chuckling)

457
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,805
Oh... you know you two could
have said something

458
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,727
instead of letting me
make an ass of myself.

459
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,316
Hey, you got a pacemaker scar
just like Krusty.

460
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,362
And Krusty's superfluous
third nipple.

461
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,115
(groaning)

462
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,618
Can't you see I don't want
to be Krusty anymore?

463
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,451
That's why
I faked my death.

464
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,326
But we saw your plane crash.

465
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,123
Yeah, but I wasn't in it.

466
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,497
Just before I hit the mountain

467
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,134
I jumped out of the plane

468
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,590
into a carefully placed net.

469
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,921
(groaning)

470
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,757
So now that we've blown
your cover,

471
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,142
I guess you gotta come back
and do your show again.

472
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,178
Or kill us...

473
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,351
(nervous giggling)

474
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,139
I won't be coming back, kids.

475
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,972
I got a sweet life here.

476
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,727
The sea air
is clearing my lungs.

477
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,599
The sun is toasting my
pale skin a healthy brown,

478
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,857
and most important, I learned

479
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,029
that I don't need money
to be happy.

480
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,488
All that high living
just distracted me

481
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,149
from my true calling in life:

482
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:01,657
salvaging sunken barges
for scrap iron.

483
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,832
Sorry kids, there's nothing
left for me on dry land anymore.

484
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,252
But Krusty, what about all the kids
who depend on you

485
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,081
to brighten up
their afternoons?

486
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,166
Are you gonna turn
your back on them?

487
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,251
Yes!

488
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,424
Come on, Lis,

489
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,927
Krusty doesn't want our
attention anymore.

490
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,549
Let's go worship
somebody who has

491
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,096
the guts to be
a celebrity.

492
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,389
Yeah, Krusty doesn't
want to be a clown.

493
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,483
He's happy just being
another blue-collar Bozo.

494
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,889
Meh.

495
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,859
Krusty's tired
of having phonies around

496
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,189
pretending
to be his friends.

497
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,193
I'm sure he'll find
plenty of people

498
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,185
who'll like him
for who he is.

499
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,277
Uh... it could happen.

500
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,283
Nah, who needs friends?

501
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,025
The incessant beep of
the global positioning system

502
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,577
is all the companionship
I need.

503
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,292
-(chuckling)
-(beeping)

504
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,372
(screams)

505
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,460
Tell me where you are now,
you bastard!

506
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,843
All right, I admit it.

507
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,091
I miss the phonies,
but that's all I miss.

508
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,304
That and Shirley Jones
and Marty Ingels'

509
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,925
New Year's Eve party.

510
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,641
What about that
great feeling you get

511
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,851
from knowing you're better
than regular people?!

512
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,192
BART: What about being an
illiterate TV clown

513
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,189
who's still more respected
than all the scientists,

514
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,441
doctors and educators in
the country put together?

515
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,488
Yeah!

516
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,699
I'm not going to let those guys
hog all the respect

517
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,370
while I'm out here
in some stinking tub.

518
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,116
That's just what
those eggheads want.

519
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,373
Well, forget it, Poindexter.

520
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,374
'Cause Krusty's back in town!

521
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,326
(cheering)

522
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,130
So, Krusty,
what are you going to do

523
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,677
about your tax problem?

524
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,220
Don't sweat it.

525
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,144
The life of Rory B. Bellows
is insured

526
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,313
for a surprisingly
large amount.

527
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:57,984
(cackling laughter)

528
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,030
{\an8}♪♪

529
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,202
Shh!
