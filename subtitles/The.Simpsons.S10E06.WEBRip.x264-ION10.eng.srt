{\an8}Ah, lunch time.

14
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,131
{\an8}Well, let's see what I've
packed for myself today.

15
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,549
{\an8}One bouillon cube.

16
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,840
{\an8}One Concord grape...

17
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,722
{\an8}One Philly cheesesteak...

18
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,885
{\an8}And a jar of garlic pickles.

19
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,063
{\an8}(chuckling)

20
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,521
{\an8}No one will want to kiss me
after these, eh, Smithers?

21
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,812
{\an8}Well, it's their loss, Sir.

22
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,266
{\an8}(chuckling)

23
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,145
{\an8}Yes.

24
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,943
{\an8}(grunting)

25
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,948
{\an8}Allow me, Sir.

26
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,029
{\an8}(grunting)

27
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,334
{\an8}(sighs) It's no use.

28
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,079
{\an8}Shall I send out
for some Chinese?

29
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,041
{\an8}No, those people
are all gristle.

30
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,412
{\an8}I want this jar open.

31
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,998

32
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,165
{\an8}(breathing heavily)

33
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,759
{\an8}Worthless old geezers.

34
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,549
{\an8}Phew... next.

35
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,215
{\an8}All righty, I'll just...

36
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,513
{\an8}(grunting)

37
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,466
{\an8}You stinking...

38
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,354
{\an8}(indistinct ranting)

39
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,893

00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,823
{\an8}Oh, for goodness sake.

42
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,110
{\an8}What we need around here
is some fresh blood.

43
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,704
{\an8}Would you like me
to drain Simpson

44
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,989
{\an8}while he's passed out, Sir?

45
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,622
{\an8}No, no. To attract the top
grads

46
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,410
{\an8}we'll need to make
a recruitment film,

47
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,583
{\an8}a picture that showcases
our cutting-edge technology.

48
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,623
A talkie, Sir?

49
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,456
Ah, yes, brilliant.

50
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,881
That's just the kind
of far-out gimmick we need.

51
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,967
And... action.

52
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,175
Wow, what a graduation.

53
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,221
I'll say.

54
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,854
But with college behind us

55
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,180
we'll need careers,
and good ones.

56
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,886
What about chestnut roasting?

57
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,476
People always need chestnuts.

58
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,481
Or begging.

59
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,482
I know a place that'll
saw your legs off.

60
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,864
Slow down, fellas.

61
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,610
I've got a way
we can keep our legs

62
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,322
and still have a bright future.

63
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,702
Now you're dreaming.

64
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:16,858
Oh, am I?

65
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,532
Of course. Nuclear power.

66
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,828
It's the job of tomorrow...

67
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,832
Today.

68
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:25,753
Really?

69
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,290
Well, that settles it.

70
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,753
For all those reasons and more

71
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,383
let us choose
an electrifying career in...

72
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,377
-line.
-(sighs)

73
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,054
Nuclear power.

74
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,682
Nuclear power.

75
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,220
Oh, you dunderheaded stooges
are the worst bunch of...

76
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,852
Hey.

77
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,274
Pretty good, huh?

78
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,772
Well, it's better than that
last Barbara Streisand movie.

79
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,315
I didn't quite get
the point of it, Dad.

80
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,648
Why would Lenny want someone
to saw his legs off?

81
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,154
Well, there were script problems
from day one.

82
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,447
Didn't seem like anybody
even read the script.

83
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,370
That was the problem.

84
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,738
The important thing is

85
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,084
after all these years
of paying my dues

86
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,830
I'm finally getting
some decent parts.

87
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,083
You're joining
the Screen Actors Guild?

88
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:12,035
I didn't choose to be
a gifted actor, Marge.

89
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,666
It chose me.

90
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,263
I'm merely a vessel through
which genius flows.

91
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,969
Now help me make up some
phony credits.

92
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,629
-Fat guy number three?
-Good, good.

93
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:22,177
Hey, Dad, it says they
need your full name.

94
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,812
You only put down
your middle initial.

95
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,308
Hey, what the heck is
your middle name, anyway?

96
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,811
You know... I have no idea.

97
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,765
Hey, Dad, what does
the "J" stand for?

98
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,314
How should I know?

99
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,938
(grunting)

100
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,439
It was your mother's job
to name you

101
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,698
and love you and such.

102
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,949
I was mainly in it
for the spanking.

103
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,201
But I can't ask Mom.

104
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,833
She's on the run from the law.

105
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,499
Serves her right
for being a '60s radical--

106
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,748
Though she was a demon
in the sack.

107
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,132
(chuckling)

108
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,594
Uh, so, Dad, regarding that
form

109
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,011
why not just make up
a middle name?

110
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,009
You might as well.

111
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,630
You already made up
a phony film credit.

112
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:04,347
No. Homer Simpson does not lie
twice on the same form.

113
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,059
He never has
and he never will.

114
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,769
You lied dozens of times
on our mortgage application.

115
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,730
Yeah, but they were all part

116
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,809
of a single ball of lies.

117
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,314
The point is, I'm a grown man

118
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,976
and I deserve a middle name.

119
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,114
Hmm, I know where

120
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,281
we might find your
missing moniker.

121
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,700
It's a bit of a drive,
but on the way

122
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:25,529
we can have a nice
father-son chat.

123
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,576
Great.

124
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,659
I'll go shoot myself
for bringing this up.

125
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,674
This is the hippie commune
your mother ran off to

126
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,665
when life with me
became a living hell.

127
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,296
Wow, look at this place.

128
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,215
There's a pond
for skinny-dipping

129
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,224
a tire for skinny-swinging.

130
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,596
I can actually feel
the good vibrations.

131
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,354
(buzzing)

132
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,806
Ouch.

133
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,475
I remember them.

134
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,066
Seth and Munchie.

135
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,281
Look at those filthy,
lazy, flea-ridden...

136
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,242
Oh, hi there.

137
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,122
Hey, check it out.

138
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,279
Is that... Abe Simpson?

139
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,038
Geez, man, we haven't
seen you since Woodstock.

140
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,910
You went to Woodstock?

141
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:17,537
Your mother dragged us both
to that Godforsaken love-fest...

142
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,047
(playing "Star Spangled
Banner")

143
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:31,469
Boo! Bring on sha na na.

144
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,805
Whoa, mellow out, Abe.

145
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,604
Little Homer's trying to
groove.

146
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,607
(imitating guitar sounds)

147
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,699
Shame on you, boy.

148
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,825
Put some damn pants on

149
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,041
and then pull 'em down

150
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,251
'cause it's time for a
spanking.

151
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,211
Get a load
of Captain Bringdown.

152
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,632
Whoa.

153
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,090
Yeah, whoa.

154
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:05,551
But I want to play in the mud
and be a hippie.

155
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:09,013
Never. What you need's
a good long hitch in Vietnam.

156
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,385
There must be an enlistment tent
around here somewhere.

157
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,853
If I'd left it up to your
mother

158
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,694
you'd have ended up
in a hellhole like this--

159
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,610
just lying around, never
working

160
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,610
without a care in your head,

161
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,782
full of long, luxurious
hippie hair...

162
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:31,235
Oh, Homer J., how do
you keep your hair

163
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,615
so rich and full?

164
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,713
Lather, rinse, and repeat.

165
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,118
Always repeat.

166
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,416
Homer J., will you
teach us to make love?

167
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,470
Wow, I could have
lived like that?

168
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,668
You know, Homer,

169
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,047
your mom was
a pretty groovy chick.

170
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,345
And a demon in the sack.

171
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,639
(chuckling)

172
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,272
Oh, you heard about that, eh?

173
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,429
(laughs)

174
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,150
Heh. Anyway,
I--I still think about her

175
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,609
every time I walk by that mural

176
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,649
she painted.

177
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:08,949
Oh, my mother painted
that for me?

178
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,698
Oh, my God.

179
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,622
My middle name is
right behind that shrub.

180
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,701
I'll finally know
what "J" stands for.

181
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:20,827
From this moment forth,
I will be known as Homer...

182
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,127
Jay Simpson.

183
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,051
(sniffling)

184
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,588
It's so beautiful.

185
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,341
What a magical gift
for my mother to leave me.

186
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,014
She also left her old poncho.

187
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,513
Get off of there, Ginsberg.

188
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,466
(grunting)

189
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,140
I'll treasure this
poncho forever.

190
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,727
Uh, you might want
to wash that.

191
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:45,022
The dog has a lot
of skin and bladder problems.

192
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,027
All right,
we got what we came for

193
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,739
plus that stink rag to boot.

194
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:49,949
Now, let's hit the road.

195
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,282
<i>ABE: Just lyin' around...</i>

196
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,486
<i>never workin'...</i>

197
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,945
<i>without a care in...</i>

198
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,655
My head full of long,
luxurious hippie hair.

199
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,707
-I'll do it!
-What?

200
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,251
I'm going to be a hippie,
just like Mom wanted.

201
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,995
I'm going to let my spirit soar

202
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,587
and love all of God's
creatures.

203
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,763
Get off, you stupid dog.

204
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,181
(growling)

205
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,755
Okay. If I'm gonna be
a real hippy,

206
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,767
I have to learn from the
master.

207
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,559
Mr. Bob Flower-child Hope.

208
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,819
Hey, peace, man,
far out groovy, I'm a hippy.

209
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,398
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Jill St. John.

210
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,486
(crowd cheering)

211
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,788
Hey, Bob, I just came
to invite you to the love-in.

212
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:38,998
(gurgles)

213
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,118
I got you a date
with the perfect flower child-

214
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,866
Phyllis Diller.

215
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,788
(audience laughing)

216
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,707
Let's get it on.

217
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,206
(cackling)

218
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,011
Now I know
how Dean Rusk feels.

219
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,723
Good night, everybody.

220
00:09:55,803 --> 00:10:00,023
Bummer. Love-in. Dean Rusk.
By George, I've got it!

221
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,850
Dad, do you mind?

222
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,686
Your feet are really
close to my potato.

223
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,822
Your potato?

224
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:11,148
You can't, like,
own a potato, man.

225
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,315
It's one
of Mother Earth's creatures.

226
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,315
(loud burp)

227
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,576
Homer, excuse yourself.

228
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,038
No way, narc.

229
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,198
Bodily functions
are a natural thing.

230
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,867
Not to mention hilarious.

231
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,165
(rude armpit noise)

232
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,828
You know, I really
don't appreciate

233
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:26,786
being called a narc,

234
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,296
and that poncho is filthy.

235
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,128
Let me dry-clean it for you.

236
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,213
(whimpering)

237
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,838
Why do you have
to turn everything

238
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,474
into one big plastic hassle?

239
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,302
Marge, you've got
too many hang-ups,

240
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,927
like the whole shaving trip.

241
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,024
Come on.

242
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,138
I want to see those legs
all furry and gross.

243
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,975
That ain't going to happen,
bub.

244
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,651
Well, at least lose the bra.

245
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,859
Free the "Springfield Two,"
Marge!

246
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,109
Free the "Springfield Two"!

247
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,942
I think you've had
too much strawberry wine.

248
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,028
(muttering)

249
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,704
WOMAN (shrieking) : Help!

250
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,373
Oh, I've never seen
anything like--

251
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,452
my eyes have been soiled.

252
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,707
Come on, Maude.

253
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,669
The human wang
is a beautiful thing.

254
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,419
Homer, for God's sakes,
put your poncho on.

255
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,002
Okay, okay.

256
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,512
(mutters) Narc.

257
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,425
(grunting noises)

258
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,889
-Oh!
-Ooh!

259
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,351
Heads up!

260
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,099
Hey, it's Homer Jay.

261
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,731
My man,
you've gone granola.

262
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,769
Right on.

263
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,981
Join the hack.

264
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,569
(grunting)

265
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,701
That was cool.

266
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,408
Think I'll stick around.

267
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,238
We've got everything
we need right here--

268
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,913
Good times, sunshine, free
love.

269
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,253
(purring growl)

270
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,708
(bell rings)

271
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,458
Okay, time to get back to work.

272
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,630
Work? But you're hippies.

273
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,959
Oh, we were on a break.

274
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,253
Time is money, man.

275
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,974
Huh?

276
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,762
What is this place?

277
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,596
We are the largest
organic juice company

278
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,272
{\an8}in Springfield.

279
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,940
We grow our own vegetables
and process them right here

280
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,729
and we give half
the profits to war orphans.

281
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,784
Profits, profits, profits!

282
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,649
What kind of hippies are you?

283
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,106
Peter Fonda must be spinning
in his grave.

284
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,945
We're just trying
to pay the bills, Homer.

285
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,704
I mean, we're still
hippies at heart.

286
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,036
Oh, yeah?
When's the last time

287
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,961
you freaked out
the establishment?

288
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,829
You guys are total sellouts!

289
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,246
Wait. Don't you work
for a nuclear power plant?

290
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:38,716
Look, we can sit here all day
and play the blame game

291
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,799
or we can start
freaking people out.

292
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,505
Come on.
Where's your freak bus?

293
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,925
I drive a Saturn.

294
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,723
HOMER: A Saturn?

295
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,266
We used to have a bus.

296
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,849
In a way, the '60s ended
the day we sold it--

297
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,475
December 31, 1969.

298
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,153
Yeah, an old-time freak-out
sounds tempting, Homer,

299
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,362
but we've got
a big order to fill.

300
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,443
Fine.

301
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,857
I guess the juice business
is more important

302
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,616
than the ideals
our hippie forefathers

303
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,329
refused to go to war
and die for.

304
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,830
(sighs)

305
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:11,422
I suppose we could duck out
for a couple of hours.

306
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,249
Hey, we'll call it
a business trip

307
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,844
and write off the mileage.

308
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,669
Now your
freak flag's flying!

309
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,634
Let the freak-out begin!

310
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,094
Woo-hoo!

00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,303

We're never going to freak
anybody out with this music.

315
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,266
I brought something
from my personal stash

316
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,774
that'll blow some minds.

Hey, square,
expand your mind.

322
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,421
The doors of perception
are open for business.

323
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,251
(chuckles)
Thanks for the tip, Homer.

324
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,337
Never fear!

325
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,973
The cosmic fool is here

326
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:08,561
to blow the lid off your
conformist, button-down world.

327
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,809
(high-pitched laughter)

328
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,728
Weirdos.

329
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,272
Hi, Marge.

330
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,602
We're freaking out squares.

331
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,227
Oh, lord.

332
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,903
What's in your
brand-new bag, mama?

333
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,072
Uh, it's that pair
of dockers you wanted--

334
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,570
48 waist with
the balloon seat, right?

335
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,993
(groans) Marge,
not in front of the hippies.

336
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,164
(bells tinkling)

337
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,412
Uh-oh. I don't like
the sound of that.

338
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,164
(bells tinkling)

339
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,996
(Homer screaming)Oh, please,
God, don't let them come in here.

340
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,332
(Homer screaming)

341
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,997
Hear ye! Hear ye!

342
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,835
The intergalactic jester
proclaims

343
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:44,431
this conformity factory closed.

344
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,428
(kids cheering)

345
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,340
Whoo-hoo!

346
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:52,392
Hmm. 15 years of loyal service
and this is how they tell me--

347
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,104
A jester with an
invisible proclamation.

348
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,765
(rock music playing)

349
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,686
That was fun.

350
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,903
I don't know if we actually
freaked anyone out, but...

351
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,154
No, no, no. Marge was
definitely freaked out.

352
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,276
Thanks, Homer.

353
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,822
It was nice to reconnect
with our hippie roots,

354
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,117
if only for a...

355
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,289
What the hell?

356
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,618
Oh, no!

357
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,623
Oh, man!

358
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,668
Your frisbee jammed
the juicilator, Homer.

359
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,013
Our entire shipment is ruined.

360
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,378
Uh, uh, pretty, uh, freaky,
huh?

361
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,887
The only people who are
going to be freaked out

362
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,679
are our stockholders.

363
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,393
I'm sensing some negative
vibes here, but I promise

364
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,975
tomorrow's freak-out
will go a lot smoother.

365
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,401
There won't be
any more freak-outs.

366
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,570
You're not a hippie
and you never were.

367
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,190
Yes, b--but the poncho?

368
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,236
Please, Homer,
just leave us alone.

369
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,419
How could you let me
turn into you?

370
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,459
B--but the poncho.

371
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,802
(mocking)
B--but the poncho!

372
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,338
Hit the road, square.

373
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,426
(grunts)

374
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,473
Uh-oh.

375
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,271
Oh!

376
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,019
Oh, for crying out loud!

377
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,522
Stunned league officials say
point-shaving may have occurred

378
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:27,317
in as many as three
Harlem Globetrotters games.

379
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,573
And in business news,
Groovy Grove Juice Corporation

380
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,946
has announced
it will miss delivery

381
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,372
on its third-quarter shipment.

382
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,330
A spokesman attributed
the production shutdown

383
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,081
to a half-witted oaf.

384
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,622
Ah, it was sweet of those guys
to blame an oaf,

385
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,838
but really, it was my fault.

386
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,548
I just don't have the discipline
to be a hippie.

387
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:48,339
Ooh, does this mean you're going
to start showering again?

388
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,184
Perhaps... in time.

389
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,799
Ah, cheer up, Dad.
You make a great hippie.

390
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,846
Ah, you're just saying that.

391
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,470
No, really. You're lazy
and self-righteous.

392
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,518
And the soles of your
feet are jet black.

393
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,981
Well, I do walk through
pretty much anything.

394
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,863
Oh, you kids are sweet.

395
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,570
I know you feel bad
about the juice incident,

396
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,651
but I'm sure you
can make up for it somehow.

397
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,607
That's it! Somehow!

398
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,497
Sleep, gentle hippies, sleep.

399
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,082

(both gasp)

408
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,794
What's going on?

409
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,160
What happened
to our crops?

410
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,616
I picked them, juiced them

411
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,496
and delivered them
to every store in town.

412
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,844
Your business is saved.

413
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,250

That's what I thought at first,

417
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,598
but then I found the other
garden behind the barn--

418
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,098
The one with
the camouflage netting.

419
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,521
Uh-oh.

420
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:25,229
Homer, those were
our personal vegetables.

421
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,152

It's nothing but carrots
and peyote.

458
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,421
Hmm. Damn long-hairs
never learn, Chief.

459
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,248
Yeah, it's time
for an old-fashioned

460
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,924
hippie ass-whomping.

461
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:12,922
(sirens waling)

462
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,009
Attention, hippies.

463
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,260
Come out peacefully

464
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,092
so we can smash your drug mill

465
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,097
and all your
worldly possessions.

466
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,679
Officer, please.

467
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,184
We can explain.

468
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,515
Not so fast, pig!

469
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,440
We're making a stand--
a freaky stand.

470
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,689
You can smash this drug barn
all you want,

471
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:36,112
but first you'll have to smash
our heads open like ripe melons.

472
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,493
This man does not represent us.

473
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,780
All right, boys.

474
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,323
Set your nightsticks on
"whomp."

475
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,793
Um, mine's stuck on "twirl."

476
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,039
Oh, for the love of... There.

477
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,041
Now, let's crack some skulls.

478
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,634
Seth, Munchie, they can destroy
our bodies and our ponchos,

479

Yes, he was lucky.

497
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,473
If that had been a gladiola,
he'd be dead right now.
