the nuclear plant.

176
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,585
Me?

177
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,553
Be strong, Smithers.

178
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,803
Be strong for the plant.

179
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,425
She needs you.

180
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,641
(metallic creaking)

181
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,391
<i>MR. BURNS:</i>
<i>This would have been a perfect</i>
<i>time for it to start raining.</i>

182
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,524
<i>Oh, what the hell.</i>
<i>I'm telling this story.</i>

183
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,982
(thunder crashing)

184
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,572
<i>Hmm. Not dramatic enough.</i>

185
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,105
<i>Frostbite took his nose.</i>

186
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,489
(Burns laughs):
<i>Excellent.</i>

187
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,736
<i>MR. BURNS: That prison</i>
<i>was like a prison to me.</i>

188
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,407
<i>Not a prison of bricks</i>
<i>and iron,</i>

189
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,786
<i>but one of steel and cement.</i>

190
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,253
<i>They took everything from me.</i>

191
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,963
One movie stub from
<i>Tillie's Punctured Romance,</i>

192
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,755
envelope marked "bribe."

193
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,219
Empty.

194
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,393
Social Security card.

195
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,060
That's just an S.S. card,
you <i>Dummkopf.</i>

196
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,939
<i>My only hope lay</i>
<i>in befriending the warden.</i>

197
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,728
(with Southern accent):
Now you looky here, Burns.

198
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,021
All your money and influence

199
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,734
don't mean nothin'
on the inside.

200
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,694
Yes, but a wealthy man
can buy information,

201
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,906
information that can be highly
damaging to a certain warden.

202
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,698
Well, uh, what information
we talkin' 'bout?

203
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,953
Well, I'm sure the boys
at the city desk

204
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,155
would be interested to learn
that you're addicted to...

205
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,407
to...

206
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,828
(chuckles)

207
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,746
Can't read my own writing.

208
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,554
But I'll tell you this, Warden,
it starts with an "H."

209
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,420
Ham?

210
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,126
It's clearly more
than three letters.

211
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,086
Get him out of my sight.

212
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,976
Ain't nobody gonna take my H
from me.

213
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,351
(inhales)

214
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,147
(high-pitched):
Damn, that gas is noble.

215
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,151
(blues music playing)

216
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,397
<i>♪ Early one morning ♪</i>

217
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,780
<i>♪ The blues came fallin' down ♪</i>

218
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,206
<i>♪ Early one morning ♪</i>

219
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,751
<i>♪ The blues came-- ♪</i>

220
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:45,844
(music stops abruptly)

221
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,668
Time for a cavity search.

222
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,593
(laughing):
Oh.

223
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,471
I haven't had a cavity
in over 40 years.

224
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,679
I wasn't talking
about your teeth.

225
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,469
Nor was I.

226
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,353
Meet your roommate.

227
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,519
Hiya, pal.
They put two harmless

228
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,063
white collar criminals
in the same cell.

229
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,266
What luck, huh?

230
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,765
(chuckling)

231
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,857
I was afraid you'd be
some tattooed bruiser.

232
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,362
Well, they don't turn out
too many of those at Dartmouth.

233
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,655
Dartmouth? Get me away from
this hideous brute at once.

234
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,280
At once! Do you hear me?

235
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,326
Got my master's from the
University of Virginia,

236
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,290
the public Ivy.

237
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,200
Guard!

238
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,457
Such an intricate formicarium.

239
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,631
I'm the proudest myrmecologist
on the block.

240
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,171
Hey, they're not eating.

241
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,005
Don't worry.
I gave 'em a Pop-Tart.

242
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,180
The healthy kind--
strawberry-frosted.

243
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:39,219
Bart, that Pop-Tart wasn't
locally farmed or sourced.

244
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,015
Oh, Lisa, you take the fun
out of everything.

245
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:44,518
(scoffs):
I am so glad
I am not your kid.

246
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,232
Well, I'm so glad
I'm not your mom.

247
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,152
You should be.

248
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,729
If I was in your tummy,
I'd poo in your throat.

249
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:53,185
Ew. Ew. Ew. I'll never get
that image out of my head.

250
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,657
Oh, no. You are not
taking the children.

251
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,368
If they're anybody's children,
they're mine.

252
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,039
(grunting)

253
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,328
(gasps):
Quick, we gotta get them back.

254
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,424
There's only one ant left.

255
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,134
I will
<i>never </i>forgive you.

256
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:16,876
Aw...

257
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,967
Well, <i>I </i>will
never forgive <i>you, </i>Bart.

258
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,764
That only angers me more!

259
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,887
-I know.
-(growls)

260
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,736
Okay, Waylon,
you never wanted this job,

261
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,281
but you got it.

262
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,199
Damn it!

263
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,079
(sighs)

264
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,999
You know, this is my chance.

265
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,421
A chance to be the kind of
boss <i>I </i>want to be.

266
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,461
A little more...
employee-friendly.

267
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,626
Mmm. That was
a wild Christmas party.

268
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,679
In the next few weeks,
we'll be introducing

269
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,600
a medical plan
that covers illness,

270
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,849
and a suggestion box
that is no longer

271
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,021
a guillotine for the hand.

272
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,059
(clanging)
Yeah!

273
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,153
Well, I agree things
are a lot nicer around here,

274
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,808
but I think I speak
for many of us when I say...

275
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:12,817
what's the catch?

276
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:13,818
(chuckles)

277
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,029
Well, the catch is,

278
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,279
happy workers
are productive workers.

279
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,491
(quietly):
There's always a catch!

280
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,454
Can I come in?

281
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,294
You're not going
anywhere near Annie.

282
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,539
Annie?

283
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,580
As in "Little Orphan"?

284
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,504
It was an accident--
I didn't mean to kill our ants.

285
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,544
(gasps):
Patty and Selma
are dead?

286
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,707
Whoo-hoo!

287
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,165
A double funeral!

288
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,965
(Homer singing lively tune)

289
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,590
Dad, before you
jump to conclusions...

290
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,257
Oh, please,
tell me they suffered.

291
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,135
(gasps)

292
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,851
Gh-gh-gh... hags!

293
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,063
(both groaning)

294
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,984
MR. BURNS:
Looks like it's Pledge Day.

295
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,783
Which jailhouse fraternity
shall I join?

296
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,738
The Shriners?

297
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,448
The ROTC?

298
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,198
The Sunday Funnies?

299
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,910
Or one of these other
dining clubs?

300
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,411
Look at them circling me
like I'm Cinderella,

301
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,044
belle of the ball.

302
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,370
MAN:
Back off!

303
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,745
He's mine.

304
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,788
Warden, help me!

305
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:15,627
(high-pitched):
No can do, baby.

306
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,421
I'm not coming down for days!

307
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,047
Mr. Smithers, our lives
are awesome, thanks to you.

308
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,215
And because I know you...
like your loafers light,

309
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,885
I want to give something back.

310
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:29,814
Wip!

311
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,059
Use that image
any way you want.

312
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,725
Three cheers
for Mr. Smithers!

313
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,024
To Mr. Smithers!

314
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,396
Hooray!
Hooray!
Hooray!

315
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,864
(chuckles)

316
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,574
Uh, listen,
uh, can I leave

317
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,954
a little early tomorrow?

318
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,820
My kid has a thing.

319
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,447
Ooh, yeah, can I
leave early, too?

320
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,204
I wanna take a nap so I'm
awake for the meteor shower.

321
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,828
Well, I'm flexible. Go ahead.

322
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,245
You know, I used
to think you was

323
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,173
just as bad as Mr. Burns.

324
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,252
Now, I think you're
just as good as me.

325
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,507
Oh, that is a
<i>huge </i>compliment.

326
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,049
(phone rings)

327
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,262
Uh, excuse me.

328
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,184
Yes, the service on my car
was excellent.

329
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,975
Five out of five.

330
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,388
Four out of five.

331
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,976
Five out of five.

332
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,691
Uh, excuse me, can I go back

333
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,021
and change that four out of five
to five out of five?

334
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,147
I'm wasting your time?

335
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,784
Smithers, what
a marshmallow.
I don't have

336
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,492
a thing with my
kid tomorrow.

337
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,032
You told me you did.

338
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,575
I do, but I'm not
going to it.

339
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,658
To Smithers,

340
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,622
the world's dumbest loser.

341
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,663
There's nothing
sweeter than being nice

342
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,956
to a guy's face and then
stabbing him in the back

343
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,250
the minute
he walks away.

344
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,253
All right, that's it.

345
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,335
-(gasping)
-You know,

346
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,510
I used to wonder
why Mr. Burns

347
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,879
hated humanity.

348
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,375
Now I know.

349
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:48,006
You open your heart
and they mock your very decency.

350
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,135
(mocking):
Ooh, we mock
your very decency.

351
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,274
(whimpers)

352
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:03,027
Man, Smithers is working us
like dogs.

353
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,900
Well, at least we got

354
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,736
the best brand
ceiling insulation.

355
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,454
(shrieks)

356
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,162
Well, at least we got
the best asbestos.

357
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,624
(groaning)

358
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:14,914
(buzzer rings)

359
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,577
I've told you,
you're mine.

360
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,375
And you can't escape the word

361
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,210
of Jesus Christ.

362
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,545
Burns, you shall
reject Satan.

363
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,301
Why can't you
reject your guy?

364
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,592
Because when I
was at my lowest

365
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,886
facing 50 years to life,

366
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,770
<i>someone handed me a book.</i>

367
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,768
<i>I couldn't read a lick,</i>

368
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,850
<i>but that picture of Jesus</i>

369
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,226
<i>gave me a comfort</i>
<i>I've never known.</i>

370
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,072
<i>So I promised the Lord</i>

371
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,109
I'd put that 50 years to use

372
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,403
reclaiming
lost souls like you.

373
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,778
Come to Jesus!

374
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,124
-Shan't.
-(thunder rumbles)

375
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,659
Feel his power!

376
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,622
I've died and come back--
it's overrated.

377
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,912
-Open your heart!
-(groaning)

378
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,286
(thunder rumbling)

379
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,383
I will suck out your evil.

380
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,538
(groaning)

381
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,167
(yelling)

382
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,591
And now, your evil is gone!

383
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:11,255
(chuckles) I'm afraid that
was just my pre-evil.

384
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,018
(thunder crashing)

385
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,942
I feel it.

386
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,403
I feel the love
coursing through my vein.

387
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,114
(chuckles)

388
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,864
Welcome to the Lord,
brother.

389
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,446
MR. BURNS:
<i>So, that hellhole</i>
<i>became a Heavenhole.</i>

390
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,622
<i>I joined the prison choir.</i>

391
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,831
<i>And the prison</i>
<i>Beatles' tribute band.</i>

392
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,291
<i>I raked a Zen garden</i>
<i>in the courtyard</i>

393
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:42,082
<i>and found a peace and serenity</i>
<i>I'd never known.</i>

394
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,513
(chuckles)

395
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,101
Who's carrying
50 times her weight?

396
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,719
-Ooh, you are.
-LISA: Bart?

397
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,307
She's only carrying
30 times her weight.

398
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,273
Our girl is slowing down.

399
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,983
Oh, my God.
That is so sad.

400
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,074
It's the natural
order of things.

401
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,030
I'm afraid she's
got another two,

402
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,280
maybe three days, tops.

403
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,952
Do we let her spend the rest
of her life in the wild?

404
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,202
Or let her die in captivity,
like Grampa?

405
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,584
Hey, in my mind
I'm free.

406
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,621
No you're not, ya idjit!

407
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,905
(groans)

408
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,924
It's official.

409
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,091
Smithers is now
worse than Mr. Burns.

410
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,300
Instead of releasing hounds,
he releases wolverines.

411
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,131
(snarling)

412
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,021
I never thought
I'd say this,

413
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,098
but I wish Mr. Burns
was back.

414
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,274
Hey, if wishes were
horses, I'd be eatin'

415
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,692
wish-meat every night.
What does that mean?

416
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,982
It means, it's not like you're
gonna break into the prison

417
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,436
and bust him out or anything.

418
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,317
Oh, hey, come on.
You can't really

419
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,454
be serious about
breaking him out.

420
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,081
It's too late
to turn back, Moe.

421
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,538
We've exchanged
meaningful looks.

422
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,119
No, you can still turn back.

423
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,874
The point of no return
is the whispered huddle.

424
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,495
(whispering)

425
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,042
Oh, God. Oh, God!

426
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,955
(thunder crashing)

427
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,891
-Burns, you're
coming with us.
-No.

428
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,849
No, let me go.

429
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,520
Why would I want
to leave the place

430
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,348
where my soul was saved?

431
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,653
<i>And that's where we came in.</i>

432
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,268
<i>Now, without further ado,</i>

433
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,355
<i>here's what happened next.</i>

434
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,240
<i>But first, I'll daydream</i>
<i>about a sport utility vehicle,</i>

435
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,658
<i>a crispy chicken sandwich</i>
<i>and a wonderful blue pill.</i>

436
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,249
MAN:
Hold it right there!

437
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,078
You're not leaving
with that man.

438
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,923
He's born again.

439
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,538
Been baptized in a toilet sink.

440
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,996
(quietly):
Everyone doesn't
have to know that part.

441
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,167
It's the specific
detail that shows

442
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,796
the humbling
you've undergone.

443
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,432
-You don't have
a "whisper" voice, do you?
-What?

444
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,925
Good-bye, Annie,
my eight-legged friend.

445
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,564
Ants have six legs, Bart.

446
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,021
Oh, thank God.

447
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,231
I thought I broke two off.

448
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,021
You're just a tiny ant,
but you were strong enough

449
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,896
to pull my brother
and me together.

450
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,073
Now go and be free.

451
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,250
Look, if I leave with you,

452
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,248
they're just going
to throw me back in.

453
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,960
The world has changed
since you went in.

454
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,960
Men of wealth
can beat the system now.

455
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,712
Yeah, and they've replaced
parking meters

456
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,884
with this thing you stick
your credit card into.

457
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,263
The war is over
and the future won.

458
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,090
The past never
had a chance, man.

459
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,597
Do you really want to
leave with these idiots?

460
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,179
I'm afraid so.

461
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,387
But I cleansed you
of your evil.

462
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,807
I had a little left
between my toes.

463
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,937
It quickly multiplied, and now
I'm a bigger bastard than ever.

464
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,395
But I must know,

465
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,404
what was it about me
that made you try?

466
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,316
Because I've killed
so many rich white men,

467
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,776
I thought I'd do right
by at least one.

468
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,407
We're not so different,
you and I.

469
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,754
(both chuckling)

470
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,330
Get your skinny
ass out of here.

471
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,375
Lollygags,
slackabouts,

472
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,919
Captain Happys--
you're all fired.

473
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,173
I'll do the firing
around here.

474
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,165
Mr. Burns!

475
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,297
You're even more beautiful
than I remembered.

476
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,011
All of you,
out of my office.

477
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,154
(sighs)

478
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,523
Farewell, friend.

479
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,898
Maybe you'll find another
lost lamb for your flock.

480
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:41,866
Tell me, brother, have you heard
the story of Jesus Christ?

481
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:46,039
Well, I am Italian, but no.
