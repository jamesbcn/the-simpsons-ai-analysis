1
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:09,510
Am I the only one who remembered
daylight savings time?

2
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:27,094
Been here 17 years.

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,730
Been on the HBO, the Netflix

4
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:31,665
and one House Hunters
International.

5
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:35,502
But now I got two new hotshot
lawyers working my case.

6
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:39,306
No sign of a struggle,
no DNA evidence in the cabin

7
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:42,442
and no attractive young woman
declared missing.

8
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,647
I think there's a very real
chance no one was murdered.

9
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,353
I was on the jury
that convicted him.

10
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,188
Had we known
there was no victim,

11
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,723
we might not have voted guilty.

12
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,926
I repeat, might not.

13
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,461
Fantastic news.

14
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:03,130
We got picked up
for a second season.

15
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,398
And my appeal?

16
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,600
Mostly to women 25 to 54.

17
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,635
You mean appeal appeal.

18
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:10,504
Oh, well, that's not happenin.

19
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,821
What is it, sweetie?
Are you gassy?

20
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:30,123
When is she not gassy?

21
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,992
Baby burn.

22
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,194
If only you could talk.

23
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,998
It's the people who can't speak
that have so much to share.

24
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,404
Or maybe not.

25
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,707
Wait a minute.
I think there's a show

26
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,943
about teaching a baby
sign language.

27
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,920
I could finally talk to my baby.

28
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:04,224
Maggie, we have a fun week
of repetitive drills ahead.

29
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,760
I wonder what the kid
was so upset about.

30
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:10,664
Don't worry, little baby.

31
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,767
I'll be okay till morning.

32
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,538
Now I'm screwed.

33
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:23,543
Congratulations, babies, we've
learned some great signs today.

34
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,749
I hope you don't want more,
because we're all done,

35
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,753
because our government funding
ran out.

36
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,721
Okay, Maggie.

37
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:39,459
Do you want more
or are you all done?

38
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:42,896
More or all done?

39
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:45,766
More or all done?

40
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,702
More or all done?

41
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,071
More or all done?

42
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:53,740
More or all done?

43
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,642
More or all done?

44
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,778
More or all done?

45
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,812
More or all done?

46
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,314
Oh, great,
now I'm out of Cheerios.

47
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,585
Oh, I thought
they were doughnuts

48
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,721
that were really far away.

49
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,523
More?

50
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,758
More? Aw, that's 22.

51
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,427
You busted.

52
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,729
Always say all done
on a hard 17.

53
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:18,699
Can you say that? Hard 17?

54
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,200
Don't teach her gambling.

55
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,369
Let's go, dealer. One more hand.

56
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,571
Aw, sir, I don't want
to take your money.

57
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,576
Remember to make sure
that the warriors you kill

58
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,111
are actually dead.

59
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,380
I recommend stabbing,
dissolving in acid,

60
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,082
dynamite in the butt...

61
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,851
Jason. You're late for dinner!

62
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,587
Ma, I'm talking
to 30 million people!

63
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:44,257
Boil them, let pigs eat them,
Kentucky-fry them...

64
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,661
Don't play that in front of Maggie.
She'll have nightmares.

65
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,429
Suit yourself.

66
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,198
This is more like it.

67
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:54,634
Hansel shoved the blood-covered
witch into the oven.

68
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:58,004
I'm burning alive,
screamed the witch.

69
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,041
More? More?

70
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,043
You want more book?

71
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,813
My baby's communicating with me.

72
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,183
Let me test it out.
Do you like peas?

73
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,252
Do you like applesauce?

74
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,256
Do you like Star Wars movies?

75
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,825
What about Baby Yoda?

76
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:28,034
This is so exciting.
Look, look what Maggie can do.

77
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,472
Maggie, do you want more?

78
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:33,707
That's my girl.

79
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,009
Look, everyone. She's doing it.

80
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,978
Yeah, that's great.

81
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,813
Dad, check this out.

82
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,648
He only sings
when we're not looking.

83
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,683
Classic aggravation humor.

84
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,019
A dancing frog.

85
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:47,754
Bet that would cook up nice.

86
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:50,223
You're missing a crucial moment
in Maggie's development

87
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,725
because of these.

88
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,727
From now on,
we're gonna limit the time

89
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,897
we spend looking
at our stupid phones.

90
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,501
Yeah, that's great.

91
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:04,704
And then we'll have
a conversation.

92
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,810
Steve Jobs wouldn't let
his children use his iPads,

93
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:13,013
and he was a great parent,
I assume.

94
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,550
From now on, everyone gets a
half hour of screen time a week.

95
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,585
- And that's it.
- Really, Marge?

96
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,988
You think you can give up
your Pinterest?

97
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,990
My cake fails are important.

98
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:28,061
If people fail at cake,
they need to be told.

99
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,565
Okay. Half an hour a week

100
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,767
for everyone, including me.

101
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:37,070
I believe there's something
you're forgetting.

102
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:42,342
And? And?

103
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,945
No more screens. You too.

104
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,085
Here at Messages, we treat
your addiction humanely,

105
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:55,622
with hiking and biking and
human equivalents of things

106
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,425
that work with rats.

107
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:02,362
And all we ask for
is your brain when you die.

108
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,831
Well, let's pray this place
won't be necessary.

109
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:08,668
All right, let's round 'em up.

110
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,670
Okay. It's been one week.

111
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,106
Let me check your screen times.

112
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,445
They're really low.

113
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,947
I'm so proud of you.

114
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:24,451
I forgot how great it was
to crack the spine of a book.

115
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,154
I'm calmer, I'm happier,

116
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,724
I'm seeing things
I never saw before.

117
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,927
Did you know our second dog
is a cat?

118
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,967
Sorry, last time I was here,

119
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,670
I left my screen time
reversal wrench.

120
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,472
I could just get that back.

121
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,276
You guys have been having this
man dial back your screen time?

122
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:52,412
Oops. Looks like
I just lost a contract.

123
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,980
Well, anybody want to buy a van?

124
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:57,450
It only has two miles on it.

125
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,120
What the...?

126
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,622
Okay, close your eyes.

127
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:06,660
I'm putting these someplace
you'll never find them.

128
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:25,278
No cell phone. Stuck at work
all day with nothing to do.

129
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:26,880
Lookin' at my feet.

130
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,815
Hey, big guy.
What, are you bored?

131
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,850
Why don't you do
the Daily Jumble in the paper?

132
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,219
Unscramble the words
to solve a funny riddle.

133
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,654
Oh, that's what it is.

134
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,157
I thought the proofreader
had a stroke.

135
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,158
Let's see.

136
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,728
D-D-A.

137
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,864
D-D-A.

138
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,868
D-D-A.

139
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,203
Dad.

140
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,405
Dad. I got something!

141
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,709
For the first time ever,
I solved a puzzle.

142
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:19,666
Dad ate all the pie.

143
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,402
Call the newspaper.
Tell them someone has solved it.

144
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:23,903
And get me some pie.

145
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,706
I love not using a phone.

146
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,376
It's made me much more
in tune with the world.

147
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,412
It's like my senses
are heightened.

148
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,520
Okay, Maggie, time to go.

149
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,422
Say goodbye to your aunts.

150
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,394
So cute.

151
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,895
What's she saying?

152
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:56,503
She always sleeps so good
when she's here.

153
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,849
Careful. If we enter
the Martian atmosphere

154
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,951
at too steep an angle,
we'll burn up.

155
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:17,257
Tell my family I love them.

156
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,625
They know that, Steve.

157
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:19,626
They know.

158
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:24,731
Bart has to use
his imagination.

159
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,634
This is Jupiter One.
Do you copy?

160
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,202
I copy.

161
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,570
What are you doing?

162
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,372
I'm talking to Jupiter One.

163
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,608
Oh, I'll show you Jupiter One.

164
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,610
Jupiter One to mission control.

165
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,513
Firing photon torpedoes.

166
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:48,421
I'm doing a very important
two-page paper.

167
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:52,425
Do you have any way to find a
book without using a computer?

168
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,161
Well, the old card catalogue
is in the basement.

169
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,430
Bang on this pot to scare
the possums away.

170
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:58,731
Okay.

171
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,842
Old card stock.

172
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,844
So tactile.

173
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:18,685
Look, this one
has an old handwritten note.

174
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,521
Dear Reader...
Ooh, that's me.

175
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:24,858
See also, Lost Wax Technique.

176
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,494
I will see also.

177
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,698
N-J-X-I.

178
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,500
Jinx.

179
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:37,036
P-I-U-Q. Quip.

180
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,038
I'm solving words
I don't even know.

181
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,441
<i>Jumble boogie,
doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo</i>

182
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,710
<i>Get down, get down</i>

183
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,045
<i>With the goobie,
doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo</i>

184
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,448
<i>Unjumbled that is boogie</i>

185
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,450
<i>Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo,
solve a jumble</i>

186
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:52,919
<i>In your face, world,
I'm so humble</i>

187
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,388
<i>Now, watch me twirl</i>

188
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,092
Okay, okay.

189
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,927
I need the recipe
for puttanesca sauce.

190
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,695
Can't go online.

191
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:03,763
No problem.

192
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,732
I've got cookbooks.

193
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,101
Padma Lakshmi's Hot and Zesty.

194
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,171
Tiffany Haddish's
Fun with Radishes.

195
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,606
I made 14 of those,
they weren't that fun.

196
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,742
I know who to call.

197
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,211
Hello?

198
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,914
What's the recipe
for puttanesca sauce?

199
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,282
Oh, you want-a the recipe?

200
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,917
Sure, sure, get a pencil.

201
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,785
Step-a one, you come here.

202
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,720
Step-a two,
you pay for it.

203
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,223
Step-a three,
I put it on-a some pasta.

204
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,592
And that's-a the recipe!

205
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,735
Oh, what a great day.

206
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,637
Oh, you said it.

207
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,907
I spent five minutes today
just looking at the sun.

208
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,813
Hey, where's Mom?

209
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,616
And why do I hear clicking
from this closet?

210
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,087
Hold on a beat.

211
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,422
Just hold on.

212
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,592
Who was the one who said
no screen time?

213
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:06,726
Who?

214
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,162
It was you.

215
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,064
I know.

216
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,632
I have a problem.

217
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,234
So, I'm signing us
all up for a month

218
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,836
at that screen addiction
rehab center.

219
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,772
But we're not addicted, you are!

220
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,674
That's exactly
what an addict would say.

221
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,843
Or a normal person.

222
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,878
That's also what
an addict would say.

223
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,615
Well, what
wouldn't an addict say?!

224
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,617
Not that, that's for sure.

225
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,619
We'll all go there
starting tomorrow.

226
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,053
And I'll watch the pets.

227
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,989
I brought a bunch
of them inside.

228
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:38,891
I'm the beta.

229
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,665
Are we there yet?

230
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,667
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

231
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:48,835
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

232
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,070
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

233
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,873
- Are we there yet?
- Knock off that racket!

234
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,910
I said knock it off!

235
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,048
Mom's got the problem.

236
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,716
How come we're stuck in...

237
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,351
paradise?

238
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:08,354
Oh, Zen gardens, infinity pool?

239
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,523
Dr. Drew on call?

240
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,659
I'm just here because
I can't stop Fruit Ninja.

241
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,694
Die, mangoes, die!

242
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,500
If this is an addiction center,
I'm hooked.

243
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,834
Welcome to Messages.

244
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,170
I am Dr. Lund.

245
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:25,638
Doc, this prison is great.

246
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:28,074
Nothing but the best
for my family.

247
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,742
I just have one question.

248
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:33,446
How much does this place cost?

249
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,882
Your stay is entirely
funded by donations

250
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,785
from tech billionaires,
who feel guilty

251
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,722
that their sleek, disruptive
technology put you here.

252
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,791
It's free?

253
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,960
Kids, we've found
our summer home.

254
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,763
The adults will
reconnect with healthier,

255
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,266
time-tested alternatives

256
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,768
like eating,
drinking, fornicating,

257
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,771
relentless hide-and-seek,
the braiding of hair,

258
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,641
listening
to Dana Gould's podcast.

259
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:05,211
Four people suffocated in the
Creature from the Black Lagoon's

260
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,847
suit until they got it right.
At least,

261
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,116
I'm guessing that's true.

262
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,786
And you, young man, instead of
playing first-person shooters,

263
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,990
we are going to put
a real rifle in your hands.

264
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,061
Take that, Second Amendment!

265
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,567
It's time to start
healing, Marge.

266
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,135
I love your accent.

267
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,204
I didn't know I had one.

268
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,940
This is our one computer,
on which you can say

269
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:37,777
auf wiedersehen forever
to your old online life.

270
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:41,581
Farewell, Instagram,
Facebook and NextDoor.

271
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,150
You all entertained me
and scared me.

272
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,918
Yes, Marge, yes.

273
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,421
Cut forever the puppet strings
that have made you

274
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,957
dance like
a psychotic Pinocchio.

275
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,259
Facebook accounts
cannot be deleted.

276
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:56,429
Do not try. Do not try.

277
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,631
What is wrong, Homer?

278
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,566
Why the pickle puss?

279
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:04,437
I don't know if I can live in a
world without online solitaire.

280
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:05,638
I have an answer for you.

281
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,206
It's sealed.

282
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,841
I will open the plastic.

283
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,843
The box is shut.

284
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,512
I will open the box.

285
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,679
Could you...?

286
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,615
I will deal the cards.

287
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,017
- And also...?
- I will play the solitaire!

288
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,489
I need a jack, I need a jack.

289
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,825
I used my phone for everything.

290
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,660
Except to call the parents
who gave it to me.

291
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:30,663
You can call them now.

292
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,598
Hello, Dad?

293
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,768
You don't say.
You don't say.

294
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,837
You don't say.

295
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,005
What did he say?

296
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,106
He hates me.

297
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,008
Okay, okay. Let's just talk.

298
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,744
Any subject...
except video games.

299
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,748
A tear rolled down my face,

300
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:51,651
as my avatar did the electric
shuffle on her corpse.

301
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:52,919
Yes!

302
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,854
That game is awesome!

303
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,823
I'm losing control,
but that's all right.

304
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,559
Today's therapist has
many effective options.

305
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,767
The gas is never a good sign.

306
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:12,038
I have to say,
all this talk about no devices

307
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,307
has really made me
want my phone.

308
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,310
I know, I was talking with
some guys about the weather,

309
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,545
and I realized I have no idea

310
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,647
what the temperature is
in Cupertino.

311
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,649
- I need my phone.
- Me too.

312
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,486
What if Krusty posted a tweet?!
I must retweet!

313
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,721
- I must retweet! I must retweet!
- I need my phone!

314
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,523
- I need my phone!
- Must retweet, must retweet!

315
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,859
- Must retweet, must retweet!
- I need my phone!

316
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,727
- Must retweet!
- I need my phone!

317
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:37,396
We can't leave!

318
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:40,566
Studies show tech is more
addictive than heroin.

319
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:43,069
Google and TikTok
say that's a lie.

320
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,871
We have to be cured.

321
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,907
You couldn't be
more wrong, Marge.

322
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:50,710
You couldn't be more wrong.

323
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:54,380
Since this nation was founded,
families have faced the problem

324
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:57,884
of staying together without
driving each other crazy.

325
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,086
For the first 200 years,
they played fiddle music

326
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,587
until they had a war.

327
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,356
It was a good system.

328
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,691
Then, they came up
with sitting around a radio.

329
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,694
But without a screen, they still
had time to look at each other.

330
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,697
So World War II.

331
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:15,167
With peace came TV, which bought
Silicon Valley the time

332
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:18,838
to invent the devices
that isolate us completely.

333
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:22,608
Finally, the American family
was safe...

334
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,644
from itself.

335
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,746
Is any of that true?

336
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,614
Once I post it on Reddit,

337
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,650
it will be.

338
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,285
Okay, we'll just say goodbye

339
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,253
and then we'll get our things.

340
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,489
What's going on here?

341
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,458
I thought this was
a screen-free environment.

342
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,127
It is, for the patients.

343
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,597
But the rest of us have
side hustles to perpetrate.

344
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,800
I'm making $400
a day from home.

345
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,769
Want to know how?

346
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,805
You're sending that spam
through my e-mail account?

347
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:56,042
You stole her password
when she checked in!

348
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:59,845
Unlike every other rehab,
this one is a scam!

349
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,982
And we're gonna
expose you to the world!

350
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,417
I'm afraid not.

351
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,052
You signed a contract.

352
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:10,423
And every exit is guarded
by a laser-detection system.

353
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,625
You have lasers
at a rehab center?

354
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:16,862
Let me remind you,
this is an evil rehab center.

355
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,896
Anyone order a ride
from Jupiter One?

356
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,766
I'm riding in a spaceship.

357
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,970
Stick that spammer
in the darkest,

358
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:33,205
dankest cell we've got, Lou.

359
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,940
The one furthest from the Wi-Fi.

360
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,709
One bar, scumbag.

361
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,678
One bar is all I need

362
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,913
to scramble
your Spotify suggestions.

363
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,582
Hope you like Little River Band.

364
00:19:58,931 --> 00:19:59,899
No, no!

365
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:03,803
Please, turn the siren on.

366
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,005
Much better.

367
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,611
Only 12 doughnuts for three cops,
well, there's no way

368
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,181
to divide them evenly,
so I'll just eat them all.

369
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,816
Captain Wiggum,

370
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,785
I could help you
with your food addiction.

371
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,454
What do you mean?

372
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,356
Psychologically,
you are a baby with a gun,

373
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,525
sticking food in his mouth.

374
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:30,162
Eat, eat, eat, all the day,
like a schwein.

375
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,697
Wow, you are such
a great profiler.

376
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,767
With you, we wouldn't
even need DNA evidence.

377
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,535
Boy, so sick
of getting criminals

378
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,370
to give semen samples.

379
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,206
Chief, you don't need semen.

380
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,874
A lock of hair will do.

381
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,642
It what?!
