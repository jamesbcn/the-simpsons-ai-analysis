00:00:05,746 --> 00:00:08,182
[thunder rumbling]

00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,133
[panting]

3
00:00:17,134 --> 00:00:20,775
Finally, a galaxy
without trolls.

4
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:22,177
Huh?

5
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:27,287
[both grunting]

6
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,836
Your reign of muscly heroism

7
00:00:34,837 --> 00:00:37,473
ends here, Flexulon.

8
00:00:37,474 --> 00:00:38,843
[screeching]

9
00:00:38,844 --> 00:00:41,282
[shouts]

10
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:44,722
[groans]

11
00:00:44,723 --> 00:00:47,026
Soar high, my golden friend.

12
00:00:47,027 --> 00:00:50,433
For today, we die another day.

13
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:52,705
[laughing]

14
00:00:52,706 --> 00:00:55,678
[rock guitar solo plays]

15
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:59,384
[laughs] Next stop,

16
00:00:59,385 --> 00:01:02,924
the dank sticky jungles
of Bong-ulon Five.

17
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:05,163
- [tires screeching]
- [laughing]

18
00:01:05,164 --> 00:01:06,899
Dude, you shouldn't have
let him eat

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,037
that whole pan of acid brownies.

20
00:01:09,038 --> 00:01:11,509
In my defense,
I-I thought it'd be cool,

21
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,516
and I was right.

22
00:01:16,419 --> 00:01:20,059
So, since Otto has disappeared
with our bus

23
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,896
and our brownie pans,

24
00:01:21,897 --> 00:01:24,635
parents will have to drive
their own children to school.

25
00:01:24,636 --> 00:01:28,009
[overlapping complaints]

26
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,179
Well, fewer of you
would have to drive

27
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,951
if you sat down and arranged
a carpool schedule.

28
00:01:32,952 --> 00:01:34,989
[clamoring]

29
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,192
[parent]
I'll kill you!

30
00:01:36,193 --> 00:01:38,095
Or your children could walk
to school

31
00:01:38,096 --> 00:01:40,132
so none of you
have to do anything.

32
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,969
[overlapping agreements]

33
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,172
Walking it is.

34
00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:45,911
However, we do need
one parent volunteer

35
00:01:45,912 --> 00:01:47,113
to complete our team of

36
00:01:47,114 --> 00:01:49,251
noble crossing guards.

37
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:53,392
Just, uh, one engaged parent
is all we need.

38
00:01:53,393 --> 00:01:55,096
[overlapping grumbling]

39
00:01:55,097 --> 00:01:57,166
Hell yeah! You know I'm in.

40
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,704
I've been waiting for this
my whole life.

41
00:01:58,705 --> 00:02:01,308
Homer Simpson. Wonderful.

42
00:02:01,309 --> 00:02:02,911
Hmm? What'd he say?

43
00:02:02,912 --> 00:02:05,851
I was watching the trailer for
the <i>Revenge of the Nerds</i> reboot.

44
00:02:05,852 --> 00:02:08,055
John Cena is playing Booger.

45
00:02:08,056 --> 00:02:11,563
Homer, you just volunteered.

46
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,699
Dear God.

47
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,436
No. Stop. Yield.

48
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:19,010
Well, he's got the lingo down.
This guy's a natural.

49
00:02:19,011 --> 00:02:20,079
[bird caws]

50
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,081
Now I got to wake up

51
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:22,752
at the butt-crack of dawn

52
00:02:22,753 --> 00:02:25,957
to walk loser kids
across some loser street.

53
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,763
[groans]
Never have children, Lenny.

54
00:02:28,764 --> 00:02:31,235
[laughs] You don't have to
worry about that.

55
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:33,472
- See, I was born without...
- [alert beeping]

56
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:36,645
What the...? We've got a code
blue in 7-G. Repeat, code blue.

57
00:02:36,646 --> 00:02:39,250
[alarm blaring]

58
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:40,453
[groans] Anyhoo,

59
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:43,392
you notice there's an apple
for sale in the vending machine?

60
00:02:43,393 --> 00:02:46,031
[laughs] I mean,
who would buy that?

61
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,768
[alarm continues blaring]

62
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:50,674
- Double the coolant levels, now.
- I'm on it.

63
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:52,210
Backup pumps on standby.

64
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:53,814
Carlson, decrease
the steam valves by 60P.

65
00:02:53,815 --> 00:02:56,017
Leonard, the control rods.

66
00:02:56,018 --> 00:02:58,389
You, glasses,
pray for all our souls.

67
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,961
Now, switch generators
on my count.

68
00:03:00,962 --> 00:03:02,430
Five.

69
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:03,465
Four.

70
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:05,838
Three.

71
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:07,708
Two.

72
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:09,778
Implement.

73
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:11,650
[powering down]

74
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,087
[laughter]

75
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:16,559
- We did it!
- Boolah, boolah.

76
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,727
[clears throat] Um, fellas?

77
00:03:17,728 --> 00:03:21,569
I'm the nuclear safety guy, right?

78
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,409
Shouldn't my console have been
doing all that beepy stuff?

79
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,482
- Yeah, um, uh... [stammers]
- Uh, you see...

80
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:30,954
We kind of made it so that
just my console does that now.

81
00:03:30,955 --> 00:03:34,895
We just figured
we'd lighten your load, buddy,

82
00:03:34,896 --> 00:03:36,866
since you already do so much.

83
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:37,803
Like the March Madness brackets.

84
00:03:37,804 --> 00:03:41,174
And you're the go-getter
who implemented

85
00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:41,943
jean-short Wednesdays.

86
00:03:43,815 --> 00:03:45,584
Are you guys saying

87
00:03:45,585 --> 00:03:47,954
I've never kept anyone safe?

88
00:03:47,955 --> 00:03:51,696
Oh, sure you have, Homer.
Just... by not doing anything.

89
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:00,312
My console isn't even
plugged in.

90
00:04:00,313 --> 00:04:02,885
I opened it, and it's full
of cleaning supplies

91
00:04:02,886 --> 00:04:05,691
and unsold Mr. Burns Funkos.

92
00:04:05,692 --> 00:04:08,897
[groans] This whole time
I thought I mattered,

93
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:11,068
but I don't and I never did.

94
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:12,170
Well, you matter to me,

95
00:04:12,171 --> 00:04:15,544
especially since
it's Wednesday night.

96
00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:19,918
Oh. Right. Scheduled sex.

97
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,589
[both moaning]

98
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,762
[Homer]
Okay, here we go...

99
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:27,568
Just give me a second here.
[moans] Come on, just...

100
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:30,439
Almost... [grunts] Um...

101
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,876
[Marge]
Uh, sweetie?

102
00:04:31,877 --> 00:04:35,249
It seems like your light saber
doesn't want to go "shwoom."

103
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,155
Did you go "Han Solo"
earlier tonight?

104
00:04:38,156 --> 00:04:41,194
[groans] I guess
I'm useless everywhere.

105
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:42,798
I'm just gonna
stay in bed tomorrow

106
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:45,804
and suck my nightstand
ketchup packets.

107
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:49,879
Actually, you have to
wake up at 6:00

108
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,615
to be a crossing guard.

109
00:04:50,616 --> 00:04:52,384
D'oh!

110
00:04:52,385 --> 00:04:54,956
What do you guys think
happened to Otto?

111
00:04:54,957 --> 00:04:56,091
- Jail.
- Jail.

112
00:04:56,092 --> 00:04:58,162
- Jail.
- Maybe he just got tired

113
00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:00,099
of always running
from the darkness.

114
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,272
Oh, God, there's Dad.

115
00:05:03,273 --> 00:05:05,777
Please don't let him
embarrass us.

116
00:05:05,778 --> 00:05:07,247
Well, well,

117
00:05:07,248 --> 00:05:10,988
time to help the baby brigade
cross the road.

118
00:05:10,989 --> 00:05:12,524
[laughter]

119
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,562
- [groans]
- Oh, no.

120
00:05:14,563 --> 00:05:18,101
I deserve your respect,

121
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:20,006
you little jerks.

122
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,879
Stupid kids. Without me,

123
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,051
they'd be stuck
on one side of the street

124
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:27,788
for the rest of their lives.

125
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:30,492
Haw-haw!
Got your octagonal sign.

126
00:05:30,493 --> 00:05:32,464
Hey, give me that!

127
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,801
I need it to tell cars
what to do. Stop!

128
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:36,471
No, you stop.

129
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:38,577
- [laughs]
- D'oh!

130
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:40,981
- [laughter]
- [grunts]

131
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:45,490
I'm a streetwalker.

132
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:50,033
Oh, no. I'm late
for my AA meeting.

133
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:53,574
Hey there, gorgeous.

134
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:54,976
Hmm?

135
00:05:58,182 --> 00:05:59,151
[grunts]

136
00:06:00,453 --> 00:06:01,689
[both] Whoa.

137
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,561
My whole life just flashed
through my pants.

138
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:05,930
Way to go, Homer!

139
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:08,870
You just saved this
balding little scamp's life.

140
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:11,675
- All right, Homer.
- You did it, Dad!

141
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:13,880
How about one
for the paper, Mr. S.

142
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:17,053
I saved someone's life.

143
00:06:17,054 --> 00:06:17,889
You hear that, world?

144
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,459
Homer Simpson matters!

145
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,329
[overlapping shouting]

146
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,535
Oh, right.
How about one of these?

147
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:26,973
- Whoo.
- Whee!

148
00:06:26,974 --> 00:06:28,577
[grunting rhythmically]

149
00:06:31,382 --> 00:06:33,052
The last two endangered pandas

150
00:06:33,053 --> 00:06:35,924
on Earth died today

151
00:06:35,925 --> 00:06:37,895
in what zoo investigators are
calling a grisly murder-suicide.

152
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:41,001
<i>Adios, pandas. We'll see you
at the crossroads.</i>

153
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:43,706
We wrap up tonight's
nightly reading of horrors

154
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:46,144
with a new optimistic segment
I like to call

155
00:06:46,145 --> 00:06:48,181
<i>"Chicken Soup for the News."</i>

156
00:06:48,182 --> 00:06:50,920
<i>The small-town crossing guard.</i>

157
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:52,256
<i>[chuckles]</i>

158
00:06:52,257 --> 00:06:55,597
<i>A job most Americans consider
as charming as it is pointless.</i>

159
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:56,633
<i>Until last week,</i>

160
00:06:56,634 --> 00:06:59,771
<i>when local hero Homer Simpson
risked his life</i>

161
00:06:59,772 --> 00:07:01,809
<i>to save one pumpkin-headed
little boy.</i>

162
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,682
<i>And now,
Simpson has become something</i>

163
00:07:04,683 --> 00:07:06,084
<i>of a curbside celebrity.</i>

164
00:07:06,085 --> 00:07:09,792
What can Springfield do to show
its love and appreciation

165
00:07:09,793 --> 00:07:11,327
for local crossing guards?

166
00:07:11,328 --> 00:07:14,300
I don't know. I guess we could
use some new equipment.

167
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,104
These lawn chairs
aren't very comfy

168
00:07:16,105 --> 00:07:18,977
and these old sashes don't
exactly "lift and support."

169
00:07:18,978 --> 00:07:19,880
But you know what, Kent?

170
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:23,218
Keeping kids safe
is its own reward.

171
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:25,990
God bless that
saintly doughball.

172
00:07:25,991 --> 00:07:28,428
That's it, I'm giving
Springfield's crossing guards

173
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:29,832
an actual budget.

174
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,771
Not for self-serving
political reasons,

175
00:07:32,772 --> 00:07:33,840
but because I'm a man
of principle

176
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:35,844
who wants to do good
in the world.

177
00:07:35,845 --> 00:07:38,850
Joseph, your turn
on the sex chess board.

178
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:41,623
We can't very well play
without our king.

179
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:45,162
Though the bishop may try.
