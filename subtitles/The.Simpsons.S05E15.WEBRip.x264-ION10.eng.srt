came back superintelligent.

athletic go-getters.

175
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,716
Thank you. I'm afraid
that's all we have time for.

176
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,389
Now, of course,
only one of you

177
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,437
will be chosen
to go into space.

178
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,151
So the next few weeks will be
a grueling series of tests

179
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,992
to determine which one
of you is most qualified.

180
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,198
Oh, and, Mr. Gumble, for
the duration of the training,

181
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,659
there'll be no more beer.

182
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,409
What? Three whole weeks
with only wine?

183
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:16,372
-I'll go crazy!
-And may the best man win.

184
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,464
He's got a big drinking problem.
Could embarrass the program.

185
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,749
Meet me up in that tree later,
and I'll tell you more.

186
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,253
Wow, my father,
an astronaut.

187
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,127
I feel so full of--

188
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,335
-What's the opposite of shame?
-Pride?

189
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,465
No, not that
far from shame.

190
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,432
-Less shame?
-Yeah.

191
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,313
You know, Homer,
when I found out about this,

192
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,730
I went through
a wide range of emotions.

193
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:42,519
First I was nervous,
then anxious, then wary,

194
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,685
then apprehensive,
then kind of sleepy,

195
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,646
then worried
and then concerned.

196
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,567
But now I realize
that being a spaceman

197
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,116
is something you have to do.

198
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,159
Who's doing what now?

199
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,196
Well, here I am,
right on time. I don't see...

made me stop drinking,

you're both winners.

Homer, when I met you,
you weren't an astronaut.

You didn't even know how
to use a touch-tone.

and I always will,
no matter what.

But on the other hand, when you don't
take advantage of an opportunity,

you can end up regretting it
for the rest of your life.

You're right, Marge.

Just like the time I could've
met Mr. T. at the mall.

I'll go a little later."

And then when I got there,
they told me he just left.

288
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,235
And when I asked a mall guy
if he would ever come back again,

289
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,535
he said he didn't know.

290

I had Art Garfunkel come by
