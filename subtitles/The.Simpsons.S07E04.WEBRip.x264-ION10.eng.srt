Bart, come with me

You, too, snitchy.

40
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,194
Now I want you to clean every

00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,747
Well, I didn't want hungry
birds pecking my soul forever.

46
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:54,046
Soul? Come on, Milhouse,
there's no such thing as a soul.

47
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,012
It's just something
they made up to scare kids

48
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,222
like the bogeyman
or Michael Jackson.

49
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,763
But every religion
says there's a soul, Bart.

50
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,217
Why would they lie?

51
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,307
What would
they have to gain?

52
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,346
I don't hear scrubbing.

53
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,517
Well, if your soul's real,
where is it?

54
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,566
It's kind of in here.

55
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:12,979
And when you sneeze

56
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,067
that's your soul
trying to escape.

57
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,573
Saying "God bless you"
crams it back in.

58
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,525
And when you die,
it squirms out and flies away.

59
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,737
{\an8}Uh-huh. What if you die
in a submarine

60
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:23,787
{\an8}at the bottom
of the ocean?

61
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,080
Oh, it can swim.

62
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,504
It's even got wheels in case
you die in the desert

63
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,293
and it has to drive
to the cemetery.

64

{\an8}How can someone with glasses
that thick be so stupid?

65
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,763
Listen, you don't have a soul,
I don't have a soul.

66
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,550
There's no such thing

00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,755

about that

69
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,392
why don't you sell
your soul to me?

70
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,814
How much you got?

71
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,442
-Five bucks.
-Deal.

You ain't thinking of getting
rid of the dank, are you, Moe?

94
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,326
Ah, maybe I am.

95
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,660
But, Moe, the dank, the dank.

96
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,995

the big bucks are.

98

to bring your family, huh?

100
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,303
I'm not ashamed.

111
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,588

five bucks?

113

114
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,761

115

What? How could you
do that?

116
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,595
Your soul is the most
valuable part of you.

117
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,562

that junk?

118
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,982
Well, whether or not the soul
is physically real, Bart,

119
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,823
it's the symbol of everything
fine inside us.

120
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,279
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

Bart, your soul is the only
part of you that lasts forever.

123
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,953
For five dollars,

124
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,413
Milhouse could own you
for a zillion years.

125
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,334
Well, if you think
he got such a good deal,

126
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,582
I'll sell you my
conscience for 4.50.

127
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,464
I'll throw in my sense
of decency too.

128

00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,583
D'oh!

177
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,996
-(laughing)
-(Homer yelling)

178
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,285
Well?

179
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,588
Nope. I don't
feel a thing.

180
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,802
That's creepy,
Bart.

181
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,261
I think you really did
lose your soul.

182
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,222
-Good boy. Ow!
-(growling)

183
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,472
Who's doin' that?

184
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,644
Hmm?

185
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,061
Nothing.

186
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,270
Ow! Help me! Ow!

187
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,480
Why isn't anybody--
Ow! Helping?

188
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,363
-(doorbell rings)
-Hi, is Milhouse home?

189
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,360
He's playing in the dirt
with his Army men.

190
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,742
Oh, and a white
piece of paper, I believe.

191
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,780
(gasps)

192
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,818
Cover me, Sarge.

193
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,157
I'm going after Bart's soul.

194
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,162
(imitating gun fire)

195
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,914
If the Ayatollah can't
have it, no one can.

196
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,868
(imitating engine)

197
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,038
Uh, uh, you know, Milhouse...

198
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,496
(smugly)
Yes?

199
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,546
Bet you're getting tired
of that soul, huh?

200
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,089
No.

201
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,932
Well, suppose someone
wanted to buy it from you?

202
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,339
Ohh. You want
to buy it back, Bart?

203
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,928
Sure. No problem.

204
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,974
-50 bucks.
-What?!

205
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,977
Who's stupid now? Huh?

206
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,019

Bart, what's wrong?

226
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:58,815
There's something
a little off

00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,118
about your hug.

228
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,121

I kind of--

Uh, uh, uh.
Let me guess.

231
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,377
A mother can always tell.

00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,378

00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,629
Hmm.

Mm-hmm.

236
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,134

It almost feels like
you're missing something--

something important.

239

Wait. Wait for me!

(singsongy) Bart, it's time
to end this dream,

258
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,326
and don't forget
the standard scream.

259
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,207
(screaming)

260
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,339
An alligator with sunglasses?

00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,177
Now I've seen everything.

262
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,602
Hiya, folks.
Welcome to Uncle Moe's.

263
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,731
Ah, look at all
the cute little minors.

264
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,769
Wow. That's Moe.
The guy from the ad.

265
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,234
Right this way, Homer.

266
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,234
And he knows my name.

267
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,781
Street signs indoors?

268
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,401
(giggles)
Whatever.

269
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,408
Now Rod, you order
anything you want

270
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,240
for your big ten-o.

271
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,235
Million Dollar Birthday Fries.

272
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,037
Uh-oh.

273
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,000
Moe gets so excited
when you order

274
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,830
his Million Dollar
Birthday Fries

275
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,126
he just has to celebrate.

276
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,130
Here you go.
Here I am, Uncle Moe.

277
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,132
Thank you, ma'am.

278
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,303
This'll be a treat.

279
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,720
Uncle Moe,
here I am, while you eat.

280
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,894
Please take the fries
off my head, kid.

281
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,772
The basket is extremely hot.

282
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,349
How are the southwestern
pizza fingers?

283
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,845
They're, um...

284
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,647
"awesomely outrageous."

285
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,980
Oh, these look good.

286
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,775
Guilt-free
steak fish filets.

287
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,488
No, no, let me level
with you, Marge.

288
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,608
That's just our name

289
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:41,904
for bottom-feeding
suction eel.

290
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,407
You don't want that.

291
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,329
Why don't you try
Moe's Hobo Chicken Chili?

292
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,948
I start with the best part,
the neck,

293
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,456
and then I add
secret hobo spices.

294
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,419
Ooh, <i>tres bien.</i>

295
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,579
Yeah.

296
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,537
(giggles)

297
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,707
What the hell are you doing,
you little freak?!

298
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,006
(crying)

299
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,550
Oh, sorry, kid.
Sorry.

300
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,933
I'm not used to the
laughter of children.

301
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,969
It cuts through me
like a dentist's drill.

302
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,063
But no, no, that was funny,
that was funny

303
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,638
taking away my dignity
like that.

304
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,643
Ha, ha, ha.

305
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,234
I would like
to say grace.

306
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,019
(clears throat)

307
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,233
Lord, have mercy
on my soul

308
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,733
and Mom's soul

309
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,565
and Dad's soul

310
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,070
and Maggie's soul

311
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,991
and that every soul
in Christendom-- Uh!

312
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,201
Bart!

313
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,491
I can't take
this anymore.

314
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,534
I want my soul,
and I want it now.

315
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,827
Bart, you didn't finish
your spaghetti and Moe Balls.

316
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,162
<i>HOMER'S BRAIN:</i>
<i>Silence, you fool.</i>

317
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,287
<i>It can be ours.</i>

318
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,629
Run, boy!

319
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,089
Run.

320
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:42,168
(chewing)
Run for your life... boy.

321
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,263
Milhouse! Milhouse.
You win!

322
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,675
I want this nightmare to end!

323
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,063
(creaking)

324
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,431
(deep breathing)

325
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,104
(sinister voice)
Leave this place.

326
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,727
You are in great danger.

327
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,775
Where's Milhouse?

328
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,569
The one you call
Milhouse is gone.

329
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,657
(normal voice) He went to his
grandma's place

330
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,831
while we're spraying
for potato bugs.

331
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,619
Oh. When Milhouse left

332
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,714
did you notice if he was
carrying a piece of paper?

333
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,039
Oh, yeah. You don't forget
a thing like that.

334
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,004
(alarm sounding)

335
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:21,996
Oh, God.

336
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,384
Here you go!

337
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,546
Here I am, Uncle Moe!
Thank you, ma'am.

00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,845
This will be a treat.
Uncle Moe! Here I am!

339
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,259
-While you eat!
-Yay!

340
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,767
Now do it
for Terri.

341
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,098
What? It's your
birthday too?

342
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,813
BOTH: We're twins.

343
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:36,893

344
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,307
Here you go.
Here I am.

345
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,055
Eat your fries.
Eat them.

346
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,727
Here's you.

347
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:45,065
Ah, geez. And you got
the stink lines and everything.

348
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,574
Oh, dude,
you did not smile.

349
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,988
We eat for free.

350
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,656
Come on, Shoshanna,
let's roll.

351
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,004
(chuckles)

352
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,579
But I sang you
the potato stuffings.

353
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,384
Come on, I sang you
the potato stuffings!

354
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,288
Look at the vein
on that guy's forehead.

355
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,537
He's gonna blow.

356
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,128
(alarm sounding)

357
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,054
Unky Moe?

358
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,552
What... is it,
sweetheart?

359
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,965
My "sodie" is too cold.

360
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,473
My "teef" hurt.

361
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,854
Your "teef" hurt, huh?
Your "teef" hurt?

362
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,062
Well, that's
too freaking bad!

363
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,391
Ya hear me?
I'll tell you

364
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,266
where you can put your
freaking "sodie" too!

365
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,733
(all gasping)

366
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,364
-Ow! My freaking ears!
-(gasps)

367
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,941
Oh, let's go, dear.

368
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,396
I expect that type
of language at Denny's

369
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,356
but not here.

370
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,162
Come on, folks, wait!

371
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,410
Please, come back!

372
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,951
Please, I got a new
offer.

373
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,794
Whenever Uncle Moe threatens you

374
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,749
you get a free
steak... fish.

375
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,750
(sighs)

376
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,165
Okay. Okay.

377
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,712
Milhouse's grandmother
lives on 257th Street

378
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,456
and I'm on Third.

379
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,588
(groans)

380
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,634
(horn blaring)

381
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,638
(pop!)

382
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,643
Well finally, a little luck.

383
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,595
(squeaking)

384
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,484
(evil laugh)

385
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:06,363
(crashing)

386
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,287
(yelling gibberish)

387
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,908
Son, you wait here
while Daddy tries

388
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,955
to talk some sense into
this raving derelict.

389
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,995
(gibberish)

390
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,125
Now slow down,
slow down.

391
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,262
Who's been stealing
your thoughts?

392
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,682
-Hello, Ralph.
-(gasps)

393
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,767
Um, hi, Bart.

394
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,562
I know you from school.

395
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,895
Yes.

396
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,020
A simple proposition, Ralph:

397
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,647
how would you like
to make a dollar?

398
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,494
Uh... I don't know.

399
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,740
All you have to do
is sign a paper

400
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,991
that says I can
have your soul.

401
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,284
I need a soul, Ralph.

402
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,696
Any soul.

403
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,695
Yours.

404
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,616
(whimpers)

405
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:01,964
(crying)

406
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,709
Hey, what's going on
over there?

407
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,961
(hissing)

408
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,962
(pounding on wood)

409
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,047
Go on, take it all.
Get it all out of here.

410
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,132
You know, Moe,
you might want

411
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,087
to keep the fire
extinguishers.

412
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,717
Nah. Too many
bad memories.

413
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,434
Well, look on the
bright side, Moe.

414
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,274
You still got us.

415
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,389
Yeah. You know, that actually
makes me feel a little better.

416
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,897
HOMER: Why?

417
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,518
That was the problem
in the first place.

418
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,895
You were going broke

419
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,571
because we were
your only customers.

420
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,780
Wasn't that the problem
in the first place?

421
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,900
That you were
going broke?

422
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,737
Moe? Moe?

423
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,243
Hey, Moe?

424
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,994
Oh, you're thinking
about all the money

425
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,286
you blew, aren't you?

426
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,749
What was it,
$50,000, $60,000?

427
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,331
Moe? Look,

428
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,915
maybe it would help
if you went over

429
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,590
all the mistakes you made
from the beginning.

430
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,629
-Moe?
-What?!

431
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,631
Let me get a pad.

432
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,090
(snoring)

433
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,585
(knocking on door)

434
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,597
A caller at this hour?

435
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,349
You dial 9-1,

436
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,770
then when I say so,
dial 1 again.

437
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,351
(panting)

438
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,475
Milhouse, please.

439
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,522
Bart, I can't play now.

440
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,185
It's 2:00 A.M.

441
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,234
Milhouse, I got to
have my soul back.

442
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,687
I'll do
anything you want.

443
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,897
Uh... well...

444
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,408
Milhouse,
give him back his soul.

445
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,529
I've got work tomorrow.

446
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,115
I'm really sorry.

447
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,870
I kinda traded
your soul to the guy

448
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,452
at the comic book store.

449
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,787
But look, I got
some cool Pogs.

450
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,503
Alf Pogs.

451
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,963
Remember Alf?

452
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,132
He's back,
in Pog form.

453
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,421
You traded my soul
for Pogs?!

454
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,755
No-o-o-o!

455
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,431
GRANDMOTHER:
Close that door.

456
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,719
You're letting
the heat out.

457
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,642
FATHER:
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

458
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,689
If you're waiting for
the "Hi & Lois" signing

459
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,650
it has been moved
to the Springfield Coliseum.

460
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,401
Please, you have
something of mine

461
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,692
on a little piece of paper.

462
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,645
Oh. So you're Bart Simpson, eh?

463
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,317
Well,
since my breakfast burrito

464
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,655
is congealing rapidly,

465
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,660
I will be blunt.

466
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,661
You're too late.

467
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,332
I sold your soul
last night.

468
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,750
Yes, yes, I found a buyer
right away for that item.

469
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,041
Who?

470
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,834
I'm not at liberty
to divulge the party

471
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,668
but they were most interested
in having possession

472
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,803
of a little boy's soul.

473
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,169
Excuse me.

474
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,427
No banging your head
on the display case, please.

475
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,639
It contains
a very rare "Mary Worth"

476
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,720
in which she has
advised a friend

477
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,564
to commit suicide.
Thank you.

478
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,360
Are you there, God?

479
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,863
It's me, Bart Simpson.

480
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,067
I know I never paid too much
attention in church

481
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:46,037
but I could really use
some of that good stuff now.

482
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,619
I'm afraid.

483
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,714
I'm afraid
some weirdo's got my soul

484
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,420
and I don't know
what they're doing to it.

485
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,921
I just want it back.

486
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,418
Please.

487
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,046
(sobbing)

488
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,052
(whimpers)

489
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,593
I hope you can hear this.

490
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,771
Lisa? You bought this?

491
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,562
With the change
in my piggy bank.

492
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,476
There's no change
in your piggy bank.

493
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,904
Not in any of the ones
you know about.

494
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,783
Oh, Lis, thank you.

495
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,320
Happy to do it.

496
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,364
But you know Bart,
some philosophers

497
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,827
believe that nobody
is born with a soul,

498
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:25,868
that you have to earn one

499
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:26,911
through suffering

500
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,454
and thought
and prayer

501
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,247
like you did
last night.

502
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,500
Uh-huh.

503
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,711

504

Ha! It's like punting on the
Thames. Stroke. Stroke.

505
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,391
Oh!
