00:14:15,911 --> 00:14:17,113
Let's do this.

357
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,351
Hey, grease stains,
seen this bird?

358
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:22,725
Yeah, I remember him.
That's Krista's bird.

359
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,061
He in some kind of trouble?

360
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:25,496
We'll ask the questions.

361
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:28,202
What's the skinny on
this Krista character?

362
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,406
Well, she owns the craft store
down the block.

363
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:31,943
She also sells liquor and weed.

364
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:33,814
- Let's go.
- Don't leave town.

365
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,785
But my niece's wedding
is tomorrow.

366
00:14:35,851 --> 00:14:37,821
I said don't leave town.

367
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:41,930
Fine. Hey, Shirl, it's Vince.
I can't make it.

368
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:45,103
I don't know, some kid
told me I can't leave town.

369
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,675
I've got to get back
to being Alarmy number one.

370
00:14:47,742 --> 00:14:50,714
Gotta warn people about...
something.

371
00:14:50,814 --> 00:14:54,020
[gasps] Death from above.

372
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,158
Falling branches
in Springfield Park!

373
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:59,131
- Stay away.
- [phones chiming]

374
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,769
- We have to get out of here!
- I did it.

375
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:03,272
I'm Alarmy number one!

376
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:06,411
Not for long,
you toad-faced beanbag.

377
00:15:06,512 --> 00:15:10,988
I will cut you into tiny pieces
like my son's pancakes.

378
00:15:11,055 --> 00:15:13,694
I'm going to eat you up
and crap you out

379
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,764
like my son's pancakes.

380
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,134
[grumbles]

381
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:20,508
The air at Springfield Park
is full of pollen.

382
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,379
Individuals with lungs
should avoid the area.

383
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:24,549
[groans]

384
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:27,588
Lifeless bodies at the park.
Possible gas leak.

385
00:15:27,688 --> 00:15:30,426
Demented man throwing objects
at the duck pond.

386
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:32,230
Chemical air attack
at the play yard.

387
00:15:32,297 --> 00:15:34,535
UFOs hovering over picnic area.

388
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:37,941
String-guided dragons, most
likely time travelers attack...

389
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:40,380
I saw the kites first,
ya big galoot!

390
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,482
[rumbling]

391
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,051
[both cry out]

392
00:15:43,085 --> 00:15:44,254
What happened?

393
00:15:44,321 --> 00:15:47,193
The earth couldn't support
your giant ass.

394
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:48,930
Maybe Satan heard your voice

395
00:15:48,997 --> 00:15:51,134
and decided to fast-track you
to hell.

396
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,473
Okay, we both got one in.

397
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,844
How are we getting
out of this sinkhole?

398
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:58,048
I dropped my phone.
Do you have yours?

399
00:15:58,115 --> 00:16:00,988
No. Just start shouting.
Someone will hear us.

400
00:16:01,055 --> 00:16:02,892
- Help!
- Down here!

401
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,929
Save me, not her!

402
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:07,802
[girl]
Hurry, the dragons are coming!

403
00:16:07,902 --> 00:16:11,008
Oh, yeah, Petey.
He was smart as a whip.

404
00:16:11,074 --> 00:16:14,214
Could imitate anything:
political figures of the day,

405
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:17,086
the "You Lose" horn
from Price Is Right.

406
00:16:17,153 --> 00:16:19,391
So many times I thought
contestants lost

407
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,459
when they hadn't.

408
00:16:20,594 --> 00:16:23,967
Why are you talking
about him in the past tense?

409
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:27,474
Oh, I left his cage open
by mistake and he flew away.

410
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:30,313
Last I heard, he joined
a flock of wild parrots.

411
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:33,954
Oh. I guess we came
all this way for nothing.

412
00:16:34,054 --> 00:16:35,356
Stay in town.

413
00:16:35,423 --> 00:16:37,227
But my daughter's wedding is...

414
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:40,734
[sighs]
Shirl? Bad news.

415
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:42,938
We failed Mom again.

416
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:45,376
We are losers.

417
00:16:45,443 --> 00:16:48,951
[voice imitates
The Price is Right horn]

418
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:50,687
Bart, it's Petey!

419
00:16:50,754 --> 00:16:52,825
How can we lure him down here?

420
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:54,494
Uh, uh, I've got it.

421
00:16:54,595 --> 00:16:57,500
[Marge's voice] Bart,
are you secretly recording me?

422
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:59,906
I'm on hold to talk
about our water bill.

423
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:01,943
I'm sorry, no,
I'm not talking to you.

424
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:04,147
I'm talking to my annoying son.

425
00:17:04,214 --> 00:17:05,718
- Yes!
- Got him!

426
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:06,953
[Petey] Annoying son.
[squawks]

427
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,188
[Agnes] Hello?!

428
00:17:08,255 --> 00:17:10,594
Can't any of you
idiots hear us?!

429
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:14,034
There's no one to save us.
We scared everyone away.

430
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,573
- Isn't that ironic?
- I guess.

431
00:17:16,673 --> 00:17:19,044
No, I'm asking.
I don't know what ironic means.

432
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,182
Why did we get so crazy?

433
00:17:21,282 --> 00:17:22,919
I was doing a public service.

434
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:24,756
I warned everyone
that broken sprinkler

435
00:17:24,822 --> 00:17:25,858
would cause a sinkhole.

436
00:17:25,991 --> 00:17:28,997
Bull-scat. You were trying to
move up the leaderboard.

437
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,170
- We both were.
- Now we're stuck down here.

438
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,209
[sighs]
I miss the surface world.

439
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:37,413
Hey, you gotta share that!

440
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,752
We both need strength
to fight off CHUDs.

441
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:43,225
Hell no.
My Werther's, my choice.

442
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:46,064
- [grumbling]
- [choking]

443
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:47,801
Yeah, yeah,
you got candy in there.

444
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:48,904
Stop showing off.

445
00:17:49,004 --> 00:17:51,943
Are you choking?
Hang on, I'll save you.

446
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:54,014
Wait, is this irony?

447
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,788
Ow. Ow! Okay, I'm doing it.

448
00:17:57,888 --> 00:17:58,957
[grunts]

449
00:17:59,023 --> 00:18:00,594
[gasps] I can breathe!

450
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,663
[sighs]

451
00:18:01,763 --> 00:18:02,998
Simpson,

452
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:05,838
instead of mongering fear,
you mongered...

453
00:18:05,904 --> 00:18:07,942
Life itself.

454
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:10,146
- Thank you.
- [gasps]

455
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:12,284
This is the feeling I was after.

456
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,221
Not some stupid leaderboard.

457
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:15,590
I'm gonna help you
get out of here.

458
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,928
Step in my hands,
I'll boost you up.

459
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:19,397
[grunts]

460
00:18:19,464 --> 00:18:23,372
Oh, there's so much
to grab on to.

461
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:28,316
I'll tell everyone
you're down there.

462
00:18:28,382 --> 00:18:32,357
Which will make me
Alarmy number one. Suck it!

463
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,162
Hairless ground hippo stuck
in sinkhole.

464
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:38,235
She's horrible.

465
00:18:38,335 --> 00:18:41,943
Mom, we have one more
birthday surprise for you.

466
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:43,379
Oh. Really?

467
00:18:43,446 --> 00:18:48,021
We tracked down
your best friend.

468
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:50,961
- Petey?
- Petey?

469
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:53,266
How-how is this happening?

470
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,135
How is this happening?!

471
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:57,340
How is this happening?!
How is this happening?!

472
00:18:57,406 --> 00:19:02,818
Aah! Get it off!
Get it off before he... Oh!

473
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:03,986
- Ew.
- Ugh.

474
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:05,924
- Ow! Ow!
- [Lisa] Bart, do something!

475
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:07,862
[grunts]

476
00:19:07,928 --> 00:19:08,864
Sorry.

477
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,132
We thought he loved you.

478
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:12,002
This is how he shows love.

479
00:19:12,103 --> 00:19:14,374
By grooming me
and regurgitating on me.

480
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:16,312
I could never have friends over,

481
00:19:16,378 --> 00:19:17,748
he was so possessive.

482
00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:18,950
Mine!

483
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:21,488
[squawking angrily]

484
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,841
So why did you even get him?

485
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:33,312
I didn't.
I wanted a kitten.

486
00:19:33,412 --> 00:19:35,449
Our neighbor was
giving away their parrot.

487
00:19:35,517 --> 00:19:39,725
Since Petey can meow, my dad
decided he was close enough.

488
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:41,028
[Petey] Meow.

489
00:19:41,128 --> 00:19:43,432
- You're nothing like a kitten!
- [all yell]

490
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:46,405
Don't worry, we'll
take him back to Townsburg.

491
00:19:46,472 --> 00:19:48,175
He's part of a wild flock there.

492
00:19:48,242 --> 00:19:50,580
You went all the way
to Townsburg?

493
00:19:50,714 --> 00:19:53,051
We wanted to get
you something, you know,

494
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,988
personal for your birthday.

495
00:19:55,088 --> 00:19:58,696
Yeah. We did not make friends
on the bus ride home.

496
00:19:58,796 --> 00:20:00,199
Petey is kind of racist.

497
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,239
Well, that's just...
[crying]

498
00:20:03,305 --> 00:20:04,440
We're sorry.

499
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:06,478
We didn't mean to
re-traumatize you

500
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,917
with your childhood
nightmare bird.

501
00:20:09,017 --> 00:20:11,321
My wonderful babies!

502
00:20:11,422 --> 00:20:13,760
You went to all that trouble
for me.

503
00:20:13,827 --> 00:20:17,500
I wasn't an afterthought,
I was a thought.

504
00:20:17,568 --> 00:20:21,074
Well, yeah, 'cause... you know,

505
00:20:21,174 --> 00:20:24,481
we see you as a person.

506
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:28,790
We really do.
Our favorite person.

507
00:20:28,924 --> 00:20:31,061
Oh, that is so...

508
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:33,199
- [crunch]
- Ow!

509
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,970
You little...

510
00:20:36,037 --> 00:20:39,812
Who wants to help Mommy
abandon Petey in Townsburg?

511
00:20:39,912 --> 00:20:40,981
[both] We do!

what that noise was.

I think it came from over there.

Look at the fullness
in that sleeve.

What was that sound?
I don't see anything.

Well, it's a mystery.
We may never know.
