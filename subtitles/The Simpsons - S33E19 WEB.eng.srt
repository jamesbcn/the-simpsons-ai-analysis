1
00:00:19,205 --> 00:00:21,209
I come bearing
an important communiqué.

2
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:23,814
It's from the marching band
director at Springfield High.

3
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:26,987
Oh, did he get his swollen head
stuck in a French horn?

4
00:00:27,054 --> 00:00:29,058
Uh, there's no mention of that.

5
00:00:29,158 --> 00:00:31,630
But it seems one of the band's
most important musicians

6
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,970
injured his middle toe doing
a high step in double-time.

7
00:00:35,037 --> 00:00:38,109
That's footwork suicide!

8
00:00:38,176 --> 00:00:39,780
They need
a replacement sax player,

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,117
and they've requested...
Lisa Simpson.

10
00:00:42,218 --> 00:00:44,656
Me, in the high school band?

11
00:00:44,723 --> 00:00:47,461
Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!

12
00:00:47,562 --> 00:00:50,400
One yes would suffice.
Pack your sax, Lisa,

13
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,371
you're moving up to high school.

14
00:00:52,404 --> 00:00:53,808
Three days a week after school,

15
00:00:53,874 --> 00:00:55,645
otherwise you're still
in second grade.

16
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,153
I finally get
to play with people

17
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,093
who respect music theory
and tradition.

18
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,830
Teenagers!

19
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,370
Class, we have
a new baritone sax player.

20
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:10,107
Direct from
Springfield Elementary.

21
00:01:10,207 --> 00:01:11,877
Largo's losers.

22
00:01:11,977 --> 00:01:13,714
Hi. Hello.

23
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:15,117
Now, if you'll turn to page 12

24
00:01:15,217 --> 00:01:17,087
in your marching band songbook.

25
00:01:17,154 --> 00:01:19,826
The theme to Hawaii Five-O?!
Wow!

26
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:22,364
Yeah, Mr. Orlando is cool.

27
00:01:22,431 --> 00:01:25,738
We do 50-year-old songs
instead of 100-year-old songs.

28
00:01:33,153 --> 00:01:36,392
Shauna Chalmers,
thank you for joining us.

29
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:38,396
I'm gonna call you James Corden,

30
00:01:38,496 --> 00:01:40,501
because you're
a late, late show.

31
00:01:42,338 --> 00:01:44,475
He totally relates to us
on our level.

32
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:47,549
- Burnout.
- Waste case.

33
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:48,985
Third-chair slacker.

34
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:50,922
Shut up, woodwinds.

35
00:01:51,022 --> 00:01:52,324
Okay, from the top.

36
00:01:58,638 --> 00:01:59,706
Okay, cut.

37
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:02,111
Apparently Supertramp
isn't giving us the rights

38
00:02:02,177 --> 00:02:04,015
to "Goodbye Stranger."

39
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,524
No...

40
00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:12,632
Shauna! I didn't know
you played drums.

41
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:16,306
And I didn't know some tiny band
dork was gonna talk to me.

42
00:02:16,372 --> 00:02:18,544
It's me, Lisa Simpson?

43
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:20,080
You babysat for us.

44
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,750
Last Saturday night.

45
00:02:21,884 --> 00:02:23,219
TikTok is dumb.

46
00:02:23,286 --> 00:02:26,059
Well, anyway,
your drumming's really good.

47
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,461
Wow.

48
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:30,334
Dear diary,
today I got a compliment

49
00:02:30,434 --> 00:02:33,974
from a rando about something
I don't care about.

50
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,112
I have a diary, too!

51
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:44,095
People were playing eighth notes
like it was nothing.

52
00:02:44,195 --> 00:02:46,633
Band kids are the coolest kids
in high school.

53
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:49,606
No fair.
Lisa gets to go to high school?

54
00:02:49,706 --> 00:02:51,342
I was supposed
to be King of the Burnouts

55
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:52,779
before she even got there.

56
00:02:52,846 --> 00:02:55,317
Well, son, I guess Lisa's
just unusually bright.

57
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:58,791
She gets it from me.

58
00:02:58,858 --> 00:03:00,260
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

59
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:02,297
I left all my sheet music
at school.

60
00:03:02,364 --> 00:03:04,669
I have to go get it.

61
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,868
- Shauna!
- I'm Shauna!

62
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:23,006
Did you stay late to practice?

63
00:03:23,073 --> 00:03:24,943
No way. As if.

64
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,281
You're practicing. Being stupid.

65
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:29,920
You don't need to.
You're great at it.

66
00:03:29,986 --> 00:03:31,957
I'm jealous.

67
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:35,932
Shauna, we share
a passion for music.

68
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:38,169
Do you want to jam?

69
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:40,340
Yeah, jam this stick in my eye

70
00:03:40,373 --> 00:03:42,679
if this conversation
goes on another second.

71
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:46,085
Fine! But I'm not afraid
to admit that music

72
00:03:46,152 --> 00:03:48,591
means something to me,
unlike you.

73
00:03:48,691 --> 00:03:51,530
You're Shauna.

74
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:54,903
Hey!

75
00:03:54,936 --> 00:03:56,907
I'm sorry if
I was mean back there...

76
00:03:57,007 --> 00:03:58,376
little weirdo.

77
00:03:58,476 --> 00:04:00,013
I really don't know
how to take that.

78
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,519
Well, maybe we can talk about it
tomorrow at my house...

79
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:04,890
when you come over to jam.

80
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:06,159
I'd love to!

81
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:07,762
Where do you live?

82
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:09,165
Okay, stalker.

83
00:04:14,743 --> 00:04:16,513
Oh, hello, Lisa Simpson.

84
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,483
And how are you
this fine evening?

85
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:22,191
Dad, stop interrogating people,
you fascist!

86
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:27,434
Wow, you're really rude
to your dad.

87
00:04:27,502 --> 00:04:30,240
Thanks. That's actually
the reason I got into drums.

88
00:04:30,307 --> 00:04:32,579
To drive him crazy.

89
00:04:32,645 --> 00:04:33,781
But then I...

90
00:04:33,848 --> 00:04:36,018
Turns out,
I really like playing music.

91
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:38,089
It takes the suck out of things.

92
00:04:38,156 --> 00:04:40,293
It does take
the suck out of things.

93
00:04:40,393 --> 00:04:42,832
I just said a light swear.

94
00:04:45,303 --> 00:04:47,341
Well, sounds like you
girls are having fun.

95
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:48,844
How would you know?!

96
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:50,548
Yes. Well, uh,

97
00:04:50,615 --> 00:04:52,519
dinner's almost ready, dear.

98
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:54,656
Lisa and I are eating
at the mall.

99
00:04:54,723 --> 00:04:57,394
I've been hand-rolling
gnocchi all day.

100
00:04:57,494 --> 00:04:59,365
Stop touching my food.

101
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:01,402
Food-toucher.

102
00:05:03,106 --> 00:05:05,511
Look at all this science stuff.

103
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:07,181
Are you building a Frankenstein?

104
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:08,818
'Cause if you are,
you have to tell me.

105
00:05:08,884 --> 00:05:11,523
Ah, yes.
Uh, you're here to pick up Lisa.

106
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,863
She's at the mall with my,
uh, challenging daughter.

107
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,403
Eh, tell me something, Simpson,
do you like beer?

108
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:20,975
Hmm, I never thought about it.

109
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:27,054
Well, I've been brewing
my own Belgian ale

110
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,225
in the style
of the Trappist monks.

111
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,195
It's a,
it's a stupid hobby really.

112
00:05:31,262 --> 00:05:32,966
That is stupid.

113
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,468
I buy my beer in a bar.

114
00:05:34,536 --> 00:05:36,138
I-I'm sure you do.

115
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:38,042
But, uh, just take a sip.

116
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,363
This is the most delicious drink

117
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:51,269
I ever drank
that could get me drunk.

118
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:52,572
You made this?

119
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,509
Yes, I did. If you'd like,

120
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:58,016
I could show you how to brew it
using these simple ingredients.

121
00:05:58,082 --> 00:06:00,888
Beer has ingredients?

122
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:02,559
What the hell?

123
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,934
You have so much to teach me.

124
00:06:10,508 --> 00:06:12,912
Okay, worked there,
got fired there.

125
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:15,751
Got unfairly accused
of shoplifting there.

126
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:18,991
Oh, shoplifted
a ton of stuff there.

127
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:21,095
Wow, you've really lived.

128
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:22,899
In this end of the mall, sure.

129
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,435
Cool!

130
00:06:24,502 --> 00:06:26,072
A selfie machine.

131
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,619
Ooh, A Prom Before Dying.

132
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:35,056
I read that book.
It's about two teenagers

133
00:06:35,123 --> 00:06:39,131
who fall in love despite
only having 45 minutes to live.

134
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,701
Sounds stupid.

135
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:43,406
Let's go see it. It's on me.

136
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,312
Shauna's so great.
She's like a fun, older friend

137
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:48,784
who's mean to me for no reason.

138
00:06:48,817 --> 00:06:51,289
But somehow I really want
to hang out with her.

139
00:06:51,422 --> 00:06:54,028
What do you call that?

140
00:06:54,128 --> 00:06:56,232
Um, she seems young for a movie

141
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,403
with adult themes.

142
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:00,240
You have to let her in.

143
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,843
I'm her big sister.

144
00:07:01,977 --> 00:07:04,849
That's it... big sister!

145
00:07:04,983 --> 00:07:08,389
Now let's go watch teenage
sickos make out, then croak...

146
00:07:08,456 --> 00:07:10,962
little sis.

147
00:07:48,704 --> 00:07:51,175
You've made a very fussy enemy.

148
00:07:51,242 --> 00:07:53,046
Well... later, losers!

149
00:07:53,146 --> 00:07:56,252
That's what Shauna and I
call people who aren't us.

150
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,489
Isn't that cute?

151
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:02,699
Hmm, I'm not sure
Shauna's the best influence.

152
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:05,370
She always seems
like she's so over it.

153
00:08:05,437 --> 00:08:07,775
Even when "it" is
something nice.

154
00:08:07,842 --> 00:08:10,748
Yep, teens are garbage.

155
00:08:10,815 --> 00:08:12,652
Anyway, I'm off to 'Mers.

156
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:14,421
Don't you mean Moe's?

157
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:16,125
No, Chalmers.

158
00:08:16,225 --> 00:08:19,566
Now there's a different
sad, old man getting me drunk.

159
00:08:39,138 --> 00:08:40,440
Oh, man.

160
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,779
Art thou as hammered as I?

161
00:08:42,845 --> 00:08:45,785
Yes, verily, but, Homer,
Trappist brewing

162
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:48,757
is about more
than just drinking the beer.

163
00:08:48,857 --> 00:08:51,563
It's about the traditions
of the Belgian monks

164
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,468
who created this divine quaff.

165
00:09:03,954 --> 00:09:06,258
See, that's what I like
about home brewing.

166
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:09,566
You're there when it enters
the world, so full of promise.

167
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,538
And you know that if you pour
your heart and hard work

168
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:15,343
into it,
it won't tell you it's pregnant

169
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,080
just to mess with you.

170
00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:20,453
Simpson!

171
00:09:20,554 --> 00:09:22,491
I think it's time for you

172
00:09:22,592 --> 00:09:25,296
to brew this next batch
on your own.

173
00:09:25,363 --> 00:09:26,967
You think I'm ready?

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,875
Oh, I sense
great drunkenness in you.

175
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:36,252
Mm. I didn't think
he'd transform on page one,

176
00:09:36,318 --> 00:09:38,724
but I'm not complaining.

177
00:09:41,195 --> 00:09:43,199
My horror-romance!

178
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,352
Messing with parents
is the best.

179
00:09:57,762 --> 00:10:00,099
Wow, Shauna, you're so good!

180
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,607
I've been thinking, you should
try out for lead drummer.

181
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,443
They would never give that
to me.

182
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:08,349
Even if I wanted it,
which I don't.

183
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:10,386
Why won't you shut up
about this?

184
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:12,658
Mmm, these Cheetos are cheesy.

185
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:14,829
Shauna, listen,
the last thing I'd ever do

186
00:10:14,896 --> 00:10:18,269
is imply that you care,
but I think you're a star.

187
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:20,774
And stars are meant to shine.

188
00:10:20,808 --> 00:10:22,745
So if you won't do this
for yourself,

189
00:10:22,812 --> 00:10:24,549
will you do it for me?

190
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,191
I think I have
cheese dust in my eyes.

191
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,095
Fine, I'll do the audition.

192
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:33,065
But only to shut you up.

193
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,034
Yes!

194
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:36,472
Mind if I celebrate
with a sax solo?

195
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:38,644
Oh, that'd be great.

196
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,282
Sarcasm noted.

197
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:52,304
Huzzah, big brother!

198
00:10:52,404 --> 00:10:54,041
Thank you, petit frère.

199
00:10:55,945 --> 00:10:59,151
Next audition...
Shauna Chalmers?!

200
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:00,554
I am so out of here.

201
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:42,337
Shauna!

202
00:11:44,408 --> 00:11:46,412
Shauna, that was great!

203
00:11:46,478 --> 00:11:49,519
I won't tell anyone
how hard you practiced.

204
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:50,788
Like I care.

205
00:11:50,854 --> 00:11:52,057
Thanks.

206
00:11:52,157 --> 00:11:55,163
Um, Shauna, I'm sorry
to bother you,

207
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,400
but I'm Trevor McBride,
star quarterback.

208
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,505
Cool bio, Jock Cousteau.

209
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:00,774
What do you want?

210
00:12:00,908 --> 00:12:02,712
Well, um,
I couldn't help but noticing

211
00:12:02,778 --> 00:12:05,316
that you blew my mind tonight
with your drumming.

212
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,655
I'm having a pool party
at my house tomorrow.

213
00:12:07,788 --> 00:12:09,324
- Do you want to come?
- Mm.

214
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:11,630
Of course, your band friends
are invited, too.

215
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:13,834
Sure. I guess.

216
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,971
"Sure" and "I guess"?

217
00:12:16,071 --> 00:12:17,340
Crushing it!

218
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:18,744
I don't know. I've never been

219
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,648
to a teen party before.

220
00:12:20,748 --> 00:12:22,785
Don't worry, you'll be
with your big sis.

221
00:12:22,852 --> 00:12:25,490
Whatevs, it's all good, NBD.

222
00:12:25,557 --> 00:12:28,530
What am I saying?
It's a huge BD!

223
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,701
Oh, I forgot to mention.

224
00:12:30,768 --> 00:12:32,905
Everyone has to bring
a beer to get in.

225
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:36,178
Huh, I think I have
a hookup for some brews.

226
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:38,784
Hmm. Warm caramel color,

227
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,754
the foam is
immaculately bubbled.

228
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:43,292
Beautifully brewed,
Brother Homer.

229
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:46,465
Today, you have truly become

230
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:49,004
my padre from another madre.

231
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,381
I wish only to be worthy
of our humble labels.

232
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,688
Daddy?

233
00:12:57,755 --> 00:12:59,559
I know I've been kind of
a B-word lately.

234
00:12:59,626 --> 00:13:02,598
That stands for Brenda.
She's this total bitch I know.

235
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,869
So Lisa and I want
to apologize by, like,

236
00:13:04,936 --> 00:13:06,773
putting on a little show
for you.

237
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,478
Shauna, that is
so thoughtful and-and...

238
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:11,081
Just shut up
and come in the house!

239
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:13,620
You're so embarrassing!
Both of you!

240
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,891
Sorry, Shauna.

241
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:27,515
Awesome! This beer is exactly

242
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:29,318
where the chick
said it would be.

243
00:13:29,384 --> 00:13:30,721
Her name is Shauna!

244
00:13:30,854 --> 00:13:32,466
Learn three things
about her that don't have

245
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,996
to do with her looks,
or you're off the team!

246
00:13:40,306 --> 00:13:43,613
Wonderful. Shauna and I
are finally connecting.

247
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,651
We're just like
the Gilmore Girls.

248
00:13:45,751 --> 00:13:47,955
And I'm Lorelai.

249
00:13:48,022 --> 00:13:51,095
I'm so happy for you.

250
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,714
What?

251
00:14:00,781 --> 00:14:02,852
- Bravissima! Yes!
- Yeah!

252
00:14:02,918 --> 00:14:05,156
- Wonderful, wonderful!
- Yeah! All right!

253
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:14,041
Welcome to the pool party, ladies.

254
00:14:14,107 --> 00:14:15,577
We've got pizza, burgers...

255
00:14:15,644 --> 00:14:17,247
Possible and Impossible...

256
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:19,852
And hella soda,
courtesy of my parents.

257
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,823
Love you, T-Man!

258
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,031
Oh, my God!

259
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,902
It's a little girl
with a saxophone.

260
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:29,505
So cute.

261
00:14:29,572 --> 00:14:31,509
Play us a song, Saxophone Girl.

262
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:33,245
Okay, sure.

263
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,886
I don't care what people say.

264
00:14:36,986 --> 00:14:39,892
I just think music is one
of the coolest sounds out there.

265
00:14:39,992 --> 00:14:41,596
Want to kiss about it?

266
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:43,466
Duh.

267
00:14:44,836 --> 00:14:46,338
Trev,

268
00:14:46,371 --> 00:14:48,577
Mom and I are going to one
of those fun escape rooms

269
00:14:48,643 --> 00:14:49,912
in another city.

270
00:14:49,979 --> 00:14:51,482
Is it okay with you
that we won't

271
00:14:51,549 --> 00:14:52,952
be back for seven hours?

272
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:55,089
Oh, don't worry
about them, Brian.

273
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:56,458
It's almost nightfall.

274
00:14:56,526 --> 00:14:59,197
That's when teen pizza parties
generally break up.

275
00:14:59,297 --> 00:15:00,734
Bye.

276
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,707
Well, party's over.

277
00:15:03,807 --> 00:15:06,412
Now let's make
two separate recycling piles.

278
00:15:06,513 --> 00:15:08,282
The beer...

279
00:15:08,382 --> 00:15:09,952
is here!

280
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,481
Uh, this is like
one of those TV shows

281
00:15:24,582 --> 00:15:26,619
I'm not supposed to watch.

282
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:31,996
Our beer, someone stole it!

283
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:34,902
But I brewed that
with the malt of my loins.

284
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,643
Oh, God,
please don't let Shauna have

285
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,979
anything to do with this.

286
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:41,616
I'm gonna check
her social media.

287
00:15:41,716 --> 00:15:43,452
She lets you follow her?

288
00:15:43,553 --> 00:15:44,589
Of course not.

289
00:15:44,722 --> 00:15:46,458
I follow her as "Rodrigo,"

290
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:49,164
a goth teen from Argentina.

291
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:52,571
Oh, dear God,
that so-called pool party

292
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:55,176
is a bona fide rager!

293
00:15:56,411 --> 00:15:59,886
Our homebrewed beer is
inebriating these minors.

294
00:15:59,986 --> 00:16:01,523
We have to go save them.

295
00:16:01,556 --> 00:16:04,161
The beers I mean,
from those awful teens!

296
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:07,400
Excuse me, have you seen Shauna?

297
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,004
Big sister?

298
00:16:09,104 --> 00:16:11,375
Cool, it's a metal beer bong.

299
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:13,647
Thanks.

300
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:21,028
Hello, emergency?

301
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:23,499
I'd like to report
the abandonment of a minor.

302
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,403
The minor is me!

303
00:16:25,504 --> 00:16:28,375
Hurry, this party is
out of control!

304
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:29,645
What are you doing?

305
00:16:29,712 --> 00:16:32,818
Did you just narc out the party,
you party narc?

306
00:16:32,918 --> 00:16:34,120
Where were you?!

307
00:16:34,187 --> 00:16:36,291
I was with Trevor, getting some.

308
00:16:36,358 --> 00:16:38,797
- Some what?
- Some smooches.

309
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,601
- Duh!
- Your turn.

310
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,505
You give me that!

311
00:16:42,571 --> 00:16:44,441
Oh, no, this is terrible.

312
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:47,080
Homer, we need to get
every one of those bottles,

313
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,585
or my superintending days
are over.

314
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:56,833
You abandoned me.

315
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,469
And I was really scared.

316
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:02,010
I thought big sisters were
supposed to take care of you.

317
00:17:02,076 --> 00:17:04,214
And I thought little sisters
weren't supposed

318
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,653
to be stupid, snitchy babies.

319
00:17:06,753 --> 00:17:09,391
I am not a stupid, snitchy baby!

320
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,936
It's worse than we thought, Chief.

321
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:16,606
This party's not just epic.

322
00:17:16,673 --> 00:17:18,175
It's legendary.

323
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:21,481
Now, who could have given
these teens so much beer?

324
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:23,753
Uh, good evening,
Your Eminences.

325
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,156
May God be with you.

326
00:17:25,223 --> 00:17:27,160
Chief, those are no monks!

327
00:17:29,865 --> 00:17:31,703
You two are under arrest

328
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:33,405
for subjecting these kids

329
00:17:33,472 --> 00:17:35,844
to the best night
of their lives.

330
00:17:35,978 --> 00:17:38,082
Well, there goes my career
and my pension.

331
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:40,754
Oh, and also
I'm going to prison.

332
00:17:44,294 --> 00:17:46,298
Chief?

333
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,269
I just breathalyzed
all these teens.

334
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:50,607
They're all blowing 0.0.

335
00:17:50,707 --> 00:17:52,945
Dear God, they're already dead!

336
00:17:52,978 --> 00:17:55,784
This beer contains no alcohol.

337
00:17:57,153 --> 00:17:59,124
Simpson, you-you glorious idiot.

338
00:17:59,224 --> 00:18:00,961
You forgot to add the yeast.

339
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:02,196
What forgot the who?

340
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:04,802
No fermentation means
no intoxication.

341
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:06,873
Mwah!
Your incompetence

342
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:08,977
just saved our cowls.

343
00:18:09,077 --> 00:18:11,649
Attention teens,
you are not drunk.

344
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,352
Repeat... not drunk.

345
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:16,024
Please examine
your outrageous behavior

346
00:18:16,091 --> 00:18:18,730
through a lens
of newfound self-awareness.

347
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,468
Please use this experience

348
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:24,207
to better understand
the pressures you're all under,

349
00:18:24,274 --> 00:18:27,046
and have more compassion
for your friends,

350
00:18:27,146 --> 00:18:29,752
teachers, parents,
and most of all,

351
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:32,056
yourselves. Over.

352
00:18:32,123 --> 00:18:34,895
You bungling brewmasters
are free to go.

353
00:18:34,962 --> 00:18:36,298
My career.

354
00:18:36,431 --> 00:18:38,770
It's saved.

355
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,006
Yes.

356
00:18:40,106 --> 00:18:43,379
Whoa, Rodrigo
from Instagram is crying

357
00:18:43,513 --> 00:18:45,282
at our party!

358
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:47,588
Let's comfort him.

359
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:50,894
All right, yeah...

360
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:53,365
Yes, all right.

361
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,506
Sweetie, what are you doing
at a teenager party?

362
00:18:56,572 --> 00:18:58,042
Shauna brought me!

363
00:18:58,108 --> 00:19:00,714
But I never want
to see her stupid face again!

364
00:19:02,216 --> 00:19:03,687
- Dad...
- Mm.

365
00:19:03,753 --> 00:19:05,289
Oh, Lisa.

366
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:07,193
It's been a week now.

367
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:09,230
Are you still upset
about Shauna?

368
00:19:09,297 --> 00:19:12,070
I really did think of her
like a sister.

369
00:19:12,103 --> 00:19:15,142
Well, you still have
your real sister.

370
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:23,058
Well, your father and I
are headed out.

371
00:19:23,158 --> 00:19:25,129
We're gonna spend
some Mommy-Daddy time.

372
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:27,367
Marge, did you get
the hotel room?

373
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,707
Because I got the chants
and the incense.

374
00:19:30,774 --> 00:19:32,711
Ave Maria.

375
00:19:34,147 --> 00:19:36,084
That must be the babysitter.

376
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:40,359
Oh, hello.

377
00:19:40,393 --> 00:19:42,330
You look... well.

378
00:19:42,397 --> 00:19:44,167
Thanks.
I thought I might see you here

379
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:46,806
at the house you live in.

380
00:19:48,275 --> 00:19:49,745
What's going on here?

381
00:19:49,812 --> 00:19:52,083
Well, whatever it is,
the awkwardness is...

382
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,653
...delicious.

383
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:58,262
So, how's the marching band?

384
00:19:58,362 --> 00:20:00,199
I can't believe
they made me quit

385
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,903
when that kid's toe healed.

386
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:03,840
I hate Western medicine.

387
00:20:03,907 --> 00:20:05,376
Oh, I quit, too.

388
00:20:05,443 --> 00:20:08,282
I started a punk band, where I'm
the drummer and the singer.

389
00:20:08,382 --> 00:20:10,219
Just like Phil Collins!

390
00:20:10,286 --> 00:20:11,689
Okay, got to go.

391
00:20:11,756 --> 00:20:14,060
We're called
Brenda and the B-words.

392
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,897
I never would have done it
without all that

393
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,968
stupid confidence you gave me.

394
00:20:18,102 --> 00:20:20,406
Wow, that's actually
really nice to hear.

395
00:20:20,473 --> 00:20:22,511
Shut up, it wasn't meant to be.

396
00:20:22,611 --> 00:20:24,280
Anyway, I brought my drums.

397
00:20:24,314 --> 00:20:25,784
You want to jam?

398
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,153
I'd like that.

399
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,124
Oh, dear God, no.
