00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,954
Get your own yogurt.

{\an8}Ooh. Oh my God!

{\an8}I’ll give you any
yogurt in the store,

{\an8}And Lisa,

{\an8}there’s a letter in my locker

{\an8}a take-a-penny tray

88
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,797
{\an8}So why steal the yogurt?

89
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,839
{\an8}We have to find out
what they’re up to.

90
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:17,923
{\an8}Hmm... Milhouse,

91
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:18,927
{\an8}change of plan--

92
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,178

This is our life
now, Milhouse.

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,610
{\an8}you know we have
only one agent

119
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,655
{\an8}who stands a chance
with those bullies.

120
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,279
(sighs)
My brother.

121
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,956
Lord, give me guidance.

122
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,039
{\an8}That’s right, the Guidance
Department-- Detention Room.

123
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,084
{\an8}Thank you, Mrs. Lord.

124
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,632

125
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,723
{\an8}Hmm?

(grunting)

127
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,981
{\an8}All out?

128
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,019
{\an8}I can’t make my famous raisin
sponge-cake without raisins.

129
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,863
Kids love the zing of raisins!

130
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,238
If I help you,
I want full immunity

131
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,284
for all pranks past

132
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,538
and you have to teach me
a swear word

133
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,000
I don’t already know.

134
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,870
No deal.

135
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,456
Okay, suit yourself.

136
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,041
{\an8}It’s not like you have any
major events coming up

137
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,497
{\an8}that the bullies would want
to disrupt.

138
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,757

{\an8}Principal Skinner,
as we both know,

141
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,219
{\an8}but you might need
reminding,

142
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:30,102
{\an8}the annual bake sale provides
90% of the school’s funding.

143
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,681
Okay, you
have a deal,

144
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,097
you conniving
little...

-(whispering)
-(gasps)

146
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,055
Wow, that’s a swear?

147
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,397
Used as a noun it is.

148
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,692
Sweet!

149
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:41,935
Now I’m going to need
some wheels.

150
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,316
{\an8}Yes, of course.

151
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,153
{\an8}I think we can wrangle you
a used bicycle.

152
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,238
{\an8}Do you prefer Schwinn or Huffy?

153
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,032
{\an8}Bart? Where did he...?

154
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,576
(gasps)
My car keys!

155
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,579

Road kill, burnt hair,

158
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,747
my sister’s retainer case,

159
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,542
six weeks of bottled farts,
possum placenta,

160
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,746
sweat from a walk-around
Goofy suit.

161
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,627
And finally, T.C.B.Y.--

162
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:07,014
that container
of botulized yogurt.

163
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,143
Okay, everyone, masks on.

(door squeaks open)

170
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,370
{\an8}Jimbo, sweetie, I have
to run to the bank.

171
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,029
{\an8}Are you boys going
to be okay alone?

172
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,537
{\an8}Put a top on, Mom!

173
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,828
{\an8}Everyone’s seen
your implants.

174
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:35,962
But the doctor said
the air will help them...

175
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,168
Just go!

176
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,458

177
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,381
Lookin’ good,
Carol!

178
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,711
(squeaking)

179
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,705
(hissing)

180
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,089
(sniffing, liquid hissing)

181
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,048
(squeals)

182
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,388
(beeping)

183
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,436
(both grunting)

184
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,230
I saw it first!

185
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,438
You are such
a liar!

186
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,567
(grunting
continues)

187
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,283
(train whistle blowing)

188
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,373
You give
that to me!

189
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,001
(methodic beeping)

190
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,998
(train whistling blowing,
train chugging)

191
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,625
(crashing)

192
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,972
(train whistle blowing)

193
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,604
(liquid hissing)

194
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,680
(sniffing)

195
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,426
Must... escape.

196
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,688
(wheel squeaking)

197
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,404
(whimpers)

198
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,822
Springfield
Elementary is about

199
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,490
to be Stinkfield
Elementary.

200
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,616
Lisa, they’re going to put
a stink bomb in the school.

201
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,161
I might be able
to stop them,

202
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,575
but I’ll need a schematic
of Jimbo’s house.

203
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:03,004
Jimbo drew a couple of pictures
of his house in second grade,

204
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,593
{\an8}but I can’t vouch
for their accuracy.

205
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,049
{\an8}The teacher gave him
a frowny-face.

206
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:09,468
(button tones beeping)

207
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,433
I’m so proud
of us.

208
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,721
<i>(Odd Couple </i>theme
ring tone playing)

209
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,515
You got Jimbo.

210
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,678
They’re on to
you, Jimbo!

211
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:19,766
Get out of there!

212
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,480
Scram... mbled eggs
would be lovely

213
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,311
for breakfast,
Mother.

214
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,856
(whispering):
Just go! Quickly!

215
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,069
We’re busted!

216
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,568
Thanks, mole.

217
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,240
Now make your split-
screen vanish.

218
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,068
Will do!

219
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,702
Ooh!

220
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,868
Damn it, these blueprints
are all wrong.

221
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:43,294
Where’s the roller coaster room
and the shark tank?

222
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,504
-(heavy door closes)
-Huh?

223
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:45,882
Ooh.

224
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,547
(grunts)

225
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,521
Son of a beach ball,
they’re gone!

226
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,731
(whimpering)

227
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,231
(phone speed dialing)

228
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,063
I’ve got a man down!

229
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,318
Well, not a man.

230
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,819
A very special boy.

231
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,190
(static on other end)

232
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,647
Chloe, I need those
schematics now!

233
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,107
What? Who is this?

234
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,366
I’m Jack Bauer.
Who the hell are you?

235
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,659
-Me? Uh, I’m...
Ahmed Adoody.
-(rapid gunfire)

236
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:23,044
Chloe, find out all you
can about Ahmed Adoody.

237
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,582
Does anyone there know
Ahmed Adoody?

238
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,575
Ahmed Adoody, wealthy
Saudi financier.

239
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,747
Disappeared into Afghanistan
in the late 90s.

240
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,296
-Really?
-No, Jack, it’s
a joke name.

241
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,799
You’re being
set up.

242
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,011
Damn it!

243
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:37,221
(laughing)

244
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,767
Now, let’s see.

245
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,058
20 minutes at 300 degrees
is the equivalent

246
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,482
of five minutes at...

247
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,900
Let’s see...
(mumbles)

248
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,098
1,200 degrees.

249
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,108
Now...

250
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,321
to make the folded index card
that goes in front of the cake.

251
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,241
(loud hissing)

252
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,912
(sniffing)

253
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,990
(explosion)

254
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,906
(hissing)

255
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,504
(groans)

256
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,923
D’oh!

257
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,039
(clock ticks)

258
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,705
No!

259
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,714
Oh. Pink frosting
fixes everything.

260
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,390
HOMER:
Say, is your butt numb
from all this vibrating?

261
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,311
(laughs)
Oh, mine is.

262
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,560
Still, I wouldn’t describe
it as unpleasant.

263
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,642
Well, let’s get
some shut-eye.

264
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,308
Ooh, it’s that
bar I like!

265
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,608
Wait here in the car.

266
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,941
Ow!

267
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,740
Okay, this might
hurt a little.

268
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,072
No problem.

269
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,696
(whirring)

270
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,334
Oh, sweet mother
of Mary!

271
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,251
(whirring)

272
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,249
(groans)

273
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,832
Okay, Milhouse,
what do you want to do?

274
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,497
Well, the school’s having
a bake sale.

275
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,915
Old Betsy’ll get us there.

276
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:56,343
(grunting)

277
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,848
We are projecting an
effective stink radius

278
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,349
farther than any of us
can kick a kickball.

279
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,352
Sir, we have to call off
this bake sale now!

280
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,515
Yes, yes, yes,
we have to do something.

281
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:14,483
Although, the basketball hoops
have been retracted.

282
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,737
D.J. Fun-times has already
cashed his deposit,

283
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,109
and Superintendent Chalmers
won’t be happy to hear...

284
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,366
I won’t be happy to
hear what, Seymour?

285
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,159
Um, that, uh, bake sale
revenue projections

286
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,742
are through the roof!

287
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,747
I’m very happy to hear that.

288
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,709
You don’t know me at all.

289
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,960
We have to find those
bullies before the
bake sale starts.

290
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,843
Martin, run a top-down search
on the school security grid.

291
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,671
Will do, and you chose
the perfect person.

292
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,928
(laughs)

293
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:45,969
(mechanical hum)

294
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,177
(gasps)
The stink bomb!

295
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,187
I can’t let anyone see it!

296
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,649
Martin, anything?

297
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,729
I wish.

298
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,943
This is as boring
as mainstream cinema.

299
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,654
(both laughing)

300
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,744
So true.

301
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,779
(methodic beeping)

302
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,512
Cops. Act natural.

303
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,049
(girly laughter)

304
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,643
(high-pitched voice):
Hello, Officer!

305
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,298
Oh, afternoon,
ma’am.

306
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,596
(sighs)
What is it about a woman
in a Dumpster?

307
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,233
(methodic beeping)

308
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,412
Wait!

309
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,830
(grunts)

310
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,278
Mr. Simpson!

311
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,198
(groans)

312
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,832
(gasping)

313
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,837
My cake!

314
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,843
(grunts)

315
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:16,023
They’re gonna wish the bake sale
was a nose plug sale.

316
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,815
And it totally isn’t.

317
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,818
(all laughing)

318
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,395
Teens?

319
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,946
In Willie’s hidey hole?

320
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,449
I’ll mop up your blood
from the inside!

321
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,452
(all scream)

322
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,669
(alarm ringing)

323
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,379
We have a fire alarm
in the ventilation room!

324
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,300
I’ll check it out.

325
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,511
(door opens, closes)

326
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,971
(panting)

327
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,590

333
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,863
Martin just skipped past you
singing "Skip to My Lou,"

334
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,728
and you did nothing.

335
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,145
Can’t a guy enjoy
a catchy tune?

336
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,444

00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,112
Ow! Ow!

00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,736
I’m unclear
on what you want!

339
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,834
Is Martin working for Jimbo?

340
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,331

Yes what?

344
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,165
Ow!

345
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,423
Yes, sir.

(groans)

347
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,720
Lisa, are you
on a secure line?

348
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,089
I am.

349
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,256
You’re on a Bluetooth
cell phone,

350
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,604
the most vulnerable
device known to man.

351
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,259
But it looks so cool.

352
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,678
Listen, there’s
a mole inside CTU.

353
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,516
A mole?!

354
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,770
Yes, a mole.

355
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,311
Now, I don’t
have much time,

356
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,194
so I’m just gonna come
right out and say his name,

357
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,311
so get ready
to know his name.

358
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,357

♪ Skip, skip, skip to my Lou. ♪

360
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,533
(overlapping chatter)

361
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,947
Rice Krispie Treats?!

362
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,326
Way to phone it in,
Sarah Wiggum.

363
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,213
Excuse me, excuse me,
I’m in the sale.

364
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,120
I’m in the sale.

365
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,545
Okay, I kept
my end of the deal.

366
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,129
Release my friends.

367
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,298
All here, from
Asimov to Zarathustra.

368
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,637
Where’s Phobos?!

369
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,062
He’s with us now.

370
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,138
(groans)

371
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,137
We’re out of here.

372
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,308
Smell you later.

373
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,606
Three minutes
later, to be exact.

374
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,530
(beeping)

375
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,610
What have I done?

376
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:53,848
Raisin cake.

377
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,429
Who wants raisin cake?

378
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,474
Don’t worry, it’s not too moist.

379
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,728
Hmm?

380
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,310
(sighs)

381
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,396
Can I have some
more money?

382
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,321
I gave you ten dollars.

383
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,690
All the other moms
gave their husbands $20.

384
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,447
Well, all
the other husbands

385
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,279
don’t come home
dirty from fighting.

386
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,534
I had fight.

387
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,195
Lenny said his dad
is Hulk Hogan,

388
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,834
and I know he’s not.

389
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,700
Here’s five
more dollars.

390
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:19,867
(gasps)

391
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,915
(laughing)

392
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,039
Bart, are you all right?

393
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,245
Bart?!

394
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,544
Hey, I’m fine.
They haven’t made

395
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,957
a French horn yet
that can hurt me.

396
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,256
Now, I’m sending you
a picture of the bomb.

397
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,799
(grunting)

398
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,470
My God.

399
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,603
That’s a class-five
stench-dispersal unit.

400
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,470
We have to short
out that fan.

401
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,226
"H.D.W."

402
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,483
What’s that?

403
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,734
That’s the main valve

404
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,185
of the hot dog water
recirculation system.

405
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,776
There’s over 30 years
of wiener soakings in there.

406
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:53,993
Lis, you have
to release that water.

407
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,703
It’s the only way
to short out the fan.

408
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,703
But you and Willie
will drown.

409
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,155
Possibly,
but I can’t risk

410
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,504
Superintendent Chalmers
finding out about...

411
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,459
Finding out about what, Seymour?

412
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,419
Um, about how early press
coverage of the bake sale

413
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,041
is uniformly positive.

414
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,207
Once again, you have thoroughly
misgauged my response.

415
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,587
This is going on
your permanent record.

416
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,845
The hot dog water’s
going to push us into the fan!

417
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,819
And I just sharpened
those blades.

418
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:53,545
(weakly):
♪ Skip to my Lou...
my darling. ♪

419
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,882
Bart, I’ve got an idea.

420
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,638
As you’re dying,
jam the blades with your spine.

421
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Keep pitching. I’ll be back.

422
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,715

00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,398
Look!

426
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,574
A window to
a child’s watery grave!

427
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,784
Don’t worry,
I’ll free the boy.

428
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,025

00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,486

(gasps)

431
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,410
Damn it! This glass
is bulletproof.

432
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,827
There’s nothing
that can shatter it.

433
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,665
MARGE:
Yes, there is!

434
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,644
(beeping)

435
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,599
Huh?

436
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,099
Ooh, a thermos.

437
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,141
With seven cups of
coffee still in it.

438
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,184
Oh, wait, six.

439
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,597
Dad, that’s a bomb!

440
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,975
Here! It’s yours!

441
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,101
(panting)

442
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,058
(gasps)

443
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,188
How do I stop it?

444
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,235
Oh, that’s convenient.

445
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,573
(sighs)

446
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,025
SKINNER:
Thank goodness
this crisis was averted.

447
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,405
Nicely done, Lisa.

448
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,081
Hey, what about me?

449
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,450
I almost died,
and so did Willie.

450
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,286
(grunting)

451
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,081
Oh, leave me be.

452
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,535
I don’t want to live if I
have to clean up this mess.

453
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,926
Oh, my special
little guy.

454
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:24,181
I’m so glad
you’re okay.

455
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,564
Oh, I’m just glad you
taste like hot dogs.

456
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,399
(crowd gasps)

457
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,362
Good work, Lisa!

458
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,401
What about me?

459
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,404
Bart Simpson,
12 minutes ago,

460
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,026
you made an annoying
prank phone call to me.

461
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,032
All units, move in.

462
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,207
I pulled every single field
agent off all other cases

463
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,251
to track you down
and bring you to justice.

464
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:57,045
It was a tough decision, but I
think I made the right call.

465
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,720
(explosion)

466
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,551
(all gasp)

467
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,715
It’s okay,
that was Shelbyville.

468
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,803
(all sigh)

469
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,013
