{\an8}Are there at least games here?

103

{\an8}Gathering of American Messengers
for Evangelical Sports.

105

{\an8}-Sports?
-(chuckles)

106
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,020
{\an8}"Sports" stands for Strict Parental
Oversight Rather Than Sports.

fun comes from inside.

It isn't about what we actually do.

You're right, you're right, you're right.
Let's go.

00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,959
{\an8}I'm sorry, gang. I blew it.

117
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,625
{\an8}(groans) I hate it
when grown-ups call kids "gang."

118
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,125
{\an8}Don't worry about it, Mom.

119
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,966

on a great outing next weekend.

We're not a gang!
Gangs are cool!

-Nowhere scary.

Everything's fine.

130
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,794
We'll just wait here
for the tow truck.

131
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,378
That newborn has earrings!

132
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:44,085
-Mom, we're hungry.
-(groans)

133
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:48,217
I guess we could make a sprint
for one of these local establishments.

they do wrong.

00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:13,251
They're selling CDs in the restaurant!

140
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,041
-Back to the car!
-What can I get you?

141
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,665
Oh, I'll just have a side salad.

142
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,803
We have no side salad.

143
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,880
-Back to the car!
-Relax, Mom.

144
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,295
-Be adventurous.
-Yeah, just have fun.

145
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,965
Dad would.

146
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,643
(sighs)

147
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,602
What's the craziest thing on the menu?

148
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,892
(chuckles)
She means the most authentic.

149
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,056
Well, that would be

150
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,895
{\an8}the Zelzel Minchet Aletcha Wat.

151
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,475
-Then I'll have that!
-(all gasp)

152
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,700
Okay, Marge, you test-drove
a convertible once, you can do this.

00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,081

156
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,716
That's good gloop!

157
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,883
Mmm. Mmm.

158
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,638
I wish I lived in Ethiopia!

159
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,683
Exotic, vegetarian,

160
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,805
I can mention it in a college essay.

161
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,022
Mom, this is amazing!

162
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,193
(all chewing noisily)

163
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,192
Wait, wait, wait,
what is she eating?

164
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,824
They've never served me that dish,

165
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,990
and I wear indigenous
beaded headgear.

166
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,239
Oh, this?

167
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,910
It's just a little
Zelzel Minchet Aletcha Wat.

168
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,240
It's all I ever eat here.

169
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,544
(gasps)
They have prepared her a dish

170
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:37,249
-from the non-translated page!
-(gasps)

171
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,421
So grab a pancake
and slurp some slop!

172
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,840
Foodies, heed my call!

173
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,259
{\an8}Commence ripping and dipping!

174
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,836
(all chewing noisily)

175
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,335
So, did all of your cars break down?

176
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,758
Mom, they're here on purpose.
They're foodies.

177
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,438
Indeed. Our passion is to seek out
interesting foods,

178
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,938
savor their exotic flavors,
then blog about them.

179
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,611
Yes.

180
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,029
We discovered Korean barbecue
in this town.

181
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,438
Uh, before the Koreans?

182
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,947
Oh, sure they cook it,
but they don't get it.

183
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,240
"When you stick a pancake into
a friend's mouth, it's a goorsha."

184
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,196
Everybody goorsha!

185
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,906
ALL: Goorsha!

186
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,326
BART and LISA: Goorsha!
Goorsha! Goorsha! Goorsha!

187
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,044
-Goorsha! Goorsha!
-Goorsha! Goorsha!

188
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,844
-Goorsha!
-Marge, the kids are acting ethnic!

189
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,459
Relax, Homie.

190
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,505
Have some leftover
Galalalalalalalalah.

191
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,880
(grunting)

192
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,011
Oh, no.

193
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,264
I don't eat anything new
unless I've eaten it before.

194
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,268
Aw, come on, Dad, be a foodie.

195
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,100
You're already a fatty and a drunkie.

196
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,095
I don't want to think about food,
I want to like it.

197
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,898
Why drive across town

198
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,781
to savor a bowl of mystery mush

199
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,779
when there's four different
Krusty Burgers

200
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,491
we can see from our house?

201
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,571
Oh, and here's my favorite restaurant--

202
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,028
La Fridge.

203
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:58,617
It's open 24 hours a day
and there's no dress code.

204
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,252
What kind of American man

205
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,495
doesn't want to explore
global food culture?

206
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,297
And then brag about it
on the Internet.

207
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,801
We should start our own food blog.

208
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,763
(gasps)
The Three Mouthketeers.

209
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,255
Three?

210
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,177
You mean, one, two... me?

211
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,480

People are loving our list

239
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,559
of Springfield's top 99
Afghan restaurants.

240
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,269
I feel bad for all those places
that didn't make the cut.

241
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,270
All right, food nerds, reality check.

242
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,693
All the food in those pictures
is poop by now.

243
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,653
Minds blown, you're welcome.

244
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,244
Oh.

245
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,909
I'll remind you kids what real fun is.

246
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,618
<i>Hey, hey, kids! (laughs)</i>

247
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,409
<i>Krustyland has a new ride.</i>

248
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,993
<i>The Eyeballs of Death.</i>

249
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,788
<i>It only passed the safety panel</i>
<i>by a three-to-two vote.</i>

250
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,002
<i>And that third vote didn't come cheap.</i>

251
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,673
<i>(laughs)</i>

252
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:12,091
And I've got tickets
for the grand opening Saturday night.

253
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,511
-Whoa!
-(gasps) Cool.

254
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,590
Uh, kids, don't forget about
our special plans Saturday night.

255
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,428
Oh, sorry, Dad.

256
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,683
Our blog is so popular,
we got an invitation

257
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,345
to the most exclusive restaurant in town.

258
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,274
Kent Brockman himself

259
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,693
could only get a reservation
at 5:30 or 9:30.

260
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,233
(giggles)
It's called El Chemistri,

261
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,697
and they use science
to make the food.

262
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,780
<i>Behold... pine needle sorbet.</i>

263
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,616
(moaning)

264
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,123
Pine needle... sorbet?

265
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,535
Pine needle sorbet?

266
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:52,174
My kids do not eat sorbet--
they eat sherbet.

267
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,713
And they pronounce it "sherbert,"

268
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,546
and they wish it was ice cream.

269
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,131
Sorry, Dad,
this is our thing now.

270
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,007
Fine, blow off Fun Dad

271
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,644
and go eat your walrus mustaches
and deep-fried pixie wangs.

272
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,232
Don't be so jealous, Homie,

273
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,730
just because the kids are finally
having fun doing something with me.

274
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,324
Aah! Jealous? Me?

275
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,690
(chortles)

276
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,986
That is to laugh.

277
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,700
The very idea.

278
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,700
If anything... (laughs)

279
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,334
-you're the one who's jealous.
-Of what?

280
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,332
Of how much fun
I am to be around!

281
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,705
(sobs)

282
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,842
It's always a party

283
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,129
with Fun Dad!

284
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,173
(sobbing)

285
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,887
Too sad to walk.

286
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:47,931
Too sad and fun to walk.

287
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,732
-What are you doing?
-When I'm sad,

288
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,937
I make baseball bats.

289
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,624
Homie,
I don't want you to feel excluded.

290
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,788
Would you like to come with us
to dinner at El Chemistri?

291
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,500
Really?
You'd let me in on your thing?

292
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,080
Even though I think it's stupid?

293
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,626
Of course.

294
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,879
-Hand me that saw, Marge.
-Why?

295
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,421
When I'm happy,
I make birdhouses.

296
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,506
Kids, guess what.
Mom invited me to your fancy dinner.

297
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,932
-Cool.
-Awesome!

298
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,550
I guess Fun Dad is a foodie now.

299
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,218
BOTH:
Food Dad! Food Dad! Food Dad!

300
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,807
(groans)

301
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,153
(groaning)

302
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,478
I'm food bad boy Tony Bourdain.

303
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,975
There's nowhere I won't go
and nothing I won't eat,

304
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,608
as long as I'm paid in emeralds

305
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,534
and my hotel room has a bidet
that shoots warm champagne.

306
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,494
I'm here at a Singapore
street-food market

307
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,414
with famous blogging family,
the Three Mouthketeers.

308
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,964
Marge, you've got to try
some of this hang hir kuay chap.

309
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,919
Ooh, triple spicy barbecued stingray

310
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,090
stuffed with pig organs.

311
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,209
Fun Dad is a foodie now!

312
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,126
(munching loudly)

313
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,295
(swallows)

314
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,303
This is my thing
and always will be.

315
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,926
(munching loudly)

316
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,353
Food Dad! Food Dad! Food Dad!

317
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,403
Everything's more fun with Homer.

318
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,861
(speaking faux Swedish)

319
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,537
But this was all I had.

320
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,289
BRITISH MAN:
Stop your bloody whinging, Marge.

321
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,122
Aah! Gordon Ramsay!

322
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,327
You (bleep) it up,
big blue, didn't you?

323
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,378
Why did you invite Homer?
He stole your bloody thunder.

324
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,632
You're not as (bleep) fun as him,
and you never will be.

325
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,376
(crying)

326
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,137
Darling, darling, crying's not fun.
Homer's fun.

327
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,060
-Now, get out of my dream.
-It's my dream.

328
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,560
Not anymore it's not.
Ramsay, awake.

329
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,231
What in the hell was that?

330
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,112
(gasps, sighs)

331
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,479
Fun me. Fun me. Fun me.

332
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,238
Kids, I was thinking,
was it really such a great idea

333
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,071
to invite your father to that dinner?

334
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,946
Relax.
Dad will be the life of the party.

335
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,744
He'll be the fourth Mouthketeer.

336
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,327
But there weren't four Musketeers.

337
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:18,173
Yeah-huh. Athos, Porthos,
Aramis, and d'Artagnan.

338
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,840
D'Artagnan wasn't a Musketeer.

339
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,670
He only had a letter of introduction
to the captain of the guards--

340
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,587
which he lost!

341
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,006
You know, I'm pretty excited
about this far-out dinner.

342
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,255
-Maybe I'll like it.
-Oh, I doubt it.

343
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,018
You sit at communal tables
full of hipsters.

344
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,810
Well, actually,
I've come around on hipsters.

345
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,194
Takes a lot of guts
to all wear the same hat.

346
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,571
And the food
will all be weird foams--

347
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,189
cooked with chemicals
or served in a test tube.

348
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,856
It's too crazy for you.

349
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,605
So it's weird.
Don't worry, I'll make it fun.

350
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,947
Yeah, you always do.

351
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,043
Well, here's where to meet us.

352
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:56,078
1501 W...

353
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,293
East Oak Street.

354
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,384
East Oak Street. Is that it?

355
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,089
Uh... yes.

356
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,749
Yes, East Oak Street.

357
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,507
That's where you should go.
See you there.

358
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,177
Don't you judge me.

359
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,050
Ah, save it for the sitter.

360
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,639
Welcome to El Chemistri.

361
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,944
Pease place these mints
in your mouth,

362
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,728
and when your table is ready,
they will vibrate.

363
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,816
Ooh.

364
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,654
{\an8}(dog howling)

365
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,027
Here it is-- 1501 East Oak.

366
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,825
No name on the door--
very trendy.

367
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,787
What do you want?

368
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,620
Is this the chemical kitchen place
where you do the crazy cooking?

369
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,127
Quiet, man.

370
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,378
The experience begins.

371
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,205
Where's Dad?

372
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,416
Uh... I don't know.

373
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,257
Probably changed his mind

374
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,972
and stopped off for doughnuts.

375
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,722
(chuckles)

376
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,805
Before you is
a deconstructed Caesar salad--

377
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,402
romaine lettuce gel, egg yolk ice,

378
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,938
crouton foam, and anchovy air.

379
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,403
You eat it like this--

380
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:08,492
gel, ice, foam, air,
foam, ice, gel, foam, air.

381
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,700
Just like Marge said--
chemicals and test tubes.

382
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,543
The open kitchen is a nice touch.

383
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,078
I guess I'll get started
before my family gets here.

384
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,873
How much for a taste?
You know, just to get me going.

385
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,667
-50 bucks.
-Ouch.

386
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,791
This place is fancy.

387
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,958
The next course is Regret.

388
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,007
(delighted moans)

389
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,888
(moaning)

390
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,023
(chuckling) Hipsters.

391
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,980
Too cool for school.

392
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,311
You don't look like
the kind of guy who does this.

393
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,686
Well, my wife thinks
it's too crazy for me,

394
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,734
but I'm going to prove her wrong.

395
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,987
(chuckles)
I'm doing this for my family.

396
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,002
All right, Breaking Baddies,
drop the meth.

397
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,336
Pick up the meth!
Pick up the meth!

398
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,508
(gasps)
This better be dinner theater!

399
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,718
And now, pork chops 100 ways.

400
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,930
(diners oohing)

401
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,638
100 pork chops!

402
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,852
I can't believe Dad is missing this.

403
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,143
Sure, your dad's great,
but I'm fun, too.

404
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,848
Look at me eat, huh?

405
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,188
(munching loudly)
D'oh. D'oh. D'oh.

406
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,688
Who am I kidding?
I'm not enjoying this.

407
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,068
Even the foam tastes like nothing.

408
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,865
(sighs)
I'm calling Homer.

409
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,329
(cell phone chimes)

410
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,698
<i>HOMER (on phone):</i>
<i>Marge! This isn't a food restaurant!</i>

411
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,746
<i>-It's a meth restaurant!</i>
<i>-(gunshots)</i>

412
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,290
<i>A meth-taurant! Aah!</i>

413
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,714
(gasps)
Foodies, help me!

414
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,133
My husband's in danger!

415
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,261
-Oh, we can't leave now.
-We haven't had the root vegetables

416
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,719
cooked in the perfect vacuum
of outer space.

417
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,340
They say you can't even
understand parsnips

418
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,467
until you had zero-g parsnips.

419
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,385
(groans)

420
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,603
How dare you walk out on me!

421
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,854
Your dessert is in this doggie bag

422
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:09,226
woven from the silk of
a blueberry-fed spider.

423
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,324
Take it and go!

424
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,280
-(sirens whooping)
-(police radio chatter)

425
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,700
Ah, shucks.

426
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,818
We get the family dressed up
to go to our favorite meth lab,

427
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,736
and it's all raided out.

428
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,075
-(children groan)
-Oh, honey,

429
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,161
I always liked
your home-cooked better anyways.

430
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,537
Aw.

431
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,883
Uh, where do you think
you're going?

432
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:32,049
A wife needs to tell her husband
she was wrong.

433
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,959
And in you go.

434
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,837
(whimpering)

435
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,474
Sorry.

436
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,221
Everything you've done here
has created problems.

437
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,465
(grunts)

438
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,098
(gasps)
I've got to save him.

439
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,975
(gasps)
Ooh. My dessert.

440
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,823
Eat deconstructed apple pie!

441
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,070
(grunts)

442
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,781
(swallows)

443
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,401
(sighs)

444
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,454
{\an8}<i>Merci, Maman,</i>
<i>pour la tarte tatin à la mode.</i>

445
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,542
(sighs)

446
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,797
Oh, Marge,

447
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,762
you saved me
from the danger you put me in.

448
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,643
I am so happy and angry.

449
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,221
I'm sorry.

450
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,426
I guess I just wanted
the kids to look at me

451
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,886
-the way they look at you.
-Aw.

452
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,517
Wow, Mom!
That was awesome.

453
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,265
We ate mad-scientist food

454
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,897
and broke up a meth lab
in the same day.

455
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,744
Fun Mom! Fun Mom! Fun Mom!

456
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,544
Now, that's my kind of foam.

457
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,119
This is nice.

458
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,254
A family fun day.

459
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,621
Here's 50 bucks.

460
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,497
For the next two hours,
I don't want to know you exist.

461
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,995
(laughing)

462
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,127
Family fun day.
