1
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:17,084
Haw‐haw! Green screen.

2
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,475
Lenny,
I didn't know you had kids.

3
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:42,809
I don't.

4
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,811
I hired them to look like
I'm a family man.

5
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,813
How you doing, Lenny Jr.?

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,216
Never better, Lenny Sr.

7
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:51,184
Hey, I just got cast

8
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,886
as Krusty's kid
at a custody hearing.

9
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:54,121
Possible recurring.

10
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,423
Later, loser!

11
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,125
Kids.

12
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,695
Welcome, iso‐tots.

13
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,196
Are you having fun?

14
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,335
Excellent. Now, as your parents
leave you alone with me,

15
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:11,138
let's begin the festivities.

16
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,075
Yes, there they go. Bye‐bye.

17
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:17,144
Last mommy out. Excellent.

18
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,579
I now declare the start

19
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:21,415
of Put Your Kids to Work Day.

20
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:49,876
This plant has over 17,000
contaminated crevices

21
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,312
that only your tiny hands
can reach.

22
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,747
Get to work, slackers.

23
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,116
At least this ride
doesn't have a creepy song.

24
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:59,419
<i>You'll work for me,
or you'll get the lash</i>

25
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:03,323
<i>You won't get dental,
health or cash</i>

26
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,525
No!

27
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:09,463
Even Mr. Burns
can't get away with this.

28
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,666
Oh, Monty, you've still got it.

29
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,235
That was like taking
eight hours of work from a baby.

30
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,572
Mr. Burns, according to
the child labor laws

31
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,107
of the United States...

32
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,075
Accountability?

33
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:27,114
In this game of cat and mouse,

34
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,683
I'm afraid Mr. Mouse
is far smarter than...

35
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,220
I know you're in here,

36
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,521
and nothing will stop me.

37
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,423
Wait, this is a men's room.

38
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,694
Is that a tuna sandwich
on the sink?

39
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:44,197
Gross, gross, gross!

40
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:49,102
Oh, employee cave drawings.

41
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,680
Let's see
what's on their feeble minds.

42
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,240
There once was a lady
from China...

43
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,875
And North Carolina.

44
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,743
I assume what's in between
is unimportant.

45
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,879
There!

46
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,248
Someone drew a big,
crying cucumber. That's nice.

47
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,417
Something about me.

48
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,053
I'll need my cheaters for this.

49
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,058
What?

50
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,229
They hate me.

51
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,765
Well, maybe things are better
in the ladies' room.

52
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,102
Effigies can be burned?

53
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,246
You should have seen

54
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,172
those hateful graffitos,
Smithers.

55
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,107
And the drawing of me
was so off‐model.

56
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:29,109
I wouldn't worry, sir.

57
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,043
Our workers
are pretty well‐pacified.

58
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,113
- Intimidation.
- Alleged intimidation.

59
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:37,751
- Beatings.
- Alleged beatings.

60
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,252
The poisonings.

61
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,787
Ah, yes.

62
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:43,623
We've had some alleged good
times, haven't we, Smithers?

63
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,127
But there is an undercurrent
of contempt for me.

64
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,562
No, there isn't.

65
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,864
You said Burns
is worse than Hitler.

66
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,532
Well, not worse at his job
than Hitler,

67
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,633
but a worse person.

68
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,369
Was that the work whistle?

69
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,438
Who cares.

70
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:01,041
Everywhere,
I'm surrounded by malcontents,

71
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,576
termagants and Lennys.

72
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,545
Well, we could show the workers
some actual respect,

73
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:06,972
considering
how many have died.

74
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:12,419
Or I could go undercover
and infiltrate the workers.

75
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,421
I'm beginning to suspect

76
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,389
these monitors
have been tampered with.

77
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:18,692
I've assembled
a world‐class team

78
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,061
to create
your undercover disguise.

79
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:24,064
The face mask specialist from
the Mission Impossible movies.

80
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:27,367
I made Ving Rhames
look like Kristin Chenoweth.

81
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,703
I don't know any of those words,
but I'm impressed.

82
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,372
We'll also provide you
with a dynamic new body.

83
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,742
Does everything work?

84
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,511
Everything
that works for you now.

85
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,746
Damn it! That's only two things.

86
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,749
And we top off the disguise
with a voice modulation chip.

87
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,851
Mr. Burns,
I'm gonna make you sound...

88
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:47,721
hella different.

89
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,790
Oh, yeah.

90
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,292
Let's get to work.

91
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,165
Oh, my God. It's extraordinary.

92
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:01,802
You now have the body and face
of a man half your age.

93
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,104
78? Now, enough gallimaufry.

94
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,405
I want to see my reflection.

95
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,073
Someone bring me
a mountain stream.

96
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,710
Say goodbye to Montgomery Burns.

97
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:14,815
Say hello to Fred Kranepool
from turbine maintenance.

98
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,052
Excellent.

99
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,827
Hello, Joe. What do you know?

100
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,428
Just got back
from the picture show.

101
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,729
Beat it, weirdo.

102
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,198
You're fired.

103
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,666
You can't fire me.

104
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,068
Hey, newbie. Over here.

105
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,737
Homer Simpson.

106
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,706
Fred...

107
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,241
No, that's not it.

108
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,344
Fred Kranepool.

109
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,113
You seem like a happy lot
here at the nuclear plant,

110
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,782
suckling from the teat

111
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,585
of the great
C. Montgomery Burns.

112
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,787
You said teat.

113
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:57,290
Yes, I did, didn't I?

114
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,758
Now that we're chums,

115
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,193
what's on your mind?

116
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,662
Any complaints?
Insubordinate remarks?

117
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,340
Actually, now that
you mention it...

118
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,199
Yes...?

119
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:08,802
Better get back to work.

120
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,370
Ah, so soon?

121
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,305
Sorry, but Mr. Burns
has a special way

122
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,074
of telling you
your lunchtime's over.

123
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,647
I heard the craziest thing.

124
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,250
Some nuclear plants
don't have hounds chasing you.

125
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,051
Eh, different world.

126
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,158
I guess when you're on
the other side of it,

127
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,427
releasing hounds can be cruel?

128
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,496
Oh, yeah. Super cruel.

129
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,603
I had to get rabies shots
in my stomach for a month.

130
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:41,201
Skipped the last couple.

131
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:44,537
You poor guys.
Here, please.

132
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,173
Here's a Buffalo nickel
for each of you.

133
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,575
Hey, thanks a lot, man.

134
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,577
Why don't you join us
at Moe's tonight?

135
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,579
Moe's?

136
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,414
Yeah, it's that bar
that was featured

137
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,249
on I'll Drink
What Phil's Drinking

138
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,784
with Phil Rosenthal.

139
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,787
What animal
is this egg from?

140
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,823
I want to say horse?

141
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,092
Could I be sick in this?

142
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,430
Somebody take Phil
to the hospital.

143
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,632
Fred, buddy, you coming?

144
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:15,435
I'm in.
Just need to signal Smithers.

145
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,880
I hate that signal.

146
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,983
Moe, this is our new pal Fred.

147
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,018
Apparently, we've been working
with him for years.

148
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,686
We never noticed.

149
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,888
Set him up with a beer.
On me.

150
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,526
Fred!

151
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,962
Thank you, friend.

152
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,564
I like the way you said that,

153
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,034
like it was a foreign concept
or something.

154
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,904
You know,

155
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,374
it might be
John Barleycorn talking,

156
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,143
but you annoying fleas
aren't half bad.

157
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,380
All we're looking for is
a little friendship and respect.

158
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:02,348
All right.

159
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,950
To friendship and respect.

160
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:07,320
And also evil.
I mean, I mean, football.

161
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,489
Football!

162
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,861
Sorry, Barn.
Your seat's taken.

163
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,863
Oh, you show up late

164
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,766
for your nightly
bender just once...

165
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,334
Don't you worry.

166
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:24,871
I just instituted
drive‐through service.

167
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,407
Drive safely.

168
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,609
<i>Why can't we be friends?</i>

169
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,412
<i>Why can't we be friends?</i>

170
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:35,448
<i>Why can't we be friends?</i>

171
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,017
<i>Why can't we be friends?</i>

172
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:42,655
<i>I see you 'round
for a long, long time</i>

173
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,526
<i>I remember you</i>

174
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,995
<i>When you drink my wine</i>

175
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,530
<i>Why can't we be friends?</i>

176
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:53,733
<i>Why can't we be friends?</i>

177
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,135
<i>Why can't we be friends?</i>

178
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,706
<i>Why can't we be friends?</i>

179
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,841
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

180
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,843
Okay,
your turn to sing, Fred.

181
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,812
Fred! Fred! Fred!

182
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,780
Very well.

183
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,316
I've got a toe‐tapper
everyone can sing along with.

184
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,752
The Spaniard That Blighted
My Life.

185
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,755
The Spaniard That Blighted
My Life, BLH1493. Go.

186
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,825
<i>List to me, while I tell you</i>

187
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,660
<i>Of the Spaniard
that blighted my life...</i>

188
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,861
Everybody!

189
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,464
<i>List to me, while I tell you</i>

190
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:28,334
<i>Of the man that pinched
my future wife</i>

191
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:32,805
Those idiots like me
for me, Fred Kranepool.

192
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,340
Sir, I'm worried.

193
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,808
The suit just detected
a heartbeat.

194
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,944
I'm turning you off.

195
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,046
- Other button, sir.
- Shut up.

196
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,789
Where is he?

197
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,591
I'm supposed to read him
his bedtime story.

198
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,795
Smithers, what are you
still doing up?

199
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:58,398
I was worried about you, sir.

200
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,835
Worried?

201
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,638
I just had the greatest night
of my life.

202
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,974
- With my friends.
- What?

203
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,809
Oh, you should've
seen it, Smithers.

204
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,844
They enjoyed my company.

205
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,647
I've had frenemies, but
they were all French enemies.

206
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,517
Never a friend.

207
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,819
I think of you
as more than a friend, sir.

208
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,196
What did I tell you
about thinking?

209
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,589
Well, did you find anything out?

210
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,158
Any scuttlebutt from the union?

211
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:28,528
The only union that concerns me
now is the union of men.

212
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,530
What would you know about that?

213
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,701
Where have you been?
You missed dinner.

214
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,771
There's this really cool new guy
at the plant.

215
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:42,575
You know what's cool is
spending time with your family.

216
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,777
- That's not cool.
- Yeah, Mom, it really isn't.

217
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,847
I agree with Mom
on everything but this.

218
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,782
I'm sorry. Definitely not cool.

219
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,451
Oh, all right, all right.

220
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:54,620
I just don't trust new people
in this town.

221
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,723
Like Lady Gaga?
She came, she inspired Lisa

222
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,426
and we never heard
from her again.

223
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,395
Who needs friends like that?

224
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,464
So, fellows,

225
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,732
what's on our
social agenda tonight?

226
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,535
More galivanting, I hope?

227
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,404
Well, we really should do
a little work.

228
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,739
Yeah. I have a whole inbox
of unsplit atoms

229
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,408
I haven't gotten to yet.

230
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:16,976
Fred, are these men
bothering you?

231
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,846
Oh, back off, Smithers.

232
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,748
I'll box your ears next time you
speak to me with such insolence.

233
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,851
Yes, sir.

234
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,019
Oh, my God.

235
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,422
You totally pwned him.

236
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,757
I suppose I did pwn him.

237
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,426
I did.

238
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,061
That was quite
the kerfuffle.

239
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,430
I better go take
a three‐hour nap.

240
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,641
No, no, wait. While Smithers
is off drowning his sorrows

241
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:43,169
in a pamplemousse Perrier,
Burns is unprotected.

242
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,746
This is the perfect time
for you to represent us

243
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,572
and hit the old skinflint up

244
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,783
for a decent benefits package.

245
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,675
Me, talk to Burns?

246
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,444
Oh, I wouldn't. I couldn't.

247
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:54,046
He's got the sharpest mind
in all 46 states.

248
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,582
Hey, come on, please.
For your friends.

249
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,417
I won't let you down.

250
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,586
You down, you down, you down.

251
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,424
I'll help you, friends.

252
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,059
Don't you understand, Burns?

253
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,362
Without the workers,
this plant is nothing.

254
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,696
If you give them respect,

255
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,398
it comes back to you
a hundredfold.

256
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,634
Respect the workers?

257
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,970
What next? Put batteries
in the smoke detectors?

258
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,740
Have you no heart?

259
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,375
I certainly do.

260
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,977
I'm not flooding this room
with mustard gas right now.

261
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,648
I'll give you a chance to tell
your buddies that you failed.

262
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:32,885
But then they might not
like me anymore.

263
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,988
You're right. Friendship
is something worth treasuring.

264
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,559
Boy, he's really raking Burns
over the coals.

265
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,603
Yeah, I like how they're not
interrupting each other.

266
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,729
- So polite.
- Yes, spirits, yes.

267
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,765
I'll give them
everything they want.

268
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,434
- He said...
- We heard everything.

269
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,169
Clearly it was
two people talking.

270
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,104
We got to spread the good news.

271
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:55,775
We love you, big guy.

272
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,411
Mr. Burns, what have you done?

273
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,479
There is no Mr. Burns.

274
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,381
Only Fred.

275
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,448
What are you saying?

276
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,053
Montgomery Burns died
when I put on this suit.

277
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,854
And six other times this week.

278
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,357
Thank God for the new liver
and kidneys.

279
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:14,694
Wait up, guys!
Beers are on me!

280
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,062
I might have two tonight.

281
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,364
That's right, two sips!

282
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:24,437
Hope you're hungry, Homer.

283
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,440
I got up at 2:00 a.m. and
slow‐roasted a breakfast turkey.

284
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,642
Sorry, no time for food.
I got to get to work.

285
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,551
When did Homer turn into someone
who wants to go into work?

286
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,519
Oh, no. It's in the air.

287
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,422
Now I want to go to school
and make something of myself.

288
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,560
Hey, work is amazing now.

289
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:50,496
A magical place where we get
what we deserve and more.

290
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,531
And it's all due to Fred.

291
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,434
Okay, so when are we gonna
meet this Fred?

292
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,503
Oh, you've already
met him, Marge,

293
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,006
in the smile on my face.

294
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:04,377
Should we tell him
it's a Saturday?

295
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,012
Eh, not yet.

296
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,547
At least we'll get some
of the roast turkey for once.

297
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,883
<i>I don't want to work</i>

298
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,121
<i>I want to bang
on the drum all day</i>

299
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,556
<i>I don't want to play</i>

300
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:21,460
<i>I just want to bang
on the drum all day</i>

301
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,030
<i>I don't want to work</i>

302
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,832
<i>I want to bang
on the drum all day</i>

303
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,435
Hey, Homer. Look what Fred
made Burns give us

304
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:30,870
to handle plutonium.

305
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,039
Look at me.
I'm Audrey Hepburn.

306
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,845
Lenny Leonard,
you have exquisite vision

307
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,113
and you know it.
Give me those.

308
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,083
Oh, I don't care what you think,
'cause Fred doesn't like you.

309
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,885
And once Fred gets around to it,

310
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,421
you ain't gonna be
working here no more.

311
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,426
I've had enough.
Simpson, come with me.

312
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:54,660
What the...?

313
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,563
There's something
you don't know about

314
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,998
your good friend Fred.

315
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,900
I know everything
I need to know

316
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:04,303
about Fred whatshisname
from wherever he comes.

317
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:12,378
Oh, my God.

318
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,680
That's right. Fred is Mr. Burns.

319
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,849
But wait a minute.
Isn't that a good thing?

320
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,751
It means he's nice to us now.

321
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,786
His niceness is gonna
put us out of business.

322
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,389
These giveaways
are bankrupting us.

323
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:24,600
What should we give
our friends next, Fred?

324
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:27,393
Morning yoga? Irish brides?

325
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,895
Okay, maybe the yoga
is going too far.

326
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,430
It's all too far.

327
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:32,841
We're gonna go the way
of the Sears catalog

328
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,466
and 20th Century Fox.

329
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:38,571
Are you sure this isn't
because you miss the old Burns?

330
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:41,073
Of course I miss him.
Who wouldn't?

331
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,842
Simpson, if you care
about your job,

332
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,643
and the jobs of everyone
in this plant,

333
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,812
you'll end your friendship
with Mr. Burns.

334
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,814
- Permanently.
- No problem.

335
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,016
As long as I'm still friends
with Fred.

336
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,985
Burns is Fred.

337
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,988
Wha...? Oh, he is not.

338
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,195
- What's wrong, Homie?
- Not much.

339
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:06,565
I lost a friend today because
Burns stepped out of him.

340
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,867
- What?
- Well, let's just say

341
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,078
I can't be
friends with Fred anymore

342
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,770
but I don't know
how to tell him.

343
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,272
Well, don't ask me.
I suck at it.

344
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:14,873
That's why I can't shake
Milhouse.

345
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,942
I'm right here, Bart.

346
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,044
Our sleepover ended
two days ago.

347
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,246
I'll call my mom again.

348
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,424
- Hey, Fred.
- Ahoy‐hoy.

349
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,927
Listen, Fred, we can't really
hang out with you anymore.

350
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:39,264
No offense. I mean, it's just
that I got to focus on work.

351
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:44,303
My console's
under here somewhere.

352
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:45,837
Hey, Fred!

353
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,064
The man of the hour.

354
00:16:47,105 --> 00:16:49,474
We were just working
on a list of new things

355
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,476
you can get
Old Man Burns to give us.

356
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,912
What do you mean
Old Man Burns?

357
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,948
I mean, he's so old.

358
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:57,883
Fossilized scarecrow.

359
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,020
You know, I've never seen Fred
and Burns at the same time.

360
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,323
Which means you must
hate Burns too.

361
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:07,226
Ooh, well, we don't
really hate him.

362
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,894
Mr. Burns is a withered
old corn husk

363
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,862
with a rotten apple for a head,

364
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,273
and I'm getting special clogs
made up

365
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,899
so I can Riverdance
on his grave.

366
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,438
You ungrateful jackals.

367
00:17:19,504 --> 00:17:21,340
Smithers,
where's the kill button?

368
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:23,175
There isn't one, sir.

369
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,177
How many times have I told you,

370
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,279
everything must have
a kill button?

371
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,881
Unhand me, you ape!

372
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,284
Why am I always referred to
as an ape?

373
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,920
Never a gorilla or an orangutan.

374
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,089
Aw, monkey want a banana?

375
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:40,926
Why, you incredibly complex...

376
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,263
I thought

377
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:45,831
you were

378
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:47,432
my friends.

379
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,802
Someone's having a day.

380
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,874
Fred, you traitor.

381
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,809
You've turned my employees
against me.

382
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,845
Yeah, but they love me.

383
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:01,847
And soon, there'll be no you.

384
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:03,915
Just Fred!

385
00:18:09,821 --> 00:18:13,725
As all my attorneys keep
telling me, why won't you die?

386
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:17,195
Because I'm the last spark
of goodness in you.

387
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,264
It can't be extinguished!

388
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,233
I'm glad
I went to the bathroom in you.

389
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,768
En garde.

390
00:18:29,841 --> 00:18:33,412
Die, die. Die, die.

391
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:36,281
It's okay, Mr. Burns.
Fred's gone.

392
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,118
Oh, why can't I be loved
and feared?

393
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,287
- Like God?
- Why?

394
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,756
Because you're the boss,
we're the workers.

395
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,758
It goes back to caveman days.

396
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,761
Ten guys killed the mammoth
while the boss yelled at them.

397
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:53,131
Then the boss got all the meat
and they got all the toenails.

398
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:57,069
Because that's the way
life works.

399
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:59,805
Next came the Renaissance, and
the invention of the time clock,

400
00:18:59,871 --> 00:19:02,207
which meant the boss
no longer had to waste time

401
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,775
checking on his employees

402
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,078
and could become pope
and marry his sister.

403
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:10,349
With recent times came unions
and workers' rights.

404
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:13,752
Which were then taken away
in even more recent times.

405
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,220
Wrap it up, Homer.

406
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,722
That catwalk
is starting to buckle.

407
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,193
My point is, no matter what,
Mr. Burns,

408
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:24,796
the boss sucks,
so why shouldn't you?

409
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,432
Why indeed.

410
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,868
Back to work,
and everything nice is canceled.

411
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,270
- Does that include...
- If you have to ask,

412
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,739
it's canceled.

413
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,074
And Fred, the man
I could've been,

414
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:39,511
I consign to the fires of hell.

415
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,818
Somebody stop it.
No, no, no, too late.

416
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,855
- Oh, poor Fred.
- It's a costume, you idiot.

417
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:52,057
A lot of work goes into those.

418
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,359
Good to have you back, sir.

419
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:55,927
Good to... Oh, Smithers.

420
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,296
I left my car fob in that suit.
Go get it.

421
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,298
But that's certain death, sir.

422
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:04,202
- Yes, but for you.
- You're back.

423
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,371
Or am I?

424
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,711
Attention, everyone.

425
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,513
This is your new coworker
Don Phoneyman.

426
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,682
Please show him the ropes.

427
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,684
I'm not going through this
again. Come on.

428
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,986
We know it's you, Mr. Burns,
and we'll prove it.

429
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,455
Release the hounds.
They won't touch you.

430
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,726
Well, what do you know?
He's real.

431
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:30,295
I didn't know we could
call the hounds.

432
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,197
We can also operate
the trapdoor.

433
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,800
I'll get you for this!

434
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:53,985
Engage karaoke mode.

435
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:57,155
<i>List to me while I tell you</i>

436
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,825
<i>Of the Spaniard
that blighted my life</i>

437
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,696
<i>List to me, while I tell you</i>

438
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,999
<i>Of the man that
pinched my future wife</i>
