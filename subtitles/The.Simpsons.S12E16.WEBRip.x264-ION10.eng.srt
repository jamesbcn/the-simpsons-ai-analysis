That's right, kids.

Oh, it's tough being the new kid.

Someone should go talk to her.

Yeah, somebody should.

OK, with the window bars,

your total cost would be...

00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,633
They're not dolls,
they're aspiration figures.

183
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,962
But it might work.

184
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,707
That baby-proofing crook wanted to sell us

185
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,967
safety covers for the electrical outlets.

186
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,720
But I'll just draw bunny faces on them

187
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,972
to scare Maggie away.

188
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,982
She's not afraid of bunnies.

189
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,349
She will be.

190
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,691
Uh, Francine?

191
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:46,192
I think we got off to a bad start so...

192
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,695
Hey-- you like Malibu Stacey, too?

193
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,409
Oh, yeah.

194
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,869
(gasps) And you like the same one I like--

195
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,740
with the "Grad-student Glamour Pack"

196
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,446
just like the one in my...

197
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,082
locker.

198
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,076
That's mine, isn't it?

199
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,634
Tastes like yours.

200
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,052
(whimpering)

201
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,547
How about jazz?

202
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,005
Do you like jazz?

203
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,925
MILHOUSE: I like jazz.

204
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,563
Milhouse? She got you, too?

205
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,311
Yeah. But it's not so bad--

206
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,643
I'm standing on Ralph.

207
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,347
We're a totem pole!

208
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,897
(chanting): Hiya, hiya, hoya, hiya!

209
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,861
(whistling)

210
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,653
And, and, there.

211
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,276
See, honey, Daddy's protecting you

212
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,494
from all the sharp scary things.

213
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,405
-Here, hold this a sec.
-(Maggie coos)

214
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,663
-(nail gun firing)
-Ow!

215
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,327
Oh, my...

216
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,663
(cooing)

217
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,577
Oow!

218
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,455
OK, Maggie, put it down.

219
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,753
-D'oh! O-OK, now.
-(giggling)

220
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:48,957
Put-- D'oh!

221
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,086
It--

222
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,472
down. D-ohh!

223
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,759
Oh! (laughs)

224
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,472
OK, that's quite enough.

225
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,932
{\an8}It's not funny anymore.

226
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,722
D-ohh! D-ohh!

227
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,220
(gasping)

228
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,097
No, no, no!

229
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,813
Oh, Homie.

230
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,097
Ow.

231
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,976
Ooh! Ow, ow, ow.

232
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:09,283
Now do you realize how unsafe
the American home is?

233
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,608
Baby accidents occur every three minutes.

234
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,485
I'm the one who told you that.

235
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,202
Yeah, but this is me talking.

236
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,082
Look, I've already encased
the telephone in concrete.

237
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,535
How are you supposed to dial?

238
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,751
Reach into these holes.

239
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,170
I use a carrot.

240
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,418
Isn't that a little excessive?

241
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,589
I mean, how are the buttons dangerous?

242
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,248
Baby could order poison.

243
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,297
Oh, that's ridiculous.

244
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,046
MALE CLERK: <i>Poison Delivery Service.</i>

245
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,724
<i>A gift basket of poisons is on its way.</i>

246
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,723
Oh, I'm a horrible mother.

247
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,805
Of course you are.

248
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,021
Marge, I've finally discovered
the reason God made me...

249
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:48,362
to protect his tiniest,
most breakable creatures.

250
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,479
And I've got to share
that gift with the <i>world.</i>

251
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,817
-Ow!
-(Marge gasps)

252
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,453
Get her out of here.

253
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,372
(Nelson grunting)

254
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,948
Why you throwing tomatoes
at yourself, huh?

255
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,954
Why you throwing tomatoes at yourself?

256
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,906
{\an8}Your very question is faulty.

257
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,366
<i>You're </i>faulty.

258
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,134
Knock-knock...

259
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,089
What do <i>you </i>want?

260
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,959
Would you bullies be interested
in some bodyguard work?

261
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,717
Oh, this is so funny.

262
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,009
We were just talking about
moving into protection.

263
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,053
We're offering a recess-and-lunch package

264
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,636
that's very affordable.

265
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,221
Well, I'm going to need full coverage.

266
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,846
My bully is highly aggressive.

267
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,353
Check out these Indian burns.

268
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,144
-Good technique.
-Wow, check it out.

269
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,018
Triple twist. Nice work.

270
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,066
You sure this was done by hand?

271
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,899
Yeah, she's a real purist.

272
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:34,904
She?

273
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,775
Sorry, we don't do girls.

274
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,322
They bite and kick and scratch.

275
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,616
And sometimes we fall in love.

276
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,700
(all sigh)

277
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,374
{\an8}Wow... there's so much I don't
understand about bullying.

278
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,083
Yeah... there's a lot of history there.

279
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,634
Did you know it predates agriculture?

280
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,749
-Mm-hmm.
-Let's walk.

281
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,339
Finish the job.

282
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
(grunting)

283
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,085
I just don't understand
Francine's motivation.

284
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,086
Whoa!

285
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,797
Whaa!

286
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,887
(humming)

287
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,354
Why does she only go after the smart ones?

288
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,645
That's like asking
the square root of a million.

289
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,269
No one will ever know.

290
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,515
Someone will.

291
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,606
I'm going to crack the bully code.

292

And I've got the perfect solution.

298
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,082
Oh, thank you.

299
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,707
No more Shiva-related pokings.

300
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,884
Yeah, you know down the line,
you might want to switch

301
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,723
to a nice, round Buddha.

302
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,628
Oh!

303
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,086
But... we are Hindu.

304
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,256
So am I, but I don't

Ach! 'Tis a mighty puddle of puke.

315
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,931
I'm sorry.

316
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,141
Ah, that's all right, lad.

317
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,932
It reminds me why I got
into this business.

318
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:32,386
Willie, I need to see
the school security tapes.

319
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:36,518
Security tapes? There's no security tapes.

320
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,857
{\an8}It's hard to miss the cameras.

321
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,855
{\an8}Aye... Willie's a stinkin' liar.

322
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,663
Why does the school need
to watch us all the time?

323
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,577
School?

324
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,705
Oh, here's the tape I need.

325
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,250
Oh, my God!

326
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,456
That roll of towels is nearin' the end!

327
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:04,088
Ach! It's on double red stripe!

328
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,728
How did she know I was there?

329
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,825
{\an8}Hey, that time she looked right
at me and didn't touch me.

330
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,368
Hmm...

331
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,249
Of course! The nose clip.

332
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,919
Hey, Willie, I think I'm on to something.

333
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,045
Check this out.

334
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,222
Not talking, eh, Willie?

335
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,301
Just listen, then.

336
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,255
I think I figured out

337
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,265
what sets off that big ape, Francine.

338
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,558
Willie?

339
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,690
Willie? Whoa!

340
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:59,059
(punches landing)

341
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,438
<i>Yeah!</i>

342
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,158
(all panting and grunting)

343
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,320
Come on, people.

344
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,487
Move it. I want to see some sweat.

345
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,746
I am not mastering another stair

346
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:17,368
until you explain the purpose
of this monstrous experiment.

347
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,248
I believe the key to bully-nerd antagonism

348
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,996
lies in your drippings.

349
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,547
Then I shall drip like a pot roast.

350
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,972
Excellent.

351
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,840
Now don't mind the squeegee.

352
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,930
Ah.

353
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,265
Ah, the scraping seems wrong

354
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,141
but it feels so right.

355
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,725
And so, as Heavyweight Champion

356
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:45,315
recognized by nine of the
forteen sanctioning bodies

357
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,992
I sincerely urge you all
to stay in school.

358
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,412
Uh, thank you.

359
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:56,043
Thank you, Drederick Tatum.
That was truly a K.O...

360
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,121
knockout oration. Heh.

361
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,667
Need a ride home?

362
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,090
You really don't want that. Trust me.

363
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,249
Mr. Tatum...

364
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:06,167
{\an8}do you mind if I swab you
with this damp rag?

365
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,626
No, not at all. Swab away.

366
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,257
Whoa, whoa.

367
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,894
Nobody mentioned a beaker.

368
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,641
{\an8}Please? It's for science.

369
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,142
Oh, for science. In that case, proceed.

370
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,225
Lisa, this is outrageous.
Explain yourself.

371
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,441
Shh, it's working. Look.

372
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,435
Nelson, what are you doing?

373
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,528
I don't know.

374
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,572
I can't help myself.

375
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,236
Hey, cut it out. I insist that you desist.

376
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:38,083
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

377
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,213
Yes.

378
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,049
Oh, please, don't hurt me.

379
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,670
You leave me little recourse.

380
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:52,046
ANNOUNCER: And now, the Estrogen
Network presents, <i>Afternoon Yak.</i>

381
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,806
(applause and whistles)

382
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:56,969
Men...

383
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,517
(booing)

384
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,520
Canceled.

385
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,811
The safe-baby craze.

386
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:05,645
It's sweeping Springfield,
thanks to one crusading parent.

387
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,903
That's me. Safety dance.

388
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,065
<i>♪ You can dance ♪</i>

389
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,243
<i>♪ You can dance ♪</i>

390
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,160
<i>♪ Everybody look at your pants ♪</i>

391
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,619
But while Homer Simpson
has made our babies safe

392
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,240
he's made our infant-related
businesses cry.

393
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,247
All the way away from the bank.

394
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,669
How are your baby crutch sales?

395
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,879
Uh, terrible, Kent.

396
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,588
And cartoon-character Band-Aids?

397
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,628
Forget about it.

398
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,881
Look at this baby.

399
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,672
Not a scratch on him.
And I got boat payments.

400
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,931
The dream is over.

401
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,140
-Shut her down, boys.
-(squeals)

402
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,232
Dear God, what have I done?

403
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,855
Babies of Springfield, we need your help.

404
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:46,899
Please.

405
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,152
Skin your knees.

406
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,993
Put dice up your nose.

407
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,449
Let cats sleep on your face.

408
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,446
{\an8}The problem?

409
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,953
Constant flying saucer attacks.

410
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,656
(buzzing sound)

411
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,156
{\an8}The solution?

412
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,537
{\an8}And thus, the earth is saved.

413
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,745
-MAN: That's a winner, Steve.
-WOMAN: Marvelous.

414
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:09,545
That's quite an act to follow, Lisa.

415
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,170
I know, and the crowd is so distinguished.

416
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,507
{\an8}The inventor of the
walkie-talkie is out there.

417
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,513
{\an8}Where?

418
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,054
{\an8}Third row, near the aisle.

419
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:20,427
(gasps) Ooh, your right.
And that's not his wife.

420
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,516
(indistinct voices)

421
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,230
Scientists... scientists, please.

422
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,560
Looking for some order...

423
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,305
some order, please...
with the eyes forward

424
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,266
and the hands neatly folded.

425
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,147
and the paying of attention.

426
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,494
Pi is exactly three.

427
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,818
(gasping)

428
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,529
Very sorry that it had to come to that.

429
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,284
But now that I have your attention

430
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,736
we have some exciting, new research

431
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,197
from young Lisa Simpson.

432
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,746
-Let's bring her out and pay attention.
-(scattered applause)

433
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,670
MAN: She's just a little girl...

434
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,128
... in the larval stage...

435
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,748
Let's not listen...

436
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,245
(clearing throat)

437
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,796
My study is entitled

438
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,879
"Airborne Pheromones
and Aggression in Bullies."

439
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,506
Bullies? Where?

440
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,892
For as long as there have been
smart people

441
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,810
there have been bullies to prey on them.

442
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,768
From Galileo...

443
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,976
To Sir Isaac Newton...

444
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,649
and even in the animal kingdom.

445
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,773
But why do the brawny prey on the brainy?

446
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,988
-Is it jealousy?
-Yes. Yes. Of course, yes.

447
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,698
No. The reason is chemical.

448
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:16,909
No, no. That's not possible.

449
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,069
That's impossible.
Chemicals are our friends.

450
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,198
She's a witch.

451
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,164
Please, Dr. Koop, let me demonstrate.

452
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,788
(wheels squeaking)

453
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,543
This is my test subject, Francine.

454
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,625
(growls)

455
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,920
(gasping)

456
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,802
I'd like to thank her parents
for helping with the caging.

457
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,966
Let me out of here!

458
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,681
{\an8}I have isolated the chemical
which is emitted

459
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,222
{\an8}by every geek, dork and four-eyes.

460
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,557
{\an8}I call it "Poindextrose."

461
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,772
Woo-hoo! Simpsons rule.

462
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,273
Sorry.

463
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,397
(growling) You're dead, nerd.

464
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,656
{\an8}The bully has caught my scent,
and she's at maximum rage.

465
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,782
Professor Frink?

466
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,447
(grunting)

467
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,445
Very well, Lisa, I'll just finagle the...

468
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,787
(audience gasping)

469
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,042
Are you mad, Frink?
Put down that science pole.

470
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,665
(door squeaks)

471
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,297
(screams)

472
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,131
Huh?

473
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,348
My God, she stopped in her tracks.

474
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,718
The little girl's invented
some sort of bully repellent.

475
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:25,966
-Yes, yes, you're right.
-Let's not listen.

476
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,518
Actually, it's just ordinary
salad dressing.

477
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,728
So that's where that went.

478
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,112
The pungent vinegar
and tangy Roquefort block

479
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,820
the smell receptors,
rendering the bully harmless.

480
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,571
-Oh, wonderful.
-Oh.

481
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,743
Wonderful.

482
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,360
Congratulations, Lisa.

483
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,197
You are truly the standout

484
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,582
of this year's Big Science Thing.

485
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,660
A gift certificate from J.C. Penney?

486
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,496
Yes, you'll love their slacks.

487
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,541
(laughs)

488
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,754
Oh, honey, we're so proud of you.

489
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:59,007
So, all her bullying was
just to get some attention?

490
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,261
No, Dad.

491
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,972
Didn't you listen to anything I said?

492
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,762
Just to get some attention.

493
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,096
FRINK: Lisa, help.

494
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,443
(Francine grunts)

495
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,270
The repellent's all gone.

496
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,725
Don't worry. She'll punch herself out.

497
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,816
Suck fist, Doctor Dork.

498
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,361
Someone's going to sleep well tonight.

499
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,905
(laughing)

500
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,573
(grunting)

501
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,908
-MARGE: What a cutie.
-Look at her pound that nerd.

502
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,655
(grunting)

503
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,165
(sniffing)

504
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,007
