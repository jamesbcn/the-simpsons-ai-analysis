We've gotta get to the hospital, Homer!

00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,545
OK. If the doctor asks
why you cut it off,

88
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,764
you caught me in bed
with four beautiful women.

I'm sorry, Homer. Your H.M.O.
doesn't cover this type of injury.

97
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,500
But I have finger insurance!

98
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,007
-A thumb is not a finger.
-Isn't there anything you can do?

99
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,340
Well, I could cut off the other thumb
for a sense of symmetry.

100
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,847
Symmetry, eh?

101
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:49,388
Hibbert's really losing it.
We're going to Dr. Nick's.

102
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,394
We need more ice.
My thumb is fading fast!

103
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,435
Quick!
Moe, Marge cut off my thumb!

104
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,692
No problem. Just stick
the old eye-gouger in the pickle brine.

105
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,316
That'll keep your thumb
fresh and delicious.

106
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,533
Thanks, Moe.

107
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,492
Hey, ah, hey, ain't you
going to have a beer?

108
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:10,701
Well, I really shouldn't, what with
my massive blood loss and all.

109
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,957
Although I do like
the occasional beer.

-A little coffee'll do the trick.

00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,390
(muttering) What?

117
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,515
Ooh! I gotta get to Dr. Nick's!

118
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,942
Where's Marge?
Oh, that is so rude.

119
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:43,284
Oh! I know. I'll hitchhike!

What a country!

Can you drive me to
Shelbyville Hospital?

00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,592
{\an8}-(sinister laughter)
-(electrical crackling)

172
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,845
Oh, no!

173
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,388
Somebody took my bike! (groans)

174
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,556
Mom, I need a ride to school!

175
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,942
MARGE:
We gotta get to the hospital, Homer!

176
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,560
(groans)

177
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,194
(music from <i>Run Lola Run</i>
playing)

178
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,494
(screams)

179
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,287
Idiot!
You almost ran over a viewer!

180
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,921
And she's in our key demo!
Sorry about that, kid. Need a ride?

181
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,380
-Can you take me to school, Krusty?
-Hop in.

182
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:34,335
Hey, moron.
Springfield Elementary, and step on it.

183
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:35,972
(chittering)

184
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,466
(siren wails)

185
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,675
Hey, Teeny, you know where
123 Fake Street is?

186
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,057
{\an8}(chittering)

187
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,983
Ah, it's OK.
Hey, we got the same hat.

188
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,897
-Thanks, Mr. Teeny.
-(chitters)

189
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,487
-Wha--
-(speaking French) <i>La grenouille</i>

190
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,575
<i>mange le pamplemousse.</i>

191
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:06,211
ALL: <i>La grenouille</i>
<i>mange le pamplemousse.</i>

192
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,000
(in English) Huh?
This isn't Miss Hoover's class.

193
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:13,665
I do not know this Mademoiselle "'oovair"
of which you speak.

194
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,046
What's happening? Where am I?

195
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,473
<i>Sacre bleu!</i>
What a foolish question!

196
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,523
You are at West Springfield
Elementary School.

197
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,388
West Springfield?

198
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,096
I'm at the wrong school!

199
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,937
-(all laughing)
<i>-En Français.</i>

200
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,154
(haughty laughter)

201
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,364
(gasps) Sorry.

202
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:39,025
I was rushing because
I'm in the wrong school.

203
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,825
(giggles) Can you believe that?

204
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,368
It's understandable.

205
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:45,251
All the schools in this area
were built from identical plans.

206
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,459
I guess they didn't have
enough money to hire I.M. Pei.

207
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,131
Oh. You know about I.M. Pei?

208
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,921
I.M. impressed.

209
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:57,304
(both laughing and snorting)

210
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,683
-My name's Thelonious.
-As in Monk?

211
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,890
Yes. The esoteric appeal
is worth the beatings.

212
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,232
-What do your friends call you?
-I don't really have any friends.

213
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,728
(gasps) Just like me!

214
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,693
("Happy Together" playing)

215
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,695
Oh, my God!

216
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:24,371
It's 11:15!
We've been spinning for hours.

217
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,502
I've got to get to my school
and hand in Linguo.

218
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,870
Oh, but I don't want
to leave you.

219
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,247
You must. You can't sacrifice
grades for romance.

220
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,165
-That's not the girl I fell for.
-Will I ever see you again?

221
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,965
Of course you will... at the magnet
high school. Now, go.

222
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,800
(music from <i>Run Lola Run</i>
playing)

223
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,805
(panting)

224
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,810
Hmm. It's noon.

225
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,102
That's about when Dad
gets the brew shakes.

226
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,443
My dad's not here?
I need a ride to school!

227
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,944
-Yeah, yeah. We all got problems.
-(whimpering)

228
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,987
Chief Wiggum, can you drive me to school?
It's an emergency!

229
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:05,162
Ah, no can do, doll face.
I got an informant wearing a wire.

230
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,752
(chuckles) Just like on Nash Bridges.

231
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,498
We're trying to get the goods
on some smugglers.

232
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,410
(frequency whirring)

233
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,958
FAT TONY: <i>Why, I'd be delighted</i>
<i>to sell you some illegally smuggled goods.</i>

234
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,713
-That sounds like Fat Tony.
-Only one way to be sure.

235
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,047
Fat Tony, is that you? Fat Tony?

236
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,932
FAT TONY: <i>Hey, where's that voice</i>
<i>coming from?</i>

237
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,759
-MAN 1: <i>This guy's wearing a wire!</i>
-MAN 2: Take him out!

238
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,885
(gunfire)

239
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,772
My bad. I can't work
my answering machine either.

240
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,270
(chuckles) Now I need a new informant.

241
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,363
Say, Lisa, people trust you.
How would you like to be a snitch?

242
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,109
-The pay stinks, but--
-(footsteps receding)

243
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,783
Oh.

244
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,453
Quick! Moe, Marge cut off my thumb!

245
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,449
(music from <i>Run Lola Run </i>playing)

246
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,034
-(horn honking)
-Lisa!

247
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,497
Mom, where'd you get that car?

248
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,748
I stole it from McBain after I cut off
your father's thumb.

249
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,752
Can you take me to school, please?

250
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,794
Not right now.
Your father's in there, and--

251
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,757
HOMER: Did you ever
see that <i>Blue Man Group?</i>

252
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,969
Oh, he's on the <i>Blue Man Group </i>again.

253
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,629
Come on. We've got lots of time.

254
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,345
-(engine sputters, stalls)
-Oh, no!

255
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:17,824
We're out of gas. I couldn't figure out
this stupid Italian gas gauge.

256
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,898
Oh, I've gotta get to school!

257
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,444
(country song playing on car stereo)

258
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,568
Hmm. Let's hitch a ride with that hick.

259
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,659
(both panting)

260
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,540
Abracathumbra!

261
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,421
(laughing)

262
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:38,168
Dang! You could be
one of them TV magic queers.

263
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,665
-(tires screeching)
-(clucking)

264
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,181
Shoo!

265
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,352
Mom, I have to get to school!
It's 10 to 3:00!

266
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,652
Well, I've already borrowed one car.
Let's go!

267
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,396
Somebody done stoleded my wheels.

268
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,235
Thanks a lot!
Now I gotta walk to Shelbyville.

269
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:08,993
There's the school!

270
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,869
First place, here I come.

271
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,326
(gasps) Look out!

272
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,625
Bart!

273
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,918
-(tires screeching)
-(gasps, screams)

274
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,478
Son of a diddly!

275
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,730
<i>Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Hey, hey!</i>

276
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,114
<i>Lazy, huh? Get him, boys!</i>

277
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,364
-(music playing)
<i>-Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!</i>

278
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,855
OK, OK!

279
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,622
MARGE: Breakfast!

280
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,662
-(doorbell rings)
-That's Milhouse.

281
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:59,496
-(ringing frantically)
-And it sounds like he has big news!

282
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:06,006
{\an8}-I found something awesome in the woods!
-Is it a dead body?

283
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,430
{\an8}-It's cooler than a million dead bodies!
-(snickers)

284
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,434
You take my sister's bike.

285
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,638
Let's see. Front door. Back door.

286
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,063
Skinner's. Flanders'. Your house.

287
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,392
Ah! Lisa's bike.

288
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,241
-What's it like riding a girl's bike?
-It's disturbingly comfortable.

289
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,659
Whoa! How'd you find it?

290
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:37,622
-This is where I come to cry.
-Cool.

291
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,165
Wow! Sacks!

292
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,712
Burlap sacks!

293
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,415
It gets better. They're full of fireworks!

294
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,296
Bottle rockets, Frog-Launchers,
Weeping Mommas...

295
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,385
Tijuana Toilet Crackers!

296
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,270
Three, two, one. Gnomes, blow up.

297
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,225
(both laughing hysterically)

298
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,320
(grunting loudly)

299
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,991
-(high-pitched screaming)
-We're not ready!

300
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,320
(sinister chuckle)

301
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,988
-(grunts)
-Uh-oh.

302
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:20,497
So what are we doing,
a lengthening or a widening?

303
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,381
Yargh, uh... let's make it both.

304
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,959
-Yargh!
-Don't worry. It's inflammable.

305
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,625
Let's keep this our little secret.

306
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,967
-(siren wailing)
-Oh, we gotta hide!

307
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,601
We'll be safe in here.

308
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,017
Here we are. 123 Fake Street.

309
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,276
The home of Knifey Wifey.

310
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,238
Hey, Chief, can I hold my gun sideways?
It looks so cool.

311
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,320
(chuckling) Ah, sure.

312
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,315
Whatever you want, birthday boy.

313
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,624
OK, drop the knife, Stabatha! I--

314
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:02,463
-(both grunt)
-Great grilled-cheese ghost!

315
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,039
We've uncovered a hard-core cracker house.

316
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,875
There's enough Chinese sky candy here...

317
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,590
to put you boys away for a long time.

318
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:13,631
{\an8}I can't go to juvie.
They use guys like me as currency!

319
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,047
{\an8}Yeah. They'll pass you around like--

320
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,512
{\an8}Well, like currency, like you said.

321
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,467
Maybe we can make you boys a deal.

322
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,807
Your mission is to find
the fireworks smugglers

323
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:29,066
and get them to say
something incriminating on this tape.

324
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,283
<i>Hootie and the Blowfish?</i>

325
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,450
Yeah. It's cheaper than blank tape.

326
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,029
Great idea to smuggle fireworks, boss.

327
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,406
Yeah, I was gettin' sick
of running those unions.

328
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,373
So much paperwork.

329
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,293
Knock-knock. Excuse me.

330
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:47,002
My friend and I were interested
in purchasing quality fireworks.

331
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,794
Yes, we are.

332
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:53,257
Why, I'd be delighted to sell you
some illegally smuggled goods.

333
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,470
{\an8}WIGGUM (on radio): <i>Fat Tony, is that you?</i>
<i>Fat Tony?</i>

334
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,762
{\an8}-Hey, where's that voice coming from?
-This guy's wearing a wire!

335
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,807
Take him out!

336
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,102
(grunting)

337
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,394
Whoa!

338
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,105
-WIGGUM: <i>My bad.</i>
-(grunts)

00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:15,988
MAN 1: Hey, there they are!

340
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,990
Gentlemen, remove your guns
from your holsters.

341
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,954
-Shoulder or ankle?
-Surprise me.

342
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,291
-(both whimpering)
-(groaning)

343
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,876
Milhouse, quick!

344
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,958
(gasps) Look out!

345
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,257
Bart!

346
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,550
-(tires screeching)
-(gasps, screams)

347
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,224
(clunks)

348
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,393
-Ow! Mom!
-MILHOUSE: Hurry up, Bart!

349
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,315
(tires screeching)

350
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,985
(both panting, gasping)

351
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,783
You ain't goin' nowhere!

352
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,037
You leave those boys alone!

353
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,002
-(grunts)
-(yelling)

354
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,294
Hey, they's throwin' robots!

355
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,166
<i>They are throwing robots.</i>

356
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,014
He's disrespecting us. Shut up-a you face!

357
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,510
<i>Shut up your face.</i>

358
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,393
-What's the matter you?
-You ain't so big.

359
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,511
Me and him are gonna
whack you in the labonza!

360
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:28,728
<i>Um-uh... mm... Bad grammar overload!</i>

361
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,310
{\an8}<i>Error! Error!</i>

362
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,943
-(explosion)
-What the hell!

363
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,320
(gasps) Linguo... dead?

364
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,405
(both shuddering)

365
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,584
It's all right, boys.

366
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,753
Oh, thank goodness everyone's OK.

367
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,881
Except your thumb,
and Lisa's science project.

368
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,000
{\an8}I couldn't help but notice
your respective predicaments.

369
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,588
{\an8}Perhaps I may offer a bipartite solution.

370
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,603
There you go. Enjoy your thumb.

371
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,432
LISA: As the circulation returns,

372
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:12,347
the subject prepares
for a long and painful recovery.

373
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,529
{\an8}It's lucky for me that Legs
was an experienced Mob doctor.

374
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:22,359
He once pulled a slug out of my arm
and inserted it into a stoolie's brain.

375
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,527
That's a first place
science project, Lisa.

376
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,076
(all cheering)

377
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:31,621
Boy, this sure was one crazy day.

378
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,044
-Right, Mr. Teeny?
-(chuckling)

379
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,257
(all laughing)

380
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,088
{\an8}(chittering loudly)

381
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,511
(theme music playing)

382
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,143
-(laughter)
