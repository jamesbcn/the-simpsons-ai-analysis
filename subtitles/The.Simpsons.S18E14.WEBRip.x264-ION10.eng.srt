49
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:12,841
Years ago, Stanley DeGroot
was a cook here at the school.

<i>All the kids made fun of him</i>

51
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,347
<i>because he never graduated</i>

(singsongy):
Stanley, Stanley,
no degree.

53
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,635

What happened to Dark Stanley?

64
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,596
{\an8}They hanged him for murder

65
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,436
{\an8}and buried him in
an unmarked grave.

66
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,901
{\an8}When they came back
the next day,

67
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,111
{\an8}the whole cemetery was missing!

00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,232

70
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,862
{\an8}Try not to
think about it.

71
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:21,577
{\an8}They say Dark Stanley makes
your skull into a toilet

72
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,409
{\an8}and wee-wees into it.

73
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,164
{\an8}And just when you think
he’s done,

74
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,746
{\an8}Dark Stanley takes your skin
and makes footy pajamas.

75
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,093
{\an8}Nobody pajamanates my skin.

76
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,089
{\an8}This is the very spot

77
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,011
{\an8}where Dark Stanley comes
to harvest heads

78
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,759
{\an8}for his soup of sorrow.

79
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,511
{\an8}Why aren’t you a-scareded?

80
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,553
{\an8}Oh, Dark Stanley
would never dare attack

appreciate you letting me

store my collection of antique
cologne bottles in your office

92
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,465
while they recarpet
my condo.

93
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:25,353
It’s quite a collection
and, I assume, irreplaceable.

94
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,561
You assume correctly.

Well, you are going
to get some counseling

from our school
psychologist.

Dark Stanley’s going
to eat my brains!

102

Or from a <i>qualified</i>
professional.

103
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,213
But first... Willie,
get those kids back!

104
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,673
I’ll bring those wee ones back
dead or alive.

105
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,922
Not dead.

106
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,224

00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,874

110
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,490
All right,
you heard him.

111
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,788
Back to class.

112
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,001
But we don’t go
to school.

113
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,421
But you do live
in the district.

114
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,419
That’s right.

115
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,920
We home-school ’em.

116
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,802
I teach the big ones

117
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,509
and the big ones teach
the little ones.

118
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,169
but no one ever taught me,

119
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,467
which makes the whole thing
just an exercise in futility.

120
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,762
Uh-huh.

121
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,255
Skinner, what is
going on here?

122
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,057
Sir, if we let these hill folk
into our school,

123
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,601
our test scores
would drop so low,

124
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,604
we’d lose
all federal funding.

125
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,555
I see...

126
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,065
and we’ve already lost state,
county, and local funding.

127
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,278
Plus our last bake sale
was a disaster.

128
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,319

129
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,152

00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,198
My name’s Lisa.
What are your names?

175
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,199
Witney!

176
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,240
Jitney!

177
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,243
Dubya!

178
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,244
Incest!

179
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,365
Crystal Meth!

180
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,701
International Harvester!

181
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,575
Birthday!

182
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:20,422
(whining):
Are we gonna do
this much work every day?

183
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,795
Why do I have to go
to a stupid psychiatrist?

184
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,049
I told a scary story.
Big deal.

185
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,181
Look, boy, nobody
knows better than me

186
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,718
that you’re a lost cause.

187
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,051
But the school’s paying
for five sessions

188
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,927
and there’s a Chinese
restaurant next door

189
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,934
where I can get drunk.

190
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,476
Get ready, Sheila.
This guy likes the act.

191
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,981
(heavy Chinese accent):
Mr. Simpson! You good man!

192
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,404
-We happy see you!
-You not come long time!

193
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,153
Come sit, drinky-drinky.

194
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,775
Where’s Margie?
She super lady!

195
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:50,782
(laughs)

196
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,123
Bart, my name
is Dr. Swanson.

197
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,449
Stop right there, Doc.

198
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,454
This school has sent me
to more therapists

199
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,746
than you’ve had bad dates.

200
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,158
I’ve looked at the ink blots.

201
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,667
I’ve played with the puppets.

202
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,538
The whole racket’s
a hatful of crap.

203
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,415
I see.

204
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,132
Well... I get paid whether
you make progress or not.

205
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,593
Why don’t we just kill the time
playing videogames?

206
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,134
Yeah, right. I bet you’ve got
a bunch of "learning" games.

207
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,508
Why don’t you go online
and look for a boyfriend

208
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,144
while I take a nap?

209
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,521
Actually, I just got
"Death Kill City II:

210
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,638
Death Kill Stories."

211
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,345
Whoa! You’ve got "DKC2: DKS"?

212
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,936
That one’s rated
"Bad for Everyone."

213
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:29,153
(yelling and grunting)

214
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,775
<i>VIDEOGAME NARRATOR:</i>
<i>You have destroyed</i>
<i>all human life on earth.</i>

215
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,116
<i>Level 1 complete.</i>

216
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,201
(laughing):
Yes!

217
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,997
And that’s how a presidential
veto gets overridden.

218
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,463
Any questions?

219
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:49,013
How is any of this gonna
put dog meat on my plate?

220
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,338
Hmm. Maybe the best way
to begin your education

221
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,675
is to get you some exposure
to the wider world.

222
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,510
So, I’m gonna take you
to downtown Springfield!

223
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,218
We gotta get permission
from Daddy.

224
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,478
It’s all right with me.

225
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,190
DR. SWANSON:
<i>And, lastly...</i>

226
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,110
-I need a noun.
-Booger.

227
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,147
Read it back!
Read it back!

228
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,323
"The county fair is
always <i>sucky </i>to visit

229
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,323
on a hot summer <i>fart."</i>

230
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,325
"You can eat
delicious cotton <i>hate,</i>

231
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,618
and ride the Ferris <i>burp</i>

232
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,621
and the Merry-go- <i>booger."</i>

233
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,123
(laughing)

234
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,754
You can’t make
that stuff up.

235
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,041
What does this tell you, Bart?

236
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,634
That this is one terrible
county fair.

237
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,630
And...?

238
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,091
And...

239
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,551
My dad never takes me
on the merry-go-booger.

240
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,933
He’s always passed out
in the parking snot.

241
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,760
HOMER:
He’s lying!

242
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,925
You drink too many
scorpion bowl.

243
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,684
You go sleepy-sleepy now!

244
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,766

245
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,055
(no accent):
Did, uh,
did you get his wallet?

246
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,515
Every president
has a word balloon

247
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,565
that says "I am gay."

248
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,821
(chainsaw revs)

249
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,704
These colorful bums is funny!

250
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,571

You kids got talent!
And I should know.
I used to have it.

272
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,274
Hey! You’re one of those
funny people

273
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,943
with a big crazy nose.

274
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,571
-A clown?
-No, a...

275
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,818
Joker! That’s right!

276
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,200
And I’m not a practicing joker,
so I’m not that offended.

277
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,569
Well it’s nice to
see you again, Krusty,

278
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,366
but these kids have
field trip journals to write.

279
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,201
Yeah, yeah, right.
Who’s your agent?

280
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,576
What’s an agent?

281
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,372
Ka-ching!

282
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,416
(laughs)

283
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,499
Finally, I get a chance
to use these gag contact lenses.

284
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,296
And then I had this dream

285
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,669
that my whole family
was just cartoon characters,

286
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,337
and that our success had led

287
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,255
to some crazy propaganda
network called "Fox News."

288
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,604
Bart, I think you’re making
a lot of progress,

289
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,560
but our time is up.

290
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,810
See ya next Wednesday.

291
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,562
Actually,
this was our last session.

292
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,853
Huh?

293
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,266
But we were doing
such good work.

294
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,355
Oh, Bart, I truly
enjoyed our time together,

295
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,742
but the school only
paid for five sessions.

296
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,743
I think I just got dumped.

297
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,117
He used to rob me
two, three times a week.

298
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,705
Now, I’m lucky
if I get it once a month.

299
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,501
He never initiates it.
I have to do all the work.

300
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,245
He just stands there.

301
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,797
Now, now, don’t talk
through him; talk <i>to </i>him.

302
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,012
Apu, sometimes
when I rob you,

303
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,052
it’s like
you’re not even there.

304
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,926
That is because
you’re robbing
my brother Sanjay.

305
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,313
Dude, I didn’t know.

306
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,139
Oh, just shut up!

307
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,564
KRUSTY:
That’s right.

308
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,352
I want to hire your entire
Appalachian dumpling gang,

309
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,106
and I’ll pay them
the most anyone on TV

310
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,729
is entitled to get: scale!

311
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,647
Now I don’t sign
nothin’ without

312
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,605
pretendin’ to read it first.

313
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,565
Hamburger, hamburger,

314
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,486
hamburger, hamburger.

315
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,494
Looks good!

316
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,285
Mr. Spuckler, wait!

317
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,039
Is this really good
for your kids?

318
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,120
Teeny, get her out of here!

319
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,496
Whoa!

320
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,963
Okay kids, let’s cut

aren’t dumb.

345

00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,903
Kids, it’s finally happening.

350
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,690
Your own prime-time special.

351
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,154
The songs will be written

352
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,403
by Broadway’s greatest composer:
this guy.

353
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,277
What’s your name
again, fuzz-face?

354
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,453
Stephen Sondheim.

355
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,741
I know you hear this
all the time,
but I think you’re great.

356
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,405
And I’m sure you
hear this all the time:

357
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,785
you cost an arm and a leg,
so let’s get to work.

358
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:57,962
Here’s the opening number.

359
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,213
Hmm, complex harmonies,

360
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,844
intricate lyrics,

361
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,171
pithy observations
on modern life.

362
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,466
What is this junk?!

363
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,969
Where’s the zazz?

364
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,431
Just do what you did in <i>Cats!</i>

365
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,601
I didn’t write <i>Cats.</i>

366
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,009
You didn’t?!

367
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,887
Oh, no!

368
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,604
All right, I’ll try
and save this.

369
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,845
Tell you what.

370
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,266
Just give me
a peppy vamp.

371
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,194
Okay. And I can
counterpoint it with...

372
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,322
No counterpoint!

373
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,859
Vamp! Peppy!

374
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,442
(peppy vamp plays)

375
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,703
Hey! This peppy
stuff isn’t bad.

376
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,412
Maybe I will right that
jingle for Buzz Cola.

377
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,492

378
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,497
♪ President or ayatollah ♪

379
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,579

380
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,075

382
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,835
Krusty, the Spuckler kids

383
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,050
missed their
reading class today.

384
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,221
Yeah? Well, take it up
with their manager.

385
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,639
(gulps)
Yeah.

386
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,679
Cletus, I think
you’re spending too much

387
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,262
of the kids’
earnings on yourself.

388
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,137
That’s a lie!
I ain’t spent

389
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,694
their money on naught
but necessities.

390
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,808
Sir, your solid gold
hound dog is here.

391
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,605
(reverse signal beeps)

392
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,900
Uh... How do we get
the real dog out?

393
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,114
(muffled howling bark)

394
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,744
Do you think I’m telling
people not to have a cow

395
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,622
because deep down
I <i>want </i>them to have a cow?

396
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,537
I saw you yesterday
in the dining room,

397
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,171
and I didn’t know
if I should say "hi" or not.

398
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,539
(sighing)

399
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,955
(concerned groan)

400
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,884
(door buzzer buzzing)

401
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,547
How can I help you?

402
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,931
Dr. Swanson,
I’m Bart’s mother.

403
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,429
I’ve been saving this money

404
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,850
for my husband’s
breast reduction surgery,

405
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,679
but I think
this is more important.

406
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,725
Would you please
see Bart again?

407
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,101
Of course. Send him in.

408
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,902
Bart, honey,

409
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,742
this is all
we can afford for now.

410
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,198
If it doesn’t work,
maybe when you’re an adult,

411
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,449
you can pay some lady
to make you happy for an hour.

412
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,532
You know,
I’m pretty sure I will.

413
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,210
And I wasn’t planned,
so when I came,

414
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,749
my parents <i>had</i>
to get married.

415
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,092
And they were too young,
and not ready for a kid

416
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,458
to screw up their lives.

417
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,384
Maybe I act out because...

418
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,634
if my parents are mad at me,

419
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,466
they can’t fight
with each other.

420
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,051
(relieved sigh)

421
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,136
And maybe
<i>that’s </i>why you do things

422
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,642
like scare your classmates
with Dark Stanley?

423
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:24,524
Yeah. That, and Stanley
was the brand of hammer

424
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,983
my dad used to hit me with.

425
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,443
Very good.

426
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,443
Bart, we have
20 minutes left.

427
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,355
Is there anything else
you want to talk about?

428
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,113
You know what?

429
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,485
I think I’m good.

430
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,699
Oh. Oh, good. Good.

431
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,244
Good, w-we...
Will I see you again?

432
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,247
Anything could happen.

433
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,959
One of these days I might have
a complete psychotic breakdown.

434
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,920
Aw... I’d like that.

435
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,921
I just can’t stop
thinking about him.

436
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,343
Do you think maybe
Bart is replacing your son

437
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,512
who was killed by Dark Stanley?

438
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,141
Oh. Oh-oh-.

439
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,888
I am not ready
to go there.

440
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,894
(markers squeaking)

441
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,824
You kids finish
signing those 8x10s?

442
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,571
I’ve told five different
dry cleaners

443
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,953
they’s the best.

444
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,819

445
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,196
Uh, yeah, maybe.

446
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,033
But I’ve got some great news!

447
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,158

448
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,785

464
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,829

Sold it for smokes.

468
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,375
Cletus, I had to stop you
exploiting the children.

469
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,879
So I sent her an e-mail.

470
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,590
My babies ain’t
going on no bus tour.

471

It doesn’t matter what you say.

472
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,681
I got a contract signed
by the father of these children.

473
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,510
He’s only the father
of two of ’em!
