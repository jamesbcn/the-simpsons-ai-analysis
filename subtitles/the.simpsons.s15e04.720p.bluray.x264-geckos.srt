Oh, Marge,
l am so sorry.

342
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,960
l should've listened
to whatever it was
you were saying.

343
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:29,172
lt's partly my fault.
l've been nagging you
so much on this trip,

344
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:32,050
you couldn't know
which nags to focus on.

345

Well, Marge, if l die here,
there's one thing l
want you to remember.

346
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,640
Don't buy any
videotapes in England !

347
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,727

Dear God of England,
please let me go.

350

l will spell the word
"color" with a "U."

Huh? Oh !

354
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,747
We found a secret tunnel
out of the Tower!

355
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,166
lt was used by
Sir Walter Raleigh !

356

A secret tunnel?
l don't know.

Won't that get me
in more trouble?

Homer, you couldn't
be in more trouble.

359
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:12,966
They're going to put
your head on a pike.

360

They're practicing
with melons.

361

Smash it on ! Don't worry it.
Let the pike do the work.

Okay, what do l do?

363
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,478
Push the gray brick
in the back of the

Oh, my God.
We've made
a terrible mistake.

This tunnel comes out
in the worst possible place!

An elephant's butt?

Yes, Bart.
An elephant's butt.

374
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,053
Boy, a Krispy Kreme would
really clean up down here.

l know we don't call
as often as we should

388

well-behaved as our goody

in your jewel-encrusted

Sorry l never
saw you again.

the cultural differences
between us were too great.

pulled away from the dock,
