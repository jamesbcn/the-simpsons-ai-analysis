00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,230
(sighs) Ooh.

360
00:15:15,363 --> 00:15:16,203
Oh.

361
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:17,998
My friend, if you know something

362
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:19,472
and withhold from us,

363
00:15:19,471 --> 00:15:21,941
it will not go well.

364
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:23,283
Mmm. (whimpers)

365
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,549
What he means is...
(imitates cutting) Oh, crap,

366
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:28,263
my fingernails are too sharp!

367
00:15:29,124 --> 00:15:30,594
Aah! I can't see!

368
00:15:30,594 --> 00:15:32,064
(gangsters whimpering)

369
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,125
Oh, you did good, Homer.

370
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:37,374
You didn't stop them,
but you made them very mad.

371
00:15:43,018 --> 00:15:45,458
We got him now
as long as he don't look back.

372
00:15:45,456 --> 00:15:48,426
With that fat neck?
Fuhgeddaboudit.

374
00:16:09,337 --> 00:16:11,937
Oh, how many dinners
can this guy have?

375
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:14,113
He eats more than
Frankie Eats Too Much.

376
00:16:14,114 --> 00:16:16,454
Our nicknames...
they're so judgmental.

377

378

Oh. Oh, God. Oh God.
Where's Ned?

379
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:37,634
I don't know.
I came back

380
00:16:37,628 --> 00:16:40,098
to bring him fresh towels
and he disappeared.

381
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,199
He wouldn't just leave
without drying himself off.

382
00:16:42,203 --> 00:16:44,373
- He wouldn't!
- (gun chambers rack)

383
00:16:44,374 --> 00:16:45,944
No Flanders!

384
00:16:45,944 --> 00:16:48,654
And who knew fatso
had such a hot wife.

385
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,150
Eh, it's a sitcom thing.

386
00:16:50,152 --> 00:16:52,492
King of Queens,
Fred Flintstone,

387
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,860
Timmy and Lassie.

388
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,300
Such a beautiful dog.

389
00:16:55,296 --> 00:16:59,096
Where the hell
would Flanders go?

390
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,295
Well, this would be
a good time for a prayer.

391
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:17,343
Let's see.

392
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,850
May I suggest a prayer
from the Klingon Language Bible?

393
00:17:20,847 --> 00:17:24,347
(speaks Klingon)

394
00:17:24,354 --> 00:17:26,994
(sighs)
Even I think this is idiotic.

395
00:17:26,993 --> 00:17:28,703
Eh, good luck.

396
00:17:35,877 --> 00:17:37,107
Why are you here?

397
00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:41,123
Because, deep down, I believe
you are a good man, Fat Tony.

398
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:43,231
The... Well, that's not
your Christian name.

399
00:17:43,225 --> 00:17:45,495
Let me call you... Anthony.

400
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:47,066
Anthony.

401
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,266
Mama used to call me that.

402
00:17:49,271 --> 00:17:51,211
Mm-hmm. And a man
who loves his mother

403
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,648
as much as you do
can't be all bad.

404
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,386
Mommy.

405
00:17:56,385 --> 00:17:59,315
And someone who bought
that much band candy

406
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:01,834
must have a very soft heart.

407
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:03,669
Maybe I like candy.

408
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,037
You are right.

409
00:18:05,036 --> 00:18:08,206
I'm hard on the outside
and soft on the inside.

410
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:11,378
Like the world's
most murderous cannoli.

411
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:14,561
Knew it. Repeat after me:

412
00:18:14,555 --> 00:18:16,885
I believe in God.

413
00:18:16,893 --> 00:18:20,133
The creator almighty.

414
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,672
Maker of Heaven and Earth.

415
00:18:22,671 --> 00:18:24,311
Maker of Heaven
and Earth!

416
00:18:24,307 --> 00:18:26,407
And so on and so forth!

417
00:18:26,411 --> 00:18:28,351
(sobs)

418
00:18:29,184 --> 00:18:32,864
Now, take my hand
in loving friendship.

419
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:36,329
Okay, kill him.

420
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:38,171
- What?
- I'm sorry, Ned.

421
00:18:38,168 --> 00:18:40,468
But this is the business
we've chosen.

422
00:18:40,473 --> 00:18:42,543
Although you were
tricked into it.

423
00:18:42,544 --> 00:18:43,814
That's on me.

424
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:46,223
Any last requests?

425
00:18:46,218 --> 00:18:47,918
Eh, just one.

426
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:49,261
Can I remove my mustache?

427
00:18:49,257 --> 00:18:52,197
I... I want to be clean-shaven
for the Lord.

428
00:18:55,704 --> 00:18:57,374
He's wearin' a wire!
Aah!

429
00:18:57,373 --> 00:18:59,783
I told you
to pat down his schnozz!

430
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:01,449

- (tires screech)

431

432
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:07,534
(music stops)

433
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:11,338
This whole time,
you've been working for the G.

434
00:19:11,335 --> 00:19:12,965
Not the whole time.

435
00:19:12,971 --> 00:19:14,341
<i>But once a certain young lady</i>

436
00:19:14,341 --> 00:19:16,481
<i>pulled the wool from my eyes...</i>

437
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,887
- I'd like to be a snitch.
- Okay.

438
00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:21,785
But if things go south
and we have to pull you out,

439
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:24,599
you're gonna wind up
Mr. John Smith in Utah.

440
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:27,025
Oh, that's a dream
I've always had.

441
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,303
- (handcuffs click)
- I loved you, man.

442
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:31,584
You didn't even
remember my birthday.

443
00:19:31,576 --> 00:19:32,876
I sent you a card.

444
00:19:32,878 --> 00:19:35,178
Belatedly.

445
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:41,332
- Flanders.
- Simpson.

446
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:43,168
I'm proud of you, man.

447
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:44,895
I can't believe
someone in this town

448
00:19:44,902 --> 00:19:46,812
finally put that guy in jail.

449
00:19:46,806 --> 00:19:48,476
- Yeah.
- What's wrong?

450
00:19:48,475 --> 00:19:50,475
Well, I miss 'em a little.

451
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:52,719
That guy can really kiss.

452
00:19:52,718 --> 00:19:56,258
Stupid Flanders,
you're a brave man.

453
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:58,328
(short chuckle)
I'm nothing special.

454
00:19:58,328 --> 00:20:00,768
I take my shower in the dark
just like anybody else.
