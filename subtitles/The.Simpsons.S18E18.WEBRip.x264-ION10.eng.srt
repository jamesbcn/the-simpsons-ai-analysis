{\an8}Homer,
what took you so long?

{\an8}The game’s almost over.

12
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,671
{\an8}I got hung up
at the snack stand

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,840
{\an8}watching those hot dogs
rolling and turning,

14
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:48,009

Strike two!

19
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:07,277
{\an8}By my calculations, we’re only
one strike away from victory.

20
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,568
Numbers are fun.

for Groundskeeper Willie,

24
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,584
{\an8}who made me this beautiful
black bicep warmer!

25
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,539

{\an8}I’m also pleased!

37

{\an8}After years of failure
in everything we’ve attempted,

38
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,107
{\an8}we are one victory away

{\an8}Flanders, these boys
have earned the right

48
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,211
{\an8}to behave like
arrogant oafs.

00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,836

Upsy-daisy, sir.

56
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,979
Ah, what glorious goo!

57
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:31,026
{\an8}I need a dress to wear
for my son’s big game.

58
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,739
{\an8}He’s the star, I’m his mom,
and he’s my son.

59
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,530
{\an8}Mm-hmm, you’ve
mentioned his name

60
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,283
{\an8}and batting average
several times.

61
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,655
{\an8}Well, he’s done very well
for someone

62
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,741
{\an8}who came out blue
and backwards.

63
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,247
{\an8}Listen, do you mind
if I hum while you talk?

64
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,829
{\an8}Not at all!

-He single-handedly
got the team

66
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,593
{\an8}-to the championship,
first time ever.
-(humming)

67
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,788
{\an8}My son caught the ball

68
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:50,838
-that won the game.
-(continues humming)

{\an8}(sighs)

70
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,340
{\an8}I hate shopping!

71
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:58,764
{\an8}I’m bored; my feet hurt; I’m
too big for the choo-choo train.

72
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,715
Hmm...

73
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:03,684
where’s the "husband chair?"

74
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,016
Unless you’re serving me
a cold beer,

75
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,232
you keep moving.

76
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,312
(moaning):
Oh!

77
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,056
There must be another chair.

78
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,230
-(cocks gun)
-Eh-eh.

79
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,028
My wife’s lookin’
for a bathing suit

80
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,741
that doesn’t make
her look "horsey."

81
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,741
So, I’m gonna
be here a while.

82
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:20,664
Mm-hmm.

83
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,576
(moaning)

84
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:27,041
I guess I could just sit
on a bed.

85
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,963
Wow, this is soft.

86
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,634
Sure feels weird lying on top
of the covers.

87
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,679
Sure feels weird lying in bed
with my pants on.

88
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,680

00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,021
What in the name of...?

91
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,020
Hey, you!

92
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,441
Whoa! How many?

93
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,809
Are you sleeping in the middle
of my department store?

94
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,067
Well...

95
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,778
who wouldn’t

96
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,938
with an incredible mattress
like this?

97
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,197
It works with my body’s
natural curves

98
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,159
and supports
my back-boobs.

99
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,330
That’s the best
endorsement I’ve heard

100
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,538
since Mickey Mantle
for Maypo!

101
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,749
I’ll take
five mattresses.

102
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,369
I don’t work here.

103
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,166
You do now, son!

104
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,710
(jowly):
You’re hired!

105
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,336
Woo-hoo!

106
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,630
(cheering)

107
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,926
All this fuss
for a baseball game?

108
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,260
Why don’t thousands come to
watch a teacher inspire a child?

109
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,717
But it did happen.

110
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,727
Just yesterday,
in Crazytown!

111
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:34,363
<i>BASEBALL ANNOUNCER:</i>

And kill my sister.

120
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,928
A lazy pop fly
to star shortstop Bart Simpson.

121
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,182
And this should do it!

122
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,354
Now for the defining moment
of my life.

123
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,030

126
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,118
Simpson drops the ball!

127
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,627
And he kicks it!

128
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,460
And he kicks it again!
And again!

129
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,505
Oh, it’s horrible, but you can’t
take your eyes away!

130
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:45,010
It’s like watching a monkey

Bart, you choked!

136
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,118
I put on fresh
makeup for this?

137
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,623
(booing)

138
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,536
Knock it off!

139
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,213
He’s just a kid!

140
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,091
Aw, hey that’s the guy
what created him!

141
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,838
If Homer had used
some protection,

142
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,130
we’d all be poopin’
roses on easy street!

143
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,884
Hey, get off my case!

144
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,335
He’s the choke artist!

145
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,335

146
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,182

(sighs)

148
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,483
Thanks, Chief.

149
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,900
Don’t mention it, son.

150
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,318
He’s back!

151
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,861
Go nuts, everyone!

152
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,698
(crowd booing)

153
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,416
Bart’s coming down!

154
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,618
Hide the sports section!

155
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,342
D’oh!

156
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,341
Good morning, sweetie.

157
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,847
There’s nothing you can say.

158
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,388
After that game,
my life is over.

159
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,471
Was there even a
baseball game yesterday?

160
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,177
I don’t remember...

161
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:18,267
Marge, we were just talking
about it a few seconds ago.

162
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,574
Don’t you have to get to your
job as a mattress salesman?

163
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,939
Oh, yeah. Let’s see
where that goes.

164
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,526
Let me tell you
about a land

165
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,951
where it rains beer
and hails pretzels

166
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,831
and you can play swim-up
blackjack with Abraham Lincoln.

167
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,449
It’s the land of sleep.

168
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,537
And your passport:

169
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,871
a simple mattress.

170
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,247
Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.

171
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,594
Yes, I need to be able to sleep
through my wife’s nagging

172
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,210
and my eight
horrible babies

173
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,087
and the anguished howls
of my ancestors.

174
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,215
A common problem.

175
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,341
Try this.

176
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,260
Oh. Ooh.

177
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,386
Oh, I feel like I’m floating
on a river of corpses.

178
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,385
(clearing throat)

179
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,636
Homer,
we have a friend--

180
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,808
actually a friend
of a friend...

181
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:01,807
Sex problem, eh?!

182
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:02,818
Homer, please.

183
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,279
They can hear you
in Fine China.

184
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:08,449
Relax. I’m a licensed
mattress professional,

185
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,779
if there were
such a thing,

186
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,695
and I’ve got the answer
to your problems:

187
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,664
The Snugulux by Matrimonium.

188
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,789
Ooh, sold.

189
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:25,045
And remember: your
most intimate secrets
are safe with me.

190
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,219
(louder):
Okay, who else
is dead in bed?

191
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,928
BILL:
<i>You’re listening to KBBL,</i>

192
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,758
your official
"Bart Simpson sucks" station.

193
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,514
Oh-ho, and here comes
another "Bash Bart Block,"

194
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,267
starting with this
entry from Jimbo,
Dolph, and Kearney.

Oh, my favorite

Bart, come with me.

203
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,164
I’ll take you to someone
who will make you feel better.

204
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,867
Is it my rabbit
Cottontail?

205
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,247
The one who went
to live upstate?

206
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,963
He died, Bart.

207
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,883
Dad buried him
in the backyard.

208
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,712
But not in that order.

209
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,007
(gasps)

210
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,270
Bart,
meet Joe LaBoot.

211
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,478
LaBoot, LaBoot.

212
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,389
Sounds familiar.

213
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:26,017
You probably remember me
from 1943 World Series.

214
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,147
With the score
tied in game seven,

215
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,074
Tommy Heinrich of the
Yankees hit a ball

216
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,492
in my direction.

217
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,361
Jugglin’ Joe LaBoot
they called me.

218
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,987
When I finally
picked up the ball,

219
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,954
I threw it into the stands,
hitting Eleanor Roosevelt,

220
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,955
who up till then
had been a great beauty.

221
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,288
We lost the game
and the series.

222
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,214
(chuckles):
But I bounced back.

223
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,963
Got my own car
dealership.

224
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,554
I have 17 grandchildren
and a big home in Idaho.

225
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,171
It’s a great life!

226
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,628
Yeah, in Idaho.

227
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,138
And at these card shows,
the fans let me know

228
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,970
that I’ve put my gaffe
behind me.

229
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,885
You stink, LaBoot!

230
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,564
No, I don’t!
Google my stats!

231
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,693
Take it from me, kid,
you’ll be just fine.

232
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,061
Feel better now,
Bart?

233
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,778
"Bart?!"
Are you Bart Simpson?

234
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,279
The kid who dropped
that easy fly ball?!

235
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,611
You stink like
a Dutchman’s throw-up.

236
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,027
Talking to you was the
biggest error of my life!

237
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,486
(crowd booing)

238
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,827
Boo. Boo, indeed.

239
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,377
The Lovejoys?!

240
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,383
If this is about me
drinking that holy water,
let me tell you,

241
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,006
I had had like
a million Doritos.

242
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,803
You know, the ones
with the flame on the bag?

243
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,217
Oh-ho, that bag
ain’t lyin’!

244
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,845
We’re here about
the mattress.

245
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,931
What’s wrong with it?

246
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,727
We tried raising Cain,
but we weren’t able.

247
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,231
Oh, I think I know
what you’re doing wrong.

248
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,614

250
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,856
I know the mechanics
of lovemaking, Homer!

251
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,525
You owe us a refund!

252
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,284

small businesses.

00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,314
I guess I could, uh,
if you pretend

355
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:37,061
to be my fiancée
when my mother comes to visit.

356
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,854
Okay. If you pretend
to be our chauffeur

357
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,228
at my high
school reunion.

358
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,694
Fine, fine, if you pretend
to be a ghost

359
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,935
at an old amusement park
I’m trying to buy.

360
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,527
-We should
stop now.
-Yeah.

361
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,372
You want me to reannounce
a game I’ve already called?

362
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,238
Oh, sister, I got
too much integrity.

363
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:56,366
The same integrity Farmer Dan
puts into every link sausage.

364
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,495
Then I guess
you wouldn’t mind eating one.

365
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,172
(sloshing)

366
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,540
Of course I wouldn’t.

367
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,297
It’s not like they’re made

368
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,209
of skunk tails
and horse nipples.

369
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,217
(sighs)

370
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,378
I’ll do whatever you say!

371
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,126
Just get that death wiener
away from me!

372
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,354
I’m starting to feel funny
about doing this.

373
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,314
Look, we’re just going
to take our mattress,

374
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,305
do a quick sweep of
the medicine chest,

375
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,607
then we’re
out of here.

376
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,990
(Homer hissing
like drummer’s high hat)

377
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,409
Homer, stop that.

378
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,238
Sorry.

379
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,373
There it is--
Old Bounce an’ Giggle.

380
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,741
(chuckles)

381
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,749
(engine revving,
tires squeal)

382
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,546
You put on
the Michael Bolton CD.

383
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,169
I’ll put on
my edible vestments.

384
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,216
(footsteps running)

385
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,219
HELEN LOVEJOY (gasps):
Oh, my God!

386
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,681
How dare you break
into our house,

387
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,221
defile our bed,

388
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,934
and smash our family photos
with your foot.

389
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,015
Well, excuse me

390
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,390
for being a powerful
yet careless lover.

391
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:04,017
Reverend Lovejoy, our
marriage needs this bed.

392
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,766
Our marriage
needs it more!

393
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,108
Well,
I am reminded

394
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,703
of the story
of wise King Solomon.

395
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,990
(scoffs)
You would be.

396
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,987
(dings)

397
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,707
I wish he hadn’t
cut it that way.

398
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,868
It looks like a
grilled-cheese sandwich.

399
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,627
Or a chicken club.

400
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,669
Or a-a Reuben.

401
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,963
Or a Monte Cristo, or...

402
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,918
Pull over behind
that billboard!

403
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,388
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

404
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,969
(moaning)

405
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,314
-Oh!
-Oh, yeah!

406
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,018
Oh! You really want
to make love

407
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,928
on half a mattress
behind a billboard?

408
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,518
It’s like our honeymoon
all over again.

409
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,274
Oh!

410
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:48,355
We even have the same bum
looking at us.

411
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,992
I knew you kids would make it.

412
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,159
Man, you
got fat.

413
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,778
<i>MALE ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i>So, it’s déjà vu all over again</i>

414
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,997
as Springfield needs
just one out to win the game

415
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,039
<i>and the championship.</i>

416
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,422

417
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,709
<i>Probably everyone</i>
<i>who was here the last time.</i>

418
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,213
I still can’t
believe it.

419
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,884
They dusted the plate
with a non-regulation brush,

420
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,053
so we have to play
the last inning over again.

421
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,262
I think this time
it’ll have a happier ending.

422
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,394
Why do you think that?

423
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,310
Uh... uh...

424
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,178
Oh! They warned me not
to talk to you.

425
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,346
Who warned you?

426
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,484
Nobody!

433
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:43,495
Uh, the batter hit it
by accident, not by design.

434
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,370

’cause, um, er, uh...

438
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,261

on the field.

Hey, Milhouse,

00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,003
did I ever tell you

465
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,004
about the catch I made
when I was ten?

466
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,797
Greatest moment
