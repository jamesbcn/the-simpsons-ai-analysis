00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,444
Marge, I...

178
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,349
Damn it,
where's that card?

179
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,768
What card?

180
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,436
I wrote down what I was
gonna say on a card.

181
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:08,815
Stupid thing must have
fallen out of my pocket.

182
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,195
-(grunting)
-(horn honks)

183
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,491
-Is this it?
-What's it say?

184
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,405
"Marge, from the first
moment I saw you

185
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,405
"I never wanted to be
with anyone else.

186
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,958
"I don't have much to offer you
except all my love.

187
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,424
Will you marry me?"

188
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,415
That's the card.
Give it here.

189
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,086
Oh, Homer...

190
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,974
This is the most beautiful
moment of my life.

191
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,143
So, will you marry me?

192
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,853
Yes!

193
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,393
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

194
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,646
Yeah, she's gonna marry me!

195
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,478
In your face, everybody!

196
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,983
-Whoo-hoo!
-(car horn blares)

197
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,494
Dad, if the new baby
is a girl,

198
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,740
can we name her Ariel?

199
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,702
I'm sorry,
the baby's name will be

200
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,083
Kool Moe Dee Simpson.

201
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,449
-Ariel.
-Kool Moe Dee.

202
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,706
-Ariel.
-Kool Moe Dee.

203
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,119
You know, I had this
very same discussion

204
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,538
with your mother
ten years ago.

205
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,802
MARGE:
Homer, I've been thinking.

206
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,130
If the baby's a boy,

207
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,415
what do you think
of the name Larry?

208
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,798
Marge! We can't do that.

209
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,264
All the kids
will call him Larry Fairy.

210
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,095
Well, how about Louis?

211
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,430
They'll call him
Screwy Louie.

212
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,425
-Bob?
-Slob.

213
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,426

What about Bart?

Let's see...

217
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,517
Bart, cart, dart,
eeyart...

218
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,686
Nope. Can't see
any problem with that.

219
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,896
Wow. I'll take that ring.

220
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,447
Yes, sir.
And how will you be paying for it?

221
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,701
I don't know.

The tenth wedding

Hey, this marriage is
gonna last forever.

231
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,893
No matter how many times
I hear that

232
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,642
it always makes me laugh.

233
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:04,734
Cletus, do you take Aileen
to be your lawful wedded wife?

234
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,942

Marge, I'm sorry.

I wish I could afford
a better place.

240

Homer, I'd be lying if I said

241
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,753
that this is how
I pictured my wedding day,

242
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,211
but you are
how I pictured my husband.

243

Ohhh.

246
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,554
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here in the sight of God

247
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,216
and this casino
to join...

248
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,434
-Homer.

Marge.

250
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:44,731
In holy matrimony.
Beautiful.

251
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,560
Do you, Marjorie Bouvier,
take Homer J. Simpson

252
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,607
to be your
lawful wedded husband?

253
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,979
I do.

254
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,026
Homer, same question,
names reversed.

255
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,818
I do.

256
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,362
Then, by the power vested in me
by the state gaming commission

257
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,906
I pronounce you
man and wife.

00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,909
Here's $10 worth of chips.

259
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,491
You may kiss the bride.

260
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,576
Next!

261
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,119

A baby monitor.

267
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,595
Baby to Marge.
Baby to Marge.

268
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,805
Wah! Wah! Over.

269
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,395
Homer, I don't know how
we can afford all these things

270
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,481
on your salary.

271
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,987
Hey, why don't I apply
at the nuclear power plant?

272
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,950
I hear they pay pretty well.

273
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,370
I don't know.

274
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,278
I heard radiation
can make you sterile.

275

Now you tell me.

276
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,788
We only have
two openings

277
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:48,963
so I'm afraid one of you

278
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,711
will have to go home
empty-handed--

00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,920
Uh-oh! The cops!

354
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,632
"Fourth notice."

355
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,006
"90 days overdue."

356
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,933
"We break thumbs."

357
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,682
Homer, what are we
going to do?

358
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,273
-(doorbell rings)
-I don't know. I don't know.

359
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:55,639
Repo man. I'm here
for the baby's things.

360
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,228
Crib, mobile, monitor--

361
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,773
Oh, and the lady's ring,
I'm afraid.

362
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,977
(gasps)

363
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,986
Oh, dear.

364
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,448
Repossessing stuff is
the hardest part of my job.

365
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,537
<i>Dear Marge,</i>

366
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,004
<i>By the time you read this,</i>
<i>I will be gone.</i>

367
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,464
<i>You deserve all the finest</i>
<i>things in the world,</i>

368
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,165
<i>and although</i>
<i>I can give them to you,</i>

369
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,005
<i>they will be repossessed</i>

370
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,510
<i>and I will be hunted down</i>
<i>like a dog.</i>

371
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,263
<i>Also, it has become clear</i>

372
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,805
<i>that your family</i>
<i>doesn't want me here.</i>

373
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,889
MRS. BOUVIER: Shut up with that
pen scratching down there.

374
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:38,725
<i>I will send you every cent</i>
<i>I earn for the baby</i>

375
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:43,152
<i>but you will not see me again</i>
<i>until I am a man.</i>

376
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,906
(sobbing)

377
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,155
That is so sad.

378
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,117
Oh, come on, honey.

379
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,708
You know how it turns out.

380
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,303
After all,
you wouldn't be here today

381
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,629
if I hadn't become

382
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:05,923
the responsible head
of a household.

383
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,166
Hey Homer,

384
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,717
can we have a can of
frosting for lunch?

385
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,722
Okay.

386
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,931
"You will not see me again
until I am a man."

387
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,227
(sobbing)

388
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,521
Oh, Homer...

389
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,944
Homer!

390
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,823
There, there, dear.
We're all in shock.

391
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,201
I thought he'd two-time you
for a while first.

392
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,952
(gagging and choking)

393
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,075
This taco is
full of hair.

394
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,162
Uh-huh.

395
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,117
There's your
explanation.

396
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,542
(loud slurping)

397
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,047
-Ahhhh!
-Shall we tell Marge where he is?

398
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,720
Nah, let her read about it
in the society page.

399
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,677
Homer?! Oh...

400
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,932
Marge, listen,
we just saw--

401
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,055
-Don't be stupid.
-(grunts)

402
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,067
HOMER:
<i>Dear Marge, XXX</i>

403
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,030
<i>Homer.</i>

404
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,950
Big shots with their
stainless steel lunch boxes.

405
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,237
(honks horn)

406
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,327
(gasps)

407
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,082
They get doughnuts!

408
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,294
That's right.

409
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,213
All the colors
of the rainbow.

410
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,424
Wow.

411
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,469
Marge, what are
you doing up?

412
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,008
You need your rest, dear.

413
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,721
I heard a noise outside,
and thought it might be Homer.

414
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,013
Ay!
What the hell.

415
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,677
Marge, I've got
2 1/2 words for you.

416
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,597
Gulp 'n Blow.

417
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,055
Yeah, what do you want?

418
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,437
My husband by my side.

419
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,194
<i>You want fries with that?</i>

420
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,186
<i>Homer?!</i>

421
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,237
Marge?!

422
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,704
-Homer!
-Marge!

423
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,235
Holy cow, you're
as big as a house!

424
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,288
Homer, come home with me.

425
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,922
No, Marge,
I just can't.

426
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,840
I mean, look at me.
I'm a trainee.

427
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,760
They won't even tell me
what's in the secret sauce.

428
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,419
And I can't buy you
a decent wedding ring.

429
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:16,138
Any ring is fine,
as long as it's from you.

430
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,807
Marge...

431
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,561
<i>Pour vous.</i>

432
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,653
Oh!

433
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,654
Would you mind
if I took it off now?

434
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,482
The oil
is burning my finger.

435
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,487
Oh, sure.

436
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,621
Homer, do you know
why I married you?

437
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,828
'Cause I knocked you up?

438
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,948
No, because I love you.

439
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,499
Come home soon.

440
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,382
(growling)

441
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,385
MR. BURNS:
That's it...

442
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,483
That's it... come closer...

443
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,186
(laughing wickedly)

444
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,572
Ironic, isn't it?

445
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,318
The hunter
has become the hunted.

446
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,610
(laughing)

447
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:16,033
Oh, God, Smithers
I feel so alive!

448
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,363
You the boss?

449
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,197
-Yes.
-I'll call security, sir.

450
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,583
Well, listen to me,
Mr. Big Shot,

451
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,699
if you're looking
for the kind of employee

452
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,406
who takes abuse and never
sticks up for himself,

453
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,747
I'm your man!

454
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,632
You can treat me
like dirt and

455
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,419
I'll still kiss your butt
and call it ice cream!

456
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,423
And if you don't like it,
I can change!

457
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,676
Hold the phone, Smithers.

458
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,136
I like your attitude.

459
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,849
Feisty, yet spineless.

460
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,639
Sir, this man not only
failed the aptitude test

461
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,273
he got trapped
in a closet on his way out.

462
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,850
I don't care. I haven't
been this impressed

463
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,976
since I first laid eyes
on a young bootlick

464
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,323
named Wayland Smithers.

465
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,858
-You mean...?
-Welcome aboard, son.

466
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,902
I got the job.
I got the job!

467
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,196
Whoo hoo!

468
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,119
Only in America
could I get a job.

469
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,949
Who was that
young hellcat, Smithers?

470
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,084
-Homer Simpson, sir.
-Simpson, eh?

471
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,291
I'll remember that name.

472
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,461
Marge, Marge!

473
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,499
You're a little late.

474
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,292
She's gone
to the hospital.

475
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,585
The hospital?!

476
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,918
I'll drive you.

477
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,213
Thanks, Mom.

478
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,166
Don't ever call me that.

479
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,216
Marge! Marge,
where's the baby?

480
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,470
Right where you
left it.

481
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,391
-Shut up.
-Hey listen, fat boy--

482
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,720
No, you listen.

483
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,394
This is my wife,
and this is my kid,

484
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,313
and I'm paying for
this delivery.

485
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,481
So if you wanna stay

486
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,889
you better give me some respect.

487
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,767
Homer, does this mean...?

488
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,194
Starting tomorrow,
I'm a nuclear technician!

489
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,783
Good God!

490
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,858
And tomorrow morning,
I'm gonna buy your ring back,

491
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,364
then I'm going house hunting.

492
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,235
Doesn't your job
start tomorrow?

493
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,122
Somebody will
cover for me.

494
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,869
Homer, that's-- Oh!

495
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:44,871
Step aside.

496
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,502
I'll deliver this baby.

497
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,658
Why don't you
let me handle it, Homer.

498
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,577
Oh, a college boy, eh?

499
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,206
Homer, for God sakes,
let him deliver the baby!

500
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:56,553
Homie, isn't
he beautiful?

501
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,010
Hey, as long as he's got
eight fingers

502
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,641
and eight toes,
he's fine by me.

503
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:02,638
Oh, Bart!

504
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,009
Daddy's little angel.

505
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,008
Ah!

506
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,807
Why, you little--!

507
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,483
He did that on purpose!

508
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,611
How could he?
He's only ten minutes old.

509
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,950
Bart, Lisa, come
here for a minute.

510

You know, son,
the day you were born

511
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,743
I received the greatest gift
a man could have.

512
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,576
As the years went by,

513
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,001
your mother and I
were blessed twice more,

514
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,710
and not a day goes by that

515
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,840
we don't thank God
for all three of you.

516

I'm not pregnant!
