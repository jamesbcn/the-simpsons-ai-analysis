some exciting news.

(kids murmuring)

33
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:09,047
I'm here to tell you about
a field trip so amazing,

34
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:12,149
we've put "sign here" stickers
on the permission slips.

35
00:02:12,172 --> 00:02:15,302
As you recall, these stickers
came from last year's field trip

36
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,997
to the "sign here"
sticker factory.

37
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:19,289
But thanks to my
old navy buddy...

38
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,408
we both love to
shop at Old Navy...

39
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:23,689
the students of this school
will be taking a ride

40
00:02:23,697 --> 00:02:27,322
on a nuclear-powered,
attack-class submarine,

41
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:30,288

43
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,085
(chuckles) So you're
all excited, eh?

44
00:02:42,117 --> 00:02:43,661
ALL:
Yay!

45
00:02:43,683 --> 00:02:46,622
Well, that's too bad, because
many of you will not be going.

46
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:47,715
ALL:
Huh?!

47
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:51,348
There's limited room on the submarine,
so only the best-behaved students...

48
00:02:51,377 --> 00:02:53,511
as determined by me...

49
00:02:53,545 --> 00:02:55,179
will go on the trip.

50
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:00,075
- Whoo-hoo!
- Well, I get to go!

51
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,350
To increase the tension, everyone
starts with a clean slate.

52
00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:05,611
But from this moment on...

53
00:03:05,638 --> 00:03:07,522
I am the law.

54
00:03:07,545 --> 00:03:08,913
I hold the red pen.

Pranks, inside use of outside
voice, off-color whistling,

and you're stricken
from the list.

58
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,550

you stay crossed off.

00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:47,961
Sweetie, about the submarine...

69
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,478
what's your favorite food to eat
when you're disappointed?

70
00:03:50,493 --> 00:03:52,197
I'm going shopping tomorrow.

71
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:54,494
Ice cream sandwiches. Why?

72
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:59,455
What your mother is trying to say is we
don't think you can be good that long.

73
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,269
Mom, is that true?

74
00:04:01,296 --> 00:04:04,472
Well, that's sort of what
I was trying to say, but...

75
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:06,747
What your mother is
trying to say is...

76
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,325
No, you're wrong!
You're all wrong!

77
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:10,809
I didn't say anything.

78
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:13,055
- Were you thinking it?
- Yes.

79
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,664
Get real, ding-dong!

80
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,867
You've already done so much bad stuff,
Skinner's never gonna let you on that boat.

81
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:22,475
No, Skinner said I had a clean slate, so
right now, I'm as good as any other kid.

82
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:25,777
(Homer and Lisa laughing)

83
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,449
Good one, ding-dong.

84
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,343
Mom!

85
00:04:29,366 --> 00:04:32,515
Don't listen to them.
They're the ding-dongs.

86
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,265
Wha...?!

87
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:38,490
Bart, sweetie, this is an opportunity for
you to turn things around yet again.

88
00:04:38,514 --> 00:04:40,647
And I believe in you.

89
00:04:40,678 --> 00:04:41,984
Yet again.

90
00:04:42,026 --> 00:04:45,596
Thanks, Mom. I'll start by taking
my plate to the dishwasher.

91
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,340
Wherever that is.

92
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,254
(cupboards open, shut,
dish breaks)

93
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:53,639
Pfft. Marge, I love Bart as much
as you do, but actually not.

94
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:56,841
And that kid cannot go one week
without getting in trouble.

95
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:01,047
Now, if you'd be so kind as to start
my car for me, I'm going to Moe's.

96
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,110
(blowing air)

97
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,922

99
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:08,524

101
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:12,308
Whoo-hoo!

102
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:15,262
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm!

103
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:16,400
What are you doing?

104
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:18,000
To avoid temptation,
I'm getting rid

105
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:20,227
of all the things that could get
me in trouble at school.

106
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:23,190
I buried all my whoopee
cushions in the backyard.

107
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:27,771
(flatulence sounds)
Hmm?

108
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,666
(groans)

109
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:33,082
- What the...?
- That's not where I buried them.

110
00:05:33,106 --> 00:05:34,433
Come on!

111
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,438
Don't take my custom limo!

112
00:05:37,473 --> 00:05:40,867
At least let me sniff my coke
out of the floor mats!

113
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,956
(grunts)

114
00:05:41,984 --> 00:05:43,140

Oh, hi, little girl. What brings you
to see Uncle Krusty? (chuckles)

117
00:05:49,054 --> 00:05:50,742
Krusty, are you broke?

118
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:53,530
Yeah. All it takes is some
bad luck at the ponies,

119
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,694
worse luck in
the Bitcoin market,

120
00:05:55,734 --> 00:05:58,684
heavy investment in a
high-end bookmark company.

121
00:05:58,715 --> 00:06:01,145
You could do what
<i>Everybody Loves Raymond</i> did.

122
00:06:01,163 --> 00:06:03,097
Go off the air
while I'm still good?

123
00:06:03,124 --> 00:06:06,265
That horse has left the stable,
gone to the glue factory

124
00:06:06,288 --> 00:06:08,835
and has been used to
make art projects.

125
00:06:08,856 --> 00:06:11,351
I mean, you could sell
foreign rights to your show.

126
00:06:11,382 --> 00:06:13,072
Even <i>SpongeBob</i> did it.

127
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:17,760
<i>Buon compleanno, Squiduardo!</i>

128
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:19,745

guerra mondiale,</i>

No!

00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:37,050
Uh... it's cute stuff, but
I'm still broke, girlie.

135
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:40,092
Not my Monet! I only
looked at it once!

136
00:06:40,115 --> 00:06:43,786
What I'm saying is, you could produce
foreign versions of your TV show

137
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:46,263
with actors
from other countries.

138
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,070
Okay, I'll do it!

139
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:50,320
Not my Shetland dolphin!

140
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,648
Although I won't miss
the constant yapping.

141
00:06:52,697 --> 00:06:54,470
Papa!

142
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:56,608

Unauthorized meat-a-pult.
Off the list!

146
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,908
Lips touching the fountain.
Off the list.

147
00:07:26,957 --> 00:07:29,480
It's not my fault there's
no water pressure.

148
00:07:29,506 --> 00:07:32,912
Excuses are like handkerchiefs;
everybody's got one.

149
00:07:32,948 --> 00:07:35,550
- I don't have a handkerchief.
- Off the list!

150
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:40,158
Firm but fair, sir. Don't want any
troublemakers on our submarine.

151
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:42,496
Not bad, Simpson. Did
you wash your knees?

152
00:07:42,522 --> 00:07:44,134
Front <i>and</i> back, sir.

153
00:07:45,446 --> 00:07:48,016
You're like egg salad
at a picnic, Simpson.

154
00:07:48,036 --> 00:07:51,309
Even when you look good,
we know you're going bad.

155
00:07:51,332 --> 00:07:52,402
Principal Skinner?

156
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:57,105
I object to this arbitrary use of power
and request I be taken off the list.

157
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:59,170
- Off the list!
- Thank you.

158
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,167
Oh, man! Five days
without pranking?

159
00:08:06,198 --> 00:08:08,964
I'm getting strange red marks.
But I'm gonna make it!

160
00:08:08,982 --> 00:08:11,330
(engine backfiring)

161
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:13,014
Uh-oh.
(alarms buzzing)

162
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,208
Something's wrong with
my long yellow car.

163
00:08:15,243 --> 00:08:16,126
(starter chugs)

164
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:18,265
Any of you kids got
a Triple A card?

165
00:08:19,211 --> 00:08:21,278
What? No.
I'll be late.

166
00:08:21,313 --> 00:08:23,414
Skinner will cross my name
off the list.

167
00:08:23,448 --> 00:08:24,648
(grunts)

168
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:42,282
All fixed up!

00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,515
Muddy footprints on
the school floor.

175
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,297
- (gasps)
- I've broken a ten-year-old's spirit.

176
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,258
Time to celebrate with a

179
00:09:22,582 --> 00:09:26,050
No, Mother, I did not
use any of your talc.

180
00:09:26,085 --> 00:09:27,937
I don't know why the
bottle feels lighter.

181
00:09:27,978 --> 00:09:30,244
Maybe you're just getting
stronger!

182
00:09:30,507 --> 00:09:33,351

If you examine
your "Krusty Kit,"

202
00:10:13,777 --> 00:10:16,527
you're gonna find
unremovable green hair dye,

203

a used red nose and a guidebook
on how to capture a monkey.

rubles, renminbi, baht...
but they all mean money,

210
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:39,806
which rhymes with funny, which
you can be if you want.

211
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:40,908
I don't care.

212

Just do the Krusty show in your
country and send me ten percent.

Then send me another 60%.

214
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,676
Then five percent more,
and you're good.

215
00:10:54,978 --> 00:10:56,353
Nice job, Simpson.

216
00:10:56,384 --> 00:10:59,282
You even got my Suze Orman tape
unstuck from the cassette player.

217
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:02,199
She's the reason I was able
to purchase a new watch band.

Okay, I washed your car like you asked,
I did your paper route, and I'm sorry.

221
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,317
I really am.

261
00:13:09,744 --> 00:13:11,278
there's not much you can say,

262
00:13:11,328 --> 00:13:13,422

00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,836
- Fire that torpedo, Milhouse.
- Aye, aye.

269
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:29,932
- Where'd it go?
- It was just imaginary.

270
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:33,989
I know a kid should never turn to his
father for help, but I got screwed.

271
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,794
Is there anything you can do?

272

As I always say, don't
get mad; get dinner.

304
00:15:24,777 --> 00:15:28,629
Now, I could investigate further, but you
don't want to sit in a jail all weekend.

Chief, that was
awfully arbitrary.

That's always been our deal.

Do you want the head?

00:16:26,981 --> 00:16:29,276
No, no, God, no.

So avoid mirrors.

334
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,854
There never was a monkey.

335
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:03,802
I was just tellin' stories

338
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,066
Well, you see there, they need
to hit the word "monkey" harder

339
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:11,464
if they want to get a laugh.

340
00:17:11,503 --> 00:17:13,199
Don't you get what I'm
trying to tell you?

341
00:17:13,214 --> 00:17:16,699
You are now the least popular
Krusty in the world.

342
00:17:16,723 --> 00:17:18,489
What about Romanian Krusty?

343
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:20,688
What, you mean
President-for-Life Krusty?

00:17:22,632 --> 00:17:24,179
I still get a piece, right?

346
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,686
Putz. You're the least successful
version of you there is.

347
00:17:27,731 --> 00:17:28,798
A piece.

348
00:17:28,824 --> 00:17:31,335
Now, let's see where this goes.

349
00:17:31,621 --> 00:17:34,191
Irish Krusty, this is your baby.

350
00:17:34,222 --> 00:17:36,941
The only thing working
round here is your libido.

351
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:42,612
Now I know why Ma walked into the sea with
her pockets full of rocks, on Christmas.

352
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:46,090
Why doesn't this
material work for <i>me?</i>

353
00:17:47,344 --> 00:17:50,047
Seymour, the cops
are on their way.

354
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,914
(siren wails)

355
00:17:53,718 --> 00:17:56,752
Here's a bus ticket to
Juarez and your fake I.D.

356
00:17:57,423 --> 00:18:00,400
SKINNER: Oh, come on, I don't look
anything like this "Dick Fiddler."

357
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:02,445
No, you don't... yet.

358
00:18:04,577 --> 00:18:07,719
I don't want to sound ungrateful, but
could I eat one of the potatoes?

359
00:18:07,746 --> 00:18:11,484
Sorry, but Dick Fiddler
is allergic to potatoes.

360
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:12,689
I understand.

361
00:18:12,732 --> 00:18:15,267
(both giggling)

362
00:18:20,815 --> 00:18:23,410
Dad? Thanks for
sticking up for me.

363
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,918
(laughs)

364
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,199
Someday I may have
to fake my own death.

365
00:18:27,216 --> 00:18:29,474
And maybe you can
help me with that.

366
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:31,489
- Sure, Dad.
- Someday soon.

367
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,611
As in, what are you
doing this Friday?

368
00:18:35,804 --> 00:18:37,156
Aah! Dick Fiddler!

369
00:18:37,187 --> 00:18:39,496
Gentlemen, I can't
run away from what I've done.

370
00:18:39,515 --> 00:18:41,570
I accept that I
killed my mother.

371
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:43,927
My whole life,
she's belittled me.

372
00:18:43,963 --> 00:18:46,408
Maybe deep down, I'm glad.

373
00:18:46,427 --> 00:18:48,134
This has gone far enough.

374
00:18:48,175 --> 00:18:52,511
I'm starting to think this "school
project" is more than meets the eye.

375
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:54,413
Mother?
You're alive?

376
00:18:54,454 --> 00:18:57,110
Seymour, when this
fat guy and his kid

377
00:18:57,145 --> 00:18:59,352
asked me to fake my
death to punish you,

378
00:18:59,386 --> 00:19:02,539
I said, "Sure, that's
something to do."

379
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:07,255
You know, when you glare like
that, you look really beautiful.

380
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:08,594
(grumbles):
Mm-hmm.

381
00:19:08,624 --> 00:19:12,891
But when I just heard you say
you were glad to see me dead...

382
00:19:12,922 --> 00:19:16,195
I thought, "Now I'm gonna be
meaner to you than ever."

383
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:17,492
How is that possible?

384
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:20,617
I've stopped taking those
pills that keep me nice.

385
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:22,089

00:19:57,889 --> 00:20:01,114
Well, we did consider
letting you keep more.

00:20:21,523 --> 00:20:23,391
I'm very bad in a crisis.

402
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:27,534
I also can't ad-lib, memorize
anything, improv or tell a joke.

Uh, you know, why did you

Well, I was supposed to
be one of the sad ones.
