school supply

Ah, if it isn't
Eavesdrop Ernie

21
00:02:35,193 --> 00:02:37,010
and the Listen-In Bunch.

22
00:02:37,078 --> 00:02:39,730
I'd like you boys
to meet Dahlia Brinkley.

23
00:02:39,798 --> 00:02:41,682
She's the only
Springfield Elementary alum

24
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,650
ever to advance
to the Ivy League!

25
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:46,286
There's a car in the parking lot
with a Yale sticker on it.

26
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:48,505
It's gotta be you!

27
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:50,124
I just graduated from Yale,

28
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:52,559
and thought I'd pay
a visit, from Yale,

29
00:02:52,627 --> 00:02:54,728
to the little school
where it all began.

30
00:02:56,297 --> 00:02:58,365
I plan to attend
an Ivy League school myself.

31
00:02:58,433 --> 00:03:00,701
I do have a 4.0 GPA.

32
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:03,020
She can do the kind
of math that has letters.

33
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:05,155
Watch. What's X, Lisa?

34
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:07,024
Well, that depends.

35
00:03:07,092 --> 00:03:09,426
Sorry. She did it
yesterday.

36
00:03:09,494 --> 00:03:11,512
I believe you. What
else have you got?

37
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:14,481
Um, I'm treasurer
of the Jazz Club,

38
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:17,768
<i>and</i> started the school's
recycling society.

39
00:03:19,304 --> 00:03:20,771
Nice. And?

40
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:22,206
Uh, that's it.

41
00:03:22,273 --> 00:03:24,141
Two clubs?

42
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:26,760
Well, that's a bridge bid,
not an Ivy League application.

43
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:29,163
But I'm only in second grade.

44
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,231
By your age, I'd been
the dominant force

45
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:33,467
in dozens of
extracurricular activities.

46
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:35,836

Same year we got
new playground sand.

52
00:03:52,504 --> 00:03:55,873
Yes, it was.
Mm-hmm.

53
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:00,027
Thrust! Parry! Dodge!

54
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:01,495
Poke! Come on, Maggie.

55
00:04:01,563 --> 00:04:03,196
I need to get
good at fencing

56
00:04:03,248 --> 00:04:05,916
so I can put it on my
resume and get into Yale.

57
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:07,651
Don't be scared.

58
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,853
I won't hurt my
widdle sister.

59
00:04:15,143 --> 00:04:17,044
Ooh!

60
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:27,454
Oh!

61
00:04:33,678 --> 00:04:36,547
Sweetie, you can
still go to McGill--

62
00:04:36,614 --> 00:04:38,582
the Harvard of Canada.

63
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,984
Anything that's the something
of the something

64
00:04:41,052 --> 00:04:42,986
isn't really the anything
of anything.

65
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:46,924
Hello, Flanders.

66
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:48,792
Don't you have a neighbor
on the other side?

67
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,260
Indeedily-doodily I do,

68
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:52,396
and I love him just
as much as you.

69
00:04:52,463 --> 00:04:55,132
It's a Flanders sandwich
with great neighbor bread!

70
00:04:56,901 --> 00:05:00,704
Bart, call me Walter Matthau,
'cause I'm a bad-news bearer.

71
00:05:00,772 --> 00:05:03,207
I'm resigning as manager
of your Little League team.

72
00:05:03,274 --> 00:05:05,042
What?! Why?!

73
00:05:05,109 --> 00:05:08,512
In the last game, our
shortstop hit a long foul ball,

74
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,681
but the umpire
called it a homerun,

75
00:05:10,748 --> 00:05:14,451
and I let it go
without saying a word.

76
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:17,321
I just don't like the monster
I've become.

77
00:05:18,623 --> 00:05:21,525
Oh. But without a coach,
we can't play!

78
00:05:21,593 --> 00:05:23,777
Homie, maybe
you could do it.

79
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:25,512
Sorry, Marge.
Last time I stepped

80
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,015
on a baseball
field, I got tased.

81
00:05:28,082 --> 00:05:31,652
You know, someday these kids
will be out of the house,

82
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:34,721
and you'll regret not spending
more time with them.

83
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:37,457
That's a problem
for future Homer.

84
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:39,760
Man, I don't envy that guy.

85
00:05:46,484 --> 00:05:48,769
Can't play baseball.
What am I gonna do?

86
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,155
Son, how would you like
to spend the summer

87
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:53,724
building wooden boats
by hand

88
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,692
with master craftsmen?

89
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,694
How'd you like to kiss my ass?

90
00:06:00,715 --> 00:06:02,783
Look at me,
I'm Whitey Ford!

91
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,484
Huh?

92
00:06:04,552 --> 00:06:05,886
What's going on?

93
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:07,721
We got a new coach!

94
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:08,989
Awesome!
Who is it?

95
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,207
It's me.

96
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:11,341
Lisa?!

97
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:13,143
What, you can't stand the idea

98
00:06:13,211 --> 00:06:16,546
of a girl coaching
a boys' baseball team?

99
00:06:16,614 --> 00:06:18,649
No, we can't stand
the idea of someone

100
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:22,286
who knows nothing about baseball
coaching a baseball team.

101
00:06:22,353 --> 00:06:25,255
Hey, there have been plenty
of female managers in baseball.

102
00:06:25,323 --> 00:06:27,891
Connie Mack, Sandy Alomar,

103
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,894
Terry Francona, Pinky Higgins.

104
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:32,296
Those are dudes!

105
00:06:32,363 --> 00:06:34,731
Really? They sound like...

106
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:36,667
I mean... Well, the thing...

107
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:39,536
Ooh... no.

108
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:48,550
Okay, bottom line--

109
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:50,534
I need
an extra-curricular activity,

110
00:06:50,602 --> 00:06:53,170
and no one else will
coach you loveable losers.

111
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:55,773
We're not losers. Last year,
we finished six and five.

112
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:57,375
And we're not loveable.

113
00:06:57,442 --> 00:06:59,577
We had a tall, freckled-faced
kid on the team

114
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:01,529
that we picked on till he quit.

115
00:07:01,597 --> 00:07:03,080
Hey, Splatter-face!

116
00:07:03,148 --> 00:07:05,683
How's the weather
up there?

117
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:08,102
It's too bad,
'cause he's a great hitter,

118
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,854
but it's worth it.

119
00:07:09,922 --> 00:07:12,590
Look, if you want to play
liability-insured baseball,

120
00:07:12,658 --> 00:07:14,225
I'm your only shot.

121
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:18,246
Fine, you can be our coach.

122
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,381
Thanks. You can be
the free safety.

123
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:22,683
Wrong sport.
I mean the point guard.

124
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:25,152
Also wrong.
I'm gonna do a little research.

125
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,821
A little's not gonna be enough,
honey pie.

126
00:07:26,888 --> 00:07:28,256
Don't call me honey pie.

127
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,490
You got it, tootsie pop.

128
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:32,159
Get a room, you two.

129
00:07:32,227 --> 00:07:33,527
We're brother and sister.

130
00:07:33,595 --> 00:07:35,830
So are my parents, I think.

131
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:40,651
Hey, Dad?

132
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:42,119
Hey, pal, how you doing?

133
00:07:42,187 --> 00:07:43,888
Fine. I was hoping

134
00:07:43,956 --> 00:07:45,756
you and your friends
could tell me something

135
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:47,291
about baseball strategy.

136
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:49,293
The only thing I
know about strategy is

137
00:07:49,361 --> 00:07:51,028
that whatever the
manager does, it's wrong,

138
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,031
unless it works, in which case
he's a button-pusher.

139
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,400
I hate guys that just
push buttons all day.

140
00:07:56,468 --> 00:07:58,069
You just push
buttons all day.

141
00:07:58,136 --> 00:07:59,837
You know, ever since
Obama came in,

142
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:01,539
you've got all the answers,
don't you?

143
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,040
Ugh! Does anyone here

144
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,742
actually know anything
about baseball?

145
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,128
Uh, the guys
in that booth down there.

146
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:13,517
As a pitcher, Cliff Lee is
clearly superior

147
00:08:13,585 --> 00:08:15,136
to Zack Greinke.

148
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,787
Uh, yes, I completely agree,

149
00:08:16,855 --> 00:08:19,991
with the following
<i>colossal</i> exception.

150
00:08:20,058 --> 00:08:22,410
Before the fourth inning
after a road loss

151
00:08:22,477 --> 00:08:24,362
in a domed stadium.

152
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:26,330
Then it's good to be Greinke.

153
00:08:26,398 --> 00:08:28,115
Uh, unless he's got a bunion,

154
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:30,851
in which case he is notably
ineffective.

155
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:35,122
Wow. I'm surprised you guys know
so much about a sport.

156
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,192
Oh, Lisa, baseball is a game
played by the dexterous,

157
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,295
but only understood
by the Poin-dexterous.

158
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:44,115
If you understand
what I've laid out there.

159
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:46,767
The key to understanding
the game is sabermetrics.

160
00:08:46,835 --> 00:08:48,102
Huh?!

161
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,839
The field was developed
by statistician Bill James.

162
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:55,710
I made baseball as much fun
as doing your taxes!

163
00:08:55,777 --> 00:08:57,411
Using sabermetrics,

164
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:59,613
even an eight-year-old girl
can run a ball club

165
00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:01,649
with the sagacity
of a Stengel,

166
00:09:01,717 --> 00:09:04,301
and the single-mindedness
of a Steinbrenner.

167
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:07,138
I call it a Stein-stengel...

168
00:09:07,205 --> 00:09:09,190
Thanks, guys.

169
00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:11,942
Hey, speaking of stats,

170
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,477
I'm none too pleased

171
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:15,012
about your ratio
of seats occupied

172
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,881
to beers ordered.

173
00:09:16,948 --> 00:09:18,315
You mean
our SOBO?

174
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:19,884
Let's
calculate it now!

175
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:26,123
What's the conversion
factor for ginger beer?

176
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,793
Refreshingness
over effervescence.

177
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,494
Plus or minus tang.

178
00:09:30,562 --> 00:09:32,563
Oh, why did I advertise
my drink specials

179
00:09:32,631 --> 00:09:34,565
in <i>Scientific American?</i>

180
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:36,233
I can think of
three reasons.

181
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:37,802
First of all, you...
Shut up.

182
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,438
So we're one-one in the third,

183
00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:42,506
and Isotots manager Lisa Simpson

184
00:09:42,574 --> 00:09:45,976
rearranges her defense
one more time.

185
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,212
I haven't seen this many books
in a dugout

186
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,448
since Albert Einstein
went canoeing.

187
00:09:52,334 --> 00:09:55,035
Everyone shift
towards right!

188
00:09:55,103 --> 00:09:57,304
Huh?

189
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:03,461
I caught a white apple!

190
00:10:35,293 --> 00:10:37,595
Okay. Everyone
study two-out situations,

191
00:10:37,662 --> 00:10:39,063
count management,

192
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:41,499
and I'll be back
with some gluten-free crackers.

193
00:10:42,984 --> 00:10:44,885
Your spreadsheets!

194
00:10:44,953 --> 00:10:47,655
Oh, my stupid sister's taken
the fun out of baseball.

195
00:10:47,722 --> 00:10:49,423
What happened to stealing bases,

196
00:10:49,491 --> 00:10:52,526
the suicide squeeze,
throwing a little chin music?

197
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:54,462
We're no longer
cellar dwellers.

198
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,964
Well, the team isn't.

199
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,933
This isn't the game
I grew up with,

200
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,802
the game played in the misty
ballparks of Enron Field,

201
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:04,972
or Pac Bell,
then SBC, now AT&T Park.

202
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,992
And from now on,
I'm gonna play my game.

203
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:10,094
Dummyball.

204
00:11:10,162 --> 00:11:12,296
Bart Simpson on deck,

205
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:14,832
his bat's just hungering
for a homer,

206
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,301
like Chronos for his children.

207
00:11:17,369 --> 00:11:18,802
Speaking of Homer,

208
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,905
Bart's father's name is,
you guessed it,

209
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,706
not on my fact sheet.

210
00:11:22,774 --> 00:11:26,443
Bart, this guy's walked
the last two batters,

211
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:28,479
and if he walks you,
we win the game.

212
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:29,847
Don't swing at anything!

213
00:11:29,915 --> 00:11:31,115
But I'm on a hot streak.

214
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:35,035
Hot streaks are
a statistical illusion.

215
00:11:35,103 --> 00:11:37,288
I wish you were a
statistical illusion.

216
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:39,807
Well, there's a 97 %
chance I'm not,

217
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,842
so do what I say.

218
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,899
Ball one!

219
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:52,453
Ball two!

220
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:54,321
Don't swing.

221
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,042
I've ruined your favorite thing!

222
00:11:58,109 --> 00:11:59,893
Oh...

223
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,079
Bart! Bart! Bart!

224
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,215
You disobeyed
your manager!

225
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:22,850
So what?
We won.

226
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:25,019
Bart! Bart! Bart!

227
00:12:25,086 --> 00:12:27,488
Here's what:
you're off the team!

228
00:12:27,556 --> 00:12:29,890
Get him out
of here, boys.

229
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,294
Conflicted,
conflicted, conflicted.

230
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:48,149
Come on, guys.

231
00:12:48,192 --> 00:12:49,659
I had to get rid of Bart.

232
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,894
But he socked a
walk-off dinger.

233
00:12:51,962 --> 00:12:53,796
That dinger was a fluke.

234
00:12:53,864 --> 00:12:55,732
Not that I have
to defend myself to you.

235
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,167
Managers manage,
and players play.

236
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,819
Do alligators
alligate?

237
00:12:59,887 --> 00:13:01,054
I don't know... yes!

238
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:02,088
I'm scared.

239
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:06,926
Here's my uniform,

240
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,696
since I won't be
needing it anymore.

241
00:13:09,763 --> 00:13:10,847
Whoo-hoo!

242
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:12,298
Underpants dinner!

243
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:13,650
No, it's not.

244
00:13:13,717 --> 00:13:14,717
Aww.

245
00:13:14,785 --> 00:13:16,185
You know, Lis,

246
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,920
I'm glad I'm not
playing baseball anymore.

247
00:13:17,988 --> 00:13:20,323
I think I'm more
interested in soccer.

248
00:13:20,391 --> 00:13:21,224
Ow!

249
00:13:25,646 --> 00:13:26,879
Hey. Cut it out!

250
00:13:26,947 --> 00:13:28,464
You're upsetting
the gravy boat.

251
00:13:28,532 --> 00:13:30,683
I'll put a stop
to this nonsense.

252
00:13:33,253 --> 00:13:36,222
Lisa, can't you let your
brother back on the team?

253
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:41,044
Fly balls and fungoes come and
go, but family is forever.

254
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,279
Sorry Marge, I got
to call bullcrap on that.

255
00:13:43,347 --> 00:13:46,582
The '69 Mets will live on
forever, but do you think

256
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,085
anyone cares about Ron Swoboda's
wife and kids?

257
00:13:49,153 --> 00:13:52,105
Not me, and, I assume,
not Ron Swoboda!

258
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:54,207
What about
Bart's feelings?

259
00:13:54,274 --> 00:13:56,309
Boys don't have feelings.
They have muscles.

260
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,012
Why do you say
such ridiculous things?

261
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:01,080
They sound good in my brain,

262
00:14:01,148 --> 00:14:05,885
then my tongue makes not the
words sound very good, formally.

263
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,814
"Mama Bear said,

264
00:14:17,881 --> 00:14:20,683
'I'm sure Sister Bear
will come to her senses.'"

265
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:24,654
"Then Pete Rose plowed into
his friend Ray Fosse..."

266
00:14:24,722 --> 00:14:28,391
"...dislocating Fosse's shoulder
in a meaningless game."

267
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:31,728
"He had earned the
nickname 'Charlie Hustle'..."

268
00:14:31,795 --> 00:14:33,229
"Mama Bear said,

269
00:14:33,297 --> 00:14:35,998
'Families should stick together
because...'"

270
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:37,567
"...personal feelings get
between him and home plate!"

271
00:14:37,634 --> 00:14:38,768
"'...anything
else is unbearable!'"

272
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,370
Excuse me?

273
00:14:40,437 --> 00:14:41,738
With all this racket,

274
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:44,173
my boys can't get
their 16 hours sleep.

275
00:14:47,911 --> 00:14:50,079
So, because of your
on-base percentage, Nelson,

276
00:14:50,147 --> 00:14:52,165
you're the new leadoff
hitter. Questions?

277
00:14:52,232 --> 00:14:53,816
When's Bart
coming back?

278
00:14:53,884 --> 00:14:55,218
He's not.
He thought he was better

279
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:57,153
than the laws of probability.

280
00:14:57,221 --> 00:14:59,722
Anyone else think he's better
than the laws of probability?

281
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:03,976
Well, you're not!

282
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:07,196
With me here in the booth is
brand-new color commentator

283
00:15:07,264 --> 00:15:10,116
and former Isotots
great, Bart Simpson.

284
00:15:10,184 --> 00:15:11,784
Bart, do you
miss the game?

285
00:15:11,852 --> 00:15:13,352
No, no, no, no.

286
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,821
I got a lot goin' on.

287
00:15:14,888 --> 00:15:16,923
I'm sure you do.

288
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,327
Milhouse hits a frozen rope
just past the diving shortstop.

289
00:15:21,395 --> 00:15:22,762
There's a play
at the plate!

290
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,363
He's... safe.

291
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:26,632
And that's all
she wrote.

292
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,601
It's a triumph of
number-crunching

293
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:29,902
over the human spirit.

294
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,771
And it's about time.

295
00:15:49,344 --> 00:15:50,744
Look, Dad.

296
00:15:50,812 --> 00:15:52,646
"Players and
Coaches Entrance."

297
00:15:52,714 --> 00:15:54,715
Hey, let's hold hands
and skip inside.

298
00:15:57,402 --> 00:15:59,787
Well, let's go
to the bleachers.

299
00:15:59,854 --> 00:16:02,022
I brought an air horn
and a megaphone.

300
00:16:02,073 --> 00:16:03,190
Testing...

301
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,527
Actually, I'm taking you

302
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:10,965
on a "special little guy
super happy fun" day.

303
00:16:11,032 --> 00:16:12,633
Are you taking me
to the dentist?

304
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,352
You're not going
to the dentist.

305
00:16:18,607 --> 00:16:21,308
You know, Mom, after only seven
hours in this amusement park,

306
00:16:21,376 --> 00:16:23,043
I'm finally
enjoying myself.

307
00:16:23,094 --> 00:16:24,711
I'm actually starting
to forget about...

308
00:16:26,064 --> 00:16:27,848
Lisa?

309
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,149
She wants to
talk to you.

310
00:16:29,217 --> 00:16:30,234
Hey Lis.

311
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:31,769
Bart, I need you.

312
00:16:31,853 --> 00:16:34,405
Ralph can't play,
'cause he's too juiced.

313
00:16:34,472 --> 00:16:38,626
I didn't know what I was putting
into my body.

314
00:16:39,894 --> 00:16:41,445
Sorry, sis.
I've moved on.

315
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:44,164
And my days of listening
to my manager are over.

316
00:16:44,232 --> 00:16:45,732
Son, you should always listen
to your manager.

317
00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:48,619
Mike Scioscia!

318
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:50,454
Didn't you get
radiation poisoning

319
00:16:50,538 --> 00:16:52,589
working at the
Springfield Nuclear Plant?

320
00:16:52,674 --> 00:16:53,957
I sure did,

321
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:55,793
and it gave me
super-managing powers!

322
00:16:55,877 --> 00:16:57,795
I also demagnetize
credit cards.

323
00:16:58,913 --> 00:17:01,515
Bart, I have
two pieces of advice.

324
00:17:01,582 --> 00:17:03,684
First, keep your arms
in the damn car.

325
00:17:03,751 --> 00:17:05,102
Whoa!

326
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:07,754
Secondly, I don't care if
your manager is your sister,

327
00:17:07,806 --> 00:17:11,258
Dick Drago's mustache,
or Oscar Gamble's afro.

328
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:13,193
A player should always listen
to his skipper.

329
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:15,529
That's how I got these three
World Series rings.

330
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:19,616
Never mind that.
I'll win more.

331
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:21,201
But you owe it to your sister,

332
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:23,153
and the great game of baseball--

333
00:17:23,238 --> 00:17:24,771
wacky face for the camera--

334
00:17:24,823 --> 00:17:27,991
to go back
and help your team.

335
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:29,526
Now, who wants
funnel cake?

336
00:17:29,594 --> 00:17:31,962
You got some great
raw ingredients, kid.

337
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,280
Open up your
stance a little.

338
00:17:33,348 --> 00:17:36,667
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

339
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:38,001
That's okay.

340
00:17:38,086 --> 00:17:40,037
You just didn't
have it today.

341
00:17:40,105 --> 00:17:41,989
Not everything's
baseball.

342
00:17:42,057 --> 00:17:43,424
Yes, it is.

343
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,562
Oh! What am I gonna do?

344
00:17:48,629 --> 00:17:50,597
I need a pinch-runner
with speed!

345
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:52,950
How about a benchwarmer
who's afraid of puppets?

346
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:56,487
Did someone order
a happy ending?

347
00:17:56,554 --> 00:17:57,688
Bart!

348
00:17:57,756 --> 00:17:59,356
Oh!

349
00:17:59,424 --> 00:18:03,394
Now get out there
and kick a field goal!

350
00:18:03,461 --> 00:18:06,063
Kidding.

351
00:18:06,131 --> 00:18:08,632
And that's why anyone
who invested with Lenny Dykstra

352
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,467
really should call that number.

353
00:18:10,535 --> 00:18:11,935
Lawyers are standing by.

354
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:14,538
Simpson on first,
taking a big lead.

355
00:18:14,606 --> 00:18:17,007
Oh, looks like he's
gonna swipe the bag.

356
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:18,509
No, no.

357
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:20,210
Don't steal.

358
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:31,972
And there he goes!

359
00:18:40,281 --> 00:18:42,716
He's stealing third.

360
00:18:42,784 --> 00:18:45,486
Okay, okay, he's stolen third.

361
00:18:45,553 --> 00:18:47,721
But surely, that's the limit
of his cockiness.

362
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:50,124
I'm stealing home!

363
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:54,678
No! The computer says
it's statistically impossible!

364
00:18:54,746 --> 00:18:56,146
Bah.
Computers.

365
00:18:56,214 --> 00:18:58,365
They'll never replace my
Huffnagle autocollator!

366
00:18:58,433 --> 00:19:00,067
Crank it, Smithers.
Crank it!

367
00:19:00,135 --> 00:19:01,902
It's, uh, seizing up, sir.

368
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,104
Yes, well apply
more goose grease.

369
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,876
Stealing home.
It's so impossible.

370
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:12,229
It's against every
sensible instinct.

371
00:19:12,313 --> 00:19:13,564
It's, it's...

372
00:19:21,005 --> 00:19:24,107
It's the most exciting
play in baseball.

373
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:26,410
Go, Bart!

374
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:30,330
If he makes it,
that's my son!

375
00:19:37,238 --> 00:19:39,573
You're out!

376
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:42,409
The Isotots lose.

377
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:46,530
Now to begin my off-season
follow-home robberies.

378
00:19:46,598 --> 00:19:48,165
I'll see you in
the parking lot,

379
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:51,852
but you won't see me
until it's too late.

380
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,488
You stink!

381
00:19:57,158 --> 00:19:58,225
Did I make it?

382
00:19:58,293 --> 00:19:59,376
No.

383
00:19:59,444 --> 00:20:00,861
But you did
do something.

384
00:20:00,928 --> 00:20:03,030
You made me
love baseball.

385
00:20:03,097 --> 00:20:05,315
Not as a collection
of numbers,

386
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,202
but as an unpredictable,
passionate game

387
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:11,622
beaten in excitement only
by every other sport.

388
00:20:11,706 --> 00:20:13,874
I guess your
computer was right.

389
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:16,844
Maybe it was, but according
to my calculations,

390
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:20,180
you're a great brother
51 % of the time.

391
00:20:20,248 --> 00:20:23,250
And according
to my gut, you're okay, too.

392
00:20:23,318 --> 00:20:24,551
Can you put a number on it?

393
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:30,474
Aww...

394
00:20:32,844 --> 00:20:36,363
Conflict resolved.
Conflict resolved.

395
00:20:36,431 --> 00:20:38,148
<i>Conflict resolved.</i>
