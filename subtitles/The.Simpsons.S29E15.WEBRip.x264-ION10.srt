1
00:00:46,698 --> 00:00:48,832
D'oh!

2
00:00:55,374 --> 00:00:56,374
D'oh!

3
00:01:06,385 --> 00:01:08,430
<i>They fought for years</i>

4
00:01:08,454 --> 00:01:10,065
<i>With guns and garden shears</i>

5
00:01:10,089 --> 00:01:12,734
<i>Years, years, years,
tears, tears, tears</i>

6
00:01:12,758 --> 00:01:18,373
<i>It's the Itchy and
Scratchy Marathon!</i>

7
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:37,226
Sponsored by
delicious Cream of Rye.

8
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:40,696
Which one's the cat?

9
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,500
Okay.

10
00:01:44,535 --> 00:01:46,836
Hour 14 of our marathon.

11
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:51,006
Now let's watch
episode 10,433.

12
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:53,242
Cat Scratch Cleaver!

13
00:01:53,277 --> 00:01:55,077
Enough with the cartoons.

14
00:01:55,112 --> 00:01:56,612
You'll rot your brains.

15
00:02:00,284 --> 00:02:01,617
Leave brain alone.

16
00:02:01,652 --> 00:02:05,354
I've been watching so much TV,
I can't move my head.

17
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:07,056
- I'll fix him.
- Careful, Dad!

18
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:09,758
If I'd have been careful,
I wouldn't have had you.

19
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:17,266
Now I can't go to school.
Or church.

20
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:19,368
Hallelujah!

21
00:02:19,403 --> 00:02:21,737
We're going to spend
family time together

22
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:23,739
without watching TV.

23
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:24,740
Mom is right.

24
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:26,876
Americans watch way too much TV.

25
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:28,711
How many hours?
Let me Google that.

26
00:02:28,746 --> 00:02:32,114
Instead of TV, I typed TB.

27
00:02:32,149 --> 00:02:33,916
Let me Google that.

28
00:02:35,086 --> 00:02:37,253
Turn off the devices, pronto!

29
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:38,621
Pronto. Odd word.

30
00:02:38,656 --> 00:02:40,256
Let me Google that.

31
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,224
Hey, I'm doing
something educational.

32
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,893
Educational, my foot.

33
00:02:43,928 --> 00:02:45,561
I saw pixels.

34
00:02:45,596 --> 00:02:47,129
It's TunnelCraft.

35
00:02:47,164 --> 00:02:50,299
A simulated world where you
explore, mine resources,

36
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:53,002
and work with friends to build
replicas of real buildings.

37
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:54,169
Can you die in it?

38
00:02:54,205 --> 00:02:56,305
- Yes.
- It's a video game.

39
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,340
I got a family activity for ya.

40
00:02:58,376 --> 00:03:00,910
In the Depression, we'd sit
around the wood stove

41
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:03,479
and sing songs about poverty.

42
00:03:03,514 --> 00:03:05,848
<i>Old poor Joe,
the starving boy</i>

43
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:07,683
<i>Had worms burrow
in his feet</i>

44
00:03:07,718 --> 00:03:10,519
<i>He heard there was
work in Portland</i>

45
00:03:10,555 --> 00:03:12,454
<i>But sadly he heard wrong</i>

46
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,324
<i>Oh, the railroad bulls,
they rousted him</i>

47
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:17,426
<i>And stuck him in a sack</i>

48
00:03:17,461 --> 00:03:19,628
<i>They tied him to the train</i>

49
00:03:19,664 --> 00:03:21,864
<i>And pulled him down the track</i>

50
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:23,465
<i>They threw him off the bridge</i>

51
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:25,178
<i>And they kicked him
in the head and they...</i>

52
00:03:25,202 --> 00:03:26,335
Enough!

53
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,781
I know what we're going to do.

54
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:28,882
We're going to go out.

55
00:03:28,906 --> 00:03:30,205
We're going to get some books

56
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:32,041
and we're going to read
those books.

57
00:03:32,076 --> 00:03:33,943
This is the very last chance

58
00:03:33,978 --> 00:03:36,645
for this family to get
reading in their lives.

59
00:03:36,681 --> 00:03:38,914
So get on your feet, bubs.

60
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:42,551
We are taking a walk.

61
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:45,021
To the library.

62
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,723
Where you'll have to be quiet.

63
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:51,560
Wait, you're closing?

64
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:53,629
You wanna read?
Start with the sign.

65
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:56,298
Oh, can't we just go
in for five minutes?

66
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:57,666
Up to you.

67
00:03:57,702 --> 00:03:59,835
But after 2:00, the
silverfish take over.

68
00:04:01,872 --> 00:04:03,739
I just wanted to renew my card!

69
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,815
DVDs, plush toys, crullers...

70
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,650
I don't see many books.

71
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:17,386
Yeah, the only actual books
are coffee table books.

72
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:19,088
Barn Doors of Topeka,

73
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:20,522
Dogs Eating Ice Cream,

74
00:04:20,558 --> 00:04:22,725
Jigsaw Puzzles
with One Piece Missing,

75
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,226
Man-Killing Snakes
of the Amazon...

76
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:27,696
Sir! Never say Amazon
in a bookstore.

77
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:29,598
Amazon! Of course!

78
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:31,600
Alexa!

79
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:33,335
Order books!

80
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:34,770
I already did.

81
00:04:34,805 --> 00:04:36,438
Your mind is open to me.

82
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:37,940
They'll be home before I am.

83
00:04:39,977 --> 00:04:41,777
Ma'am, if you really
want to read,

84
00:04:41,812 --> 00:04:43,579
check out our
proprietary e-reader.

85
00:04:43,614 --> 00:04:45,180
The Bookaccino Niche.

86
00:04:45,216 --> 00:04:46,248
Excuse me.

87
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:48,183
That device is poorly
designed.

88
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:49,585
I would register
my disgust,

89
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,654
but it corrects
with auto praise.

90
00:04:57,895 --> 00:05:00,929
Finally, a bookstore
that sells books.

91
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:05,312
- I love the smell of old books.
- Oh, oatmeal.

92
00:05:07,338 --> 00:05:08,370
Wouldn't do that, miss.

93
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:11,284
The air in here has a lot
of particulate rat droppings.

94
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:13,409
Okay.

95
00:05:13,444 --> 00:05:14,710
Let's book up and bug out.

96
00:05:14,745 --> 00:05:16,245
Here you go, Bart.

97
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,658
The Sisterhood of
the Traveling Pants.

98
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:19,581
Maggie, In Cold Blood.

99
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:21,950
Lisa, With No Apologies,
The Memoirs of Barry Goldwater.

100
00:05:24,321 --> 00:05:26,555
Lisa, look!

101
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,259
The Princess in the Garden,
by Heloise Hodgeson Burwell.

102
00:05:31,362 --> 00:05:32,995
It's my very favorite book

103
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,463
from when I was a girl.

104
00:05:34,498 --> 00:05:35,798
It's for ages ten and up,

105
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,099
but I think you're ready.

106
00:05:37,134 --> 00:05:38,667
If you think so.

107
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:44,740
Wait a minute.

108
00:05:44,775 --> 00:05:47,743
One bar... two bars...
five bars.

109
00:05:47,778 --> 00:05:49,311
You're not reading a book.

110
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:51,680
- You're in a Wi-Fi hotspot!
- Dad, please.

111
00:05:51,716 --> 00:05:53,716
I'm trying to reserve
tickets to TunnelCraft-Con.

112
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,519
What?
What the hell is that?

113
00:05:57,555 --> 00:05:59,121
Duh, it's a convention

114
00:05:59,156 --> 00:06:00,522
for kids who play TunnelCraft.

115
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:02,257
It's got skins, betas, mods...

116
00:06:02,293 --> 00:06:04,426
exclusive access
to the top devs.

117
00:06:04,462 --> 00:06:06,595
No convention.
And that's almost final.

118
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,764
But I'm dying to go, fatso.

119
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:11,300
Now it is final!

120
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:14,369
What do you have for a kid

121
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:16,205
who wishes
his father was dead?

122
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,607
Try this. The Art of War,

123
00:06:18,642 --> 00:06:22,010
written 3,000 years ago
by General Sun Tzu.

124
00:06:22,046 --> 00:06:25,347
Well, there's war in the
title and very few pages.

125
00:06:25,382 --> 00:06:27,349
The only flaw is it's a book.

126
00:06:27,384 --> 00:06:31,587
Young man, are you sure you
want war with your father?

127
00:06:35,593 --> 00:06:37,493
I do not seek war,

128
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:39,828
but neither do I turn away.

129
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:44,299
If you use this book,

130
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:49,071
your father will lie shattered
before the gates of your palace.

131
00:06:51,242 --> 00:06:53,242
Oh, mighty general!

132
00:06:53,277 --> 00:06:56,211
I beg to be
your unworthy footstool.

133
00:06:56,247 --> 00:06:58,647
When he sleeps, I will steal
the jewels from his topknot.

134
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,051
Hey, Mom,
I found something to read!

135
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:04,887
Wonderful!

136
00:07:04,922 --> 00:07:06,855
What a great family day.

137
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:09,424
And there is only
one perfect way

138
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,427
to complete a great
family day.

139
00:07:12,463 --> 00:07:13,996
So, how's the family?

140
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:15,936
I think they went to dinner.
Something nice.

141
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:27,559
Nelson's coming our way.

142
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:30,695
My nose is pre-bleeding.

143
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,298
I'm picking on Bart.

144
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,866
You like books, huh?

145
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:37,402
Well, here's a bookmark.

146
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:41,940
If your enemy is easily
enraged, irritate him.

147
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:43,553
I heard you're not
strong, you're just fat.

148
00:07:43,577 --> 00:07:45,209
Fat? Me?

149
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:47,579
You try eating healthy
at a strip club buffet!

150
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:53,384
Willy!

151
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,786
Get me out of here!

152
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:58,590
It's on fire! Willy!

153
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:03,661
Maybe wisdom isn't
so stupid after all.

154
00:08:03,697 --> 00:08:06,598
Milhouse, I'm gonna use this
book to go to TunnelCraft-Con.

155
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,266
Here's the book I'm reading.

156
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:09,801
When I finish this,

157
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:12,670
I'll have read every
Mary Kate and Ashley book.

158
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:15,540
Sometimes I feel like
the third sister.

159
00:08:17,877 --> 00:08:20,144
He opposed the religious right.

160
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,615
Okay, this is my favorite book
ever, but no pressure.

161
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,316
You realize saying
no pressure

162
00:08:25,352 --> 00:08:27,518
puts me under
tremendous pressure.

163
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:30,521
Then let's get started.

164
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:33,024
Not all English girls
grow up in England.

165
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,926
Clara grew up
in South America

166
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:38,029
where she was raised
by many native servants.

167
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:42,000
But they were too naturally
servile to oppose her will.

168
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:43,868
Naturally what?

169
00:08:45,905 --> 00:08:46,971
Uncle Juan?

170
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:50,008
Would you clap as I dance?

171
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:52,377
Rhythm... rhythm...

172
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:55,580
Mind the rhythm
or you'll feel the lash!

173
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:58,883
Mom, why'd you stop reading?

174
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:02,053
It's just a little different
than I remembered.

175
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:03,354
Let's skip ahead.

176
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,491
A father murdered by
loco banana picker,

177
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:09,394
Clara baptizing savages
without their permission...

178
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:11,396
Oh, okay, okay, here we go.

179
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:13,231
Clara is now an orphan

180
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:16,167
and was sent to live with
her lonely uncle in the hills.

181
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:18,036
She meets a boy named Conor.

182
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:21,406
Like all Irish, he was
feeble-witted and drunk.

183
00:09:21,441 --> 00:09:24,842
This is the part
you deem acceptable?

184
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:27,245
The Irish are nobody's
joke anymore.

185
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,247
<i>Hoi-dee toi-dee
toi-dee toi!</i>

186
00:09:29,282 --> 00:09:32,183
I'm goin' on a hunger
strike in here!

187
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:35,386
So weak. So weak...

188
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,390
Another childhood
classic bites the dust.

189
00:09:39,426 --> 00:09:41,159
Is that a coolie hat?

190
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:43,194
Nighty-night!

191
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:47,298
I bet my booklight is shining
on something offensive.

192
00:09:48,935 --> 00:09:50,468
Darn it.

193
00:09:55,442 --> 00:09:57,875
Heloise Hodgeson Burwell?

194
00:09:57,911 --> 00:10:00,111
Why did you stop
reading my book?

195
00:10:00,146 --> 00:10:02,580
Your daughter is just the kind
of girl I wrote it for...

196
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:05,583
Obedient, well-fed and white.

197
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:07,418
Oh, calm yourself, Marge.

198
00:10:07,454 --> 00:10:09,620
Dreams are where it's okay
to be racist.

199
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:11,255
Rudyard Kipling!

200
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,058
Yes. You should read my first
draft of The Jungle Book.

201
00:10:14,094 --> 00:10:16,094
At the end,
Mowgli uses his elephants

202
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:19,864
to stomp out some Hindus
seeking limited voting rights.

203
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:21,899
All in good fun.

204
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:26,104
Marge, I suppose
you could edit my book

205
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:28,106
to your daughter's
sensibilities.

206
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:30,641
An author that wants rewrites.

207
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:33,511
Well, that's what makes
this a dream.

208
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:36,013
Now the war begins.

209
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:37,582
Not yet!

210
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:39,250
I haven't finished my costume.

211
00:10:39,285 --> 00:10:43,621
I'm doing period sewing
with bird bones as needles.

212
00:10:47,861 --> 00:10:49,594
Wait.

213
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:51,295
Why do you want me
to text you

214
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:53,798
when your father's
getting in the car?

215
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:58,269
That's none of your business,
but let's just say

216
00:10:58,304 --> 00:11:00,605
both of us will benefit.

217
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,240
A trombone mute?

218
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:04,142
But I don't have a trombone.

219
00:11:04,177 --> 00:11:06,244
Open the other box.

220
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,678
Oh, my God!

221
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:22,660
All right, Simpson,
blow into this.

222
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:25,163
Now make it into a rabbit.

223
00:11:25,198 --> 00:11:27,632
All right.
Ralphie's birthday is today,

224
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,700
and you're the entertainment.

225
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:34,305
What's going on? It's like
someone's out to get me.

226
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,040
I have to be focused and careful.

227
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:39,177
Nothing will break my concen...
Ooh! Wild milk ball.

228
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:53,791
Bart! You're behind this?

229
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:57,628
That's right. And it looks like
someone is stuck in the mud.

230
00:11:57,664 --> 00:11:59,764
Help me, boy!

231
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:03,334
I will save you if you do
what I say from now on...

232
00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:06,103
starting with going to
TunnelCraft-Con.

233
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:10,007
Sure. Just pull me out
by your sneaky little neck!

234
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:15,746
Just be aware that
if something happens to me,

235
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:18,583
Mom finds out about your
secret stash of Drake's Cakes.

236
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:19,817
What secret stash?

237
00:12:19,853 --> 00:12:23,020
Pier 18, shipping container
number 4-7-9-5-2.

238
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:24,856
D'oh!

239
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:28,025
I was offered a deal and I took it.
Okay, I give.

240
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:29,861
Louder, dog!

241
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:31,429
Okay!

242
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:39,270
You really think
you can control me?

243
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:41,239
Malted milk ball.

244
00:12:54,532 --> 00:12:59,878
Okay. Here's a new version
of The Princess in the Garden.

245
00:13:00,241 --> 00:13:03,054
- Mom, you're exhausted.
- It takes a lot of work

246
00:13:03,055 --> 00:13:05,689
to take the spirit and
character out of a book.

247
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:09,831
But now it's as inoffensive
as a Sunday in Cincinnati.

248
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:12,333
Once there was a cisgender
girl named Clara.

249
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:14,335
She lived in South America,

250
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,470
fighting for wild horse
rescue...

251
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,841
and net neutrality.

252
00:13:22,378 --> 00:13:24,011
This new Clara

253
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:26,347
sounds like she starts
out pretty perfect.

254
00:13:26,382 --> 00:13:27,848
You betcha!

255
00:13:27,884 --> 00:13:29,884
But since she's already evolved,

256
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,853
she doesn't really have an
emotional journey to complete.

257
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:34,706
- Nope.
- Kind of means there's

258
00:13:34,707 --> 00:13:36,389
no point to the book.

259
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,223
Well, what am I supposed
to do?

260
00:13:38,258 --> 00:13:39,758
It's hard to say.

261
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:41,760
Something that started
decades ago

262
00:13:41,795 --> 00:13:43,695
and was applauded
and inoffensive,

263
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,697
is now politically
incorrect.

264
00:13:45,732 --> 00:13:47,399
What can you do?

265
00:13:47,434 --> 00:13:50,402
Some things will be dealt
with at a later date.

266
00:13:50,437 --> 00:13:51,813
If at all.

267
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:54,604
Hey, Simpsons.
We'll see you in church.

268
00:13:54,605 --> 00:13:55,708
Not today you won't.

269
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,209
Well, we'll say
a prayer for you.

270
00:13:57,244 --> 00:13:59,044
Don't mention my name, weirdo.

271
00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:02,781
Dear Lord, forgive that boy.

272
00:14:02,816 --> 00:14:04,950
He knows not what he says.

273
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:08,954
What does that weirdo want now?

274
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:38,450
My feet hurt.
There's too much cosplay,

275
00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:39,918
whatever that is.

276
00:14:39,953 --> 00:14:42,087
- Can we go home?
- Quiet, you.

277
00:14:42,122 --> 00:14:44,656
It's the two greatest
TunnelCraft players of all time!

278
00:14:44,691 --> 00:14:46,558
Those guys make
awesome videos

279
00:14:46,593 --> 00:14:48,693
where they play
TunnelCraft together.

280
00:14:48,729 --> 00:14:50,462
Has the world gone mad?

281
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:53,198
Their banter is legendary.

282
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,266
- Got that?
- Yeah.

283
00:14:54,301 --> 00:14:55,301
- Go left.
- Right.

284
00:14:55,335 --> 00:14:57,102
- Left. Go right.
- Right.

285
00:14:57,137 --> 00:14:58,103
- Dig.
- Dig.

286
00:14:58,138 --> 00:14:59,104
Dig.

287
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:00,305
- Dig.
- Cool.

288
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,806
That's why they call me
Tunnel-Rat.

289
00:15:01,842 --> 00:15:03,441
- I'm Tunnel-Rat.
- Oh, right.

290
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:05,343
Oh, awesome!

291
00:15:07,414 --> 00:15:09,281
- What the...?
- Calm down.

292
00:15:09,316 --> 00:15:11,149
It's me, Daniel Radcliffe.

293
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:13,618
This is how I see
conventions, incognito.

294
00:15:13,654 --> 00:15:15,620
Otherwise the fans envelope me.

295
00:15:15,656 --> 00:15:17,222
Oh, that's ridiculous!

296
00:15:17,257 --> 00:15:18,623
Daniel Radcliffe!

297
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:20,292
He knows Rupert Grint!

298
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:21,593
Yes, I do. He's lovely.

299
00:15:21,628 --> 00:15:23,995
Oh! Oh, God!
What are you...

300
00:15:24,998 --> 00:15:26,531
I loved him.

301
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:28,133
Please, can we go now?

302
00:15:28,168 --> 00:15:30,101
No! You wait in
the poster-signing line.

303
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,103
And don't sign them
yourself.

304
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,972
I'll know.

305
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:36,508
Milhouse, by God,

306
00:15:36,543 --> 00:15:40,445
if you want a ride home,
you tell me what Bart's up to.

307
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,247
Okay. Bart's been using

308
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:44,449
an ancient Chinese book
against you.

309
00:15:44,484 --> 00:15:47,252
I knew it. Except for the
ancient Chinese book part,

310
00:15:47,287 --> 00:15:48,520
I knew it!

311
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:55,827
Why are you bringing
me here?

312
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:58,163
These professors have some
very interesting news for you

313
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:00,031
about Heloise
Hodgeson Burwell.

314
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:02,100
Meanwhile, I'll sit
on this chair

315
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:04,169
and imagine
I'm grading papers.

316
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:08,473
Marge Simpson,
the fan of Burwell.

317
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:10,542
We are all Burwelleans.

318
00:16:10,577 --> 00:16:13,178
You don't mind that her
books are a little...

319
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:15,046
grandma on the veranda?

320
00:16:15,082 --> 00:16:19,150
Marge, Burwell's whole life was
a protest against conformity.

321
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,653
- Yeah, she never married.
- Had no children.

322
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:24,356
She lived in Provincetown,
Mass...

323
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:26,625
a-chu-setts.

324
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,961
Heloise Burwell
is a lesbian icon!

325
00:16:29,997 --> 00:16:32,030
Her offensive stereotypes

326
00:16:32,065 --> 00:16:35,300
were actually a self-consciously
ironic protest

327
00:16:35,335 --> 00:16:37,402
against her own oppression.

328
00:16:37,437 --> 00:16:40,105
How much of that
do you actually believe?

329
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,940
Most.

330
00:16:41,975 --> 00:16:43,508
So much to take in.

331
00:16:43,543 --> 00:16:45,610
How do you deal with it all?

332
00:16:45,646 --> 00:16:47,479
With the help of Sherry.

333
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:50,682
Yes. Sherry, bring in
the hard liquor, please.

334
00:16:54,588 --> 00:16:57,522
Okay. Now you can ask me
about Lewis Carroll.

335
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:06,264
Remember,
all warfare is deception.

336
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,666
Shut up.

337
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:10,035
I'm trying to fool my kid.

338
00:17:12,606 --> 00:17:16,574
Bart, son, if you don't mind,
I brought a friend over.

339
00:17:17,844 --> 00:17:18,877
Flanders?!

340
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,679
Great to be here, pal-o-mino.

341
00:17:20,714 --> 00:17:22,414
I brought some potent grass

342
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:24,582
that'll get this party started.
Bluegrass!

343
00:17:24,618 --> 00:17:27,452
<i>Chicken's in the henhouse,
pig is in the poke</i>

344
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:29,554
<i>The whole dang farm
feels okily-doke</i>

345
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:31,601
<i>Goin' up to Cripple Creek,
swimmin' fully dressed</i>

346
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,326
<i>Not being naked,
oh, that's the best</i>

347
00:17:35,696 --> 00:17:38,330
Mr. Flanders. Again?

348
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:39,597
No siree, Bart!

349
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:41,232
It's me, your Homereeno!

350
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,600
Morning, friend-till-the-end.

351
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:45,136
Ready to greet the day
with a big ho-hey?

352
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:48,773
Call me the Pillsbury Doughboy,
'cause I'm ready to roll!

353
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:50,375
Then let's hi-diddley-go!

354
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:53,211
If anyone can do it,
it's we two-it!

355
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:55,566
- Yes, indeedle, doddily...
- Okily-dokily, dokily, dokily.

356
00:17:58,585 --> 00:18:01,786
Oh, my God.
He's even gone left-handed.

357
00:18:03,323 --> 00:18:05,790
Now we're gonna take you
to a movie rated R

358
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:07,792
for really old and boring.

359
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:34,252
Oh, no, he daren't!

360
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:38,590
Dad, please, isn't there any
way to get the old Homer back?

361
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,493
Well, now, Bartly, why would
you want that balding boob...

362
00:18:41,528 --> 00:18:43,328
Ooh, I said boob!

363
00:18:43,363 --> 00:18:45,163
Time for me to do a turtle.

364
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:47,332
I'll come out when the
B-bombs stop flying.

365
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:49,801
Please, I want my dad,
not this horrible creature

366
00:18:49,836 --> 00:18:52,003
from the depths of heaven
you've become.

367
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:53,705
If you truly surrender,

368
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,174
give me your Halloween candy.

369
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:57,675
But it's March.

370
00:18:57,711 --> 00:18:59,611
Most of it's still good.

371
00:18:59,646 --> 00:19:00,779
Fine.

372
00:19:00,814 --> 00:19:02,647
Now, bow to your master,

373
00:19:02,682 --> 00:19:04,716
because you are the fool,

374
00:19:04,751 --> 00:19:07,852
and I, the greater fool!

375
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:10,021
Dad! You read the book too?

376
00:19:10,056 --> 00:19:12,290
Up to page five.

377
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:15,360
Now, come here, son,
and grab some belly.

378
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:19,731
Excuse me. These films
are original nitrate prints.

379
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:23,334
Which means the theater has
just gone up in a terrible fire.

380
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,903
You have seconds to escape!

381
00:19:27,908 --> 00:19:30,705
They never tell the organist.

382
00:19:49,065 --> 00:19:51,866
So that film is
a hundred years old?

383
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:54,969
No. We shot it
at my place yesterday.

384
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:02,243
<i>Well, now it's time to say good-bye</i>

385
00:20:02,278 --> 00:20:03,944
<i>To Ned and Rod and Todd</i>

386
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,681
<i>And I'll remind all you folks
you should be praisin' God</i>

387
00:20:07,717 --> 00:20:10,851
<i>If you don't, you'll rot
in hell for all eternity</i>

388
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:15,256
<i>It's all a part of God's great
love he has for you and me</i>

389
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,893
Y'all come back, now.
Y'hear?
