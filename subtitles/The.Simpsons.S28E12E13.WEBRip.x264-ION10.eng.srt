00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,188
{\an8}Oh, fine.
You can fetch the ice.

47
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,110
{\an8}Okay. How many bags?

48
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,359
{\an8}Oh, no. None of those

{\an8}Now, you head up
to Northern Canada

50
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,357
{\an8}and get me a quarter ton
of lake ice.

51

{\an8}Hand-sawn and tong-carried.

52

{\an8}Risk my life

53
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,447
{\an8}just to bring you some ice.

54
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,196
{\an8}It would be an honor.

55
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,827
{\an8}Would you like it packed in
cedar sawdust or Spanish oak?

56
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,875
{\an8}Oh, who cares?
Ice is ice.

57
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,289

{\an8}Mmm.

62
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,467
{\an8}Simpson, you seem fairly popular,

63
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,266
{\an8}at least based on the cheers you
got at employee karaoke night.

64
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,150
{\an8}It's not me, it's "Mustang Sally."

65

Mr. Burns is throwing
a little party,

66
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,153
and most of his invitees
are either dead or fictional.

67
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,403
Uh, to, uh, well,
fill out the crowd,

68
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,565
uh, perhaps you could, uh,
distribute these invitations

69
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,914
to your more, uh,
presentable friends.

70
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,530
I know just who to invite.

71
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,237
-You're not invited.
-To what?

72
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,247
None of your business!

73
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,870
All right.

74
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,877
MARGE:
"Your esteemed presence is requested

75
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,419

madcap magic and mischief

76
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,263
at Monty Burns'
Middle Hampton estate."

00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,219

78
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,221
Bart, get in here
and feel this stock.

79
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,814
Oh, man, that's heavy.

80
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,390
The Springfield Hamptons?

81
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,104
That's on Lengthy Island,

82
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,645
where rich people hang out
on summer weekends.

83
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:12,029
{\an8}I know all about it from
cartoons in literary magazines.

HOMER:
I'm not reading all that.

85
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,782
Well, now to select
the perfect guest list

86
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,583
of our city's sharpest wits
and glittering socialites.

87
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,658
(car alarms blaring,
Homer whistling)

88
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,960
Boy, oh, boy, a '20s shindig
at Old Man Burnsie's.

89
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,795
Probably gonna be
bathtubs full of shrimp

90
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,760
and Jacuzzis full of brisket.

91
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,180
Maybe I'll meet a rich bachelor
who will sweep me off my feet.

92
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,800
-How do I smell?
-(sniffs)

93
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,927
Like a wood fire put out
by dumping coffee on it.

94
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,765
Oh! Perfect.

95
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,060
Hey, everyone, hey!

96
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,813
I'm off-duty, so please

97
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,105
don't feel weird doing drugs
in front of me.

98
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,819
Uh, or with me.
(chuckles)

99
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,819
I became a cop too young.

100
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,401
I never lived.

101
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,276
I didn't live.

102
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,623
<i>HOMER:</i>

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,590
I don't see any magic.

109
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,508

Nothing in a blanket?

113

{\an8}Dad, did Mr. Burns cheap out?

114
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,273
That's impossible.

115
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,435
He's the richest man in town.

116
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,534
If I had known
this was a cash bar,

117
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,609
I would've gotten
wasted beforehand!

118
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,356

120
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,367
Welcome, honored guests.

121
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,662
Leave your inhibitions at the door.

122
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,326
And write your name
on your drink cup,

123
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,705
you will not receive a second.

(muttering)

125
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,957
Now, dance the night away on
my vintage 1920s parquet floor.

126
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,467
The cleaning of which
is not cheap,

127
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,969
{\an8}so be sure to don
your protective booties.

(Moe grunting)

129
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,179
Look, Mr. Burns, nobody loves a
party with rules more than I do.

130
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,648
Even I'm baffled by
the toilet payment system.

131
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,359
Oh, it's simple, bring the chit

132
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,569
from the applicable restroom
to the purser...

133
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,359
You might've been fun
100 years ago, Burnsie,

134
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,154
but now you're a cheap,
old lamewad.

135
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,907
And trust me,
I know cheap.

136
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,740
That's right,
I bought a suit,

137
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,825
Xeroxed it, returned it,
and wore the copy.

138
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,541
-(grunts)
-(guests groaning)

139
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,211
-Waste of my time.
-Why is everyone leaving?

140
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,081
Of course, no ice.

141
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,048
Mm, that lazy Smithers is probably

142
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,008
sipping hot buttered rum
in a ski chalet

143
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,718

144

146
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,467
Ah.

147
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,726
Uh-oh.

148
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,558
Aw.

149
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,313

(crying)

152
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,775
Hey, Mr. Burns, fun party.

153
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,532
No one felt any pressure
to talk or laugh

154
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,405
or stay past 7:30.

155
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,992
-Super chill.
-Oh, hush.

156
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,868
I'm a worn-out old miser who's
forgotten the meaning of fun.

157
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,286
(gasps)

158
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,245
Great Gatsby!

159
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,835
What is that?

160
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,880
(music and chatter in distance)

161
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,303
Someone else is having
a party across the bay.

162
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,133
(chuckles)
Once I would've thought nothing

163
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,548
of rowing across the water
and crashing that party.

164
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,967
All doors would open
for Monogram Monty.

165
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,016
That was a long time ago.

166
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,480
Aw, I'll row you over.

167
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,111
How hard could it be?

168
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,018
(Homer gasping for air)

169
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,267
Oh, so hard.

170
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,688
Would it help if I whipped you?

171
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,986
Maybe.

172
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,609
Yeah, a little.

173
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,275

Mr. Burns and I were just leaving.

Are you Montgomery Burns,
the despised billionaire?

Well, that's what my cufflinks say.

I can't believe I'm meeting
the Monty Burns.

211

How do you know me?

212
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,421
You're the dude who wrote
<i>The Rungs of Ruthlessness.</i>

213
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,251
(chuckles) Yes, back then
they'd give a book contract

214
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,667
to any CEO with a power tie
and a bonsai tree.

215
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,377
When I was a boy,
I found a copy

216
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,257
left on the seat of a bus I stole.

217
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,934
And after I read it, I knew I'd
jacked my last courtesy shuttle.

218
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,354
Your book became my bible.

219
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,023
"Every empire needs an emblem."
See?

220
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,692
There you told me
to find a symbol

221
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,271
to represent my brand.

222
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,896
And there he is,

223
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,692
the living logo of
Golden Goose Records,

224
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,947
-Goosius.
-(honks)

225
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,239
You make me believe I can fly.

226
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,124
Goosius is on everything

227
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,951
from my cognac-flavored vodka

228
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,616
to the brake pads
I coproduced with Lil Wayne.

229
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,791
Aw, he eats the same way I do,

230
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,547
without swallowing.

231
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,759
You've flown south for
the winter with my heart.

-Ow!

233
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,045

I never dreamed

Mats Wilander may have been
a decent player,

277

278
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,396

Pardon me a second.

280
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,701
What is it,
head points, what?

281
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:02,243
Just because your father has
money doesn't mean you can cut.

282
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,748
Hmm, it kind of
looks like it does.

283
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,420
All right, I'll tell you what--
because I am a nice guy,

284
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,210
I am going to pay
for everyone's cones.

285
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,674
Is that okay?
Does that make it okay?

286
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:13,875
-Yeah!
-Yes!

287
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:14,924

288
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,677

-The Forstmans' firefly thing?
-No.

297
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,113
The Olins' jellyfish fry thing?

298
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,573
I'm not going to any things at all!

299
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,914
But I want to, um, hang out.

300
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,490
What? Why?

301
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,575
I've never met anyone
like you before.

302
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,871
Anyone with, you know,
I don't know, um,

303
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,245
morals.

304
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,621
Oh. (giggles)

305
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,338
Well, I guess it is
a little judgy of me

306
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,999
to be completely
disgusted by you.

307
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,628
Great, I'll set something up.
Erin, are you on?

308
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,426
Okay, I need to bail on
the Kravises' freeze tag thing.

309
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,050
No, I know, I have to.

310
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,637
Send the big basket.

311
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,182
What's wrong, honey?

312
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,845
Lisa's got a rich boyfriend,

313
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,143
Dad's hanging out with
a hip-hop super producer,

314
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,597
and I'm stuck window-shopping

315
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,437
with you two fun-sucking
stink buckets.

316
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,863
It's not fair!

317
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,481
Life's not fair, kid.

318
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,898
Do I know you?

319
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,066
If life was fair,
you would know me.

320
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,565
But know this--
Jay G ain't all that.

321
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,487
-What do you mean?
-Buy a candle and I'll tell you.

322
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,287
-What's your cheapest one?
-$55.

323
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:30,671
No way. I could start a fire
in the woods for nothing.

324
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,670
<i>HOMER: So Bart met someone</i>
<i>who I think comes back later.</i>

325
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,423
<i>I forget why.</i>

326
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,514
Hmm. Who would have thought
two billionaire Republicans

327
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,181
from such different backgrounds
could end up as chums?

328
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,350
Is not green a more powerful
color than black or white?

329
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,350
The Lord picks a select few
to accumulate more money

330
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,683
than anyone else.

331
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,098
You and I bear that
sacred avarice.

332
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,187
Each of my enterprises
has its own G6.

333
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,073
What's that one?

334
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,860
That's for my... (chuckles)

335
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,783

336
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,492
(chuckling)
You know what I'm sayin'?

337
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,872
I don't.

338
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,632
You seem to get so much joy
out of your money.

339
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:16,841
I envy you.

340
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,301
You've given me so much, Monty.

341
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:23,141
Let me give you something back--
the freedom to live large.

342
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,012
A charge plate?

343
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,097
I've never had one of those
newfangled swipe-a-ma-jigs.

344
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:33,234
It's an Obsidian Card,
the most exclusive.

345
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,902
No spending limit,
no store has ever heard of it.

346
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,071
But they have to accept it.

347
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,440
Take it if you want
to roll like G.

348
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,197
-Don't forget to sign it.

No, no, not a felt-tip.
Oh! It'll smudge.

Okay, quick,

Blake, I have to say,

353
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,130
this whale watch was
a very thoughtful idea.

354
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,586
(gasps)
Oh, it's a whole family.

355
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,638
But they're so far away.

356
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,271
Far? Babe, when you
whale watch with me,

357
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,929
you sit pod-side.

358
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,307

What can we do here?

359
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,110
This way, the whales know
we are VIPs.

360
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,781
Um, where's the baby?

361
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,150
There's supposed to be a baby.

362
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,606
I paid for a calf.

363
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,776

Well, if we went on
some lame econo-watch,

367
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,622
we might not see blowhole one.

368
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,248
I mean, what are you saying?
Are you hearing yourself?

369
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,705

you could change.

370
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,586

If these rhymes
are to be believed,

521
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,843
Jay lured me into debt
and now he owns everything.

522
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,803
Even my beloved nuclear plant.

<i>The loneliest moment in someone's life</i>

525

542

My eyes were clouded
by the cataracts of excess.

543
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,812
And by an excess of cataracts.

544
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,857
Wait.
What happened to my posse?

545
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:01,651
Don't you worry.
A posse's loyalty is forever.

546
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,407
Hey, Burnsie, I didn't get
any brand-new sneakers today.

547
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,159
{\an8}I can't be wearing

555
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,762
Huh! Preposterous.
I raised those hounds from pups.

556
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,595
I'm the only master
they've ever known.

557
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,720
One word from me

Sign this release legally
releasing the hounds.

562
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,359
If you don't, Mr. Jay G
will release the hounds.

563
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,332
Jay, I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

564
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:54,041
We were going to open up
a money-losing winery together.

565
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,922

570
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,600

taken from me.

and a store to support.

00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,717

00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,477
Be gone, urchin.
We have work to do.

692
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,139
Wait, wait! He can help.

693
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,768
No one's better at
nasty schemes than this kid.

694
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,815
I mean, he's messed up.

695
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:16,439
Look at him. You got to figure
his family life's a disaster.

696
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,408
Why should I help Burns
now that he's broke?

697
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,408
I've got more money
than he does.

698
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,740
Would the cape and gloves

699
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,906
of the infamous
Gaslight Strangler

700
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,504
change your mind?

701
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,040
If you want to take down
a rapper, you got to destroy

702
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,415
the thing that's most important
to him-- his rep.

703
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,843
(whispering)
Rep means reputation.

704
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,683
To do that, we got to go
to the ultimate expert

705
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,339
on urban culture.

706
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,098
<i>A white nerd.</i>

707
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,389
So, in South Central
Springfield in the '90s,

708
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,603
there were four major
hip-hop sub-scenes.

709
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,104
The Good Time Mafia,
Licorice Avenue,

710
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,686
The Dirty, Dirty North,
and The FLTA.

711
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,522
The Fine Ladies Thug Army.

712
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,357
Fascinating.

713
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,531
Yes, yes, but do you have
anything we can use

714
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:02,122
against my sworn enemy, Jay G?

715
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:05,028
Before he was Jay G,
he was Jeremy Gilroy,

716
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,368
a founding member
of The Five Boyfriends,

717
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,084
a soulful R&B quintet.

718
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,714
Hey, I know this guy.

719
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,540
He tried to sell me a $55 candle!

720
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,626
That's Jazzy James,
the Lyrical Miracle.

721
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,343
He wrote all of
Jay's early hits.

722
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,093
But they had a falling out,

723
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,215
and he was never heard from again.

724
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,552
Then only one man can write the rap

725
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:27,387
that will ruin the rep of Jay G.

726
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,064
Jazzy James.

727
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,232
<i>HOMER:</i>
<i>I told you this guy would come back.</i>

728
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,521
<i>Told you.</i>

729
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,324
Yeah, I used to be Jazzy James.

730
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,148
The Lyrical Miracle?

731
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,073
My skills were empirical.

732
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,822
I wrote all the rhymes for
Jay G's first hip-hop record.

733
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:46,576
I didn't get a dime, because
I signed over all the rights.

734
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,749
-Why'd you do that?
-(groans)

735
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,248
All right, all right.
I'll sign!

736
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,920
He took my money,
stole my girl,

737
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:59,842
made me get a tattoo of
the baseball from <i>Major League.</i>

738
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:03,093
It broke me. I fell hard,
into scented candles.

739
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,716
(inhales deeply)

740
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,763
(exhales) Quince.

741
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,386
Listen, Jazzy.
We're gonna tear down Jay G

742
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,934
with the ultimate revenge rap.

743
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,937
And you're gonna write it.

744
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,979
-Oh... (grunts)
-(glass shatters)

745
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,193
I'm in.

746
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,572
Excellent.

747
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,359
-What is... rap?
-Hmm?

748
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,693
Hmm.

749
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,528
Quick, boy! Hide this thing.

750
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:24,863
(Bart grunting)

751
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:30,696
Homie, it's so sweet of you
to come visit me at my store.

752
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,707
But aren't you gonna get in
trouble for missing work?

753
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,380
You let me worry
about the nuclear plant.

754
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,129
The important thing
for you to do

755
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,591
is believe I still work there.

756
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,802
I can't wait to show you
the changes I've made.

757
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:46,433
We're getting a lot of foot traffic.

758
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,851
Three people used
the bathroom yesterday.

759
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,850
{\an8}How much should I charge
for these handbags

760
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,602
{\an8}made from the speaker covers
of old jukeboxes?

761
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,055
Five dollars.
No, no, no, no, no.

762
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,185
A hundred dollars!
(gasps)

763
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,653
It's happening. It's happening.

764
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,323
I love my store!

765
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:06,533
We're putting up new wallpaper.

766
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,874
(grunting)

767
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,200
Is Mom gonna be okay?

768
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:14,246
I don't know, son,
I don't know.

769
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,830
MAN:
Oh, it's not her, fellas.

770
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:18,415
It's the curse of
the adorable little store.

771
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,801
Didn't always used to be like this.
No, no.

772
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,299
Once, this land was
full of actual stores,

773
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,221
as far as the eye could see.

774
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,050
Then the rich people came.

775
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,925
They didn't need to make money,

776
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,262
they just needed a place for
their friends to wander into,

777
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,887
after spin class.

778
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,564
Yeah, that's progress for you.

779
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,392

No offense, worms.

868

871
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,483

Sorry to crash your party
as a hologram, M.B.,

875
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,695
but I'm having a little
celebration of my own.

876
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,413
I just bought
the master recording

877

881
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,838

883
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,256

-Oh, it's okay, Homie.
-You're not mad?

Your heart told you
to stick with Mr. Burns,

922
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,594
and the thing I love
about you most

923
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:03,716
is you've got a heart
as big as The Ritz.

924
