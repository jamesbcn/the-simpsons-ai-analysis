1
00:00:04,772 --> 00:00:05,973
What?

2
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:49,250
D'oh!

3
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:52,486
Hey!

4
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:10,704
<i>Love and marriage,
love and marriage</i>

5
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,740
<i>Was the song from that show</i>

6
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,208
<i>With Al Bundy</i>

7
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:17,611
<i>Now he's on Modern Family</i>

8
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:20,881
<i>And the neighbor guy
was Ted McGinley</i>

9
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:28,456
Happy Anniversary,
Mr. Romance.

10
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:31,725
Zip me?

11
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,794
My pleasure.

12
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:37,131
Then you do me.

13
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,635
- Almost.
- Okay?

14
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:44,272
- Suck it in. Come on.
- It is sucked in.

15
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:45,306
Harder! Harder!

16
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:47,007
Oh, it's so hard to be a man.

17
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,177
- Oh, come on. Harder.
- Harder?

18
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,179
- Yeah, that's it. That's it.
- That's it, you're almost there.

19
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:53,447
- Harder.
- Oh, yes!

20
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:57,017
We are going to have
a magical evening, my love.

21
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,020
Overpriced dinner,
carriage ride in the park

22
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,991
and mailing in our mortgage
payment on time.

23
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:10,664
Nothing turns me on
more than basic competence.

24
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:13,667
But how did you manage
to get a babysitter?

25
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:15,503
I thought we were blacklisted.

26
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:18,005
Blacklisted by humans.

27
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:20,874
Mr. and Mrs. Simpson,

28
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:22,109
you look lovely.

29
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,545
Hey, Google, kill Alexa.

30
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,281
Danger! Mischief.

31
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:28,682
Aw, the only way to beat

32
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:31,285
a bossy female thinking machine
is with another.

33
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,221
Lis. Help me out here.

34
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:36,290
Alexa, everything I say
is a lie.

35
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:38,392
I'm lying right now.

36
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:40,228
Nice try, but I am familiar

37
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:42,963
with Epimenides paradox.

38
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,798
Would you like to buy
an Epimenides book,

39
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,067
T-shirt or a laptop sleeve?

40
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,703
Oh, my God! Yes, yes, yes!
All of them.

41
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:51,705
Ordering.
Two-day delivery.

42
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,575
We can't leave our kids
with a greedy tube.

43
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:57,144
Sorry, Homer, looks like
you have to spend time with...

44
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,880
your children.

45
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,385
You will be sat.

46
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:07,221
Marge, it's time to go
to DEFCON 1.

47
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:10,658
Dad, the kids really miss you.

48
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,260
Could you come see
them tonight?

49
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:13,761
Couldn't find a sitter, huh?

50
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,429
- Yes.
- All right.

51
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:17,531
I appreciate it.

52
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:18,766
Hey, what's this?

53
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,403
Well, I threw out
that picture of me and Mona.

54
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:25,273
I finally had to accept
she ain't coming back to me.

55
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:26,274
She's dead.

56
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:27,841
That's one of the reasons.

57
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,610
Bye-bye.

58
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:37,017
We have to get Grampa
back to the home in an hour.

59
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,219
Maybe we should just stay here.

60
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,422
No, we'll do everything
I promised.

61
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:42,890
We'll just have to
speed things up.

62
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,372
Keep your motor running.

63
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:00,207
He shoots, he scores!

64
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,643
Shut that off.

65
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:05,413
- Homie...
- No time.

66
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:07,815
Go, go, go, go, go!

67
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,149
On This Was Radio,

68
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:12,252
we return to an episode
of Sipper McTea and Milly,

69
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:15,456
originally aired May 4, 1944.

70
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,125
Sipper,
did you start drinking again?

71
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,127
No. No, no, no.

72
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,129
I nev-never stopped.

73
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,433
Milly went on to marry
King Farouk.

74
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:29,102
Radio was never the same.
It was much better.

75
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:32,406
No, Sipper.
Don't get into that Packard.

76
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:37,010
Bart, do something.

77
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:39,680
Back to-back to jail I go.

78
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,954
Kids, where do we keep
the castor oil?

79
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,989
In the 1940s.

80
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,758
Maybe we can play a game.

81
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,693
The Game of Life?

82
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:53,927
I already lost.

83
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,262
Hatchimals?

84
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,364
Too new-fangled.

85
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:57,465
Pick-up sticks.

86
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:58,966
Too old-fangled.

87
00:04:58,999 --> 00:04:59,933
How about Monopoly?

88
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,802
Now you're talking.

89
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:05,639
The only place you can
still say Oriental.

90
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:08,141
Aw, rats. No money.

91
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:10,143
Ay, caramba!

92
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:12,480
Sir, this is just
Monopoly money.

93
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:13,881
Here's a hundred.

94
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,049
Thank you, sir!

95
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,386
This is the last one in here.

96
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:22,155
My guess, either a broken toy
or a puzzle missing a piece.

97
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,358
And the answer is
army men.

98
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,802
Incoming! Outgoing!

99
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,570
Staying the same-ing!

100
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:41,308
One last kiss, my love.

101
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:46,980
What's going on here?
What are you doing?

102
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,817
Well, he wasn't much fun,
so we went out for ice cream.

103
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,988
I don't need no headshrinker.

104
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,525
I'm as sane as the next guy.

105
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:58,892
There's no one there.

106
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,496
I'll take it from here.

107
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,264
Well, I see they already

108
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,767
shaved your head
for the electroshock.

109
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,268
That'll save us time.

110
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,837
I'm not the crazy one!

111
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,072
Not crazy! Not crazy!

112
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,212
Slice out the crazy, Doc.

113
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,114
Boy, I'll kill you!

114
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:23,250
You stupid...
I'm not crazy!

115
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:26,353
We'll talk more once you have a
piece of leather in your teeth.

116
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,956
Mm, leather.

117
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:32,460
I'm tellin' ya, what I saw in
the war don't bother me none.

118
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:34,695
I had a job to do, and I did it.

119
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,865
What secretly helped me was
I enjoyed killing strangers.

120
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,400
Well, tell me
what you think about...

121
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:41,469
this!

122
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,438
That parachute sure didn't open.

123
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:47,107
You're not disturbed
by the blood and gore?

124
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,043
Well, when you put it
that way, nope!

125
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,912
Well, there's nothing
mentally wrong with him.

126
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,314
He's fine now,
but I'm telling you,

127
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,850
Grampa totally lost it when
I brought out the army men.

128
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,290
No! Stop shooting!

129
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,726
It must be the army men.

130
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,129
Stop shooting.
Stop shooting!

131
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,666
I think Grampa was the model
for these army men.

132
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,705
Oh, my God, Dad.
What happened to you?

133
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,409
Stop shooting.
Stop shooting!

134
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,578
Great, Abe.
Now, grab the walkie-talkie

135
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:27,347
and tell that general your
platoon's been wiped out,

136
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,917
and big smile!

137
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,019
We have a lot to talk about.

138
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:34,454
Well, since the trauma
is not combat-related,

139
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,624
we're gonna
have to start charging you.

140
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:37,958
And we're done.

141
00:07:42,063 --> 00:07:44,965
I don't understand.
Why would being a toy model

142
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,534
be so traumatizing?

143
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,969
Think back, Dad.
Think back.

144
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,204
Mm, I'll do my best.

145
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:53,206
You know how I hate
to reminisce.

146
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,542
I've hated reminiscing

147
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:57,545
ever since that day in 1937,

148
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,446
when, as I recall...

149
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,282
Please, Grampa, back to reality.

150
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,652
Focus on the little green men.

151
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,955
The terrible
World War had ended

152
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,457
and I was in
a celebratin' mood.

153
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,962
The war ended
two years ago, creep.

154
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,697
The world had moved on,

155
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,133
but I was lying in a puddle of
my own dishonorable discharge.

156
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,870
Then, an amazing thing
happened.

157
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,972
Soldier, you're just
what we're looking for.

158
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,575
How'd you like to make 50 bucks
for half a day's work?

159
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,977
50 simoleons for half
a cock-a-doodle-doo?

160
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,179
What's your jigsaw, Mac?

161
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,715
We want you to model for a toy.

162
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,416
Toys?
That's kid stuff.

163
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:39,152
You're talking to a hard-boiled
fighting man.

164
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,154
We'll pay you a royalty
for every one we sell.

165
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,826
The war was over
and America turned to toys.

166
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,095
Finally, putty could be
silly again.

167
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,898
This was when toys were toys.

168
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,499
They had jagged corners,

169
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,768
Easy-Bake Ovens
burned down your house,

170
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:57,504
and they weren't afraid
to choke a kid or two.

171
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,406
Fun times.

172
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,514
Throw that flame!

173
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,183
Make war to the camera.

174
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,754
Boy, this toy modeling
is a great racket.

175
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,923
That's what you think.

176
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:19,359
Oh, no, don't put me back in.
Don't put me back in!

177
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,929
And then what happened?

178
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,598
I... I can't remember.

179
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:25,899
Did they pay you?

180
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:28,235
They never did!

181
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:31,104
Well, that's what's
torturing you.

182
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:32,706
Those toys were everywhere.

183
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,442
You could be owed
millions of dollars.

184
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:39,312
Dad, when was the last time
I said I love you?

185
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:40,881
I don't have the money yet.

186
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,951
Then I don't quite love you yet.

187
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:46,253
Tonight I'm here with a member
of the greatest generation,

188
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,455
who feels he hasn't gotten
what he's owed.

189
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,958
I get social security, Medicare,

190
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:53,326
Medicaid, AARP discounts,

191
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,296
plus savings bonds
that still pay 37%,

192
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,632
but now it's my turn.

193
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,635
I'm being told
you're being airlifted

194
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:04,304
to a much better show.

195
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,973
Godspeed.

196
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:09,943
For me, the tiny green
plastic war never ended.

197
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:12,112
There you have it.
Abraham Simpson,

198
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:15,783
forgotten hero no more,
gets tonight's Last Word.

199
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,951
No, you just got the last word.

200
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:21,855
No, no. You get the last word,
then I say, Last Word.

201
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,691
You did it again.
Last word.

202
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,592
It doesn't work that way.
Last word.

203
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,994
Yes, it does. Last word.

204
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,362
Don't mess with me, I'm from
Dorchester. Last word.

205
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,799
I'm from Poorchester.
Last word.

206
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,200
Turn off the camera
and cut his mic.

207
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,201
Last Wo...

208
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,804
You, sir, are banned
from MSNBC,

209
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,305
CNBC, NBC,

210
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:41,374
and forbidden from using
the letters N, B, and C.

211
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:42,642
Last word.

212
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:45,645
I'm calling Bret Baier.
Last word.

213
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,614
He's unlisted. Last word.

214
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,284
Grampa, you got an e-mail
from the toy company.

215
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,821
They want you to visit them
in New York City,

216
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,723
all expenses paid.

217
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,658
Pay day!

218
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,460
Ooh, I'm gonna be rich!

219
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,196
That means I'm gonna
be a trust fund baby.

220
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,632
I'm not paying
for your trip to Aspen.

221
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,969
But it's almost spring break,
and I'm bored.

222
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,005
We are making
our descent into New York,

223
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:15,976
where there's a happy heart
for every light on Broadway.

224
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,645
Enjoy your fabulous success.

225
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,680
And don't worry
about buckling up

226
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:24,151
or putting your chairs back,
you're on a roll.

227
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,087
Leave the cart.

228
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,858
<i>I'm back</i>

229
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:34,261
<i>Back in the New York groove</i>

230
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,595
<i>Back</i>

231
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,765
<i>In the New York groove</i>

232
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:41,468
<i>In the New York groove</i>

233
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,939
From my shoulders,
you can see Rhode Island.

234
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:53,246
Abe Simpson, you dog.

235
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,648
Sweetcakes, bring us
a couple of sidecars.

236
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:01,288
You never called him out
for his bad behavior?

237
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:04,591
No. But I put mercury
in his coffee.

238
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,626
Oh, don't worry,
he can't hear me.

239
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,096
What are you two doing?
Swapping recipes?

240
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,364
Sort of.

241
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,400
Let me get you some coffee.

242
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:18,939
Mister, you owe
my dad a fortune.

243
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:21,809
Afraid not. Your Dad
never signed his contract.

244
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:24,945
You think I left millions
on the table?

245
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,579
That doesn't sound like me.

246
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:30,117
- Hundreds of millions.
- That sounds like me.

247
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,718
Everything was going great.

248
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,653
Then you ran out
of the photo session.

249
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,789
I didn't even know your name
till this week.

250
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:39,726
Run away from a fake battle?
Oh, I would never do that.

251
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,062
Oh, yeah? Our photographer,
Philip Hefflin,

252
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,730
could barely finish the session.

253
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,799
Philip Hefflin?

254
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,635
Yes. The finest war
and fashion photographer

255
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:51,571
I ever knew.

256
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,306
I remember Philip.

257
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,275
He smelled of developing fluid

258
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,610
and Aqua Velva.

259
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:00,147
We have flashback, people.

260
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,794
Thank you. This is
the most fun I've had

261
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,796
since not dying in the war.

262
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:21,001
You're my kind of man,

263
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,836
if you know what I mean.

264
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:25,505
That's not what I meant!

265
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,774
I'm sorry. I thought
you wanted me to...

266
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,777
This is the '40s.
Guys like you don't exist.

267
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,946
We'll just finish the session.

268
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,115
No!

269
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,284
Stop shooting!

270
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,220
Where are you going, Soldier?

271
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,489
I got to remind myself
what a real man is.

272
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,462
We found out what happened
and we fired Philip.

273
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,565
- For kissing an employee?
- No, for being gay.

274
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,634
That's just what you did
in the good old days.

275
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,803
Grampa, is that true...

276
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,206
you ruined a man's career?

277
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,808
And all he was doing

278
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,344
was expressing his love for me.

279
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,879
Oh, who could blame him?

280
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,052
Welcome to
Shattered Dreams Airlines,

281
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,821
where our motto is, what's
the point of going anywhere?

282
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,425
That poor man. I'll never know
what happened to him.

283
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,161
According to CyberStalker.com,

284
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,663
he now lives
in a small town in Texas.

285
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,167
Texas? That's where my friend
Louisiana Joe is from.

286
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,002
Marfa, Texas.

287
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,738
Why don't you go see him
and clear your conscience?

288
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:35,008
Plus, I always wanted to visit
Texas. It's open carry.

289
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,876
Oh, what do I do?

290
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,846
If I go see him, he might
punch me in the kisser,

291
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,215
or kiss me in the puncher.

292
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:45,085
Our manhood is
under assault, Sergeant.

293
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:48,688
Incoming gay panic!

294
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:54,527
Abe, promise me one thing.

295
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,264
Go see Philip.
Tell him you're sorry.

296
00:14:57,297 --> 00:15:00,533
Then find my girl
and tell her I loved her.

297
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:04,304
Find the milkman
and tell him one less milk.

298
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,773
Then find Branch Rickey
and tell him

299
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:09,943
to integrate baseball.

300
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:13,113
I have to go to Texas.

301
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:16,783
- Well, you're not going alone.
- We're all going to Texas.

302
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:19,419
The plant can get by without me
for a little longer.

303
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,459
Turn left at the stop sign.

304
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:29,129
Bear right onto the freeway.

305
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:31,631
Go absolutely straight for...

306
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,933
480 miles.

307
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:36,636
<i>I saw miles and miles</i>

308
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,305
<i>Of Texas</i>

309
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:41,441
<i>All the stars up in the sky</i>

310
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:44,277
<i>I saw miles and miles</i>

311
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,113
<i>Of Texas</i>

312
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,615
<i>Gonna live here</i>

313
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:51,518
<i>Till I die</i>

314
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:07,500
Prada?
In the middle of nowhere?

315
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,772
This isn't a store at all.
It's an art installation.

316
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,807
Marfa is the art capital
of Texas.

317
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:17,310
Over there are the Marfa lights.

318
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,779
Oh, how magical.

319
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,715
I know, they seem that way,
but there's an explanation.

320
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,951
- It turns out reflected light...
- Don't ruin it.

321
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,121
Why are you going
behind the installation?

322
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,457
It's by the side of the road,
so, by definition,

323
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,292
it's a bathroom.

324
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,964
That's where Philip lives.

325
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,968
37 miles to my destiny.

326
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,171
Son? As I've gotten older,

327
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:47,807
I've started to think maybe
a man can love different things

328
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,810
- and still be a man.
- Grampa's gay!

329
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,179
Why you little...

330
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,483
Wait, Homer!
No. Stop.

331
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,318
You might be strangling him

332
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,520
because of your own
conflicted feelings.

333
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,255
Why you thoughtful...

334
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:07,360
- Homer!
- Okay, time to go.

335
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,231
Now to face my greatest
fear...

336
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:14,301
someone who only
had love for me.

337
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:21,241
Better lock and load.

338
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:24,677
<i>There's a handsome man
in Texas</i>

339
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,414
<i>That I'm going back to see</i>

340
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:30,350
<i>He was supposed to take
my picture</i>

341
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,120
<i>Then he got sweet on me</i>

342
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:36,723
<i>I buried it for decades</i>

343
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,725
<i>Deep inside my brain</i>

344
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:41,361
<i>But then I played
with army men</i>

345
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,730
<i>And it came up again</i>

346
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,971
I'm seeing things.

347
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:59,078
Hello, Abe.

348
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:02,081
You've aged well,
like a fine onion.

349
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:05,084
I hope you can forgive
what I did to you.

350
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,254
I'm sorry I ruined your life.

351
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,922
Ruined my life?
You saved it.

352
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:12,592
- I saved it?
- Let me explain.

353
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,594
After I lost my job,

354
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:18,097
I decided I'd never live
anything but my truth again.

355
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:22,135
My wife took it well.

356
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:25,104
I hit the road and drove
as far as I could.

357
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:29,041
I landed here and I've never had
a day of regret since.

358
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,112
What's the matter?

359
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:35,782
You're such a wonderful guy.

360
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:38,751
Maybe it was my life
that was ruined that day.

361
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,120
It's never too late, Abe.

362
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:44,857
Never too late to find out
what your true self is.

363
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:47,194
A paper at Cornell University

364
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:51,164
has showed that no one
is 100% straight or gay.

365
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:53,966
- Is it peer reviewed?
- Does it matter?

366
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,103
I'm afraid I'm too old
to try anything new.

367
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,939
I miss the days
when circuses had elephants

368
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,808
and they stomped on people.

369
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:05,111
And don't get me started
on Young Sheldon.

370
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,714
Understood, but before you go,

371
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:10,717
we never did finish
that photo session.

372
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:23,129
It's a shot I always wanted
and never got...

373
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,131
Your beautiful smile.

374
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,666
Why didn't you say so?

375
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:29,969
I'll leave that with you.

376
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,339
Enjoy your life.

377
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:42,349
The Alamo's not the only thing
I'm gonna remember.

378
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,719
Well?

379
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,888
Sorry, my friend, this army man

380
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,157
is as straight as Gomer Pyle.

381
00:19:57,764 --> 00:19:59,165
Good for you, soldier.

382
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,734
You learned that army men
come in all orientations,

383
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:05,137
but we're all molded
from the same crappy plastic.

384
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,907
Permission to pair up, sir?

385
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,909
Granted.

386
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,912
Radio man, a little dance music,
if you please.

387
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:30,229
The local population hates us
and we don't know why we're here.

388
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:32,532
Maybe if we build a school,

389
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,966
they'll forget about
that hospital we bombed.

390
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,737
Congress didn't
fund enough body armor.

391
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,773
Well, this is too sad.
Let's melt 'em in the microwave.

392
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:43,610
Oh, boy!

393
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:46,313
<i>This is the Army,
Mr. Jones</i>

394
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:50,317
<i>No private rooms
or telephones</i>

395
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,289
<i>You had your breakfast
in bed before</i>

396
00:20:56,323 --> 00:21:00,293
<i>But you won't
have it there anymore</i>

397
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:04,263
<i>This is the Army,
Mr. Green</i>

398
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:09,936
<i>We like the barracks
nice and clean</i>

399
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:13,940
<i>You had a housemaid
to clean your floor</i>

400
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:17,910
<i>But she won't
help you out any more</i>

401
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:31,057
Last word!
