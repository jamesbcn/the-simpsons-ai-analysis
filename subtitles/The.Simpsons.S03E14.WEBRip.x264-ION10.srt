on it or anything.

139

140
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,794

Homer, is that you?

144
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,419
What should I say?

145
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,344
Well how about,
"Yes, it's me"?

146
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,473
Yes, it's me.

147
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,339
Tell her you love her.

148
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,836
I love you very much.

later tonight, I think you
and I should, uh...

152
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:14,851
snuggle?

153
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,024

Uh, why don't you
just wrap it up?

156
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:24,362
Look, Marge, I can tell
something's bothering you

157
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,074
but if you come out
of that car

158
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,534
I promise to do
whatever it takes

159
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,873
to make it better.

160
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,908
Please, honey?

161
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,622
Okay.

162
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,003
Cuff her, boys!

163
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,642
Off the record, ma'am,
all the gals on the force

164
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,810
-knew just how you felt.
-That's nice.

165
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,769
Do you think you could
loosen my cuffs?

166
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:55,849
No.

167
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,693
Don't you worry,
Mr. Mayor.

168
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,518
This little bird'll be cracking rocks
by the end of the week.

169

Wiggum, you glorified
night watchman, let her go!

170
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,692
But she broke the law.

171
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,435
Thanks for the civics lesson.

172
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,697
Now listen to me.
If Marge Simpson goes to jail,

173
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,319
I can kiss the chick vote
good-bye

174
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,486
and if I go down,
you're gonna break my fall!

175
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,116
Word to the wise, Quimby.

176
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,953
Don't write checks
your butt can't cash.

177
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,708
Hear me loud and clear Wiggum,
you bite me, I'll bite back.

178
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,790
You talk the talk, Quimby,
but do you walk the walk?

179

to be Marge Simpson Day

180

toss 'em a fish

183

and watch 'em slap
their fins together.

184
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:42,896
Well, all's well
that ends well.

185

-What?

200
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,139
I need a vacation.

201
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,687
What?! But, Marge,
we just had a vacation.

204
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,149
I need to unwind.

205
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,356
I know you do, Marge,

206
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,316
but come on, you know what
our vacations are like--

207
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,947
those three monsters
in the back seat

208
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,583
"Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?"

209
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,751
And let's face it, I'm no
day at the beach either.

210
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,370
"Marge, can I have
another sandwich?

211
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,247
Marge, can I have
another sandwich?"

212
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,004
No, I mean
a vacation by myself.

213
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,376
What?!

214
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,052
You mean we're getting
a divorce?

215
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,551
Marge, I can change.

216
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,842
No, Homie, no.

217
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,085
I still love you.

218
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,466
A lot of couples
take separate vacations.

219
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,394
Well, okay...

220
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,642

you're coming back.

221
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,274

the children while I'm away.

-Don't worry yourself.
-Uh-huh.

226
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,525
We've got six months
of maternity leave

227
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,784

gonna use anyway.

Homer, can you bring
Maggie out?

229
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,707

of that.

233
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,222
really doesn't want
to leave the house

234
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,430
maybe she should
just stay with you.

235
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,969
Are you sure
that's wise?

236
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,103
Uh-huh.

I've lost the baby.

It's the worst thing
I've ever done.

Don't worry.
Don't worry.

You know what
I'm gonna do?

I'm gonna make you
an omelet.

Just help me look.

386
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,686
I make them

-C'mon!
-Whoa!

388

I've got her.

391
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,622
Barney, you're gonna
pull her arm off!

392
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,410
The sooner
I get her out,

393
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,453

we can have omelets.
