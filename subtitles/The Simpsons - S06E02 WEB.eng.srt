1
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:08,633
The Simpsons.

2
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,747
Lisa, will you
keep it down?

3
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,808
I'm making a crank phone call
to Principal Skinner.

4
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,501
Well, as a matter of fact,
my refrigerator wasn't running.

5
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,420
You've spared me
quite a bit of spoilage.

6
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,630
Thank you, anonymous young man.

7
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,632
It's my room
and I can do what I want.

8
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,967
Oh, yeah?

9
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,344
Well, I can do what
I want in my room.

10
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,224
Bart, quit it!

11
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,145
I can keep this up all day.

12
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,323
Lisa, stop the racket.

13
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,884
I'm trying to fix
your mother's camera.

14
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:18,995
Now, easy, easy...

15
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,332
I'm gonna need
a bigger drill.

16
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:35,220
My, these seas are
certainly heaving.

17
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:39,182
Well, no more than your
bountiful bosom, milady.

18
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,394
Does that earring
mean you're a pirate?

19
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,896
Kinda.

20
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,732
Ah... The seas have quieted.

21
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,610
And only in the sweet
embrace of quietude

22
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,029
can two lovers truly be...

23
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,532
Ooh, such noise.

24
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,325
Well, I'm done
for the evening.

25
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,955
Lisa, stop
blowing my sex...

26
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,182
I mean, stop
blowing your sax.

27
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,582
Your sax, stop it.

28
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,959
Mom, I'm auditioning

29
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,627
for first chair
in the school band.

30
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,129
And I've got to practice.

31
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,840
I'm sorry, but I sacrificed
a very expensive camera

32
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,550
just to get some quiet time.

33
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,305
Fine.
I'll play outside.

34
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,769
Hey, why that sounds
like Gabriel's trumpet.

35
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,146
You know that means, kids.

36
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,107
Yay! Judgment day!

37
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,069
45 seconds till pencils down.

38
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,030
Lisa, what's the answer
to number seven?

39
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,282
Sorry, Ralph.

40
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,634
That would defeat
the purpose of testing

41
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,494
as a means
of student evaluation.

42
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,329
My cat's name
is Mittens.

43
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,499
Three, two, one, and
that's pencils down.

44
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,962
Now, here's an oral
extra credit question.

45
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,630
What was
Christopher Columbus

46
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,008
actually looking for
when he discovered America?

47
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,678
Anyone besides
Lisa for a change?

48
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,263
Enh, enh, enh!

49
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,265
Ralph, this better
not be about your cat.

50
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,767
Oh, all right, Li...

51
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,495
Columbus was looking
for a passage to India.

52
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,479
Oh, correct, Allison.

53
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,523
And on your very
first day in our class.

54
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,150
And during a subsequent voyage,

55
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,944
Columbus found what is now
the continent of South America.

56
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,487
Yowee.

57
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,698
I never made
Miss Hoover "yowee."

58
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,286
Hi, Allison.
I'm Lisa Simpson.

59
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,847
Oh, it's great
to finally meet someone

60
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,707
who converses above
the normal eight-year-old level.

61
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,209
Actually, I'm seven.

62
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,793
I was just skipped ahead

63
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,646
because I was getting bored
with the first grade.

64
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,505
You're younger than me too?

65
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,970
Are you hyperventilating?

66
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,806
No. I just like
to smell my lunch.

67
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,976
Gee, I never met anyone
who skipped a grade before.

68
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,537
I'm surprised you
haven't been skipped.

69
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,721
You're obviously
smart enough.

70
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,065
Well, I'm sure I could have,

71
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:55,610
but I'd hate to leave behind
all my wonderful friends.

72
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,654
Out of the way,
brain queen.

73
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,657
Hey, Sarah.

74
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,116
Well, I got to go.

75
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,869
I have to practice
for band auditions.

76
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,163
Me, too. Hey, what
instrument do you play?

77
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,164
The sax.

78
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,582
Me, too.

79
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,583
I'm going for
first chair this year.

80
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,751
Me, too.

81
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,503
Wow, with so much
in common,

82
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,421
I'm sure we'll be
the best of friends.

83
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,505
Me, too.

84
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,715
Me, too.

85
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,137
Hurry up and finish eating.

86
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,847
You're steering fine, boy.

87
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,724
Hard to the right!
Hard to the left!

88
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,726
Cat! Deer! Old man!

89
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,229
Jackknifed sugar truck.

90
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,439
Sugar?

91
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,963
Don't worry, buddy.
Here's a quarter.

92
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,130
Call for help
at the nearest phone.

93
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,447
I'll keep an eye
on things here.

94
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:45,535
If only this sugar were
as sweet as you, sir.

95
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,620
Homer, that was
downright decent of you.

96
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,330
We hit the jackpot here!

97
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,041
White gold, Texas tea...

98
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,376
Sweetener.

99
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,090
Dad, isn't this stealing?

100
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,717
Read your town charter, boy.

101
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,427
"If foodstuff
should touch the ground,

102
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,596
said foodstuff shall be turned
over to the village idiot."

103
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,391
Since I don't see him around,
start shoveling.

104
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,606
- Mom?
- What? What?

105
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,650
Why am I still rotting away
in the second grade

106
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,485
instead of being skipped ahead?

107
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,903
I don't know, honey.

108
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,822
I guess that's the school's
decision to make.

109
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,591
Well, did you ever talk
to anyone at the school?

110
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,284
Make a few calls
on my behalf?

111
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,512
Maybe you could have been "nicer"
to Principal Skinner,

112
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,996
if you know
what I mean.

113
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,999
Lisa... I am nice.

114
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,520
Homer, I really appreciate
you making dinner,

115
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,005
but this food tastes
a little strange.

116
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,631
It hurts my teeth.

117
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,134
That's because
I've loaded it with sugar!

118
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,971
Marge, our ship has come in.

119
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,183
I found 500 pounds of sugar...
In the forest...

120
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,185
That I'm going to sell
directly to the consumer,

121
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,979
and all for a low, low price
of one dollar per pound.

122
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,815
But the grocery store sells
sugar for 35 cents a pound.

123
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,109
And it doesn't have nails
and broken glass in it.

124
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,569
Those are prizes.

125
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,990
Ooh, a blasting cap.

126
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,205
It's your turn, Jimbo.

127
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,251
Mmm, someone's been
practicing over the summer.

128
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,378
Welcome aboard.

129
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,213
Yes!

130
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,340
! My lute!

131
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,719
Lisa Simpson trying
for first chair saxophone.

132
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,354
Mmm, very nice.
Now Allison Taylor,

133
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,398
also trying for
first chair saxophone.

134
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,201
Oh! This is a very
tough decision, girls.

135
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,577
You're both very good.

136
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,881
Well, I guess that
clinches that...

137
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,994
Oh! That was
a close one, Lisa,

138
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,745
but you made it.

139
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,122
I won first chair?

140
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,457
No, you regained
consciousness.

141
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,749
Allison got first chair.

142
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,884
Oh, it was just a dream.

143
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,719
Oh, that was
a close one, Lisa,

144
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:50,970
but you made it.

145
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,346
I won first chair?

146
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,848
No, you regained
consciousness.

147
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,349
Allison got first chair.

148
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,602
And believe me,
this is not a dream!

149
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,986
I need help, Mom.
There's another girl at school

150
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,322
who's smarter, younger, and
a better sax player than me.

151
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,282
Ugh, I feel so average.

152
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,993
Well, you'll always be
number one to me.

153
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:18,039
Ahem! Hello!
Firstborn within earshot.

154
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,374
I meant my number one girl.

155
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:22,835
Oh, for crying...

156
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,172
Honey, if you get
too competitive,

157
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,798
you'll never be happy.

158
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,509
No matter how good you are,

159
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,069
there's always going to be
someone better than you.

160
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,803
I always thought I had
the tallest hair.

161
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,848
But that trip to Graceland
really opened my eyes.

162
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,183
But she's better than me

163
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,976
at everything
that makes me special.

164
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,394
Believe me, honey,

165
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,813
she's more scared of you
than you are of her.

166
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,233
You're thinking of bears, Mom.

167
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,236
Sugar man.

168
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,864
Door-to-door sugar?

169
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,908
Well, marvelous idea.

170
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,034
What's that, Mother?

171
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,565
I'm just talking
to the sugar man.

172
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,665
Mother, I'm a big boy.

173
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,792
I can do as I wish.
Excuse me.

174
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,562
Thanks a lot, Simpson.
Now I'm grounded.

175
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,342
Hey, Allison, what's
the answer to number nine?

176
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,927
I can't tell
you, Ralph.

177
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,137
I can't tell you
either, Ralph.

178
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,223
Leave me alone.

179
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,307
Brainiac!

180
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,517
Nerd!

181
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,685
You geekazoid!

182
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,768
Leave me alone!

183
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,775
Ah, that used to be
my face in the mud.

184
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,695
I can't stand to see you
so miserable, Lis.

185
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,863
Unless it's from a rubber
spider down your dress.

186
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,240
Ooh, that gives me an idea.

187
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,658
Note for later:

188
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,910
Put rubber spider
down Lisa's dress.

189
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,855
Hey, I know.
How about if I dig up

190
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,798
some dirt on Allison?

191
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,441
Remember how I got Milhouse's picture
on "America's Most Wanted?"

192
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,238
There he is,
on the monkey bars.

193
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,972
Try to take him alive.

194
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,558
Oh, no! Not again!

195
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,455
I appreciate the offer,
but it goes against

196
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,064
every moral fiber
in my body.

197
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,984
Suit yourself.
If you change your mind, here is my card.

198
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,068
I don't need a card.

199
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,392
You live in the
room next to me.

200
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,573
Note: Next year,
order fewer cards.

201
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,658
And you didn't think
I'd make any money.

202
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,536
I found a dollar while
I was waiting for the bus.

203
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,788
While you were out
"earning" that dollar,

204
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,458
you lost $40 by
not going to work.

205
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,644
The plant called and said
if you don't come in tomorrow,

206
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,961
don't bother
coming in Monday.

207
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,880
Woo-hoo!
A four-day weekend!

208
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,221
Hey! I am above average.

209
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,015
So what if Allison's
ahead of me.

210
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:44,143
There's no shame
in being second.

211
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,146
And now, Avis Rent-a-car
is proud to present

212
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,899
the second best band
in America.

213
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,486
Will you welcome Garfunkel,
Messina, Oates and Lisa

214
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:57,740
singing their number two hit
"Born to Runner-up."

215
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,207
Why would they come
to our concert just to boo us?

216
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,060
Lis, I did some checking
on this Allison character,

217
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,628
and I know it's against
all your moral fibers...

218
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,754
Give it to me.

219
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,132
Hey, wait,
there's nothing bad here.

220
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,218
Yep. She's clean as a bean.

221
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,221
But I did tip off the feds
as to the whereabouts

222
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:23,140
of our good friend Milhouse.

223
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,810
I'm telling you,
I didn't do anything.

224
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:26,893
I don't care.

225
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,487
Ouch! My glasses!

226
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,076
Oh, I've got to stop
being so petty.

227
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,037
I should be Allison's friend,
not her competitor.

228
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,831
I mean...

229
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,917
she is a wonderful person.

230
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,252
Way to go, Lis.

231
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,087
I mean, why compete
with someone

232
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,690
who's just gonna kick
your butt anyway?

233
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,091
I prefer my phrasing.

234
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,220
It's great of you
to come over, Lisa.

235
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,139
I really want us
to be friends.

236
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,182
You're a wonderful person.

237
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,727
Hi, Lisa, I'm Allison's father,
Professor Taylor.

238
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,520
I've heard great things
about you.

239
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,355
Oh, really? I...

240
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,279
Well, don't be modest,
I'm glad we have someone

241
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,276
who can join us
in our anagram games.

242
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,236
We take proper names
and rearrange the letters

243
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,196
to form a description
of that person.

244
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,615
Like, oh,
I don't know, uh...

245
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,659
Alec Guinness.

246
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,994
Genuine class.

247
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,662
Ho-ho, very good.

248
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,291
All right, Lisa. Um...
Jeremy Irons.

249
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,796
Jeremy's Iron.

250
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,927
Well, that's very good
for a first try.

251
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,471
You know what?

252
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,431
I have a ball.

253
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,754
Perhaps you'd like
to bounce it.

254
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,275
What's this?

255
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,319
Oh, it's for the school
diorama competition.

256
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,779
You're finished already?

257
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,530
But the competition
isn't for weeks.

258
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,575
Lisa, we're talking dioramas.
Who could wait?

259
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,286
I chose "The Tell-Tale Heart,"
by Edgar Allan Poe.

260
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,122
See, this is the bedroom
where the old man was murdered,

261
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,542
and he's buried here
under the floorboards.

262
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,586
Oh, and look, I used
an old metronome

263
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:20,007
to simulate the heartbeat
that drove the killer insane.

264
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,761
Ha ha.
It's neat, huh?

265
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,096
It's great.

266
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,140
It's really great.

267
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,855
Oh, got away from you, huh?

268
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,149
Well, you keep at it.

269
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,996
Must... protect... sugar.

270
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,790
Thieves everywhere...

271
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,292
The strong
must protect the sweet.

272
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,753
The sweet...

273
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,756
Homer?

274
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,135
In America,
first you get the sugar,

275
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:10,724
then you get the power,
then you get the women.

276
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,269
Homer!
Homer?

277
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,145
- Wha-what?
- I want you to forget

278
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,564
about guarding
this stupid sugar.

279
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,649
You're being
completely paranoid.

280
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,067
Oh, am I?

281
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,485
Am I really?

282
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,570
Hello.

283
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,573
All right, pal.

284
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,925
Where'd you get
the sugar for that tea?

285
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,951
I nicked it when you
let your guard down

286
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,744
for that split second.

287
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,330
And I'd do it again.

288
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,456
Good-bye.

289
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,375
You see, Marge?
You see?

290
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,376
Homer, when are you
going to give up

291
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,003
this crazy sugar scheme?

292
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,004
Never!

293
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,547
Never, Marge.

294
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,300
I can't live
the button-down life like you.

295
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,426
I want it all.

296
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,760
The terrifying lows,

297
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,262
the dizzying highs,

298
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,555
the creamy middles.

299
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:53,267
Sure, I might offend
a few of the bluenoses

300
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,394
with my cocky stride
and musky odors.

301
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:59,899
Oh, I'll never be the darling
of the so-called city fathers,

302
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,568
who cluck their tongues,
stroke their beards,

303
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:06,572
and talk about, "What's to be
done with this Homer Simpson?"

304
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,491
Look, just get rid
of the sugar, okay?

305
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,993
No!

306
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,084
Hey! Get off my sugar!

307
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,628
Bad bees! Bad!

308
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,841
Oh, they're defending
themselves somehow.

309
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,845
Look, Bart.
It almost killed me.

310
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,306
But I handcrafted
all 75 characters

311
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,807
from "Oliver Twist."

312
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,518
And now... The coup de grace,

313
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,229
a bitter snowstorm.

314
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,317
Cool.

315
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,279
Is it okay?

316
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:51,951
Well, the important thing
is that we survived.

317
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,911
Ah! Who am I kidding?

318
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,497
There's no way I'm ever
gonna beat Allison.

319
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,916
Oh, sure there is.

320
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,503
But it involves being
a bit underhanded,

321
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:06,382
a bit devious, a bit,
as the French say,

322
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,800
Bartesque.

323
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,510
I'll do whatever it takes.

324
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,846
Then welcome to the
nether regions of the soul.

325
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,518
Now, here's what we do.

326
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,496
Tomorrow morning, when Allison
comes out of her house,

327
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,897
we spray her with the hose,

328
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,192
soaking her from head to toe,
leaving us relatively dry.

329
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,777
Relatively?

330
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,380
Well, there's bound to be
some splash-back.

331
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,865
Bart, her being wet won't
help me win the competition.

332
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,868
Well. We could just
sabotage her diorama,

333
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,013
humiliating her in front
of the students and faculty.

334
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,122
Perfect!

335
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,915
Leaving her primed
for the most traumatic

336
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,667
hose-soaking of her life.

337
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,293
Enough with the hose!

338
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,716
Well, it sure is quiet
in here today.

339
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,386
Yes! A little too quiet
if you know what I mean.

340
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,971
I'm afraid I don't.

341
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,349
You see, bees usually make
a lot of noise.

342
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,517
No noise...

343
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,352
suggests no bees.

344
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,813
Oh, I understand now.

345
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,106
Oh, look.
There goes one.

346
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,107
To the Beemobile!

347
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,775
You mean your Chevy?

348
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,152
Yes.

349
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,362
Well, very clever, Simpson.

350
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,322
Luring our bees
to your sugar pile,

351
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,533
and then selling them back
to us at an inflated price.

352
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,868
Bees are on the what now?

353
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,787
Simpson, you diabolical...

354
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,332
We're willing to pay you
$2,000 for this swarm.

355
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,667
Deal!

356
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,337
Oh, wait a minute.

357
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,421
The bees are leaving.

358
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,008
No!

359
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,677
My sugar is melting.

360
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,430
Melting! Oh, what a world.

361
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:42,061
The sugar's gone.

362
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,729
I'm sorry, Homie.

363
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:44,980
It's okay, Marge.

364
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,607
I've learned my lesson.

365
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,277
A mountain of sugar
is too much for one man.

366
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,695
It's clear now why God

367
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,448
portions it out
in those tiny packets,

368
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,826
and why He lives on
a plantation in Hawaii.

369
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,289
Ah, "Diorama-rama,"
My favorite school event,

370
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,957
next to
"Hearing Test Thursday."

371
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,292
"The Grapes of Wrath?"

372
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,293
I don't get it.

373
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,628
Here's the grapes.

374
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,506
And here's the wrath.

375
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,468
Yes, yes, very good wrath.

376
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,471
Ah, let's see, our foreign
exchange student Üter

377
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:21,225
has chosen "Charlie
and the Chocolate Factory."

378
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,601
I...

379
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,561
But this is just an empty box.

380
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,856
I begged you
to look at mine first.

381
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,024
I begged you.

382
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,235
Lisa.

383
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,820
Here is,
as the French say,

384
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,696
le fake diorama.

385
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,324
I'll create a diversion,
and you make the switch.

386
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,493
Hey, everybody!

387
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,577
Whoa! Look at me.

388
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,870
I'm over here.

389
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,039
Turn this way right now!

390
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,582
Hey, it's Bart.

391
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,709
And he's doing stuff.

392
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,508
Bart, stop creating

393
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,385
a diversion
and get out of here.

394
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,308
Okay, our next entry is
"The Tell-Tale Heart"

395
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,893
from Allison Taylor.

396
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,145
Mmm, I can't wait
to see this.

397
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,228
Be ready with the ribbon.

398
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,817
What is it?

399
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,610
It's a cow's heart.

400
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,905
They're trying to make
a monkey out of you.

401
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,616
Allison, is this
supposed to be

402
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,868
some kind of joke?

403
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,954
I didn't do that.

404
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,497
I made a different one.

405
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,915
Oh, is that so, young lady?

406
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,209
Well, where is
this phantom diorama?

407
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,670
I... I don't know.

408
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,721
At least have the guts
to take the blame, girl.

409
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,973
You're compounding
your folly by lying about it.

410
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,892
- Right on.
- Young lady, cow hearts

411
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,520
belong in a butcher's window,
not the classroom.

412
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,939
Well, maybe in an older student's
biology classroom,

413
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,399
but that's
none of my business.

414
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,276
Elementary school
is where I wound up,

415
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,079
and it's too late
to do anything about that.

416
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,864
Frankly, I'm starting to
regret skipping you ahead.

417
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,673
It's the beating
of that hideous heart!

418
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,469
I mean, I think
I hear something.

419
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,307
Why, here's Allison's
real diorama.

420
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,727
It got misplaced,
or so it would seem.

421
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,687
Oh, well, that changes
everything.

422
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,481
Let's have a look.
Get the ribbon ready.

423
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:39,196
A little sterile,
no real insight.

424
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,739
What do you think,
Miss Hoover?

425
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,744
This has been
a very disappointing day.

426
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,913
All right,
on to Lisa Simpson.

427
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,623
You're a shoo-in
now, Lis.

428
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,251
After the way I've behaved,
I don't deserve to win.

429
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,795
- Well, this doesn't deserve to win.
- What?

430
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,797
Ooh, now we're
into the dregs.

431
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,799
Here's Ralph Wiggum's
entry.

432
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:02,427
Prepackaged "Star Wars" characters
still in their display box?

433
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,388
Are those the limited edition
action figures?

434
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,973
What's a diorama?

435
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:09,059
Why, it's Luke and Obi-wan
and my favorite, Chewie.

436
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,769
They're all here!

437
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:11,770
What do you think?

438
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:12,771
I think it's lunchtime.

439
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,065
We have a winner.

440
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,699
I'm really sorry
about what I did, Allison.

441
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,159
It's no shame
being second to you.

442
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,786
Thank you, Lisa.

443
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,247
You know, I'm actually
kind of glad I lost.

444
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,667
Now I know losing isn't
the end of the world.

445
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,044
Hey, you still think
we can be friends?

446
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,130
Only if we're the best.

447
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,675
I beat the smart kids.
I beat the smart kid...

448
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:44,469
I bent my wookiee.

449
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,305
Hey, Ralph, want to come
with me and Allison

450
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,848
to play anagrams?

451
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,701
We take proper names
and rearrange the letters

452
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,852
to form a description
of that person.

453
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,354
My cat's breath
smells like cat food.
