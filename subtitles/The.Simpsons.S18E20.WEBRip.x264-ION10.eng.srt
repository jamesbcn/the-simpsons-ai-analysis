{\an8}I just meant we should split
up to get out of this corn maze.

78
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,440
{\an8}Deep down, I...
I guess I knew that.

79
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,609
{\an8}Now there must
be a way out!

80
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,019

I don’t want to live!

{\an8}Finally!

96
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,975
{\an8}I knew we could
solve that maze

97
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,733
using Tremaux’s
algorithm.

98
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,725

99

{\an8}No, you didn’t.

100
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,777
{\an8}Your plan was to
burn the corn.

101
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,200
That was never my plan.

00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,825
I don’t have
any holders!

105
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,286

ma’am.

00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,376

our elite canine unit in

112
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,845
Chief, I’m afraid Officer
Jaws is guilty of littering...

113
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,812
and here’s the litter!

114
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:14,112

with your
father’s scent.

126
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,757
Maybe there’s something
in Dad’s backpack.

127
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,934
A sports bra?

128
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,681
He just needs it for
walking upstairs.

Ahh...

138
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,267
-Dad!
-Dad!

139
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,147
Your dog’s
quite a tracker.

140
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,026
Say, has he ever thought about
A career in law enforcement?

141
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,487
(whimpering)

142
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,333
Um, I don’t think
he’s ever thought
about anything.

143
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,125
Santa’s Little Helper
would be an awesome
police dog.

144
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,749
Can he, Dad?
Can he?

145
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,586
No, and never bring it
up again!

146
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,011
-Please, can he?
-All right.

147
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,773
Boy, it is going to be so cool
when you’re a police dog.

148
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,857

153
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,116
Good boy!

154
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,464
Now, transform.

155
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,590
(laughs)

156
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,337
Cool.

157
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,219
CHIEF WIGGUM:
All right, listen up.

158
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,391
For the next two weeks,
I’m gonna be your worst enemy,

159
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,221
except this Thursday
is the Fourth of July,

160
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,136
so we’ll take Friday off
as well.

161
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,144
Well, I guess Wednesday
everybody’s going to be thinking

162
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,186
about the long weekend, so...
eh, what the hell?

163
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,980
Why don’t we just take
the whole week off?

164
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,937
Why did you let me do that?

165
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,145
We are so far behind.

166
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,694
(dogs growling)

167
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,068
Nice work, canines.

168
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,658
Bring in the next group.

169
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,663

171
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,558
Uh, should I get this blow
back to the cage, Chief?

172
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,232
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
"Blow? Cage"?

173
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,601

since Caleb Smith Woodhull,

180
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,951
Rudolph Giuliani!

181
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,867
(clears throat)
Friends, parents, Chief Wiggum.

182
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,327
What?

183
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,416
And of course graduates!

184
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,171
Who’s a good boy?
You’re a good boy!

185
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,213
Look at that tail.

186
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,875
Waggy waggy waggy!

187
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,054
Who’s got a fuzzy tum-tum?

188
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,011
You got a fuzzy tum-tum.

189
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,142
Who wants a treat?
You wants a treat.

190
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,309
I wish someone had
told me that at my graduation.

191
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,229
Listen to me, rook, these
streets are hard.

192
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:22,558
It ain’t like <i>Air Bud V:</i>
<i>Strong Arm Of The Paw.</i>

193
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,895
<i>Attention all units:</i>
<i>domestic disturbance in progres</i>

194
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,481
<i>at Rural Route 27.</i>

195
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,106
Domestic disturbance?!

196
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,032
You’re gonna have one hell
of a first day, boy.

197
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,241
Squeak ’em
if you got ’em.

198
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,160
(toy squeaking)

199
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,619
You gave that hog
a day of beauty,

200
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,542
and I didn’t get nothing!

201
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,750
Manicure...
pedicure...

202
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,211
exfoliation!

203
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,462
(startled bark)

204
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,463
Don’t worry, boy,

205
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,054
she just knocked
a few fleas off you.

206
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,509
You’re gonna be okay.

207
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,629
We need backup now!

208
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,635
Cletus, you coward!

209
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,391
Is you man or turtle?

210
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,102
Here’s your answer.

211
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,062
Skittle, skittle,
scurry, skittle.

212
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:06,273
Okay, since the dog’s not here,
I’m gonna take you for a walk.

213
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,860
(yowls)

214
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:14,856
(sighs)

215
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,777
What’s the matter, Bart?

216
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,236
Oh, I miss Santa’s
Little Helper.

217
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,617
I wanted him to be a police dog,
but now he has no time for me.

218
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,955
I even have to eat
my own homework.

219
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,173
(coughing)

220
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,922
(electrical buzzing)

221
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,353
(whimpering)

222
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,678
Hey, could you
set us up down here?

223
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:46,938
Easy there, pal.

224
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,111
We just started
our shift.

225
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,229
(growls)

226
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,685
(walkie-talkie squelches)

227
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,145
<i>WIGGUM:</i>
<i>Attention K-9 unit.</i>

228
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,784
<i>We got an 866 in progress</i>
<i>at the park. Over.</i>

229
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,412
Chief, why are you using
the walkie-talkie?

230
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,409
I can hear you fine.

231
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,331
Fine. Let’s not use
any of our police equipment.

232
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,331
So, uh, you got
any steroids?

233
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,415
Oh, you know it.

234
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,880
I can make you huge.

235
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,379
(all gasp)

236
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,421
I want to pump my guns.

237
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,795
I want to rip my pecs.

238
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,841
I want to shriv my nards.

239
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,425
"Nards," that’s what
we needed to hear.

240
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,471
Freeze!

241
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,763
(all gasp)

242
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,176
Ha!

243
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,684
Nobody ever freezes.
Might as well just say "run."

244
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,860
Catch me if you can,
little bow-wow.

245
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:33,782
Ha-ha!

246
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,945
(snarling)

247
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,833
No!

248
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,052
Nice work... partner.

249
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,054
(ducks quacking)

250
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,391
(deep, guttural):
Quack, quack, quack...

251
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,356
You stand accused of giving
hope to scrawny young men.

252
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,399
How do you plead?

253
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,901
Guilty...
of being innocent!

254
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,574
(all laugh)

255
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,412
(snarling)

256
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,908
Well, I’m afraid,

257
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,370
because of this improperly
filled-out police report,

258
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,371
I have no choice
but to let you go.

259
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,583
Case dismissed.

260
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:27,912
Ho-ho!
Don’t worry, dude,

261
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,207
I’m going straight...

262
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,330
straight to my customers
to sell more drugs.

263
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,458
(growls)

264
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,723
Listen, man, you
got to let it go.

265
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,719
Relax for a couple
days with your family.

266
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:41,721
Come back fresh on Monday.

267
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,769
(growls)

268
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,350
Boy, you’re back!

269
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,313
Ow! You bit me!

270
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,396
My own dog bit me!

271
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,080
I can’t believe it.

272
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,830
My own dog bit me.

273
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,082
Now that he’s had
a taste of human flesh,

274
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,754
the dog will be a slave
to its succulence.

275
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,833
Look at him eyeing me.

276
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,038
He knows I taste best.

277
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,417
Don’t blame
the dog, folks.

278
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,424
A cop’s life
is so intense,

279
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,966
he has to channel it
somewhere.

280
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,969
Me, I knit
violent imagery.

281
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,852
Pretty grim, huh?

282
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,060
Oh, I love Santa’s Little
Helper, but I don’t know

283
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,061
if we can have him
in our home anymore.

284
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,813
Mom, you can’t
send him away!

285
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,555
He’s a dog,
not Grandpa!

286
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,267
What if Santa’s Little Helper
stops being a police dog,

287
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,238
then he can get a nonviolent
job like barking songs

288
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,739
on novelty Christmas records.

289
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,241
You can do it, boy!

290
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:47,282
(barking "The Dreidel Song")

291
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,198
No, boy, that’s Hanukah!

292
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,576
Forget it, kid.
He’s a cop now.

293
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,374
Well,
I bet he can’t resist this.

294
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,127
Fetch, boy!

295
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,302
My God! I’ve lost him.

296
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,131
(Homer barking)

297
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,126
Homer!

298
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,467
(chortling)

299
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,762
Oh, relax, Marge.

300
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,845
I’m just messing
with you.

301
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,469
I know
I’m not a dog.

302
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,556
I’m a people, like you.

303
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,230
(water running)
(growling)

304
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,689
Homer, it’s just Flanders.

305
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,849
You know him.

306
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,557
(growling and barking)

307
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,485
You’re going to live
with me now ’cause...

308
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,161
’cause only cops
understand cops.

309
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,279
Hey, Lou, want to party tonight?

310
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,026
Oh, not tonight,
Sharquelle.

311
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,578
I’m hanging out
with my new roommate.

312
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,751
Oh, my God!
A police dog!

313
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,171
Oh, I have a friend
who would love him.

314
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,962
(whimpering)

315
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,796
Okay, but just remember:
They don’t love us.

316
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,184
They just
love the uniform.

317
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,811
All right, now,
who’s going with who?

318
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,849
I don’t want
a new dog.

319
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,444
I want my old dog.
The one who bit me.

320
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,059
Cheer up, boy.

321
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,106
We’ll get you their
most vicious street cur!

322
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,939
He’ll bite your ass raw!

323
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,275
No street curs!

324
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,659
That’s it!
I want a snake!

325
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,120
Oh, no problem, pally.

326
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,750
Our pythons cost
five dollars a foot.

327
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,745
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

328
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,293
We’re not made of money!

329
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,746
All right.

330
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:23,877
(blade whacks)

331
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,595
He is so awesome.

332
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,559
I already love him
more than I love Lisa.

333
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,390
It says here
don’t bother naming them.

334
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,976
Snakes have poor hearing,
and only live to strangle.

335
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,072
I like it. "Strangles."

336
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,818
Hey, Lis, you want
to touch Strangles?

337
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,110
He’s not slimy at all.

338
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,993
He’s scaly.

339
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,030
Eww! He <i>is </i>slimy!

340
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,533
That’s because
I soaked him in slime!

341
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,075
(laughing)

342
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,528
Why, you little...

343
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,408
I’ll teach you
to trick your sister!

344
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,616
(both choking)

345
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,836
Homer, can you breathe?

346
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,221
Well, I can breathe out okay.

347
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,089
(wheezing)

348
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:13,096
Don’t... give...
snake... attention.

349
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:19,440
It’s what...
he really... wants!

350
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,440
I’m okay.

351
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,821
After months of practice,

352
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:27,149
I have trained my rabbit
to hop in perfect tempo

353
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:31,616
to Mussorgsky’s immortal
<i>Pictures at an Exhibition.</i>

354
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,789
Now for some hip-hop
we can all get down with!

355
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,155
(gasps)

356
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,798
Bart Simpson, you can’t
bring a python to school!

357
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,919
Hey, don’t
ask me to show

358
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,086
if you can’t
handle the tell.

359
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,763
(all laughing)

360
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,642
Well, I’m going to <i>show </i>you
to the principal,

361
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,350
and <i>tell </i>him
all about it.

362
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,931
(laughing)

363
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,731
Mine was as funny as his.

364
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,861
No one’s arguing with you, lady.

365
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,818
Now, can we
just learn something?

366
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:05,978
Oh!
The snake’s getting away!

367
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,118
(alarm blaring)

368
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,778
(all screaming)

369
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,077
(siren wailing)

370
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,665
(sniffing)

371
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,668
(barking)

372
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,295
The snake
must be in there.

373
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,221
(barking)

374
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,762
(growling)

375
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,676
(playful growling)

376
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,850
You miss him,
don’t you?

377
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,765
Lou, he’s got
to get over it.

378
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,444
I miss Shamrock Shakes,

379
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,022
but they ain’t coming
back till March!

380
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,277
You know, Chief,
Shamrock Shakes

381
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,068
are just vanilla shakes
colored green.

382
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,702
I taste the flavor.

383
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,199
It’s a very mild mint.

384
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,740
Well, maybe, because
it’s a minty color,

385
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:55,913
your mind
is fooling your tongue.

386
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,031
I know what I taste!

387
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,327
I got to go with
the chief on this one.

388
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,911
Whoa! There’s
a big surprise.

389
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,201
Hey, Lou, what’s your
favorite thing in the world,

390
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,914
so I can dump
all over that?

391
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:46,576
(all screaming)

392
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,457
Time for a head count.

393
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,594
Children, line up according
to height.

394
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,210
No, weight.

395
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,216
No, the sum total of the letters
in your last name

396
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,838
if each letter
is assigned a numeric value

397
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,505
according to its place
in the alphabet.

398
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,433
Quickly, now!

399
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,849
Deadly toxic cloud!
Deadly toxic cloud!

400
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,813
Bart’s missing.

401
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:06,904
He must still be
in the school!

402
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,729
(whimpering)

403
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,275
No, boy!
It’s too dangerous!

404
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,988
Let him go, Lou.

405
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,818
He’s not following
his nose this time.

406
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,863
He’s following
his heart.

407
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,487
Sometimes I forget
why you’re chief,

408
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,454
but I remember now!

409
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,794
You follow
your heart, boy!

410
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:29,132
Here, Strangles!
Strangles?

411
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:33,129
(woozily):
Oh...

412
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:36,723
Oh, man, it’s like
some chemicals cut one.

413
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,930
Strangles, you came to save me!

414
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,635
Santa’s Little Helper,
you came, too!

415
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,819
Sorry, but a boy’s got
to go with his dog.

416
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,325
And... saved!

417
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:13,206
Hero cop saves boy!
Hero cop saves boy!

418
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,682
Oh, I knew
you loved me, boy!

419
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,175
Now you can be
my dog again.

420
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,149
Don’t worry.
I’ll give ya a home.

421
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,526
That’ll do, snake.

422
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,989
That’ll do.

423
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:36,422
Shh!
