1
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:08,375
Homer,
get your lazy butt out of bed!

2
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:09,877
You're gonna be late for work!

3
00:00:09,944 --> 00:00:12,846
Going to work!

4
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,294
Hey, what's the haps,
pop‐diggity?

5
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,029
What's wrong with you?

6
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:32,533
Can't you talk like
a normal 55‐year‐old man?

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,969
You'll never understand
hip‐hop, Dad.

8
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,804
I understand plenty.

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,739
You're wasting your life

10
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:40,908
trying to be
some kind of d'jay.

11
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:42,576
It's DJ, dad.

12
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,845
You'll see,
I'm gonna have my moment.

13
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:47,214
Check your watch,
it's Homer Time!

14
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,151
Where you going, Homer?

15
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,087
To my happy place.

16
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,828
All right team, the word
of the day is upsell.

17
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,864
Every medium pizza
should be extra‐large

18
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,433
and every thin‐crust
should be deep dish.

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,636
Mozzarella is money.

20
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:11,605
Do I make myself as clear
as this Crystal Pepsi?

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,675
Ah, pointless.

22
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,777
Okay, everyone, it's showtime.

23
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:19,446
Homer, plug in the band.

24
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,516
What's up, party people?

25
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,485
Put your greasy hands together

26
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:28,255
for the Razzle Dazzle
Rockin' Rollin' Revue!

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,030
<i>A‐one, two, three o'clock,
four o'clock, pizza</i>

28
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,499
<i>A‐five, six, seven o'clock,
eight o'clock, pizza</i>

29
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,535
<i>We're gonna pizza
around the pizza tonight</i>

30
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,476
<i>We're gonna pizza around</i>

31
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:53,480
<i>The pizza tonight</i>

32
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,822
Oh, listen
to that applause, Wakkety.

33
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:04,358
Those kids love pizza rock!

34
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:06,560
You suck, Yak.

35
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:11,231
Kids, I tell you,
our pizza can't be beat.

36
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,035
Pizza can't...
I... beat kids...

37
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:17,838
I beat kids.
I beat kids.

38
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,175
That robot's
threatening the kids.

39
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,509
Everyone's leaving.

40
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,179
Do something!

41
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,349
This is my moment.

42
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:35,956
<i>All right, stop</i>

43
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,358
<i>Grab a plate and listen</i>

44
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,126
<i>Yak is back
with a menu addition</i>

45
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:41,462
<i>Regular toppings
don't get the job done</i>

46
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,364
<i>Premium toppings
get my mouth sprung</i>

47
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,532
<i>Slice, slice, baby</i>

48
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,468
<i>Sun‐dried tomatoes</i>

49
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,470
<i>Slice, slice, baby</i>

50
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,638
<i>Canadian bacon</i>

51
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,707
<i>Slice, slice, baby</i>

52
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,809
<i>Kalamata olives</i>

53
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,878
<i>Slice, slice, baby</i>

54
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:00,314
<i>Premium toppings, yo</i>

55
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:02,082
You know what,
instead of pepperoni,

56
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:03,917
let's get the Canadian bacon.

57
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,320
So premium.

58
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:07,955
<i>Sauce to your pizza</i>

59
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,427
That was a heck of a show.

60
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:16,964
I was selling Nutzo Bread
like it was Weirdo Wedges.

61
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:21,335
Say, instead of pizza versions
of old songs,

62
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:24,505
we should be playing
pizza versions of new songs.

63
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:27,307
Homer, I want you to create
a whole new show,

64
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,610
ripping off the music
you care about.

65
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:33,313
All the Ices from Cube to T.

66
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,748
Thank you, Mr. Gunderson.

67
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:38,285
Guys, we got
a lot of work to do.

68
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,053
I beat kids.

69
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,690
Beat kids.
Beat kids.

70
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,192
Dad, tonight's

71
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,337
my big show at the pizza place.
You're coming, right?

72
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:50,164
Son, I don't know
quite how to put this, but

73
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,533
you're a fool
and your dreams are garbage.

74
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,968
Now, get out of here before
I say something I'll regret.

75
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:58,205
I'll show you who's a fool.

76
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:00,773
Such a jerk.

77
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:06,480
Big crowd out there.

78
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,415
You guys are
gonna be great tonight.

79
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,917
I know it.

80
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,486
That's okay, it's just nerves.

81
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:14,288
Dah, the place is packed.

82
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,490
This is why
I went into business...

83
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:19,393
to make money.

84
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:24,164
Homer Cool J Simpson presents
the new and improved

85
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:28,035
Phuntime Phunky Phour!

86
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,170
<i>Whoomp, there it is, pizza</i>

87
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,940
<i>Whoomp, there it is, pizza</i>

88
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,313
<i>Whoomp, there it is</i>

89
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,614
Whoomp, who are you?

90
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:43,016
FBI.
We're shutting this place down.

91
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,953
This business is a front
for drug trafficking.

92
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,988
Confiscate those robots.

93
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:49,723
But they're innocent.

94
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,059
You're just harassing them
because they're rappers.

95
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,530
D'ope!

96
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:58,365
That cocaine isn't mine.

97
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,367
I never touch
sweet, sweet booger sugar.

98
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,136
Let's all buy Beemers
with hundred‐CD disc changers...

99
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:04,605
they fill the whole trunk!

100
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,173
MTV, baby!

101
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:11,778
No, don't take my friends.

102
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,113
No!

103
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,384
Told ya.

104
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:25,325
And I never saw
my robot friends again.

105
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,794
So, are we still

106
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,163
going to Ralph's birthday party?

107
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,834
Never! This is where
my dreams died.

108
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,669
I almost didn't get these cones,

109
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:39,139
and you know what,
I'm glad I did.

110
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:52,452
Homie, it's been three days
since that terrible memory

111
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,389
came back, and you haven't
said anything about it.

112
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,391
Oh, that?

113
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,560
What a silly thing
to get upset about.

114
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,829
I totally overreacted.
It's all in the past now.

115
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,798
Oops, don't want
to be late for work.

116
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,967
Love you.
Love you all.

117
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,735
I can't stand

118
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,671
to see him like this.

119
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,506
What?
Dad looks happy.

120
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,274
Something's deeply wrong.

121
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:17,244
He's missing
his youthful spirit,

122
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:19,479
that spark that
makes him who he is.

123
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,649
Did you see
how he ate his breakfast?

124
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,918
He didn't shuffle his pancakes

125
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,154
like a deck of cards.

126
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,855
He doesn't
air‐drum while driving

127
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:32,526
or race the dog in butt scooting
across the carpet.

128
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,027
And he always won.

129
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:37,164
He's not my Homie anymore.

130
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,799
We didn't notice any of that.

131
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:42,102
A wife knows.

132
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,338
And a bartender.
He's just...

133
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,973
He's just not the same.

134
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,542
He don't spin Barney around
on the stool no more.

135
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:52,512
He don't drink beer from a crazy
straw, just a sensible straw.

136
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:56,283
What are we gonna do
about our little man, Midge?

137
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,387
We're just gonna
have to love him that much more.

138
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:03,624
I didn't think
that was possible.

139
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,995
I'm used to seeing Mom
upset about Dad, but Moe...

140
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,796
that really shook me.

141
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,999
How do we heal
the 14‐year‐old boy

142
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,635
who lost the thing
he cared most about...

143
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:18,071
rapping pizza robots?

144
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:21,108
What?
It's a very Dad kind of trauma.

145
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,611
Well, if losing those robots
screwed him up,

146
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:27,948
what if we somehow
found them again?

147
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,985
Dad told us
Gil used to be his boss,

148
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,954
so maybe Gil could help us.

149
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:37,591
And I know
just where to find him.

150
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,170
Razzle Dazzle's...
that was many lives ago.

151
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:52,739
I was top of the heap,
making kids happy

152
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,242
with music and pizza.

153
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,744
My Dad said you were
also selling drugs.

154
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,046
Ah, the drugs
sold themselves, kid.

155
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,182
The whole world was my nostril.

156
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,951
Look, after you went away,

157
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:06,519
what happened
to those singing robots?

158
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,622
Well, the FBI
sold them at auction,

159
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,124
but I never lost track
of my babies.

160
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,193
I'm gonna get those robots back,

161
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,362
and start a new kiddie
pizza place,

162
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,598
then use that as a front
to sell even better drugs!

163
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,767
Gimme that.

164
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,670
This is it.
They're all here.

165
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:27,440
Lis, we're getting
the band back together.

166
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,717
You can't take Jive Turkey.

167
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,886
He's the centerpiece
of my priceless collection

168
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,222
of disco memorabilia.

169
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,224
For God's sake, Stuart.

170
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,059
Get rid of this stuff.

171
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,896
You've wasted your life
on America's worst music craze.

172
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:53,566
I'm just glad your father,
Doo‐Wop Steve,

173
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,835
didn't live to see this.

174
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,738
Take him.

175
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,373

00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:13,853
Please, Professor.
This mechanical...

180
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,455
What is it, a beaver?

181
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:19,159
It's the key to my husband's
emotional recovery.

182
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,997
Well, I understand that need
to develop an attachment

183
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,300
to a piece of machinery
to combat loneliness.

184
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,701
What do... What do you say, boys,

185
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,837
should I... should I
just let her have him?

186
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,739
Free him, you monster.

187
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,207
Free all of us.

188
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:37,210
He programs us to lose.

189
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:43,149
Why would I,
a major local celebrity,

190
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,852
possess a robot
from a defunct pizza parlor?

191
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,854
The very notion is absurd.

192
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,756
Oh, of course.
I'm sorry, sir.

193
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,691
My mistake.
Sorry to bother you.

194
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,827
Oh, there is
one more thing, sir.

195
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,472
I see that you go through
a lot of this

196
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:59,265
mechanical oil stuff here.

197
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,902
Well, there's a perfectly
logical explanation, Bartender.

198
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:07,106
I spray it
on my rusty door hinges.

199
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,042
Oh, right, now I get it.

200
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,286
You don't want anyone
to know that

201
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,278
a respectable gent like yourself

202
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,914
is using this here WD‐40

203
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,549
and this silk kimono

204
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,385
and this Enrique Iglesias CD

205
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,487
with your sex robot!

206
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,030
Oh, yeah, the yak.

207
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,233
I used him
to test the Kevlar vests.

208
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,034
I liked the way
he would sing about pizza

209
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,970
every time
I shot him in the chest.

210
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:40,306
You're a little late though.
I just sold him to those guys.

211
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,852
Where... Where
are you going with that?

212
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:47,247
We're taking it to the new
local offices of J.J. Abrams.

213
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,815
J.J. Abrams.

214
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:52,919
What's a big Hollywood director
doing in Springfield?

215
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,988
Making the next Mission Impossible.

216
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,323
Downtown Springfield's
standing in for Somalia.

217
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,592
What does he want with
this rickety piece of junk?

218
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,827
As a visionary genius,

219
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,595
J.J. needs to be kept
in a constant state

220
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,430
of childlike wonder,

221
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,233
so we fill his creative
space with kitsch,

222
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,202
whimsy, memorabilia.

223
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,572
J.J. needs a Garbage Pail Kids
pinball machine

224
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,341
and a roll of 1982 quarters.

225
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,610
Go, go, go!

226
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,548
Can I help you?

227
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,717
Yeah, we're a cool, young,

228
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,954
brother‐sister directing team
and we'd like to speak

229
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:32,191
to a low‐level executive
about a vague idea we have.

230
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,960
Super vague.

231
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,695
Right away!

232
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,873
There's the yak.

233
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,609
But how are we gonna
get it out of here?

234
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:01,254
Step away from the kitsch.

235
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:04,190
What are you thinking, trying to
steal from a Hollywood big shot?

236
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:06,359
That's like murdering
a dozen normos.

237
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,728
Sorry, Dad. We thought
it would make you happy

238
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:11,097
if we got your old band
back together.

239
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:14,901
The Phuntime Phunky Phour?
That's impossible.

240
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:18,171
I'll never
see those guys... again.

241
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,107
Yak.

242
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:22,442
It's you.

243
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,178
What a touching scene.

244
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,780
I know just how to shoot it.

245
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,115
- It's J.J.!
- Roll his calls!

246
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,850
Don't step on his shadow.

247
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,453
Oh, no, I'm wearing
the same shirt as him.

248
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,421
- Hi, I'm J.J.
- Homer Jay.

249
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,256
Sorry my kids
tried to steal from you.

250
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,500
It's just that they were trying

251
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,961
to get this old robot back,
so... so...

252
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,297
So they could reunite
the entire animatronic band

253
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,699
to heal the broken teenager
inside of you.

254
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,436
How did you know my secret pain?

255
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,372
I didn't.
My storytelling sense told me

256
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,241
this was the only emotionally
cathartic end to your journey.

257
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,377
Master of story!

258
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,380
He's the ultimate architect
of cinematic universes,

259
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,148
and my dad's friend.

260
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,219
I need to see
all the robots together.

261
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,553
Wipe to...

262
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,256
Foxxy, Turkey,

263
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:12,191
Hippie, and Wakkety!

264
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,993
You're all here.

265
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,396
I've never seen such
genuine childlike wonder.

266
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,398
And I've been to dozens
of test screenings.

267
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,600
Homer, your emotional connection
to these characters

268
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,268
has shown me
that your journey can be

269
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,569
a universal experience,

270
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,505
- or at least Dreamworks.
- What?

271
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,440
I'm gonna make these robots

272
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:30,743
the stars of their own
nine‐movie franchise.

273
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,078
Buy the underlying IP.

274
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,113
- Done. You own it.
- Fantastic.

275
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,848
- Take them away.
- Take them?

276
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,583
But we just got reunited.

277
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,452
Oh, but I need them.
My visual effects artists

278
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,020
have to scan them
into supercomputers

279
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,456
so our mind‐blowing reboot

280
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:46,526
March 30,
the new Fourth of July.

281
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,628
No!

282
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:54,901
No! The same thing
happened again,

283
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,470
but slightly different,
years later.

284
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,539
It's what I do.

285
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,582
I had them back
and I lost them again.

286
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,718
Homie, I know
how hard this is for you.

287
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,254
I always say
you shouldn't do this,

288
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,890
but maybe, just this once,

289
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,059
you should go eat your feelings.

290
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:22,361
Six feelings with extra cheese.

291
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,663
An order of French feelings,

292
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:27,400
and a super chocolate
frosty depression.

293
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,036
I also recommend
a hot apple cry.

294
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,306
Yes, I recognize
a fellow sadness swallower.

295
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:38,110
And then J.J. Abrams
took my robots away...

296
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,947
so he could reboot them.

297
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,416
Why do Hollywood guys
only want to make movies?

298
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,285
I used to be like you,
getting angry at filmmakers

299
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:49,355
who ruined my favorite
childhood characters,

300
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,757
stewing in silence.
But now,

301
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:55,528
thanks to the internet,
I can fight back.

302
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,530
- You can?
- Oh, yes, my friend.

303
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:58,965
It is called trolling.

304
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,368
Thanks to social media
super‐soldiers like myself,

305
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,804
studios spent millions to remove

306
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:07,573
Sonic the Hedgehog's
creepy human teeth.

307
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,509
We changed the world

308
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,811
of video game adaptations
I never saw.

309
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,913
Then I'll do it.
I'll become a troll,

310
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,882
stop J.J. Abrams' reboot,

311
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,551
and save my childhood.

312
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,553
And now I'm eating a feeling

313
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,655
I've never felt before.

314
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,879
Marge, I've done it.

315
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,156
The boycott
is gaining momentum...

316
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,783
the supportive comments
are pouring in.

317
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,119
Three of them!

318
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:56,455
Homer, please. You've missed
so much of your life.

319
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,790
Of our lives.

320
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:00,192
It's only a movie.

321
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,498
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Maybe I have been

322
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:09,334
taking this nostalgia‐fueled
vendetta too far.

323
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:12,938
Pizza movie news alert.

324
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,740
Hey, Springfield.
I'm inviting you

325
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:17,442
to come to the Aztec Theatre
tonight for a special preview

326
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,179
of my new animated movie,
Agents of P.I.Z.Z.A.

327
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:24,082
How dare he do
what he said he was gonna do!

328
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,727
I paused just long enough
for anyone watching

329
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,820
to say something.
And now, here's a little...

330
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,390
slice of what
you'll see tonight.

331
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:36,295
They'll save the world
in 90 minutes...

332
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:38,330
or the movie is free.

333
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,666
Written by Tony Kushner
and Babaloo Mandel.

334
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:42,467
No.
This reimagining

335
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,037
is worse than
I could have ever imagined.

336
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:48,173
I've got to stop that screening.

337
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:54,379
There's only one person
who can help my Homie now.

338
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,548
- Who are you calling?
- No, don't tell us...

339
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,417
It'll be cooler
when we find out later.

340
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,956
Reboots suck
and you're to blame,

341
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:06,491
make it different, but the same!

342
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,294
Thank you, loyal trolls, for joining me
in my passion project,

343
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,999
destroying someone else's
passion project.

344
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:17,302
Yes, every fan deserves movies
that are individually tailored

345
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,638
to their preconceived ideas.

346
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,908
Let's ruin everyone's night!

347
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,845
Welcome to this preview
of Agents of P.I.Z.Z.A.,

348
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,013
featuring the voice talents

349
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,148
of whoever was famous
eight months ago.

350
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,085
But the real heroes
are the thousands

351
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:35,487
of computer artists
who worked around the clock,

352
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,522
slowly going blind,
at such effects houses as

353
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,658
Dream Prison, Digital Sweatshop,

354
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,194
Indentured Server‐dudes,
and too many others to count.

355
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,629
- Or pay.
- Yeah!

356
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,197
And now, without further ado...

357
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:48,267
Did somebody ask for ado?

358
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,036
Hey, Homer.
Good to see you.

359
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,972
Yeah, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

360
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,775
This man took simple,
beautiful animal robots

361
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,610
designed to sell pizza

362
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:01,346
and turned them into something
crass and commercial.

363
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,750
Well, it's all over, J.J.

364
00:18:04,816 --> 00:18:07,619
if those are your real initials.

365
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:17,496
I'm going to burn
the only copy of this movie.

366
00:18:17,562 --> 00:18:20,332
Actually, the movie's backed up
on servers all over the world.

367
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,199
That reel is just a prop
from the snack stand.

368
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,470
I wondered why it was buttery.

369
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:28,774
You can't release this movie.
Changing those characters

370
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,077
- will ruin my childhood.
- Bullpucky!

371
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,350
So that's who
Mom called earlier.

372
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,352
So satisfying.

373
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,689
Son, a movie
can't ruin your childhood.

374
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:47,359
I ruined it
by being a terrible father.

375
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,028
- But the movie.
- No, it was me.

376
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,698
I put you down,
I never listened to you,

377
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,334
said your dreams
were ridiculous.

378
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,302
Maybe it was the way
I was brought up.

379
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,604
Men back then
could only love sports stars

380
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,773
and auto makes.

381
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,810
I was a Chevy man
and I thought that was enough.

382
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:07,813
The '63 Impala SS sport coupe...

383
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:10,615
Now, that was a son.

384
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,785
Of course.
It's not the movie that sucks,

385
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,121
it was you sucking.

386
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,590
It was always you sucking.

387
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:22,227
I hate you, Dad.

388
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:27,165
Homer, I know you were
attached to the past,

389
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,968
but this movie,
all 71 minutes of it,

390
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,503
might help
a new generation of kids

391
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,338
forget their terrible parents.

392
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:37,242
- Like us, Dad.
- I want to forget so bad.

393
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,812
Go on, make your movie.

394
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,147
It's literally already done.

395
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,783
I guess the only time
I'll see my friends now

396
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,685
is on the big screen.

397
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,754
Well, actually...

398
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,527
The band is back together.

399
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:56,862
I had them reprogrammed

400
00:19:56,928 --> 00:19:59,664
to dispense frozen yogurt
at the after party.

401
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,867
Goodbye, old friend.

402
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:04,703
You'll always be a part of me.

403
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,553
To all who dare reboot a movie,

404
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,954
comic book, or TV show...

405
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:26,291
you are being watched
by Troll Force Five!

406
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,728
Mary Sue, who writes
fan fiction starring herself.

407
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:32,397
Harry Potter turned and said,
without Mary Sue,

408
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,033
I never could have brought
Dumbledore back to life.

409
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,368
The Furry, the ultimate expert

410
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,571
on poorly‐rendered CGI hair.

411
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,973
That's not what it looks like
when a bear sweats.

412
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,475
The Shipper, able to detect

413
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:46,478
romantic connections
where, clearly, none exist.

414
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:49,481
C‐3PO and Chewbacca
are definitely a couple.

415
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,416
Stan, who can ruin anything

416
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,518
by loving it too much.

417
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,886
Together, we are...

418
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,530
<i>Your mother's got flavor,
your father's got the flavor</i>

419
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,008
<i>Your sister and your brother
and your cousins</i>

420
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,467
<i>Got the flavor, the flavor</i>

421
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,202
<i>Flavor that
you crave so much</i>

422
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:12,103
<i>Flavor with boom,
flavor that goes crunch</i>

423
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,672
<i>Tell me, who's got flavor</i>

424
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:14,738
<i>I do, I do</i>

425
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,774
<i>Who's got flavor</i>

426
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:16,875
<i>I do, I do</i>

427
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,143
<i>Who's got flavor</i>

428
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,277
<i>I do, I do</i>

429
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,479
<i>Who's got flavor</i>

430
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:21,680
<i>I do, I do</i>

431
00:21:21,746 --> 00:21:22,881
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

432
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:23,949
<i>The funky hip‐hop</i>

433
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,651
<i>Feel the beat drop</i>

434
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:27,718
<i>Hour after hour</i>

435
00:21:27,752 --> 00:21:28,752
<i>Sweet, nothing sour</i>

436
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,156
<i>Kick it like horsepower</i>

437
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,491
<i>Who's got flavor</i>

438
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:33,692
<i>I do, I do</i>

439
00:21:33,758 --> 00:21:34,693
<i>Who's got flavor</i>

440
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:35,694
<i>I do, I do</i>

441
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,695
<i>Who's got flavor</i>

442
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:37,696
<i>I do, I do</i>

443
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:38,697
<i>Who's got...</i>
