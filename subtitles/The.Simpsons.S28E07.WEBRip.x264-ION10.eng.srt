and for a lot less.

119
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,731
How much less?

120
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,648

costs six bucks there.

They're like bananas you have to cook.
Yum.

are too hard for me to chew.

this trip will be fun.

you need to see a "fee-sa-kia-trist."

Excuse me, sir.

150

We are perfectly able
to pronounce "psychiatrist."

Now, please don't make me
'splain it to you again.

Come on, Rick.
The girls are dressed up like men,

154
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,137
So you know what we do, Fred?

155
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,016
We give them cigars. (laughs)

156
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,984
All the cigars they want.

157
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,154
(laughs) This will be good.

158
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,073
I'll never understand why a bandleader

159
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,822
was such good friends with his landlord.

(Cuban music playing)

161
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,158

...professional research...

165

I don't know what
either of those words mean.

166
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,335
-...educational activities...
-Those words I know and hate.

167
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,013
-...family visit...
-Is there a VIP entrance to this place?

168
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,302
-...religious activities...
-(laughing) God, no.

169
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,346
-...public performances...
-Never.

my cartilage in the '70s,

345
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:11,163
and that cartilage
became part of Hank Aaron's wrist.

346
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,463
Dad, you're happy now because
the new thing is always exciting.

347
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,578
Remember when you got that new pillow?

348
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,245
Oh, that was a mighty fine pillow.

349
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,335
Hypoallergenic.

350
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,340
Oh, what kind of father
would you be if you left me now?

351
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,013
Son, all you see in me is a burden!

352
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,272
Think of me every time
you don't visit someone!

(chuckles)

365
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,720
I'd like to speak to
your black ops department.

366
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,473
-Right downstairs, Mr. Simpson.
-Thank you.

367
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,715
Hmm. How did they know my name?

368
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,848
(whirring)

369
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,984
(whistling a tune)

370
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,691
I don't know where my dad is.

371
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,821
Don't worry-- each AARP card

372
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,648
contains a secret tracking chip.

373
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,743
(laughs)
The magazine is pretty good, too.

374
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,899
-Super easy Sudoku.
-Quiet!

375
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,408
This could take a while.

376
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,739
Bam! Got 'em!

377
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,035
Now you have to do a favor for us.

378
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,709
How many baseball players
can you sneak home with you?

379
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,708
Well... I have to ask my wife,
but I'd say 12.

380
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,041
Bam! Done!

381
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,210
Andre here sold secrets to the Soviets.

382
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,006
And this is the guy

383
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,090
who came up with the service fee
for Ticketmaster.

384
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,386
(grunts)

385
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,469
Do you know any good people?

386
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,965
Everyone's got their embarrassments, Abe.

387
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,477
-I'm sure you got yours.
-HOMER: Dad!

388
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,650
And up he walks.

389
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,309
What are you doing here?
Who are these people?

390
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,278
This guy was the biggest drug lord
in North American history.

391
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,779
And this guy invented Ticketmaster.

392
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,572
You charged me to sell me something!

393
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,196
Pleased to meet you, sir.

394
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,954
(whispers)
Abe, come with me to the cockpit.

395
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,747
Are we gonna fly or make love?

396
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,130
You will sit there, move nothing,
and do as I say.

397
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,128
Hot dog! Makin' love!

398
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,800
(grunts)

399
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,966
(American accent)
Miami, this is Jitterbug Justice

400
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,512
bringing back an early bird special.

401
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,306
-Miami, do you copy?
<i>-MAN (over radio): Uh, we copy.</i>

402
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,100
The nightclub is flying away.

403
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,397
Can't we hold on to anything?

404
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,491
GRAMPA: Boy, I didn't think
I'd ever be able to do this again!

405
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,948
All you have done is fly
without falling asleep.

406
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,029
Just like on my honeymoon.

407
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:58,124
I'm starting to suspect
you're not a simple Cuban bartender.

408
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,002
No, I'm an undercover agent
for the CIA

409
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,370
here to recapture fugitives
from U.S. law.

410
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,497
<i>And when I saw you,</i>
<i>I realized you'd be the perfect carcass</i>

411
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,335
<i>to tempt these old buzzards.</i>

412
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,800
(sputtering, stammering)

413
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,130
Is there anything I get out of this?

414
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,676
-Yes. You avoid the knockout gas.
-Aw.

415
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,471
-(gas hissing)
-(body thud)

416
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,265
Oh, thank God.

417
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,809
Usually I can never sleep on planes.

418
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,193
Sometimes I... (weak groaning)

419
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,440
(thuds)

420
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,781
(loud buzzing)

421
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,492
(flamingos honking)

422
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:40,373
So, that's the end of my Cuban paradise.

423
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:44,042
And like every good thing in my life,
I've already forgotten it.

424
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,383
Listen, Dad, I know it was fun,
but your place is with us,

425
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,919
not on some island in the Indian Ocean.

426
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,303
I love you.

427
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,800
(both sobbing)

428
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,180
Oh, now we're two men hugging.

429
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,353
This is no sight for the streets of Miami.

430
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:05,142
(both sobbing)

431
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,687
Hey, Dad. It's a beautiful day.

432
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,311
Want to hit the links?

433
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,978
Oh, just like we used to.

434
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,113
(horn blows)

435
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:19,156
-(laughter)
-Screw you!

436
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,084
(horn blows)

437
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,583

438
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,004
Look over there.

439
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,378
I just painted a black circle
on the green.

00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,921

00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,005

00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,506

(grunting)

444
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,635
Now, boy, it's 50 cents a golf ball

445
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,095
from that water hazard.

446
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,685
