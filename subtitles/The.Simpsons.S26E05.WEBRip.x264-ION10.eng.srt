You can't drill underneath people's homes
without their permission.

As chairwoman

183
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,278
Natural Resources,
and Blimp Safety,

184
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:07,988
your fracking operation
is hereby shut down.

189
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,504
I will find a way to shatter that shale.

192
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,125
Maybe the planet wants a strong man

193
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,383
to take her by the hand and lead her.

194
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,215
You don't know
what the planet wants.

195
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,180
Oh, and I suppose you do?

196
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,010
The planet wants to be
protected and nourished

197
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,716
and maybe even...

198
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,476

If I want to resume fracking,

228
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,725
To win people over,
I'll need a salesman

masks a deep gusher of greed.

You're now my chief

Whoo-hoo!

235
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:24,174
All you've got to do is sell fracking
to your friends and neighbors.

236
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,248
Whoo-hoo?

237
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,173
I don't know, "fracking" is
one of those scary Lisa words.

238
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,802
Bah! Fracking produces
enough clean natural gas

239
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,050
to make America independent
of sheiks, caliphs, and...

240
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,593
Scandinavians.

241
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,846
Not to mention,
it doesn't create any of that awful

00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,098

Maybe fracking isn't so bad.

246
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,571
Then say yes to this raise,
this promotion,

247
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,479

I'm so proud of you, Papa.

253
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,955
Some folks will tell you
that fracking's no good,

254
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,711
but what they don't tell you is,

255
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,633
hydraulic fracturing creates jobs.

256
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,552
And all those new workers
are gonna want

257
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:17,221
to spend their earnings
buying what you're selling-- beer.

258
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,971
Authentic Italian food.

259
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,973
Useless left-handed crap.

260
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,715
Magical nonsense.

261
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,017
Expensive toys for grown-ups
they don't open or play with.

262
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,812
Pornography and nachos.

263
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,555
High-quality
Spanish-language programming.

264
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,858
High-quality methamphetamines.

265

Laundry, homework, pranks,
poop, poop, and poop.

266
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,740
But our water was on fire.

267
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:42,123
How could you sell fracking
for Mr. Burns?

268
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,451
'Cause I've never gotten
a promotion before.

269
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,157
Once I thought I had,
but it turned out

00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,287
-so judge me all you want.
-I am judging you.

272
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,377
-Good. Judge away.
-Judge, judge, judge.

273
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,012
-Don't care. Don't care.
-Judge, judge, judge.

-Don't care. Don't care.
-Judge, judge...

It's a gas cash... blast?

278
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,851
<i>Residents of Evergreen Terrace</i>

280
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,187
Mr. Burns is a vampire,

281

sucking the lifeblood of this town

282
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,480
and lining his coffin with cash.

283
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,408
Oh, Maxine, no one insults me
in a sound bite the way you do.

284
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:23,908
Oh, Monty,
you're such a sexy little Nosferatu.

286
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,580
I'll bring the oxygen.

287
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,873
-(quietly) Better bring two tanks.
-Hmm?

288
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,287
And so, we see a clear correlation

289
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,667
between industrial hydro compounds

290
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,215
and water table contamination
well outside the...

306
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,456
Mr. Burns, we did it!

307
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:21,006
Everyone in the neighborhood
sold us their gas rights!

308
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,431
Hmm.

309
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,852
Excellent.

310
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,770
No, no. It's excellent. It's excellent.

311
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,848
Uh, maybe you can help me, Simpson.

312
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,774
You've had a relationship
or two in your life.

313
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,362
(laughing) Well... one.

314
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,728
I have embarked
on a "beneficial friendship"

315
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,857
with a woman with whom
I have nothing in common.

316
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,664
Her opinions are abhorrent to me,
but the passion.

317
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,778
Well, look at these racy texts
she sends me.

318
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,286
{\an8}(rhythmic clicking)

319
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,119
Oh, baby.

320
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,626
How long can I sustain
this high-wire act

321
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,958
of loathing and lust?

322
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,804
Well, I'm no Carl
when it comes to this stuff,

323
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,590
but I ain't no Lenny, neither.

324
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,134
And I would say...

325
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,387
no matter how much you try
to keep things casual,

326
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,640
someone always gets hurt.

327
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,522
Hmm.
Well, then I must harden my heart

328
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,480
against such an outcome.

329
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,483
I appreciate the counsel, Simpson.

330
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,435
Now, please trap-door yourself out.

331
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,316
Glad I could be of help!

332
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,653

333
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,582
Do you have the signed gas leases?

334
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,251
Hold on. This feels light.

335
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,000
Ah.

336
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,922
One of these deeds
is missing a signature.

337
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,131
The gas rights transfer form
for 742 Evergreen Terrace

338
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,672
was never signed by...
Marge Simpson.

339
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,387
(gasps)
Marge, why didn't you sign?

340
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,258
Our water was on fire!

341
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,306
I'm sorry, but the law states

342
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,560
that unless every single resident
sells their rights,

343
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,273
Burns can't frack drop one!

344
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,364
ALL: Oh!

345
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,070
Oh, I was counting on that money
to pay for my other calf implant.

346
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,361
MOE: Yuck.

347
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,034
I already felt the pride
of energy independence.

348
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,283
(overlapping crowd chatter)

349
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,155
Marge Simpson,
I'm as mad at you

350
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,543
as you usually are at me!

351
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,461
-(gasps)
-Hmm!

352
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,879

353
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,418
(wind whistling)

354
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,212
Cheer up, Monty.

355
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,086
All you lost was money,

356
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,683
but what you get is... me.

357
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,756
{\an8}(cracking)

358
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,267
All I lost was <i>money?</i>

359
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,940
Let me make one thing
perfectly clear.

360
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,769
Our dalliance meant nothing to me!

361
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,774
You were but a sprig of parsley
garnishing my beefsteak.

362
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,357
Now I cast you aside
for the busboys to gnaw upon.

363
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,204
Considered this ill-conceived
affair terminated!

364
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,570
(gasps)

365
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,407
(chuckles)
I played this just perfectly.

366
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,079
HOMER: Oh, yeah, great.

367
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,497
Great, Marge, great work.

368
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:06,626
Thanks to you, Springfield will never
be a natural gas boomtown,

369
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,885
and like all boomtowns,
it would have lasted forever.

370
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,429
Oh... our water was on fire.

371
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:17,024
Oh! <i>Was</i> on fire. <i>Was!</i>

372
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,141
I finally got a job I was good at,

373
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,018
and now I have to give it up!

374
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,515
(grunts)

375
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,646
So, you've come begging
not to be fired?

376
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,704
Smithers,
turn my back on this man!

377
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,108
Maximum huff!

378
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,867
Wait, Mr. Burns.
I'm here to man up.

379
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,370
It was all my wife's fault!
(sighs heavily)

380
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,212
Sometimes I think she and I
have nothing in common!

381
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:41,038
Nothing in common, eh?
Tell me more.

382
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,495
Marge likes sushi.

383
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,634
I like gum that squirts in your mouth.

384
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,302
She's into romantic comedies.

385
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,130
I like movies where there's only
one day a year when murder is legal.

386
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,387
Yup, Marge and I see the world
in totally different ways.

387
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,220
Hmm. Different, exactly.

388
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,305
That's why I had to give my woman
the old heave-ho.

389
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,732
So, you don't miss
that politics lady at all?

390
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,691
Not for one Chinese second.

391
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,611
And I'm sure
she's forgotten all about me.

392
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,823
(both gasp)

393
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,401
HOMER: Killdozers.

394
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,946
Whatever are you doing, man?!

395
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,410
We're tearing down this place
and putting up a recycling center,

396
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,121
slash Native American history museum,

397
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,042
slash condor sanctuary.

398
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,501
(screeches)

399
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,541
Hmm. A project this bloated
and ill thought out

400
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,745
could only be the work
of an angry liberal.

401
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,336
(gasps) Maxine!

402
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,881
My ex is using the thing
I hate most against me--

403
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,335
big government.

404
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,755
(grunts)

405
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,433
-(chatter)
-(camera shutters clicking)

406
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,511
Stop this ribbon cutting!
This is private property!

407
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,388
What's the matter, Mr. Burns?

408
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,935
Never heard of eminent domain?

409
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,439
You're just doing this
to get back at me for dumping you!

410
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,611
That is ridiculous.

411
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,909
(gasps)
The Antonin Scalia bedroom!

412
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:57,619
It's a National Public Radio
broadcast center now.

413
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,121
Who are you?

414
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,163
I'm Robert Siegel,
and this is <i>All Things Considered.</i>

415
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,287
(theme music playing)

416
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,130
{\an8}-(groaning)
-Stop laying about, you!

417
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,546
{\an8}There's work to be done!

418
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,144
{\an8}(weakly) Or Gravy Thursday.

419
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,180
If that woman thinks
she's been scorned now,

420
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,473
she ain't seen nothing yet!

421
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,687
(clacking)

422
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,985
It's fracking time.

423
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,819
(squeaking)

424
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,074
(whooshing)

425
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,196
(rumbling)

426
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,374
(groaning)

427
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,543
(Bart groaning)

428
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,622
(grunts)

429
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,286
(groans)

430
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:52,457
Is one of the side effects
of fracking earthquakes?

431
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,378
(voice shaking) Yes!

432
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,642
What are you doing?
You're destroying this neighborhood.

433
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,313
Just like you destroyed my mansion.

434
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,353
I don't know what I ever saw in you,

435
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,646
you planet-ruining monster!

436
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,320
Likewise, you planet-saving succubus!

437
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,189
(metallic rattling)

438
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,280
Homer, turn off that horrible machine!

439
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,905
You don't know anything
about hydraulic fracturing!

440
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,913
You've just been brainwashed
by liberal TV shows

441
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,496
who use fracking
as an easy bad guy,

442
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,832
but it can save this country!

443
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,587
Our... water... was...

444
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,840
on... fire!

445
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,222
Wait.
I finally get what you're saying.

446
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,891
Fracking is great,

447
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,469
but the only place it should ever happen

448
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,095
is in other people's towns!

449
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,603
Hmm.

450
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,194
(grunting)

451
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,650
(grunting nervously)

452
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,786
You always do the right thing...
sort of.

453
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,501
What is he doing?

454
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,964
He was furious at that woman,
now he's embracing her.

455
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,255
He told me himself
they had nothing in common.

456
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,339
Nothing except passion.

457
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,514
-Mm.
-(cracking)

458
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,223
(hearts beating)

459
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,263
I was a fool
to break up with you, Maxine.

460
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,387
I'm sorry I turned your home
into a liberal paradise.

461
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,225
You think we could make <i>us</i> work?

462
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,731
I don't know.
We're pretty different.

463
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,483
But we've got passion,
and as long as we've got that,

464
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,436
our lives will never get boring.

465
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,567
Mmm.

466
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,743
Oh, there's free jazz on Saturdays
at the art museum.

467
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,500
Now they say omega-3 pills
are bad for you.

468
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,708
My sister's dog had puppies.

469
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,290
What kind?

470
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,547
What kind of what?

471
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,009
What kind of dog
does your sister have?

472
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,335
I don't know.

473
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,403
{\an8}What color drawer pulls
did you want?

474
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,363
{\an8}Nickel or brushed nickel?

475
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,952
{\an8}Oh, I wish we'd bought
the more expensive theater tickets.

476
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,831
{\an8}I'll never see anything in row BB.

477
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,710
{\an8}There's a sale on lawn furniture
at the Lawns Plus.

478
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,420
{\an8}Why are all cars black or gray now?

479
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,884
{\an8}It's like if you see a red one,
it's a big deal.

480
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,474
{\an8}I'm thinking about
wearing a watch again.

481
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,194
-(crowd murmuring)
-Shh!
