00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,605
Yeah, hi.
How you doing?

348
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,170
So, uh, let's get
right to it.

349
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,527
I don't drive
a Lexus, okay?

350
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,286
I don't have a Learjet or some
big beach house in la-la land.

351
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,170
l am just a nice man
who makes a decent living.

352
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,846
So I guess I should probably
just go shoot myself, huh?

353
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,721
Hmm?

354
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,805
Oh, don't get
quiet on me.

355
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,564
Please, I hate when
they get quiet.

356
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,727
(AIR HORN BLOWS)

357
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,847
Ta-da!

358
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,684
I know what you're
thinking, but don't worry,

359
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,603
I'm old enough to date.
(CHUCKLING)

360
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,444
(WHISPERING)
Dermabrasion!

361
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,730
MARGE: <i>I think
he's a male gay.</i>

362
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,404
(AIR HORN BLOWS)
Ah!

363
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,290
I have to admit something,
I feel a little silly.

364
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,203
Oh, me, too.

365
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,648
I can't believe anyone ever really
finds anyone at these things.

366
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,371
Yeah, I was dragged here
by my older brothers.

367
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,046
We used to be quintuplets,
but three of us drowned.

368
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,321
(GRUNTS)

369
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,881
I really know where
you're coming from.

370
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,007
(AIR HORN BLOWS)

371
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,570
Oh, l guess
we have to move on.

372
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,928
Do we? We're adults. Why don't
we just go get a cup of coffee?

373
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,650
I'd love to.

374
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,884
(CHUCKLING)

375
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,721
Ooh-la-la.

376
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,211
I smell romance.

377
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,129
It's a perfect night
for love.

378
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,244
Would you pretty ladies care
to join us for some champagne?

379
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,641
Go suck a rat,
Assanova.

380
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,321
(CLOCK TICKING)

381
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,926
(PHONE RINGING)

382
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,001
(GASPS)
That might be Marge!

383
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,370
Don't answer it.
Savor the sound.

384
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,323
(CONTINUES RINGING)
Oh, boy...

385
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,207
Marge?

386
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,681
Homer, I don't want to
alarm you, but right now

387
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,526
we're looking at your wife yukkin'
it up with a good-looking guy.

388
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,080
He just touched her arm and
now they're being quiet.

389
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,811
But it's not
an awkward silence.

390
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,043
Yeah, it's more like a "nothing
needs to be said" kind of silence.

391
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,247
(SCREAMS)

392
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,409
I just think the best thing
a person can do

393
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,926
for the world is to
be clean and polite.

394
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,964
Wow, that's what
I would have said.

395
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,284
Well, I would have said, "Polite
and clean," but wow, still.

396
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,604
Oh, no! He's Marge's,
and my, dream man.

397
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,121
I've got to make a play for her
now Or I might lose her forever.

398
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,846
Uh!

399
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,851
(SPITS) D'oh!

400
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,721
At least she found someone
who can make her happy.

401
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,370
Oh, Marge, l feel like the two of
us can say anything to each other.

402
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,568
You really mean that?
I do.

403
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,088
I've got amnesia
and I have three kids.

404
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,962
Wow. My first thought
is "respect,"

405
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,487
both for your mental illness and
your ability to get back into shape.

406
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,404
My second thought
is "goodbye."

407
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,848
You idiot!
Ah!

408
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,490
Do you know what
you just gave up?

409
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,561
Who the hell are you?

410
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,361
The wisest, wettest
man you'll ever meet.

411
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,811
Go on. You just walked
away from the sweetest,

412
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,803
most beautiful woman
a guy could want.

413
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,761
In 10 years, she never had the last slice
of pizza and she's never complained.

414
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,841
Every election,

415
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,641
she wishes she could vote for both
guys because they both seem nice.

416
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,520
And there's alight inside her that
makes everyone else look better.

417
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,728
And you blew her off.

418
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,928
Dude, she's got
three kids.

419
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,281
(GASPS)

420
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,687
Really?
Well, she's still great.

421
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,960
Hmm.

422
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,566
MARGE: Mr. Simpson.

423
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,649
I may not know
much about you,

424
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,445
but you sure know a lot of
wonderful things about me.

425
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,363
And that means
a lot to a woman.

426
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,124
I still don't
remember you.

427
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,286
But for the first time since this
happened, l wish l did, Homer.

428
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,251
I'm so happy we're together again.
Want to get a drink?

429
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,446
You drink?

430
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,331
Uh, yeah, I started when
you were in the hospital.

431
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,890
Oh, I was so worried.

432
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,805
Recently I tried this
thing called beer, and...

433
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,804
(GASPS)
I remember everything!

434
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,565
You get drunk
all the time.

435
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,926
Oh.

436
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,082
But do you also remember
that you're an enabler?

437
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,481
Oh, of course I do.

438
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,608
That's why we're
such a great team.

439
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,725
(TIRES SQUEALING)

440
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,326
MARGE: You've been drinking
today, haven't you?

441
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,722
HOMER: l sure have,
partner.

442
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,401
MARGE: <i>I remember him.</i>

443
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,641
HOMER: <i>What about her? </i>
MARGE: <i>No, I don't know.</i>

444
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,767
<i>And her?
Oh, and her.</i>

445
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,649
<i>And her'!
Uh-huh. And him.</i>

446
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,926
<i>Well, what about him?</i>

447
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,411
<i>Mmm, I don't
recognize that name.</i>

448
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,811
<i>Yeah. I have their
baseball cards.</i>

449
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,927
<i>Oh, I know all them.</i>

450
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,565
<i>Look at all those people.
You know them?</i>

451
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,290
<i>Wow. She still
works here?</i>

452
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,203
<i>Yeah, she's over
in post now.</i>

453
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,283
<i>Oh, I always liked
that guy.</i>

454
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,566
Not me.

455
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,122
<i>But we can't get rid of him because
he's friends with Richard Sakai.</i>

456
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,807
<i>Oh, and there's a familiar name.
And another one. Wait.</i>

457
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,451
<i>Whatever happened to that
guy from the network?</i>

458
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,681
<i>Did he get married?</i>

459
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,683
<i>Oh, he ain't
getting married.</i>

460
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,091
(CHUCKLES)

461
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:40,969
<i>He has commitment issues.</i>
