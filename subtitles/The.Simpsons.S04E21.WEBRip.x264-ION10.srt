must be broken.

177
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,604
If you could just move
a bit to your left.

178
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,016
(whispering) 8'6...

179
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,691
Oh, Sanjay, help
Mrs. Simpson with her bag.

180
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,771
And while you're at it...

181
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,816
(both speaking
foreign language)

182
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:51,908
Hmm...

183
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,658
(gasps) Mrs. Simpson,
you did not pay for this bottle

184
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,865
of Colonel Kwik-e-Mart's
Kentucky Bourbon.

185
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,286
Oh...

186
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,714
no, I...

187
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,962
I guess I didn't.

188
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,214
-(siren blaring and tires screeching)
-(gasps)

189
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,884
All right, come out
with your hands up,

190
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,757
two cups of coffee,

191
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,853
an auto freshener
that says "Capricorn,"

192
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,850
and something
with coconut on it.

193
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,436
Now, Marge, you've come
to the right place.

194
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,982
By hiring me as your lawyer,

195
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,475
you also get this
smoking monkey.

196
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,278
Better cut down there,
Smokey.

197
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,492
Mr. Hutz...

198
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,822
Look, he's taking
another puff!

199
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,907
Mr. Hutz, this was
all a misunderstanding.

200
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,664
I didn't mean
to take anything.

201
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,456
Now don't you worry,
Mrs. Simpson.

202
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,000
I... uh-oh.

203
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,753
We've drawn Judge Snider.

204
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:47,836
Is that bad?

205
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,340
Well, he's had it in for me

206
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,132
ever since I kinda
ran over his dog.

207
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,046
You did?

208
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,844
Well, replace
the word "kinda"

209
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,047
with the word "repeatedly,"

210
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,717
and the word
"dog" with "son."

211
00:09:58,806 --> 00:09:59,886
(groaning)

212
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,524
Look, Marge,
I'll just talk to Apu,

213
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,442
and I'm sure
he'll be reasonable.

214
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,690
(singing and Indian
music playing)

215
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,613
Apu!

216
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,192
I'd like you to drop
the charges against my wife.

217
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,028
No offense, but we're
putting that bitch on ice!

218
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,695
Now, come on!
I'm your best customer.

219
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,294
I'm sorry, Mr. Homer,

220
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,369
but it is the policy
of the Kwik-e-Mart,

221
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,165
and its parent corporation
Nordyne Defense Dynamics,

222
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,879
to prosecute shoplifters
to the full extent of the law.

223
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,304
(singing and Indian
music playing)

224
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,176
Don't tell anyone,

225
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,561
but Marge Simpson was
arrested for shoplifting.

226
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,890
Let the word go forth
from this time and place,

227
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,726
Marge Simpson is a shoplifter.

228
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,152
Hey!

229
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,860
In other news, the chick
in "The Crying Game"

230
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,611
is really a man.

231
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,993
(booing)

232
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,990
I mean, man,
is that a good movie.

233
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,373
(cheering)

234
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,829
And last Christmas,

235
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,739
Marge made us
gingerbread men,

236
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,867
and there was a hair in one.

237
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,544
Well, I'll let you in
on a little secret

238
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,753
about Marge Simpson.

239
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,042
She's got webbed toes.

240
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,456
-(chuckles)
-Eww, that's gross.

241
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,755
Oh, puh-lease.

242
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,929
Now, Marge
don't you worry.

243
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,508
We've all had our
brushes with the law.

244
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,354
(knocking)

245
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,349
Are you Ed Flanders?

246
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,971
No. Ned Flanders.

247
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,228
My mistake.

248
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,064
{\an8}I'll never have
that problem again.

249
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,817
Um... will you excuse me
while I go and freshen up?

250
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,572
I'll follow her.

251
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,329
(water running)

252
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,365
Just wash your hands

253
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,497
and get out.

254
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,093
(groaning)

255
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,625
MAN: Ladies
and gentlemen of the jury

256
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,046
who do you find
more attractive,

257
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,545
Tom Cruise
or Mel Gibson?

258
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,887
What is the point of all this?

259
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,432
Your honor,
I feel so confident

260
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,806
of Marge Simpson's guilt

261
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,653
that I can waste
the court's time

262
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,729
by rating
the superhunks.

263
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,984
(excited murmuring)

264
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,776
Ooh, he's going to win.

265
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,740
Mr. Hutz!

266
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,200
Now, Mrs. Lovejoy,

267
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,780
could you tell us
a little about Marge Simpson?

268
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,946
Well, as the wife
of the minister,

269
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:27,084
I'm privy to a lot of
sensitive information.

270
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,503
And here it is.

271
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,041
Marge's husband
doesn't earn much,

272
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,674
and the family's a mess

273
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,881
and quite frankly,
I think she, um....

274
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,473
Let the record show

275
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,178
that the witness made
the drinky-drinky motion.

276
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:50,351
And if we freeze on frame 138,
we distinctly see

277
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,106
a puff of blue hair
coming from the grassy knoll.

278
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,230
Now, Apu, Mrs. Simpson
claims that she forgot

279
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,698
she was carrying
that bottle of...

280
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,909
delicious bourbon,

281
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,239
brownest
of the brown liquors.

282
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,735
So tempting.

283
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:07,787
What's that?

284
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,460
You want me to drink you?

285
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,788
But I'm in the middle
of a trial.

286
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,884
Excuse me.

287
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,173
(ringing)

288
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,126
Hello, David?
I'm really tempted.

289
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:26,388
Just take it one day at a time,
and know that I love you.

290
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,312
I love you, too, man.

291
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,350
So, Mr. Nahasapeemapetilon,
if that is your real name

292
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,646
have you ever
forgotten anything?

293
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,980
No.

294
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:39,235
In fact, I can recite pi
to 40,000 places.

295
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,238
The last digit is one.

296
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,660
Mmm, pie.

297
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,699
Well, if you never
forget anything

298
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:49,663
tell me this:
What color tie am I wearing?

299
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,825
You are wearing

300
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,753
a red and white
striped club tie

301
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,752
in a half-Windsor knot.

302
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,004
Oh, I am, am I?

303
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,835
Is that what you think?

304
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,880
Well, if that is
what you think,

305
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,424
I have something to tell you.

306
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,678
Something that may shock
and discredit you.

307
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:09,011
And that thing
is as follows:

308
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,598
I'm not wearing a tie at all.

309
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,354
(gasping)

310
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,685
But if I am wrong about that,

311
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,151
maybe I am wrong
about Mrs. Simpson.

312
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,862
No further questions.

313
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,363
Kids, I got a crazy feeling

314
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,275
your mom's
not going to prison.

315
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,204
(cheering)

316
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,703
You're a latter-day
Clarence Darrow.

317
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,955
Uh, was he the black guy
on "The Mod Squad"?

318
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,288
Mr. Hutz, when I grow up,

319
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,963
I want to be a lawyer
just like you.

320
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,382
Good for you, son.

321
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,710
If there's one thing
America needs,

322
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,416
it's more lawyers.

323
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,716
Can you imagine a world
without lawyers?

324
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,141
♪♪

325
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,100
(shudders)

326
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,181
And so, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury,

327
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,228
I rest my case.

328
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,902
Hmm. Mr. Hutz, do you know
you're not wearing any pants?

329
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,112
What?
(yells)

330
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,529
I move
for a bad court thingy.

331
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,164
You mean a mistrial?

332
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
Yeah. That's why
you're the judge

333
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,236
and I'm the law-talking guy.

334
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,908
-The lawyer.
-Right.

335
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,326
The foreman will pass the
verdict to the bailiff.

336
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,838
This verdict is written
on a cocktail napkin.

337
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,711
And it still says "guilty."

338
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,877
-And "guilty" is spelled wrong.
-Eep.

339
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,847
Will the foreman please
read the real verdict?

340
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,929
We find the defendant guilty.

341
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,599
Marge Simpson,

342
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,193
I sentence you to
30 days in prison.

343
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,859
Next case, the National
Council of Churches

344
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,859
v. Lionel Hutz.

345
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,111
Oh, right. That thing.

346
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,493
(weeping)

347
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,449
You're still
my hero, Mom.

348
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,949
Now you kids be good
while mother's in prison.

349
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,203
Don't worry, Mom.

350
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,914
I'll bust you out of there

351
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,834
just as soon as I get
a cocktail dress and a crowbar.

352
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,962
Bartina, until I met you,

353
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:06,085
I was the loneliest warden
in the penal system.

354
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,723
Fresh.

355
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,635
Oh... down I go.

356
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,138
(chuckles)

357
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,136
I'll be fine, dear.

358
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,268
Marge, I'm going
to miss you so much,

359
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,475
and it's not
just the sex.

360
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,395
It's also
the food preparation,

361
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,534
your skill with stains
of all kinds,

362
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,372
but mostly I'll miss
how lucky you make me feel

363
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,868
each and every morning.

364
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,290
I'll miss you, too, Homie.

365
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,922
With her behind bars,
our store is secure.

366
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:42,961
(air brakes releasing)

367
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,423
(diesel engine running)

368
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,224
I'm taking this
thing to Mexico.

369
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,800
(laughing)

370
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,937
Knock, knock.

371
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,026
I'm Marge Simpson,
your new cellmate.

372
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,362
I'm Phillips.

373
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,907
They call me that
'cause I killed my husband

374
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,580
with a Phillips head
screwdriver.

375
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,738
Hmm.

376
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,867
It's so nice
not to have to cook.

377
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,126
You mean your husband
never cooked for you?

378
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,878
Well, once.

379
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,890
Homer, I don't think
this fish is quite dead yet.

380
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,298
HOMER: Marge, please.

381
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,256
I'm having enough trouble
with the lobsters.

382
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,926
Oh, uh!
D'oh!

383
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,189
Oh, my goodness.

384
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,731
That's Tattoo Annie.

385
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,568
{\an8}(Marge reads tattoo)

386
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,402
Hmm. I don't understand.

387
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,908
It's one of those
Mad Magazine fold-ins.

388
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,618
Amazing.

389
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,413
Now, kids, while
your mother's gone,

390
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,537
I don't want to have
to wash any dishes,

391
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,794
so from now on drink straight
from the faucet or milk carton,

392
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,457
and we'll eat while standing
over the sink or toilet.

393
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,796
Who's gonna change Maggie?

394
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,221
We're gonna let her
roam free in the backyard,

395
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,050
and nature will take
its course.

396
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,135
Excuse me, but I think
if we all do our fair share

397
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,062
we can keep
this house clean.

398
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:22,885
{\an8}(yowling)

399
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,266
{\an8}(crashing)

400
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,814
(growling)

401
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,977
Dad, we're running out
of clean clothes.

402
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,317
It seems like I've been wearing
this same red dress forever.

403
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,823
HOMER:
Go up to the attic.

404
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,655
There's a whole trunk
of clothes up there.

405
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,200
(humming "Bridal March")

406
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,785
All right!
Bologna and cheese!

407
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,251
What do you got, Bart?

408
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,711
Pack of sugar,

409
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,211
and peanut butter smeared
on a playing card.

410
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,553
Ha-ha! Your mom's
a jailbird.

411
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,630
So's yours.

412
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,764
Oh, yeah.
Let's play.

413
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,724
LISA: Oh, Mom,
I've missed you so much.

414
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,188
Oh, honey,
I've missed you too.

415
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,399
Homer, is that
an old Halloween costume?

416
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,900
Uh...

417
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,072
no.

418
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,030
So, how are things at home?

419
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,781
We flushed a gator
down the toilet,

420
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,073
but it got stuck halfway,
and now we have to feed it.

421
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,157
I'll bet you want
a piece of me.

422
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,493
Well, you ain't
going to get it.

423
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,828
See? Ha-ha-ha!

424
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,673
Oh...

425
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,538
Hey!

426
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,134
Gosh darn it.

427
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:36,094
HOMER: Honey, I don't know
what you're feeling right now,

428
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,385
so I don't want
to push anything.

429
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,848
We can just hold hands
or sit and talk.

430
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,140
(growling)

431
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,015
(Homer yells)

432
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,896
Oh, do you have any of those
delicious marshmallow squares?

433
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,282
Sorry, Marge Simpson
makes those.

434
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,069
-Oh, darn.
-(everyone sighs)

435
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,485
$15 short.

436
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:04,494
Exactly what Marge Simpson's
marshmallow squares bring in.

437
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,868
Can we still afford
that statue of Lincoln?

438
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,115
No, I'm afraid we'll have to
go with something cheaper.

439
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,288
Eh.

440
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,415
I, uh, give you
our 39th president...

441
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,303
Jimmy Carter.

442
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,590
Oh, come on.

443
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,093
He's history's
greatest monster.

444
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,756
(angry yelling)

445
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,819
Release the dogs.

446
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,782
Gee, they look pretty mad.

447
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,282
Yeah, I've been
starving 'em, teasing 'em,

448
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,525
singing off-key.

449
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,116
(singing off-key)

450
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,212
(screaming)
No, no, no! Nice doggie!

451
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,708
This never would
have happened

452
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,630
if Marge Simpson
was here.

453
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,093
Good-bye, Marge.

454
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,222
I'll miss you.

455
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,088
I hope you find
somebody.

456
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:03,215
Men are such slime,
but I'm seeing this new guy.

457
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,603
I think he's different.

458
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,930
Yoo-hoo!
(belches)

459
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,805
He says his name is Homer,

460
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,022
and he works
at the nuclear plant.

461
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,693
Oh...

462
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,401
We've got to clean this up
before Mom gets back.

463
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,862
No problemo.

464
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,692
We'll just sweep it
all under the rug.

465
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,737
(rumbling)

466
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,911
(crunching and cracking)

467
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,834
MAN: Hey, watch it.

468
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,247
(cheering and applause)

469
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,884
I didn't expect all this.

470
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,512
Well, we never
should have let you go.

471
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,758
From now on I'll use
my gossip for good

472
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,051
instead of evil.

473
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,394
Three cheers for Marge Simpson.

we have a special
