1
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:08,775
Dick Gregory, everyone.

2
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:09,810
What a lineup,

3
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:11,812
but before we see George Carlin,

4
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,580
Albert Brooks,
and Richard Pryor,

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,283
give it up for a new comic,
who I'm sure is just as edgy

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,051
and scathingly intelligent,

7
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,387
Krusty the Clown.

8
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,422
Hey, hey.

9
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:23,357
So, uh,

10
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,425
sports are in the news,
am I right?

11
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,861
And the biggest game
of them all is...

12
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:30,931
the Super Bowl.

13
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,502
How is your comedy
ending the war?

14
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:51,752
Even a hack's got to eat.

15
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,254
Uh, welcome to
Worth-A-Try Burger.

16
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:57,224
We know you have a lot of other
choices to eat in this town,

17
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,226
and-and many of them
are excellent.

18
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,994
Yeah, yeah,
just knock on the can

19
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,930
when my burger's ready.

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,131
Here you go.

21
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:05,999
Whoa, that was fast,

22
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,702
the most important factor
in a good food experience.

23
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,939
That's thanks to this beauty,
the Triple Patty Flipper,

24
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,907
invented by me
and my partner here.

25
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:16,510
It speeds up
the cook-time threefold.

26
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:19,546
But business
has been a little slow,

27
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,548
even with our new radio ad.

28
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:34,995
Geez.

29
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:37,598
You're the most modest
businessmen I ever met.

30
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,499
Oh, gosh, no.

31
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,035
I'm sure there's people
much more modest than us.

32
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:45,606
You schmendricks got to
triple-flip that loser attitude.

33
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,207
This place could be huge.

34
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,177
If you just had some shameless
schmendrick to promote it,

35
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:53,146
who knows what
the future could hold.

36
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,818
Hey, hey. It's Krusty Burger's
50th anniversary,

37
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,854
and I want you
to celebrate with me

38
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,089
at Krusty Fest.

39
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,725
Meet all your favorite
Krustyland characters

40
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,959
from the good old days.

41
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,528
Burger Reynolds.

42
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,929
Grilly Cheese King.

43
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,531
Jack Pickleson.

44
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,699
Patty Meltin' John.

45
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,068
Patty Meltin' John.

46
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:18,338
I remember when he sang
at Princess Fries' funeral.

47
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:21,041
And we got hamburgers
at the original price

48
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,110
of 25 cents!

49
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,179
Marge, cancel that trip
you booked a year ago

50
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,623
to the
Holland Michigan Tulip Days.

51
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:30,450
We're going to a cheap
hamburger festival!

52
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,365
Whoa, Me and the Space Clown.

53
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,135
They're showing the only copy
that's not in a landfill.

54
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,704
Don't die, Space Clown.

55
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,673
I love you.

56
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,042
Only one thing can save me now:

57
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,244
Every kid out there needs to buy

58
00:02:57,311 --> 00:03:00,280
a Mega-sized Krusty meal.

59
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,481
Full price.

60
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,918
Money is my oxygen.

61
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:09,923
It's working.

62
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,960
The stupid kids fell for it!

63
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,732
Lisa, I got you one with a patty

64
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,068
that's 100% veggie.

65
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,170
Yeah, the burgers
never had actual meat,

66
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:26,306
but somehow the sodas do.

67
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,176
I swore I'd never eat
a hamburger sandwich

68
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:30,911
made by that clown.

69
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,880
I got my reasons.

70
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,916
Oh, Abe, you and your reasons.

71
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,419
I'm sorry you're upset,

72
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,222
but it's nice to have someone
to be a little grumpy with.

73
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,056
Yup,

74
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,058
we've always had a special.

75
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,394
Grampa-Lisa connection.

76
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,396
You know, we do.

77
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,498
I call it "Grampsa."

78
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,636
Oh, that's why you always
say that.

79
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,210
One pillowcase worth of
25-cent Krusty burgers, please.

80
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,312
How are you gonna carry
all these burgers?

81
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,681
Pillowcase full of pillowcases.

82
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:12,619
Boy, I finally have something
to pass onto you,

83
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,088
cheeseburger-ational wealth.

84
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:17,124
I've never loved you more.

85
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:19,126
Well, at least they're
having a good time.

86
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:20,460
It'll never last.

87
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:23,130
Every time a Simpson
thinks he's got it made,

88
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:26,099
life comes along
and slaps us silly.

89
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,268
It's a curse, I tells you.

90
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,070
Burger hawks!

91
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,940
Punch them in the beaks.

92
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:36,429
- Get out of here!
- Go away!

93
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,913
Eh, the Simpson curse.

94
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:43,183
Oh, yeah, I love caviar.

95
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:45,986
Oh, so many fish

96
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:49,089
that'll never be fish. Mmm.

97
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:51,792
- Krusty.
- Mm?

98
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,760
I'm Augustus Redfield,

99
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,096
chairman of
the RedStar Corporation.

100
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,276
Yeah, yeah, hey, hey.
Sarah, get this yutz a headshot

101
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:00,634
and sign it from me
"with warm regards."

102
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,036
I'm here to destroy you

103
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,138
for what you did to me.

104
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,940
Change that to
"regular regards."

105
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,176
Who the hell
do you think you are?!

106
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:12,379
Hey, it's you.

107
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:15,148
Worth-A-Try Burger, right?
You doing good?

108
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:18,652
I'm the ninth richest man
in the world now.

109
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:21,021
Okay, warmest regards.

110
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:24,491
You stole my restaurant
50 years ago.

111
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:27,794
I plotted and waited
until your moment of triumph

112
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:29,162
to tell you this:

113
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:31,698
I just bought your
parent company,

114
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:34,067
and you're finished.

115
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,604
You are immediately fired
from Krusty Burger,

116
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,140
The Krusty the Clown Show,
and Krusty Enterprises.

117
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,643
You can no longer call yourself
"Krusty the Clown,".

118
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,278
"Krusty," or "Clown,"

119
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,047
and we own all
your slide whistle noises.

120
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:51,418
You think you got me,
huh, big shot?

121
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,854
Well, let's see
what my loyal fans

122
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,322
think about that.

123
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,892
Attention,
me-worshipping nobodies,

124
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,527
I am the victim of a coup.

125
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:03,397
This evil billionaire
just stabbed me in the back!

126
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,333
We love you, Krusty!

127
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:09,603
All burgers are now 24 cents.

128
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,638
Let our new hero speak!

129
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,110
Hand over your side hair.

130
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:20,647
And the top knot.

131
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:25,485
I finally have what any
billionaire businessman wants,

132
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,020
total revenge

133
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,356
on the clown
who stole his dream.

134
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,959
I only wish that
I could share this moment

135
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:35,195
with my dear old partner
from Worth-A-Try Burger,

136
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,464
who helped me launch that dream

137
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:38,932
50 years ago.

138
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,635
Old partner? That's me.

139
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:43,337
No, it's not, Dad.

140
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:44,705
Nothing is you.

141
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:47,341
Abe Simpson, it is you.

142
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,376
It is. Oh...

143
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,920
My old friend,

144
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,823
I am about to change your life.

145
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,625
Dad, it's not you!

146
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:11,064
Hey, hey, kids. These burgers
are "Worth a try."

147
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,499
And don't forget

148
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:13,767
the fries.

149
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:19,973
Wow, look at that crowd.

150
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,409
Who would've thought a clown
could sell hamburgers?

151
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,478
This Krusty guy
falling into our laps

152
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:27,147
is the best thing that ever
could've happened to us.

153
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:29,249
Give me more cash.

154
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,952
But we already cut you in
for a third of the business.

155
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,921
Without me,
there is no business.

156
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:36,723
I finally found
my true purpose as an artist,

157
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,926
selling cheap meat to fat kids.

158
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:41,161
Now give me half, or I walk.

159
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,064
Come on, what's it gonna be?

160
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,702
Tough banana skins.

161
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,804
And now to never regret this.

162
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:53,607
Welcome to Krusty Burger!

163
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,142
Yay!

164
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,110
And the burgers
come faster than ever,

165
00:07:57,244 --> 00:08:00,781
thanks to my patented
"Krusty Triple Flopper."

166
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:02,182
We knew he stole jokes,

167
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,985
but entire casual dining
business plans?

168
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,421
Well, Abe, the way I see it,
when you get screwed over,

169
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:10,357
there are two things you can do:
Give up or fight.

170
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,927
I'm a fighter, and I don't care
how long it takes,

171
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,463
I'm gonna get revenge
on that clown.

172
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,731
Are you with me?

173
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,238
I never let myself
get stepped on again.

174
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,039
I ruthlessly built an empire

175
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,642
till I was rich enough
to ruin Krusty

176
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,043
and own six cable networks,

177
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,612
several deep-sea diamond mines,

178
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,881
and a company that makes
three-wheeled motorcycles

179
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,616
for old weirdos.

180
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:40,454
Abe, now that I've got
our burger business back,

181
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,389
I need you by my side.

182
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:45,659
I want you to sit
on my board of directors.

183
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:48,061
Grampa, you love sitting.

184
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:51,365
The board is meeting
in New York on Monday.

185
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,773
Wow, Dad, now you can be
a Republican

186
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,113
because you're rich and greedy,

187
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,409
and not because you're old

188
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,143
and don't know how
to change the channel.

189
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:07,915
But what if I blow it?
Like I did all those years ago.

190
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:09,950
That's the Simpson curse.

191
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,719
But this time, you've got
a brilliant businessman

192
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:13,987
like Gus on your side.

193
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,956
You can break the curse.

194
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:18,225
Okay, honey, I'll do it,

195
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,460
but only if you come with me.

196
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:21,795
- Me?
- Yeah.

197
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:24,565
I can't do this
without "Grampsa."

198
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,733
Oh, then I'm in.

199
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:28,335
Dad, since you've got
a rich friend,

200
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,070
what about our special bond?

201
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:32,372
What about "Gromer"?

202
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:33,574
"Hampa"?

203
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:35,742
What about "Abe-Ho"?

204
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:38,378
Is that a bond? Is it?

205
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:37,905
You've got to be pretty classy

206
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,573
to show off this much.

207
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,475
Come, meet my family.

208
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,845
Let's find out who
my favorite child is today.

209
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:46,780
What have you done
for the Redfield empire?

210
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:49,516
Dad, I'm gonna start a religion

211
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,051
where you're the Jesus.

212
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,986
Think of the tax implications.

213
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,288
Please, please, think of them.

214
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:57,591
Dad, as we speak,
there are 10,000 influencers

215
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,793
at my island music festival.

216
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,428
Too bad the bands
haven't shown up,

217
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:04,264
and there's no food, toilets,
or ways off the island.

218
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,600
No biggie, nobody died.

219
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,604
Well, nobody famous died.

220
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,207
Okay, I hope none of you
like Kenny Chesney.

221
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:15,843
Daddy, thanks
for putting me in charge

222
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,044
of R&D.

223
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,213
Hey, R&D's my job.

224
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,014
It's research and development,

225
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,217
not racecars
and downward spiraling.

226
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:26,720
My therapist says my rock bottom
belongs to me.

227
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,090
And now, it's dinnertime.

228
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:33,727
To be made by the original
Worth-A-Try partners, at...

229
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:38,031
Our old stand.

230
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:48,242
Lisa, why don't we get
some fresh air?

231
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:50,310
Are you enjoying the valley?

232
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,180
Because we could totally
change it to Mount Everest.

233
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:56,550
Well, we already rode them
down the Giza pyramid

234
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:57,951
and up the Burj Khalifa.

235
00:11:58,018 --> 00:12:00,587
Yes, let's head back
to the stables.

236
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,928
Oh, wheatgrass.

237
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:09,663
No, that's for the horses.

238
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:13,400
Oh, phew. I've been pretending
to like it for years.

239
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,069
My dad has done nothing
but ruthlessly build

240
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:17,871
his empire for decades,

241
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,973
but flipping burgers
with your grandpa

242
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,742
was the first time

243
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,510
I've ever seen him at peace.

244
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,012
That's wonderful.

245
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,814
It's terrible.
He's gone soft in the head.

246
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,050
Really? He seems pretty with it.

247
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:33,020
Then why would he give a seat
on the board to a man

248
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,055
who tried to make a phone call

249
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:37,057
with a box of raisins?

250
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,893
Oh, I was hoping
you didn't see that.

251
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,930
Grampa calls the raisins
"phone berries."

252
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,566
But I think this is
a golden opportunity.

253
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,668
Imagine how a progressive,

254
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,536
Earth-loving woman like me

255
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:52,139
could change the course
of this regressive,

256
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,208
Earth-hating company.

257
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,010
Oh, rebranding.

258
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:58,712
And not just performative.

259
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:01,548
For instance, we'd provide

260
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,450
more opportunities for...

261
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:06,486
...polar bears.

262
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,622
They're the only creatures

263
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:10,357
I wish had white privilege.

264
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,458
It's so exciting.

265
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:13,894
My dad is stepping down
and giving control to me.

266
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,329
That's amazing.

267
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:17,497
It's all gonna happen on Monday,

268
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,867
when your grandfather votes
to force him out.

269
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,635
- What?
- Uh...

270
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:23,971
it's my turn in the room.

271
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:31,011
Dad, look what they've
done to Krusty's show.

272
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:32,312
Up-bup-bup. You can't call him

273
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,948
that name anymore,
or we'll get sued.

274
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,052
It's the Herschel
The Comical Man Show.

275
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,956
I'm your announcer, Nothing Mel.

276
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:46,059
And here's a performer
who's not violating

277
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:49,263
any termination agreement
implied or in writing.

278
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,464
Him.

279
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:51,965
Hee-hoo, kids.

280
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:54,234
Say hi to Mr. Teeny-Dog,

281
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,770
who's not affiliated
with Krusty Enterprises,

282
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,873
its designees, or assigns.

283
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:03,844
Haw-haw! You don't control
your own I. P.

284
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,081
That sure drained
the confetti

285
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,750
from his fire bucket.

286
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,086
Dad is losing it,

287
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,889
and what are these "hamburger"
things he's making us eat?

288
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,859
I can't touch food
with my hand skin.

289
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:20,427
Are you sure we've got the votes

290
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,129
to oust him
at the meeting Monday?

291
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:24,164
Don't worry.
I'm just about to seal the deal

292
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:27,000
on my little blonde
insurance policy.

293
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:45,986
This movie is so moving
and didactic.

294
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,354
You made this?

295
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:49,990
Chloé Zhao made it.
I just financed it

296
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,792
and took three different
producer credits.

297
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:53,393
But this is
the kind of messaging

298
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,263
I want my family's company
to put into the world,

299
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,199
but I need you
to convince your grandpa

300
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,401
to vote to give me control
of the board.

301
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:03,103
Oh, yes, but

302
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:06,139
wouldn't Grampa be betraying
his oldest friend?

303
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,476
It would give my dad the sweet
retirement he's earned,

304
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,044
with Abe by his side.

305
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,513
But that's fine, forget it.

306
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,882
We'll just let my company
continue its campaign

307
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:16,884
to sell handguns to dogs.

308
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:19,653
No, no. I'll do it!

309
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:43,944
Lisa, I'm so glad
you made me come here.

310
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:46,013
Who knew having
a purpose in life

311
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:47,981
would give my life purpose?

312
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:49,015
About that,

313
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,951
Sheila's gonna propose a motion,

314
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,786
and I think you should
vote "yes" on it.

315
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:55,022
It'll be a nice thing
for you and Gus.

316
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,057
And great for the world.

317
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,458
Just trust me on this.

318
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,162
Why wouldn't I trust you?
We're Grampsa.

319
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:05,866
Let me take a selfie
of this perfect moment.

320
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:10,003
This meeting of the board
of the RedStar Corporation

321
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,271
will come to order.

322
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,841
Present are
CEO Augustus Redfield,

323
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:16,043
Sheila Redfield, Colby Redfield,

324
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:19,279
Mav Redfield...

325
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,815
Angela Merkel,
the bald, creepy Shark Tank guy,

326
00:16:21,882 --> 00:16:23,817
TikTok superstar
Charli D'Amelio.

327
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:24,985
What do you do?

328
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:26,920
Well, I entertain people
on their phones

329
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,755
while they watch TV.
How about you?

330
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:31,124
I am often the only
voice of reason

331
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:33,360
in all of Europe.

332
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:36,263
Cool. How do you monetize that?

333
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,764
I don't.

334
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,100
And Abraham Simpson.

335
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,236
Welcome, my old friend.

336
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:45,138
I have a motion to introduce.

337
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,674
Daddy, you are
the greatest human

338
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,176
to ever walk the planet.

339
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:51,845
So, I say this out of devotion,

340
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:54,281
respect and pure love.

341
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,250
You're a dinosaur,
and it's time to turn into oil

342
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:57,885
to fuel the next generation.

343
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:59,152
What did you say?

344
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:01,021
This is a vote of no confidence.

345
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,923
Your mind has turned to tapioca.

346
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,392
You are out as CEO, and I'm in.

347
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,661
You're gonna be
Cousin Greg's intern now.

348
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:10,230
All right, so, uh,

349
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:13,100
I mostly just get sandwiches
for the security guards,

350
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,202
but it's more complicated
than it sounds.

351
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:17,738
There's, like,
five kinds of bread now.

352
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,540
This is a nice thing?

353
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:21,108
Oh, it sounded nicer

354
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,744
after our virtual
horseback ride.

355
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:25,746
Do all of you kids
feel this way?

356
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:27,481
Yes, Dad. Right?

357
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:30,050
Um... yeah-o?

358
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,085
Sure, w-why not? Unless, yes.

359
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:35,055
I mean, whatever, it's all good.
Unless it's bad.

360
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:38,425
We have a motion
of no confidence.

361
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:39,693
All in favor?

362
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:41,295
All against?

363
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:48,101
The vote is tied
at three to three.

364
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:50,737
Mr. Simpson,
you're the tiebreaker.

365
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:55,843
I'm gonna do what I didn't do
50 years ago,

366
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:58,445
stick with my old pal Gus.

367
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:00,514
I'm voting "no."

368
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:03,784
Well, all I can say is...

369
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:06,787
My plan worked!

370
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:08,355
I win!

371
00:18:11,992 --> 00:18:14,394
We've been Wonka-ed.

372
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:15,229
What?

373
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,064
You led this coup against me.

374
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:19,399
You're out. You get nothing!

375
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,635
Tell Megan Ellison
she's my daughter now.

376
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:24,004
She'll be there at your
birthday dinner tomorrow night.

377
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:26,106
You voted with her;
You're out, too.

378
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:29,243
I love you, Dad.
You smell so good.

379
00:18:29,343 --> 00:18:32,012
You idiots really think I'd
throw away the company I built

380
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:35,315
to wear a paper hat
with this old fool?

381
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:37,751
Fool?

382
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:39,419
You mean
you only brought me here

383
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,489
to smoke out your
backstabbing children?

384
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:43,657
Don't you see? I had to.

385
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:47,494
I learned 50 years ago that
I'm surrounded by Krustys.

386
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,563
Everywhere, Krustys.

387
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:52,032
Even I am zis Krusty?

388
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,134
But you made it happen, Abe,

389
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:56,236
my sweet loyal pawn.

390
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:59,706
I win because you voted no.

391
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:04,645
Oh, Grampa,
you got stepped on again,

392
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:07,114
and it's all my fault.

393
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:10,450
Hold your horseradish!

394
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,252
When I voted "no,"

395
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:15,422
I was talking about
the Japanese Noh theater,

396
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:19,026
which I saw plenty of when
I was stationed in the Pacific,

397
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:21,895
stranded on a raft
made of Dear John letters

398
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,597
and mermaid hair.

399
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:25,199
I married one of those mermaids,

400
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,501
but she was a reverso,

401
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:29,269
fish head and lady gams.

402
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,506
That,
plus a thousand other things,

403
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:34,641
made me what I am today...

404
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,510
mentally incompetent.

405
00:19:41,148 --> 00:19:45,018
Isn't mental incompetence
grounds for voiding a vote?

406
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:47,788
Well, as the family lawyer
and psychopharmacologist,

407
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:50,324
it certainly is.

408
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:53,093
Abraham Simpson's vote
is nullified.

409
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,196
The count now stands
at three to three... a tie.

410
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,332
We'll be hopelessly deadlocked.

411
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:00,367
The company
will grind to a halt.

412
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:03,370
Eh, tough banana skins.

413
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:15,516
Grampa, you outplayed
a room full of players.

414
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,551
One of whom played me.

415
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,654
I'm so sorry we didn't break
that Simpsons curse.

416
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,322
Eh, nertz to that curse.

417
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,992
Every terrible decision
I made in my life

418
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:28,228
led to me having you
as my granddaughter.

419
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:29,229
So, I say,

420
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:32,633
I'm one pretty lucky old guy.

421
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,986
Herschel, such gorgeous
potatoes I've never seen.

422
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:54,321
Thank you, Nehorai.

423
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:57,224
It feels good to finally find
inner peace.

424
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:02,129
Gus Redfield
was only using Krusty Burger

425
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:05,065
as a pawn
in a bitter family war.

426
00:21:05,132 --> 00:21:06,834
You can have it back

427
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,102
for the price
of the notary fees.

428
00:21:09,203 --> 00:21:11,371
I can be a clown again.

429
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:17,744
He was a clown?

430
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:19,213
He was, like,
the least funny person

431
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,114
on this socialist commune.
