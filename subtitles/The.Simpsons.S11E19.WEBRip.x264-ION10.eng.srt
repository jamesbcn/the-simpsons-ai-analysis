2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:06,509
CHORUS: <i>♪ The Simpsons ♪</i>

3
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,938
(bell ringing)

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,234
(whistle blows)

5
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,283
(beeping)

00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,826
(playing the blues)

7
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,372
(jazzy solo)

8
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,507
(chimes)

00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:53,971
(tires screeching)

10
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,852
(honking horn)

11
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,524
D'oh!

12
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,607
(screams)

13
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,821
(tires screeching)

14
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,114
ALL: Ah, ah, ooh, ooh...

15
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,855
Ah, ah, ooh, ooh. Hmm!

16
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,593
{\an8}Here's the mail, Dad. That'll be
three dollars for on-couch delivery.

17
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,586
{\an8}And three makes three.

18
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,175
{\an8}This isn't real money. It's printed
by the Montana Militia.

19
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,969
{\an8}It'll be real soon enough.

20
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,965
Ooh, my first issue of <i>Self-test Monthly </i>.

21
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,386
Finally I get to find out
what makes me tick.

22
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,015
{\an8}-I'm betting it's hunger and rage.
-Yeah, but in what ratio?

23
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,979
{\an8}"Are you a good driver?" Hmm. Yes.

24
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,565
{\an8}"Are you a good lover?"

25
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,654
{\an8}Yes. Oh, I'm doing great.

26
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,566
{\an8}Dad, those are just
the names of the quizzes.

27
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,405
{\an8}You're supposed to open the magazine.

28
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,490
{\an8}My way is easier.

29
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,204
{\an8}Why don't you be the quiz master

30
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,204
{\an8}and ask other people the questions?

31
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,916
{\an8}Ooh... Quiz master, yes.
That would entertain me briefly.

32
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:08,248
{\an8}OK, Flanders,
your love quiz score is... 61.

33
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,416
{\an8}That makes you a "Frigid Frieda."

34
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,545
{\an8}I took off 30 points
for all that crying you did.

35
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,893
{\an8}(sniffling) Well, it was
a little insensitive giving me a sex test

36
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,761
{\an8}seeing that my wife just passed away.

37
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,478
{\an8}-No way! When?
-Six months ago.

38
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,349
{\an8}You were at the funeral.
You fell into the grave.

39
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,936
{\an8}(chuckles) Oh, yeah.

40
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,271
{\an8}I saw a gopher. What a day.

41
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,647
{\an8}-(crow caws)
-OK... last question.

42
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,275
{\an8}"Who is your favorite Backstreet Boy?"

43
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,698
{\an8}Oh, the little rat-faced one.

44
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,451
{\an8}No, no, no. Nick.

45
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,333
{\an8}He's so good to his mother.

46
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,500
{\an8}According to this, you're both idiots.

47
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,539
{\an8}Hey, thanks. What do we owe you?

48
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,789
{\an8}OK, "There's black widow at your door,

49
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:52,127
{\an8}a rattlesnake at the window
and a scorpion on the phone.

50
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,263
{\an8}Do you... A, none of the below,
B..."

51
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,431
{\an8}Homie, for God's sakes, it's 02:00 a.m.

52
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,601
{\an8}Fine. I'll take the next quiz.

53
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,178
{\an8}"How long will you live?"

54
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,267
{\an8}"In an average week, how many braised ribs
do you eat?"

55
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,563
Marge, do you think
that counts honey-braised?

56
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,267
MARGE: I don't know!

57
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,777
I'm trying to sleep!

58
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:19,865
OK... "non-smoker... add eight years."

59
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:20,949
Hmm.

60
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,414
So according to this, I'll live to be...

61
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:27,334
Forty-two? Oh, that's horrible!

62
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:31,085
I won't even live to see my children die.

63
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,919
(sobbing)

64
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,264
Now what's wrong?

65
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,130
I've only got three more years to live.

66
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,348
Maybe you added it wrong. Let me have it.

67
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,809
(mumbling)

68
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,520
See? And these quizzes
are never wrong, Marge.

69
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,481
They're put together
by the finest scientists

70
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,401
in the magazine business.

71
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,230
Oh... Honey, don't panic.

72
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,026
If you just made a few
lifestyle changes...

73
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,780
No! (sobbing)

74
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,945
Can't sleep. Gonna die.

75
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,790
Can't sleep. Gonna die.

76
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,921
<i>We're back with legendary</i>
<i>producer, Robert Evans.</i>

77
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:12,038
<i>Now before you did </i>The Godfather
<i>there was </i>Love Story <i>.</i>

78
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:15,046
<i>-Tell us about that.</i>
<i>-Ah, </i>Love Story...

79
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,709
<i>The little picture that could.</i>

80
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,878
<i>Was Paramount chomping</i>
<i>at the bit to make it?</i>

81
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,967
(chuckles) <i>You better believe</i>
<i>they weren't.</i>

82
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,262
<i>But once that tear-jerker</i>
<i>hit John Q. Popcorn,</i>

83
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,096
<i>it was boffo, boo-hoo box office</i>
<i>all the way. </i>(chuckles)

84
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,732
<i>And the critics loved it, too.</i>

85
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,939
<i>I remember Vincent Canby said...</i>

86
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,099
<i>"I'm going to kill you, Homer."</i>

87
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,936
<i>-You are so dead.</i>
-(shrieks)

88
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,193
Now, <i>Chinatown </i>was a classic.

89
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,896
But you had problems
with the sequel <i>The Two Jakes?</i>

90
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,857
Oh, boy, disappointed?

91
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,697
I had the blues like Chasen's had chili.
I said to myself...

92
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,793
"Evans, you forgot
Hollywood rule number one...

93
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,750
-Kill Homer Simpson."
-(shrieks)

94
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,082
Hey, what's all the screaming?

95
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,706
Some of us have grammar school
in the morning, you know.

96
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,674
Maybe you should see a doctor, Homie.
A head doctor.

97
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,675
I'm not crazy. It's the TV that's crazy!

98
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,138
Aren't you, TV?

99
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,718
The crisis? Charlie Bludorn's birthday.

100
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,814
The solution? A snappy banner.

101
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,179
Out comes the phone, in flies Bobby Towne

102
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,387
and six drafts later,
I had myself a party.

103
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,977
You see? Gibberish. All gibberish.

104
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:16,766
(crow caws)

105
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,438
So tell me,
are all you government inspectors

106
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,197
so handsome and strapping?

107
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,659
Well, we've got a solo flex down at HQ.

108
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,080
Anyway, everything looks great, Mr. Burns.

109
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,949
I can't find a single violation
or employee acting strangely.

110
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,287
You got to hide me! Death is after me!

111
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,745
And I don't entirely trust these cowboys.

112
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,376
Is this man an employee?

113
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,303
Oh, of course not. He's just...

114
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:46,302
a harmless maniac here to remind us
of the precious gift of sanity.

115
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,927
(sputtering) Oh, God, what's he doing?

116
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,139
That's it, that's it. A mother can't die.

117
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,897
And I'm a mother, see?

118
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,728
(nervous Laughing)

119
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,355
(Homer whimpering)

120
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,452
-You hate your father, don't you?
-Sometimes.

121
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,568
But the guy I really hate is your father.

122
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,373
I shouldn't have brought that up.
I was just venting.

123
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,000
Any-hoo, I think your fear
of death is causing your insomnia

124
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,289
which is provoking your erratic behavior.

125
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,543
Why isn't my baby gaining weight?

126
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,535
-Because it's made of plastic.
-I see.

127
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,128
What you need is a good, long rest.

128
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,554
-I suggest Florida.
-Florida?

129
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,473
{\an8}But that's America's wang.

130
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,051
{\an8}They prefer "The sunshine state."

131
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,221
Mom, Bart's sitting next to me.

132
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,517
-Mom, Lisa's growing.
-Quiet, you two.

133
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,941
You know your father's had a breakdown.

134
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,440
{\an8}My pockets hurt.

135
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,232
OK, honey, we're almost to Palm Corners.

136
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:43,396
There'll be nothing to do
but lie on the beach and relax.

137
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,742
(chattering, cheering)

138
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:47,873
(tires squeal)

139
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,907
(crowd chanting) Spring break,
spring break, spring break...

140
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,247
Oh, no. We came during spring break.

141
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,791
(gasps)

142
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,504
Take them off the glass!

143
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,294
Take them off the glass!

144
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,048
This looks like a terrible place to relax.

145
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,091
We're going to get you to a... (gasps)

146
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,634
-(Homer Laughing)
-(cheering)

147
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,340
(grunting)

148
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:10,887
(groans)

149
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,602
Party! Woo-hoo!

150
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:18,272
♪ <i>Hey, boys it's the wild weekend </i>♪

151
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:22,436
{\an8}<i>♪ We did it then and we'll do it again ♪</i>

152
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,525
<i>♪ We're having fun</i>
<i>and we just got started ♪</i>

153
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,821
(music fades out)

154
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,870
This is terrible.

155
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,118
The whole point of coming down here

156
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,949
was for you to get some rest.

157
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,454
-Show us your boobs!
-Not now.

158
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,577
(Home yawns)

159
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,673
Well... (yawns) enjoy your sightseeing.

160
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,249
I promise I won't leave this bed.

161
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,085
I trust you, honey.

162
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,877
Sweet dreams.

163
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,971
HOMER: Uh... could you just shut off the--

164
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,102
Party! Party! Party!

165
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,524
Party! Party!

166
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,154
Party?

167
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,320
Now, this is living.

168
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,370
Whoo! Sepulveda here doing a veejay thing

169
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,001
for the most out-of-control
spring break ever!

170
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,748
And since it's my birthday,
we'll party extra hard.

171
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,751
(beeping)

172
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:23,592
(gasps) No. Not yet. I'm only 25.

173
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,545
(grunting)

174
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,050
What up, chew toys? Cienega here...

175
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,512
tightening the hose clamps
for you bad girls.

176
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,393
We got Kid Rock coming up
for all you mosh monkeys.

177
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,351
Woo! I like music!

178
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,936
Yo, yo, straight out of Detroit, y'all.

179
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,190
It's the J-O-E to the C.

180
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,942
Let's rock the party with Kid Rock.

181
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,435
Oh, no. It's a lost child.

182
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,147
Don't worry, folks... I'll tackle him.

183
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,277

184
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,659
(rock music playing)

185
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,663
Yo, Rock, tell spring break
what your name is.

186
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,380
My name is Ki...

187
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,589

00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,470
And if you look to your left,

192
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,894
you'll see another endless
stretch of stagnant water.

193
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,734
Oh, well, look who turned out
to greet us, folks.

194
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,690
It's our town's most famous
resident, Captain Jack.

195
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,479
Look at the size of that gator.

196
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,527
-Is he a man-eater?
-Only convicts and hobos.

197
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,111
Do you have any hobo chunks
we could throw to him?

198
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,696
(chuckles) Afraid not.

199
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,661
Now, years ago, Captain Jack
helped build Palm Corners

200
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,162
by dragging sticks and stones
from the swamps.

201
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,615
Legend has it, he designed the town flag.

202
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,750
Say hello, Captain Jack.

203
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,129
ALL: Aww...

204
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,837
Ah. He can crawl up
through my toilet any day.

205
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,175
(raucous cheers)

206
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,351
Thank you!

207
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,889
It's the pimp of the nation

208
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,232
Kid Rock tearin' it up
at spring break, y'all.

209
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,899
Now, what we'd like to do next
is bring it down for a minute.

210
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,059
HOMER: Bring on the rappin' granny!

211
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,108
MAN: What?

212
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,320
What? She's hilarious.

213
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,151
You know, a lot of my homies
didn't make it to the party

214
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:17,447
and we're gonna give props
to the fallen by pourin' a 40 on the curb.

215
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,123
(reverent murmuring)

216
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,291
But this ain't no 40-ounce curb.

217
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,460
So we're going to need 40 gallons, y'all.

218
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,039
(cheering)

219
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,705
-All for Homer.
-(crowd booing)

220
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,504
All for Homer.

221
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,258
-What the...
-Hey, who's that fool?

222
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,430
Yo, let's waste that biatch.

223

229
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,320
All right now, boys, that's enough.

230
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,993
Kid Rock, that's not like you.

231
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,542

No, sir. Please don't tell Mama.

They called you a pig, sheriff.

235
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,207
Well, I don't care what they call me

236
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,587
as long as they play "Fists of Rage."

237
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,005
That's a good song. (laughs)

238

239
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,979
Oh, thank goodness. Where were you?

240
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,559
Guess how many boobs I saw today, Marge.

241
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,896
Fifteen.

242
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,860

243
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,070
Ohh! I hope he didn't cause
too much trouble, sheriff.

244
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,741
Oh, boys will be boys.

245
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,490
I reckon he was just
blowing off a little steam.

246
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,201

00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,962

250
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,456
I'm sane again.

251
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,756

Spring break is over.
It's time to get back to our studies.

the college students, for leadership.

Fine. Be nerds.

260
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,151

the beer companies pay me

Yeah. But first, I talked to the engineer.

for dealing with events of this nature.

-Not really. No.

00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,572
I like that. You're hired.

348
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,244
-Woo-hoo!
-Hey, keep it down.

349
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,623
Y'all can stay in this trailer.

350
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,332
-Now, it ain't Buckingham palace...
-Ohh...

351
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,123
But I raised eight young 'uns,
three chill-uns and a baby here.

352
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,626
-(electricity crackling)
-LISA: Eww...

353
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,960
Oh, it's so cozy.

354
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,086
You're insincere. I like that.

355
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,343
(country music playing)

356
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,060
-Can I top you off, hon?
-No, thanks.

357
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:00,271
-More hash browns, sugar?
-No, I'm good.

358
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,231
ANNOUNCER: <i>This just in...</i>

359
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,823
<i>Authorities in Six-Toe County</i>

360
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,399
<i>for a family of fugitives.</i>

361
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,284
<i>-They're charged with Gatorcide...</i>
-(gasps)

362
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,741
<i>...and defrauding an Amtrak snack bar.</i>

363
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,492
Trouble with the law, huh?

364
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,487
Well, I'm not one to judge.

365
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,826
The way I see it,
we're all sinners, and...

366
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,672
(humming)

367
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:25,129
Y'all just lie low here.
You'll be safe with ol' Velma.

368
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,500
-Stop that!
-But I was just--

369
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,877
-Scat!
-Going to try to--

370
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,593
-Go on now! Just quit.
-Knock you out.

371
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,465
<i>♪ Jimmy crack corn and I don't care ♪</i>

372
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,721

375
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,645
Wow! Look at all
the stars you can see here.

376
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,769
Those noxious gasses from the swamp
must magnify them.

377
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,397
I'm getting used to this country life.

378
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,494
Teacher says I'm whittling
at a tenth-grade level.

379
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,779
And y'all hardly ever bicker anymore.

380
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,453
Too hot to bicker, I reckon.

381
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,331
You know, killing that gator

382
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,198
was the best decision I ever made.

383
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,745
-Got that right.
-Darn tootin'.

384
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:00,788
Boy, howdy.

385
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,251
Yep, this place is great.

386
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:07,212
Someday, when Lisa and Bart get married,
it'll all be theirs.

387
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,174
-BOTH: Yuck!
-You mean, when they marry other people.

388
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,295
OK, but I ain't paying for two weddings.

389
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,932
(all snoring)

390
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,430
-(car engine starting)
-(yawns) Hey, wake up! We're moving.

391
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,635
(siren wailing)

392
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,352
You just relax.

393
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,935
I'll have you in jail by supper time.

394
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,110
You'd better.

395
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,068
Hey, you're stealing my trailer!

396
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,730
I like that.

397
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,357
(gravel bangs)

398
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,903
Well, first up is

399
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,816
<i>The state of Florida</i>
<i>vs. The Simpson family.</i>

400
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,866
Your honor, I'd like to represent myself.

401
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,537
Drunken hicks of the jury...

402
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,661
(gasps)

403
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,423
(clanking)

404
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,380
(grunting)

405
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,716
We'd be much better rock breakers

406
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,053
if we weren't all chained together.

407
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,098
-(whip snaps)
-Ow!

408
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,600
No talking.

409
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,892
You know, you catch more flies
with honey than with vinegar.

410
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,227
Ow! I'm beginning to dislike
the man with the whip.

411
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,313
(siren wails)

412
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,150
Afternoon, folks.
Got a new assignment for you.

413
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,526
The judge is having a little soiree
and he needs some help.

414
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,784
-Ow!
-No listening.

415
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,197
You hear me?

416
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,155
Uh... No.

417
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,205
-OFFICER: You just don't learn, do you?
-Ow!

418
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,251
(crowd chattering)

419
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,312
Champagne, madam?

420
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,019
-(whip snaps)
-Ow! Son of a...

421
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,349
-And the gentleman?
-Damn it!

422
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,555
Simpson, we got a problem.

423
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,194
The jazz pianist didn't show up.

424
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,731
Well, what am I supposed to do?

425
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,404
(off-key )

426
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,732
(groaning)

427
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,857
Ow!

428
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,823
(playing beautifully)

429
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,275
OK, Bart, I'll sweet talk the sheriff

430
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,575
while you grab his keys.

431
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,698
What should I do?

432
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,414
Restock the possum bar.

433
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,044
-We're almost out of claws.
-Oh...

434
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,831
My goodness!

435
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,205
What a lovely suit, Sheriff!
Is that Seersucker?

436
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,503
Nah. Not on a civil servant's
salary. It's Nearsucker.

437
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,668
Well, the fabric really brings
out the red in your neck.

438
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,258
Yep. It's coming along, huh?

439
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,013
You should see it in August
after the horseflies been getting at it.

440
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:22,925
Hoo, man!

441
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:27,563
Dang, I wish I could, but in August
our chain gang has to dig for tar.

442
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:33,153
Well, now, I might could switch you to
dead animal pickup.

443
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,572
-Hey!
-Run!

444
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,819
(panting)

445
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,081
Huh? (groaning)

446
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:45,908
(whimpering)

447
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,749
-Hey.
-Ooh.

448
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:53,245
Nice try. I guess we just haven't been
whipping you enough.

449
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,997
-(Whimpers)
-Sake's alive!

450
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,720
(growls)

451
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,589
Our beloved Captain Jack
isn't dead after all!

452
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,467
(excited murmuring)

453
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,314
Well, don't that beat all!

454
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,350
I guess you folks just stunned him.

455
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,853
That's what we've been trying to tell you.

456
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,107
Well, looks like you folks are free to go.

457
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,649
But don't you set foot
in the state of Florida again.

458
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:19,193
Fine, there are plenty of other states

459
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,778
that are happy to have us.

460
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:27,581
Well, we're still welcome
in North Dakota and... Arizona.

461
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,541
Arizona smells funny.

462
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,661
(groans)

463
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,793
North Dakota, here we come!

464
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,915
I've always wanted to see Mount Rushmore.

465
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,303
That's South Dakota.

466
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,669
Oh.

467
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,045
