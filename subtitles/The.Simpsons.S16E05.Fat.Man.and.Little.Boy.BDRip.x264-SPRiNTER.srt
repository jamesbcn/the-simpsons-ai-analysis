Sweetie, that's orphan talk.

345
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,248
(GRUNTING)

346
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,242
Stupid atomic pile.
How hard could it be
to build a reactor?

347
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,081
Korea did it. And look
at the quality of
their animation.

348
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,321
Hmm.

349
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,448
What to do?
What to do?

350
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,089
Hey, maybe the Internet
has the information I need.

351
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,966
It certainly answered
a lot of my questions
about wang enhancement.

352
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,529
www.nuclearsecrets.com

353
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,288
"Are you a terrorist?" No.

354
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,488
"Would you like to
meet someone special

355
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,568
"but are tired
of the bar scene?"

356
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,883
No! I will never
tire of the bar scene!

357
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,964
Let's see. I can make that.

358
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,726
You can get that
by smashing open a golf ball.

359
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,371
That you can find
in any player piano.

360
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,205
All I need is some plutonium.

361
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,844
And I know just
the place to get it!

362
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,928
(CHUCKLES) Mmm.

363
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,327
Dad?

364
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,561
Hub-bub-bub-bub-bub.
Don't look!

365
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,888
Dad, what did you do?

366
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,248
Sweetie,
your daddy's gonna show you
just how much he loves you.

367
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,403
You know that non-functioning
nuclear reactor you built?

368
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,681
Yes...

369
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,603
ljuiced it up a little.
(GIGGLES)

370
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,969
Dad, that could explode!

371
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,565
Oh, that's ridiculous.

372
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,885
(BEEPING)

373
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,282
<i>KRUSTY:
That thing's gonna blow!
Drop this toy and run!</i>

374
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,410
Mom! Dad built a device
that would be deadly
in the wrong hands!

375
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,130
And he's holding it!

376
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,048
Homer, I want you to get
that gamma-radiating
whatsit out of my home.

377
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,281
(WHINING) on...
(SNORTS)

378
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,330
I never complain
about your frilly pillows.

379
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,010
How many T-shirts
do you have here?

380
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,526
Just one.

381
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,524
It takes a Marine
honor guard to fold it.

382
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,729
It used to be a dust
cover for a Hummer.

383
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,962
I could go on and on.

384
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,971
Gravies and Lentilmen,
I have an exciting
announcement.

385
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,482
I have sold the rights
to the Bart Simpson
T-shirt line...

386
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,641
(GASPING)

387
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,645
...to the Disney Company,
which will turn
each one into a movie!

388
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,484
Really?
How much money do I get?

389
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,607
You get nothing.

390
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,207
In fact, thanks to my team
of loopy lawyers...

391
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,731
<i>(CLEARS THROAT)</i>

392
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,566
...I never have to 
give you another penny.

393
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,485
All you get is
a very valuable lesson.

394
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,528
Never trust a weirdo!

395
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,926
Azoot!

396
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,404
I'm stuck on a nail!

397
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,045
(CHUCKUNG)

398
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,849
Oh, God, that's painful.

399
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,046
(GROANS)

400
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,690
I can't feel my...

401
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,761
(WHISTLE)

402
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,601
What's the matter, boy?

403
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,241
Goose Gladwell ripped me off.
And there's nothing
I can do about it.

404
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,723
I'm just a stupid kid!
(SOBBING)

405
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,406
Son, when you
grew up, I grew down.

406
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,006
Now I can see you need
your dad more than ever.

407
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,687
And Homer, I can see
you need me more than ever.

408
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,364
Get back in the
garage, old man.

409
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,886
But there's
spiders in the boxes.

410
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,286
Stay out of my boxes!

411
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,204
You give my son
what he deserves

412
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,851
or I'll knock you
on your delightfully
offbeat ass.

413
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,131
(CHUCKLES) Oh, I must
warn you, sir, I was a
Green Beret in Vietnam.

414
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,881
The things I saw there
are what made me crazy!

415
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,330
Sir, this is a class two
plutonium fissure reactor.

416
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,442
If I turn this dial,

417
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,525
the resulting
blast would destroy
the entire tri-city area,

418
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,321
Including that guy
who sells those
Blu-Blocker sunglasses

419
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,402
people sometimes wear.

420
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,730
Damn him to hell.

421
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,211
You can't be serious.

422
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,448
Are you prepared
to take that chance?

423
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,481
Okay, okay. Here's
all the money I've got.

424
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,564
Not so fast. I also want

425
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,480
some dribble glasses,
fake boobs,
two of Bart's T-shirts

426
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,926
and that rapping
toilet seat.

427
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,407
<i>Yo, yo, yo
Keep it on the low flow</i>

428
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,721
(CHUCKUNG)

429
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,290
I'm hanging this
over the mantle.

430
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,801
Thanks, Dad.

431
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,770
Well, I'm just glad
we're back to me
being the father

432
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,683
and you being the son.

433
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,604
Are you sure that thing
could really explode?

434
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,806
Oh, I doubt it.

435
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,924
But we'll let the seagulls
at the dump figure it out.

436
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,327
(BOTH LAUGHING)

437
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,011
There's more than one
way to lose a tooth.

438
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,487
Hey, idiot, you're fat.
And your mom's
naked on the Internet.

439
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,210
You also smell.

440
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,641
Hmm.

441
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,491
You've given me
a lot to think about.
