00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,887
-He's got us there.
-Beats me.

175
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,771
Hey, Apu, this bag of ice
has a head in it.

176
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,817
Ooh, a head bag.

177
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,861
Those are chock-full of...

178
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,236
head-y goodness.

179
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,485
Hey, it's a teddy bear.

180
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,486
(sniffs) Ew, gross.

181
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,328
It's probably diseased
or something.

182
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,123
Here, Maggie.

183
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,630
(♪♪ dramatic sting)

184
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,670
(record scratch)

185
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,802
(♪♪ dramatic sting)

186
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,430
SMITHERS: Here's something
that should cheer you up, sir.

187
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,894
It's me, sir. Bobo.

188
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,135
Hug me. Squeeze me.
Tug at my fur.

189
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,647
Ooh! Enough.

190
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:08,359
Stop this grotesque charade.
Now, find my teddy.

191
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,321
Oh, and, uh,
leave the costume.

192
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:21,246
<i>The Burns bear, perhaps the most</i>
<i>valuable "wittle" bear in the world</i>

193
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,209

<i>It could be in your house.</i>

194
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,330
<i>You could be</i>
<i>looking at it right now.</i>

195
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,787
<i>It could be right in front</i>
<i>of your face as I'm saying this,</i>

196
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,418
<i>waggling back and forth, perhaps</i>
<i>being held up by a loved one.</i>

197
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,086
Maggie, I'm trying to watch TV.

198
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,966
Put that moldy old bear down.

199
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,474
Moldy? Old?

200
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,136
I'm gonna get
something to eat.

201
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,055
Well, it's not your original bear,
of course. Mm-hey!

202
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,565
But it is programmed to be
just as cuddly.

203
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,819
Aw, doggone it.

204
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,820
(growls)

205
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,151
It's supposed to be...

206
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,065
doing a little dance.

207
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,414
-BURNS: Get the bear off.
-SMITHERS: I got him.

208
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,280
Trying to turn it off.

209
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:03,037
No. Bear want to live.

210
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,080
(bear growling)

211
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,125
(soft music playing)

212
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,837

213
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,886

214
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,310
Son of a--! D'oh!
Stupid stair!

215
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,312
(gasps)

216
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,234
How long have we
had these fish?

217
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:34,113
Wait, the bear.
Burns' bear.

218
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,993
"Bobo." It's Mr. Burns' bear,
all right.

219
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,832
Well, Burns isn't getting this
back cheap, I can tell you that.

220
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:45,708
He's gonna have to give me
my own recording studio.

221
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,208

<i>special sauce, lettuce, cheese ♪</i>

223
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,998
Oh...

224
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,337
MAN: Homer, you're drooling
on the mike again.

225
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,973
I think we should just
give him the bear

226
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,840
that he cherishes
so much.

227
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,644
Hmm. Better sew
that eye back on.

228
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,436
No, let's send Burns
the eye in the mail.

229
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,690
He'll pay more money if he
thinks the bear's in danger.

230
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,652
Yes, we'll send the eye.

231
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,113
I'm sure he'll offer us
a fair reward.

232
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,824
And then we'll
make him double it.

233
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,704
ALL: Huh?

234
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,951
Well, why can't I be
greedy once in a while?

235
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:27,373
Bobo. My beautiful Bobo.

236
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,955
I promise I'll never
leave you behind again.

237
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:31,961
(clears throat)

238
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,252
Oh, yes.

239
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,415
Naturally, I can't pay you
much of a reward

240
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,214
because I'm
strapped for cash.

241
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,378
(creaking)

242
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,720
As you can see, this old
place is falling apart.

243
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,976
But I'm sure we can come
to an understanding.

244
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,098
Yes, sir.

245
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,845
(thinking) <i>Reject the first offer.</i>
<i>Reject the first offer.</i>

246
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,517
May I offer you a drink?

247
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,686
Sorry, Burns. No deal.

248
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,362
Don't worry, Smithers.

249
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,025
He's playing hardball now,

250
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,163
but it won't take him
long to crack.

251
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,332
(neck cracking)

252
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,790
I gotta call Burns.
I gotta call Burns!

253
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,501
Maybe I can still
get that drink.

254
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,962
Dad, the longer he has to wait,
the more he'll pay.

255
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,753
Right. That makes sense.

256
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,297
Yah!

257
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,800
No! No! Let me go!

258
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,007
I knew you'd come
crawling back.

259
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,846
-How much do you want?
-$1 million

260
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,022
and three Hawaiian islands.
Good ones. Not the leper one.

261
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,441
Done.
Now give me that bear.

262
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,071
Woo-hoo! I'm rich!
Rich, I tells you!

263
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,108
Here you go.
(straining)

264
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,453
It seems to be stuck.

265
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,660
Bad baby. Bad Maggie.

266
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,908
(whimpers)

267
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,961
Give me the bear.

268
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,460
The bear. The bear.

269
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,383
(sighs)

270
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,875
HOMER:
Here you go, Maggie.

271
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,888
The deal's off, Mr. Burns.

272
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,970
The bear stays here.

273
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,885
You've made a mistake, Simpson.

274
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,394
(groans)

275
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,893
Ah, big deal.

276
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,308
Who needs his money?

277
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,516
We're getting by okay.

278
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,316
-(crash)
-Son. You gotta help me.

279
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,701
I hit three people
on the way over here,

280
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,318
and I don't
have any insurance.

281
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,026
So how's about you?

282
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,662
Excellent shot, Smithers.

283
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,077
I'll be squeezing my Bobo
in no time.

284
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,416
{\an8}Howdy, gents.
What can I diddily-do you for?

285
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,713
(whimpers)

286
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,416
(thumps)

287
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:46,136
Remember Smithers,
in and out in 18 seconds.

288
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,684
(both grunt)

289
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,563
-More cocoa, Mr. Burns?
-Yes.

290
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:13,247
Mmm. Sixty-four slices
of American cheese.

291
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,919
Sixty-four.

292
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,128
Sixty-three.

293
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,749
Two.

294
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:27,127
One.

295
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:30,387
Have you been up all night
eating cheese?

296
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,681
I think I'm blind.

297
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,015
-(Burns grunts)
-Wha?

298
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,889
Good day to you.

299
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,226
(moans)

300
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,651
Excuse me, we wanted
to see the geek

301
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,980
who valued the happiness of
his children more than money.

302
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,476
Right here.

303
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,607
Ah, you said his head was
the size of a baseball.

304
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,775
My life can't get any worse.

305

-MAN: Nope.

00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,669
Hmm. I wonder
what makes it turn.

Who cares?

313
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,971
Maggie, I know you
like the bear,

314
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,639
but wouldn't you be just as
happy playing with...

315
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,888
this box?
See, Maggie?

316
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,471
See the fun box?

Mmm. I think we need
a new hair dryer.

321
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,490
Marge, you must hate me
for not taking Mr. Burns' money.

322
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,660
I don't hate you.
I'm proud of you.

323
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,330
You came through

324

the most.
