{\an8}(birds chirping)

{\an8}Oh! Looks like our birdhouse
is benefitting

00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,564
{\an8}from positive word of beak.

{\an8}A bald eagle!

00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,735
It is!

(screeches)

11
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:37,748
Maybe he's giving those
little baby birds some food.

{\an8}Marge, an eagle is our country's mascot!

16
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,297
{\an8}Fighting him is like
kicking George Washington

17
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,472
{\an8}in his wooden nuts!

18
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,471
Aah! (grunting)

Ow. Ow.

00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,976
This means war!

23
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,232
Boy, bring my toupee.

24
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,685
{\an8}Go ahead, boy.

25
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,531
{\an8}MILHOUSE: It's working!
It's definitely working!

26
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,332

gonna catch that mouse.

00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,827
{\an8}-Got you!
-Ha-ha! Stupid eagle!

29
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,086
{\an8}It wasn't the mouse we were after.
It was you!

30
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,498
{\an8}Marge, preheat the oven!

-(screeching)

32
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,676

Bag him up!

{\an8}(laughing)

35
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,308
{\an8}Not so majestic in a trash bag,
are you?

36
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,567
{\an8}Oopsie. (puffing)

37
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,031
{\an8}Seems almost a shame

38
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,111
{\an8}I'm gonna have to bang you
against the wall

39
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,906
{\an8}-till you die.
-No!

40
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,079
{\an8}Let's take the eagle
to Shelbyville Animal Rescue

41
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,618
{\an8}where you took
that injured hummingbird

42
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,331
{\an8}you found on the front lawn.

43
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,751
{\an8}Uh...

44
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,000
{\an8}um...

45
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,542
{\an8}Or maybe we can nurse him
back to health

46
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,666
{\an8}and set him free in the wild.

47
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,303
{\an8}Okay, Bart, think of a name.

48
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,930
{\an8}Make it great--
insanely, unbelievably great!

49
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,009
{\an8}-Squawky?
-Perfect.

50
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,345
{\an8}Just like when we let you name Maggie.

51
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,432
{\an8}(humming)

52
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,557
{\an8}Squawky, until I met you,

53
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,154
{\an8}I never thought I could
love something bald.

54
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,270
{\an8}-(screeches)
-Bye!

55
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,857
{\an8}We love you.

{\an8}(all gasp)

57
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,365
Oh, my God.
Brace yourselves, family.

58
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:47,294
We're about to meet a being
with intelligence far beyond ours.

59
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,415
Boy, give me my baseball bat.

60
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,921
{\an8}-Hello. I'm Elon Musk.
-HOMER: Die!

61
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,888
{\an8}-What the...
-Dad, no!

62
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:00,308
{\an8}Elon Musk is possibly
the greatest living inventor!

63
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,178
{\an8}You're the guy
who put wheels on luggage?

64
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,476
{\an8}Oh, bless you! Bless you!

65
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,600
{\an8}(crying)

66
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,977
{\an8}I'm-I'm not that guy.

67
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,443
{\an8}His company perfected electric cars

68
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,284
{\an8}and then gave away the patents!

69
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,529
{\an8}He changed the way Hollywood drives!

70
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,242
{\an8}And now he's landed in our yard.

71
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,283
{\an8}On my son's bike
and on our mailman's leg.

72
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,237
{\an8}Honey, guess who crushed me?

73
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,658
{\an8}I'll give you a hint.

74
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,456
{\an8}His first name is Elon.

75
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,369
{\an8}Ah! That's right!

76
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,629
{\an8}So, what brings you to Springfield,
Mr. Musk?

77
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,171
{\an8}What does bring me to Springfield?

78
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,924
{\an8}Well, to start with, I'm an idea man.

79
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,126
{\an8}It's my raison d'être.

80
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,716
{\an8}Mmm.

81
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,010
{\an8}Raisin Detra.

82
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,772
{\an8}I've hit a dry patch. I'm blocked.

83
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,309
{\an8}In my personal drought,
I'm traveling the country

84
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,943
{\an8}quietly by spaceship,
looking for... inspiration.

85
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,612
That's so sad.
Maybe we're the same.

86
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,941
Two lost ships in the intellectual sea.

87
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,527
Each of whom could inspire
the other to reach...

88
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,163
Hey, Elon, if you're interested,

89
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,450
you could come to the nuclear plant
where I work tomorrow.

90
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,873
-I am and I will!
-Great.

91
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,833
And if anyone asks where I am,
just cover for me.

92
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,464
-Homer!
-Fine!

93
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,880
We'll both go,
and if anybody asks you

94
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,460
something you don't understand,
just say protons.

95
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:22,473
So... do you get satellite radio
cheaper in space?

96
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:25,563
Homer, if we're gonna carpool together,
there's one thing you have to know.

97
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,890
Ass, gas or grass--
no one rides for free.

98
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,056
It's as old as the Bible.

99
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,524
No, it's that I don't talk to anyone
unless they provide

100
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,145
the mental stimulation I seek.

101
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,232
Ditto.

102
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,283
(Lisa giggles nervously) Hi.

103
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,491
I didn't want to miss one more chance
to spend time with Mr. Musk.

104
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,282
It is such an honor.

105
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,578
He is. And may I save that paper?

106
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,377
{\an8}LISA: "No ideas." (gasps)

107
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,959
{\an8}That's sad.

108
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,128
{\an8}(gasps) That's even worse.

109
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,600
-(Elon sighs)
-(Lisa gasps)

110
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,484
Aw, man, I wish those were
white meatballs.

111
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,607
(triumphant orchestra music playing)

112
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,742
Oh, my. That's an idea!

113
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,583
White meatballs-- synthetic meat
that you can print in your printer.

114
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,079
Say something else.
Please! Now!

115
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,251
Uh... don't tase me, bro.
Chocolate rain!

116
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,871
Tase, bro, chocolate rain.

117
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,037
Use electroplating to remove
metal ions from rainwater,

118
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,496
-making it suitable for drinking.
-What about the chocolate?

119
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,007
We'll make the device
a soothing chocolate color-- brilliant!

120
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,509
He's taking your Homerisms

121
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,761
and turning them into
his own great ideas!

122
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,803
This is the most inspirational
moment of my life, but...

123
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,388
unfortunately, this is my stop.

124
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,441
Bye.

125
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,268
Well, come on,
keep throwing things at me.

126
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,564
Um... (grunts)

127
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,687
Oh, this is a break.
We're-we're taking a break!

128
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,855
-(grunts)
-(laughs)

129
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,153
(both laughing)

130
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,946
I got you!

131
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,820
-MUSK: You're fun.
-Well, duh. (laughs)

132
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,328
Why don't we have fun like that, Lou?

133
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,580
(huffing)

134
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,662
Ah, Chief!

135
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,457
Did anyone ever tell you
there's a safety on that gun?

136
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,841
-What do you mean this thing?
-(grunts) That's the trigger!

137
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,094
What are you writing?
Share, buddy.

138
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,433
Suggestion for the suggestion box.

139
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,679
Can anyone make a suggestion?

140
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,350
Be my guest, but I seriously doubt

141
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,758
the old man ever reads them.

142
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,596
Suggestion 8,432.

143
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,596
Nix!

144
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,149
Hmm, technically an order,
not a suggestion.

145
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,071
"Installing an MHD generator

146
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,739
would allow the plant to operate
at a higher temperature

147
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,819
without the tyranny of moving parts

148
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,414
using conducting plasma
as the moving conductor"?

149
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,661
Excellent.
Clearly the work of Lenny.

150
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,413
That's the white one, right?

151
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,039
{\an8}-Is this your suggestion?
-No.

152
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,543
{\an8}No, mine was rubber mats
in the decontamination showers.

153
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,955
{\an8}Also, water in
the decontamination showers.

154
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,094
{\an8}Never!

155
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,840
-Mm-hmm. Mm.
-Good Lord!

156
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,172
Sir, you know who that is?

157
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,337
The man who's revolutionized
the car industry.

158
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,426
Henry Ford, good to see you.

159
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,261
As healthy and vibrant as Detroit itself.

160
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,307
No, sir, this is Elon Musk.

161
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,941
For some reason, he's sharing
a console with Homer Simpson.

162
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,558
His mind is as rich
as an Italian wedding soup.

163
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:22,566
-Homer, what are you thinking now?
-Uh, Pittsburgh 35, Dallas 31!

164
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,700
(triumphant orchestra music playing)

165
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,948
Pittsburgh steel, Dallas Cowboys...

166
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,070
Robotic cattle herding!
Thank you, Homer.

167
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,618
{\an8}(gentle music playing)

168
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,371
{\an8}Sorry, that's something I'm working on
so that I don't have to display

169
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,164
{\an8}-facial expressions.
-(electrical crackling)

170
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,997
Young man,
I look at you and I see myself.

171
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,751
How much would you charge
to work for me?

172
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,707
I don't care about the money.
The whole monetary system is

173
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,337
just a series of interconnected
heterogeneous databases.

174
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,925
Could you repeat that first part?

175
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,181
I don't care about the money.

176
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,762
Once more... with feeling?

177
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:53,847
I don't care about the money.

178
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,271
Now, let me feel the vibrations
of your lips.

179
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,560
(muffled)
I don't care about the money,

180
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,603
and I want you to get
your fingers out of my mouth!

181
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:03,067
Smithers, there's something
strange in his mouth.

182
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,479
It's called moisture.

183
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,437
Hmm, I see.

184
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,357
Okay, Musk, what do you propose?

185
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,406
Well, you'll need to increase
the capacity of your plant.

186
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,700
You cover the costs,
you get 100% of the profits.

187
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,703
Careful, Elon,
he's not as kindly as he appears.

188
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,366
(creaking)

189
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,615
Now, Burns, what if everything in town

190
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,377
not powered by electricity
were powered by electricity?

191
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,800
The electricity you sell them.
Imagine that.

192
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,969
(gasps) My doctor says
I'm not allowed to imagine,

193
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,759
so I hired someone to do it for me.

194
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,182
Send in the imaginer.

195
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,140
(humming)

196
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,981
Oh, that's fabulous.
Oh, my goodness,

197
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,519
I can see everything.

198
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,772
I'm in.

199
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,613
Oh, by the way, Mr. Burns?
I haven't been paid in a while.

200
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,399
Here you go. Imagine.

201
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,323
Ooh, Swiss francs!

202
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:51,071
Time to take my wife
for a night on the town.

203
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,695
Hey, wait a minute!

204
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,699
(sniffs)

205
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,695
So, what kind of lunch do you pack?

206
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,705
Wow, Elon, you're like Willy Wonka

207
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,631
without the underpaid munchkins.

208
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,843
Uh, I'd like to offer you something.

209
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,554
But all I got is coffee.

210
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,554
With cream!

211
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,716
Come on, I want cream.

212
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,265
Give it up. (grunting)

213
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,599
D'oh!

214
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,564
Cream and sugar
are one thing too many!

215
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,774
(triumphant orchestra music playing)

216
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,569
Exactly, exactly!

217
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,319
What if we made
the cream cup out of sugar

218
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,651
so it dissolved in the coffee?

219
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,275
Wow. Wow!

220
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,992
Between your genius and my nothing,
we make a great team!

221
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,494
Come on, give me a hug.

222
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,236
Sorry, I'm not one for hugging.

223
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,907
Well, I'm not one for just talking.

224
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,037
(violin playing romantic melody)

225
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,931
Does that drone do date nights
with the wife?

226
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,768
My partner, Montgomery Burns...

227
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,351
-ALL: Boo!
-We hate him!

228
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,516
-...and I...
-Hooray!

229
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,725
have exciting news.

230
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,444
Springfield Nuclear has electric solutions
to all of your energy needs.

231
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,185
The Springfield Hyperloop.

232
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,118
Electrifying the school
to replace the old power source,

233
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,463
Willy pushing a wheel.

234
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,538
(drumming rhythmically)

235
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,535
And my passion project,
the Glayvinator.

236
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,377
You have a Glayvinator, too?

237
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,052
Is it, um, uh, patent-pending?

238
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,131
Patent granted.

239
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:36,635
All the years of Glayvining
in my basement for naught!

240
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,799
I'm a failure.

241
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,717
Ah, yes, everyone's been there.

242
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,965
-You have those feelings, too?
-Of course not.

243
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,058
If I knew how to make a fist,
I'd hit you.

244
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,733
This is wonderful, Smithers.

245
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,441
For once in my life,
something's going my way.

246
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,732
I'm not so sure.

247
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,145
Oh, another visit from Mr. Worrywart.

248
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,534
I don't trust Musk.

249
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,411
Anyone with that much money
has a darkness in his soul.

250
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,989
Says you.

251
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,584
(sighs)

252
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,629
SMITHERS: Mr. Burns?

253
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,750
Mr. Burns?

254
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,380
Sir, Musk's ideas sound great--
too great.

255
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,966
We're meant for wretched lives.
We should pass on this.

256
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,062
And before you reply, remember,
I've never let you down.

257
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,388
-You know what I'm going to say, right?
-Release the...

258
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,274
I was going to say "Get out,"
but your idea sounds better.

259
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,732
(sighs) Can you give me
a ten-second head start?

260
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,563
Of course. One, two, three!

261
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,438
(barking)

262
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,069
Not on my carpet.

263
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,783
Attention, fans of The Little Rascals.

264
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,664
The last of them died today
in Palm Springs.

265
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,912
Now it's time for traffic with Arnie Pye.

266
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,414
Nothing to report, Kent.

267
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,616
Since Elon Musk gave everyone
self-driving cars,

268
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,918
there hasn't been a single accident.

269
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,091
(chuckles)
Well, you be careful up there, Arnie.

270
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:57,550
No need.
Mr. Musk gave me a self-flying chopper!

271
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,093
Where's Arnie?

272
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,546
Now I can get as loaded as I want,

273
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,887

I'm sure you're all eager to hear
how much richer I am.

298
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,716
Now, to end the suspense, Elon?

299
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,011
Thank you, Monty.

-Of course!

302
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,808
...we are losing roughly
$50 million a quarter.

303
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,811
Just remember, our purpose is
to show the planet how to save itself.

Oh, the planet.
I adore the planet.

Not a trick. We sacrifice now

312

313
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,706

00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,012
<i>You're welcome,</i>
<i>you're welcome, you're welcome.</i>

347
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,184

<i>You're... welcome.</i>

348
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,683
(whistles)

349
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,015
You really came back
from that Tommy John surgery.

350
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,521
Tell Musk there's more
where that came from.

351
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,444
More of what? (groans)

352
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,943
Smithers, the hounds feel terrible
for what they did,

353
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,486
and good news,
one pooped out your ear.

354
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,990
We'll dip it in iodine,
and it's just like new.

355
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,743
(groans)

356
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,164
Also, I'm sorry,
I couldn't find the records

357
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,953
of the shots the hounds
had which, in turn,

358
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,367
led to all those painful injections
in your abdomen.

359
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,706
(groans)

360
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,581
Now, the reason I'm here...

361
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,632
I've made the calls.
I'm going to have Elon Musk killed,

362
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:08,973
and I'll give you
a little extra morphine, friend.

363
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,641
(screaming)

364
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,809
-(dogs snarling)
-Oh, right, that's a trapdoor.

365
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,483
(groans)

366
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,188
What's wrong, Homer?

367
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,018
Is it that all your friends
are out of work,

368
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,654
and it's kind of your fault?

369
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,690
(scoffs) No, it's Elon.

370
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,194
I don't care how much he likes me.

371
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,815
I don't want to be friends
with him anymore.

372
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,742
None of his pie in the sky ideas
ever work out.

373
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,992
Sky pies are lie pies.

374
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,914
Of all the planets in the universe,

375
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,873
why did he have to come to this one?

376
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,163
How do you break up with a guy?

377
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,537
Here's what you do.

378
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,133
You just take his hand,

379
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,038
look in his eyes, and say,

380
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,837
"I don't want to be with you anymore."

381
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,341
Wow, you're good at that.

382
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,344
It's gotten me out of
a lot of gym memberships.

383
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,427
♪ ♪

384
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,178
Sir, I have my concern

385
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,096
about the team of hit men
you've assembled.

386
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,944
-They seem a little long in the tooth.
-Nonsense.

387
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,231
Just because a man can't see
or hold his hands steady

388
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,975
doesn't make him
any less of a marksman.

389
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,607
A yoga mat that rolls itself up.

390
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,664
Silent Velcro, baseball tickets
that guide you to your seat.

391
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,327
(gunshots)

392
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,253
Sweet Columbian Exposition!
Musk lives.

393
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,332
But, uh, three of your hit men don't.

394
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,998
The recoil was pretty bad.

395
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,706
Oh, my God, Oh, my God.
You saved my life!

396
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:32,797
Which is gonna make what
I'm about to say even more awkward.

397
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,675
Whatever you want,
we'll make it work, right, Homer?

398
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,643
Elon, Elon, Elon,
I want to say something to you,

399
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,444
and I don't want you
to be inspired by it.

400
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,058
I want you to listen.

401
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,015
No!

402
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,685
I don't want to be with you anymore.

403
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,855
Can I ask why?

404
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,032
I could say it's the being shot at,

405
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,361
or the flat,
emotionless way you talk,

406
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,077
or the fact that PayPal was my idea,

407
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,618
and I was just about to do it
when you came out with it,

408
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,582
but really it's that this town
isn't ready for you.

409
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,633
-And neither am I.
-It's okay. I'll be fine.

410
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,668
(gentle music playing)

411
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,092
It's on your face, too.

412
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,631
Well, I did save you one last prize
from the Cracker Jack box

413
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,006
that is my brain.

414
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,843
Use it as you will.

415
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,432
On the Miami Dolphins helmet,

416
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,104
the little dolphin
is also wearing a helmet.

417
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,393
Why are they always the most beautiful
just when they're breaking up with you?

418
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,940
I think it's time to tell
my luggage to self-pack.

419
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,372
Good-bye, Elon.

420
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,502
Our town will never forgive you.

421
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,499
Thanks for the real working lightsaber.

422
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,331

423
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,916
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

424
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,972
(giggles) I just wanted to see
if there was a better life,

425
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,183
even for a little bit.

426
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,064
When you're 16,
I'll drive you to Cincinnati,

427
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,192
and you'll see what there is to see.

428
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,849
Mr. Musk, before you go,

429
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,267
is there anything you could do
to give a little girl hope

430
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,396
that the world of the future
won't be as grim

431
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,993
as all our current movies forecast?

432
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,277
I guess humanity wants its change

433
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,407
one birdhouse at a time.

434
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,709
Hmm, for a man who likes electric cars,

435
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:33,093
he sure burns a lot of rocket fuel.

436
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,672
-(moans)
-What's wrong, Dad?

437
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,297
Nothing.

438
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:42,974
Elon's log, Earth date, 25 January, 2015.

439
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,636
I have left Springfield forever,

440
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,265
but there are some things
I will definitely miss.

441
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:53,444
<i>The little dolphin</i>

442
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,605
<i>Wearing a helmet. Wearing a helmet.</i>

00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,985
I never thought I'd say this,

444
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,871

miss the point.
