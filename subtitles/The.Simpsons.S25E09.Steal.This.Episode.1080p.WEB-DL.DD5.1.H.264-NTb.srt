5
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:34,958
now Radioactive Man gets
his powers <i>from</i> his suit?

6
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:38,685

if he doesn't wear it, he'll die.

undoes the stuff

Oh!

175
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:33,554
When I watched
that pirated movie,

176
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:35,478
I was stealing with my eyes.

177
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:38,106
So I'm repaying the good
people in Hollywood

178
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,329
for the ticket I
should have bought.

179
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:43,882
Now this money will end up in the
hands of the talented people

180
00:07:43,902 --> 00:07:47,317
who make magic happen
on the silver screen.

181
00:07:52,703 --> 00:07:54,189
(inhales)

182
00:07:54,222 --> 00:07:55,509
Ah...

183
00:07:58,589 --> 00:07:59,356
(startled gasp)

184
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:01,424
Karen, get me the FBI!

185
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:02,593
Karen!

186
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:17,701
You people joined this
squad for one reason:

187
00:08:17,734 --> 00:08:19,381
to fight movie pirates.

188
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:21,154
I wanted to catch
serial killers.

189
00:08:21,172 --> 00:08:23,112
(mocking, whiny tone): "I wanted
to catch serial killers."

190
00:08:23,114 --> 00:08:24,867
From now on, you will
lay down your lives

191
00:08:24,885 --> 00:08:27,200
to protect America's
chick flicks, buddy comedies

192
00:08:27,218 --> 00:08:30,421
and steady stream
of animated misfires.

193
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,736
Sir, you have to see this.

194
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:34,511
"Took it off the Web...

195
00:08:34,532 --> 00:08:35,879
"watched for free...

196
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,740

197
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:40,301
Men, set your guns on "kill."

198
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:42,751
We're going after Homer Simpson.

199
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,424
I now present, direct from the
computer of an angry editor

200
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,114
at a special effects house,

201
00:08:48,132 --> 00:08:51,234
<i>Cosmic Wars Episode Seven.</i>

202
00:08:51,268 --> 00:08:53,603
(epic orchestral theme playing)

203
00:09:00,844 --> 00:09:02,788
(audience cheering)

204
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,108
My childhood has been un-ruined!

205
00:09:18,134 --> 00:09:19,474
Listen up, seat meat!

206
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:23,472
You are all in violation of Title
17 of the U.S. Copyright Code.

207
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,552

208
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:26,156
Easy there, hotshot.

209
00:09:26,171 --> 00:09:28,759
All the people are doing
is watching a movie.

210
00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:30,726
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

211
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:34,788
I'm not wearing an undershirt and
my badge is poking into my skin.

212
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:36,031
What's going on here?

213
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:37,987
Is there a fondler
in the neighborhood?

214
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:41,157
I'm here to arrest and hopefully
stage the prison suicide

215
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,290
of the mastermind of
this operation...

216
00:09:43,314 --> 00:09:44,534
Homer Simpson!

217
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,417
Ooh, mastermind.

218
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:51,535
We got our man, thanks to a tip
from a heroic American snitch.

219
00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:52,240
(gasps)

220
00:09:52,265 --> 00:09:54,265
One of you turned me in?

221
00:09:54,284 --> 00:09:55,804
Who was it?

222
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:58,328
You!

223
00:09:59,277 --> 00:10:01,118
Superintendent Chalmers,

224
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:02,727
you never forgave
me for that time

225
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,386
we wore the same Hawaiian
shirt to that luau!

226
00:10:06,745 --> 00:10:08,222
They're gonna take Dad!

227
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:10,510
- We gotta do something!
- I'm on it.

228
00:10:16,853 --> 00:10:17,866
(screams)

229
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:19,598
Copyrighted material!

230
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:20,905
Don't look at it!

231
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:22,659
Someone sell me a ticket!

232
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,371
Ear plugs in!
Blinders on!

233
00:10:24,395 --> 00:10:26,083
We trained for this!

234
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:35,325
(gunshot)

235
00:10:35,505 --> 00:10:38,120
(grunting)

236
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:45,280
From now on, the only place
you'll be watching movies

237
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:47,706
without having to buy
a ticket is jail.

238
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,813
Oh... oh...

239
00:10:49,838 --> 00:10:51,111
(whimpers)

240
00:10:51,714 --> 00:10:55,088
Baby, promise me you'll
find out who turned me in.

241
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:56,028
(moans)

242
00:10:56,054 --> 00:10:58,587
It's probably someone I
would never suspect.

243
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,209
Never suspect.

244
00:11:00,237 --> 00:11:01,838

245
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:04,387
Your moans of sympathy

Oh...

247
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:11,205
HOMER: Whoever did this to me will be
haunted by unbearable guilt forever!

248
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:13,252
Forever!

249
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,044
What are you guys in for?

250
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:24,444
Bank robbery.

251
00:11:24,462 --> 00:11:25,803
Drug trafficking.

252
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,897
- What about you?
- Movie piracy.

253
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:29,138
- (all gasp)
- What?!

254
00:11:29,173 --> 00:11:32,020
People in show business work
hard to make those movies.

255
00:11:32,036 --> 00:11:36,277
My media stocks under-performed
because of people like you.

256
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:38,717
My brother lost his job
as a grip

257
00:11:38,736 --> 00:11:41,100
on a movie set
because of piracy.

258
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:43,069
He had to sell his Jet Ski.

259
00:11:43,094 --> 00:11:46,447
A grip without a Jet Ski
ain't no grip at all!

260
00:11:46,523 --> 00:11:47,854
(yelling)

261
00:11:51,348 --> 00:11:55,529
You're about to find out what
we do to copyright infringers.

262
00:11:55,552 --> 00:11:56,519

263
00:11:56,573 --> 00:11:58,174

264
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:01,809
(all clamoring)

265
00:12:06,487 --> 00:12:08,747
(train horn blowing in distance)
Uh... huh?

266
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,659
(horn blowing)
Huh...? (screams)

267
00:12:12,095 --> 00:12:13,836

Whoo-hoo!

271
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:38,491
It's almost like
having Dad here.

272
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:41,125
Only with less growling
when I go near his food.

273
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:43,603
I just want to know who
dropped the dime on Dad.

274
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:44,785
Lousy rat.

275
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:47,767
Maybe the person that
turned your father in

276
00:12:47,774 --> 00:12:49,994
thought they were doing
the right thing.

277
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,684
Homer just pirated a movie.

278
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:53,741
But it's not the worst thing
Dad ever did.

279
00:12:53,756 --> 00:12:56,342
It's not even the worst kind
of pirate Dad's ever been.

280
00:12:56,365 --> 00:12:59,832
Lisa, tell your brother that
stealing is wrong, no matter what.

281
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:03,178
I don't know. It wasn't like
Dad was stealing for himself.

282
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:06,338
He created this wonderful
experience for the whole town.

283
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:09,171
I just can't imagine
anyone turning him in.

284
00:13:12,673 --> 00:13:13,800
(door creaking open)

285
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:17,256
- Dad, Dad, you're back, you're back!
- Hey! - Dad, you're back! Dad!

286
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:19,882
Homer, what are you
doing out of prison?

287
00:13:19,902 --> 00:13:21,970
You have to go back
and give yourself up.

288
00:13:21,998 --> 00:13:24,205
I can't go back to jail!

289
00:13:24,218 --> 00:13:27,216
There's no shampoo, just soap!

290
00:13:27,256 --> 00:13:29,765
Wait, I know one
place in Springfield

291
00:13:29,778 --> 00:13:32,788
that doesn't care about
Internet piracy laws.

292
00:13:36,112 --> 00:13:37,693
Thanks for taking us in.

293
00:13:37,712 --> 00:13:40,458
Our family always
appreciates asylum.

294
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:44,084
This consulate is like
being on Swedish soil.

295
00:13:44,103 --> 00:13:46,995
You're as safe here as you
would be in the Skatteskrapan.

(whistles)

297
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:52,271
Your country doesn't think illegally
downloading movies is wrong?

298
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,777
The people of Sweden believe all
movies should be shared freely.

299
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:57,644
How is that not stealing?

300
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,064
Bah, your Hollywood studios
are the real thieves,

301
00:14:01,084 --> 00:14:03,951
claiming all their hit
movies have lost money.

302
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:06,292
I spit on their bookkeeping.

303
00:14:06,316 --> 00:14:09,129
Yeah, and why don't they
make a sequel to <i>Taken</i>

304
00:14:09,158 --> 00:14:11,085
where <i>The Hangover
</i> guys get taken

305
00:14:11,107 --> 00:14:14,317
and the only ones that could
rescue them is <i>Fast and Furious.</i>

306
00:14:14,336 --> 00:14:17,280
Aw, man, I would
love to pirate that.

307
00:14:17,293 --> 00:14:20,347

people of Sweden.

Consulate.

00:16:37,987 --> 00:16:40,466
And not just the people
who dream for a living,

352
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:42,451
but the people
who depend on us.

353
00:16:42,491 --> 00:16:44,291
The spin class instructors,

354
00:16:44,311 --> 00:16:46,793
the personal rabbis, Seth Rogen.

355
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:49,310
(laughing)

356
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,725
(crying):
It's true, I need him.

357
00:16:52,748 --> 00:16:55,445
I saw a bootleg DVD of
<i>The 40 Year Old Virgin</i>

358
00:16:55,465 --> 00:16:57,080
for sale at a car wash.

359
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,040
They left off my
director's commentary!

360
00:17:00,056 --> 00:17:02,201
It didn't even have
a blooper reel!

361
00:17:02,217 --> 00:17:03,469
(all groaning)

362
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,827
<i>(gavel banging)</i>

363
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:06,877
Homer Simpson, you
have been found guilty

364
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:10,357
of illegal reproduction and
distribution of copyrighted material.

365
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:12,992
Before sentencing, do you have
anything to say for yourself?

366
00:17:13,002 --> 00:17:13,857
No.

367
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,910
Homer, tell them your
side of the story.

368
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:20,428
I know I hurt you, but
please trust me now.

369
00:17:20,454 --> 00:17:21,715
It'll work.

370
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,956
You know what, Judge Apatow?

371
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:26,895
I do have something to say.

372
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,523
These movie people
may say I'm a pirate,

373
00:17:29,545 --> 00:17:31,045
but I'm just a man.

374
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,561
A man who loved
Hollywood too much.

375
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:36,380
So I made my own rules
and fought the big guys

376
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:38,863
who tried to destroy
my way of life.

377
00:17:38,888 --> 00:17:40,448
He doesn't sound like a villain.

378
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,134
- He sounds like a classic underdog.
- He's the unlikeliest of heroes!

379
00:17:44,151 --> 00:17:45,918
But where's the love story?

380
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:47,808
At first my wife
didn't believe in me.

381
00:17:47,837 --> 00:17:51,292
Maybe we forgot why we fell
in love in the first place.

382
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,329
But when times seemed
darkest, one minute ago,

383
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:57,657
she was there and gave me
the strength and courage

384
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,930
to fight for what I believe in.

385
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:03,900
He's a downloading David
versus a greedy Goliath.

386
00:18:03,913 --> 00:18:06,899
An Erin Brockovich
but with more cleavage!

387
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,847
Two, three... Good Lord, he's
hitting all four quadrants!

388
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:14,736
One family, against all
odds, took on the system...

389
00:18:14,763 --> 00:18:16,517
and lost.

390
00:18:16,552 --> 00:18:18,086
(clamoring)

391
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,595
Mr. Simpson, I'd like to buy
the rights to make a movie

392
00:18:20,615 --> 00:18:22,048
based on your true story.

393
00:18:22,071 --> 00:18:23,604
I'm attached as
executive producer!

394
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:24,851
Attached! Attached!

395
00:18:24,864 --> 00:18:27,892
One movie?
We envision a trilogy.

396
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,149
Will Smith's family wants
to play your family.

397
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,410
I'd be Jaden.

398
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:33,415
(all clamoring)

399
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:35,560
On behalf of Hollywood,

400
00:18:35,585 --> 00:18:37,871
we are dropping all charges.

401
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:40,687
These people hate my dad.

402
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,027
How can they want to
make a movie about him?

403
00:18:43,052 --> 00:18:45,325
Hollywood may be run
by big corporations

404
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:47,771
trying to squash people,
but they make movies

405
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,919
about people standing up
to big corporations

406
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:52,226
trying to squash
them and winning.

407
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:55,451
I'll sign with whoever can
convince Channing Tatum

408
00:18:55,471 --> 00:18:57,877
to gain the most
weight to play me.

409
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:06,767
- Surprise! - Surprise!
- Surprise!

410
00:19:06,782 --> 00:19:08,189
What the hell is all this?

411
00:19:08,211 --> 00:19:09,818
We're so excited
about your movie

412
00:19:09,824 --> 00:19:11,485
that we're having
a special screening.

413
00:19:11,506 --> 00:19:14,061
But the movie isn't in
theaters till next week.

414
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,583
Yeah, we ripped a version off Bootleg
Bay just like you taught us.

415
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:21,496
It's still got timecode on it,
but, otherwise, it's a clean copy.

416
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:22,817
(chuckles)

417
00:19:22,838 --> 00:19:25,218
You're pirating my movie?

418
00:19:25,225 --> 00:19:28,150
The hell you are!
Piracy is stealing!

419
00:19:28,177 --> 00:19:31,172
You're taking money out
of my family's mouths!

420
00:19:31,374 --> 00:19:32,207
(gasping)

421
00:19:32,227 --> 00:19:35,411
But the movie is... i-it's
about you pirating movies.

422
00:19:35,444 --> 00:19:37,451
Oh, that's Hollywood fantasy.

423
00:19:37,473 --> 00:19:41,306
We live in the real world, where
I have something called...

424
00:19:41,324 --> 00:19:44,344
prof-it par-tic-i-pa-tion.

425
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:46,363
That's negative, man.

426
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:47,956
Oh, Homie...

427
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:52,480
Now all of you go see my movie
in the theater the day it opens!

428
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:54,521
No bargain matinees!

429
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:56,483
And tell your friends
it was great!

430
00:19:56,512 --> 00:19:59,685
Buy the stuff they advertise
in the commercials before it!

431
00:19:59,707 --> 00:20:04,334
Homer in the movie wears Ask
Body Spray and so should you!

432
00:20:04,353 --> 00:20:06,754
Don't ask! Do smell!

433
00:20:06,782 --> 00:20:08,656
Homie, do you really
think you should be...

434
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,709
Up-bup-bup-bup-bup!

435
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:13,058
What have we learned about not
blindly supporting our husband?

436
00:20:13,335 --> 00:20:15,713
Ask Body Spray!

438
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:33,269
But then when times
seemed darkest,

439
00:20:33,295 --> 00:20:36,004
she was there; she gave me
the strength and courage

440
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:38,062
to fight for what I believe in.

441
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:40,115
On behalf of Hollywood,

442
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:42,708
we're dropping all charges!

443
00:20:42,978 --> 00:20:44,699
(cheering)

444
00:20:46,234 --> 00:20:48,602
(laughing)

445
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,204
So what do you think, Lise?
Who are the good guys here,

446
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:53,792
the media companies or
the Internet freedom guys?

447
00:20:53,814 --> 00:20:56,449
Well, both groups claim
their intentions are noble,

448
00:20:56,462 --> 00:20:57,875
but at the end of the day,

449
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,614
they're both trying to steal
as much money as they can.

450
00:21:00,628 --> 00:21:02,863
So... everyone's a pirate?

451
00:21:02,877 --> 00:21:04,904
And the worst one of all is...

452
00:21:45,926 --> 00:21:48,242
(Seth Rogen laughing)

453
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,492
Shh!
