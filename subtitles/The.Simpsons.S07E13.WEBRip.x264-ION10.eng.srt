Hey, I never noticed this place.

Dad, it's right across
the street from us.

51
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,566
That fancy house
will never sell.

52
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,978
Nobody who could afford it

53
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,356
would want to live in
this neighborhood.

54
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,112
Hey, what's wrong
with this neighborhood?

55
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,784
Big shot! Too good to buy
a house here, snobby?

56
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:37,985
Who are you
talking to, Homer?

57
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,414
The guy who
doesn't live there.

58
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,702
{\an8}Can we get rid
of this Ayatollah t-shirt?

59
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,996
Khomeini died years ago.

60
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,460
But, Marge,
it works on any Ayatollah.

61
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,631
Ayatollah Nakhbadeh,
Ayatollah Zahedi...

62
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,501
even as we speak,
Ayatollah Razmara

63
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,378
and his cadre of fanatics
are consolidating their power.

64
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:57,425
I don't care who's
consolidating their power.

65
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,140
Well, we don't need this.

66
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,720
But, Marge, that's the
Rhinestone Nights fashion gun.

67
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,227
I need it to rhinestone up
my old clothing.

68
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,770
Who's Disco Stu?

69
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,653
I wanted to write disco stud,
but I ran out of space.

70
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,151
Not that Disco Stu didn't get
his share of the action.

71
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,405
So if you're looking for
a half bag of charcoal briquettes

72
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,741
or an artificial
Christmas tree-- trunk only--

73
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,157
come on over
to the Hibbard table, pronto.

74
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,496
Well, sir, looks like we got

75
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,461
some nice items
here at table Glick.

76
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,251
Like this... what the
heckaroonie is this, Mrs. Glick?

77
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,256
It is a candy dish, Ned. $90.

78
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,509
Uh-huh. Well, I, uh...

79
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,591
I guess you could put
a lot of nice things in there.

80
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,506
No! Just candy, Ned. $90.

81
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,387
Well, looks like
somebody sold something today.

82
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,229
Are you interested
in that motorized tie rack,

83
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,606
Principal Skinner?

84
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,992
(motor whirring)

85
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,530
Hmm... it's
awfully loud.

86
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,573
Well, you can always
take the motor out

87
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,788
and use it
as an ordinary tie rack.

88
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,078
But now the ties
are motionless

89
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,962
and those in back are
virtually inaccessible.

90
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,290
Well, it's a moot point,

91
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,915
as I have only one
tie to begin with.

92
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,091
I believe I'll pass.

93
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,173
Have you sold
that tie rack yet?

94
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,377
-No.
-I'll take it.

95
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,586
Now, folks,
nothing spells fun

96
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,677
like rhinestones
on a dungaree jacket.

97
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,143
Stu, you should
buy that.

98
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:29,193
Hey, Disco Stu
doesn't advertise.

99
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,359
Uh... hey, Ned, let me
help you with that.

100
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,068
Hey, everybody! Who thinks
Flanders should shut up?

101
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,149
(all yelling in agreement)

102
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,361
So, anyone here from
Evergreen Terrace?

103
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,157
(applause and cheering)

104
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,541
I think this is
the best neighborhood in town.

105
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,948
Anybody agree with me?

106
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:47,946
(cheering)

107
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,657
You're the king, Homer!

108
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,247
King of the neighborhood.

109
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:55,552
Say, that Ayatollah
thinks he's better than America.

110
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,668
Is he right?

111
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,094
(booing)

112
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,842
MAN:
Yes.

113
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:03,854
Well, for only five dollars,
you can sock it to him in style.

114
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:04,888
Right here!

115
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,261
And for the man

116
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:09,477
who has everything,
a tie rack motor.

117
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,849
I'll take that.

118
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:15,765

It's just
some new guy moving in.

138
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,240
(clears throat)

139
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,748
Disco Stu likes disco music.

(electronic feedback)

141
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,099
Hi there, neighbors.

142
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,009
I'm... George Bush.

143
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,016
Former President George Bush?

144
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,824
(murmurs of recognition)

145
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,608
HOMER: Okay, let's give it up
for the new guy.

146
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:46,283
Now let's all turn around
and pay attention to me again.

147
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,624
Hello?

148
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,778
Hello?

149
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,037
Hello?

150
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,457
{\an8}Wow! A former President
living right across the street.

151
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,883
Oh! Why did he have
to move in on my territory?

152
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,342
Look at him.

153
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,132
Thinks just because
he led the free world

154
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,625
he can act like a big shot.

155
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,386
Stupid President.

156
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,678
Why couldn't he just stay
in his own state?

157
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,972
Actually, this is one
of the nine states

158
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,715
where Mr. Bush
claims residency, Dad.

159
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,518
I wouldn't have
voted for him

160
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,231
but it's nice to have a
celebrity in the neighborhood.

161
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,691
Wait a minute.

162
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,521
If Lisa didn't vote for him

163
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,356
and I didn't vote for him...

164
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,112
You didn't vote
for anybody.

165
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:27,993
I voted for Prell to go back
to the old glass bottle.

166
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,122
After that,
I became deeply cynical.

167
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,909
And your business
here, Mr. Flanders?

168
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,124
Well, sir,
I'm welcoming the Bushes

169
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,584
on behalf of the
Neighborhood Association.

170
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,707
Never mind
about that, Ray.

171
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,292
Just give them a quick pass
with the metal detector

172
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,797
and let them on in.

173
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,589
Hey, Bar!
The neighbors are here.

174
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,550
Howdily-doodily there,
President Bush

175
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,143
or should I say
President neighbor?

176
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,809
I'm Ned Flanders and this
is Maude, Rod and Todd.

177
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,020
Well, howdily-doodily
yourself there, Ned.

178
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,640
This is my wife, Barbara.

179
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,767
Call her Bar.
Would you like some lemonade?

180
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,734
-Tip-top-notch!
-Okily-dokily.

181
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,444
Thankily-dankily.

182
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,444
Greatalicious!

183
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,685
Scrumpdiddlerific!

184
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,946
BOTH: Fine and dandy
like sour candy.

185
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,159
Bar's a whiz
with cold drinks

186
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,318
aren't you, Bar?

187
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,026
Don't understand
lemonade myself.

188
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,866
Not my forte.

189
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,331
What brings you
to Springfield?

190
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,831
Well, George and I

191
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,373
just wanted to be
private citizens again...

192
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,746
go where nobody cared
about politics.

193
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,213
So we found the town

194
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,343
with the lowest voter
turnout in America.

195
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,050
Just happy to be here
among good, average people

196
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,011
with no particular
hopes or dreams.

197
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:34,012
But, Mr. President,
we're not all good people.

198
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,426
There's one little boy
you should watch out for.

199
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,596
He's a bad,
bad little boy.

200
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,854
(laughing nervously)

201
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,556
Now, Todd,
don't scare the President.

202
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,742
(panting)

203
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,746
Huh... look at those phonies,
sucking up to Bush.

204
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,170
(whimpering)

205
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,960
(barking)

206
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:08,803
I guess you might say he's
barking up the wrong Bush.

207
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,801
HOMER'S BRAIN:
<i>There it is, Homer.</i>

208
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,593
<i>The cleverest thing you'll</i>
<i>ever say and nobody heard it.</i>

209
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,547
D'oh!

210
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,506
Ah!

211
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,887
Just going to relax

212
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,394
with my U.S. News and World
whatnot.

213
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,516
Oh, good.

214
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,152
They're roasting the new guy.

215
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,320
(imitating Dennis the Menace)
Hello... Mr. Bush!

216
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,730
George...

217
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,818
this is a neighborhood
boy, Bart Simpson.

218
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,573
He came over
to say hi.

219
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,815
(quietly)
Hello.

220
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,526
Hi! Hey, what's this?

221
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,576
My electric card shuffler.
Don't go near the--

222
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,911
Now, I told you.

223
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,247
Oh... those cards
were from Air Force One

224
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,542
and they only give you
so many packs.

225
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,416
Oh, George,
boys will be boys.

226
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,133
Bart's just being friendly.

227
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,883
Why don't you get off that sofa
and show Bart your photos?

228
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,546
Oh, he'll gunk
them all up.

229
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,354
His hands are probably covered
with mud and cookies.

230
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,349
Well...

231
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,931
(muttering)
Probably stole a napkin.

232
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,477
Who's that, George?

233
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,100
That's me with
Charlton Heston. He was...

234
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,436
Who's that, George?

235
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,151
Now see, you
wouldn't know him.

236
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,151
That's Bob Mosbacher,
He was Secretary of...

237
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,113
That's a dumb name.
Who's that, George?

238
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,363
Maybe he thinks Bart
is a dumb name.

239
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,946
How many times were
you President, George?

240
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,371
Just once.

241
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,279
Bar, isn't it time
for dinner yet?

242
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,117
I'm making rice.
It'll be a while.

243
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,293
Did your
Secret Service goons

244
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,371
ever whack anybody,
George?

245
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,666
You know, in my day,

246
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,170
little boys didn't call their
elders by their first names.

247
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,963
Yeah, well, welcome
to the 20th century, George.

248
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,878
(muttering) I'll kick you right out of
the 20th century, you little...

249
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,054
(tires screeching)

250
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,597
Oh, man! I only got one minute
till they stop serving

251
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,060
those breakfast balls. D'oh!

252
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,351
Let's see now.

253
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,314
What do you folks
have here, huh?

254
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,404
Hmm, a Krusty Burger.

255
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,940
That doesn't sound
too appetizing.

256
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,613
What kind of stew
do you have today?

257
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,901
<i>Uh, we don't have stew.</i>

258
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,355
(honking)

259
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,315
Sir, why don't you just
have the cheeseburger?

260
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,985
Oh, that's really more
of a weekend thing, Ray.

261
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,485
Hey, jerk!
Move your fanny!

262
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,197
That guy is louder
than World War II.

263
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,327
Ray, go see what
the rhubarb is, will you?

264
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,174
(honking)

265
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,539
Sir, could you
pop your hood?

266
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,997
(horn braying)

267
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,508
Hey! My taxes paid
for that horn.

268
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,553
Why, hello, Mrs. Bush.

269
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,764
Hi, Bart.

270
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,973
Mr. Bush is
upstairs napping.

271
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,724
You know, your husband's
awful grumpy.

272
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,636
Oh, that's just his way.

273
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,274
He really likes you.

274
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,771
You know, it's time
for him to get up

275
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,272
and work on his memoirs.

276
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,814
Why don't you
go wake him?

277
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,152
(horn sounding)

278
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,323
What? What the--

279
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,861
Great Scott, don't touch that.

280
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,994
That's the alpenhorn
Helmut Kohl gave me.

281
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,372
Where'd you get
those pajamas?

282
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,118
They're presidential pajamas.

283
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,620
You have to be president,
and you're not president.

284
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,623
Yes, I am.

285
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,624
No, you're not! Bar!

286
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,171
Hey, where's your candy?

287
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,173
We don't have any.
Now, go away.

288
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,165
George!

289
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,297
Older people don't eat
much candy, Bart

290
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,804
but I could bake you
some cookies if you like.

291
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,387
(muttering) Can't remember the last time
she made cookies for me.

292
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,063
-What's that?
-Oh, nothing.

293
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,272
{\an8}HOMER:
All right.

294
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,061
His story checks out.

295
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,395
Marge, would you love me
more if I were President?

296
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,111
'Cause I'll do it
if it'll make you happy.

297
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,401
Homie, as long
as you keep

298
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,284
the car full of gas,
I'm happy.

299
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:21,822
Well, she can always
depend on that.

300
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,695
-(typing)
-And since I'd achieved

301
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:31,037
all my goals as President
in one term

302
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,745
there was no need for a second.

303
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,842
Hmm... good memoirs.

304
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,296
Good, not great.

305
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,046
Now, let's look
at that old outboard.

306
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,218
Soup that baby up,
rattle a few windows

307
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,307
down in Kennebunkport
next May.

308
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,725
Hello... Mr. Bush!

309
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,439
What you doing?

310
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,485
Don't upset the desk there.

311
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,739
Careful! Don't want
to horse around with...

312
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,240
Hey, cool! What does this do?

313
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,032
Now don't you pull that cord,
young man!

314
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,525
(engine revving)

315
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,117
GEORGE: Now look what you did.
Whoops! Hey!

316
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,622
Bar, my motor's gone loco!

317
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,834
Oh! The birdhouse.

318
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,625
My prize orchids!

319
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,295
Oh, no!
Not the memoirs.

320
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,307
Don't even
think about it.

321
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,308
Not gonna happen.

322
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,017
(groans)

323
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,315
(engine stops)

324
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,319
Whoa, man.

325
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,780
Whoa, nothing.

326
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,280
I'm going to do something

327
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,372
your Daddy should
have done a long time ago.

328
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,700
Now go home and think about
what you've done, young man.

329
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,003
He spanked you?

330
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,794
You? Bart Simpson?

331
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,337
I begged him to stop

332
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,420
but he said it was
for the good of the nation.

333
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,966
Big deal.

334
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,509
When I was a pup,
we got spanked by Presidents

335
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,182
till the cows came home.

336
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,681
Grover Cleveland spanked me

337
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,972
on two non-consecutive
occasions.

338
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:12,516
Grampa, I know in your day,
spanking was common

339
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,141
but Homer and I
just don't believe

340
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,858
in that kind of punishment.

341
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,518
And that's why your no-good
kids are running wild!

342
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,444
First, Bush invades
my home turf,

343
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,027
then he takes my pals,

344
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,872
then he makes fun
of the way I talk... probably.

345
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,578
Now he steals my right

346
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,408
to raise a disobedient,
smart-alecky son!

347
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,414
Well, that's it!

348
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,576
Hey, Bush!

349
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,376
Get out here!

350
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,129
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going?

351
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,382
I'm going to punch
George Bush in the face.

352
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,554
Okay. Is he expecting you?

353
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,933
You owe me
an apology.

354
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,850
Hey, you owe me
an apology.

355
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,598
If you were
any kind of a father

356
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,640
you'd have disciplined
that boy a long time ago.

357
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,385
You want to step back, sir?

358
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,596
-You're trampling the flowers.
-Ooh!

359
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,517
Hiding behind your goons,
eh, Bush?

360
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,567
Oh!

361
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,859
Well, you are a wimp!

362
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,113
Wimp... am I?

363
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,447
Agent Johnson?

364
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,032
Agent Heintz?

365
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,407
You men, stand down.

366
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,538
All right, mister.

367
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,455
You want trouble,
you're going to get trouble.

368
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,553
Oh, I want trouble, all right.

369
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,799
Then you're going
to get trouble.

370
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,590
No, you're going
to get trouble.

371
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,223
Oh, that's good, that's good
'cause I want trouble.

372
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,221
Then we're agreed

373
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,642
there'll be trouble.

374
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,640
Oh, yeah,
lots of trouble.

375
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,642
-Trouble, it is.
-For you.

376
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,184
-For... D'oh!
-(door slams)

377
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,813
(chuckles)
This is gonna be sweet.

378
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,397
200 bottle rockets,
and George Bush

379
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,493
doing toe-touches
by an open window.

380
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,488
BART: If you get one
up his butt,

381
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,489
it's a million points.

382
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,160
(sizzling)

383
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,199
(whistling)

384
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,532
(booming)

385
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,544
BARBARA:
Why don't you just

386
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,291
say you're
sorry, George?

387
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,293
Because I'm right.

388
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,834
Oh, no.

389
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,877
I'm going to fix
their wagon good.

390
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,801
I've pulled some pranks
in my time.

391
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,049
(rattling)

392
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,511
{\an8}DR. HIBBERT:
Uh, I don't understand.

393
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,682
Are you saying you and
Barbara are bad neighbors?

394
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,601
No, that's not Bar
and me, it's them.

395
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,061
Who? Maude and me?

396
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,640
No, the man
and his boy.

397
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,595
You know, the...
the boy is named Bart.

398
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,977
I don't know the
name of the man.

399
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,823
Bar, what's the
name of the man?

400
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,438
I'm not getting
involved, George.

401
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,435
Look, just never mind.

402
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,736
I thought the banner

403
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,279
was pretty
straightforward

404
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,862
but... guess I'll
just take it down.

405
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,697
BARBARA:
George...

406
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,122
it's time to
get dressed.

407
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,950
Nuh-uh. I'm not
going outside today,

408
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,615
not with those
neighbors.

409
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,464
Staying right here till
my speech to the Elks Club.

410
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,460
(knocking)

411
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,831
HOMER:
Yoo-hoo.

412
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,884
Who is it?

413
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,343
HOMER: It's your sons,
George Bush, Jr. and Jeb Bush.

414
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,804
Come outside, Dad.

415
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,223
Oh, good.

416
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,391
Bar, the boys are out
in the front yard.

417
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,799
They'll help me
think of a plan

418
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,177
to get those
Simpsons.

419
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,224
Oh, George, is that all
you ever think about?

420
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,977
The boys probably just want a
letter of recommendation.

421
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,863
Boys? Where
you going?

422
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,320
Okay, son, give him the glue.

423
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,650
(Homer grunting)

424
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,107
(Homer and Bart laughing)

425
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,117
HOMER:
Hey, looking good!

426
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,370
GEORGE:
And that's why I will continue

427
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:22,964
to oppose teen alcoholism
in all its forms.

428
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,840
Now, are there any questions?

429
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:33,512
Keeping in mind that I already
explained about my hair.

430
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,554
(mumbling)
Oh, yeah, that's right.

431
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,019
(engine revving)

432
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,386
(tires squealing)

433
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,438
(mud splattering)

434
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,321
President Bush is
driving on our lawn.

435
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,529
He must be lost.

436
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,359
He's not lost.

437
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,744
Looks like we're
experiencing

438
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,280
some blow-back from
the wig offensive.

439
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,953
It's time to hit
him where he lives.

440
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:55,952
His house?

441
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,033
Bingo.

442
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,080
So I thought to myself

443
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,035
'what would God do
in this situation?'

444
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,035
{\an8}(buzzing)

445
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,416
{\an8}(snickering)
Locusts...

446
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,803
{\an8}They'll drive him nuts.

447
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,419
It's all in the Bible, son.

448
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,506
{\an8}It's the prankster's Bible.

449
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,221
(engine revving)

450
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:25,307
Hmm. Can't decide if this'll
be considered feisty or crazy.

451
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,435
Hey! Hey, what the..?

452
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,105
Ohh, if he thinks George Bush
will stay out of the sewer

453
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,153
he doesn't know George Bush.

454
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,373
Hey, turkeys, behind you.

455
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,409
For the last time, Bush,
apologize for spanking my boy.

456
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,004
Never.

457
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,159
You make him apologize
for destroying my memoirs.

458
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,328
You didn't tell me you
destroyed his memoirs.

459
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,627
Never!

460
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,433
Yay, Dad!

461
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,305
I really feel awful
about your lawn, Marge.

462
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,523
George can be
so stubborn

463
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,102
when he thinks
he's right.

464
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,647
Well, Homer too.
They're so much alike.

465
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,781
Too bad they got off
on the wrong foot.

466
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,359
It's just like
the Noriega thing.

467
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,574
Now, he and George are
the best of friends.

468
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,576
(both panting)

469
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,909
Here's a little something
we learned in C.I.A.

470
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,365
(buzzing)

471
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,417
Get him, boys.

472
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,380
(buzzing)

473
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,222
(doorbell ringing)

474
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,352
Hello?

475
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,389
Hello?

476
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,350
(buzzing)

477
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,571
I'll ruin you like
a Japanese banquet.

478
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,740
I'll take your
head, and...

479
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:56,819
Gorbachev.

480
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:57,994
(nervous chuckling)

481
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,821
What are you
doing here?

482
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,617
I just dropped by with present
for warming of house.

483
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,751
Instead, find you
grappling with local oaf.

484
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,789
Oh, brought some of
your commie friends

485
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,543
to help you
fight dirty, eh?

486
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,245
But, Mikhail, he put
a wig on my head,

487
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,246
my memoirs...

488
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,247
BARBARA: George...

489
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,548
this is the last straw.

490
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,761
You apologize
to Homer right now.

491
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,181
But, Bar, we can't
show any weakness

492
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,600
in front of
the Russians.

493
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,848
George.

494
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,851
Yes, dear.

495
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,436
(speaking Russian)

496
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,941
(laughing)

497
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,613
Okay.

498
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,322
I'm sorry I spanked
your boy, Homer.

499
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,453
Woo hoo!

500
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,239
In your face, Bush!

501
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,743
Now, apologize
for the tax hike.

502
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,872
It's a shame it didn't
work out, Marge

503
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,588
but George just felt
this neighborhood

504
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,839
brought out the worst
in him, and...

505
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,460
(honking)

506
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,796
(honking)

507
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:00,835
Oh, my.

508
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,386
Well, so long.

509
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,771
Bye-bye.

510
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,648
Hi.

511
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,530
Pleased to meet you.
I just moved in.

512
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,866
My name is Jerry Ford.

513
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,912
(gasping)

514
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,655
Former President Gerald Ford?

515
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,866
Put her there.
I'm Homer Simpson.

516
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,037
Say, Homer,
do you like football?

517
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,587
Do I ever?

518
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,550
Do you like nachos?

519
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,260
Yes, Mr. Ford.

520
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,260
Well...

521
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,591
why don't you come over

522
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,546
and watch the game
and we'll have nachos

523
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,597
and then, some beer.

524
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,471
Oohh..

525
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,978
Jerry, I think
you and I

526
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,149
are going to
get along just...

527
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,098
-D'oh!
-D'oh!

528
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,283
