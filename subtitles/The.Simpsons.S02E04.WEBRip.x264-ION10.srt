I'm Dave Shutton.

that in my day,

75

such a shoddy, deplorable--

00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,185
Oh, look.

77
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,946

we leave the room

80
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,083

when we return,

81
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,210

will be gone.

are still here.

86
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,514
Burns, if
I didn't know better,

87
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,719
I'd think you were
trying to bribe me.

88
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,760
Is there some confusion
about this?

to overlook this felony.

However, I will not overlook
the 342 violations

92
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,227

at your plant today.

93
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,146
Either bring this place
up to code

94

shut it down.

cost to fix this place up?

You know, I was
just telling the wife

149
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,132
that if I was governor,
I'd do things a lot differently.

Oh, get off

it costs to run for office?

00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,215
More than any
honest man could afford!

153
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,715
I bet you could
afford it, though.

I mean, you're

157
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,475
I just meant
that you could afford

158
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,192
to run for governor
if you felt like it.

159
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,022
Of course,
I'm just rambling

160
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,397
because you keep staring at me
like that, but it's true.

161
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,315
I mean, if you were governor

162
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,163

177
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,939
MAN: Now, here's the problem
as I see it.

178
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,317
While Governor Bailey
is beloved by all

179
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,954
98% of the voters

180
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,871
rate you as
despicable or worse.

181
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,411
That's why we've assembled

182
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,454
the finest campaign team
money can buy.

183
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,788
This is your
speech writer

184
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,212
your joke writer,
your spin doctor

185
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,881
your makeup man
and your personal trainer.

186
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,881
{\an8}Their job-- to turn
this Mr. Burns

187
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,724
{\an8}into this.

188
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,969
{\an8}Why are my teeth
showing like that?

189
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,641
Because you're smiling.

190
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,639
Ah, excellent!

191
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,141
This is exactly the kind of trickery
I'm paying you for.

192
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,895
But-but how do we turn your average
Joe Six-pack against Mary Bailey?

193
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,059
With this team
of investigators--

194
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,107
your muckraker,
your character assassin

195
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,242
-your mudslinger, your garbologist.
-Hello.

196
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,409
Their job is
to turn Mary Bailey

197
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,568
{\an8}from this

198
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,446
{\an8}into this.

199
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,164
Ah, visually, it's helped so
much. Thank you.

200
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,245
But first
there's a burning issue

201
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,790
that we need to address and
neutralize immediately.

202
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,084
{\an8}BURNS:
D'oh!

203
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,417
I hate that fish.

204
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:51,303
MAN (on telvision): <i>Thank you for watching</i>
<i>Movie for a Dreary Afternoon.</i>

205
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,932
{\an8}<i>Please stay tuned for a paid</i>
<i>political announcement</i>

206
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,970
{\an8}<i>brought to you by the friends of</i>
<i>Montgomery Burns.</i>

207
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,313
Burns? Change the channel.

208
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,718
-You change it.
-No, you change it.

209
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,266
I changed it
last week.

210
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,639
Fine, be a jerk.

211
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,976
Then we'll just
sit here and watch it.

212
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,691
Oh, no, an election?

213
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,152
It's one
of those deals

214
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,862
where they close the bars,
isn't it?

215
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,072
Sorry, Barney.

216
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,782
I wonder if he's
going to say anything

217
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,572
about that
horrible fish?

218
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,075
Oh Marge, what's the big deal?
I'll bet before the papers

219
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,539
blew this out
of proportion

220
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,079
you didn't even know
how many eyes a fish had.

221
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,752
(irritated grunt)

222
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,420
30 seconds to air,
Mr. Burns.

223
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,708
Now, remember
to smile.

224
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,961
BURNS:
I am smiling.

225
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,463
You'll have to do
better than that.

226
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,304
(grunting)

227
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,669
How's this?

228
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,876
There you go.

229
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,965
I'm going to
be sore tomorrow.

230
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,721
Well, we've done
all we can, Mr. Burns.

231
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,802
-The rest is up to you.
-Oh, don't worry.

232
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,308
By the time this paid
political announcement is done,

233
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,270
every Johnny Lunchpail
in this whole stupid state

234
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,482
will be eating
out of my hand.

235
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,732
Oh, hello, friends.

236
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,783
I'm Montgomery Burns,
your next governor.

237
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:54,568
And I'm here to talk to you about
my little friend, here, Blinky.

238
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,124
Many of you consider him to be
a hideous genetic mutation.

239
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,449
Well, nothing could be
further from the truth.

240
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,204
But don't take
my word for it.

241
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:05,576
Let's ask an actor portraying
Charles Darwin what he thinks.

242
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,955
-Hello, Mr. Burns.
-Oh, hello, Charles.

243
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,342
Be a good fellow,
and tell our viewers

244
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,088
about your theory
of natural selection.

245
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,421
Glad to, Mr. Burns.

246
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,466
You see, every so often,

247
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,219
mother nature changes
her animals

248
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,221
giving them bigger teeth,
sharper claws, longer legs

249
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,724
or, in this case,
a third eye.

250
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,847
And if
these variations

251
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,234
turn out to be an improvement

252
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,560
the new animals
thrive and multiply

253
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,686
and spread across
the face of the Earth.

254
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,693
So you're saying this fish

255
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,235
might have an advantage
over other fish?

256
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,238
It may in fact,
be a kind of superfish.

257
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,281
I wouldn't mind having
a third eye. Would you?

258
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,195
(chuckles) No.

259
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:46,163
You see friends, if our anti-nuclear
nay-sayers and choose-up-siders

260
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,537
were to come upon an elephant
frolicking in the waters

261
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,084
next to our
nuclear power plant

262
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,957
they'd probably blame
his ridiculous nose

263
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,755
on the nuclear bogeyman.

264
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,009
The truth is, this fish
is a miracle of nature

265
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,222
with a taste
that can't be beat.

266
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,552
Mm-mmm!

267
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,057
So, to summarize...

268
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,929
say what you want about me.

269
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,515
I can take the slings
and arrows,

270
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:11,441
but stop slandering
poor, defenseless Blinky.

271
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,482
Good night
and God bless.

272
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:18,237
{\an8}<i>♪ Only a moron</i>
<i>wouldn't cast his vote ♪</i>

273
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,740
{\an8}<i>♪ for Mon-teee Burns! ♪</i>

274
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,834
Wow! Superfish!

275
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,909
I wish the government
would get off his back.

276
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,246
That Burns is just
what this state needs--

277
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,962
young blood!

278
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,842
I hope Burns and I can count
on your support, honey?

279
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,880
Homer, I'm
a Bailey booster.

280
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,434
Oh yeah? Well, I'm
a Burns booster. Ow!

281
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,009
Congratulations
Mr. Burns,

282
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,474
The latest polls show
you're up six points.

283
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,215
Ah. Giving me a total of...

284
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,637
Six, but
we're on our way.

285
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:53,056
MARY BAILEY: My worthy opponent
seems to think that the voters

286
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,017
of this state
are gullible fools.

287
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,647
I, however
prefer to rely

288
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,395
on their intelligence
and good judgment.

289
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,107
{\an8}Interesting strategy.
Good luck.

290
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,527
And I say taxes
are too high!

291
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,866
(cheering)

292
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,962
(crowd cheering)

293
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,382
(crowd cheering)

294
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,016
Have you found any dirt
on Mary Bailey?

295
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,232
Well, we've gone through
her garbage.

296
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,772
-We talked to her maid.
-And so far,

297
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,355
the only negative thing
we have found

298
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,820
was from some guy who dated
her when she was 16.

299
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:39,901
Ah! And?

300
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,145
He uh, he felt her up.

301
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,817
Bah!
Not good enough.

302
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:46,235
BURNS: <i>We're going to</i>
<i>send a message</i>

303
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:51,035
<i>to those bureaucrats down</i>
<i>there in the state capital!</i>

304
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,581
Is your boss
governor yet?

305
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,587
Not yet, son, not yet.

306
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,629
The voters now see you
as imperial and God-like.

307
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,384
Hot dog.

308
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,546
But there's a downside to it.
The latest polls indicate

309
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,255
you're in danger of losing touch
with the common man.

310
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,385
Oh, dear. Heaven forefend!

311
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,022
Which is why the night
before the election

312
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,270
we want you to have dinner at
the home of one of your workers.

313
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,193
Oh, I get your angle.

314
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,362
Every Joe Meatball
and Sally Housecoat

315
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,281
in this God-forsaken state
will see me

316
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,200
hunkering down for chow
with Eddie Punchclock.

317
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,780
The media will
have a field day.

318
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,286
CAMPAIGN MANAGER:
The only question is

319
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,158
can we find someone
common enough?

320
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,418
(belches)

321
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,631
Ugh.

322
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,969
Well, I-- I knew there
would be sacrifices.

323
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,180
(belches)

324
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,016
(crunching)

325
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,440
Oh, great toast, Marge!

326
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,320
Mmm. Oh, by the way,
the night before the election

327
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,528
-Mr. Burns is coming over for dinner.
-What?

328
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,029
And some reporters
and camera crew,

329
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,150
but you don't need
to feed them.

330
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,566
Cool man! A media circus.

331
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,824
Absolutely not.

332
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,316
Come on, Marge.

333
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,827
Mm-mmm, I'm going to be
ringing doorbells

334
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,369
for Mary Bailey that night.

335
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,452
D'oh!

336
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,946
Kids, please leave the room.

337
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,498
I don't want you
to see this.

338
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,331
Uh-oh.

339
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,416
Please, please, please,
please, please, please.

340
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,422
(irritated groan)

341
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,798
We're hoping that
one of the children

342
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,932
might pop up with a question
about the upcoming election.

343
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,549
Little girl, do you think you can
memorize this by dinnertime tomorrow?

344
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,927
"Mr. Burns, your campaign
seems to have

345
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,974
"the momentum
of a runaway freight train.

346
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,678
Why are you so popular?"

347
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,768
Very good.

348
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,852
Hmm. Well as long
as I'm asking something,

349
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,648
can I ask him
to assuage my fears

350
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,111
that he's contaminating
the planet

351
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,281
in a manner that may one day
render it uninhabitable?

352
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,950
No dear, the card
question will be fine.

353
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,278
Well, I think the non-card
question is a valid--

354
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,784
Marge!
Don't worry.

355
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,865
My daughter's very bright.
I'm sure she'll be able

356
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,121
to memorize your question
by dinnertime tomorrow.

357
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,253
And finally,
Mr. Burns wants you

358
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,960
to appear very
affectionate to him,

359
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,841
but we must remind you,
he hates being touched.

360
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:06,795
(grunts)

361
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,512
Mmm?

362
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,222
Marge, get back in bed.

363
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,302
{\an8}No, I'm just fine
right here.

364
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,968
What's wrong?
I just want to snuggle.

365
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,806
Well, I don't feel
like snuggling.

366
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,141
What's that got
to do with it?

367
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,476
I don't wanna snuggle
with anybody

368
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,020
who's not letting me
express myself.

369
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,484
But you do get
to express yourself,

370
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,734
and the lovely home you keep
and the food you serve.

371
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,648
Hmm. Okay, Homer.

372
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,566
Fair enough.
You got it.

373
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,906
All right.
Good. That's it.

374
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,372
That's how I'm going
to express myself.

375
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,951
That's right.
Good night.

376
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:36,996
Huh?

377
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,923
(TV crew chattering)

378
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,547
Well, what do
we think?

379
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,054
Hey, hello, handsome.

380
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,467
Hey, get that stuff
off his face.

381
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,806
We're here to have dinner
with a common man,

382
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,980
not Tyrone Power.

383
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,349
Latest polls are in.

384
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,686
It's dead even.
Fifty-fifty.

385
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,521
This cornball stunt is gonna
put us over the top.

386
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,855
Whoa, he's here!

387
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,113
(doorbell rings)

388
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,027
Hello, Homer.

389
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,577
Marge, you look dazzling.

390
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,331
Oh, and look,
I've brought noodle kugel.

391
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,208
(dog barks)

392
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,791
(Homer shouts)

393
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,586
Uh, bad dog!

394
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,209
Bad neighbor dog.

395
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,376
Here, let me
help you up, Mr. Burns.

396
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,585
Watch it.

397
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,304
I love dogs.
Babies, too.

398
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,255
-(meows)
-(crowd gasping)

399
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,595
Kitty, kitty.

400
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,811
Are you all right,
Mr. Burns?

401
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,402
Oh, of course. A little roughhousing with
the pets is good for a man's appetite.

402
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,146
The latest polls
are in.

403
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,776
The statesman-like way
you handled the pet incident

404
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:53,863
has put you over the top.

405
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,867
You're ahead, 51 to 49.

406
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,909
Congratulations,
"Mr. Governor."

407
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,203
Excellent.

408
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,906
Bart, would you
like to say grace?

409
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,877
Dear God... we pay for
all this stuff ourselves,

410
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,288
so thanks for nothing.

411
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,496
(gasping)

412
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,006
(chuckles nervously)
Only an innocent child

413
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,759
could get away
with such blasphemy.

414
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,180
God bless them all.

415
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,378
Amen.

416
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,758
(chuckling)

417
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,354
He's smokin', he's smokin'.

418
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,391
Um, you know, Mr. Burns...

419
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,940
-my family and I, um...
-(burps)

420
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,480
feel like taxes
are too high.

421
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,984
Where do you stand on this
highly controversial issue?

422
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,648
Goodness, I didn't realize
this casual dinner

423
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,197
was going to turn into
a charged political debate.

424
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,781
I was only reading
what the card--

425
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,656
Homer, I agree with you,
and if I'm elected governor,

426
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,714
I will lower taxes
whether those bureaucrats

427
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,129
in the state capital
like it or not!

428
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,958
Lisa, do you
have a question

429
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,963
you would like to ask
your Uncle Montgomery?

430
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,375
Yes, sir.
A very inane one.

431
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,974
(Lisa sighs)
Mr. Burns,

432
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,930
your campaign
seems to have the momentum

433
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,680
of a runaway freight train.

434
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,762
Why are you so popular?

435
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,428
Ooh, a tough question,
but a fair one.

436
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,767
Lisa, there's no
single answer.

437
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,063
Some voters
respond to my integrity.

438
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,147
Others are more impressed
with my incorruptibility.

439
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,323
Still others by my
determination to lower taxes,

440
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:18,073
and the bureaucrats in the state capitol
can put that in their pipes and smoke it!

441
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,697
Oh, Mom, that felt awful.

442
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,084
I'm sorry, dear.
It will all be over soon.

443
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,832
But Mom, we've become
the tools of evil.

444
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:29,334
Lisa, you're learning many
lessons tonight and one of them is

445
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,628
to always give your mother
the benefit of the doubt.

446
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,223
BURNS: ...or fair shake,
or even a square deal.

447
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,219
(sniffing)

448
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,300
Mmm! Smells delightful.

449
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,425
(everyone gasps)

450
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,265
All right--
three-eyed fish!

451
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,692
Can I have your plate,
Mr. Burns?

452
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,570
(shudders)

453
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,628
Ptui!

454
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:18,762
(everyone gasps)

455
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,892
-Get a shot.
-I can't believe it.

456
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,759
He's blown it for sure.

457
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,064
Ruined before it
hit the ground.

458
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,101
Get me the City Desk.

459
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,354
Here's your headline, Phil--

460
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,305
"Burns can't swallow
own story."

461
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,515
<i>The latest polls indicate</i>
<i>Burns' popularity</i>

462
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,896
<i>has plummeted to Earth</i>
<i>like so much half-chewed fish.</i>

463
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,244
You must have a few tricks
left up your sleeve.

464
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,490
Smithers, boil some coffee.
We're not licked yet.

465
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,583
Yes, we are. Come on, boys,
the old guy's finished.

466
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,829
Wait! Come back.
You can't do this to me.

467
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,922
I'm Charles Montgomery Burns!

468
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,253
(grunting)

469
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,219
(straining)

470
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,469
Smithers, tip over
this table for me.

471
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,591
Yes, sir.

472
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,888
Homer...

473
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,721
Homer, make them stop.

474
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,096
Ahem!
Uh, Mr. Burns?

475
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,183
Uh, Mr. Burns?

476
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,558
Shut up and wreck something!

477
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,515
Mr. Burns?
I hardly see

478
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,145
what destroying our
meager possessions

479
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,782
is going to accomplish.

480
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,068
She's right.

481
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,902
Take me home, Smithers.

482
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,068
We'll destroy
something tasteful.

483
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,082
Ironic isn't it, Smithers?

484
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,910
This anonymous clan
of slack-jawed troglodytes

485
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,617
has cost me the election,

486
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,877
and yet if I were
to have them killed,

487
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,499
I would be the one
to go to jail.

488
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,495
That's democracy for you.

489
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,667
You are noble and poetic
in defeat, sir.

490
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:44,176
Simpson, I shall make it
the focus of my remaining years

491
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:47,471
that your dreams
will go unfulfilled.

492
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,806
Uh-oh, you're busted, Dad.

493
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,191
HOMER: Oh. My dreams
will go unfulfilled?

494
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,109
Oh, no. I don't like
the sound of that one bit.

495
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,148
That means I have
nothing to hope for.

496
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,942
Marge, make it
better, please?

497
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,316
Can't you
make it better? Huh?

498
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,072
Homer, when
a man's biggest dreams

499
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,445
include seconds on dessert,
occasional snuggling,

500
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,993
and sleeping till noon
on weekends,

501
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,657
no one man can destroy them.

502
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,537
