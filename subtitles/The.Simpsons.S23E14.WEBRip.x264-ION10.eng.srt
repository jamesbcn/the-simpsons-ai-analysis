the moon back up.

{\an8}but I must again point out
there is no dragon.

35
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:52,046
{\an8}Then why am I paying
$800 a year in dragon insurance?

that money would be

71
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,269
{\an8}it might be cool
to see the town empty.

72
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,390
{\an8}Yeah, I could sneak into
the school and write whatever

73
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,147
{\an8}I want on the chalkboard!

74
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,899

marijuana!

76
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,649

80
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,660

90

{\an8}Yes, but the meetings last
eight hours!

91
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,034
{\an8}Shut up! Shut up!

92
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,819
{\an8}This is the most
fun I have!

93
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,907
{\an8}And now for the reason
we are here.

94
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,161
{\an8}What's going on?

95
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,952

a picture of us?

96
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:28,996
{\an8}This isn't good.

97
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,828
{\an8}Oh, honey,
why must you always assume

98
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,333
{\an8}that a huge picture of us

99
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,745
{\an8}at a secret meeting we weren't
told about is a bad thing?

100
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,455
The results are in: this town
has voted unanimously

101
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,626
to get rid of Springfield's
unending nightmare:

102
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,506
the Simpsons.

103
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,433

00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,601

The monsters are here!

105
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,560
Moe, it's me, Marge.

106
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,520
I'm your friend.

107
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,731
The monster queen
is coming on to me!

108
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,701
Why would you want
to banish us from Springfield?

109
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,159
Yeah.
We're like family to you.

110
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,579
I'm talking to you,
headphone-bus-driver guy.

111
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,369
I'll have you know
I'm also a hair donor!

112
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,504
Salma Hayek wore me
to the Oscars!

113
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,462
This is not about who wore
whose hair where.

114
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,633
We are here
to banish the Simpsons,

115
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,132
although we are not pleased
to be doing so.

116
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,965
-I am!
-Me, too.

117
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,890

120
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,557

to spare their feelings.

121
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,642
Those freaks have no feelings!

122
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,397

125
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,992
Why would an entire town
go to all this fuss

126
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,699
to get rid of one family?

127
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,069
What have we done
that's so terrible?

128
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,616
I'm glad you asked.

129
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,289
The simple fact is
the city is going broke

Mm-hmm.

141
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,306
We're not monsters.

142
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,854
We're just people.

143
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,187
People who love each other
and love this town,

144
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,864
(voice breaks)
the only place we've ever called home.

145
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,403
Thank you.

146
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,072
(sobs)

147
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,697
Marge, you are a sweet woman

148
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,953
and you make us see your family
in a more forgiving light.

149
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,246
Thank you.

150
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,669
Which is why you're
the worst Simpson of all!

151
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,418
-Huh?!
-ALL: Yeah, yeah!

152
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,380
Now, now, now
just a second here.

153
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,301
Now, I know we're not perfect.

154
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,719
but, uh, I believe it was
Sammy Hagar who said...

155
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,879
SIDESHOW MEL:
Silence!

156
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,927
D'oh!

157
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,010
That was an "inside me" bone!

158
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,306
(grunts)

159

160
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,059
Make way for Captain Coolerhead!

161
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,063
Now, I like a good old-fashioned
witch trial

162
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,935
as much as the next person,

163
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,022
but I do not think
we should be so quick

164
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,527
to judge our longtime
neighbors.

165
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,279
Not so fast, Flanders.

166
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,450
We knew you'd be
the voice of mercy,

167
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,699
and we're prepared
to answer your concerns.

168
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,782

00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,288

Burns and Smithers getup.

335
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,247
I mean, I'm not the sharpest
pencil in the... pencil thing,

336
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,869
but I'm least as smart as a cat.

337
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,075
-Right, Lou?
-Uh, what breed, Chief?

338
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,126
I mean, I saw an Abyssinian once
who could change channels.

339
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,880

340
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,302

throw us out of town again?

Crucify them!

343
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,893

344
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,640

Now, hold on
just a minute.

351
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,652
Nobody said anything
about shooting.

352
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,034
I did, just now.

353
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,070
That's right, you did.
Well, all right.

-(hammers cock)
-Okay.

355
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,366
Don't even bother
shooting us.

356
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,409
We've found a new
place that we love,

357
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,328
a place that may not
have indoor plumbing,

358
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,956

we treasure more.

Uh... it's okay.

365
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,639
In our new community,

366
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,312
people accept others
for who they are.

367
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,482
