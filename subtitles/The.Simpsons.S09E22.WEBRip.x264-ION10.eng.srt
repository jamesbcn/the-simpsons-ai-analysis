00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:03,245
(theme music playing)

00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:06,666
CHORUS: <i>♪ The Simpsons ♪</i>

3
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:07,756
(tires screeching)

4
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:11,342
D'oh! (screams)

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,598
(tires screeching)

6
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:15,716
Hmm?

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,490
{\an8}Gentlemen, I'm pleased
to report strong holiday sales

8
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,906
{\an8}from the Christmas/Hanu/Kwanza
spend phase,

9
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,615
{\an8}and things look good for
the mom/dad/grad gift corridor.

10
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,456
{\an8}Uh, then we'll have
the usual summer lull, but...

11
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,962
{\an8}Hey, we're making enough money, right?
(chuckles)

12
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,415
{\an8}(indistinct cough)

13
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,796
{\an8}Um, hey, hey, hey...

14
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,925
{\an8}OK, people, we need to cook up
a new holiday for the summer.

15
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:01,306
{\an8}Something with gifts, cards,
assorted gougeables.

16
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,104
{\an8}How about something religious?

17
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,148
{\an8}We had great penetration last spring
with "Christmas Two."

18
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,492
{\an8}Ooh, I know: "Spendover" like passover,

19
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,608
{\an8}but less talk, more presents.

20
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:10,574
{\an8}"Product day"?

21
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,913
{\an8}"Giftsgiving"?

22
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,738
{\an8}No, no, no! No, it's got
to be warm and fuzzy.

23
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:18,954
{\an8}Something like, um, "Love Day,"
but not so lame.

24
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,253
{\an8}Happy Love Day, everyone!

25
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,832
{\an8}LISA: Come on, Mom, the stores

26
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,837
{\an8}just invented this holiday to make money.

27
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,959
{\an8}Lisa, don't you ruin another Love Day.

28
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,046
{\an8}For you, Homie.

29
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,170
{\an8}(exclaims)

30
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,099
{\an8}<i>I'm Sir Loves-A-Lot,</i>
<i>the bear who loves to love.</i>

31
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,643
They didn't have Lord Huggington?

32
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,852
It's the same basic bear, Homie.

33
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,183
(sadly) I guess.

34
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,152
What the hell is this?

35
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,691
It's a kisses-make-me- boogie-o'-lantern.

36
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,185
Kiss it and make it boogie.

37
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,436
Kiss it.

38
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,278
Uh, maybe later.

39
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,948
(sniffs, slurps)

40
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,161
(dance music playing)

41
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,781
Oh! Oh, yeah!

42
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,947
Well, we better start our
Love Day cleanup.

43
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,866
You kids take care of the wrapping paper.

44
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,825
I'll dismantle Love Land.

45
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,325
(romantic music playing)

46
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,301
Oh, what a terrible waste.

47
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,803
Yes, but the memories
will last a lifetime.

48
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,926
Darn... crappy... stuff.

49
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,813
It's full, Dad. that means
you have to take out the trash.

50
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,061
Yep, that's the rule.

51
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,943
He who tops it off drops it off.

52
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,269
Nuh-uh. It isn't filled
until it's spilled.

53
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,315
(grunting)

54
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,150
<i>I wuv you...</i>

55
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,355
(grunts)

56
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,994
<i>-I wuv...</i>
-(grunts)

57
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,491
<i>-...wuv you.</i>
-(grunts)

58
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,083
(whistling)

59
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,793
(grunts)

60
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,666
(snickers)

61
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,881
{\an8}Ooh.

62
00:02:58,803 --> 00:02:59,803
Mm.

63
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,885
(chuckles)

64
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,557
D'oh!

65
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,153
MARGE: I heard that. You know the rule.

66
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,859
Oh... but I can rebuild.

67
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,110
(groaning)

68
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,493
Ow. Ow.

69
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:18,279
(muttering) Stupid trash,
rotten, stinky, hate world, revenge soon,

70
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,534
take out on everyone...

71
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,526
(screams)

72
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,867
Garbage water!

73
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,161
(groans)

74
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,754
You're pushing me, baby!

75
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,795
Hey, wait! Stop!

76
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,669
I have garbage!

77
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:40,891
D'oh! You guys are
the lousiest garbagemen ever!

78
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,640
Yeah, I'm talking to you!

79
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,812
You trash-eating stink bags!

80
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,231
(tires screech)

81
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,563
{\an8}Uh-oh.

82
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,654
(beeping)

83
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,898
What did you call us?

84
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,229
I don't know. A lot of people
were yelling stuff.

85
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,185
Yeah, you called us
"trash-eating stink bags."

86
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,066
Didn't you learn anything from Love Day?

87
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,703
That was yesterday, moron.

88
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,493
Good news, everyone.

89
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,413
I got in a fight with the garbagemen

90
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,242
and they're cutting off our service.

91
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,827
Oh, lord! Now what are we going to do?

92
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,543
Just let the trash pile up?

93
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,583
Hey, I'd rather live in a dump

94
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,797
than in a world run by snooty garbagemen.

95
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,918
{\an8}Dad, is this another one
of those situations

96
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,295
{\an8}that could be solved by a simple apology?

97
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,643
I never apologize, Lisa.

98
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,798
I'm sorry, but that's just the way I am.

99
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:23,927
(all chomping)

100
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,433
Sit down, honey.

101
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,426
The men will clear the table.

102
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,808
(grunts)

103
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,600
So long, chicken bone.

104
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,648
See you in hell, brussels sprouts.

105
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,651
No room for you, Jell-O.

106
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,613
Good-bye, fine china.

107
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,864
-(plate shatters)
-Bart!

108
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,703
Easy, Ned.

109
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,794
Don't breathe in.

110
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,289
(groans)

111
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,291
Sorry, Ned. I didn't see you down there.

112
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,674
Got him.

113
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,290
Uh, listen, Homer,

114
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,167
uh, hate to be a fussy Freddy and all

115
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,924
but Maude's folks are here

116
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,716
and, uh, they're a tad touchy about odors.

117
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,430
Then you might want to close your windows

118
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,720
before the sun hits diaper hill.

119
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,064
Look, Daddy! I'm king of the mountain.

120
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,601
NED: Rod, get off of there!

121
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,654
Three, two, one.

122
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,977
Go, go, go!

123
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,612
Ah. The rats seem happy.

124
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:28,452
Homer, that crazy lady who lives
in our trash pile attacked me again.

125
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,996
That's not how she tells it.

126
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,749
And the school nurse says
Bart has the plague.

127
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,882
It's like the measles.

128
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:34,998
Good to get it out of the way.

129
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,714
Homer, this has gone far enough.

130
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,045
Will you please just apologize
to the garbagemen?

131
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,222
Yeah, Dad, you're always
telling me and Bart to apologize.

132
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,852
{\an8}Yeah. But I'm always secretly
disappointed when you do.

133
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:50,139
Anyway, I think those garbagemen
are starting to crack.

134
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,984
I think you're starting to crack.

135
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,980
-Apologize for that remark!
-No way.

136
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,192
Attaboy.

137
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,395
(yawning)

138
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,443
Good morning, trash pile.

139
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,686
How's my...? Hey.

140
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,863
(whoops) I won!

141
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:08,737
This is a very, very proud day
for us, especially me.

142
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,406
Your father, me, beat city hall.

143
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,286
It's just like David and Goliath,

144
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,213
only this time David won.

145
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,421
(sighs)

146
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,211
LISA: <i>I know. I heard it, too.</i>

147
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,626
<i>Here's some music.</i>

148
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,962
(classical music playing)

149
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,553
And to think you wanted
me to crawl, Marge.

150
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,545
Well, this man doesn't crawl.

151
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,887
He stands tall.

152
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,891
That rhymes, Marge, and you know it
rhymes. admit it.

153
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,064
Oh, Homer, you didn't beat city hall.

154
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,193
They picked up our trash

155
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,899
{\an8}because I wrote a letter of apology

156
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,559
{\an8}to the sanitation commissioner

157
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,568
{\an8}and signed your name, period.

158
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,030
Wha...? You signed my name?

159
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,704
I feel so violated.

160
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,660
You've signed my name lots of times.

161
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,910
But this isn't like a loan application
or a will.

162
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,913
You signed away my dignity.

163
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,371
And I'm going to get it back.

164
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,826
Lisa, do I have my pants on?

165
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,997
-Yes.
-Perfect.

166
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,507
{\an8}Here's your apology back, Mr. Simpson,

167
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,589
{\an8}And I'm sorry we couldn't work this out.

168
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,675
Don't come off all high-and-mighty
with me, Patterson.

169
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,510
You can't scare me with your office

170
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,845
and your desk and your lamp.

171
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,560
I'm not trying to scare you.

172
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,140
I'm trying to get my work done.

173
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,765
Oh, oh, oh, I get it.

174
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,232
Put on a big show for the cameras.

175
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,521
What cameras? Why are you still here?

176
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,475
I came to fight city hall.

177
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,226
I want to shake things up, Patterson.

178
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,987
Stir up some controversy,

179
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,320
(mutters angrily)

180
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,275
Hey, stop that!

181
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,664
You'll never silence me.

182
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,580
I'm the last angry man, Patterson,
a crusader for the little guy!

183
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,701
(twittering)

184
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,077
Leave the bird alone!

185
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,254
Never!

186
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,041
Look, Simpson, I've been elected
by the voters of this city

187
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:45,046
16 years in a row, so they must think
I'm doing a damn good job.

188
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,221
You want to know what I think?

189
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,339
No. Nobody wants to hear the nonsensical
ravings of a loudmouth malcontent.

190
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,678
(gasps)

191
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,972
Well, we'll see about that.

192
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,523
(muttering)

193
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,519
Hey!

194
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,135
No cutting.

195
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:01,187
I want to register to run
for sanitation commissioner.

196
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,322
And tell the fat cats upstairs

197
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,529
things are going to change in this town!

198
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,570
OK, but this is where you register
as a sex offender.

199
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,994
Ah, geez, there's always a line.

200
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,502
Hey, everybody,vote for my dad,

201
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,964
Homer Simpson.

202
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,464
If you don't, he'll beat us.

203
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,955
Why, you little-- Uh...

204
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,008
No one's goingto beat you, son.

205
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,801
{\an8}You're going to get such a beating.

206
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,256
Hey, vote Simpson.

207
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,256
Hi. Nice to see you.

208
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,018
Thanks for coming out.

209
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,099
Keep putting on weight, huh?

210
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,234
Lenny, my man.

211
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,520
So, Homer, if we vote for you,
what are you going to do different?

212
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,565
{\an8}What am I, the answer man?
Just vote for me.

213
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:49,449
Hm. you know, I don't know Ray Patterson
but... he's no Ray Patterson.

214
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,319
Homer's a great nuclear safety inspector,

215
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,815
but I don't know if I'd trust him
with my garbage.

216
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,038
LENNY: That's a peace-of-mind issue,
you know?

217
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,498
These old geezers just don't get it.

218
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,249
it's time to rock the vote!

219

Hold on, people!

251
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,527
The man's talking about waste management.

252
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,359
That affects the whole damn planet.

253
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,368
Oh, here we go.

254
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,540
What do we say we slip out to Moe's
for a pint?

255
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,949
Can I come?

256
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,622
No.

259
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:31,212
Now, Homer, I hear Ray Patterson
is a fine public servant.

260
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,967
Why should the people of Springfield--

261
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,719

That's a good question, Bono.

You're the real lord of the dance, Homer.

274
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,374

HOMER: My campaign is a disaster, Moe.

280
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,965
I hate the public so much.

281
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,768
If only they'd elect me...

282
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,601
I'd make them pay!

283
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,057
Ah, Moe, how do I make them like me?

284
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,107
Uh, gee, you're kind of
all over the place, there, Homer.

285
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,362
You need to focus here.

286
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:37,243
You gotta think hard
and come up with a slogan

287
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,531
that appeals to all
the lazy slobs out there.

288
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,325
(whining) Oh, no...

289
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,829
Can't someone else do it?

290
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,660
"Can't someone else do it?"
That's perfect.

291
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,786
It is?

292
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,132
Yeah. Now get out there
and spread that message to the people.

293
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,459
Woo-hoo!

294
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,344
Oh, hey, you didn't pay for the beer.

295
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,594
Can't someone else do it?

296
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,803

297
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,883

300
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,387
Seriously, give me the money.

301
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,427
Fellow citizens...

302
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,175
How would you rate
the trash service in this town?

303
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,438
I would deem it excellent.

304
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,560
Uh... OK, it's excellent...

305
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,443
But aren't you tired of waking up early

306
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,235
and dragging the garbage to the curb?

307
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,319
-Oh, man, you got that right.
-Yeah.

308
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,034
That's so annoying in the morning.

309
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,954
Aren't you tired of having to peel

310
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,163

311
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,464

312
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,458
(nasally) I'll say.

313
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,829
Well, then...

00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,343
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

316
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,970
And can't someone else scoop out
that nasty kitty litter?

317
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,088
Yeah! someone else!

318
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,425
Someone else! yeah!

319
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,299
Well, Ray Patterson thinks
you should do it.

320

Animals are crapping in our houses
and we're picking it up.

321

322
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,773

323
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,563
That's not even Mexico.

HOMER: I'm sorry my opponent

330
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,785
didn't think enough of you
to show up for this debate.

331
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,960
I'm sure he had
more important things to do.

337
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,851

339
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,393
Hey, he got you there, Ray.

340
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,385
Oh, come on, people.

341
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,307
This man has promised
round-the-clock trash pickup.

342
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,396
That's impossible.

343
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,531
Not if we hire more men,

344
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,318
and my men will do all your messy jobs.

345
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,072
They'll wash your car, scrub your shower,

346
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,905
air out your stinkables.

347
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,030
(cheering)

348
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,866
Good point!

349
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,872
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

350
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,334
Then you better turn
up your hearing aid, pops.

351
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,214
Pops? I'm only two years older than you.

352
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:59,462
Do we want old man Patterson here
with his finger on the button?

353
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,007
What button?

354
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,760
What the hell are you talking about?

355
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,342
What-what-what-what button?

356
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,426
Where am I?

357
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,551
Who took my false teeth?

358
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,967
(laughing)

359
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,886
(calmly) All right, fine.

360
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:16,114
If you want an experienced public servant,
vote for me.

361
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,608
But if you want to believe
a bunch of crazy promises

362
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,652
about garbagemen cleaning your gutters

363
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,105
and waxing your car,

364
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:27,825
then, by all means,
vote for this sleazy lunatic.

365
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,911
(indistinct chattering)

366
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:35,995
{\an8}Woo-hoo!

367
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,593
{\an8}Aren't you going to buy it, Dad?

368
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,588
{\an8}Fifty cents? Not likely.

369
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,165
(whistling)

370
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,012
Hey, Ray, cleaning out the old office, eh?

371
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,314
If I hadn't already packed
my letter opener,

372
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,848
I'd give you such a stabbing.

373
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,351
Whoa, whoa, whoa. whoa, Ray.

374
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,064
Are we going to let politics
get in the way of our friendship?

375
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,145
{\an8}Friendship?

376
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:01,279
You told people I lured children
into my gingerbread house!

377
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,688
Yeah. That was just a lie.

378
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,357
Simpson, the American people

379
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,237
have never tolerated incompetence
in their public officials.

380
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:16,169
You are going to crash and burn,
my fat-headed friend.

381
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,628
See? We're still friends.

382
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,998
Come on, give us a cuddle.

383
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,261
Jean-Paul, how are the new uniforms?

384
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,799
Do they match the suede boots?

385
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,052
Beautiful.

386
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,803
Did you get the new trucks?

387
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,045
Are they amphibious?

388
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,176
Well, there's only one way to find out.

389
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,522
We can always buy more.

390
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,891
{\an8}Wow, Dad, you're really working hard.

391
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,476
Yes, I got to work hard, honey.

392
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,111
Daddy made a lot of crazy promises.

393
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,269
I'm really proud of you, Homie.

394
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,528
But can the garbage man really do
all the things you said?

395
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,571
Oh, the garbage man can, Marge.

396
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,493
The garbage man can.

397
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,541

(humming)

426
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,381
Simpson, you idiot!

427
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,131
You spent your entire
year's budget in a month!

428
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,513
Your department's broke!

429
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,260
Ooh! Oh, no!

430
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,684
Wait. I think I've got
the perfect solution.

431
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,522
You'd better, because those garbage men
won't work for free.

432
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,519
D'oh!

433
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,270
Oh, Patterson was right!

434
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,941
I'm crashing and burning!
Crashing and burning!

435
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,982
How could you spend
$4.6 million in a month?

436
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,857
They let me sign checks
with a stamp, Marge.

437
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,236
A stamp!

438
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,531
You know, Dad,
there's a lesson in all this.

439
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,325
Many cities have problems
with garbage disposal

440
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,159
and it's time we realized you can't just--

441
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,414
{\an8}Wait! Shut up!

442
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,406
{\an8}I just thought of something.

443
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,336
(tires screeching)

444
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,958
(whistling)

445
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,426
Morning, boys.

446
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,589
Where's our paychecks, you bum?

447
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,888
My men ain't working another minute
till we get paid.

448
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,345
Will cash be OK?

449
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,483
Will it?

450
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,689
Did I hear a, uh, briefcase opening?

451
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,018
OK, before I show you

452
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,567
who wants to guess how I got the money?

453
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,901
{\an8}-Dealing drugs?
-Drugs?

454
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,485
I'll have to say drugs, too.

455
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,450
Close, but you're way off.

456
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,837
HOMER: Look at that beautiful garbage.

457
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,049
Other cities don't want it

458
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,339
so they pay me to dump it
in this old abandoned mine.

459
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,723
That's awful!

460
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,470
I almost wish it were drugs.

461
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,592
Some of it is.

462
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,388
(clattering)

463
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,022
Good God, Homer!

464
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,689
You're turning our wonderful little town
into America's trash hole.

465
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:09,609
Marge! Ixnay on the ash-hole-tray.

466
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,690
{\an8}But, Dad, you can't cram garbage under
Springfield forever.

467
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,436
Sure, I can, honey-kitten.

468
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,703
I don't know how you did it, Homer,

469
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,326
but you certainly solved
that budget crisis.

470
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,615
(moist spurt)

471
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,205
What the hell is that?

472
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,504
Uh... Nothing.

473
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,878
Now, uh, you were saying how great I was?

474
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,005
(moist spurt)

475
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,184
(grunting)

476
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:44,433
What's this? Melon rinds, panty hose,
a term paper from Texas Tech?

477
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,808
Simpson, do you know anything about--

478
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,152
Dear Lord,

479
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,778
please take Mr. Bunny up to heaven.

480
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,529
-(rumbling)
-(all screaming)

481
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,451
Hey, Brandine,

482
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,492
I think I done busted my stink bone.

483
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,577
(rumbling continues)

484
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,214
(exclaims)

485
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,589
CROWD: Aye.

486
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,336
And all those opposed
to horsewhipping Homer Simpson?

487
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,835
Nay?

488
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,347
{\an8}And now, all in favor of
reinstating Ray Patterson?

489
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,930
(cheering)

490
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,140
(playing <i>Sanford and Son </i>theme)

491
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,647
Oh!

492
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,689
Oh... (chuckling)

493
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,864
Oh, gosh!

494
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,192
You know, I'm not much on speeches

495
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:41,197
but it's so gratifying to leave you
wallowing in the mess you've made.

496
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,491
You're screwed. Thank you. Bye.

497
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,946
(reprise of <i>Sanford and Son </i>theme)

498
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,872
He's right. He ain't much on speeches.

499
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,917
No, people, we are far from screwed.

500
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,211
(rumbling)

501
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,554
(gagging)

502
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,085
(people exclaiming in disgust)

503
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,379
The time for panic has come.

504
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:04,047
We must move forward and turn to
the town's all-purpose contingency plan.

505
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,637
You mean plan B?

506
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,888
Yes. B.

507
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,395
(munching)

508
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,821
I can't believe it's come to this.

509
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,565
Come to what?

510
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,739
Moving the whole town
five miles down the road.

511
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,070
It's crazy.

512
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,994
Yeah, it's something, all right.

513
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,744
So we transplant the town.

514
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,246
We're just going to trash
the new Springfield, too.

515
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,788
Yeah, but what are you going to do?

516
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,581
If you need me, I'll be at Moe's.

517
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,575
(grunts)

518
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,246
-Hi, Moe.
-MOE: Hey, Homer.

519
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,342
Do yourself a favor.

520
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,428
Don't turn around.

521
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,023

00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,387
{\an8}(anguished wailing)

523
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,145
{\an8}MAN: I told you not to turn around.

524
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,196
(theme music playing)

525
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,299
{\an8}Look, guys, I got a Springfield spoon

526
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,473
{\an8}for my spoon collection.

527
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,052
{\an8}Oh, here we go.

528
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,096
{\an8}How many spoons have you got now, Adam?

529
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,312
{\an8}Nine. if I didn't have
my spoons, I'd go insane.

530
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,483
{\an8}Can I see it?

531
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,268
{\an8}My spoon.

532
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,606
{\an8}-Oh!
-(spoon clangs)
