I'm gonna get him a present.

Well, Bart, your father built it,

76
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,025
and he did the very best he could.

00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,163

Get growing.

80
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,884
I'll tell you what,
why don't I spruce it up for you. Huh?

81
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,839
But you're an inside grown-up.

82
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,050
Moms can't build tree houses.

83
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,920
You realize that saying that

84
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,177
is gonna make this mom
work her keister off

85
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,549
to make you the best darn
tree house you ever saw!

86

Uh, uh...

105
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,530
Webster's Dictionary defines...

-elo... quently...

108

bomb like that.

109
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,037
Yeah.
I really feel badly for the guy.

115
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,467
Mm, the therapy hounds.

116
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,764
Oh, oh, I feel a little better.

117
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,638
Now release the real hounds.

120
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,856
It's a pretty good seminar this year.

121
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,357
Dad, what's wrong?
Did your speech go badly?

122
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,775
How do you know
something's wrong?

123
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,953
You're drinking from a can of corn.

124

{\an8}Hmm? Eh.

125
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,289
Aw, Dad,
do you know Barbra Streisand

126
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,622
once forgot the words to a song

127
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:36,037
and didn't perform in public again
for nearly three decades?

128
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,957
Yeah, but she still
had James Brolin to cuddle.

129
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,047
So, on a scale
of ten to ten, how'd you do?

130
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,633
Um...

131
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,548

138
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,071

I know what will cheer you up.

142
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,002
We'll go to the comedy club downtown.

143
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,172
Downtown?
With all those desperate addicts?

144
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:20,091
Oh, the city cleaned them up
and made them comics.

145
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,341
Cool!

146
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,262
Homie, you're gonna chuckle
your blues away.

147
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,392
This is the best kind of comedy.

148
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,429
-No writers.
-Amen to that, Marge.

149
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,393
And I appreciate this,
but I really resent

150
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,933
the two-drink minimum!

151
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,936
You always drink more
than two drinks.

152
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,898
But no one makes me.

153
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,478
Three Long Island iced teas, please.

154
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,067
Okay, we're gonna perform
a little improv.

155
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,691
First we need a location.

156
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,028
Uh, 40.7 degrees north latitude,

157
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,414
74 degrees west longitude.

158
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,781
Ah, yes, New York City.

159
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,197
Now we need a relationship
for me and Cathy here.

160
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,616
Loveless marriage!

161
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,714
(laughs)
Okay, I heard loveless marriage.

162
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,130
These guys are pros.

163
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,378
All they did was ask
for two premises.

164
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,050
That's two more
than you've asked for.

165
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,630
(sighs)
Oh, boy.

166
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,804
All right, all we need now
is an object.

167
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,053
Anyone.

168
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,644
(quietly)
Fear of public speaking.

169
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,811
Sorry, didn't hear that.

170
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,809
Oh... fear of public speaking.

171
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,772
Maybe he has trouble
talking in the dark.

172
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,813
Hey, Jerry, bring up number seven.

173
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:19,896

Okay, okay, okay, um...
fear of public speaking.

180
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,787
Well, that's not really an object,

181
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,249
but we'll make it work.

182
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,038
New York City, loveless marriage,

183
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,832
fear of public speaking.

184
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:41,415
They've pulled back the bow;
now let the arrow take flight.

185
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,632
You know,
I'm gonna move over a seat.

186
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:49,344
We now take you to an apartment
on 68th and Columbus Avenue.

Aw, for heaven's sakes, Cathy,
when we got married,

00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,443
you used to speak for hours.

194
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,896
But since we moved
to New York City, nothing!

195
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,317
-(crowd laughing)
-Wow. It all magically fits.

196
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,156
Come on, Cathy, say something!
Anything!

Yes, you did. Very nice.
Return to your seat immediately.

Wow. Wow.
These guys do everything I can't.

00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,474
Maybe they can teach me.

204
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,762

<i>I'll be worse off than ever.</i>

350
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,228
<i>He does know.</i>

351
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,389
<i>She knows I know!</i>

352
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,057
<i>(Homer and Marge scream)</i>

353
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,994
-Homer?
-(muffled) Aw, what?

354
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,858
I slept on it,
and I'm madder than ever.

355
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,145
Go get Bart.

356
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,358
Oh, my God, Marge,

357
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,317
you woke up with
morning-would-be-mad.

358
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,738
Okay,
I'll put this in your new language.

359
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,697
Location: Bart's room.

360
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,827
Action: bring him here.

361
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,174
Can I get a character, please?

362
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,499
Fine. Um...

363
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,924
A near-sighted Frankenstein.

364
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,173
Okay.

365
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,094
(growling)

366
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,299
Bride! Bride!

367
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,095
I do not look like
the Bride of Frankenstein.

368
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,889
Don't deny premise.

369
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,273
(growls)

370
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:55,599
(knocking on door)

371
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,686
(grunts)

372
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,360
BART:
Mom, can I come in?

373
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,230
You like your eggs
a little runny don't you?

374
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,147
-What?
-And your toast set at four,

375
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,355
with a little bit of butter?

376
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,605
Yeah!

377
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,196
Hash browns might be a little burnt.

378
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,202
I like 'em however you make 'em,
sweetie.

379
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,745
I just wanted to say

380
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,248
I'm sorry.

381
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,670
We all forget just how many
wonderful things you do.

382
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,039
Oh...
(gasps)

383
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,796
(voice breaking)
Y-You're making me cry.

384
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,089
-(sobs)
-And best of all,

385
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,802
you're as hot
as the day I met you.

386
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,643
(sobs)
Thank you!

387
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:32,469
That apology speech you wrote
worked like a charm, Pop.

388
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,426
Your mother can't resist
an apology

389
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,476
that comes
straight from the heart.

390
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,980
Of this box.

391
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,438
Oh, dear God,

392
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,404
this is not a Renaissance Faire, is it?

393
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:49,066
Uh, that's in two weeks,
Henry the Weight Problem. Ha!

394
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:52,576
Gee, I don't know if I belong here
with all this talent.

395
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,990
(goofy voice)
Hey, Reverend.

396
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,908
Why didn't the dinosaurs
make it on Noah's Ark?

397
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,456
(normal voice)
Ooh, I give up.

398
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,419
(goofy voice)
Because they didn't exist.

399
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,960
(laughter)

400
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,473
(carnival music plays)

401
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,638
Dad, this festival
encourages experimentation.

402
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:10,968
Even failure.

403
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,933
Oh, what if I don't fail?

404
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,773
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

405
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,478
I am getting a helium balloon.

406
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,938
That makes anyone funny.

407
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,058
(high helium voice)
Be right back!

408
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,395
(Homer retching)

409
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,691
{\an8}Homer, are you okay?

410
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:28,195
{\an8}You look exactly like
Barbara Streisand did in 1967.

411
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,318
I can't think of anything funny.

412
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,366
Homer, Homer, relax,
you're a riot.

413
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,909
Remember how funny you was when
you was the confident Cajun?

414
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,155
Look, just let me
feed you the prompt.

415
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,497
Wait, you mean cheat at improv?

416
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,132
What would Del Close say?

417
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,169
He would say, "Do like Moe says,
and shut the hell up."

418
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,884
Who's Del Close?

419
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,474
{\an8}Only the author of the best book
I intend to read someday.

420
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,891
Homer, the cemeteries
are filled with people

421
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,720
who didn't cheat at improv.

422
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,555
Hmm.

423
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,396
Okay, let's go over what you're
gonna call out one more time.

424
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,322
Uh, ethnicity: Cajun.

425
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,031
Location: back alley.

426
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,321
Good, good.

427
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,664
The back alley Cajun bit.

428
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,159
LISA: (high helium voice)
Dad!

429
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,160
Are you cheating
by planting suggestions?

430
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,373
-Maybe.
-(gasps)

431
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,834
(normal voice)
Have you learned nothing

432
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,463
from owning an unread copy
of <i>Truth in Comedy?</i>

433
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,381
It's either that or quit the show.

434
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,340
You can't let your troupe down.

435
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,170
They need your space work,
your strong choices

436
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,006
and scene-building skills.

437
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,681
Hey, lay off your dad, huh?

438
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,930
Everything that's
supposedly spontaneous

439
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,432
has already been planned, okay?

440
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:39,523
Reality shows, uh,
lip-sync singing, even...

441
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,850
(dramatic voice)
award shows.

442
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,354
No!

443
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,766
Yes.
That's why the losers don't show up.

444
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,315
B-B-But they have scheduling conflicts.

445
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,608
Yeah, right.

446
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,941
Dave Franco has a scheduling conflict.

447
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,398
No, no, I've heard enough.

448
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,868
I refuse to use
performance enhancing "sugs."

449
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,038
-(murmuring)
-It's Homer Simpson.

450
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,539
Homer Simpson's here.

451
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,371
(crowd continues murmuring excitedly)

452
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,576
Okay, everyone, I'm Homer Simpson,

453
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,496
and I need an occupation.

454
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,915
Cadaver salesman?

455
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,713
Drive-thru cashier.

456
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,547
Uh, frog gigger.

457
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,762
Finger kisser! Mwah!

458
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,011
Nurse.

459
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,683
You'll have to be more specific.

460
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,681
I need a nurse!

461
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,223
Back alley Cajun!

462
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,216
Mm-hmm!

463
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,557
Ah...

464
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,982
A father I can look up to.

465
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,981
Oh. Um, uh...

466
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,734
I hear... drive-thru cashier!

467
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,567
BOTH:
You wha...?!

468
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,862
Hello, welcome
to "Down-and-Out Burger."

469
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,026
Would you like fries with that?

470
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,414
-(laughter)
-A thousand?

471
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,740
Sure thing, Mr. Brando.

472
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,156
By the way, this is 1992.

473
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,535
(Homer chuckles, crowd laughing)

474
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,130
And now we're gonna do
something a little special.

475
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,802
Our father is gonna improv
live answers to questions

476
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,432
from the TV audience.

477
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,809
It only took us 27 years to do
what they could do in 1954.

478
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,678
Homer, time to bomb.

479
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,520
Hello! I've gathered you here

480
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,191
because I have
an important announcement.

481
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,360
This is the last episode
of <i>The Simpsons.</i>

482
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,609
It's been a good run--

483
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,821
Ah, just kidding!

484
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,610
<i>The Simpsons</i> will never end!

485
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,114
But I do have bad news.

486
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,445
If you're seeing this,

487
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,070
{\an8}something has gone
horribly, horribly wrong.

488
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,578
{\an8}Or you're watching
the international version.

489
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,580
{\an8}In either case,
I have three minutes to fill.

490
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,043
And I can think of no better way
to fill that time

491
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,844
than to throw my hat into the ring
for U.S. President.

492
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,799
I have no previous experience,
no endorsements,

493
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,301
and no idea
when the election is.

494
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,473
That makes me
the most qualified.

495
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,892
By far.

496
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,890
I can beat Trump and Clinton
and Sanders.

497
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,273
Stupid Sanders.

498
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,270
I will make America great again.

499
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,062
Then not so great.

500
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,476
I will keep you on your toes.

501
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,225
I will not run for a second term.

502
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,817
I will walk.

503
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,322
I will drill, baby, drill,

504
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,033
until I find
the river of chocolate

505
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,704
that lies beneath
Hershey, Pennsylvania.

506
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,953
I will not only leave Gitmo open,

507
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,657
I will open Gitmo's tavern.

508
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:11,538
I believe that no one,
whatever his or her gender,

509
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:15,167
should have to use
the bathroom after I do.

510
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,915
I am a winner!

511
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,677
If the superdelegates oppose me,

512
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,429
I will destroy them with kryptonite.

513
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:25,271
{\an8}I plan to win on the first,
second, and third ballots.

514
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,929
{\an8}Maybe take a breather
on the fourth,

515
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,647
{\an8}and come back strong
on the fifth.

516
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,018
{\an8}And I'll get rid of
the boring Olympic events.

517
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,816
Like all of them.

518
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,190
I will increase American exports,

519
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,697
starting with my two stupid
sister-in-laws.

520
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,370
Uh...

521
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,448
sister-in-laws...?

522
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,663
Let's just call them
"American Uglies."

523
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,905
Soon to be "Canadian Sevens."

524
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,997
I would also like to apologize

525
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,883
for the horrible thing

528
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,427
and I trust it's not too late.

529
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,009
{\an8}In conclusion,
God bless America,

530
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,175
{\an8}and God bless Springfield,
in the beautiful state of--

531
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,885
{\an8}Oh, wait.
I'm afraid my time is up.

00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,694
-(crowd murmuring)
-Shh!
