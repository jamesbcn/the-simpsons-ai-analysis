Ooh! A budding new friendship?
Oh!

75

Boy, how come you can't

77

83

84

the middle child?

85
00:05:33,073 --> 00:05:35,908
Yeah. In the car, I always
have to sit on the hump.

86
00:05:35,929 --> 00:05:37,441

MARGE:

88
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:42,499

put melted butter on them!

90
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:49,263
Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom. I'll
tell Lisa you dropped by.

91
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:50,175
I better go.

92
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:51,768
Okay, but one more thing:

93
00:05:51,781 --> 00:05:55,069
I noticed we're both doing presentations
on Franklin Roosevelt at school.

94
00:05:55,098 --> 00:05:56,411
Why don't we do them together?

95
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:59,774
(quietly): Oh, my God. Someone
wants to be my partner.

96
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,562

(clears throat)

101
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:17,486
Franklin Roosevelt bravely instituted a
series of reforms called the New Deal.

102
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:21,298
Which ran totally counter to America's
tradition of limited government.

103
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:24,074
P.S. It was also
unconstitutional.

104
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:25,143
Oh?

105
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:31,112
Um, FDR's steadfast leadership also
helped America win World War Two.

106
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,061
Until the weak-kneed Democrats
sold us out at Yalta.

107
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,674
If you haven't guessed,
Lisa, I'm a Republican.

108
00:06:36,703 --> 00:06:38,770
- A Lincoln Republican?
- Not really.

109
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,743
- A Reagan Republican?
- Keep going.

110
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:41,887

111
00:06:41,913 --> 00:06:43,683

113
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:53,362

see you thoroughly de-high-horsed.

114
00:06:53,387 --> 00:06:54,698

118

are you saying?

119
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:07,218

heritages, I'm not pigeonholing...

121
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,241

Yes. Why?

130

00:09:19,421 --> 00:09:21,689
My mom says you're just going
through a liberal phase.

176
00:09:21,712 --> 00:09:25,316
What?! My mom says you're going
through a conservative phase.

177
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:28,181
There's no such thing. Conservatives
only get more conservative.

178
00:09:28,227 --> 00:09:31,052
Because every year, they get a little
further through <i>Atlas Shrugged.</i>

179
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:33,364
Listen, we're both
eight years old.

180
00:09:33,392 --> 00:09:35,458
Can't we just play
Monopoly or something?

181
00:09:35,485 --> 00:09:37,690
My father owns a monopoly!

182
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:42,436
(whirring)

183
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:51,023
That young filly is exactly the kind of
candidate we need to start recruiting!

184
00:09:51,052 --> 00:09:54,508
She's a young, dynamic <i>Latina.</i>

185
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,974
Yee-haw! I said that just right!

186
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:02,066
Without the Hispanic vote, even
Texas is poised to turn blue.

187
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,027
Blue!

188
00:10:03,047 --> 00:10:08,261
Yeah, we must reach her and groom her
before she fattens up like Chris Christie.

189
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:11,318
He thinks GOP stands for
"Gravy on Pancakes."

190
00:10:11,366 --> 00:10:12,735
(laughter)

191
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,529
But despite my mirthful remarks,
obesity is no laughing matter.

192
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:24,135
(chuckles)

193
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,541
Just can't resist those
words, "sign-up sheet."

194
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:30,547
Oh, looks like I'll be
running against Isabel.

195
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:31,978
And Ralph?

196
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:34,033
Just call me Ralph Nader.

197
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:35,940
- I don't know why.
- Isabel!

198
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,024
I want this campaign
to be about the issues:

199
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:42,080
same-sex field trip buddies, providing
class pets with a path to citizenship...

200
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:44,029
And no digging up
past relationships.

201
00:10:44,056 --> 00:10:46,944
Sure, Lisa and I dated.
Sure, she broke my heart.

202
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:49,497
I'm sure your researchers
know all about it.

203
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:53,215
- This is the first I've heard of it.
- Really? But I got this!

204
00:10:53,271 --> 00:10:54,377
Ew.

205
00:10:54,402 --> 00:10:56,882
How long has it been since
you washed your stomach?

206
00:10:56,892 --> 00:10:58,832
You can't ask that anymore!

207
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:00,334
(chuckles nervously)

208
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:01,501
Quit shoving!

209
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,503
I'd like a word
with you, young lady.

210
00:11:03,521 --> 00:11:06,018
- How did you get in there?
- Slid in through the grates.

211
00:11:07,723 --> 00:11:09,004
Here's the scoop.

212
00:11:09,025 --> 00:11:12,250
You're our future, so we can't
afford to have you lose.

213
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:16,517
And I love the Spanish... from the
Inquisition to the delightful Franco years.

214
00:11:16,537 --> 00:11:18,235
What are you talking about?

215
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:20,688
Move over! I know how
to talk to kids.

216
00:11:20,707 --> 00:11:22,847
We want to give you
a little present.

217
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:26,733
A tainted victory that
will haunt you forever.

218
00:11:27,364 --> 00:11:29,553
I'd rather do this myself.

219
00:11:29,668 --> 00:11:31,143
But who'd own you then?

220
00:11:31,161 --> 00:11:34,296
You couldn't buy me with a
wheelbarrow full of ice cream.

221
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,217
Whoa, nicely done.

222
00:11:39,254 --> 00:11:43,480
You've charmed another one right into
the arms of the Libertarian Party.

223
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,602
Maybe we can help her without
her knowing we're helping her.

224
00:11:47,277 --> 00:11:49,955
No one says I can't buy
a second grade election.

225
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:52,514
Why, I had enough money to fix
<i>People Magazine's</i>

226
00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:54,468
Sexiest Man Alive.

227
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:57,530
Most of the money went to
convincing them that I was alive.

228
00:12:00,072 --> 00:12:02,070
Who ordered the Yumboni?

229
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:04,907
Right here! Now, Smithers, I
want you to eat this for me.

230
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:08,137
Describe every taste. And don't
forget the brain freeze.

231
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:10,227
Sir, I am lactose-intolerant.

232
00:12:10,254 --> 00:12:12,660
And I'm back-talk-allergic!
So start eating!

233
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:13,827
(groans)

234
00:12:15,324 --> 00:12:16,868
Have a great day, kids.

235
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:20,566
And, Bart, I'll pick you up after
school to take you to karate lessons.

236
00:12:20,581 --> 00:12:24,988
Mom, after six weeks, I figured out that
Sensei Weinstein is really my psychiatrist.

237
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:29,049
Either way, for 45 minutes,
you're not my problem, sweetie.

238
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:31,285
(horn honking)

239
00:12:31,313 --> 00:12:32,371
(gasps)

240
00:12:32,402 --> 00:12:36,741
Don't worry, Lisa, despite the paid
ad, I am strictly middle of the road.

241
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,498
Idiot!
(horns honking)

242
00:12:38,528 --> 00:12:39,527
Pick a lane!

243
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:40,796
(tires screech)

244
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,136
Wha...?!

245
00:12:47,235 --> 00:12:48,594
What are you doing?!

246
00:12:48,621 --> 00:12:50,265
I'm as bewildered as you are.

247
00:12:50,277 --> 00:12:53,384
I don't know why, but the Springfield
Republican Party is grooming me.

248
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:55,735
Grooming? Yuck!

249
00:12:56,127 --> 00:12:58,053
Unfortunately, I can't stop it.

250
00:12:58,088 --> 00:13:00,757
The Supreme Court says
spending money is free speech.

251
00:13:00,785 --> 00:13:02,586
Well, then you could use
your free speech

252
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:05,609
to denounce this intrusion of
big money into our election.

253
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:09,177
Mm, I'll think about it while I'm on
my listening tour of the cafeteria.

254
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:18,184
(slurring):
Pour me another.

255
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,010
What are you doing?
It's imaginary.

256
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:23,323
Fine.

257
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:24,563
I got to go.

258
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,437
I'll see you later.

259
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:32,375
(humming a tune)

260
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:40,361
(grunting)

261
00:13:42,736 --> 00:13:43,905
BART: 
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

262
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,428
Bart, I need you to help
me win the election.

263
00:13:46,446 --> 00:13:48,384
I can help, but it's
gonna get rough.

264
00:13:48,405 --> 00:13:51,136
- I'm fine with rough.
- You don't know what rough is.

265
00:13:51,176 --> 00:13:54,062
That ain't rough. 
More like a gentle breeze.

266
00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:55,485
Maggie hits harder.

267
00:13:55,498 --> 00:13:58,064
Did the good night pixie
just kiss my cheek?

268
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:01,117
Ow! Okay, you got my attention.

269
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:02,551
You want to win this election?

270
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:04,967
Then from now on, you
do exactly what I say.

271
00:14:04,995 --> 00:14:06,058
You got it.

272
00:14:06,073 --> 00:14:07,901
First, go make me
five pans of brownies.

273
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:10,412
You're just taking advantage
of the situation.

274
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:12,368
Hmm, maybe Isabel likes baking.

275
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:14,174
Cakey or gooey?

276
00:14:14,566 --> 00:14:16,415
I'll make both.

277
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:20,170
First, we reel them in.

278
00:14:20,187 --> 00:14:22,376
Then, we scare the
hell out of them.

279
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,512
By discussing the
school's budget crisis?

280
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,913
No, with balls to the head.

281
00:14:27,111 --> 00:14:27,974
(blows whistle)

282
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:29,246
Bombardment!

283
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:36,806
I associate Isabel with
a pain in my tummy.

284
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:40,388
Bombardment?

285
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:41,477
(groans)

286
00:14:41,835 --> 00:14:46,579
Miss Simpson, your platform calls for
the creation of a student-run garden.

287
00:14:46,609 --> 00:14:48,843
Organic gardening is
an essential part

288
00:14:48,866 --> 00:14:51,714
of 21st century education,
teaching both hands-on...

289
00:14:51,736 --> 00:14:55,085
And what programs would you cut to pay
for this precious garden of yours?

290
00:14:55,123 --> 00:14:57,573
The new Wiffle bats?
Pizza Friday?

291
00:14:57,595 --> 00:15:00,083
(gasps)
Not Pizza Friday!

292
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:02,321
Sorry, Lisa, you lose again.

293
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:03,605
(air horn blares)

294
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:05,644
You got to get on
your game, sister.

295
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:09,519
You think I'm tough? Wait till
Gutiérrez sinks her teeth into you.

296
00:15:09,557 --> 00:15:11,238
Remember, you got
an ace in the hole:

297
00:15:11,251 --> 00:15:13,930
chocolate milk
in the water fountains.

298
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,125
That's impossible.

299
00:15:15,143 --> 00:15:18,375
We've already had the best
plumbers in the city look into it.

300
00:15:18,402 --> 00:15:20,937
Hey, we'll worry about
that after you're elected.

301
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:23,486
- (groaning)
- (whistling)

302
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,992
What are you so happy about?

303
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:28,352
It's in the bag, Lis.
Once everybody sees this.

304
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:32,306
Training wheels. She still
uses training wheels.

305
00:15:32,328 --> 00:15:33,462
(snickers)

306
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:34,815
And watch this.

307
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:39,642
(crying)

308
00:15:39,776 --> 00:15:41,215
Excellent.

309
00:15:41,246 --> 00:15:42,674
What am I doing?

310
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,493
Untent! Untent!

311
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:48,104
Oh, Bart, I want to
win, but not like this.

312
00:15:48,301 --> 00:15:50,068
I'm sorry, you're fired.

313
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,118
Leave the bottle.

314
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:58,879
I bet by the end of the night,
you're gonna look pretty good.

315
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,692
Welcome to our first in a
series of 37 debates...

316
00:16:02,723 --> 00:16:06,237
good Lord... before the
elementary school elections.

317
00:16:06,274 --> 00:16:07,647
You're a booger head!

318
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:12,804
And I say we move beyond name-calling
to solve our real problems.

319
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,189
(all booing)

320
00:16:14,218 --> 00:16:15,559
Booger head!

321
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:18,376
Vote for whoever you want to.
To me, these are both losers.

322
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:24,980
Now, the second grade debate between
Isabel Gutiérrez and Lisa Simp-a-son.

323
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,245
Sounds weird.

324
00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:27,296
Mm.

325
00:16:27,657 --> 00:16:28,857
ISABEL:
<i>Ivy Agee,</i>

326
00:16:28,886 --> 00:16:31,188
Frank Marino, Glen Gloyd.

327
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:34,086
These are men who
fought at Omaha Beach.

328
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:37,454
And they are the reason I'm
running for second grade rep.

329
00:16:37,475 --> 00:16:39,733
<i>Dios los bendiga a todos.</i>

330
00:16:39,762 --> 00:16:40,812
(students cheering)

331
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,048
I'll bet my bologna sandwich
that girl's gonna win.

332
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:45,929
Oh, a little rich
for my blood, sir.

333
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:49,090
Yes, you can fog a mirror, Seymour,
but I wouldn't call you alive.

334
00:16:49,116 --> 00:16:52,176
Now, the other candidate,
Lisa Simpson.

335
00:16:52,572 --> 00:16:54,516
Okay, I'm a liberal.

336
00:16:54,558 --> 00:16:56,726
And sometimes that's
a dirty word.

337
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,229
(laughter)

338
00:16:58,254 --> 00:16:59,035
Liberal.

339
00:16:59,062 --> 00:17:02,043
But what liberal really means
is someone who believes

340
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:06,184
that those who have more than enough should
share a little with those who don't.

341
00:17:07,237 --> 00:17:10,406
And those principles have
consistently been in place

342
00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:13,213
during this country's
most prosperous times.

343
00:17:13,238 --> 00:17:16,174
So if that's a liberal,
then I am a liberal.

344
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,367
And hang me.

345
00:17:17,441 --> 00:17:18,266
(screams)

346
00:17:18,314 --> 00:17:22,130
Sorry, we're just setting up for
<i>An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.</i>

347
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:29,286
(groaning)

348
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,770
Ooh.

349
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:33,690
The Democratic Party pantheon.

350
00:17:33,713 --> 00:17:35,614
Such lofty ideals.

351
00:17:35,783 --> 00:17:36,648
(gasps)

352
00:17:36,674 --> 00:17:37,994
And here come the spirits.

353
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:41,805
Michael Dukakis, Walter
Mondale, John Kerry?

354
00:17:41,815 --> 00:17:43,551
These are all losers!

355
00:17:43,578 --> 00:17:46,615
I'm afraid you're heading
for a loss, Lisa.

356
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:49,172
And when we lose, we lose big.

357
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:52,820
What about Obama? Harry Truman?
Bill Clinton?

358
00:17:52,856 --> 00:17:54,412
Lisa, you're a lot like me.

359
00:17:54,434 --> 00:17:58,077
Play the saxophone, come from a small
town, raised by a mother with no help.

360
00:17:58,092 --> 00:17:59,942
So, do you know how I can win?

361
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:03,239
I don't even know why I'm a ghost.
All these guys are alive.

362
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:06,723
John Kerry here is Secretary of State.
Doing a bang-up job.

363
00:18:06,758 --> 00:18:10,733
Well, we still have a long way
to go on Asian currency issues.

364
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:11,721
Absolutely.

365
00:18:11,747 --> 00:18:13,576
And, Lisa, I'm only
appearing in this dream

366
00:18:13,587 --> 00:18:16,318
so I can visit with you about
the Clinton Global Initiative.

367
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:19,127
See, our mission is to
turn ideas into action.

368
00:18:19,145 --> 00:18:20,700
And to find innovative
solutions that will hel...

369
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,270
- (snoring)
- Hey, hey, hey!

370
00:18:22,283 --> 00:18:23,753
You can't fall
asleep in a dream!

371
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:25,442
(snoring)

372
00:18:25,526 --> 00:18:26,493
(groans)

373
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:28,040
I know what I've got to do.

374
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:30,552
Hello, Isabel? Listen...

375
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:31,838
(snores)

376
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:33,685
(groaning)

377
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,470
CGI also convenes CGI America,

378
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,790
a meeting devoted to economic
recovery and job creation.

379
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:41,396
You used to be fun!

380
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,318
Kevin Costner used
to be a movie star.

381
00:18:43,342 --> 00:18:44,342
Get over it.

382
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:46,672
And now for their final debate,

383
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:49,253
please welcome,
uh, Li... um...

384
00:18:49,274 --> 00:18:52,880
Li-sa? Li-sa, uh, Simpsone.

385
00:18:52,908 --> 00:18:53,755
Yes.

386
00:18:53,768 --> 00:18:58,122
And, uh, Isabel
Adolpho-Guzman-Lopez Gutiérrez.

387
00:18:58,158 --> 00:18:59,358
Uh, ladies.

388
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:05,165
(grunts)

389
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:08,104
I just want to say, I don't
care about politics,

390
00:19:08,122 --> 00:19:10,579
electioneering or
negative campaigning.

391
00:19:10,603 --> 00:19:13,253
If my friend Lisa
wins, so be it.

392
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:15,583
(speaks Spanish)

393
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:16,493
(cheering)

394
00:19:16,512 --> 00:19:18,509
And I also want
to say that if...

395
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:19,547
- Time's up.
- But I...

396
00:19:19,568 --> 00:19:20,868
Stop showboating.

397
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:22,827
(grunts)

398
00:19:24,673 --> 00:19:27,604
Back in the banner shed you go.

399
00:19:28,143 --> 00:19:29,031
SKINNER:
<i>Good morning.</i>

400
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:32,347
We have completed the tally of the
votes for class representative.

401
00:19:32,374 --> 00:19:35,521
<i>One brief announcement: the tainted
Greek salad has given several students</i>

402
00:19:35,544 --> 00:19:37,977
<i>nightmares involving
Michael Dukakis.</i>

403
00:19:38,015 --> 00:19:41,715
It may recur tonight, so if possible,
have your parents strap you to the bed.

404
00:19:41,754 --> 00:19:43,248
<i>And now the results.</i>

405
00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:46,851
<i>First grade rep... results delayed
indefinitely due to jelly on the ballots.</i>

406
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:47,851
<i>Second grade rep...</i>

407
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,586
- <i>Isabel Gutiérrez.</i>
- (grunts)

408
00:19:49,617 --> 00:19:52,611
- <i>Third grade rep, no votes cast. Fourth
grade rep...</i> - Congratulations, Isabel.

409
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,705
- <i>last name Weiner, first name Ima...</i>
- I truly hope you enjoy the Friday

410
00:19:54,723 --> 00:19:56,465
- morning council meetings.
- <i>Simpson!</i>

411
00:19:56,477 --> 00:19:59,633
(crying): And the-the free
snicker doodle cookies.

412
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:01,338
Smithers, we won!

413
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:03,390
Drop the balloons!

414
00:20:03,857 --> 00:20:05,266
Ow! Ow! Ooh!

415
00:20:08,187 --> 00:20:09,782
Can I at least
remove the balloons?

416
00:20:09,815 --> 00:20:11,665
- Do it and you'll kill him.
- (groans)

417
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:14,305
- Hey, Lis.
- Hey.

418
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:15,703
I'm sorry I fired you.

419
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:17,150
Eh, no hard feelings.

420
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,956
A lot of good things have
been happening to me.

421
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,956
Mm-hmm.

422
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:20,922
Thanks, Bart.

423
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,600
I think you might feel better if
you looked at these exit polls.

424
00:20:24,653 --> 00:20:27,026
They find me a
pointy-haired know-it-all.

425
00:20:27,045 --> 00:20:30,023
Yes, but they agreed with
everything you said.

426
00:20:30,057 --> 00:20:31,307
What are you getting at?

427
00:20:31,328 --> 00:20:34,266
53% said they'd
vote for a liberal.

428
00:20:34,284 --> 00:20:35,766
Just not you.

429
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,959
Huh. You hear that, world?

430
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,909
They love my ideas, just not me!

431
00:20:40,928 --> 00:20:43,551
And that is half the battle!

432
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:44,614
Ha!

433
00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:47,012
Hello, I'm elder
Anderson Cooper.

434
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,613
Welcome to our first debate between
Republican Isabel Gutiérrez

435
00:20:50,647 --> 00:20:55,021
and Lisa Simpson, representing the
Democratic Robot Zombie Coalition.

436
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:59,796
First question: Ms. Simpson, what would
you do to get America out of Afghanistan?

437
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:03,284
I'd just throw in the towel
and make it a state.

438
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,605
That's our girl.

439
00:21:05,634 --> 00:21:06,770
(toots twice)

Shh!
