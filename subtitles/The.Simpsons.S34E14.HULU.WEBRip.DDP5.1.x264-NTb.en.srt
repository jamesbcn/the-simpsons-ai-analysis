00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,030
I mean, I was a lost soul

179
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:05,972
before I found this white shirt
and blue pants.

180
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:08,781
Let's find the outfit
that'll make Naima look at me

181
00:08:08,777 --> 00:08:10,877
the way that Marge looks at you.

182
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:11,621
Worried?

183
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,086
Blindly in love.

184
00:08:13,086 --> 00:08:15,286
♪ You're so chic ♪

185
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,490
♪ Oh, I love the way you do it ♪

186
00:08:17,494 --> 00:08:18,104

190

(record scratch)

191
00:08:25,544 --> 00:08:26,314
Who said you could do

192
00:08:26,312 --> 00:08:28,782
a dressing room montage
in my store?

193
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:30,154
If you're not gonna buy anything,

194
00:08:30,153 --> 00:08:32,063
then get your
yacht-rock-listening corny asses

195
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:33,687
back to Starbucks.

196
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:35,664
Oh, come on,
you got to help my friend.

197
00:08:35,664 --> 00:08:37,474
He needs a new look by tonight.

198
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:41,707
Huh. What's a square like you
doing with an oval like that?

199
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,920
(sighs) I get it,
the buckle's not cool.

200
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,656
Every time I wear it
I get razzed.

201
00:08:47,655 --> 00:08:49,455
Savagely razzed.

202
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,628
Tell you what,
you trade me that buckle,

203
00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:54,898
I'll take all this wrong
and make it right.

204
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,140
CARL:
Naima's worth it.

205
00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:03,352
Now, can you make me look real?
You know, authentic.

206
00:09:03,352 --> 00:09:05,662
Yeah, I got the perfect outfit.

Naima,
this place is amazing!

214
00:09:21,823 --> 00:09:25,773
- When did you open?
- Um, 75 years ago.

215
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,995
My great-grandparents started
out selling gumbo off of a cart.

216
00:09:29,004 --> 00:09:31,284
They gave free samples out
to the kids,

217
00:09:31,275 --> 00:09:34,005
you know, just poured it
right into their cupped hands.

218
00:09:34,014 --> 00:09:37,894
That cart, it became
my favorite table in the house.

219
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:39,289
Wow, that's a lot of history,

220
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:42,971
and, uh, ancestors, and, uh...

221
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:44,195
flavor.

222
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:45,971
So, tell me about you.

223
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:48,481
You know, like, what
are you into besides bowling?

224
00:09:48,476 --> 00:09:50,446
<i>CARL:
Don't talk about Moe's.
Don't talk about Moe's.</i>

225
00:09:50,447 --> 00:09:52,477
- Lenny!
- Who's Lenny?

226
00:09:52,484 --> 00:09:53,154
Ah, just my friend from Moe's.

227
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:55,722
Oh, that's cool.

228
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:57,964
I see you're into
the Black Panthers.

229
00:09:57,962 --> 00:09:59,732
Oh, yeah. Totally.
Wakanda Forever.

230
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:04,542
No, Huey P. Newton,
the guy that's on your shirt.

231
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:06,252
Oh, right. Him.

232
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:08,745
My man, Old Huey P.

233
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,060
1942 to 1989.
Early life and education...

234
00:10:12,057 --> 00:10:14,997
(chuckles) Are you googling him
under the table?

235
00:10:14,996 --> 00:10:18,866
No, I was, uh,
just looking at this dope kale.

236
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:20,571
Those are collard greens.

237
00:10:20,574 --> 00:10:23,614
Right.
I love all the urban veggies.

238
00:10:23,614 --> 00:10:24,524
Urban veggies?

239
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:27,616
Okay. You embarrassing
yourself right now.

240
00:10:27,622 --> 00:10:29,632
Look, I'm sorry.

241
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:30,086
I'm new to all this.

242
00:10:30,093 --> 00:10:32,503
New to being Black?

243
00:10:32,497 --> 00:10:34,197
Yes! I mean, no.

244
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:37,341
I mean, I'm just trying
to be more convincing at it.

245
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,850
I got the Denzel, I'm wearing
second-hand leather underwear,

246
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,918
and I'm doused
in Michael Jordan cologne

247
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:45,519
and Michael B. Jordan aftershave.

248
00:10:45,524 --> 00:10:48,834
Ooh, wow. Okay, there's
a lot to unpack there.

249
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:52,141
Look, I liked the guy
that I met at the bowling alley,

250
00:10:52,137 --> 00:10:54,677
and I wanted to get
to know him better,

251
00:10:54,676 --> 00:10:57,206
but I don't see
how that's gonna happen

252
00:10:57,214 --> 00:10:59,624
'cause you don't know you.

253
00:11:00,386 --> 00:11:04,086
So take my advice...
it's time to figure that out.

254
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:08,144
I'll have them wrap up
your oxtails to go.

255
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,905
I was eating what?

256
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:12,978
(country music playing)

257
00:11:26,338 --> 00:11:27,468
(sighs)

258
00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:29,609
Back early, eh?
You know what they say,

259
00:11:29,612 --> 00:11:33,792
"The shorter the date,
the more it went great."

260
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:35,987
No! It was terrible.

261
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:39,131
All she wanted to know about
was the real me.

262
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:42,001
You mean self-reflection?
Who does that?

263
00:11:42,003 --> 00:11:43,973
Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa,
trust the sign.

264
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:45,214
Mm-hmm.

265
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,050
I think I know
what she was getting at, but...

266
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:48,777
See, it's got to do with...

267
00:11:48,784 --> 00:11:49,754
Nah, never mind.

268
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:51,662
You guys wouldn't understand.

269
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:53,186
Sure we would.
We're your best friends.

270
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:56,302
We pee in the same trough together.

271
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,138
We've melted so much ice.

272
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:01,575
Just say what you need to say,
eh? We got this.

273
00:12:01,576 --> 00:12:03,476
I'm confused about
my racial identity!

274
00:12:04,983 --> 00:12:07,253
(overlapping nervous mumbling)

275
00:12:07,254 --> 00:12:09,024
(slurping nervously)

276
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:13,132
Hey, I know avoidance slurps
when I hear 'em.

277
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,102
(slurping)

278
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:17,243
No, we're perfectly comfortable
talking about...

279
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,480
(whispers):
race.

280
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:19,376
I mean, I can talk about

281
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:21,048
(whispers):
race...

282
00:12:21,048 --> 00:12:21,848
(normal volume):
...all day.

283
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,220
Oh, me, personally,

284
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:24,419
I don't even see...
(whispers): color.

285
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:28,001
Look, being adopted and raised
by white folks from Iceland,

286
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:29,695
I've always felt
like an outsider...

287
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:31,539
not Icelandic enough,
not Black enough.

288
00:12:31,536 --> 00:12:34,536
I mean, hey, sure,
I'm barfly enough,

289
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:36,052
but that's not enough.

290
00:12:36,045 --> 00:12:39,745
Hey, barflies have
a rich and storied... (belches)

291
00:12:39,752 --> 00:12:41,222
I don't know anything
about my roots!

292
00:12:41,221 --> 00:12:45,201
That stupid old rodeo
belt buckle was the only thing

293
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:47,466
I ever got
from my birth parents.

294
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,297
- (sighs)
- The buckle?

295
00:12:49,304 --> 00:12:50,944
But you gave that away.

296
00:12:50,941 --> 00:12:53,011
I know!
It-it was a panic swap!

297
00:12:53,012 --> 00:12:56,452
I thought I could get rid of
this sucky feeling of emptiness,

298
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:58,292
but now it's worse than ever.

299
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:00,929
If I'm ever going to be
with someone as great as Naima,

300
00:13:00,928 --> 00:13:03,228
then I need to find out
who I am.

301
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:03,902
And for the first time
in my life,

302
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,310
the answer isn't in this bar.

303
00:13:09,979 --> 00:13:12,749
(slurping nervously)

304
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:13,922
<i>(slurping continues)</i>

305
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,390
<i>- (Barney belches)
- (slurping continues)</i>

306
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:23,074
Carl's never been away
from Moe's this long.

307
00:13:23,072 --> 00:13:24,442
He missed
Public Domain Karaoke Night.

308
00:13:24,441 --> 00:13:27,521
How could I sing
"Toot, Toot, Tootsie, Goodbye!"

309
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,875
without my duet partner?

310
00:13:28,884 --> 00:13:33,294
Well, Carl did open up to you
about some big issues.

311
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:34,532
Just his identity.

312
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:36,829
My book club book says
it's important to look at

313
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,743
the discomfort you felt
as an opportunity

314
00:13:38,737 --> 00:13:43,207
to "explore your unacknowledged
privilege."

315
00:13:43,212 --> 00:13:44,152
Oh, buzz words.

316
00:13:44,147 --> 00:13:46,517
Have you even called him?

317
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,919
What am I supposed to say?

318
00:13:47,922 --> 00:13:50,792
Let's start with
what you're not supposed to say.

319
00:13:50,794 --> 00:13:52,774
-"My feelings matter, too."
- Said that.

320
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:53,695
-"Slavery was a long time ago."
- Thought that.

321
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:57,044
-"But I love Eddie Murphy."
- Lenny tweeted that.

322
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,910
I just want things
to be normal again.

323
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,150
Oh, that's on the list.

324
00:14:01,148 --> 00:14:02,918
Doesn't the book have
any suggestions

325
00:14:02,918 --> 00:14:04,318
for what I should do?

326
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:06,491
Hmm. Not to gesture,
not to quote,

327
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:09,932
not to laugh too hard at,
not to think, not to wear,

328
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,572
not to wear on Halloween,
not to sing along to in the car.

329
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:17,079
Look, Homer. I know you.

330
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,220
You're never going to say
the right thing,

331
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:22,257
but that doesn't mean
you should stop trying.

332
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,050
Lenny, are you sure you're okay

333
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:35,717
with selling
your vintage suspenders

334
00:14:35,718 --> 00:14:37,388
to buy back Carl's buckle?

335
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:38,387
Well, the doctor says
I should take a break

336
00:14:38,523 --> 00:14:41,863
because of the shoulder grooves
and nipple abrasions.

337
00:14:41,863 --> 00:14:44,173
You guys had
the same idea as me.

338
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:47,607
You're the best friends a guy
with no sense of self can have!

339
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:49,678
We're gonna get
that buckle back.

340
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,049
I already sold that buckle.

341
00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:52,418
Aw. Who bought it?

342
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:54,917
I don't know.
Some white guy who talks funny.

343
00:14:54,922 --> 00:14:58,602
Oh, that could be any of
the weirdos in this town.

344
00:14:58,597 --> 00:14:59,967
- Crinkle me kilt!
- Avast!

345
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,996
Zounds, Horatio.

346
00:15:02,003 --> 00:15:04,743
Damn,
this place gentrified fast.

347
00:15:04,742 --> 00:15:06,152
Look, I don't know
who bought your buckle.

348
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:07,405
All I know is
I call him the Rich Texan

349
00:15:07,414 --> 00:15:10,594
on account of him being
a rich Texan.

350
00:15:10,587 --> 00:15:13,727
I love buckles. Yeehaw!

351
00:15:13,727 --> 00:15:16,467
- (bullet ricocheting)
- (exclaiming)

352
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:20,065
While that's doing its thing,
let's talk.

353
00:15:20,072 --> 00:15:22,482
My buckle shows
a cowboy wrestling a bull

354
00:15:22,477 --> 00:15:24,677
and kind of... kissing it?

355
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:27,122
Oh, that one?
Ain't no smooch.

356
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,630
He's biting its lip. Bulldogging.

357
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,355
I already flipped it.

358
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:32,301
Aw! You sold it?

359
00:15:32,297 --> 00:15:36,607
To a pal of mine
who's a real buckle-head.

360
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:38,536
He said it had
a heapin' helpin'

361
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:40,553
of historical heritage.

362
00:15:40,547 --> 00:15:43,187
Do you think the guy who bought
it could help me find my roots?

363
00:15:43,185 --> 00:15:46,155
Hmm. Well, it's a long shot.

364
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:50,968
Fellas, meet the host of
<i>Finding Your Roots,</i>

365
00:15:50,968 --> 00:15:53,538
Dr. Henry Louis Gates, Jr.

366
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,410
Dr. Gates,
you're a national treasure.

367
00:15:56,411 --> 00:15:58,981
Please, at best
I'm a regional treasure.

368
00:15:58,984 --> 00:16:02,024
That buckle is a stunning piece
of American history.

369
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:04,463
What's your connection to it?

370
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:06,001
Well, all I know is that
after my parents died,

371
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,368
it was in my bassinet
when I was dropped off

372
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:09,199
at the orphanage.

373
00:16:09,404 --> 00:16:12,184
Other than that,
my heritage is a blank slate.

374
00:16:12,177 --> 00:16:15,047
Solving this kind of
life-defining, soul-affirming

375
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:17,859
historical riddle is the reason
I created this show.

376
00:16:17,855 --> 00:16:20,255
Tell my next guest
he's bumped.

377
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:23,469
Ah, it's probably for the best.

378
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:24,995
<i>ANNOUNCER:
Finding Your Roots.</i>

379
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:26,772
<i>With Dr. Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</i>

380
00:16:26,773 --> 00:16:29,983
Carl, when you look at
this buckle, what do you feel?

381
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:32,479
I just want to know...
what gives?

382
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:34,893
Today, you'll hear
the story that answers

383
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:38,199
that very question:
"what gives?"

384
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,842
What got you started
on this journey of discovery?

385
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:44,938
An amazing woman I met.

386
00:16:44,942 --> 00:16:47,412
Hey, the most awkward guy
I ever dated is on TV.

387
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:50,553
Ooh, come on,
mention the restaurant.

388
00:16:50,554 --> 00:16:52,424
<i>I felt like such a fool</i>

389
00:16:52,423 --> 00:16:55,163
<i>as I left with my takeout bag
from SoulHouse.</i>

390
00:16:55,162 --> 00:16:57,802
- (cheers)
- He said it! Ooh, he said it.

391
00:16:57,801 --> 00:16:59,341
Let me introduce you to Ellis.

392
00:16:59,337 --> 00:17:01,977
Ellis! I bet I'm related to him.

393
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:03,806
I wasn't supposed
to say that yet, was I?

394
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:05,653
Just act surprised later.

395
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:06,921
Turn the page.

396
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,730
From this pre-Civil War
document, we know that

397
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:12,625
<i>your fourth great-grandfather
was born into slavery</i>

398
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,701
<i>on a ranch in Texas.</i>

399
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:18,642
<i>On what would become
the first Juneteenth in 1865,</i>

400
00:17:18,643 --> 00:17:21,083
<i>Ellis got word that
the Emancipation Proclamation</i>

401
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,151
<i>had freed the slaves</i>

402
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,820
<i>two years earlier.</i>

403
00:17:24,822 --> 00:17:26,562
<i>Angry and determined,</i>

404
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,399
<i>he leapt onto the wildest
stallion on the ranch</i>

405
00:17:28,395 --> 00:17:29,565
<i>and held on for dear life.</i>

406
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:32,835
<i>Three days later,
and two states over,</i>

407
00:17:32,838 --> 00:17:34,408
<i>that stallion was broken.</i>

408
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:36,807
<i>But Ellis,
who'd been born a slave,</i>

409
00:17:36,813 --> 00:17:38,283
<i>was not only free,</i>

410
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:40,992
<i>now he was a cowboy.</i>

411
00:17:40,988 --> 00:17:42,788
Really?
I come from cowboys?

412
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:47,431
<i>DR. GATES:
My friend, you come
from a long line of cowboys,</i>

413
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:50,113
<i>right up to Wyatt, your father.</i>

414
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:52,006
<i>CARL:
That's my dad.</i>

415
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,980
And here he is
at the Okmulgee Oklahoma Rodeo.

416
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:58,194
- (bull grunting)
- (spectators cheering)

417
00:17:59,124 --> 00:18:02,434
<i>20 seconds!
Unbelievable ride!</i>

418
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,600
<i>What are you gonna do
with your grand prize buckle?</i>

419
00:18:04,602 --> 00:18:08,512
<i>Use it to hold up my Wranglers.
(chuckles)</i>

420
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,450
<i>But then I'm going
to pass it on to my kin.</i>

421
00:18:11,448 --> 00:18:14,318
<i>Folks don't always see us
as cowboys,</i>

422
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:17,701
<i>but when my boy wears
this blue-ribbon belly-badge,</i>

423
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:21,365
<i>he'll know bull riding's
in his blood.</i>

424
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:24,338
I finally know who I am.

425
00:18:29,952 --> 00:18:32,092
I'm a Black cowboy.

426
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,030
Uh, that's great, Carl,

427
00:18:33,258 --> 00:18:36,628
but does that mean you're
qualified to be doing this?

428
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:38,473
(bull snorts)

429
00:18:38,469 --> 00:18:41,069
Yeah, what the hell
are you doing?

430
00:18:41,074 --> 00:18:42,514
What I was born to do.

431
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:45,051
Get killed by
a 2,000-pound super cow?

432
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:47,989
Guys, don't worry,
I got the buckle.

433
00:18:47,988 --> 00:18:49,388
Uh...

434
00:18:49,391 --> 00:18:51,861
Doctor,
can't you do something?

435
00:18:51,863 --> 00:18:53,533
Sorry, I see this a lot.

436
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,443
Once, I had to pull Laurence
Fishburne out of a jet cockpit

437
00:18:56,438 --> 00:18:59,208
after he found out
his great-uncle was

438
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,080
a Tuskegee Airman.

439
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:03,091
Naima, you came!

440
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:05,715
Yeah,
I got your suicidal Evite.

441
00:19:05,724 --> 00:19:07,164
(bull snorting)

442
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,030
Carl, don't do this.

443
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,030
You don't need
to prove anything to me.

444
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:13,774
No, I need to prove it
to myself.

445
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:16,013
Bull riding is in my blood.

446
00:19:16,011 --> 00:19:17,681
(groans) That is not
how blood works!

447
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:20,991

Don't worry, I'll fix that.

464

One in four cowboys who settled
the Old West was Black.

465
00:20:04,675 --> 00:20:06,975
(chuckles) Oh,
and you know the Lone Ranger?

466
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:09,689
No, I'm a young person.

467
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:13,085
Well, he was based on
a real guy, Lawman Bass Reeves.

468
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:16,532
Maybe it's that you took my
advice and explored your past,

469
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:19,512
or maybe I just like a man
who does what I tell him,

470
00:20:19,505 --> 00:20:22,875

right now.

Oh, and thanks for
the O-positive, by the way.

473
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:29,934
So, does this make me
a cowboy, too?
