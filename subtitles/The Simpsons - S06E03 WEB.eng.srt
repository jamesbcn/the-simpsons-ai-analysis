1
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:06,131
The Simpsons.

2
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:40,248
This romance is so full
of heartfelt passion.

3
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:44,335
I can really identify
with this corn-fed heroine.

4
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,630
Homer, are you awake?
This is important.

5
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,914
Give me some sign
you're awake.

6
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,842
Wake up!

7
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,635
Huh? What's wrong?

8
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,138
House run away?
Dog's on fire?

9
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,890
Homie, do you think that
the romance

10
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,391
has gone out of our lives?

11
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,394
Wake up!

12
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,272
Marge, it's 3:00 a.m.,
and I worked all day.

13
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,025
It's 9:30 p.m., and you spent
your whole Saturday

14
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,360
drinking beer
in Maggie's kiddie pool.

15
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,530
Hmm? There you are.

16
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,199
Thought you could get away, huh?

17
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:17,202
Homer, young people
learn about love from adults,

18
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,953
and we've been setting
a terrible example

19
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,872
for our children and
the community in general.

20
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,791
I want us to
deal with the issues

21
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,542
raised by this book.

22
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:30,632
I knew we shouldn't have put
a fireplace in the bedroom.

23
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,084
How many times
can you laugh at that cat

24
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,710
getting hit
by the moon?

25
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,337
It's a new episode.

26
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,881
Not exactly. They pieced
it together from old shows

27
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,758
and it seems new
to the trusting eyes

28
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,135
of impressionable youth.

29
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,469
Really?

30
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,429
Ren and Stimpy
do it all the time.

31
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,449
Yes, they do, and when was
the last time you heard anyone

32
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,725
talk about Ren and Stimpy?

33
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,146
Children, your father and I
have fed you and clothed you,

34
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,731
but we've neglected
something more important.

35
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,109
It's time to learn
about love.

36
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,111
No need, Mom. We already
learned in school.

37
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,280
This is Fuzzy Bunny.

38
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,948
About a year ago,

39
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,992
he noticed his voice
was changing.

40
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,785
He had terrible acne

41
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,038
and had fur where
there was no fur before.

42
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,541
He also noticed
Fluffy Bunny.

43
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,543
Bor-ring.

44
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,086
Fuzzy went to the park,

45
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,714
the ice cream social,
the boat show,

46
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,133
and various other
wholesome activities.

47
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,135
And they never
ruined their fun

48
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,430
by giving in to their
throbbing biological urges.

49
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,932
Then came the big day.

50
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,851
Fluffy and Fuzzy
got married.

51
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:08,104
That night came
the honeymoon.

52
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,316
She's faking it.

53
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,736
I mean romance,
not love.

54
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,112
Mom, romance is dead.

55
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,531
It was acquired
in a hostile takeover

56
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,949
by Hallmark and Disney,

57
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,327
homogenized and sold off
piece by piece.

58
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,661
That's not true.

59
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,538
Romance is all around us...

60
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,332
In our neighborhoods...

61
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,500
even at our jobs.

62
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,512
All you have to do

63
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,515
is think about
your most cherished memories.

64
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,624
- Moe's Tavern.
- Hello, is Al there?

65
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,354
Al?

66
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,980
Yeah, Al.
Last name Coholic.

67
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,941
Let me check.

68
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,360
Phone call for Al.
Al Coholic.

69
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,612
A Jock Strap?

70
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,656
Is I.P. Freely here?

71
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,574
Hey, is there a Butts here?

72
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,451
Seymour Butts?

73
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,828
Ah, Homer Sexual?

74
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,623
Mike Crotch?
Uh, Amanda Hugginkiss?

75
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,084
Ah, Hugh Jass?
Ivana Tinkle?

76
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,711
I'm a stupid moron
with an ugly face

77
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,339
and a big butt,
and my butt smells,

78
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,549
and I like to kiss
my own butt.

79
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,426
No! No! No!

80
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,514
No, ask your heart
what its fondest desire is.

81
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,352
Chocolate.

82
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,355
Invisible cola.

83
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,483
Forbidden doughnut.

84
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,611
Sacrilicious.

85
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,281
Mmm. Snouts.

86
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,283
Mmm. Free goo.

87
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,952
Mmm. Something.

88
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,538
No. Think about people...

89
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,250
About moments in your life
that have been very romantic.

90
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,960
Oh, okay.

91
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,841
That's not the idea at all.

92
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,762
Okay. Well,
this story isn't ideal.

93
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,181
I've never told it
to you before.

94
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,934
I got a very thoughtless
birthday present

95
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,854
from someone
who shall remain nameless.

96
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,984
So I actually went
to the bowling alley

97
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,152
to spite him... or her.

98
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,164
I'm awfully sorry.

99
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,583
Entirely my fault.

100
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,418
It is nice
to meet you...

101
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,088
- Homer.
- Oh. No, no.

102
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,090
Homer is my...
ball's name.

103
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,092
I'm Marge.

104
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,433
Your fingers are so slender,
so feminine.

105
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,561
They're far too tapered
for the ball you're using.

106
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,606
You need something lighter,
more delicate.

107
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,982
Here, use my ball.

108
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,776
No. No, thank you,

109
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,694
mister, um... Brunswick.

110
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,112
Call me Jacques.

111
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,196
Jacques.

112
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,740
Marge.

113
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,951
May I ask you
a bold question?

114
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,035
Sure.

115
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,412
You've never
bowled before?

116
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,496
- Never.
- No.

117
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,916
- No.
- Then I will teach you.

118
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,376
Oh, I don't want
to trouble you.

119
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,294
Not at all.
I am a professional.

120
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,255
Roll the ball for me, Marge.
Let me see your form.

121
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,092
All right,
but I'm not very good.

122
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,638
I can hit that
one pin all right,

123
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,932
but the rest of them
don't even wobble.

124
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,683
I can help you, Marge.
Pick up the ball.

125
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,936
Pick up Homer.
Pick him up.

126
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,482
- Now, throw.
- But...

127
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,025
Throw, damn you.

128
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:48,157
You're a very
good teacher.

129
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,284
Here we are.

130
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,245
You didn't have to
drop me off.

131
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,663
But I wanted to.

132
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,499
Marge, do you know
how beautiful you look

133
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,126
in the moonlight?

134
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,461
Oh, Jacques,
I'm a married woman.

135
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,088
I know, I know.

136
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,424
My mind says stop,
but my heart

137
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,676
and my hips
cry, "proceed!"

138
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,471
Marge, darling, I want
to see you tomorrow.

139
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,014
Meet me tomorrow
for brunch.

140
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,016
- What's brunch?
- You'd love it.

141
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,269
It's not quite breakfast.
It's not quite lunch.

142
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,896
But it comes with a slice
of cantaloupe at the end.

143
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,774
You don't get completely
what you would at breakfast,

144
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,401
but you get
a good meal.

145
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,736
He seemed to know
a lot about brunch.

146
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,406
But it turned out he wasn't
interested in brunch at all.

147
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,868
Your laughter
is like music to me.

148
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,370
But if you laugh at what I
say next, I will die.

149
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,206
For I am about to say
something very serious,

150
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,374
perhaps shocking.

151
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,709
Marge, my darling,

152
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,295
I want you
to meet with me again.

153
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,880
That doesn't shock me.

154
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,258
Away from prying eyes
at my apartment,

155
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,093
the Fiesta Terrace.

156
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,764
Marge, speak to me.

157
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,225
Is Thursday okay?

158
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,490
Thank goodness

159
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,909
I drove down that
ironic street.

160
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,287
I made the right decision
to stay with my Homie

161
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,414
and there was no harm done.

162
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,460
So if you kind of
mentally snip out the part

163
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,128
where I already had a husband,

164
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,922
that's my idea of romance.

165
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,466
Marge, I want you
to stop seeing this Jacques.

166
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,885
You can let him down gently.

167
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,112
But over the next
couple of months,

168
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,888
I want you to break it off.

169
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,390
Uh, okay, Homer.

170
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,226
That was
a close one, kids.

171
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,647
Okay, Marge,

172
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,982
as long as we're
traumatizing the kids,

173
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,319
I have a scandalous story
of my own.

174
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,154
Gentlemen,

175
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,990
I'd like you to meet your
new co-worker, Mindy Simmons.

176
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,326
I think she has a degree
in engineering or something.

177
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,994
Hi. How's it going?

178
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,080
- Pleased to meet you.
- Yeah. Ditto.

179
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,164
Hi. Huh?

180
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,462
Homer, what's
the matter?

181
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,130
Ain't you never seen
a naked chick

182
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,298
riding a clam before?

183
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,926
Got to go!

184
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,892
I made it the whole day
without seeing her again.

185
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,980
I mean, hello!

186
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,316
I guess we'll be
going down together...

187
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,544
I mean, getting off togeth...
I mean...

188
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,111
That's okay.

189
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,713
I'll just push the button
for the stimulator...

190
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,823
I mean elevator.

191
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,492
Think unsexy thoughts,
think unsexy thoughts...

192
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,628
Well, this
is my floor.

193
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,424
See you tomorrow.

194
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,551
I tried to avoid her,

195
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,012
but we were sent to
a nuclear convention

196
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,805
in Capital City together.

197
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,477
TV's there,
bathroom's there,

198
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,896
and there's your
king-sized bed for...

199
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,071
Hubba, hubba.

200
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,698
Stop that. I love my wife
and family.

201
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,908
All I'm gonna use this bed
for is sleeping, eating,

202
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:18,909
and maybe building
a little fort.

203
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,661
That's it.

204
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,954
Homer.

205
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,831
I got a really wicked idea

206
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,916
that could get us
into a lot of trouble.

207
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,836
Mindy. We have to fight
our temptation.

208
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,963
No, Homer.

209
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,590
Let's do it.

210
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,635
Let's call room service!

211
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,597
Someone is charging room service
to the company, sir.

212
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,516
Well, we'll just see about that.

213
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,436
Fly, my pretties.

214
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,771
Fly!

215
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,779
Continue the research.

216
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,159
Thanks for poisoning
the planet, bastard!

217
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,369
Get bent.

218
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,620
No more Chernobyls!

219
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,997
- Go to hell!
- Ah!

220
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,042
I was doing my best
to resist her,

221
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,796
but at dinner, the fortune
cookie predicted doom.

222
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,470
This was a really nice
night, Homer.

223
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,180
Yeah, yeah.

224
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,475
What's wrong?

225
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:27,269
Oh, yeah.
Like you don't know.

226
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,063
We're gonna have sex.

227
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,651
Well... we don't have to.

228
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,735
Yes, we do.

229
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,987
The cookie told me so.

230
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,241
Well, desserts
aren't always right.

231
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,951
But they're so sweet.

232
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,203
Homer...

233
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:47,164
you know how I feel,

234
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,625
so... it... it's up to you.

235
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,918
Look in your heart.

236
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,671
I think you'll see
what you want.

237
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,355
Oh, baby.

238
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:16,402
This was
a wonderful idea, Homie.

239
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,570
What happened to Mindy?

240
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,488
Yes, what did happen to her?

241
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,907
She hit the bottle pretty hard
and lost her job.

242
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,701
Hmm. Good.

243
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,870
Does anyone else
have a love story?

244
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,080
Yes, I do. And just like
your love stories,

245
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,125
it's tragic and filled with
hurt feelings and scars

246
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,085
that will never heal.

247
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,504
It started,
appropriately enough,

248
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,340
with an innocent boy being
embarrassed on Valentine's Day.

249
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,181
Poor Ralph.

250
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,767
Here you go, Ralph.

251
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,772
You choo-choo-choose me?

252
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,231
Happy Valentine's.

253
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,446
It was an unusually warm.

254
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,698
February 14,
so the children walked home

255
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,949
without jackets.

256
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,745
Can I walk you home...
valentine?

257
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,538
Sure, I guess.

258
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,666
That valentine
sure was funny.

259
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,668
Glad you liked it.

260
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:18,005
It says,
"choo-choo-choose me"

261
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,175
and there's a picture
of a train.

262
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,927
Yeah, nice gag.

263
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,931
Uh... so...

264
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:31,143
do you like... stuff?

265
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,982
The doctor said I wouldn't
have so many nosebleeds

266
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,693
if I kept my finger
out of there.

267
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,737
Well, here's my house.

268
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,039
Oh, no.
It's a package from Ralph.

269
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:57,002
Oh, a Malibu Stacy
convertible.

270
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,129
"Look in the tunk."

271
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,840
He must mean trunk.

272
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,679
Tickets to
the Krusty anniversary show!

273
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:10,891
It's the Krusty The Clown
29th Anniversary Show!

274
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,102
Hey!

275
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,896
Thank you! Thank you!

276
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,774
Lisa, do you want
a bite of my ice cream?

277
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:19,942
No, thanks.

278
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,402
Send it this way, boy.

279
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,821
- Whoops.
- Aww...

280
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,365
Oh... nothing
gets chocolate out.

281
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,700
See?

282
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,411
Now for my favorite part
of the show.

283
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,288
What's that say?

284
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,497
"Talk to the audience"?

285
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,083
Oh, God, this is always death.

286
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,543
All right.

287
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,837
Oh, no. Please don't
show me with Ralph.

288
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,090
- What's your name, son?
- Ralph.

289
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,260
And is this
your girlfriend, Ralph?

290
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:49,179
Yes. I love Lisa Simpson,

291
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,307
and when I grow up,
I'm going to marry her.

292
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,641
No!

293
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,060
Now you listen to me!

294
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,688
I don't like you!
I never liked you!

295
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,624
And the only reason I gave you
that stupid Valentine

296
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,858
was 'cause
nobody else would!

297
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,902
Watch this, Lis.

298
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,403
You can actually pinpoint
the second

299
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,238
when his heart
rips in half.

300
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:10,910
And... now.

301
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,708
Lisa, not all romances
turn out that way.

302
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,460
Bart, do you have
a love story

303
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,420
that doesn't end
in heartbreak?

304
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,255
Yes, I do.

305
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,049
The only girl I ever loved

306
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,301
invited me up to
the tree house.

307
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,346
She had something
very important to tell me.

308
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,098
I'm so happy.

309
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,934
I just had
to tell someone.

310
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,644
I have a boyfriend.

311
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,441
You won't be
needing this.

312
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,161
Wait. That did end
in heartbreak.

313
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:57,081
Thanks for opening up
old wounds, Mom.

314
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,885
Well, as Jerry Lee Lewis
would say,

315
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,680
"There's a whole lot
of frowning going on."

316
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,687
Mom, doesn't any love story
have a happy ending?

317
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,480
Of course.

318
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,482
Remember when...

319
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,777
your aunt Selma got married?

320
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,530
Oh, oh, good.

321
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,115
Soon I will kill you.

322
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,117
Wait, wait. That's no good.

323
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,868
I know. Your grandfather.

324
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,412
Remember?

325
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,914
It all started
on an outing for dinner.

326
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,168
Say, I've got a neat idea.

327
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,337
Why don't you go in
and pick up my mother

328
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,755
and we'll all go out
to dinner?

329
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,549
I'll be back in a jiffy.

330
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,763
That's not my mother.

331
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,181
I'll be back
in a jiffy.

332
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,227
Can I come too?

333
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,857
They hit it off
right away,

334
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,233
but there
were rivals

335
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,652
for the fair
lady's hand.

336
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,322
My favorite song.

337
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,408
This is so nice.

338
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,911
I can't remember
when I felt this young.

339
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,748
I really can't.

340
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,337
Say, sport,
mind if I have the next dance?

341
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,922
What the...

342
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,341
Don't sneak up on a...
Oh, you...

343
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,594
No need for the blown gasket,
Charlie.

344
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,846
I'll have her back
in one piece.

345
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,985
But, in the end,

346
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,945
just when things
looked worst,

347
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,574
true love triumphed.

348
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:59,161
Do you, Jacqueline Bouvier,
take this man

349
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,413
to be your lawfully
wedded husband?

350
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,584
Oh, Monty,
my favorite song.

351
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,962
I specifically requested
no romantic music.

352
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,716
Mrs. Bouvier!

353
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,926
Mrs. Bouvier!

354
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,014
Mrs. Bouvier!

355
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,684
Honey, are you sure you want
to be Mrs. Montgomery Burns?

356
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,814
Wouldn't you rather be
Mrs. Abraham J. Simpson?

357
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,357
No.

358
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,735
I don't want to be either.

359
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,529
Hot diggety damn!

360
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,490
That's good enough for me.

361
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,631
That doesn't seem
like a happy ending.

362
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,801
That seems more like a detached
tale of modern alienation.

363
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,636
I give up.

364
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,305
Did anybody learn anything
about love tonight?

365
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,516
I learned it screws
everybody up.

366
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,518
There's that side of it,

367
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,228
but there's also...

368
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,480
Help me out here, Lisa.

369
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,733
Sorry, Mom. I've decided to
save my love for someone

370
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,194
who's guaranteed
not to reject me.

371
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,864
Soon, Corey, soon.

372
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:23,245
Well, kids, I tried.
But maybe you're right.

373
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,373
Wait a minute, Marge.
Love isn't hopeless.

374
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,209
Look, maybe I'm no
expert on the subject,

375
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,504
but there was one time
I got it right.

376
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,589
Gee, Artie...

377
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,132
Artie, wait. I don't know.

378
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,009
I mean,
it was a beautiful evening.

379
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,219
- Let's not ruin it.
- Just this...

380
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,554
Artie, please.

381
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,889
Come on, kiss me.

382
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,182
- Oh, Artie...
- Please?

383
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,143
No, really, I mean it!
Now stop it!

384
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,353
I'm sorry, Marge.

385
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,771
Take me home, Artie.

386
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,367
Marge, I would
appreciate it

387
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,704
if you didn't tell anybody
about my busy hands.

388
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,749
Not so much for myself,
but I am so respected

389
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:12,085
it would damage
the town to hear it.

390
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,169
Good night.

391
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,838
Yeah, right.

392
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,844
Shut up!

393
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,430
I'm over as far as I can go.

394
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,266
All right! All right!

395
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,227
I'll walk in the mud!

396
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,730
- Homer?
- Marge?

397
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,399
- Yeah. You want a ride?
- Sure.

398
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,445
You know, Homer,
when I got home,

399
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,948
I realized who I should have
gone to the prom with.

400
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,116
Who? Oh.

401
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,451
Hi, prom date.

402
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,746
Marge, pour vous.

403
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,541
Why so glum?

404
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,710
I got a problem.

405
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,713
Once you stop this car,

406
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,216
I'm gonna hug you
and kiss you,

407
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,885
and then I'll never
be able to let you go.

408
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,638
Ah, your first kiss.

409
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,515
But not the last.

410
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:23,365
Mmm... Homie.

411
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,409
- Mmm...
- Mmm...

412
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,204
See, kids?

413
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,665
That's what I meant
by romance.
