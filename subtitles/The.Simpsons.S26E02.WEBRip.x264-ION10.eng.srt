00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,989
-We're on an old-time boat.
-We've been kidnapped.

176
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,704
(chuckles)
Not kidnapped, shanghaied.

177
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,195
BOTH: Oh.

178
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,117
My name is Captain Bowditch.

179
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,576
Your wife signed you up
for a week at sea,

180
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,286
where you'll live like sailors,
eat like sailors,

181
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:27,377
and use therapeutic techniques
to solve father-son conflicts...

182
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,665
like sailors.

183
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,590
BOTH: Hmm?

184
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:35,967
For there's no better place
to solve relationship issues than on...

185
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,677

186

189

190
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,860
Hey, lame ass, thanks to you,
we're stuck on a stupid therapy boat.

191
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,236
I'm the lame ass?

192
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,742
The only lame ass on this boat
is you and all the other lame asses!

193
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,749
(both grunting, groaning)

194
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,538
Shouldn't we do something?

195
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,963
We are doing something.

196
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,631
We're empathizing.

197
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:10,045
I just know Bart and Homer
are best friends already.

198
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,052
-I can feel it.
-(computer dings)

199
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:15,354
Ooh, I'm getting a message from
your father's fantasy football league.

200
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,389
I must still be logged in as him.

201
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,143
(Marge gasps)

202
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,635
Lenny used the "uck" word.

203
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,597
Mom, it's trash talk.

204
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,318
You know how guys say
mean things to their friends,

205
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,489
the way women say nice things
to their enemies.

206
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,149
-Oh.
-(computer dings)

207
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,028
MARGE: Oh. Mm.

208
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,235

209
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,502
Yikes!

210
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,369
Well, I don't like this trash talk.

211
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,536
And I'm gonna do something about it.

212
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,335
Even if I have to bring in the big guns.

213
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,840
Dear Lord, please help
Homer's friends understand

214
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,093
that make-believe computer football

215
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:56,505

the Internet to be mean.

217
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,653

218
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,400
In church? No.

219
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,732
No, not here.

220
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,357

221
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,114
(gasps) It's everywhere.

222
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,196
And now, a moment of silence

223
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:20,042

of the Shelbyville sinkhole.

224
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,789

233
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,771

So, Cletus, Gitmo,

240
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,495
what brings you fellas to
<i>The Relation Ship?</i>

241
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,093
My daddy's always overpraisin' me.

242
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,049
Aw, that's great honesty, son.

243
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,959
I'm so proud of you.

244
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,508
(scoffs)
Why won't you let me fail?

245
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,432
What about you, Bart, Homer? Homer?

246
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,852
Lethargy, skin spots, spongy gums--

247
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,772
this man's got scurvy.

248
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,100
But we've only been at sea one day.

249
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,686
When's the last time you had citrus?

250
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,782
I had a mimosa at brunch a few years ago.

251
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,948
Well, Bart, while your father
spends the next few days

252
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,108
sucking out of the lemon barrel,

253
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,617
you'll drink deep of the hearty grog
of empowerment.

254
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,451
-What does that mean?
-Mainly climbing.

255
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:48,457
Except for Wednesday night
when we project a movie on the sails.

256
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,631
But, really, a lot of climbing.

257
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,630
(Gilbert and Sullivan's
"We Sail the Ocean Blue" playing)

258
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,785
Sheepshank, bowline, clove hitch...

259
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,661
(Homer sucking)

260
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,418
Dad, look, I did a round turn
with two half hitches.

261
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,250
You lie!

262
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,335
(gasps) Wait a minute.

263
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,011
Windswept hair, rugged tan,

264
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,669
rough, calloused hands.

265
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,638
-You're enjoying this, aren't you?!
-So what if I am?

266
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,799
You're my son,
and you will hate what I hate.

267
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,678
Angled parking. Lemons.

268
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,805
Kickstarters by famous guys
who already have lots of money.

269
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,233
And this boat!

270
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,561
I'm old enough to choose
my own things to hate.

271
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,056
And the things I like.

272
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,068
And I like being a sailor.

273
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,690
Betrayed by my worst enemy.

274
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,818
I never would have seen it coming.

275
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,235
Why, Bart,
that's a perfect halyard cleat.

276
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,035
Just like you taught me, Captain.

277
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,828
Over, under, over, under, over,
under, under, under, over, over,

278
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,673
over, over, over, over, over,
under, over, half hitch.

279
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,789
Well, the standard form
is under, over, under, over,

280
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,086
under, under, under, under, under,

281

over, over, under, under, under,

282

Fathers, sons,

283
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,344
together we've made
a lot of progress on this voyage.

284
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,347
I learned that left is called "port."

285
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,019
I finally got over my sea sickness.

286
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,518
(retches)

287
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,060
Terrific, Homer. Just terrific.

288
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,694
But one sailor has truly taken
to nautical life.

289
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:40,113
I hereby award Bart Simpson
the post of midshipman.

290
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,699
Wow. So now I can give orders?

291
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,032
That's right, Mr. Midshipman.

292
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:50,537
Wait a minute. I'm his father.
He can't order me around.

293
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,081
He's your superior officer,

294
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,794
so he can and will order you around.

295
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,455
And what if I refuse?

296
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,875
Oh!

297
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,973
I'm sorry we had to discipline you.

298
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,928
On the positive side,
you won't miss out

299
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,298
on the father-son hornpipe dance.

300
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,966

301
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,021
Oh, I hate the Golden Age of Sail.

303
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,152
Officer on deck!

304
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,702
Seaman Homer,
you're supposed to be swabbing the deck.

305
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,794
Why should I?
It's just gonna get dirty again.

306
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,870
I'm in charge.
You do what I say.

307
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,115
Fine. I'll swab whatever you say.

308
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,627
{\an8}Look! I'm swabbing the deck.

309
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,550
I'm swabbing this giant tree
that the sail grows out of.

310
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,050
Ooh! I'm swabbing the top of the ocean.

311
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,893
Ooh! Swab, swab, swab...

312
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,219
Hey! What the...

313
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,965
Fantasy football has turned
every man in this town

314
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,557
into a trash-talking monster.

315
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:58,113
Oh, face it--
all men live in a sad world

316
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:02,688

352
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:43,963
Ahoy, Midshipman.

353
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,424
I hope your voyage on <i>The Relation Ship</i>

354
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,005
is proving interpersonally fruitful.

355
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,221
I don't know.

356
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,260
It's really hard when someone
doesn't respect your authority.

357
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,255
Epiphany ho.

358
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,097
And I'm sure your father
has been doing some growing

359
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,773

You don't need booze, Homer.

365
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:17,582
I went to sea
because I'm a recovering alcoholic.

366
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,501
But out here on the waves,
I no longer crave

367
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:24,131
the sweet, warm, soothing flavors

368
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,629

00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,298
I love this boat!

371
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:36,104
With all its pullies and flappies and...

372
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,140
Everything has a name.

373
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,643
You know what, Homer?

374
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,805
I've always wanted to eat a parrot.

375
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,814
What's the big deal?
It's just like a green chicken!

Okay, o-okay.

-Do somethin', boy!
-You criticized me!

394
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,171
That's all I ever wanted, Daddy,

395

-honest parenting.
-Aw...

396
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,219
Now I'm the ship's
highest-ranking officer.

397
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,431
It's up to me to get us to shore.

398
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,393
Dad, we can make it to harbor

399
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,885
if we can just sail
around that lighthouse.

400
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,898
Are you crazy? We'll never make it!

401
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,940
Drop the anchor and wait out the storm!

402
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,193
No, we need to sail.
