1
00:00:09,651 --> 00:00:10,908
Hmm.

2
00:00:10,986 --> 00:00:13,411
Who are these perfectly
coiffed young men

3
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:15,155
on all the billboards?

4
00:00:15,173 --> 00:00:17,248
Wolfgang Von Bassdrop?

5
00:00:17,326 --> 00:00:19,768
Pound Sign Von Pound Sign?

6
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:21,270
Sex Towel?

7
00:00:21,346 --> 00:00:23,105
Glenn the Eruptor?

8
00:00:23,651 --> 00:00:26,516
In my day, billboards advertised
things that made sense,

9
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:30,094
like energy drinks or exciting
new windshield repair companies.

10
00:00:30,172 --> 00:00:32,506
Now it's just an endless
stream of lookalike weirdos

11
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:34,190
who no one has ever heard of.

12
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,934
They're all DJs with residencies

13
00:00:37,012 --> 00:00:39,195
at casinos and nightclubs.

14
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,773
They can make millions
of dollars in one night.

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,711
I heard DJ Cheeseface bought
his parents a mansion.

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,871
That's right, Homer.

17
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,372
He bought us a mansion.

18
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:51,300
Son buy mansion?

19
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:53,969
Bart is son.

20
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:03,461
What the hell are you doing?

21
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,539
Duh, I'm giving you a glow-up

22
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,316
for your rewarding new career.

23
00:01:07,392 --> 00:01:08,966
Keeping you off the streets

24
00:01:09,044 --> 00:01:10,819
and me in a mansion.

25
00:01:10,896 --> 00:01:13,046
You're going to be the
world's next hot DJ.

26
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:15,882
You can start by mixing
with all my old records.

27
00:01:15,884 --> 00:01:18,643
Smash Mouth,
British nerd rocker Thomas Dolby.

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,996
Akron, Ohio nerd rockers Devo.

29
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,056
And Taco's<i> Puttin' On the Ritz.</i>

30
00:01:23,058 --> 00:01:26,168
Mmm, tacos, pudding and Ritz.

31
00:01:26,244 --> 00:01:28,170
From these musical seeds, you will grow

32
00:01:28,246 --> 00:01:31,064
a mighty skyscraper of
DJ fame and fortune.

33
00:01:31,066 --> 00:01:32,582
Now get behind those turntables

34
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,827
and start spinning that
big stack of black shellac.

35
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,502
Hey, this doesn't suck.

36
00:01:46,748 --> 00:01:48,506
I've always wanted to
do something creative

37
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:50,100
without actually creating something.

38
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,434
♪ <i>She blinded me with science...</i> ♪

39
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,753
Hmm, something's still off.

Rave against the dawn.

44
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:06,266
♪ <i>When a problem comes along,

45

46
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,941
What's all this ruckus?

47
00:02:14,943 --> 00:02:16,776
It's the middle of the night.

48
00:02:16,778 --> 00:02:19,295
If the boy's gonna
succeed in the DJ world,

49
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,631
he needs to practice on Ibiza time,

50
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,374
though at this point, I don't even think

51
00:02:23,452 --> 00:02:25,135
he's good enough for Corfu.

52
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,454
I don't know what any
of those words mean,

53
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,140
but Maggie needs her sleep.

54
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,216

From the mind of John Krasinski.

59
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,561
I hate that guy!

60
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,156
Bart cannot be a DJ in our basement.

61
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:49,251
Honey, I completely agree.

62
00:02:49,857 --> 00:02:51,479
_

63
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,571
Enjoy the billboard, pally.

64
00:02:53,649 --> 00:02:55,590
Seems like a good investment to me.

65
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:58,485
I don't have a single concern.

66
00:03:06,344 --> 00:03:09,512
Bart... I mean Bartholomieux.

67
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,940
When are you planning to drop the beat?

68
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:14,501
Apparently, it's very important.

69
00:03:14,503 --> 00:03:17,504
Evening, Homer, or should I say morning?

70
00:03:17,506 --> 00:03:19,673
Listen, you know I like
to keep my blankets dry

71
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:23,100
and my parties unpooped,
but, uh, all this, well,

72
00:03:23,178 --> 00:03:24,936
noise, I guess you'd call it,

73
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:28,014
is making it difficult for
me and my boys to sleep.

74
00:03:28,016 --> 00:03:29,291
It's not noise.

75
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:31,685
It's a tantalizing journey into sound.

76
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:35,780
Well, could you at least ask
Bart to turn it diddly down?

77
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,207
What?!

78
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:38,875
Turn it diddly down!

What you got there, Flanders?

90
00:04:08,557 --> 00:04:10,740
Well, sir, it occurred to me that, uh,

91
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,650
if I'm a little, uh,

92
00:04:12,728 --> 00:04:14,986
inconvenienced by Bart's
musical endeavors,

93
00:04:15,063 --> 00:04:17,513
it's, uh,
really up to me to find a solution.

94
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,800
So I went out and purchased
three pairs of these good boys.

95
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:23,043
Noice-canceling headphones, eh?

96
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:24,878
Man, I've always wanted to try those.

97
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:26,789
Mind if I take them out for a test spin?

98
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,232
Well, actually, I...

99
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,109
Thanks, neighbor.

100
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,479
Hello there, Mrs. McCormick.

101
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:37,575
Dark times shall come
to Evergreen Terrace

102
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,893
before the year is out.

103
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:42,655
Oh, Mrs. McCormick,

104
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:45,249
I do so enjoy your dire portents.

105
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,651
Oh, this beat's getting pretty big.

106
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,670
Maybe I'll drop it soon.

107
00:04:57,746 --> 00:04:59,989
Or maybe I won't.

108
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:02,082
For God's sake, drop it, Bartholomieux!

109
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,252
The tension, while delicious,
is unbearable!

110
00:05:21,512 --> 00:05:25,623
Daddy, this noise
unto the Lord isn't joyful.

111
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:03,995
Bart, what happened?

112
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:07,498
The beat, I waited too long to drop it.

113
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,650
It was like a tiger in a cage,

114
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:12,228
and I just kept taunting it.

115
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:16,399
Yates was right: "Things fall apart.

116
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:18,083
The center cannot hold."

117
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,069
And when he wrote that in 1918,

118
00:06:20,071 --> 00:06:22,405
they didn't even have DJs.

119
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:23,830
I'm sorry, Dad,

120
00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:26,517
but I'm out of the DJ game.

121
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,910
But what about my mansion?

122
00:06:27,912 --> 00:06:30,188
I've already started
interviewing butlers.

123
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:32,857
I used to think DJs
were overpaid frauds,

124
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:36,101
but I now know they require
the nerves of a surgeon

125
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:38,087
and the rare gift of turning music

126
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:40,256
into faster, louder music.

127
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:42,992
If anything, they aren't paid enough.

128
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,371
Sorry, guys.

129
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,948
You can all go home.

130
00:06:49,024 --> 00:06:50,857
- Right, very good, sir.
- As you wish, sir.

131
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,901
It's been an honor, sir.

132
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:57,623
I'm just glad we were able to
sleep through your big explode-o

133
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,719
thanks to those noise-canceling
headphones your father bought.

134
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,721
Oh, actually, I didn't buy them.

135
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,890
I-I kind of borrowed them from Flanders.

136
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,300
So Ned and his boys
had to spend the night

137
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:10,377
enduring that... no offense, Bart...

138
00:07:10,455 --> 00:07:11,620
racket?!

139
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:13,956
Homer Simpson,
you return those headphones

140
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,792
and apologize immediately.

141
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:18,218
Fine.

142
00:07:18,296 --> 00:07:20,363
The things I do for this family.

143
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:23,466
Oh, hey, Flanders.

144
00:07:23,468 --> 00:07:25,150
I was just bringing back
your headphones.

145
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:27,227
Oh, you don't look so good.

146
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:29,747
Did you get beat up at the circus?

147
00:07:29,898 --> 00:07:32,250
Homer, this sweater is the one thing

148
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,585
you've never, ever borrowed from me.

149
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,495
So I'm giving it to you now.

150
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,906
Hmm. Hmm-hmm.

151
00:07:39,984 --> 00:07:42,426
Ah, it's a little small.

152
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,078
Now that I've literally given
you the shirt off my back,

153
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:49,433
you and I will never have any
reason to interact ever again.

154
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:55,231
In fact, these are the last
words I'll ever say to you.

155
00:07:56,334 --> 00:07:59,184
Oh, I've never seen Ned that upset.

156
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:02,280
Ned Flanders is never
going to speak to me again?

157
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,616
Ever? I guess I only have two words.

158
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,267
Woo-hoo!

159
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:11,514
The dark times have begun.

160
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:16,485
Some days I wish Mrs.
McCormick had never moved here.

161
00:08:23,827 --> 00:08:25,546
So, Flanders thinks he'll never speak

162
00:08:25,591 --> 00:08:27,131
another word to me again, eh?

163
00:08:27,176 --> 00:08:29,698
Well, I say woo-hoo.

164
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,808
Have I said woo-hoo yet?

165
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,436
You have, Homer.

166
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,129
Well, it bears repeating.

167
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:38,649
I mean, does he think
I enjoy talking to him?

168
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,543
Because I don't.

169
00:08:44,048 --> 00:08:45,397
You're right, if anything,

170
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:48,050
it should be me that never
says another word to him.

171
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:51,387
In fact, do you know
who the real victim is?

172
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:52,571
Is it you?

173
00:08:52,648 --> 00:08:53,706
Bingo.

174
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:57,409
However, if Flanders thinks
that by not talking to me,

175
00:08:57,486 --> 00:08:59,578
he... wins,

176
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,154
I cannot allow that to happen.

177
00:09:01,232 --> 00:09:05,234
By this time tomorrow,
he'll be talking my ear off.

178
00:09:05,236 --> 00:09:06,552
Great plan.

179
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:08,904
It is a great plan,

180
00:09:08,906 --> 00:09:10,431
and I'll tell you why.

181
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,741
I'm asleep, aren't I?

182
00:09:12,743 --> 00:09:14,143
Yes.

183
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,581
Listen up, Flanders, we need to talk

184
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,508
about this so-called
"vow of silence" of yours.

185
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:23,027
You go first.

186
00:09:25,423 --> 00:09:28,924
I've never seen my
daddy so angry before.

187
00:09:28,926 --> 00:09:30,350
It's like a bad movie.

188
00:09:30,428 --> 00:09:32,370
Have you ever seen a movie, Todd?

189
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,113
No. What happens?

190
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:36,432
- A lot of stuff.
- Neat!

191
00:09:36,434 --> 00:09:39,785
Oh, my dad has done so many
bad things to your dad,

192
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:42,121
and I think your dad
has finally had enough.

193
00:09:42,197 --> 00:09:44,773
I really don't think
this is gonna blow over.

194
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:46,484
Oh, my God.

195
00:09:46,535 --> 00:09:47,943
Look what's blowing over.

196
00:09:47,945 --> 00:09:49,795
Leaves from my tree.

197
00:09:49,872 --> 00:09:51,538
And they're going into Flanders' yard.

198
00:09:51,616 --> 00:09:54,133
Neighbors fight over this
kind of thing all the time,

199
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:57,786
so I bet you have something
to say to me about it.

200
00:09:57,788 --> 00:09:58,954
Oh, come on, Flanders.

201
00:09:58,956 --> 00:10:00,305
Yell or something.

202
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:01,790
Put me in my place.

203
00:10:04,219 --> 00:10:07,646
Should we help your dad or
wait till he stops twitching?

204
00:10:07,723 --> 00:10:10,074
I find it's best to wait.

205
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:12,460
_

206
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:16,989
Sir, I'm about to make your day.

207
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:19,308
I just need a full oral presentation

208
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,919
on all of your left-handed wares.

209
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,254
Spoken, please.

210
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:28,742
Left-handed apple peeler.

211
00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:30,410
Left-handed chip clip.

212
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,837
Left-handed belt buckle.

213
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:33,489
<i>Big Book of Left-Handed Compliments.</i>

214
00:10:33,491 --> 00:10:34,492
Hmm.

215
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:37,623
_

216
00:10:40,876 --> 00:10:42,079
_

217
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:51,356
Oh, I should've known
he'd have a backup Savior.

218
00:10:53,326 --> 00:10:55,169
_

219
00:10:55,346 --> 00:10:57,680
All the ladies in the house, go, "Hey!"

220
00:10:57,682 --> 00:10:58,847
Hey!

221
00:10:58,849 --> 00:11:01,533
All the fellas in the house, go, "Whoo!"

222
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,851
Whoo!

223
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:05,963
All the Flanders in the house,
say anything!

224
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,192
Everybody in the house,
give me a second.

225
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:21,553
Oh, boy.

226
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:23,981
Hiya, Marge.

227
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,874
To what do I owe my guest appearance

228
00:11:25,876 --> 00:11:27,392
in your blessed day?

229
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:30,988
Actually, Ned,
I was wondering if you and I could maybe

230
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,550
discuss this situation
between you and Homer.

231
00:11:34,552 --> 00:11:35,642
Of course we could.

232
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,994
Come on in.

233
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,908
_

234
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:48,538
_

235
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,826
So? So? Did he talk about me?

236
00:11:52,903 --> 00:11:54,494
He sure did.

237
00:11:55,097 --> 00:11:56,588
I got to say, Homer,

238
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:57,998
if I weren't married to you,

239
00:11:58,075 --> 00:12:00,684
I probably wouldn't talk to you, either.

240
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,245
Oh, I can't take this anymore.

241
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:05,005
I thought Flanders not talking to me

242
00:12:05,082 --> 00:12:06,357
would be a magical Mardi Gras,

243
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:09,251
but instead it's been
a never-ending Lent.

244
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,105
Lent!

245
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:15,257
Then why not do the one
thing you haven't done?

246
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:16,925
Apologize.

247
00:12:16,927 --> 00:12:17,927
That's it.

248
00:12:17,928 --> 00:12:19,444
I'll write him an apology.

249
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:47,213
Hmm, mm-hmm.

250
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,924
Mm-hmm.

251
00:12:48,926 --> 00:12:51,202
Actually, Dad, it's good.

252
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,352
Really good.

253
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:55,688
I had no idea you had such
depths of feeling in you.

254
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:57,432
I mean, wow.

255
00:12:57,434 --> 00:12:59,359
You did quote the movie <i>Point Break</i>

256
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,527
more than I expected, but I really think

257
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:03,939
Mr. Flanders may finally forgive you.

258
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:05,457
I hope you're right.

259
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:08,218
I bared my whole soul in this letter,
and it feels amazing.

260
00:13:08,295 --> 00:13:11,805
Writers must be the happiest
people in the world.

261
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,601
Knock 'em dead, Dad.

262
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,145
Aah, we've been burgled!

263
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,371
That's our stuff! What are you doing?

264
00:13:39,826 --> 00:13:42,920
You have to tell me why
you're destroying my stuff!

265
00:13:42,996 --> 00:13:46,498
It's my stuff, you imbecile.

266
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:49,484
I'm reclaiming everything
you've ever borrowed from me

267
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:51,987
and destroying it so you
can never borrow it again.

268
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:54,431
That includes the lock
on your front door.

269
00:13:55,842 --> 00:13:57,917
But what about my apology?

270
00:13:57,995 --> 00:14:00,178
Homer, your apology was beautiful,

271
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:02,422
heartfelt and enraging!

272
00:14:02,499 --> 00:14:03,665
Huh?

273
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:05,500
You know,
I gave you a pass all these years

274
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:07,760
'cause I thought you were
just too dumb to know better,

275
00:14:07,838 --> 00:14:10,355
but this eloquent plea for forgiveness

276
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:14,160
shows you're a thinking,
feeling human being,

277
00:14:14,195 --> 00:14:16,328
and you did that stuff to me anyway!

278
00:14:17,926 --> 00:14:18,622
My couch!

279
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:21,124
The one thing in this
world I truly love.

280
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:22,608
It's my couch.

281
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,520
You borrowed it from me
the very first day we met.

282
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,174
I've got to get over there
and stop this madness!

283
00:14:34,548 --> 00:14:36,531
Gone to Flanders' to save couch.

284
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:38,308
Home for dinner.

285
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:41,228
My car.

286
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:43,705
You killed my car!

287
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:45,040
Okay, mister,

288
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:46,858
I'll kill your car.

289
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,828
Car fight!

290
00:14:57,904 --> 00:15:00,222
Car fight! Car fight!

291
00:15:00,224 --> 00:15:02,165
Car fight!

292
00:15:21,745 --> 00:15:23,437
I don't want to hear it.

293
00:15:32,547 --> 00:15:34,847
What do you two chuckleheads
have to say for yourselves?

294
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:36,349
I hate him more than Joab

295
00:15:36,426 --> 00:15:38,351
hated Abner in the Book of Samuel.

296
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:40,353
I hate him more than Tennessee Tuxedo

297
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,614
hated the tedium of his life in the zoo.

298
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:44,449
- I don't know what to say to you.
- Oh, yeah?

299
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,102
Well, Chumley the Walrus
has a lot more to say

300
00:15:47,104 --> 00:15:49,362
about this situation...

301
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:51,531
I have never seen two people
with such a bitter hatred

302
00:15:51,608 --> 00:15:54,943
for each other outside of
happily married couples.

303
00:15:54,945 --> 00:15:57,370
Hmm, well, that gives me an
idea for one of my folksy,

304
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,781
movie premise-like judgments.

305
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:02,708
Instead of jail,
I sentence the two of you

306
00:16:02,786 --> 00:16:05,287
to 100 hours of couples counseling.

307
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:09,291
- D'oh!
- Permission to use profanity, Your Honor?

308
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:10,642
I'll allow it.

309
00:16:10,718 --> 00:16:11,902
Marmalade milkshake!

310
00:16:14,122 --> 00:16:16,177
_

311
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:18,650
Look, I need you both to know

312
00:16:18,726 --> 00:16:21,227
that this isn't gonna
be an overnight fix.

313
00:16:21,305 --> 00:16:24,472
It could take years of intensive,
soul-baring...

314
00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:27,826
Could you please stop flicking
each other in the eyeballs?

315
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:34,240
All right,
that does it for talk therapy.

316
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:35,926
Luckily, there are drugs.

317
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,153
- I don't do drugs.
- I'll have his.

318
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:40,430
There have been amazing
advances in the use

319
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:43,658
of therapeutic psychedelics
for dysfunctional couples.

320
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,717
U-completamine will take
you on a shared journey

321
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:48,087
that could help resolve your conflict,

322
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:50,756
with only a slight risk of
permanent brain explosion,

323
00:16:50,758 --> 00:16:52,109
or "PBE."

324
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:54,002
I'll happily blow up both our brains

325
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:57,430
if there's the slightest chance
of making Ned suck less.

326
00:16:58,306 --> 00:17:00,266
I can't live with this anger anymore.

327
00:17:00,344 --> 00:17:02,360
Let's just do it.

328
00:17:03,343 --> 00:17:06,181
<i>The drug is now slowly
entering your bloodstream.</i>

329
00:17:06,183 --> 00:17:07,866
Just relax and remember...

330
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:09,275
if you see a door, open it.

331
00:17:09,353 --> 00:17:10,794
If you see a road, follow it.

332
00:17:10,871 --> 00:17:12,370
And most importantly...

333
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:16,858
we don't take insurance.

334
00:17:18,862 --> 00:17:19,863
I'm scared.

335
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,098
- Where are we going?
- I don't dang-diddly know.

336
00:17:24,082 --> 00:17:26,025
Soul sensors activate.

337
00:17:26,102 --> 00:17:28,269
How many of you beautiful
mutants are ready

338
00:17:28,345 --> 00:17:31,422
to drop some serious repressed emotions?

339
00:17:37,512 --> 00:17:39,539
What the hell is going on?

340
00:17:39,615 --> 00:17:41,249
We're cartoons.

341
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:47,605
Garfunkel!

342
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:48,840
Turtlenecks!

343
00:17:56,183 --> 00:17:58,683
Good grief!

344
00:17:59,894 --> 00:18:02,470
Why did we turn into
all those famous duos?

345
00:18:02,546 --> 00:18:03,637
Famous?

346
00:18:03,714 --> 00:18:05,398
I didn't recognize any of them.

347
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,597
Now we have
no corporeal form!

348
00:18:13,649 --> 00:18:15,825
Nice going, Flanders.

349
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,416
Everyone's dead.

350
00:18:41,494 --> 00:18:45,254
Which means no one's
defending your brain castle.

351
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,840
Flanders' head is full of me.

352
00:18:55,842 --> 00:18:59,202
Homer has a shrine to me?

353
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:04,682
I think I get it now.

354
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:07,018
I see how happy and successful you are,

355
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,944
so I think I'm not worthy of you.

356
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,298
I treat you terribly out
of my own insecurity.

357
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:16,360
Also because you've got awesome
stuff and I like taking it.

358
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:19,030
And I wish I could savor
life half as much as you do.

359
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:23,142
But what I truly love is
feeling morally superior to you.

360
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:26,203
That's why I accept and even
encourage your worst behavior.

361
00:19:26,205 --> 00:19:28,297
Like how you're scratching your butt

362
00:19:28,374 --> 00:19:29,557
with that statue of me.

363
00:19:31,302 --> 00:19:32,819
What? It's pointy.

364
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:37,731
So I-I guess what we really
want is the status quo.

365
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:39,975
Status whoa!

366
00:19:39,977 --> 00:19:42,887
Another U-completamine breakthrough.

367
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:45,222
Well, how is it possible
we had the exact same

368
00:19:45,224 --> 00:19:46,907
psychedelic sleigh ride?

369
00:19:46,984 --> 00:19:48,726
And why are you a part of it?

370
00:19:48,728 --> 00:19:49,836
I couldn't tell you.

371
00:19:49,912 --> 00:19:51,987
No one has any idea
how these drugs work.

372
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,339
Bye!

373
00:19:58,738 --> 00:20:00,930
Well, Homer, any thoughts?

374
00:20:02,742 --> 00:20:06,260
Oh, Flanders!

375
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:14,935
Homer, did you take my paper again?

376
00:20:15,012 --> 00:20:17,438
No. Why would you say that?

377
00:20:17,514 --> 00:20:19,014
Because you're holding it.

378
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,425
Florida has a hockey team?

379
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:23,252
You know what, Homer?

380
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,945
Okily-dokily.

381
00:20:25,022 --> 00:20:29,041
Ned, I got something for you.

382
00:20:29,118 --> 00:20:31,602
My sweater.

383
00:20:31,604 --> 00:20:32,937
Thanks, neighborino.

384
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:36,107
