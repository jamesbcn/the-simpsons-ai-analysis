1
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,927
And now to order
my Christmas gifts

2
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:28,328
with plenty of time.

3
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:55,489
UPS tracking says
my packages just arrived.

4
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,391
All I have to do is look down.

5
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,129
Who could've done this?
Who?

6
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,131
<i>Ding-dong, merrily on high</i>

7
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:07,301
<i>In heaven the bells
are ringing</i>

8
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,603
<i>Ding-dong, Bart is gonna die</i>

9
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,773
<i>His little neck,
I'm stringing</i>

10
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:15,943
Needs tinsel

11
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,379
to reflect
the horror in Bart's eyes.

12
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,552
Oh, a visitor. Coming.

13
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,457
Ahoy! Are there any lonely
lighthouse keepers abaft here?

14
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:32,793
Oh, hello, Cassandra.

15
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,396
Surprise! I made you muffins.

16
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,031
You want to know a secret?

17
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,200
I used two sticks of butter.

18
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,636
Do you have any
deep dark secrets?

19
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,451
Merry Christmas, Father!

20
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:58,952
Stay out of trouble.

21
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,193
Nope. No secrets.

22
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,261
So, have you ever
thought about children?

23
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,065
Missed me! Missed me!
Now you gotta kiss me!

24
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,537
Oh, if you'll excuse me,

25
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,474
my gimbals need
a good whale oiling.

26
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,243
You might get
some other visitors.

27
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,312
I mentioned you in town today.

28
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,749
You told people about me?
What did you tell them?! What?!

29
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,284
That you had kind eyes,
a beautiful voice,

30
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,753
and no wedding ring.

31
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:36,289
There he is!

32
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,525
I was a fool to let
my guard down with a woman

33
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:41,294
who runs a seaward-aiming
Fresnel lens!

34
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:45,232
From hell's heart
I stab at thee!

35
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,135
Oh, my God. Just listen to that
mellifluous baritone.

36
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,803
He's perfect for the role.

37
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,705
Role? Role?

38
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,807
You're offering me
an acting job?

39
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:57,277
Yes! It's to play Santa Claus
at a small amusement park.

40
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:02,215
Oh, what the hell.
It is the lead. I'm in!

41
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,585
Dinner is served.

42
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,265
Hey, let's see
what's on your tag.

43
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,400
Cadaver-sniffing dog?!

44
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,136
Ah, that's another job
I didn't get.

45
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,547
It's gone.
My porch repair kit is gone!

46
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,060
D'oh!

47
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:52,466
A little help!

48
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,503
Another crafts project
gone out of hand?

49
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,372
- Yes.
- If you're not tied up tomorrow,

50
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,108
I took the day off from work.

51
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:04,911
I was thinking we could watch
an R-rated movie.

52
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:09,249
Finally, the sexy story
of Tony Roma's ribs.

53
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:12,285
But tomorrow I promised the kids
I'd take them out of school.

54
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,254
It can be our family day.

55
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,790
We'll go to Santa's Village.

56
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,926
Oh, I hate that place.
It's so crowded at Christmas.

57
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,995
And the giant candy canes
are not real.

58
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,930
But they are electrified!

59
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,533
Well, we're going
and taking the kids.

60
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,703
Why couldn't that be me?

61
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:34,474
Homer!

62
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,615
<i>Baby shark,
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo</i>

63
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,750
<i>Baby shark,
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo</i>

64
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:46,086
Oh, God, I'm so sick of this.

65
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,388
Thing just keeps going
on and on.

66
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,423
I don't want to hear a shark

67
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,425
or baby or doo ever again.

68
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,427
Marge, you traitor!

69
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,197
It's so catchy.

70
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:58,565
Oh, what the hell.

71
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,801
<i>Daddy shark,
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo</i>

72
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,936
<i>Daddy shark,
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo</i>

73
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,104
<i>Daddy shark</i>

74
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,173
Play this at my funeral!

75
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,315
Why do the low-budget parks
we go to

76
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:18,318
have so many white trash idiots?

77
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,153
Boy, that's good.

78
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,855
Why? Why?

79
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:23,490
Well, I'm getting
right in line for Santa.

80
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,267
Eight hours to see
a fat lazy drunk-o?

81
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,003
I came to this park
to get away from one.

82
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,539
Even Chanukah Hollow
is packed.

83
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,944
Check out the Dreidel Casino.

84
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,848
Come on, gimmel, gimmel, gimmel!

85
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,749
Ah, shin again!

86
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:50,951
I thought this would be

87
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,253
the one part of Judaism
I'm good at.

88
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,291
Typical.

89
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,728
The one ride is a stupid,
boring kiddie ride.

90
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,397
At least you get to have fun.

91
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:18,545
<i>It's a scary place
in the world outside</i>

92
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:22,249
<i>Gnomes are watching you,
so you'd best not cry</i>

93
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,417
<i>Don't display any fear,
this we know</i>

94
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,253
<i>Yes, it's clear,
all our eyes</i>

95
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,456
<i>Are watching you</i>

96
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,292
<i>It's a scary place
in the world outside</i>

97
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:36,296
<i>Gnomes are watching you,
so you'd best not cry</i>

98
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:39,432
<i>Don't display any fear,
this we know, yes, it's clear</i>

99
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:43,737
<i>All our eyes
are watching you</i>

100
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,009
Hey, buddy, thanks
for saving me a spot.

101
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,311
Bart, you cut the bullies.

102
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,448
In this situation,
we assign equal blame

103
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,350
to the cutter and the cuttee.

104
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,319
Let him go.
I don't want to get blood

105
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:00,620
on my Christmas sweater.

106
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:03,556
Oh, there's gonna be blood
on your sweater, all right.

107
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,092
I just said I didn't want that!

108
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,280
Hello, young man.

109
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:29,049
Climb right up.

110
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,483
Santa?
Bartholomew Simpson.

111
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,552
- You don't know me, but...
- Oh, but I do.

112
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,855
Hello-ho-ho, Bart.

113
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,791
Sideshow Bob!

114
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,392
Merry Christmas.

115
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,001
He's in a good mood.

116
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,403
Yes. This is the year
I get the monkey.

117
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,571
I keep telling you,

118
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,374
a monkey is a huge
responsibility.

119
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:57,877
I'm raising a kid.
I think I can raise a monkey.

120
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:11,057
So easy.
After all these years,

121
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:14,828
I get to watch the life drain
from your eye, your...

122
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:18,131
I can't kill you!

123
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,734
- Want to know why?
- Nah.

124
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,470
I am a trained method actor.

125
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,171
I inhabit my roles.

126
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,340
Like Daniel Day-Lewis
in Phantom Thread.

127
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,509
Or Mike Myers
in The Love Guru.

128
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,378
Why should I trust you?

129
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,347
Because I am utterly incapable
of stepping out of character.

130
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:36,683
I am Santa Claus.

131
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,718
The jolly old elf himself.

132
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,689
So can we get in to see you?

133
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:46,860
15-minute break.
Santa's making presents.

134
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,634
I'm telling you,
this is Sideshow Bob!

135
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,771
- He tried to kill me!
- Well?

136
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,140
I am a card-carrying
seasonal Santa.

137
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,143
Kris Kringle Union, Local 5732.

138
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,178
Hey, I was a mall Santa too.

139
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,414
I still wear the belt.

140
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,783
If you're gonna spend
this much time with our Santa,

141
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,284
you have to pose for a photo.

142
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,353
Photos with Santa, $40.

143
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,288
Marge, just take one
with your phone!

144
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,790
- Got it.
- Run!

145
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,293
This will stop the jerks
who've been stealing packages

146
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,930
off my porch, a decoy with
an exploding dye marker inside.

147
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,299
You don't think you packed in
a little too much gunpowder?

148
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:29,469
Relax. I learned how to do this
from my Uncle Two Fingers.

149
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,973
Oh, my God.
You're the package thief?

150
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:40,146
Lenny. Who did this to you?
Can you say it?

151
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,248
Can you whisper it?

152
00:09:42,314 --> 00:09:45,284
Can you write it
with your blood?

153
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,294
I'm a little worried
our Christmas packages

154
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,795
haven't arrived.

155
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:58,531
Marge, relax.
There's plenty of time.

156
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,267
It's 8:00 p.m. Christmas Eve!

157
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:06,139
Just sit back and watch
this Fox News yule log.

158
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,747
We interrupt this yule log
with a special report.

159
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,050
Package delivery thefts
continue in Springfield.

160
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,252
Local man
Leonard "Lenny" Leonard

161
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:23,323
had his jingle bell rung
in a package deal gone boom.

162
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,392
Our only clue is these initials
next to the corpse.

163
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,428
He's not a corpse.
He's breathing.

164
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:32,398
- I say he's a corpse.
- And I say I'm not.

165
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,501
You don't get a vote.

166
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,903
S.B. is Sideshow Bob!

167
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,404
That's what he's up to.

168
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,340
He's stealing Christmas!

169
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,343
A fellow Santa
could not steal Christmas.

170
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:47,113
I know who this mysterious
S.B. is.

171
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:51,985
Welcome to jail, Selma Bouvier.

172
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,053
Tell Scott Bakula,
Steve Ballmer

173
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,089
and Sandra Bullock
they're off the hook.

174
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,424
I should've been back
at NCIS New Orleans

175
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,260
two hours ago.

176
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,262
Why don't you just
Quantum Leap there?

177
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,231
Why don't you learn
how to be a cop, fatso?

178
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,333
I loved it!
Mistaken identity!

179
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,871
I sold ten, ten season tickets
to the guys in my cell.

180
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:15,942
Everything we do is successful,
booyah!

181
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:32,292
Santa's Village, please.

182
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,660
What do you want
to go there for?

183
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,495
I'm saving Christmas.

184
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:38,498
Every kid thinks they're
doing that this time of year.

185
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,733
And as for you, Santa's Village
is closed, I'm afraid.

186
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,102
If I wanted your life story,
I would've taken an Uber.

187
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,871
Well, that shuts me up.

188
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,773
I'm not gonna leave

189
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,408
till I find out
what Bob's up to.

190
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,443
If you don't hear from me
in one hour, call the police.

191
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,579
I have my own problems, Bart.

192
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,348
My mom just locked my dad out
in the snow.

193
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,350
He keeps tapping at my window.

194
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:00,119
She said if I open it,
no presents.

195
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,322
- Useless.
- Don't hang up.

196
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:11,197
Classic evil villain mistake.

197
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,334
Life goals?!

198
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,002
Don't pooh-pooh.

199
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,171
Now for God's sake,
how can I convince you

200
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,340
that I am not
going to kill you?!

201
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:24,143
Find the person
who stole the presents.

202
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,346
Very well. I shall begin
by clearing my initials,

203
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,450
catching the true S.B.
and, if I must,

204
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:33,386
save Christmas for everyone.

205
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,355
Now let me drive you home.

206
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,524
You want me
to ride with you? Fine.

207
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,792
Shotgun!

208
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:43,495
Let's roll.

209
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:44,863
Shotgun means you pay the tolls.

210
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:51,170
So I'm here to save Christmas,
and here's my plan.

211
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,540
First, I conceal myself
within this box.

212
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,014
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

213
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,616
When you ride cross-country
in a clown car, you learn a lot.

214
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,322
Who knew?

215
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,623
- Brava!
- Who knew?

216
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,858
Thank you.

217
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,060
Now, Homer,
gently place me on the porch,

218
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,562
and when they steal me,
follow them to their lair.

219
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,231
Will do.

220
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,374
And...

221
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,743
Godspeed.

222
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,845
They'll be here any minute.

223
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,643
Can't breathe.

224
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,189
<i>Baby shark,
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo</i>

225
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,725
<i>Baby shark,
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo</i>

226
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,360
<i>Baby shark,
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo</i>

227
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,071
Oh, my God, S.B. is

228
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,906
Smithers and Burns!

229
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,875
Since when does Smithers
go first?

230
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:36,943
The jig is up!

231
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,312
Also, leg cramp.

232
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,516
The police are on their way.

233
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,519
Who will they believe?
You or the billionaire

234
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:49,489
who just sent them
a Montgomery Ward's cheese log?

235
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,458
Mr. Burns, why did you do this?

236
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,494
Ooh, general Scroogeyness.

237
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,497
No, it's deeper.
It's much deeper than that.

238
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,366
I think Mr. Burns is depressed.

239
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,302
Ooh, you're a very
perceptive girl.

240
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,572
That's close enough.

241
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,408
I just wanted everyone
to experience

242
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,711
the same Christmas heartbreak
that I once did.

243
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:15,615
<i>Good King Wenceslas
looked out</i>

244
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,417
<i>On the feast of Stephen</i>

245
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:21,320
Papa, sweet Papa,
may I sit on Santa's lap?

246
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,089
Well, I don't know.

247
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:26,092
Santa Claus,
giving away free toys,

248
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,328
undercutting my friends,
Bill Mattel and Fred Hasbro.

249
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,230
Please?

250
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,639
Well, what's on your wish list,
little boy?

251
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,308
A Rockford sock monkey,
Studebaker pedal car,

252
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,344
or the most popular gift
this year, an orange.

253
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,980
All I want is a hug
from my mommy

254
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,816
and a smile from my daddy.

255
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,852
Oh, well I'm sure
there's a hug and a smile

256
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:56,422
on their way to you right now.

257
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,090
Next.

258
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,859
What do you want for Christmas?

259
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,428
I want you to marry my mom
like you said you would.

260
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:03,763
Next!

261
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,374
Christmas day came...

262
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,383
I'm here to take you
to boarding school.

263
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,386
- On Christmas Day?
- Hey, no traffic.

264
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:34,460
The next time I saw my parents,
they weren't in a smiling mood.

265
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,432
Too late!

266
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:43,102
You two never gave me anything
except $100 million.

267
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,504
Santa lied.

268
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,772
But, Monty,
you misunderstood me.

269
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,276
Santa? It can't be.

270
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,079
Monty, it's 1935,

271
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,548
and this is
Gimbels Department Store,

272
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,550
with the toy train
in the window

273
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,919
and Maxie the elevator man.

274
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:02,255
You're looking
at the lingerie department.

275
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,524
You can look. It's okay.

276
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:09,362
Yes. Yes. Yes!
I am a child again.

277
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,364
And the truth is,
your parents did love you,

278
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,166
not with hugs and kisses,
but with something better.

279
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,535
They made you strong.

280
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,104
Where are all the other tycoons
from your day?

281
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,874
Broke, dead, a lot of #MeToo.

282
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:25,711
But you're the richest,
most ruthless man in town,

283
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,347
thanks to your parents' love.

284
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,386
It's true.

285
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:34,921
Smithers, it's Christmas,

286
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,323
which is a work day for you,
so help me out.

287
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,493
- And it's my birthday.
- Don't expect two presents.

288
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,896
<i>Christmas,
the snow's coming down</i>

289
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:47,266
<i>Christmas,
I'm watching it fall</i>

290
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,235
<i>Christmas...</i>

291
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:51,904
My raisins came!

292
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,707
Well, at least he's eating.

293
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,743
<i>Christmas...</i>

294
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,780
Huzzah for Mr. Burns!

295
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,049
God bless us, every one.

296
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,418
Seriously, this is,
this is really nice.

297
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,889
We did it.

298
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:12,224
Got all the presents
under the tree.

299
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,828
I'm lucky because no one
could possibly steal my gift.

300
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,464
All I want
is one peaceful moment

301
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,967
to hold my wife in my arms.

302
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:25,438
It's Christmas!

303
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,607
Awake already?

304
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:31,277
- Slide whistle.
- Kazoo!

305
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,850
Meet me in the basement.

306
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,485
Okay.

307
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:40,953
Picture time.

308
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,831
Janey, haven't you learned
that silly tune yet?

309
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,300
You play it over and over again.
Now stop it, stop it!

310
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,502
That girl is pretty bad
at the piano.

311
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,439
Hello, Cassandra.

312
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,441
I brought you
a Christmas present.

313
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:08,447
I know who you are,
and I know what you've done,

314
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,516
and I want you to kiss me.

315
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:14,286
- <i>You really should go</i>
- <i>It's 20 below</i>

316
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:18,224
- <i>I can't have you here</i>
- <i>Just get me a beer</i>

317
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,527
- <i>I'm being a gent</i>
- <i>I'm giving consent</i>

318
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:24,463
<i>You are quite inviting</i>

319
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,366
<i>I will put it in writing</i>

320
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:32,738
<i>Baby, it's cold outside</i>

321
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:41,347
Will someone
turn on the damn light?!

322
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:44,283
A little late, don't you think?

323
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,818
Yarr!

324
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,290
Steve. Steve. Wait.

325
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:55,261
Sorry, I'm just about ready
to leave your wonderful town.

326
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,864
Great place. Fantastic!

327
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:02,435
The best Springfield
I've ever been in.

328
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,871
Can you teach me to do that?

329
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,707
Do what? This is just me.

330
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:12,144
Fantastic coffee!
Send a truckful to Seattle.

331
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,580
How can you possibly
be so happy?

332
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,783
- It's in you too.
- I really don't think so.

333
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,785
Monty, look me in the eye.

334
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,854
I don't know if I can.

335
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,193
You're amazingly alive,

336
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,962
you're rich beyond
any sense of justice,

337
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:33,999
you're C. Montgomery Burns.

338
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,340
Hurt yourself
on the landing, huh?

339
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,209
No, on the way up.
