1
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:07,048
The Simpsons

2
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,190
D'oh!

3
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,131
A- ha! A free baseball!

4
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,342
A shiny new dime!

5
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,345
A shinier new dime!

6
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,434
Excuse me.
My refrigeration
unit is broken.

7
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,937
Could you possibly eat
some free ice cream?

8
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:49,400
What flavor?
Why, super chocolate,
of course. Oh, yes!

9
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,112
This day just keeps
getting better and better.

10
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:55,698
And here's a new
four-legged friend
for me.

11
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,159
Hiya, boy.
Haven't seen you
around here before.

12
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,379
Mom! A dog ate
my clothes!

13
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,299
Nice try,
but we're still
going to Riverdance.

14
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,383
D'oh!

15
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,721
You know that new
baby brother Ralph's
been bragging about?

16
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,140
It's just a pinecone.

17
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,317
Let's go where
it's quiet.

18
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,443
Help!

19
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,153
Isn't that
your brother?

20
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:35,822
I said, let's go.

21
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,534
Eh, I'm sick of
this Tarzan movie.

22
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,578
Dad, it's a documentary
on the homeless.

23
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:43,746
Oh, right.

24
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,624
A crazy dog's
trying to kill me!

25
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,918
Really? Ooh!
This I gotta see.

26
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,381
Oh, he just wants
to make friends.

27
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:58,719
Ooh! Who's a good dog?
What a goody doggie!

28
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,347
He just a googie...

29
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,183
So, Bart, when does
the killing start?

30
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:20,449
Look, Bart,
sometimes dogs or people
hate you for no reason.

31
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,847
Bart's a goner.

32
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,724
Anyone want to be
my new best friend?

33
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:45,850
I will!

34
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,520
Great! Finally,
I'll be the dominant one.

35
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,063
Be quiet.

36
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,273
Yes, sir.

37
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,486
Ha-ha! Bart's
family is poor!

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,085
Hurry up,
Bart, or you'll be late
to be killed by the dog!

39
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,128
What?

40
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,880
I said you'll be
late for school!

41
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,724
Eat my short stories!

42
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:04,345
Phew! Safe at last!
Now, I'll just turn around
and confirm that safety.

43
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,481
Hey, wait a minute.
These animals are stuffed.

44
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,858
Except that one.

45
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:23,656
Don't worry about
these critters. They're
just props from my movies.

46
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,660
This one's from
Gunfight at the Museum
of Natural History.

47
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,161
You were in movies?

48
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:33,332
Hold onto your hat, son.
You're talking to Buck McCoy.

49
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,667
Who?

50
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,462
Yeah, that's right.
Buck McCoy.

51
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,340
The most famous movie
cowboy in the world.

52
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:45,636
No kidding. Anyway,
I climbed over your gate.
A dog was after me.

53
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,682
I'll show you a trick
that you can use on dogs.

54
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,143
Also worked on
David O. Selznick.

55
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,352
Who?

56
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:57,398
Yeah, that's right.
The David O. Selznick.

57
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,278
Whoa! Keep him
away from me!

58
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,655
Trust me, son.
You'll be fine.

59
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:08,951
Now, lean down
and put your arms
across his neck.

60
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,208
Whoa! It worked!

61
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,712
Where did you learn that?

62
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,797
Ah, you pick things up.

63
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,342
Do you know how to
catch a wild boar
with a teaspoon?

64
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,427
No!

65
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,471
Well, what do you
kids do all day?

66
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,806
Well, right now
I'm supposed to
be in school.

67
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,018
School? Huh! Why bother?
I quit after fourth grade,

68
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,978
and I ain't not no un-dummy.

69
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:41,192
It's
like you're living
in a steakhouse!

70
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:44,320
Well, thank you.
Most people just
mutter that.

71
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,657
Is that horse vacuuming?

72
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,159
If you can
call it that.

73
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,912
He soils as much
as he cleans.

74
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,208
Frank the Wonder Horse
was in 24 of my pictures.

75
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:03,339
And directed one.
And he got
the "film by" credit.

76
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,183
5:00? I better
get home for dinner.

77
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,352
Well, come back
anytime, pardner.

78
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,938
To the laundry room!

79
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,359
Here we are.

80
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:29,907
Hi, honey.
Where's that vicious dog?
I made him a biscuit.

81
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,827
Oh, he's not
bothering me anymore.
Buck McCoy helped me.

82
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,539
Buck McCoy?
He was the greatest
of them all!

83
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,332
He was bigger than opium!

84
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,167
I met one of my heroes today.

85
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,293
She started the first...

86
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,338
Buck McCoy!
I still carry this.

87
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,884
Junior Buckaroo, 2nd Class.
Little Grampa Simpson.

88
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,219
Cool!

89
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,183
After that I starred in
Wyatt Earp Meets The Mummy.

90
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,853
Then Six Brides
For Seven Brothers.

91
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,398
They were pictures
that the whole family
could enjoy.

92
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,234
No drugs,
no nudity, no cussing.

93
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:09,738
Just drinking, fighting
and tripping horses
with wires.

94
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,032
What's this lunchbox made of?

95
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:15,327
Well, back in my day,
we had a thing called metal.

96
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:19,915
Everything was made of it.
Lunchboxes, cars, you name it.

97
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,084
Me-tal.

98
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,171
Hey, can you still
do cowboy tricks?

99
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,424
Well, here's one I did
in The Wild Lunch.

100
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,016
Everything tastes better
when it's lassoed!

101
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,018
Would you lasso
me a banana?

102
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,854
Now how the hell
would I do that?

103
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,359
I guess you're not
going to have an
adventure this week.

104
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,944
Huh. Just you wait.

105
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,446
Hey, boy, where'd
you get that hat?

106
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,614
Buck gave it to me.

107
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,158
He's just about
the greatest guy
who ever lived.

108
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,994
I want to grow up
to be just like him.

109
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,164
No kidding? Hey,
speaking of achievers,

110
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:04,460
they're thinking of
spraying your old man's
workspace for ticks.

111
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:07,213
That's great, champ.
I know you've
been wanting that.

112
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,882
Well, got to mosey,
Homer. Ma'am.

113
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,928
Bart sure is fond of
that cow gentleman.

114
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:17,848
It's just not fair.
This Buck fellow's
had all the advantages.

115
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,852
Horse-riding lessons,
the finest makeup,
delicious studio food.

116
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:25,397
Oh, Homie, you'll always
be my western hero.

117
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,649
Swell.

118
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,403
I can't wait
till I get good.

119
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,949
Buck's here!

120
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,701
Dad, why are you
wearing that?

121
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,411
Because I want
to be your hero.

122
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,914
On top of which,
I don't look bald.

123
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,335
Thanks for coming, Mr. McCoy.
We cooked your favorites.

124
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:50,172
Rattlesnake meat,
varmint kabobs
and refried whiskey.

125
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,758
I like the sound
of that last one.

126
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,552
Don't listen to them,
Buck! It's an ambush!

127
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,846
They're trying to
jump your claim!

128
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,682
Take him outside.

129
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,351
I love you, Buck!

130
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,652
Gee, Buck,
your old films are
as violent as today's!

131
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,862
One of the wheels
broke off my chair today,

132
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,990
but I didn't make
a movie about it.

133
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,576
In the '50s,
I did a TV show.

134
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:24,123
It only lasted a year,
but we did 360 episodes,

135
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,918
all of them great.
I did the commercials myself.

136
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:33,465
Remember kids,
Drunken Cowboy brand
whiskey is smooth as milk!

137
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:36,719
I'm not sure I approve
of selling whiskey
to children.

138
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,014
Well, that ad was aimed
at children who were
already heavy drinkers.

139
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,098
Oh!

140
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,481
Tonight's
episode... "Excuse Me
While I Kill The Sky. "

141
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,816
Why are you driving a car?

142
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:56,989
Yeah, in the '70s,
Westerns were out
and detective shows were in.

143
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,908
It seems like all I did
was shoot hippies.

144
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:08,042
They wrote me out of the show
and it became Room 222.

145
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,170
So that's how you
ended your career?

146
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,339
Yeah, well,
what can you do?

147
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:17,176
The Western went the way
of the evening newspaper
and polio.

148
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,012
Well, I think Westerns
are due for a comeback.

149
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:24,600
Yeah! We can have showdowns
at the schoolyard
and use nerds as Indians.

150
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,197
Bart, you look so cool.

151
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,949
I was thinking this
could be a new fad.

152
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,285
What about
Hawaiian shirts?

153
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,081
Hey, you're not fun,
you're fat!

154
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:51,460
Now, listen up.
When I come back tomorrow,
you better have cowboy suits,

155
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,088
and they better be adorable.

156
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,343
This is Kent Brockman here
at Springfield Elementary,

157
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,596
where a new Western craze
is sweeping the campus.

158
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,223
I'm Annie Oakley!

159
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,309
I'm Kevin Costner
in one of his Western roles!

160
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,894
I'm a gulch!

161
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,437
So I guess you could say

162
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:14,566
this barely
qualifies as news.
I'm Kent Brockman.

163
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:19,738
Oh, give me land
Lots of land

164
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,533
Under starry skies above

165
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:25,869
Don't fence me in

166
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,414
Sir, you cannot pee

167
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:31,250
Unless you are an employee

168
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,254
Can't keep it in

169
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:45,848
Krusty, how do you feel
about putting Buck McCoy
on your show?

170
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,684
Pass!
We also represent
Billy Joel.

171
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,227
Who's the first one again?

172
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,437
Buck McCoy.

173
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,606
Forget it!
I'm not putting
some Western star on

174
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,733
just 'cause it's
the flavor of the month.

175
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,153
I want my show to have
a timeless quality.

176
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,155
Here's your hanging
chad sketch, Krusty.

177
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,992
Oh, good, you
worked in Judge Ito.

178
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,536
Please put Buck on!
He's my hero!

179
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,580
Plus, he'll work for scale.

180
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,373
Scale minus 10.

181
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,544
I ain't going on
some clown show.
I'm retired.

182
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,297
No one expects you
to do anything difficult.

183
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,174
They understand
you're too old.

184
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:25,429
Listen, missy. The last
two city-slickers who used
reverse psychology on me

185
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,389
are pushing up daisies.

186
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,726
They're dead?
No, they just
got lousy jobs.

187
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,855
You know what?
I bet he can't even
fit into his old costume.

188
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,733
I can't, huh?
You two wait
right here.

189
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,827
Let's see,
Texas or Massachusetts?

190
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:49,953
Texas.

191
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,122
I like the way
you think.

192
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,102
Boy,
that's some
fancy shooting.

193
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,896
Oh, I've seen fancier.

194
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,402
Ooh! Right
in the panhandle!

195
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,071
Write that down.

196
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,491
Buck, this is
a real honor.

197
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:31,245
I grew up watching
your horse operas
down at the Bijou.

198
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:36,375
Yeah, things sure
have changed
since the '50s.

199
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,043
I don't care.

200
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:42,005
You know,
it's been a long time
since I performed live.

201
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,508
You'll do fine.
Just remember,

202
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,802
there'll be millions
of people watching you.

203
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,807
Millions!

204
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:57,145
And TV Guide's
Cheers and Jeers editor.

205
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,440
And he's already
given out all his cheers.

206
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,778
Live from
the corner of Zany Avenue

207
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,071
and Martin Luther King
Boulevard,

208
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,614
it's The Krusty
the Klown Show,

209
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,199
with special guest
Buck McCoy.

210
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:11,577
And now, here's Krusty!

211
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,829
We've got such
a great show tonight.

212
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,415
I won't be doing a monologue
because my feet hurt.

213
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,417
And now our opening sketch.

214
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:26,008
We don't take kindly
to transvestite chimpanzees
here in Pine Corners!

215
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,803
No one can save you now!

216
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:36,977
I said, no one
can save you now!

217
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,396
Shut up! I'm coming!

218
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:45,235
Oh! Like you're so perfect
with your plastic mane

219
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,865
and your painted-on spot.
What's real on you? Nothing!

220
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,450
He's drunk!

221
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,035
I've seen drunker.

222
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,163
Oh, right, yeah, the guns.

223
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,174
We're free!

224
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,142
These hilarious
health professionals

225
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,520
will cut me out
of my clothes
after this commercial.

226
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,231
What happened, Buck?

227
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,276
Did I forget to mention
I'm an alcoholic?

228
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,909
For shame.

229
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:41,249
This is horrible.
My spit-takes all
have blood in them.

230
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,418
Look, I'm really sorry.

231
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:47,255
Sorry don't suture
my colon! And you're
off my show forever!

232
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:59,434
Bart, I couldn't
help noticing Buck
is a total fraud,

233
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,271
so I took
the liberty of creating
a new hero for your wall.

234
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,441
That is just grotesque.

235
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,319
I thought if you were
looking to worship someone,

236
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,113
maybe it could
be your old man.

237
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,948
Eh. We could try it.

238
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,408
Yes!

239
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,038
My son lost his hero.

240
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,708
This should be
the greatest night
of my life.

241
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,042
How come I'm not happy?

242
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,752
You care about
Bart's feelings.

243
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:26,878
Stop saying that!

244
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,589
I think we should
try to restore
Bart's faith in Buck,

245
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,050
and we could start
by getting Buck
to quit drinking.

246
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:43,770
I'm sorry I let your son down,
but I'm too old to change.

247
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,564
Oh, listen to you!

248
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,233
"I'm too old to change. "

249
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,569
How old are you?

250
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:51,778
Seventy-six.

251
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:55,365
Nice old man.
Don't break a hip.

252
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,410
Have we gotten
all the liquor?

253
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,079
That painting is
made of liquor.

254
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,421
I was drinking so much
I forgot what life was about.

255
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:13,842
Gold! Gold!
Beautiful gold!

256
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,261
Nuggets as big
as your fists!

257
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,681
You guys are sick.
I don't belong here.

258
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:24,102
Buck, if you walk out
that door, you'll be
branded a quitter forever.

259
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,816
Mmm!

260
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:32,110
Something smells delicious!

261
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,613
Well, that's it.
This place ain't for me.

262
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:38,450
Well, we're not giving up.
We're going to
cure you of drinking.

263
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:43,079
Look, I worked long
and hard, got rich,
and now I'm retired.

264
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,665
Why shouldn't I be
able to drink all I want?

265
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,251
Well, I don't know.
I just naturally

266
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,462
assumed it was
some of my business.

267
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:54,007
Well, I don't see how
it is. Nobody's even
told me your name yet.

268
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,969
I'm still not
giving up on Buck.

269
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:01,556
There must be
some harebrained,
half-assed way...

270
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,641
This just in.

271
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:06,478
A robbery is in progress
at the National Bank
of Springfield.

272
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:10,524
The robbers are equipped
with the latest in high-tech
weaponry and body armor.

273
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,609
Stay back, coppers!

274
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,073
Uh, please, everyone!
Stay away!

275
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:22,911
We don't want
anyone to be a hero!
A hero! A hero!

276
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,164
Get me Buck McCoy!

277
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,874
Dad, I'm on the line!

278
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:32,295
Here you go.
Just stop this bank robbery
and you'll be a hero again.

279
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:36,007
I'll wait in the car.
Are you crazy?
I'm a movie cowboy.

280
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,301
And you're no Howard Hawks.

281
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,511
That hurts.

282
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,513
But I just have
one question.

283
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,516
Do you want my son
to be disappointed
in you?

284
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,310
Fine.

285
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,232
You don't need that.

286
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,486
Way to go, Buck.
I feel my faith
growing anew!

287
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,697
Better get rid of this, too.

288
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,408
Not to mention this.

289
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:05,287
Whoa! There's nothing wrong
with a little "hey-hey!"

290
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:12,460
Fun's over, boys!
Drop the hardware
and mosey!

291
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:18,675
I'm firing at the lasso,
but the bullets just
go through the middle!

292
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,385
It's the ultimate weapon.

293
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,192
Wow. That sure
made us look bad.

294
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,403
Slink away, boys.
Slink away.

295
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,117
Buck, you're
my hero again.

296
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,077
Aren't you
forgetting someone?

297
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:51,082
Well, there's Krusty,
Itchy, Scratchy, Poochie,
America's Fire Fighters,

298
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,250
and then you, Dad.

299
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,087
And don't you forget it.

300
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,839
Oh!

301
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:02,093
Goodbye, Bart!
Never bother me again!

302
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:34,436
