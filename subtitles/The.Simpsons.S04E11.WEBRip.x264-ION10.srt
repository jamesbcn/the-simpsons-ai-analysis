-Mm, okay.

You're right.

00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,265

54
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:13,145
a thousand knives of fire are
stabbing you in the heart?

55
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,204
I got that right now.

Ooh, bacon!

57
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,582
Homer, I prepared
a special surprise just for you.

58
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:24,078
It could only be one thing.

59
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,582
Psst! The best meat's
in the rump.

00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,075

Ooh, oatmeal.

What a delightful treat.

65
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,215
Oh, there's a bug in it.

00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,971
No, there isn't.

Trust me.

68
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,439
Dad, there's a bug on that.

69
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,348
Eh.

00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,895

73
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,497

(horn honking)

77
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,718
I keep hearing this horrible,
irregular thumping noise.

78
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,182
(thumping continues)

79
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,852
It's your heart,

80
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,720
and I think
it's on its last thump.

81
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,977
Whew! I was afraid
it was my transmission.

82
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,480
Hey, where's he going?

83
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,481
Billy, remember
that old Plymouth

84
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,193
we just couldn't fix?

85
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,154
We're going to sell him
to Mr. Nikapopolos?

86
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,105
You're a dull boy, Billy.

87
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:45,874
Look at that pig stuffing his
face with doughnuts on my time.

88
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,752
That's right. Keep eating.

89
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,500
Little do you know

90
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,711
you're drawing ever closer
to the poisoned doughnut.

91
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,462
(chuckling)

92
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,134
There is a poisoned one,
isn't there, Smithers?

93
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,923
Uh, no, sir. I discussed this
with our lawyers.

94
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,047
They consider it murder.

95
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,393
Damn their oily hides!

96
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,718

97
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,604

99
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,595

100
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,897
I just brought you in
for a friendly hello.

101
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,864
And good-bye!
You're fired!

102
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,324
-(groans)
-But wait.

103
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,454
Perhaps I'm being too hasty.

104
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,701
-You are highly skilled--
-(exhales)

105
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,914
-...at goofing off!
-(groans)

106
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,365
Now, don't worry, Homer.

107
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,076
You're the kind of guy
I could really dig...

108
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,707
a grave for!

109
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:40,723
Your indolence is inefficacious.

110
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,128
That means you're terrible!

111
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,016
Eh?

112
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,101
Mr. Burns, I think he's dead.

113
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,517
Oh, dear.

114
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,315
Send a ham to his widow.

115
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,108
Mmm... Ham.

116
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,993
No, wait. He's alive.

117
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,702
-Oh, good. Cancel the ham.
-D'oh!

118
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,033

it's not going to work.

See?

124
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,967
He was taking a bite
and his jaw locked.

125

Well, we can't fix

175
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,978

-Good Lord.
-Hi.

179
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,120

00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,540
I start you jiggling

181
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,248
and measure how long
it takes to stop.

182
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,629
Whoo-hoo!
Look at that blubber fly.

183
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,750
Yes.

184
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,967
Nurse, cancel my 1:00.

185
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,048
Homer, I'm afraid you'll
have to undergo

186
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,183
a coronary bypass
operation.

187
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,761
Say it in English, Doc.

188
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,675
You're going to need
open-heart surgery.

189
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,684
Spare me your medical
mumbo-jumbo.

190
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:22,346
We're going to cut you open
and tinker with your ticker.

191
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,396
Could you dumb it
down a shade?

192
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,610
Doctor, we'll do whatever it
takes to get my Homie well.

193
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,991
Good. I must warn you, though.

194
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:33,238
This procedure will cost you
upwards of $30,000.

195
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,122
(Homer gasping and choking)

196
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,119
(body thuds)

197
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,161
DR. HIBBERT:
I'm afraid it's now 40,000.

198
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,594
Okay, okay,
we need $40,000.

199
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,920
Now how much do we have
in the checkbook?

200
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,716
-$70.
-Hmm...

201
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,850
Have we deposited any $40,000
checks that haven't cleared yet?

202
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,428
No. Don't you have
health insurance at work?

203
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,974
Well, actually,
we gave it all up

204
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,727
for a pinball machine
in the lounge.

205
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,349
-D'oh!
-Don't worry, Marge.

206
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,227
America's health care system
is second only to Japan...

207
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,315
Canada, Sweden, Great Britain...

208
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,691
Well, all of Europe.

209
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,487
But you can thank
your lucky stars

210
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,281
we don't live in Paraguay.

211
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,655
(sobbing)

212
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,496
Now before we give you
health insurance,

213
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,594
I have to ask you
a few questions.

214
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,499
Questions? Questions?

215
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,628
Oh, my whole scheme
down the...

216
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,085
I mean, ask away.

217
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,255
Good.

218
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,893
Now, under "heart attacks,"

219
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,099
you crossed out "3"
and wrote "0."

220
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,680
I thought that said
brain hemorrhages.

221
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,597
Oh. And do you drink?

222
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,936
I do enjoy a snifter
of port at Christmas.

223
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,022
All right, here's your policy.

224
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,737
Now let me tell you something,
Mr. Sucker, I just...

225
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,488
Hold on there.
You still have to sign it.

226
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,491
Oh. I...

227
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,663
(gasping)

228
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,411
Must... sign... policy.

229
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,624
Sir, I'm sorry.
We can't insure you.

230
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,964
-I made an "H."
-No, that doesn't count.

231
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,330
Looks like an "X."

232
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,996
We better get you
to a hospital.

233
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,706
-Can I have a free calendar?
-Okay.

234
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,917
Clear.

235
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,177
Oh, doctor,

236
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,838
I was in a wonderful place

237
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,927
filled with fire and brimstone.

238
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,772
And there were all these
guys in red pajamas

239
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,728
sticking pitchforks
in my butt.

240
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,899
Mr. Simpson, you must get that
operation as soon as possible.

241
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,858
I can't afford it.

242
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,689
Maybe I should buy
one of those machines.

243
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,945
Oh, yeah. That's the stuff.

244
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,778
Now, I know I haven't been
the best Christian.

245
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,994
In fact, when you're up there
blah-blah-blahing,

246
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,365
I'm usually doodling

247
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,701
or mentally undressing
the female parishioners.

248
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:48,867
Well, anywho,
can I have $40,000?

249
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,668
Now, I know I haven't been
the best Jew,

250
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,302
but I rented
<i>Fiddler on the Roof</i>

251
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,879
and I will watch it.

252
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,384
-Anyway, can I have $40,000?
-Mmm?

253
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,006
Now, I know
I haven't been the best...

254
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,604
Aw, forget it.

255
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,220
Honey, did you have any luck?

256
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,636
No, but the rabbi
gave me this.

257
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,886
What is it, Dad?

258
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,057
Son, they call it a droodle.

259
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,396
Whoo-hoo!
Look at him go.

260
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:16,031
<i>Hi, everybody.</i>
<i>Are you looking for a way</i>

261
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,610
<i>to slash the cost</i>
<i>of your medical expenses?</i>

262
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,486
Boring.

263
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,243
Wait, this might be the answer
we're looking for.

264
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:27,464
<i>I will perform any operation</i>
<i>for $129.95.</i>

265
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,368

00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,246
<i>Okay, Fred.</i>

269
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,667
<i>You tried the best.</i>

270
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,466
<i>Now try the rest.</i>

271
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,719
{\an8}<i>Call 1-600-DOCTORB.</i>

272
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,602
{\an8}<i>The "B" is for "Bargain."</i>

273
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,934
Marge, we could do worse.

274
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,476
How?

275
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,189
Some dog could do
the operation.

276
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,400
Operation?
What are you talking about?

277
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,401
Kids, I have something
to tell you.

278
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,363
Oh, Homie, I don't know.
This might upset them.

279
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,204
Nothing you say can upset us.

280
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,489
We're the MTV generation.

281
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,532
We feel neither
highs nor lows.

282
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,656
-Really? What's it like?
-Eh.

283
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,413
Well, you kids are old enough
to know the truth,

284
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,116
and I'm not gonna
sugarcoat it.

285
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,626
So, the tiny aorta fairies
will take Mr. Leg Vein

286
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,999
on a long trip to get married

287
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,126
to Princess Left Ventricle.

288
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,674
Dad, are you trying
to tell us

289
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,127
you're getting
a coronary artery bypass graft?

290
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,298
Uh, yeah.

291
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,885
Oh, no. What if they botch it?

292
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,391
I won't have a dad...

293
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,854
for a while.

294
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,854
(sobbing)

295
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,146
Kids, kids,
I'm not going to die.

296
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,401
That only happens
to bad people.

297
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,153
What about
Abraham Lincoln?

298
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,065
Uh, he sold poisoned milk
to schoolchildren.

299
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,534
-Homer!
-Hey, I'm just trying

300
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,034
to make it easier on 'em.

301
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,075
HOMER:
Bed goes up, bed goes down.

302
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,909
Bed goes up, bed goes down.

303
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,124
Bed goes up,
bed goes down.

304
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,365
Bed goes up, bed goes down.

305
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,876
FLANDERS:
Homer Simpson?

306
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,669
If that don't put the "Dink"
In co-inky-dink.

307
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,843
Flanders,
what are you doing here?

308
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,172
I'm having a kidney
and a lung removed.

309
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,838
Who are you donating them to?

310
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,176
First come, first serve.

311
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,181
What are you in for?

312
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,812
I got a bad heart.

313
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,308
If I could give you
my heart, Homer, I would.

314
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,351
Shut up, Flanders.

315
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,479
Hi, everybody!

316
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,192
I'm Dr. Nick Riviera.

317
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,233
<i>Dr. Riviera,</i>
<i>Dr. Nick Riviera,</i>

318
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,816
<i>please report</i>
<i>to the coroner immediately.</i>

319
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,651
The coroner?
I'm so sick of that guy.

320
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,777
Well, see you
in the operating place.

321
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,656
-Dr. Riviera!
-Dr. Riviera!

322
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:29,742
Where are the bodies?

323
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,827
Oh, such a nice day.

324
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,582
I think I'll go out the window.

325
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,794
Whoa!

326
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,634
(crashing)

327
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,379
Dear Lord, thank you
for Ziggy comics,

328
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,465
little baby ducks,

329
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,181
and <i>Sweatin' to the Oldies,</i>
volumes one, two, and four.

330
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,387
Dear Lord,

331
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,345
I'm really scared
about this operation tomorrow.

332
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,437
If something happens,
please look after Marge

333
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,193
and make sure
my kids grow up right.

334
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,276
Shh!

335
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,237
Sorry.

336
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:15,329
...and that's why God
causes train wrecks.

337
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,458
My dad is very sick.

338
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,422
What's going to happen
if he dies?

339
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,342
Well, if he's been good,
he'll go to heaven.

340
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,842
In heaven, you get to do

341
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,804
whatever you like best
all the time.

342
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,005
Cloud goes up,
cloud goes down.

343
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,716
Cloud goes up,
cloud goes down.

344
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,056
Bed goes up, bed goes down.

345
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,602
Hey! Hey!

346
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,095
(maniacal laughter)

347
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,477
(gasping)

348
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,733
Hey, what's the matter?

349
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,324
Oh, that's right.

350
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,279
My grotesque appearance.

351
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,860
(laughing)

352
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,275
Krusty,
why are you here?

353
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,743
It's part of my public service

354
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:53,373
for my glug-glug,
vroom-vroom, thump-thump.

355
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,702
Oh, well,
I could use a good laugh.

356
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,998
Well, there's nothing funny about
what you're about to go through.

357
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,633
I know.
I'm in the zipper club myself.

358
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:03,711
(takes long drag)

359
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,876
-You seem okay.
-Yeah?

360
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,137
Well, I got news for you.
This ain't makeup.

361
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,760
They say the greatest tragedy

362
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,807
is when a father outlives
his son.

363
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,902
I've never fully understood
why that is.

364
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,569
Frankly, I can see
an upside to it.

365
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,109
{\an8}We passed this card
around at work.

366
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,903
Gee, thanks, guys.

367
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,567
They had a hell of a time
replacing you.

368
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,115
When I first heard
about the operation,

369
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,082
I was against it.

370
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,662
But then I thought

371
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,877
"If Homer wants to be a woman,
so be it."

372
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,209
Barney, I'm not getting
a sex change.

373
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,884
What?!

374
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,223
What the hell
am I supposed to do

375
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,048
with this jumbo thong bikini?

376
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:53,394
Homer, I snuck you in a beer
for old times' sake.

377
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,850
Thanks, Moe.

378
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,141
Uh, you know, Homer,
that beer ain't free.

379
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,976
Mom, this is fascinating.

380
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:06,363
Did you know that they'll stop
Dad's heart for six whole minutes?

381
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,862
I don't know
if I like you reading

382
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,494
all those cardiology books.

383
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,321
No, Mom,
it's very reassuring,

384
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,366
and I 've learned
a great deal

385
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,620
from this cow's heart I got
at the butcher shop.

386
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,203
(groaning)

387
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,208
MAN:
<i>Insert the retractor</i>

388
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,380
<i>and crank it</i>
<i>until the ribs swing open</i>

389
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,129
<i>like a rusty drawbridge.</i>

390
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,340
Ohh, no!

391
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,960
Blood! Ugh!

392
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,667
<i>Next, make an incision</i>
<i>in the coronary art...</i>

393
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:34,928
<i>And we are back with more of</i>
People Who Look Like Things.

394
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,392
<i>(applause)</i>

395
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,941
Oh, no! No!

396
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,651
Someone taped over
the end of this.

397
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,152
<i>All we ask is to be treated</i>
<i>with dignity and respect.</i>

398
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,065
<i>And a new candle</i>
<i>now and then?</i>

399
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,204
<i>Yes, and a new... No!</i>

400
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,910
(audience laughing)

401
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,660
Oh, my little Maggie.

402
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,873
I may never hold you again.

403
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,293
Eww! Stinky pants.

404
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,632
Now, Marge,
if the unthinkable

405
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,418
should happen,
you're going to be lonely.

406
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,672
Homie, I could never re-marry.

407
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,674
Darn right.

408
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,125
And to make sure

409
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,795
I want to be stuffed
and put on the couch

410
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,763
as a constant reminder
of our marital vows.

411
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,104
Kids, you can come in now.

412
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,179
Bed goes up.

413
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,387
Kids, I wanna give you some
words to remember me by

414
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,058
in case something happens.

415
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,106
Let's see.

416
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,769
Uh...

417
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,149
Oh, I'm no good at this.

418
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,646
(whispering)

419
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,657
Bart, the saddest thing
about this is

420
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,040
I won't get to see
you grow up because...

421
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,249
I know you're going
to turn out great

422
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,619
with or without your old man.

423
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:45,866
Thanks, Dad.

424
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,168
And, Lisa...

425
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,300
I guess this is
the time to tell you...

426
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,263
you're adopted,
and I don't like you.

427
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,973
Bart!

428
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,354
But don't worry,
because you've got

429
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,020
a big brother
who loves you

430
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,139
and will always
look out for you.

431
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,265
Oh, Dad.

432
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,146
Hi, everybody.

433
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,533
ALL:
Hi, Dr. Nick!

434
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,279
(snoring)

435
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,411
Now, if something
should go wrong,

436
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,818
let's not get
the law involved.

437
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,407
One hand washes the other.

438
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,123
Ooh, that reminds me.

439
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,668
These gloves came free
with my toilet brush.

440
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,338
What the hell is that?

441
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,471
Marge, this is Andre.

442
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,927
Hello.

443
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,897
I think you two would make
a lovely couple.

444
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,358
My husband is still alive.

445
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,939
Oh. Thank God.

446
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,284
I hope he pulls through.

447
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,438
Not me.
(chuckles)

448
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,357
Let's have a minute
of silent prayer

449
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,697
for our good friend,
Homer Simpson.

450
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:07,998
How long has it been?

451
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,081
Six seconds.

452
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,666
Do we have to start over?

453
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,881
Hell, no.

454
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,670
Poor Mr. Homer.

455
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,554
Could it be that my snack treats
are responsible

456
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,632
for his wretched health?

457
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,086
Give me some jerky.

458
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,256
Would you like
some vodka with that?

459
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,394
Oh, what the hell.
Sure.

460
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,852
Doctor, what's wrong?

461
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,806
Don't you know
where to make the incision?

462
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,687
All right, Nick,
don't panic.

463
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,864
Think back to med school.

464
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,446
Seriously, baby.

465
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,989
I can prescribe
anything I want.

466
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,869
I know I'm supposed
to cut something,

467
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,543
but what and where?

468
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,251
Hey!

469
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:54,922
The incision in the coronary artery
must be made below the blockage!

470
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,423
Below!

471
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,755
