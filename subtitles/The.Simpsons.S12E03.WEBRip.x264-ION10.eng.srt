(honking horn)

11
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,524
D'oh!

00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,821

00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,583
{\an8}(laughs)

15
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,747
{\an8}This watermelon won't know what hit it.

16
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,166
{\an8}I love our Tuesdays together, Dad.

17
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,260
{\an8}(laughter)

18
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,965
{\an8}Don't you two have a list of chores to do?

19
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,636
{\an8}Hey, we just took care of that
dangerous melon

20
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,104
{\an8}that was threatening our garden.

21
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,644
{\an8}Yeah, we're heroes.

22
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,557
{\an8}But where's our parade?

23
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,016
{\an8}(groans)

24
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,396
{\an8}HOMER: All right. "Open stuck drawer."

25
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,493
{\an8}All righty. (grunting)

26
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,947
{\an8}-It's hopeless.
-Or is it?

27
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,410
{\an8}Yeah, it's hopeless.

28
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,950
{\an8}I said, "Or is it?"

29
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:01,204
{\an8}I said, "It's..." Oh.

30
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,288
{\an8}(laughs)

31
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,963
{\an8}Homer, what are you doing?

32
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,631
{\an8}Listen, do you want the job done right

33
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,089
{\an8}or do you want it done fast?

34
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,799
{\an8}Well, like all Americans, fast, but...

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,970
Clear!

36
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,514
You can't argue with results.

37
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,388
BART: Ooh, baby!

38
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,437
{\an8}(laughs)

39
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,150
{\an8}-(whimpering)
-Oh, don't worry.

40
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,781
{\an8}You'll be sleeping in this
beautiful new doghouse.

41
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,149
{\an8}Target date, January 2007.

42
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,070
{\an8}(whimpering)

43
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,488
{\an8}And now, the grand finale.

44
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,327
{\an8}"Get Lisa's jammed tape out of VCR."

45
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,037
{\an8}Wait--wait a minute.

46
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,424
{\an8}There.

47
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,590
{\an8}Fire in the hole!

48
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,717
{\an8}It's going to take a lot of fireworks

49
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,088
{\an8}to clean this place up.

50
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,255
{\an8}(gasps) What's going on here?

51
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,762
{\an8}Uh, honey...

52
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,016
{\an8}there's a point in every father's life

53
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,928
{\an8}when he blows up his daughter's room.

54
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,347
{\an8}Oh, yeah? You didn't blow up
Maggie's room.

55
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,976
{\an8}(explosion)

56
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,572
{\an8}Oh, Lisa, this must be
a rough time for you.

57
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,358
{\an8}Do you have any friends
or family you can stay with?

58
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,323
{\an8}You've ruined all my stuff.

59
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,913
{\an8}Oh, come on. Tell us how we can
make it up to you.

60
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,989
Hey, pretend it's your birthday!

61
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,454
It is my birthday.

62
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,494
That's the spirit. Now, what do
you want to do?

63
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,498
{\an8}Well, the book festival starts today...

64
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,540
{\an8}Anything at all. You name it.

65
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,254
{\an8}What do you want to do?

66
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,291
HOMER: Stupid Lisa.

67
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,132
Hear ye, hear ye!

68
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,136
One dollar off on all poetry books!

69
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,389
(crowd clamoring)

70
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:44,023
(sobs) Their hands were everywhere.

71
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,429
REVEREND LOVEJOY: Hello, Simpsons.

72
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,687
Care to try a sample
from my new cookbook--

73
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,940
<i>Someone's in the Kitchen with Jesus?</i>

74
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,190
Mm, these stigmuffins are to die for!

75
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,697
Oh, if you like that, you should try

76
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,159
Mary Magdalene's chocolate orgasm.

77
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,570
Ooh, OK.

78
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,908
{\an8}-(squirts)
-(grunts)

79
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,286
{\an8}So, Mr. King, what tale of horror

80
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,424
{\an8}and the macabre are you working on now?

81
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,591
{\an8}Oh, I don't feel like
writing horror right now.

82
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,300
Oh, that's too bad.

83
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,970
I'm working on a biography
of Benjamin Franklin.

84
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,129
He's a fascinating man.

85
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,507
He discovered electricity

86
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,393
and used it to torture small animals

87
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,890
and Green Mountain men.

88
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,812
And that key he tied to the end of a kite?

89
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,980
(thunder crashing)

90
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,018
It opened <i>The Gates of Hell!</i>

91
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,860
Well, let me know when
you get back to horror.

92
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,069
Will do.

93
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,153
Hi. With my Info Cram 6000,

94
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,988
you can absorb books instantly

95
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,873
by attaching this electrode
to the brain pan

96
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,201
and this one to the loi-ns.

97
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,328
(electricity crackling)

98
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,754
Tolstoy... Searing... Brain...

99
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,213
With my diet you can eat all you want

100
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,804
any time you want.

101
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,258
And you lose weight?

102
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,338
Uh, you might. It's a free country.

103
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,926
Finally, books for today's busy idiot.

104
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,774
<i>Network Programming for Dummies.</i>

105
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,179
<i>Christianity for Dummies.</i>

106
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,807
Mo-- <i>Moby Dick?</i>

107
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,023
"Call me Ishmael, dummy."

108
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,734
How did you write all these books?

109
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,444
Uh, I don't know.

110
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,744
Me got to go to bank now.

111
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:23,867
{\an8}Look, Maggie. Christopher Walken's
reading <i>Goodnight, Moon.</i>

112
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,578
{\an8}"Good night, room.

113
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,578
{\an8}Good night, moon.

114
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,460
{\an8}Good night, cow jumping over the moon."

115
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,418
(children whimpering)

116
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,918
Please, children, scootch closer.

117
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,801
Don't make me tell you again
about the scootching.

118
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,759
You in the red, chop-chop.

119
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,509
-(children whimpering)
-Hmm.

120
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:48,217
(laughs) Eh.

121
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,516
All right, does anyone
have a question for our panel

122
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
that's not about how much money they make?

123
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,265
Uh, yeah. I'm a techno-thriller junkie,
and I'd like to know,

124
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,896
is the B-2 Bomber more
detectable when it rains?

125
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,573
{\an8}-Oh-ho. What do you think, Tom Clancy?
-Well, the B-2...

126
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,492
{\an8}No, no, I was asking Maya Angelou.

127
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,657
{\an8}The ebony fighter awakens

128
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,911
{\an8}dappled with the dewy beads of morn.

129
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,503
{\an8}Maya Angelou is black?

130
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,368
{\an8}It is a Mach 5 child

131
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,165
forever bound to suckle

132
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,418
from the shriveled breast of Congress.

133
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,501
Oh, Maya, you're a national treasure.

134
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,166
(mic feedback sound)

135
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,415
Ms. Tan, I loved <i>The Joy Luck Club.</i>

136
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,428
It really showed me
how the mother-daughter bond

137
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,890
could triumph over adversity.

138
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,889
{\an8}No, that's not what I meant at all.

139
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,431
{\an8}You couldn't have gotten it more wrong.

140
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,595
{\an8}-But...
-Please, just sit down.

141
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,943
{\an8}I'm embarrassed for both of us.

142
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,146
(moans softly)

143
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,520
(gasps)

144
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,976
Ew!

145
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,452
(laughs) Book writing.

146
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,571
What a scam, huh?

147
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,527
It's only 20 pages long.

148
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,117
And this guy wrote it for me.

149
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,162
-What's your name again?
-John Updike.

150
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,536
Whoa, whoa! I didn't ask
for your life story.

151
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,043
So, you really know Krusty?

152
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,376
What's he like?

153
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,000
Oh, he's wonderful.

154
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,257
He would do anything for his fans.

155
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,259
KRUSTY: Hurry up, kid.

156
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,298
-Name?
-Hey, it's me, Bart.

157
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,603
-Your biggest fan.
-Hey, good for you, 'cause I wanna...

158
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,102
know that all my fans
are all... (mumbling)

159
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,690
{\an8}"K the C"?

160
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,900
Hey, this pen's got to last me all day.

161
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,361
Now, if you could
up, bup, bup, bup, bup! Yeah.

162
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,939
-Name?
-My name is Sophie.

163
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,357
Hey, good luck with that.

164
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,406
I'm your daughter.

165
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,868
What?

166
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,078
I finally found my daddy.

167
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,449
Ohh... I think I just seltzered myself.

168
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,617
-(laughs)
-Shut up, Updike!

169
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,502
Listen, honey, a lot of kids

170
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,007
think of me as their daddy,

171
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,838
but I'm just a simple TV legend.

172
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,514
Here, have a keychain.

173
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,303
No, I'm sure you're my father.

174
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,176
You met my mom during the Gulf War.

175
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,973
Oh. Was your mother
an Israeli flight attendant?

176
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,637
-No.
-Cokie Roberts?

177
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,226
No, she was a soldier.

178
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,731
Chestnut brown hair, kind of shy,

179
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,443
thirty-two confirmed kills.

180
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:06,113
Oh-ho-ho! Oh, boy...
Now it's coming back to me.

181
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,820
{\an8}-(applause)
-(drum roll)

182
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,366
Saddam Hussein?

183
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,449
They should call him
"so damn insane." Ha ha--

184
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,575
Hey, you're just fanning
the flames of hatred.

185
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,333
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

186
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,835
Now, just when you thought
the desert couldn't get any hotter,

187
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,419
it's the Cincinnati Bengal cheerleaders!

188
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,426
Hey, I can't look at that.
I have a girlfriend back home.

189
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,549
This is an insult to our Muslim hosts.

190
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:35,096
KRUSTY: <i>During the show,</i>
<i>a desert wind kicked up.</i>

191
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,271
(wind whooshing)

192
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,734
<i>I sought shelter in a nearby tent.</i>

193
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,311
(gasps)

194
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,107
<i>There was your mother</i>

195
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,111
<i>looking like a beautiful mirage.</i>

196
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,744
<i>Maybe it was the anthrax in the air.</i>

197
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,121
<i>Maybe it was the fact</i>
<i>the Arab women weren't biting.</i>

198
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:57,119
<i>Whatever it was, it was magic.</i>

199
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,294
<i>We slept late</i>
<i>into the morning, and then...</i>

200
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,458
My God, I'm late for my mission!

201
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,377
Here's your mission--
get down with the clown!

202
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,386
-Oh, come on, baby.
-No, not now!

203
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,178
I'm supposed to assassinate Saddam.

204
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,262
Wait a minute, you can't kill Saddam.

205
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,767
He's half my act!

206
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,650
Oh, stop.

207
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,943
No!

208
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,412
(crowd whining)

209
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,124
I just saved my baseball bit.

210
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:46,285
Who's Sayin's on first,
Iya Tol'ya's on second, and...

211
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,457
-You stupid clown!
-(grunting)

212
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,549
When I came to, she was gone

213
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,592
and the war had been over
for eight months.

214
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,546
Anyway, how'd you finally find me?

215
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,386
All my mom ever said was my father was
some pathetic clown.

216
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,892
So, I typed "pathetic clown"
into a search engine

217
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,305
and your name popped right up.

218
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,773
-(car horn honks)
-It's Mom.

219
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,324
Hey, how you been? Remember me?

220
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,648
(engine revs up)

221
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,863
Uh... You better get going.

222
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,823
It was nice meeting you.
Thanks for coming out.

223
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:16,703
But I was hoping maybe
we could do some stuff together

224
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,662
like go to the beach and junk.

225
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,543
Look, you're a sweet kid,

226
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,000
but I'm not exactly father material.

227
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,870
I curse, I gamble,

228
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,877
I pick fights with homeless people,

229
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,129
I... What's wrong with your eyes?

230
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,671
You need a Claritin or something?

231
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,756
Oh, all right.

232
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:37,051
You get one trip to the beach,
with my assistant.

233
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,796
-(sighs)
-OK, I'll take you.

234
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,308
Yay!

235
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,599
Dear Lord, bless this humble meal.

236
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,564
And did you hear about Krusty?

237
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,185
Whoo, man.

238
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,191
I mean, I knew he was a player,
but, geez, a kid?

239
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,324
Homer, that's not a prayer. That's gossip.

240
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,201
Fine, I'll just discuss heavenly matters.

241
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,069
So, how's Maude Flanders doing up there?

242
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,276
Is she playing the field?

243
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,276
Ooh, yeah, really?

244
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,578
All those guys?

245
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,250
-Amen.
-(Marge groans)

246
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,752
(humming)

247
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,762
OK, kid, there's the water.

248
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,893
-Knock yourself out.
-Come on, Dad.

249
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,100
Let's go bodysurfing or boogie boarding.

250
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,391
Listen, kid, I'm not the kind of dad

251
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,845
who, you know, does things

252
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,845
or says stuff, or looks at you.

253
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,807
But the love is there.

254
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,897
Where are you? Give Daddy a clue.

255
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,822
Oh, that's my girl.

256
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,532
OK, you just sit there

257
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,492
and I'll throw the Frisbee to you.

258
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,622
Oh, I got to sit up now?

259
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,041
Oh! What am I, Baryshnikov?

260
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,500
Oh! (laughs)

261
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,120
Hey, you beat me.

262
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,497
What a great day we've had, huh?

263
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,254
You know... for a clown,

264
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,166
you're not really a lot of fun.

265
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,255
(Krusty groans)

266
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,549
(Sophie sighs)

267
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,798
Boy, fatherhood is one tough gig.

268
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,885
I don't get how other guys do it.

269
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,140
Ready? Switch!

270
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,225
(kids giggling)

271
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,639
Hey, careful, boys.

272
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,808
That arch is looking a little Romanesque.

273
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,936
Sorry, Daddy. How should I punish myself?

274
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,446
No, son. You let them finish,
then you smash it.

275
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,528
That's a good boy.

276
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,112
Mush, Homer, mush!

277
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,617
-Catch, Dad! Catch!
-Oh!

278
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,160
OK, that stings Daddy's eyes, honey.

279
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,914
Hmm, I think I found my mentor.

280
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,078
-Heads up!
-KRUSTY: You know, Homer,

281
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,627
I've spent my whole life entertaining kids

282
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,051
and I just realized
I don't know the first thing about them.

283
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:40,721
Well, I won't lie. Fatherhood isn't easy,
like motherhood,

284
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,431
but I wouldn't trade it for anything...

285
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,102
except for some mag wheels.

286
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,271
Oh, man, that would be sweet.

287
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,229
LISA: Dad! Dad!

288
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,610
Just a second, honey,
Daddy's on his high horse.

289
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,318
Dad!

290
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,108
Yeah, I'm watching, honey.

291
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,782
Nice cannonball.

292
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,240
Anywho, the key to fathering
is don't overthink

293
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,992
'cause overthinking is, um...

294
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,454
What were we talking about?

295
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,454

you're starting to grow on me.

309
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,736
Same here, Dad.

310
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,950
It's nice that you don't
always have to be on.

311
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,660
I thought I was on! When was I off?

312
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,491
That bit about the tide pool?

313
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,446
I tell you, it killed at
Jacques Cousteau's funeral.

314
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,788
Dad, relax.

315
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,672
Just enjoy the sunset.

316
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,379
(plays solemn classical music)

317
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,300
Hey, I know that song.

318
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,549
My dad used to play that when I was a boy.

319
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:05,182
-(sniffles) It's beautiful.
-Do you play?

320
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,391
No, I guess musical talent
skips a generation,

321
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,022
like diabetes.

322
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,889
You might want to watch out for that, too.

323
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,476
SOPHIE: Mom, I had the best time!

324
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,692
Can Dad come in for milk and cookies?

325
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,322
Why, I'd love to... Whoa!

326
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,069

328
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,066
Oskar Homolka! (nervous chuckle)

329
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,275
That's OK. I think I'll go
somewhere friendlier

330
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,827
like beautiful Downtown Grozny!
Ha ha ha!

331
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:32,912
Zoom.

332
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,790
My little girl's sharp as a tack.

333
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,956
I tried the "Got your nose" bit on her--

334
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,804
didn't fool her for a second.

335
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,920
My uncle still has my nose.

336
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,967
Hmm. (groans)

337
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,011
Oh... (squeals of delight)

338
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,175
Oh, what a lousy hand.

339
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,675
-I'll stand.
-I raise. Two G's.

340
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,437
-I'm out.
-Fold-a-rama.

341
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,059
Can we make this hand high-low?

342
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,476
-No.
-I fold.

343
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,614
Krusty, are you in, or are you out?

344
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,612
Oh, man, I'm totally tapped.

345
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,284
Would you consider taking my Rolex?

346
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,952
You mean, this one?

347
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,371
Oh, yeah, right.

348
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,949
Just let me go to my car.

00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,288
Hmm-mm.

352
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,626
Let's see, the sweater,

353
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,592
the custom floor mat...

354
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,592
the stereo!

355
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:29,054
-(alarm buzzing)
-<i>Theft alert. Deploy airbag.</i>

356
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,466
Ahh! (groans)

357
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,477
Best hand of my life, and I can't even--

358
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:38,518
Huh? Sophie's violin? Oh, no, I couldn't.

359
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:43,114

360
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,652

361
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,697
(groans)

362
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,990
Hmm.

363
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,623
(strumming)

364
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,287
(squeaking)

365
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,285
Well, it won't bring much cash,

366
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,042
but its sentimental value
is through the roof.

367
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,584
It is acceptable.

368
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,248
Then I'm in, and I call!

369
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,667
Four aces.

370
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,755
-Read them and--
-Straight flush.

371
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,603
Oh, no! No!

372
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,009
You can't!

373
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,847
My daughter will never forgive me!

374
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,352
(humming)

375
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,188
Oh, wait. Now I can do it for real.

376
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,232
(plays solemn classical music)

377
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,504
(plays snappy ending)

378
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,457
Hee!

379
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,129
(doorbell rings)

380
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,505
-Hey, hey, Dad.
-Hey, hey!

381
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,930
Now, look, Sophie.

382
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,549
I know you think your daddy's perfect...

383
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,045
-No, I don't.
-...but I did a bad thing.

384
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,218
I lost your violin in a poker game.

385
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,096
-You what?
-But don't worry.

386
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,143
I got you an even better one.

387
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,767
This is a ukulele.

388
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,234
Yeah, the thinking
man's violin. Check it out.

391
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,201
I want my violin.

392
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,489
But, honey, I... (stammering)

393
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,083
I can't believe you would
gamble with something

394
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,659
that meant so much to me.

395
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,294
Wait. Time out.

396
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,791
Four aces is not a gamble.

397
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,714
Mom was right.

398
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,752
I was better off not knowing you.

399
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,422
(sighs)

400
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,260
<i>Word on the street is you dumped Dawson.</i>

401
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,592
<i>He's history, Jenda.</i>

402
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,177
<i>Wait till he sees me</i>

403
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,933
(speaks in Spanish)

404
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,936
I'm all for ethnic diversity,
but this is just pandering.

405
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,649
Maybe so, but Dawson's going to be bummed.

406
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,560
(door opens)

407
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,477
You got to help me.
My daughter found out I'm a jerk.

408
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,237
Oh, Krusty, I'm sure she just
needs time to get used to you.

409
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,741
Marge, may I play
devil's advocate for a moment?

410
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,743
-Sure. Go ahead.
-(Homer grunting)

411
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,445
Come on, get in there!

412
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,195
-(buzzer sounding)
-D'oh!

413
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,617
Stupid game.

414
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,285
Now, what were we talking about?

415
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,793
-My daughter's violin.
-Oh, right.

416
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,626
Why don't we just break
into fat Tony's compound

417
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,961
and get it back?

418
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,916
Really? You'd help me take on the mob?

419
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:15,427
For a casual acquaintance
like you? Absolutely.

420
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,815
It's some kind of mafia summit.

421
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,401
Every mob family in the country's here.

422
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,357
The Cuomos, the Travoltas,

423
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,117
the Lasordas, the Boy-ar-dees...

424
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,410
This is perfect.

425
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,703
If I know fat Tony, which I don't,

426
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,287
he'll be distracted by his hosting duties.

427
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,873
-Come on.
-(thuds)

428
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,464
(chuckling)

429
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,626
Idiots.

430
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,175
(Homer whimpering)

431
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,430
Hey, I heard there's
a lunar eclipse tonight.

432
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,723
Maybe we should look up.

433
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,056
Nah. For me, it's solar or nothing.

434
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,392
(both sighing)

435
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,766
(grunts)

436
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,441
Welcome to my home.

437
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,153
To answer your first question,

438
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,283
yes, we do have pasta.

439
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,700
Hey, all right! I like pasta. That's good.

440
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,369
If you need money laundered,
just set it outside your door.

441
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,618
You can pick it up in the morning.

442
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,200
Whoa, hey!

443
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,235
Beautiful.

444
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,447
Now, some unpleasant news.

445
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:28,708
I have learned that someone
in this room is a squealer.

446
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,422
We've narrowed it down to either

447
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,752
Johnny Tightlips

448
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,257
or Frankie the Squealer.

449
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,218
OK, it's me. I can't help it.

450
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,589
I just like squealing.

451
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,085
It makes me feel big.

452
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,337
All right, come on, you're history.

453
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,683
That violin's got to be
around here somewhere.

454
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,637
(fists pounding)

455
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,858
-Had enough, Squealer?
-(spitting)

456
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,858
Did you know fat Tony's
real name is Marion?

457
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,530
You just don't get it, do you?

458
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,899
(fists pounding)

459
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,696
KRUSTY: Bingo!

460
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,248
-D'oh!
-D'oh!

461
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,289
Oh, it's going to take forever
to go through all these.

462
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,083
I have a plan.

463
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,048
Well, that didn't work.

464
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,418
LOUIE: Hey, legs,
let's go jump on Tony's bed.

465
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,085
-LOUIE: Sure. BOTH: Ahh. Uh-oh.

466
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,974
We got to get out of here.
Just take them all!

467
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,391
Then it's decided.

468
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,719
Our website name will be crime.org.

469
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,224
I think we're in the clear.

470
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,966
-(clears throat)
-(both gasp)

471
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,768
(machine guns firing)

472
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,481
(gunfire)

473
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,608
Homer, I've got it!

474
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,614
Johnny Tightlips, where'd they hit you?

475
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,776
-I ain't saying nothing.
-But what do I tell the doctor?

476
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,325
Tell him to suck a lemon.

477
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,698
(violin playing "Twinkle,
Twinkle Little Star")

478
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,537
(gasps excitedly)

479
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,999
(gasps loudly)

480
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,173
Hey!

481
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,627
You did it!

482
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,131
You got it back.

483
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,088
Thanks, Dad.

484
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,843
"Dad." That still sounds weird to me,

485
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,796
but I'm glad we're friends again.

486
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,296
(gasps)

487
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,888
And you've lined the case with money.

488
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,774
Small bills, unmarked and non-sequential.

489
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,141
Holy Simoleons!

490
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,358
There must be five grand in there...

491
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,608
oh, which I intentionally
put in there for you,

492
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:20,782
you... you lucky little <i>hamantashen.</i>

493
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:24,072
Come on, how about a tune for the old man?

494
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,156
(gunshots)

495
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,785
That's him, that's the one--
Homer Simpson!

496
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,212
-(guns firing)
-I said I was sorry.

497
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,882
-All right, fair enough.
-Oh, OK.

498
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,880
-Class act.
-Sorry--

499
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,251
you're such jerks!

500
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,377
