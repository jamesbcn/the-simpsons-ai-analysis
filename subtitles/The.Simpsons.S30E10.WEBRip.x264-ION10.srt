1
00:00:03,351 --> 00:00:05,309
Ho, ho, ho!

2
00:00:10,749 --> 00:00:12,751
Happy birthday.

3
00:00:38,908 --> 00:00:40,214
D'oh!

4
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,020
Merry Christmas!

5
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:27,174
Another Thanksgiving
is in the books.

6
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:29,524
Which means Christmas
is starting.

7
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:31,352
Say, Lis, I couldn't help
but notice

8
00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:32,918
you're holding a piece of paper.

9
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:34,529
Oh, this piece of paper?

10
00:01:34,572 --> 00:01:36,792
Why, it's just my
Christmas list, is all.

11
00:01:36,835 --> 00:01:38,272
What a coincidence.

12
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:40,839
I also have my Christmas list
right here in my hand.

13
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:42,711
Oh, you selfish
little gangsters.

14
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:44,843
There's always another
shakedown, isn't there?

15
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:48,151
What do you know, Bart? There's
only one present on my list.

16
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:49,935
My word, that's reasonable.

17
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,634
I, too, only found one present
to be list-worthy.

18
00:01:52,677 --> 00:01:55,202
Oh, give me the lists.

19
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:58,770
We already have a TV.

20
00:01:58,814 --> 00:02:00,207
We've been through
ten Super Bowls,

21
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,774
XLIV through LIII.

22
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:05,516
But our dumb TV
is not a smart TV.

23
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,824
And I just want one other
smart thing in this house.

24
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:10,826
Yeah, well,
we'll think about it.

25
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:17,789
I want everything about
Christmas to be perfect,

26
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:22,838
but that smart TV
the kids want is $2,400.

27
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:24,535
That's ridiculous.

28
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:27,843
Our TV may not be smart,
but it's street smart.

29
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:30,237
It's Sprawl-Mart's
huge Black Friday sale.

30
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,326
Jay-G headphones only $49.99.

31
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:34,545
Two-piece sofa set only $249.99.

32
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:39,811
And this GL50 9K Smart TV
only $499.99.

33
00:02:39,855 --> 00:02:43,380
GL50 9K Smart TV.
Where have I heard that before?

34
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:45,817
The kids are chanting it
nonstop.

35
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:48,777
GL50 9K Smart TV.

36
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,998
- GL50 9K Smart TV.
- Knock it off!

37
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:54,304
Supplies are limited,

38
00:02:54,348 --> 00:02:56,437
so be here when the doors
open at 6:00 a.m.!

39
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,656
Black Friday, like The Purge,
but for bargains.

40
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,093
That's how we get it.
We have to go.

41
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:04,096
Oh, old TV,
you really are dumb.

42
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,361
You just told us how
to replace you.

43
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:10,581
Why do we have an antenna
on an HDTV?

44
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,235
I thought it looked cool.

45
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:16,674
So the customers
will be entering from here,

46
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:18,154
here and here.

47
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,591
Our biggest concern
are the cutsies.

48
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:23,377
- I hate those Nazis.
- I said cutsies.

49
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,293
You think the Nazis
didn't take cuts?

50
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,687
I leave for Sprawl-Mart now,
getting us a good place in line.

51
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:33,517
And I go to sleep now, waking up
in the middle of the night,

52
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:35,345
rested and ready
to relieve you...

53
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,868
- At 3:00 a.m.
- That's right.

54
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:39,828
Godspeed, hot woman.

55
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:47,662
I love you too, Homie,
but I have to go.

56
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:51,492
My tongue is frozen
to your zipper.

57
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:02,894
Aw, Marge,
great to see you out here.

58
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:05,549
You want a Cup O' Noodles
to chase away the chill?

59
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:07,986
- How sweet.
- It's just water.

60
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,727
I can't afford the real thing,

61
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:11,903
but if you stare at the label
while you drink it,

62
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:14,689
you'd swear there was real
chicken powder in there.

63
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:21,173
What bargain are you busting
down the door for?

64
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:24,786
I'm getting a Futon Friend
for my granddaughter.

65
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:27,441
I want her to remember me
as more than just a grandpa

66
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:28,746
who lives at the airport.

67
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,966
The trick is to carry
a piece of empty luggage

68
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:32,794
because then they... they...

69
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:47,504
Sorry, Ralphie,
it's just too cold.

70
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:49,680
Even my blubber isn't helping.

71
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:52,553
Cold in the winter,
hot in the summer.

72
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:55,251
Why did I grow you?

73
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:59,603
Oh, your hands feel cold.
Let me look at them.

74
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:03,781
Whoa, that's toasty!
Am in Ipanema?

75
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:11,746
I can do this.
It's 2:30.

76
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:13,835
Homer's gonna be here
any minute.

77
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,191
What?

78
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:27,544
What the...?

79
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:31,069
Ooh, got to relieve Marge!

80
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:44,431
My hands are starting
to freeze.

81
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:46,520
I hope Homer gets here soon.

82
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:48,565
Why are we standing?

83
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:51,089
We still have hours
before the store opens.

84
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:52,395
To keep out the cutters.

85
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,658
Ow! You're punching me
in the back.

86
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:55,659
I ain't doin' it.

87
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:57,748
It's the baby what's in my belly
thrashing about.

88
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:59,533
If you go into labor,
I'll help you deliver,

89
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:02,405
but then that baby has to go
to the back of the line.

90
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:04,451
Yeah!

91
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:07,889
I know how to hold a baby in.

92
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:15,636
Have a safe Black Friday,

93
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:18,639
and welcome to Thunderdome.

94
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:31,869
My hands are frozen,

95
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:35,917
which makes it easier
to do this.

96
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:43,098
The electronics department.

97
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:44,621
I'm going to make it.

98
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:46,275
I'm not gonna make it!

99
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:52,586
Is there one drop of humanity
in this big-box store?

100
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,590
Don't look, Marge.
At any other time of year,

101
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:59,070
that man's life would be worth
more than a TV,

102
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:00,724
but not at Christmas.

103
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:04,554
Tell my granddaughter
I existed.

104
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:35,063
This will help raise
the little one.

105
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:37,718
<i>Jangle bells, jangle bells</i>

106
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:39,720
<i>We gots a TV</i>

107
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:41,983
<i>Now the only thing we lack</i>

108
00:07:42,026 --> 00:07:44,725
<i>Is electricity, hey!</i>

109
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:46,727
You did it, Marge.

110
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,904
You've given a poor old man
the greatest gift of all.

111
00:07:49,947 --> 00:07:52,776
- A grandchild's love.
- Well, that makes it all...

112
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,561
I can't leave
without one of those.

113
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:55,997
I'll give you
a hundred bucks for it.

114
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,565
Can't say no to that.

115
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:07,748
Marge, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to let you down.

116
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,707
I'm not mad at you. I won't
let myself be mad at you.

117
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:14,102
This is Christmas, and Christmas
is great for our kids,

118
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:16,365
and I vow on my life

119
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:18,802
to make it a great Christmas.

120
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:19,803
I totally agree.

121
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:23,372
Now because you've been
through so much, let me drive.

122
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:30,640
Let me call you an Uber.

123
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:39,823
So I'm afraid
you won't be getting

124
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:41,825
the smart TV for Christmas.

125
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:43,653
We figured.

126
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:45,568
Never get your hopes up
around here.

127
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:49,833
But I promise you, Christmas
will be better than ever.

128
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:51,661
I'll sweep that up, sweetie.

129
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,840
Your mother froze her fingers

130
00:08:56,884 --> 00:08:58,842
trying to get
a Christmas gift for you,

131
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:00,801
and what were you
going to give her?

132
00:09:00,844 --> 00:09:02,846
- Lanyard.
- Poem.

133
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,239
I thought as much.

134
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:07,155
Well, we're gonna make this
Christmas about your mother.

135
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:09,592
- But Christmas is for kids.
- Her.

136
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:11,594
Hi, guys, it's Monica here

137
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,857
with five easy hacks
for resetting

138
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:15,642
your threshold
Christmas caroler.

139
00:09:15,685 --> 00:09:18,645
Number one, locate the P.I.X.
input on the pressure strip.

140
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:21,735
I already did that, Monica.

141
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:25,260
I think I've got it.

142
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:28,611
What if we take Mom on a Florida
vacation for Christmas?

143
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:30,482
Hoy, hoy, hoy.

144
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:32,310
I ride on a pig.

145
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:35,749
Don't forget to leave me
porridge!

146
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:38,099
I've got it set
on Norwegian.

147
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:39,666
Well, at least we're
not planning a vacation

148
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:42,973
at the last second, we're
planning at the last minute.

149
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:45,497
Can't afford
Nine Flags Underwater,

150
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,456
Yankees Fantasy Camp,

151
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:49,414
Yankees Suck Fantasy Camp...

152
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,895
Oh, my God, there's a place
we can afford.

153
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:54,506
I've never heard of it.

154
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,118
How can we be sure
it's what it seems in the ad?

155
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:59,207
That's a good point.
On the other hand...

156
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,687
only three rooms left!

157
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,428
And 58 people
are looking at them.

158
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:05,648
All right, kids,
let this be a lesson.

159
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:07,781
You should never
succumb to something

160
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:09,870
just because
you are pressured to...

161
00:10:09,913 --> 00:10:11,306
One room left!

162
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:14,701
I got it! Full price,
nonrefundable! Boom!

163
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:19,880
Christmas is on me.
Christmas is on me.

164
00:10:19,923 --> 00:10:22,665
Marge, darling,
remember when we agreed

165
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:24,711
you should take it down
a few notches?

166
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:27,148
Yeah, the notches.
Always with the notches.

167
00:10:27,191 --> 00:10:28,889
Marge, have you considered

168
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:31,065
that we could spend Christmas
somewhere else?

169
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:32,240
Home.

170
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:34,329
If it's not home,
it's not Christmas.

171
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:36,244
Home, home, home!

172
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:38,246
We're gonna have to
take her out cold.

173
00:10:53,391 --> 00:10:54,610
You're getting one little...

174
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,046
sleeve and there you go.

175
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,744
- Mom?
- Yes, Lisa? Yes?

176
00:10:57,787 --> 00:11:00,050
- That's not our cat.
- Damn it.

177
00:11:01,443 --> 00:11:04,402
Mom, we came
to sing some carols.

178
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:07,536
And I'll pour the tea.

179
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:10,974
<i>Silent night</i>

180
00:11:11,018 --> 00:11:14,195
<i>Holy night</i>

181
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:17,502
<i>All is calm</i>

182
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:20,984
<i>All is bright</i>

183
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:26,207
<i>Start counting backwards
from ten to one</i>

184
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,862
<i>When you wake up</i>

185
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:33,431
<i>We'll have Christmas fun...</i>

186
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:35,999
Wake up, sleepyhead.

187
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:38,436
- We're in Tennessee.
- Tennessee?

188
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,177
We packed all
the luggage ourselves.

189
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:41,918
After all
that you've been through,

190
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:44,921
this Christmas is about you.

191
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:46,923
The warm air helped my hands.

192
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:49,230
I like Tennessee.

193
00:11:49,273 --> 00:11:51,014
That's fantastic.

194
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:52,755
However, we just
entered Georgia.

195
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,801
Change the bumper sticker, boy.

196
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,457
Dirty Birds! You got that right!

197
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,851
Yeah! Go, area team!

198
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,777
Enjoying the sunshine?

199
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:17,127
That's the Christmas gift
we get all year long.

200
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:19,129
Can we please get to our room?

201
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:22,263
We just drove 2,000 miles
in four hours.

202
00:12:22,306 --> 00:12:24,047
Of course.

203
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:27,398
And thank you for reminding me
why I never had kids.

204
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:29,879
Let's go, shall we?

205
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:36,886
All of us
in this one little room?

206
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,279
I call sleeping in the bathtub!

207
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:40,063
I want to sleep in the bathtub.

208
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:42,892
There's no bathtub.
Just a combo shower and toilet.

209
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:44,024
We call it a shoilet.

210
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:46,678
Well, the fun is outside.

211
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:51,031
Ooh, that's gonna be a big one.

212
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:55,035
Oh, I don't know how we're gonna
give you kids a Christmas.

213
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:58,647
Dad, Bart,
meet me in the shoilet.

214
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,823
D'oh!

215
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:03,086
Let me tell you something
about your mother.

216
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,221
She is always as happy
as the saddest one of us.

217
00:13:07,264 --> 00:13:09,658
I'm not always the saddest one.

218
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:12,443
Polar bears are dying.

219
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:14,837
Oh, that's so sad.

220
00:13:14,881 --> 00:13:18,493
So, rain or shine, we will
all have smiles on our faces.

221
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:21,670
Her mood will be based
on the signals we are giving.

222
00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:22,976
All hands in.

223
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:25,239
Okay, three, two, one...

224
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:27,067
Fake enthusiasm.

225
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,938
What are you guys doing in here?

226
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:30,679
Having a great time.

227
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:32,333
That's about to get better.

228
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:34,857
Really?

229
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:37,468
Who wants room service?

230
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:45,781
This is cool. Cartoon characters
no one's ever heard of.

231
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,654
That's Mulberry Mutt, Tremendous
Boar and Thelonious Skunk.

232
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:52,135
- Does somebody want a hug?
- No.

233
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:55,138
- Oh, I think you do.
- Really, I don't.

234
00:13:55,182 --> 00:13:56,705
Hug the bull, boy.

235
00:13:56,748 --> 00:14:00,840
That's right, kid. Legally,
you have to initiate it.

236
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,889
That's so sweet.

237
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:18,770
You know, they say whenever
you travel, it grows your brain.

238
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:20,990
This place is fantastic.

239
00:14:21,034 --> 00:14:22,731
This place is a dump.

240
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:24,907
I picked it!
If you criticize this place,

241
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:26,517
you're criticizing me!

242
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:28,693
Well, in that case,
this place is a loser

243
00:14:28,737 --> 00:14:30,304
with a gambling problem.

244
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:33,176
That's the worst thing
the kids could possibly hear.

245
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,962
I won once, when I met you.

246
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:39,704
Come here.

247
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,926
Oh, for God's sake.
I'll stop this.

248
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:52,935
Get this over with quick!
There's kids next door!

249
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,719
There's kids in here too!

250
00:14:59,594 --> 00:15:02,379
Makes you feel kind of
lonely, doesn't it?

251
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:05,382
- Yeah.
- Well, it all starts with a hug.

252
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:07,819
You want a hug?

253
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:27,578
Oh, boy.
You kids are up early.

254
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:29,798
Bart and I are going
to engage in perhaps

255
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:33,149
the most popular
Florida tradition...

256
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:36,065
complaining to the manager.

257
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:39,547
Hey, come on in.

258
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,811
This place is nothing
like it looked on the internet.

259
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:44,856
We can't compete
with the big boys.

260
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,251
Disney's already laying ground
for a new Family GuyWorld.

261
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:50,601
<i>Lucky there's
a family guy...</i>

262
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:54,823
I was the it boy in 2006.

263
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:56,825
I don't know when
and I don't know how,

264
00:15:56,868 --> 00:16:00,481
but I am gonna get you.

265
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:04,920
Well, at least something
in this place is clean now.

266
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,923
That was
the most horrifying ride

267
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,707
I've ever been on.

268
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:13,885
Where's Maggie?

269
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,682
Oh, this is so much fun.
You know how I love history.

270
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:31,642
It's like looking at a rogues
gallery of America's villains.

271
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:35,211
According to the soundtrack to Hamilton,
you were a real jerk.

272
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:39,128
Vice presidents rule!

273
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:42,218
Are you really having
a great time?

274
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:46,614
Really? Because I sure
as heck am not.

275
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:51,184
No, I'm FaceTiming Milhouse
'cause it's more fun.

276
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:52,620
Whassup?

277
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:54,100
Milhouse, give me something.

278
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:56,450
I'm trapped
in The Hall of Vice Presidents.

279
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:59,975
Well, I'm kind of
the vice president of us.

280
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,716
Got to go.

281
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,197
And we've got to go.
Back home.

282
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,155
We can be in Springfield
by Christmas

283
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:08,853
if we can just
get our money back.

284
00:17:08,897 --> 00:17:11,030
Leave that to me.

285
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:30,788
I shot my best friend
in the face.

286
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,682
There it is, the first snow.

287
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:57,250
It smells so clean.

288
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,797
Oh, my God.

289
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,105
Moe serves Christmas dinner
to the old and needy.

290
00:18:28,063 --> 00:18:31,414
Yeah, look, it's the one
nice thing I do.

291
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,155
Guess old Moe's got a heart.

292
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:36,289
Also, if I turn the rummy away,
they might wind up in church.

293
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:37,594
That could turn
their life around.

294
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:39,640
That's bad for business.

295
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:43,774
Moe, I never dreamed you were
capable of such a sweet thing.

296
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:46,081
Oh, no, I beg you,
don't make a moment out of this.

297
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:51,391
You missed my tongue there,
but that's all right.

298
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:56,831
Everyone,
please close your eyes.

299
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:59,268
Boy, you do the honors.

300
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:02,097
Dear Lord, we didn't get
the gift we wanted,

301
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,751
a GL50 9K Smart TV.

302
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:05,666
The place we went was a dump.

303
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:07,755
But isn't Christmas really about

304
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:10,192
being with your family
and your bartender?

305
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:12,063
We have traveled
many miles to learn

306
00:19:12,107 --> 00:19:14,805
there's no place like Moe's.

307
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:17,373
Amen.

308
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:23,249
If you're not going
to buy something, leave.

309
00:19:26,862 --> 00:19:29,646
Bart, I disrespected you
and I'm sorry.

310
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,475
I've refunded your money
plus $2,400

311
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:35,826
if you pledge
to never come here again.

312
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,699
And please tell
your sister she's pretty.

313
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:41,441
Not Lisa, the baby.

314
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:43,269
You can't win in Florida.

315
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:45,271
Oh, my God,
why don't your batteries die?

316
00:19:45,314 --> 00:19:47,882
I have a solar head.

317
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:50,667
Well, you'll be happy to know

318
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:52,452
we've put the money to good use.

319
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:57,239
Now, to celebrate Christmas
the way our ancestors did.

320
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:02,592
You know, there's a real log
burning below it, right?

321
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:05,247
Yeah, but is it HD?
