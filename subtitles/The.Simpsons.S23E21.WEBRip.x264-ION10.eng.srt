Okay, people, we are trying

19
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,518
{\an8}to depict
the sizzling final days

20
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,107
{\an8}of the Nathan Lane
of the New Testament, Jesus Christ.

21
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,153
{\an8}Now remember,
this is the Passion Play,

22
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,357
{\an8}not The Phone It In Play.

23
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,236
{\an8}not the I Once Had Three Shows
on Broadway Simultaneously

24
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,204
{\an8}But I Blew All My Money on Coke
and Now Here I Am Play,

25
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,115
{\an8}so let's do this thing!

26
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,873
{\an8}Hi. My name is
Milhouse Van Houten,

27
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,286
{\an8}and I am auditioning
for the role of Child Who Points.

28
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,836
{\an8}Yeah, okay, point stage left.

29
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,459
{\an8}I prepared right!

30
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,127
{\an8}Well, I better get going.

31
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,335
{\an8}This is starting to feel
a little churchy.

32
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,545
{\an8}Why do we have to audition
for the stupid play,

33
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,596
{\an8}and Dad gets to leave?

34
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,099
{\an8}I already have my part.

35
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,140
{\an8}Man Who Buys Ticket,
But Doesn't Show Up.

36
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,564
{\an8}Also, the Passion Play
isn't stupid.

37
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,604
{\an8}It's the greatest story
ever told.

38
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,018
{\an8}Maybe it was once,

39
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,436
{\an8}but now there's
lots of better stories.

40
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,725
{\an8}<i>Krusty vs. the F.D.A.</i>

41
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,608
{\an8}Game Six of
the 2011 World Series.

{\an8}-Hitler mashups!
-And Lenny's story about Cancun.

43
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,832
{\an8}Yeah, why aren't we
doing Lenny's story?

44
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,119
{\an8}That thing's hilarious.

45
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,832
{\an8}Not so hilarious for me.

46
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:43,832
{\an8}I nearly lost a toe.

47
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,003
{\an8}That's what you get

48
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,881
{\an8}for having a monkey
give you a foot massage.

49
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,038
{\an8}My bucket list
is my business.

50
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,297
{\an8}-Next audition!
-Ah-ha. Name's Ned Flanders.

51
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,879
{\an8}Credits include Jesus
in the Passion Play last year,

52
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,795
{\an8}Jesus in the Passion Play
the year before that,

53
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,684
{\an8}Jesus, Jesus, a kindly hobo
who turns out to be--

54
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,012
{\an8}you guessed it-- Saint Peter...

55
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,217
{\an8}Enough! Enough, already.

56
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,977
{\an8}I'm so bored I'm ready
to introduce myself

57
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,138
{\an8}to my two assistants here.

58
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,266
{\an8}You will be
a non-speaking Pharisee.

59
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,403
{\an8}-But-but-but...
-Jesus didn't stammer!

60
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,900
{\an8}His voice hit the back
of the theater!

61
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,862
{\an8}He was a god
who turned water into wine

62
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,242
{\an8}and did not wear shoes.

63
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,319
{\an8}Ooh!

64
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,993
{\an8}He said simple things
that many followed.

65
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,491
{\an8}Just like me on Twitter!

66
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,663
{\an8}(chuckles)

67
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,992
{\an8}And he was tragically killed
while still in his 30s...

68
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,037
{\an8}-D'oh!
-...after an all-night dinner.

69
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,331
{\an8}Woo-hoo!
I'm your Jesus! Me!

70
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,955
{\an8}Boom. Done.
This guy's perfect!

71
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,502
{\an8}You understand why God
would have forsaken him.

72
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,626
{\an8}(chuckling)

73
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,553
{\an8}Well, congratulations, Homer.

74
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,762
{\an8}I guess this is just
my cross to bear.

75
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,092
{\an8}What's that a reference to?

76
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,347
{\an8}Oh!

77
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,102
{\an8}Ooh, nice and roomy.

78
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,731
{\an8}Our Lord sure knew
how to keep 'em cool.

79
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,058
{\an8}-Dad?
-Yes, sweetie?

80
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,023
{\an8}First of all,

81
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,902
{\an8}congratulations
on getting the lead.

82
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,609
{\an8}Whee! Whee!

83
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,691
{\an8}I just hope you're going
to take this seriously.

84
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,817
{\an8}Oh, yes, Lisa.

85
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,953
{\an8}Very seriously. Whee!

86
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,870
{\an8}Dad, the story of the Passion

87
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,949
{\an8}is the cornerstone
of the Christian faith.

88
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,294
{\an8}And although I personally follow

89
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,079
{\an8}the enlightened teachings
of Lord Buddha,

90
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,752
{\an8}messing with Jesus
really gets people mad.

91
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,131
{\an8}It's like wearing
a Florida State jersey

92
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,289
{\an8}to a Florida game.

93
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,457
{\an8}(gasps)

94
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,964
{\an8}Oh, Lord, why have you placed

95
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,466
{\an8}this fearsome burden
on my shoulders?

96
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,048
{\an8}(sobbing)

97
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,303
{\an8}It'll be fine.
Just learn your lines.

98
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,806
{\an8}Does Jesus have a big part
in this thing?

99
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,058
He's in every scene.

100
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,389
What?

101
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,984
(sobbing loudly)

102
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,979
Why do I succeed at everything
I audition for?

103
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,614
Dear Lord, I know you see all,

104
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,953
but trust me,
You do not want to see this.

105
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:44,783
And so our Lord was brought
before Pontius Pilate.

106
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,117
What's he in for?

107
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:49,042
He calls himself
"King of the Jews."

108
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,372
Oh, boy.
Okay, be straight with me.

109
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,877
You can probably
plead this down to crucifixion.

110
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,590
Do you call yourself
King of the Jews?

111
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,051
Thou sayest it.

112
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,551
(exclaiming)

113
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,342
He's good.

114
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,716
Wow, I'm so moved
I renounce science,

115
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,223
with the facts,
and the peer reviews,

116
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,215
and the hypotheses
tested by evidence.

117
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:12,808
What shall I do then with Jesus,
which is called Christ?

118
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,475
Crucify him!

119
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,444
They cannot judge me.

120
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,154
Only my father can judge me.

121
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,815
Crucify him!

122
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,573
I'll take you with me, old man!

123
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,065
Jesus was handed
a heavy cross,

124
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,908
and upon his brow
was placed a crown...

125
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,504
-Ooh!
-...of thorns.

126
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,120
What the...?

127
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,879
(groans)

128
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,797
(crying)

129
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,589
Daughters of Jerusalem!

130
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,882
Weep not for me,

131
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,506
but weep for yourselves.

132
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,803
You know, Homer's giving it
the old Bible-college try.

133
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:50,018
Maybe I should've dialed down
the Doubting Thomas.

134
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,189
Silence, Pharisee!

135
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,397
(grunting)

136
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,781
Looks like someone didn't
follow the underwear rule!

137
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,120
This man is totally
the Son of God.

138
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:14,173
Tonight you shall be
at my right hand in heaven.

139
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,958
All right!

140
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,752
It pays to network
at these things.

141
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,923
Jesus cried again
with a loud voice

142
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,256
and yielded up his spirit.

143
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,892
(cries out in anguish)

144
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,694
(quietly)
Lord, forgive me for my pride.

145
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,770
All wise as always, you have
rightly raised Homer above me.

146
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,527
Never again will I question...

147
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,779
(yells)

148
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,200
-Out of my way, stupid Flanders!
-Ow!

149
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,369
Ah, I knew we should've done
<i>Spamalot.</i>

150
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,118
I'm not licked.

151
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,540
I'll just make them
think this was planned.

152
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,749
(imitates drum brushes)

153
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,040
<i>♪ Who's to say ♪</i>

154
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,463

155
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,211
<i>♪ Who's to say, and curtain! ♪</i>

156
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,424
Diddily...
doodily...

157
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,045
No atheist blood, please.

158
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,302
Sorry, ma'am, only members
of the immediate family allowed in.

159
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,135
It's okay.
She's my wife.

160
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,470
(gasping)

161
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,055
Ned and Edna, married?

162
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,140
That's right. Ha!

163
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,596
-CROWD: Wow!
-Oh, my goodness.

164
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,646
Hey, Dad.

165
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,268
You remember when you said
if Flanders got remarried

166
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,356
you'd eat your hat?

167
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,531
Uh-oh.

168
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,646
Ooh, licorice!

169
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:31,659
Mmm, historically inaccurate.

170
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,287
Well, it was nice having
a secret marriage while it lasted.

171
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,085
Well, sir, now we'll
have an open marriage!

172
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,380
Um...

173
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,213
you do know what that means?

174
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,378
No, but I'm sure Newt Gingrich
wouldn't steer us wrong.

175
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,838
At least in the hospital

176
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,467
we can just enjoy a nice,
quiet moment together.

177
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,806
(chuckling)

178
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,103
Congratulations, you two!

179
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,728
We're so, so happy for you.

180
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,654
Welcome to marriage.

181
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,693
(laughs)

182
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,025
Another good man
bites the dust.

183
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,111
Homer!

184
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,356
I'm talking about this guy!

185
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,825
Oh, I sure envy him.

186
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,040
Homer!

187
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,409
I mean, I envy Flanders,

188
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,706
once again enjoying
the joys of marriage.

189
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,499
Let's put it to a vote,
America.

190
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,003
Enough with the voting.

191
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,254
Ned, Edna,
why didn't you tell us?

192
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,507
'Cause everyone in this town

193
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,758
makes such a big heckabaloo
out of everything.

194
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,340
Nedding bells are ringing.

195
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,385
See what happens
when Teachy met Preachy

196
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,430
on Channel 6,

197
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,313
your source for news-based puns.

198
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,770
I was just down the hall
getting some very bad news,

199
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,441
and I saw there was
a party going on.

200
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,690
Congratulations from the Mayor.
Vote Quimby.

201
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,362
Many happy returns!

202
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,861
Hope you're both happy.

203
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,823
Edna, as the runner-up
in the race for your heart,

204
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,953
I would like to make a toast.

205
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,320
My Dearest,
let me be the first to offer you

206
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,947
the hearty handshake
that would've climaxed

207
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,495
our own wedding day...

208
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:01,208
Seymour, did you use my wig glue
to patch your shoes again?

209
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,040
I tied them together
with used dental floss,

210
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,376
as per your memo!

211
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,301
Everybody out. Now!

212
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,880
(grumbling)

213
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,894
-Not you.
-Mmm.

214
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:17,563
O Lord, please bless
our blended family.

215
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,350
And thank you
for "cigarette mommy."

216
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,314
Oh, honey, please don't
call me that.

217
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,975
Okay, "do-over mommy."

218
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,233
Boys, you will please
call your new mother

219
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,395
whatever she feels
comfortable with.

220
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,494
How about "Edna?"

221
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,819
It's disrespectful

222
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,663
to call a grown-up
by their first name.

223
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,238
BART:
Yo, Homer,

224
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,743
Mom says get your fat ass
over to the Flanders'.

225
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,656
Bart! Don't call me that!

226
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,004
Which one?
"Homer" or "fat ass"?

227
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,210
HOMER:
Why, you little...

228
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,330
They're both bad,
and I suspect you know it!

229
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,838
BART: Get your hands
off of me, you fat ass!

230
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,841
(doorbell rings)

231
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,263
Ned, Edna.

232
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,011
-We just want to apologize...
-(growling)

233
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,763
...for the commotion
in your room.

234
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,715
People here do not
respect boundaries.

235
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,226
Homer, did you just buckle
your belt through my loop?

236
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,097
Sorry.

237
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,685
Well, we're here to offer
to throw you a little party

238
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,771
in your honor.

239
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,016
A little party might be fun.

240
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,937
The only guests at our wedding
were Ned's parents.

241
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,947
Look at those squares,

242
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,699
makin' it nice and legal.

243
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,780
We didn't need a piece of paper!

244
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,486
We had a paper, Nedward.

245
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,786
We just rolled it
and smoked it.

246
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,950
Oh, yeah.

247
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,788
We got high-diddily-high
on that reeferino.

248
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,214
Less news from the pews.

249
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,633
Okay, Simpsons.
Well, call me a cock-eyed optimist

250
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,722
'cause I think some sort
of celebration party

251
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:33,798
might possibly be fun!

252
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,143
Great!
We'll take care of everything.

253
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,178
We'll just need
to borrow your punch bowl,

254
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,852
17 chairs,
your portable dance floor,

255
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,851
your banner printer,
banner ink,

256
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,393
and a ream of blank banners.

257
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,856
Okay, there's no school;

258
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,899
your dad's at work;
and it's really coming down.

259
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,074
Anyone for Scrabble?

260
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,572
Only God can make words.

261
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,485
Right, right. Yahtzee?

262
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,163
Dice are Satan's bones.

263
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,911
What the hey, Mrs. K?

264
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,583
Thank God, a real kid.

265
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,622
You want my advice
on dealing with the Hardly Boys?

266
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:05,785
Why do you care?

267
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,673
I don't. I'm just bored
watching worms drown.

268
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,791
Okay, what do you got?

269
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,837
Well, what you got to do
is get them into the real world.

270
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,842
Skipping is cool!

271
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,844
Especially when you're holding
hands with your brother.

272
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,967
If you don't act now,
when they grow up,

273
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,394
people like me
are gonna take

274
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,102
all their money
and girlfriends.

275
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,432
Oh, come on.
They're not that hopeless.

276
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,598
I'm doing it!
I'm doing it!

277
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,687
(whimpers)

278
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,864
This is my third-favorite
wedding supply store.

279
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,704
Whoo! Look at these.

280
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,029
"Extreme weddings.

281
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,244
Triathlon...
Zero-G...

282
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,294
Tie the knot
at the top of Mount Everest"?

283
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,334
It's extreme enough
for me

284
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,337
when they smear the wedding cake
on each other's faces.

285
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,510
So, Marge,
the rumors are true.

286
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,168
Why did you get
to throw a party

287
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,337
for Ned and Edna
and not me?

288
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,466
Well, you're all invited so you
can make your snippy comments

289
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,014
while you eat
my hors d'oeuvres.

290
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,478
Snippy? How can you say that
in those shoes?

291
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,389
(grunts)

292
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,056
They have Itchy and Scratchy
weddings?

293
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,901
(laughing)

294
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,910
Ready to go home, Ned?

295
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,042
I'm sorry, honey, but I'm
stuck in this meeting

296
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,409
of the Springfield LGBT.

297
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,955
The left-gifted bidextrous
and transhanded community.

298
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,250
We're trying to decide on the theme
for our Left is Right parade.

299
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,335
"Our Scissors, Ourselves."

300
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,591
How about,
"Death to Righties"?

301
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,422
We have to live
among them.

302
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,257
To live among them
is to die.

303
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,592
(all arguing)

304
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,387
Oh, this could go late.

305
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,221
We haven't even ordered
pizzas and pop yet.

306
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,926
Could you handle
Rod and Todd's

307
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,596
parent-teacher
conference for me?

308
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,444
Sure, I'd love
to be the parent for once.

309
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,149
Now I can bring a latte

310
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,939
and leave the cup
on the desk. Ha!

311
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,443
(glass breaks)

312
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:59,034
Sorry. I'm still
a pre-op transhander.

313
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,071
TEACHER:
Well, I must say at this school

314
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,485
<i>we've never seen</i>
<i>a step-parent before.</i>

315
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,704
Look, I'm a chalk jockey, too,

316
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,195
so don't slap ketchup
on bread

317
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,246
and tell me it's Pizza Friday.

318
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,370
You teach with that mouth?

319
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,957
Yes. I teach
at Springfield Elementary,

320
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,384
-and we believe that...
-Public school?

321
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,673
Well, I'll be a monkey's
unrelated creature.

322
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,717
Well, we'll fit you
into our school prayers.

323
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,052
You do have science
here, right?

324
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,557
We sure do.

325
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,060
Behold advanced astronomy.

326
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,904
You pulled the boys
out of school?

327
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,069
Ned, I know I should have
consulted you,

328
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,688
but that school
is beneath them.

329
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,235
Take my word as a teacher
of 15 years.

330
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,739
Well, sir, when we got married,

331
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,991
I knew I'd find some spices
in my chili.

332
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,873
I guess they can go
to Springfield Hellementary.

333
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,581
-Oh!
-Mm-hmm.

334
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,501
(moaning)

335
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,840
Why are we here, Neddy?

336
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,835
Well, first of all,
I think talking dogs

337
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,387
-are the spawn of the devil.
-Yeah, but...

338
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,520
Secondly, we're watching my little
Toddy graduate from college.

339
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,059
Oh, now aren't you glad
you let Edna take charge

340
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,733
of the boys' education?

341
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,482
Yep, it's lucky
she's not in my taxes

342
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,194
'cause I underestimated her.

343
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,734
Wait a minute.
Liberal professors,

344
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,398
feminist workshops,
abstract sculptures.

345
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,527
This isn't a Midwestern
Bible college.

346
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,534
This is an elite
East Coast university.

347
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,329
It's okay, Daddy.

348
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,462
-I majored in religious studies.
-Whew!

349
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,330
Comparative religious studies.

350
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,208
(screams)

351
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,795
(tires screech)

352
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,505
Give me your keys!

353
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,885
Maybe I'll just park it myself.

354
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,142
Why are you parking yourself?
Why are you parking yourself?

355
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,225
We haven't taken in
one car all day.

356
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,775
You really put on
a great reception, Marge.

357
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,689
It's like the happy flashback

358
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,147
in a gritty cop thriller.

359
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:09,827
Thank you.
Everyone's having a great time.

360
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,079
Uh-oh.

361
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,834
Helen, have a canapé.

362
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,753
There's enough for everyone.

363
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,211
But not too much.
(chuckles)

364
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,002
(gasps)

365
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,165
(both giggling)

366
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,593
Yar...

367
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,211
No weird hookups!

368
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,928
Call me!

369
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,378
I'm married to the sea,

370
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,678
and I'm seeing two
of the Great Lakes on the side.

371
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,062
I won't say which ones,

372
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,848
but it's eerie
how superior they are.

373
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,193
So how do the boys
like Springfield Elementary?

374
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,112
Marge, it's wonderful.

375
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,781
They're opening up,
they've seen a wider world.

376
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,030
I wrote with a Flair pen.

377
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,372
(chuckles)
Well, that's just great, boys.

378
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,028
Now come over here so
Mrs. Simpson can take a photo.

379
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,447
Make sure our temporary tats
are in the picture.

380
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,076
Mine's a sassy princess
who speaks her mind.

381
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,084
Oh!

382
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,665
Mine's a duck
with no pants.

383
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,420
What if we were
raptured right now?

384
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,922
Ned,
I said it was okay.

385
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,634
Yeah, chillax, Daddy.

386
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,844
Chillax?
Young man, in the Flanders' house

387
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,385
we speak the King's diddily.

388
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,588
Time for cake!

389
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,388
Let's finish this sucker up.

390
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,271
You get my boys tattoos,
you change their school,

391
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,729
you buy Rod sneakers that light
up like Times Square.

392
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,851
Shoes are shoes
and lights are lights.

393
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,728
Now just when do I get a say
in how my boys are raised?!

394
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,566
This marriage isn't perfect!

395
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,241
(phones beeping)

396
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,239
No video! Party over!

397
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,411
Cake!

398
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,910
Too late, Marge.

399
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,992
Mm!

400
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,747
Ned, these boys trust me
to be their mother.

401
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,250
You'd better decide
whether you do.

402
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,632
(gasps)

403
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,963
And that's that.
Another story in the classic,

404
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,166
infallible three-act structure.

405
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,467
Good enough for Aristotle,

406
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,970
good enough for the Simpsons.

407
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,761
Mr. Syzslak,
I have a feeling

408
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,925
there's gonna be one more act
to this story.

409
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,104
Well, I'm not hanging
around for that.

410
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,352
Four acts...

411
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,771
Ned, how did you sleep?

412
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,187
Fine, I guess.

413
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,815
Thanks for loaning me
your pajamas, Homer.

414
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:11,361
And, Marge, thank you for those
helpful chip bag clips.

415
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,867
(clacking)

416
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,203
I just felt so ashamed,

417
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,365
I couldn't go home.

418
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,583
Yesterday
I gave in to the one thing

419
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:24,213
I vowed I would never have
in my marriage: strong feeling.

420
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,753
Here's your lunches...
with some cake.

421
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:30,377
You'll be having cake
for a long, long time.

422
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,296
Bart, aren't you
gonna tell Mom and Dad

423
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,724
about the problem
you have?

424
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:34,892
Shut up!

425
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,600
I'm just saying
it won't get better

426
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,560
unless you talk
to an adult.

427
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,100
Maggie knows how
to keep a secret.

428
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,144
Why can't you?

429
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,019
Bart, is there something
you want to tell us?

430
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,316
Oh, Marge,
let the kid have

431
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,239
his embarrassing secrets
and lies.

432
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,239
That is totally
irresponsible parenting.

433
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,241
Not according to the Internet.

434
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,823
Where on the Internet?

435
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,288
I'm sure some idiot somewhere
agrees with me.

436
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,749
Why would you believe him?

437
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,419
Because his avatar
is Darth Maul,

438
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,789
the second-coolest Darth.

439
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,166
And what he says is true
because it's in all caps.

440
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,014
Are you gonna argue with caps?

441
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,340
Why does that make it right?

442
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,344
He took the time to press
the shift key, Marge.

443
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,427
I think he knows
what he's talking about.

444
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,103
So after all this time together
you two still haven't agreed

445
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,522
on how to raise your kids?

446
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,440
Ned, I realized long ago
there are some things

447
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,400
Homer and I will never
completely agree on.

448
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,441
(chuckles)
Yeah, but we make sure

449
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,235
never to go to bed hungry.

450
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,398
It's "angry."

451
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,106
Don't tell me
what our thing is!

452
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,196
It's about not
agreeing on something.

453
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,531
I've always said hungry!

454
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,787
Bart,
just tell us the problem.

455
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,368
I'm keeping a dolphin
in my bathtub!

456
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,787
I thought I heard
clicks and pops!

457
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,126
(microphone feeds back)

458
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,801
Children, your test scores
are down

459
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,589
because we've been having
so many assemblies,

460
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,513
you haven't had time to study.

461
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,051
This assembly will remedy that.

462
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,295
We've invited
a few friends over

463
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,506
to give you some musical cues.

464
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,346
(piano plays bouncy intro)

465
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,931
I'm Sally Scantron Sheet.

466
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,187
And I'm Peter Pencil.

467
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,099
Now, you didn't hear it
from us,

468
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,397
but the answers
to the test are...

469
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,741
<i>(to tune of "Mary Had a Little Lamb")</i>
<i>♪ A, B, D, D, C, A, B... ♪</i>

470
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,819
Are you just giving
them the answers?

471
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,664
They still have
to sign their names properly,

472
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,409
so we're not totally
out of woods.

473
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,661
Pause the assembly!

474
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,583
I have to talk to my wife.

475
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,752
-Ned?
-My rival.

476
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,831
Some rivalry.

477
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,835
It's like Secretariat
versus a can of dog food.

478
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,668
Edna, I'm sorry,
and I'll say it in front of God

479
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,674
or Groundskeeper Willie.

480
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,255
Oh, Ned,
I'm sorry, too.

481
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,050
I overstepped
your boundaries.

482
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,514
I guess I never really truly cared
about children before.

483
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,136
-(all gasp)
-Oh, get over it.

484
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,563
And, Ned, I'll be exactly

485
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,521
as much mom as you
want me to be.

486
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,812
Hey, the Simpsons
make it up as they go along,

487
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,686
and they're as happy
as a ribbon in a Bible.

488
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,112
-What do you say, sweetie?
-Ha!

489
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,532
-Mmm...
-Mmm...

490
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,780
(cheering)

491
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,202
Now in our 50th location
in Springfield.

492
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,951
Sleazy Sam would like
to welcome our special

493
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,544
grand-opening star,
Jesus.

494
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,041
Welcome, money changers.

495
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,543
You can trust Sleazy Sam

496
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,665
for the best rates,
or my name isn't Jesus H....

497
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,554
-(thunder cracks)
-Ow!

498
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,881
Are you gonna do that

499
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,795
every time
I open one of these?
