00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,517
D'oh!

MARGE: (humming)

00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,959
ANNOUNCER:
<i>The start of television's</i>

10
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:29,588
<i>Mid-season, is just 200 exciting</i>
<i>seconds away.</i>

11
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,472
{\an8}-Door?
-Locked.

12
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,969
{\an8}-Phone?
-Unplugged.

13
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:33,971
{\an8}Dog? Cat?

14
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,222
{\an8}-Taped and corked.
-Perfect.

15
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:39,144
{\an8}ANNOUNCER: <i>It's</i>
America's funniest tornadoes.

16
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,731
{\an8}(Bart and Homer laughing)

17
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,520
{\an8}ANNOUNCER: <i>And at 09:30,</i>
All in the family 1999.

18
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:49,605
{\an8}Oh, geez, there they got me
living with an African American.

19
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,452
{\an8}A Semite American
and a woman American, there.

20
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,859
{\an8}And I'm glad, I love yous all.

21
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,318
{\an8}I love everybody.

22
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,697
{\an8}I wish I'd saved my money
from the first show.

23
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,365
{\an8}Oh, I can't wait.

24
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,333
{\an8}Look, Marge,
I had a scorecard printed up

25
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,373
{\an8}at that all-night scorecard place.

26
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,417
{\an8}Isn't mid-season
just a dumping ground

27
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,001
{\an8}for second-rate shows
that weren't good enough

28
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,206
{\an8}for the fall schedule?

29
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,205
{\an8}You're thinking
of all the other years.

30
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,837
{\an8}This year's shows are classics.

31
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,135
{\an8}There's <i>The Laughter Family,</i>
that's animated.

32
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,679
{\an8}Networks like animation

33
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,602
{\an8}'cause they don't have to pay
the actors squat.

34
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,021
{\an8}(imitation Ned)
Plus, they can replace them

35
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,639
{\an8}and no one can tell
the diddley-ifference.

36
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,765
{\an8}ANNOUNCER: <i>And now, mid-season</i>
<i>kicks off with </i>Admiral Baby.

37
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:26,904
{\an8}Yee-hee-hee!

38
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:32,533
{\an8}We're taking the entire
sixth fleet to Candy Island?

39
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,990
{\an8}Those are the Admiral's orders.

40
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,610
{\an8}(gurgles)

41
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,617

{\an8}(groans)

43
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,285
{\an8}It's hard to believe
someone that young

44
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,329
{\an8}could have risen
to the rank of Admiral.

45
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:48,293
{\an8}Gee, I never thought
I'd say this about a TV show.

46
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,456
{\an8}But this is kind of stupid.

47
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,046
{\an8}Hey, <i>Police Cops.</i>

48
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,342
{\an8}That sounds like
a lethal combination.

49
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,103
{\an8}Let's get this bank
back to our hideout

50
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,142
{\an8}and we'll break into it later.

51
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,097
{\an8}It's the cops.

52
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,516
{\an8}Worse. The police cops.

53
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,688
(yells)

54
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,447
(grunting)

55
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,873
(screams)

56
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,578
-This isn't bad.
-"Isn't bad"?

57
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,249
Tell me one thing mankind's
ever done that's any better.

58
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,289
The renaissance.

59
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,581
This is better.

60
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,370
Let's book 'em and roll.

61
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,788
And that's the end
of that chapter.

62
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,955
You men saved my bank.

63
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,047
I'd like to donate $40
to charity in your honor.

64
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,890
But I don't know your names.

65
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:40,889
Lance Coffman.

66
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,850
Simpson,
detective Homer Simpson.

67
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,392
(gasping)

68
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,146
He's named like my name!

69
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,980
GIRLS: (giggling)

70
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,567
(chuckles)

71
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,729
I don't get it, Homer.

72
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,235
You're a millionaire

73
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,108
and you've got all
the babes you want.

74
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,235
Why aren't you living it up
in your palace in Europe?

75
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,952
Well, let's just say I hate crime.

76
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,164
(groans)

77
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,539
(grunts)

78
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,539
Arrest that guy.

79
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,924
And that's the end of that chapter.

80
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:19,683
Wow, they've captured
my personality perfectly.

81
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,759
Did you see the way
daddy caught that bullet?

82
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,054
That's not really you, dad.

83
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,467
He's just a fictional character

84
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,595
who happens to have
the same name.

85
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,270
Don't confuse daddy, Lisa.

86
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,232
Homer, it's just a coincidence.

87
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,232
Like that guy named
Anthony Michael Hall

88
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,154
who stole your car stereo.

89
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,783
Right. Coincidence.

90
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,319
(telephone rings)

91
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,702
Another person wants
to congratulate you

92
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,372
for having a famous name.

93
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,831
Hello.

94
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,710
Yes, this is
the original Homer Simpson.

95
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,868
Who's this?

96
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,125
The Debbie Pinson

97
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,168
who was the homecoming queen
in high school?

98
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,627
Yes, I'm still available.

99
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,723
No, he's not.

100
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,628
Marge, that was Debbie Pinson!

101
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,138
Debbie Pinson!

102
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,510
No dating.

103
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,636
Ohhh!

104
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,138
Hey, Homer, Homer, check it out.

105
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,386
Bottom of page 12.

106
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,807
"Local man has same name.

107
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,146
A TV character has

108
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,991
the same name as Springfield
resident Homer Simpson."

109
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,278
Hey, you're famous.

110
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:23,491
"And that's the end
of that chapter."

111
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,823
(all exclaim)

112
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,827
Mr. Simpson, sir,
can I get your autograph?

113
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,580
All right. What's the name?

114
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,712
Homer, we've worked together
for ten years.

115
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,579
It's "Carl."

116
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,590
You only wrote my name.

117
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,920
Um, I wanted yours.

118
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,465
Take it or leave it... Carl.

119
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,049
So, uh, what kind of adventure

120
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,216
you going to be involved
in tonight, Homer?

121
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,305
Mm, who knows?

122
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,349
Maybe I'll have to foil
an assassination

123
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,233
or stop a peace conference.

124
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,230
So they really based that

125
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,191
Homer Simpson character on you,
huh?

126
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,361
Yep, right down to the scarf.

127
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,531
-(crowd gasping)
-MOE: Ooh, there it is.

128
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:05,865
Nice beating, Lance.

129
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,868
Especially around the eyes.
It...

130
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,870
Say, where's your partner?
Where's Homer Simpson?

131
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,213
HOMER SIMPSON: Coming, Chief!

132
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,328
Whoa! Whoa!

133
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,205
Now what have you done, Simpson?

134
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:20,302
I was supervising
the "Guns for Toys" program.

135
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,420
It's "Toys for Guns".

136
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,547
Now you tell me.

137
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,684
Oh, Simpson!

138
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,892
(all laughing)

139
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,483
Hey, what's going on?

140
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,138
That guy's not Homer Simpson.

141
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,557
He's fat and stupid.

142
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,645
Hey, it looks like they
changed the character

143
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,520
into a bumbling sidekick.

144
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,067
No. No, he can't be.

145
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,110
I know,
maybe he's just acting stupid

146
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,574
to infiltrate a gang
of international idiots.

147
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,065
Yeah, that's got to be it.

148
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,537
<i>You destroyed that drug shipment?</i>

149
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,538
Yes, indeed-y.

150
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,040
That was my insulin.

151
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,712
Uh-oh, spaghettio's!

152
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,881
CHIEF: <i>Simpson!</i>

153
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,920
Hey, Homer,
that character's you all over.

154
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,926
Come on, Homer, act all stupid
like you do on TV.

155
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,089
Yeah, come on, dum-dum,

156
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,547
do something unintelligent there.

157
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,467
(all laughing)

158
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,765
Shut up! I'm not your clown!

159
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,229
Don't diminish me!

160
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,441
Gentlemen, I bid you fare--
(groans)

161
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:22,021
(all laughing)

162
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,608
(groaning)

163
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,493
-(yells)
-(car screeches and crashes)

164
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,990
HOMER: Ow!
(groans)

165
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,953
Geez, what an exit.

166
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,953
Oh, man, what's he going
to do for an encore?

167
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,500
Woo...

168
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,290
I don't think he'll be doing
no encores for a while.

169
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,504
(laughs)

170
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,627
I can't understand what happened.

171
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,465
Why did they change
Homer Simpson's character

172
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,590
from cool to stupid?

173
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,797
The first episode
was just a pilot, dad.

174
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,348
Producers fiddle with shows
all the time.

175
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,101
They change characters,
drop others

176
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,693
and push some
into the background.

177
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:02,358
Your character provides
the comic relief, like, oh...

178
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,610
Marlon Brando in <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

179
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,282
Wish I hadn't bought
a hundred of these.

180
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,072
LENNY (whispering):
Get ready, everybody.

181
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,448
He's about to do something stupid.

182
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,246
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you, gentlemen

183
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,460
but you seem to have me
confused with a character

184
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,130
in a fictional show.

185
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,709
Now, if you'll excuse me
my fondue is just about...

186
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,924
D'oh!

187
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,715
(laughing)

188
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,128
LENNY: There goes Albany.

189
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,087
Uh-oh, spaghettio's!

190
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,142
Oh, man.

191
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,272
(horn honking)

192
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,139
OTTO: Whoa,
it's that Homer Simpson dude.

193
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,346
Ha-ha!

194
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,265
People are laughing at me, Marge.

195
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,074
Let's get out of here.
Forget the baby's medicine.

196
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,898
But her forehead's on fire.

197
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,493
Fine. I'll be in the car...

198
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,068
driving home.

199
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,493
Well, if it isn't
that stupid cop from TV.

200
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,913
Ah, yeah, that got it.

201
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,333
That's Homer Simpson.

202
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,501
(all clamoring)

203
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,830
WOMAN: Let's crowd him.

204
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,785
Your catchphrase is hysterical.

205
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,495
Please say it clearly
for my answering machine tape.

206
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,336
(weakly)
Uh-oh, spaghettio's.

207
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,132
Worst reading ever.

208
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,046
How about an autograph?

209
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,893
-Picture, mister?
-Can I have your shoes?

210
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,299
Come on, people. Enough is enough!

211
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,388
Oh, it's never enough
not for them.

212
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,604
Once they get a taste of you

213
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,024
they want more and more and more!

214
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,103
That reminds me.

215
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,557
Do you mind if my nephew
kicks you in the belly?

216
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,977
Okay.

217
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,606
(groans)

218
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,863
Oh, the flash didn't go off!

219
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,155
You got another one in you, Josh?

220
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,043
The whole town's laughing at me.

221
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,542
Even that cat out there.

222
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,083
Bart, kill that cat.

223
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,076
BART: Okay.

224
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,627
And that big yellow flower.

225
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,841
Homer, your growing insanity
is starting to worry me.

226
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,883
Why don't you talk
to the producers of the show?

227
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,468
Maybe they'll make
your character suave again.

228
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,724
Hmm... I guess I could.

229
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,267
But while I'm gone

230
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,980
keep an eye on that weird
looking kid down there.

231
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,822
-Bart?
-Yeah, "Bart."

232
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,120
Uh, so I just want to know
how come

233
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,239
you made your Homer Simpson
character so--?

234
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,827
Stupid?

235
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,711
Well, I can assure you
it happened organically.

236
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,078
It better have.

237
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,875
The 13 of us began
with a singular vision...

238
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,339
"Titanic meets Frasier."

239
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,299
But then we found out that ABC

240
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,128
had a similar project in development

241
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,843
with Annie Potts and Jeremy Piven.

242
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,183
-Who's Jeremy Piven?
-We don't know.

243
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,549
But it scared the hell out of us.

244
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,926
So we slapped together
a cop show instead.

245
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,683
-<i>Police Cops.</i>
-No.

246
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,095
Actually It was called
<i>Badge Patrol.</i>

247
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,894
But the network idiots
didn't want a show

248
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,437
about high-tech badges
that shoot laser beams.

249
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,781
So we asked ourselves
"who's behind the badge?"

250
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,688
-Police...
-Cops...

251
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,067
<i>Police Cops.</i>

252
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,783
Yeah, but why does
the Homer Simpson character

253
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,743
have to be so stupid?

254
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,163
Oh, he's not stupid.

255
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,991
He's a street-smart
fish out of water

256
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,697
in a world he never made.

257
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,117
I'm begging you. I'm a human being.

258
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,416
Let me have my dignity back.

259
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,000
ALL: Mm-hmm.

260
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:10,884
D'oh!

261
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,514
<i>Let me down, Chief.</i>
<i>I'm begging you!</i>

262
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:19,930
<i>I'm a human being.</i>
<i>Let me have my dignity back.</i>

263
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,432
Yow!

264
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,104
Now he's stupid and whiny.

265
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,182
That does it.

266
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,686
There's only one thing I can do.

267
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,273
Your honor, I'd like to sue

268
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,015
the producers of <i>Police Cops</i>

269
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,187
for $20 million for improper use
of my name.

270
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,486
Court finds in favor
of <i>Police Cops.</i>

271
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,610
Next case.

272
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,367
(mumbling)

273
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,579
Then I'd like
to legally change my name.

274
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,910
What name would you prefer?

275
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,294
Any of these will be fine.

276
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:50,841
Hmm, "Hercules Rockefeller.
Rembrandt Q. Einstein.

277
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,378
Handsome B. Wonderful"?

278
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,712
I'm going to give you the only name

279
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,127
you spelled correctly.

280
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,375
From this day forward,
your name shall be...

281
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,217
"Max Power"?

282
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,052
Dynamic, isn't it?

283
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,218
I love it, Max.

284
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,135
You changed your name
without consulting me?

285
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,225
That's the way
Max Power is, Marge.

286
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:12,190
Decisive, uncompromising and rude.

287
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,983
Oh, wait a minute.

288
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,236
The family name is
my legacy to you.

289
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:21,239
I got it from my father,
and he got it from his father

290
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,873
and he traded a mule for it.

291
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,661
And that mule went on
to save spring break.

292
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,668
But this will be so confusing.

293
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,880
The mailman
won't know what to do.

294
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,710
Did you think of the mailman
at all before you did this?

295
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:36,836
Yes, briefly.

296
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,722
And what about the tattoo
on my you-know-what?

297
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,470
Oh, honey, they have acids
that can burn that off.

298
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:47,104
But I fell in love
with Homer Simpson.

299
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,943
I don't want to snuggle
with Max Power.

300
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,729
Nobody snuggles with Max Power.

301
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,612
You strap yourself in
and feel the Gs!

302
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,860
Oh, Lord.

303
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,821
And it doesn't stop
in the bedroom. Oh, no.

304
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,282
I'm taking charge.

305
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,951
Kids, there's three
ways to do things...

306
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,451
The right way, the wrong way

307
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,282
and the Max Power way.

308
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,447
Isn't that the wrong way?

309
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,405
Yeah, but faster.

310
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,083
D'oh!

311
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,874
We should really put that
in the corner.

312
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,053

Ah! Max Power.
How's every little thing?

321
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,913
You remembered my name!

322
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,791
Well, who could forget the name

323
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,998
of a magnetic individual
like you?

324
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,409
Keep up the good work, Max.

325
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,577
"Mr. Power."

326
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,075
Yes, of course."Mr. Power."

327
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:02,759
So I want the monogram
to read "M-A-X-P-O-W..."

328
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,432
Sir, traditionally,
a monogram is just initials.

329
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,142
Max Power doesn't abbreviate.

330
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,482
Each letter is as important
as the one that preceded it.

331
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:15,152
Maybe more important...
No, as important.

332
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,309
(sighing)
Very well.

333
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,267
And if you got enough room

334
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,476
add exclamation points
and a pirate flag.

335
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,282
The man knows what he likes.

336
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,360
Just taking care of business.

337
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,114
If you don't, who will, huh?

338
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,486
Trent Steel.

339
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,783
Homer Sim... Uh, Max Power.

340
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,737
Ooh, hey! Great name!

341
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,407
Yeah, isn't it?
I got it off a hair dryer.

342
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,632
(chuckling) I like a man
who can poke fun at himself.

343
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,669
Ooh, hey, my 01:00 canceled.
Have you had any lunch?

344
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,763
Yeah, but I usually have
three or four.

345
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,879
So where to eat? You like Thai?

346
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,546
Tie good. You like shirt?

347
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,144
Marge, this is Thai food.

348
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,352
From now on, I want it
morning, noon and night.

349
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,483
When did you start
liking Thai food?

350
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,440
When Trent Steel bought me some.

351
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,860
Who's Trent Steel?

352
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,148
He's Max Power's
oldest and dearest friend.

353
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,822
What's this wrapped
in a banana leaf?

354
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,821
(sniffing)
Mmm... smells like mint.

355
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,914
-Oh, I spit my gum in there.
-Eeww.

356
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,739
Where'd you meet
this Trent Steel... Moe's?

357
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,785
No way. This guy's a winner.

358
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,289
He has a company
that makes computers.

359
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,210
Or a computer
that makes companies.

360
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,420
Anyway, you wouldn't understand.

361
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,789
Well, I guess your new name

362
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,046
is really opening doors for you.

363
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,628
For all of us... look.

364
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:27,764
"You are invited
to a garden party this Saturday."

365
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,353
This is our chance to rub elbows

366
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,428
with Springfield's young,
hip, power couples

367
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,354
like me and Debbie Pinson.

368
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,643
(grunting)

369
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,149
Wow! Look at this place.

370
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,824
The house number
is spelled out with letters.

371
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,204
Get used to it, honey.

372
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,660
From now one,
we'll be spelling everything

373
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,621
with letters.

374
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,831
Did you wish me to destroy
this machine for you?

375
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:57,794
Nah. Just park it.

376
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,503
Very well.

377
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,213
And I counted the pennies
in the ashtray!

378
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,674
(music playing)

379
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,264
Oh, look!
It's Woody Harrelson!

380
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,433
(laughing) I can't believe those pants

381
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,102
are made entirely out of hemp.

382
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,350
And there's Ed Begley, Jr!

383
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:19,853
...and this one solar collector
can gather enough energy

384
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,727
to run this colorful pinwheel.

385
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,240
Wait... wait, I got it, I got it.

386
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,856
Very nice, Ed.

387
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,868
Your inventions
continue to impress me

388
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,580
and the entire nation.

389
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,174
Marge... President Clinton.

390
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,839
Oh, my Lord!
I feel like Cinderella!

391
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,129
Me, too. Let's sing
the Cinderella song.

392
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,303
Eh, maybe later.

393
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,881
(gulping)

394
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,426
Uh-oh. Here comes Lorne Michaels.

395
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,469
Pretend you don't see him.

396
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,972
Ah, Max Power.

397
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,394
Trent said I absolutely must
meet you. This is fabulous--

398
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,394
(loudly) Anyway, Marge...

399
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,475
How do you feel
about the economy?

400
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,444
(Homer laughing)

401
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,652
So I said if this
is the house of pancakes

402
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,284
how come I can't eat the walls?

403
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,110
(others laughing)

404
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,741
Oh, you are too much, Max.

405
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,913
I thought I knew
all the players in Springfield.

406
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,453
Where have you been
hiding yourself?

407
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,906
Well, I spend a lot of time
on the couch.

408
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,037
(chuckling)
Tell me about it.

409
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,293
Haven't we all?

410
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,804
I know you don't think
you're good enough for me,

411
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,469
but believe me... you are.

412
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,088
Hell, I've done it with pigs...

413
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,965
(chuckling)
Real no-foolin' pigs.

414
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,932
Are you sure it's a federal law

415
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,353
that I have to dance with you?

416
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,811
You know, I'd change that law
if I could, Marge,

417
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,482
but... I can't.

418
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,730
(whispering)

419
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:46,651
Aw, shoot.
Quebec's got the bomb.

420
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,902
Well, I got to go

421
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,783
but, look, if you're ever
near the white house

422
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,900
there's a tool-shed out back.

423
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,487
I'm in there most of the day.

424
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,162
(clicking tongue)

425
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,200
Attention, please. Attention.

426
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,954
Um, I just want to say how
thrilled I am with this turnout.

427
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,408
I'm proud to share my home

428
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,328
with Springfield's
best and brightest.

429
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,086
Hey, no problem.

430
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,338
We've all been blessed
with privilege and success.

431
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,011
Whoo! Privilege!

432
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,930
Uh, but with privilege
comes grave responsibility.

433
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,100
(spitting)
What?!

434
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,428
We all have to give
something back

435
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,184
to the world that's been
so good to us.

436
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:24,345
Give something back?
Boo! Get a haircut!

437
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,186
I'm talking, of course,
about our endangered forests.

438
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,193
(murmuring agreement)

439
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,395
What's happening in the forest?

440
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,735
We have to protect them

441
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,490
because trees can't protect
themselves...

442
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,832
Except, of course,
the Mexican fighting trees.

443
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,198
Somebody buy this guy a tree
so he'll shut up.

444
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,655
Can we let
the wanton destruction

445
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,576
of our nation's forests continue?

446
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,615
ALL: No!

447
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,537
If a tree falls in the forest,
will you make a sound?

448
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,457
ALL: Yes!

449
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,125
To the protest bus!

450
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,673
(all cheering)

451
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,086
Hey, stop shoving!

452
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,724
I'm Max Power.

453
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,261
(sobbing)
What's going on, Trent?

454
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,304
Where are you taking me?

455
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,717
We're going to try and save
some beautiful redwoods.

456
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,729
(screaming)

457
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,639
Aren't you coming, Ed?

458
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,977
I prefer a vehicle
that doesn't hurt mother Earth.

459
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:11,783
It's a go-cart powered by my
own sense of self-satisfaction.

460
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,833
Oh, this is the worst party ever.

461
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,042
I don't know...

462
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,292
Remember that new year's
eve at Lenny's?

463
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,754
He didn't even have a clock.

464
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,044
Oh, Marge,
I thought it would be fun

465
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,258
to be on Springfield's "A" list,
but these people are nuts.

466
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,179
You can't blame them
for having a social conscience.

467
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,549
Sure you can.
Bunch of no-good do-gooders.

468
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,847
Hang in there, Max.

469
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,850
Saving the environment
is a hard, grueling job.

470
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,773
That's what I am saying.

471
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,232
See, Marge? This guy gets it.

472
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:52,072
(siren blaring)

473
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,779
All right,
what's going on here?

474
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,449
We can't allow you to destroy
these beautiful trees

475
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,948
which have the same
rights you have.

476
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,370
Man, I have really had it
with you tree-huggers.

477
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,200
(chuckling)
"Tree-huggers".

478
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,325
Something funny, nature boy?

479
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,501
No. I just thought it was
cute when you called them--

480
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,081
Yeah, all right, Max Power.

481
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,706
Eddie, swab this joker's eyes
with mace.

482
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,053
"Swab"?
I thought it was a spray.

483
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,759
-Okay, she's second.
-Hmm?

484
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,215
(nervous sobbing)

485
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,558
Don't give them the satisfaction
of screaming, Max.

486
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,139
-It'll only burn for--
-(Homer screaming)

487
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,730
Hey, hold still.

488
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,269
Keep running, Max!

489
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,773
I can't lose him!

490
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:31,904
Help him out, Lou.

491
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,439
Uh, you better call
for backup, Chief.

492
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:36,939
Just leave me alone!

493
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,321
Go swab Begley. He likes it.

494
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,949
Slow down, punk!

495
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,945
Uh-oh.

496
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,164
I'm free! Whoo-hoo!

497
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,501
(screech)

498
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,093
Oh, no...

499
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,925
(rumbling)

500
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,510
(siren blares and fades)

501
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,723
Mmm, what a tragedy.

502
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,177
That car was just two days away
from retirement.

503
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,478
(all gasping)

504
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,444
This is terrible.

505
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,862
Uh, so, Trent...

506
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,534
where's the party bus
headed now?

507
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,525
What?

508
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,793
Well, I'm glad you
changed your name back

509
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,448
to Homer Simpson.

510
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,707
Yes... I learned
you got to be yourself.

511
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,960
-Good night, honey.
-Good night.

512
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,132
(click)

513
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,670
Oh, I almost forgot--

514
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,633
While I was at the courthouse
I had them change your name.

515
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,795
To what?

516
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:41,802
Chesty LaRue.

517
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,143
Chesty LaRue?

518
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,718
Just try it for two weeks.

519
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,473
If you're not
completely satisfied

520
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,715
you can be Busty St. Claire.

521
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,176
I don't want to be Chesty LaRue

522
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,017
or Busty St. Claire.

523
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,652
-Fine. Hooty McBoob it is.
-Good night, Homer.

524
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,984
HOMER: <i>Sleep tight, Hooty.</i>

525
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,567
MARGE: <i>Let go of those.</i>

526
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,400
HOMER: <i>Heh-heh-heh...</i>

527
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,195
(theme music playing)

528
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,236
Shh.
