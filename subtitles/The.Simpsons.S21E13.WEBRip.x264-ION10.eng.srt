Actually, I'm here
to help you.

184
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,344
-Follow me north to freedom.
-I don't think so.

185
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,383
Why? Because I'm young
and I'm a woman?

186
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,047
No, because you're
pointing south.

women only express
their opinions in diaries

342

to be found
long after they're gone.

343
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,948
From the day you were born,
you were brought up

344
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,370
to crave the approval
of a man.

345
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,079
And I know you really want
to be a good girl,

346

Now, where's my man?

351
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:24,916
In the turnip shed.

352
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,007
Now, what's my surprise?

353
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,801
Your surprise is
a new pair of shoes.

354
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,136
Oh, my God,
that surprise
is so pleasant.

355

even look at Eliza again."

358
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,400
It didn't help
that the next day,

359
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,645
he drank bad well water
and went blind.

360
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,987
No! You lie!

361
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,742
Eliza Simpson can't be a coward.

362
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,294
(voice breaking):
She's the only decent
ancestor I have.

363
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,039
Ach. Take it outside, lassie.

364
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,041
We've still got three
"Jackie Robinsons"

365
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,833
and a "Tuskegee Airmen" to go.

366
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,378
-(crying)
-And so many Obamas.

367
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,921
-(all impersonating Obama)
-Yes, we can.

368
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,134
-Audacity of hope.
-Let me be clear.

369
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,064
As I told you,
we don't have any books

371
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,182
But I need to prove
that my ancestor

372
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,397
couldn't have backed down
to Colonel Burns.

373
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,688
Colonel Burns?

374
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,981
Why, I haven't heard

Huh?

378
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,033
We have a film vault?

379
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,325
It's where we hooked up
during the Christmas party.

380
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,659
Oh.

Oh, you were right, Dad.

393
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,280
I should have quit
while I was ahead

394
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,822

the horrible truth

395
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,315
about our family

396

Aw, don't cry, meat pie.

397
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,120
Things worked out pretty well
for Virgil in the end.

398
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,786
What are you talking about?

399
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,125
Is there something
you know about Virgil

400
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,789
that you haven't told us?

401
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,878
I'll take that secret
to my grave--

402
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,843
or urn, or medical school
dissecting table,

403
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:31,934
or wherever you're dumping me.

404
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,799
Listen, Wrinkles,

405
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,386
if you know something that'll
cheer up my little girl,

406
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,061
you'd better spill it.

407
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,679
Or I can make things
very uncomfortable for you.

408
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:42,767
That enough?

409
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,903
Ah! Okay, I'll talk.

410
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,030
D-day is June 6th.
Repeat: June 6th.

411
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,688
Allied forces will land

412

Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno.

413
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,411
Are you writing this down,

414
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,741
About Virgil.

415
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,985
Oh, right.

416
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,287
Well, Lisa, Mabel
knew her husband well,

417
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,921
<i>so she had cooked up</i>
<i>a little payback pie.</i>

418

419
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,919
Get off my property,
Colonel Burns.

420
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,094
And if I ever see you

422
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,131
...you're gonna be
a Memphis belle.

423
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,760
Very well.
You may have won this round,

424
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,927

will be told

425
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,806
by my descendants
Ken and Ric Burns.

426
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,897
I knew you'd break
your promise.

427
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,901
Now I'm taking
Virgil to freedom.

428
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,533
You defied your

429
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,531
Man, this <i>is </i>the '60s.

430
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,283

431

00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,102
Mabel, why don't I go on alone,
and you go back to Hiram?

438
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,218
No.

439
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,814
There's no life
for me with him.

440
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,639
I just need
to disguise my hair.

441
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:03,814
But how?

442
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,892
May I be of assistance?

00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,358
Abraham Lincoln?

444
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,688
Perhaps this hat will
help disguise your hair.

445
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,484
Thank you.

446
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,778
