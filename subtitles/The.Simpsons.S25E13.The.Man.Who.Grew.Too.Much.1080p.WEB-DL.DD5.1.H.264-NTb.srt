But how did you

322
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:13,642
Calder's work in this period
was marked by heavy use

323

to look deceptively airy.

Well... there is something
I should have told you.

328
00:15:22,651 --> 00:15:27,186
You see, it occurred to me that if I can
genetically modify fruits and vegetables,

329
00:15:27,215 --> 00:15:29,817
why can't I modify... me?!

330
00:15:29,877 --> 00:15:32,437
You've been
changing your DNA?!

331
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:36,537
Well, at first, just a
peptide here and there.

332
00:15:36,564 --> 00:15:39,876
Carrot for my presbyopia,
Brahma bull for strength,

333

341
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:10,818
Do you know why we came
to the museum today?

342
00:16:10,855 --> 00:16:14,552
Well, I thought it was
because it was Tote Bag Day.

343
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:18,752
Well, that was part of it, but
the biggest part was <i>that!</i>

I'll have to clip around her moral fiber.

347
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:31,218
You're going to take DNA from these
historical figures and add it to your own!

348
00:16:31,248 --> 00:16:33,875
I shall be the wisest
and strongest maniac

349
00:16:33,888 --> 00:16:37,271
ever to bring the blessings
of dictatorship to the world!

BART:
Jig's up, Bob!

351
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:43,239
Return the spear to
the <i>Homo erectus.</i>

352
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,503
(laughing):
<i>Homo erectus?</i>

353
00:16:45,523 --> 00:16:47,787
Where has that word
been all my life?

354
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:50,158
Now, Bart, I promised
I wouldn't hurt you.

355
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:53,547
- You did that for me?
- More for Mom, but yes.

356
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,475
But beware, I have DNA in me from
<i>Ophiocordyceps unilateralis,</i>

357
00:16:57,501 --> 00:17:02,623
better known as...
zombie ant fungus!

358
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,888
And we're scared of
that because...?

359
00:17:06,911 --> 00:17:09,112
What I am saying is,
I could be tipped

360
00:17:09,146 --> 00:17:11,339
into a murderous rage by
the slightest provocation.

361
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,542
Could you take a picture
of me with my family?

362
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:15,058
Mm-hmm.

363
00:17:15,592 --> 00:17:17,987
Oh, would you take
another for safety?

364
00:17:18,355 --> 00:17:20,568
Oh, I think my eyes
were shut in that one.

00:17:22,326 --> 00:17:24,433
Now, can you take one
with my husband's camera?

367
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:26,715
They're all ugly because
you're in them!

Uh, Chief, we got a report
of a disturbance at the Met.

375
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,282
We got bigger
problems, Lou.

376
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:49,151
Horny teens who should
be out having bad sex,

377
00:17:49,177 --> 00:17:54,366
but instead somebody made them take an
abstinence pledge, by the looks of it.

378
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:59,221
I don't get it. There are taboos about
premarital sex in the Middle East,

379
00:17:59,241 --> 00:18:02,221
and you don't see those
people getting all violent.

A little singing?

genetically enhance, it's his voice.
