{\an8}Tonight on
"Eye on Springfield"--

7
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,960
{\an8}Opening day at the world's
first two-story outhouse.

8
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,924
{\an8}MAN: Oh, God! Stop!

00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:49,223
{\an8}A comedy nurse who's laughing
all the way to the blood bank.

10
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:53,509
{\an8}Okay, how many of you are here
for shoulder surgery, huh?

00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,805
{\an8}(people groaning)

12
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,099
{\an8}Gotcha!

13
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,932
{\an8}But first,
move over, Baltimore.

14
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,728
{\an8}Springfield
has stolen your idea.

15
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,612
{\an8}I'm walking
on the waterfront--

16
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:07,479
{\an8}Once the center of a thriving
squid-gutting industry,

17
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,937
{\an8}now abandoned by all
but a few longshoremen

18
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,608
{\an8}and allied tradespeople.

19
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,736
{\an8}But the decades of rot will end

20
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,243
{\an8}with the opening
of the South Street Squidport,

21
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,656
{\an8}an upscale
shopping promenade

22
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,954
{\an8}with authentic
maritime theming.

23
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,869
And to kick it all off in style

24
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,957
area merchants will host
a black-tie gala Saturday night.

25
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,005
Ooh, that sounds
fabulous, Homer.

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,800
{\an8}Stores throw
the best parties.

27
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,643
{\an8}You like parties, huh?

28
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,798
{\an8}Well, I just remembered
they're having a big one

29
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,807
{\an8}down at the waterfront
this weekend.

30
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,019
{\an8}You didn't
remember that.

31
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,599
{\an8}You just saw it on TV.

32
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,853
{\an8}The important thing
is I didn't imagine it.

33
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,229
{\an8}I can't get enough
of "The BabySitter Twins."

34
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,975
{\an8}They arrested
the counterfeiters,

35
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,647
{\an8}rescued the president
and made four dollars.

36
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,907
I love everything about
the world of baby-sitting--

37
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:58,539
The responsibility,
the obligation, the pressure...

38
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,868
And full refrigerator
privileges.

39
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,924
That's a trust, Janey,
a sacred trust.

40
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,788
jeez, lighten up, Lisa.

41
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,876
{\an8}(organ plays)

42
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,462
LOVEJOY:
That concludes our service.

43
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,378
All right, I have
two announcements.

44
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,796
Friday you will have the chance

45
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,554
to party down
in the church basement

46
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,597
to the Jesus rock
stylings of Testament.

47
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,272
That's Friday,
6 p.m. sharp.

48
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,401
All the best bands are
affiliated with Satan.

49
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,479
Also, anyone in need of a reliable
and affordable baby-sitter

50
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,487
should call
Lisa Simpson.

51
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,649
Mention the topic
of today's sermon

52
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,697
to get a dollar off.

53
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,621
(man coughing)

54
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,871
(clearing throat)

55
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,122
The topic was love.

56
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,710
Why hasn't anyone called?

57
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,340
Maybe people don't want an
eight-year-old baby-sitter, honey.

58
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,129
Parents need to be sure

59
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,302
their sitter can handle
anything that might happen.

60
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,381
That's why they hire teenagers.

61
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,756
But, but I'm very
mature for my age.

62
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,184
People often
mistake me for nine.

63
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,723
(doorbell chimes)

64
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:05,886
Homer, I've got a Fozzie
of a bear of a problem.

65
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,687
That Maude and her mother
were visiting Tyre and Sidon,

66
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,151
the twin cities
of the holy land.

67
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,401
They must have kneeled
in the wrong place

68
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,652
and prayed to
the wrong god

69
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,945
because, well, they're being held prisoner
by militants of some sort.

70
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,820
Militants, huh? Well, if I were you,
I'd kick their asses.

71
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,778
Well, any hoodily-doodle,
the embassy says

72
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,288
it's just a routine
hostage taking

73
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,709
but I have to drive
to Capitol City,

74
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,998
fill out some forms
to get them out.

75
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,131
Could you possibly
watch the kids tonight?

76
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,749
Oh, gee, I'd really love
to want to help you, Flanders

77
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,967
but, uh... Marge was...

78
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,679
Taken prisoner in, uh...

79
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,011
Holy land, and, uh...

80
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,385
I'll do it!
I'll baby-sit!

81
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,473
Well, I don't know, Lisa.

82
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,847
You're awfully young,

83
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,944
and the boys
can be a handful.

84
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,309
Todd's been pinching
everyone lately.

85
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,766
But I'm smart and responsible

86
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,976
and my parents
will be right next door.

87
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,027
Well, what do
you say, Homer?

88
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,570
Can Lisa baby-sit
for my kids?

89
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,574
Please, please,
please?

90
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,195
Well, I'll have to ask her.

91
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:06,995
Where are the dice?

92
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,710
Daddy says dice are wicked.

93
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,791
We just move
one space at a time.

94
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,456
It's less fun that way.

95
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,761
-Moth! Moth!
-Moth! Moth!

96
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,968
Moth-moth-moth!

97
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,429
Don't worry.

98
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,219
A moth is no more harmful
than a ladybug.

99
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,762
-A ladybug?
-A ladybug?

100
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,805
(both screaming)

101
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,350
Uh, they're going to get
eaten alive in middle school.

102
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,845
And thank you
for sending Lisa

103
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,147
to protect us
from the bug you sent.

104
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:37,741
And please make Lisa
tell us a bedtime story...

105
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,609
about robots...

106
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,446
named Rod and Todd.

107
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,701
Amen.

108
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,536
Once there was
a robot named Todd...

109
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,910
Did he have a brother?

110
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,787
Yes, he had a brother
robot named Rod

111
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,674
who was two space
years older than him.

112
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,632
I don't like this story!

113
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,630
Oh, imagine that:

114
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,636
sleeping quietly
after a bug attack

115
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,889
and Todd's as
dry as a bone.

116
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,471
Lisa, you're a wonder.

117
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,266
I'm going to recommend you
to everybody.

118
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,270
So long, Lisa.

119
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:15,693
If anything goes
wrong, just dial 911.

120
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,613
Unless it's an emergency.

121
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,692
LISA:
Okay, chief. Enjoy Bob Saget.

122
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,657
Ha! It's Bob Seger.

123
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,449
Aw, crap.

124
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,912
Now, put your left leg
into the left side

125
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,793
of the pants
and you're done.

126
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,660
I dressed myself.

127
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,746
Hey, Dad. How come you're
wearing a tuxedo?

128
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,625
Going to that fancy
waterfront party tomorrow.

129
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,133
Why are you wearing it now?

130
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,724
It's like a rent-a-car, son.

131
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,889
You get all the mileage you can,
then ball it up

132
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,849
and cram it through
the mail slot.

133
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,725
(car door slams)

134
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,728
LISA:
Thanks for the ride.

135
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,980
You did a first-rate
job of baby-sitting.

136
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,323
I've never seen such
a responsible young lady.

137
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,898
Thank you, Dr. Hibbert.

138
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,783
Your trust means so much to me.

139
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,820
I only wish my Volvo
mechanic were as reliable.

140
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,905
(chuckling)

141
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,199
Good night, Lisa.

142
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,036
You made all that money

143
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:16,082
for sitting around and
watching TV and eating food?

144
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,087
There's a lot more
to it than that, Bart.

145
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,629
I don't just baby-sit.

146
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,472
I sell peace of mind
for a dollar an hour.

147
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,298
Two dollars after 9:00.

148
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,094
Man, if I was making
that kind of money

149
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,717
I'd be out of
here so fast...

150
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,894
(giggles)

151
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,936
LISA:
You look so glamorous, Mom.

152
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,070
Oh, and you smell
like vanilla flowers.

153
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,858
Dad, you look
totally classy.

154
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,652
You could be Abe Lincoln's
father's boss.

155
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,395
Can you see the pie stains?

156
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,817
It'll be dark.

157
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,695
So, when's Grampa getting here
to baby-sit?

158
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,912
Mmm, Grampa's not coming.

159
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,042
Oh, not Patty and Selma.

160
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,210
Actually, Bart, Lisa's
going to be in charge tonight.

161
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,169
-What?
-I know she's young,

162
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,090
but Lisa has proven herself
mature and dependable.

163
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,709
Dad, help me out.

164
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,006
Take it like a man, boy,

165
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,669
and do everything
your little sister says.

166
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,177
This is an outrage.

167
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,219
I am two years and 38 days
older than she is!

168
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,762
This is the greatest injustice
in the history of the world!

169
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,267
Well, we have to run.

170
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,518
I'm sure you kids
will work things out.

171
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,639
Good night.

172
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,940
Make sure he brushes
his teeth, Lisa.

173
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,407
Bart, I know
you're not wild

174
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,948
about having me
for a babysitter

175
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,161
but I'm not some ogre.

176
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,542
I think you will find me
fair and fun.

177
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,999
You're dead.

178
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,499
You should wash up for dinner.

179
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,711
To make it fun,
you can use the Mr. Bubble.

180
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,001
It'll be like giving
your fingers a bubble bath.

181
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,415
You are so dead.

182
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,383
(clattering)

183
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,433
Ah, I love this
pedestrian mall.

184
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,429
It's practically
no traffic.

185
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,551
(honking horn)

186
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,597
(gasping)

187
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,181
Mmm. I don't think
we should be driving here.

188
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,307
The mayor's yelling at us.

189
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,404
MAN:
Stop, you idiots!

190
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,939
All right, all right.

191
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,482
Jeez.

192
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,435
Okay, honey, remember
where we're parked.

193
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,079
May I have some more
lima beans, please?

194
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,251
Certainly.

195
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,249
More than that.

196
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,830
Certainly.

197
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,205
More.

198
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,211
More.
More.

199
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,094
Maybe you should eat
the ones you have.

200
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,051
I didn't say I was
going to eat them.

201
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,471
I just wanted
to look at them

202
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,629
because they're
so gross.

203
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,387
What's for dessert?

204
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,599
Bart, if you don't want
to have a baby-sitter,

205
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,179
maybe you should stop
being such a baby.

206
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,845
Oh, I'm a baby, huh?

207
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,644
Well, then,
I'll act like a baby.

208
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,097
Ga-ga-goo-goo.

209
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,018
Even babies know how to open
and close their mouths.

210
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,027
You need a bib.

211
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,738
Oh, baby hate bib.

212
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,199
Waah! Waah!
Waaah! Waaah!

213
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,490
(crying)

214
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,034
Oh, look, Bart.

215
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,487
Now you got Maggie
all upset.

216
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,407
Relax. I'll give her
some ice cream.

217
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,456
(slurping)

218
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,456
Bart, that's
coffee ice cream.

219
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,424
It has
caffeine in it.

220
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,344
Well, I guess that'll make
things more interesting

221
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,842
for you now,
won't it?

222
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,969
Ooh! It's so beautiful.

223
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,266
This is what I imagine
Paris must be like.

224
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,850
You've never been?

225
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,055
I'm so honored that Springfield
has been chosen

226
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,435
to host all these
upscale chain stores.

227
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,153
I guess this makes us
yuppies, huh, Homie?

228
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,324
Nah, I'm really
more of a slacker.

229
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,323
Ooh!

230
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,315
Malaria Zone.

231
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,277
That's where all
the explorers shop.

232
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,577
Look, Marge!

233
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,290
A restaurant owned
by celebrities.

234
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,541
I always wanted
to be a celebrity.

235
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,669
Ha-ha! Yes, it's true.

236
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:50,301
The entire menu was personally
approved by my secretary.

237
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,051
Isn't that clever?

238
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,803
It looks like a Cadillac
drove right into the building.

239
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,135
Help me.

240
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,270
Wow. Even Moe's moved
to fancy new digs.

241
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,863
Hey, this isn't
faux dive.

242
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,493
This is a dive.

243
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,200
You're a long way
from home, yuppie boy.

244
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,991
I'll start a tab.

245
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:21,954
Maggie, if you come down,
I'll give you some more coffee.

246
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,208
Lots more coffee.

247
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,080
(fast sucking sounds)

248
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,377
Are you getting ready
for bed, Bart?

249
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,001
I am!

250
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,457
That's right.

251
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,837
I want the 25-foot
Italian party sub.

252
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,554
And don't skimp
on the vinegar.

253
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,385
It's time Lisa learned

254
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,140
what baby-sitting Bart Simpson
is all about.

255
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,563
Um, yes, I'd like to host
an A.A. meeting.

256
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,555
Tonight if possible.

257
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,767
Come on, Maggie.

258
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,357
Good Maggie.

259
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:56,453
The talcum powder's
not to play with.

260
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,320
(coughing)

261
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,697
(groaning)
Ohh...

262
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:06,171
Okay, Bart now it's really time
for you to go to bed.

263
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,585
(grunting)

264
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,802
Why do you have
to make this so hard?

265
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,973
I'm using nonviolent resistance.

266
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,722
The idea that you would compare
yourself to Mahatma Gandhi...

267
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,516
-Who?
-(doorbell chimes)

268
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,889
I'll answer it.

269
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:25,845
You go to bed.

270
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,688
Good evening
there, miss.

271
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,234
Here's your giant sub

272
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,697
swimming in vinegar
just the way you like it.

273
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,698
It's going to be
$225 plus tip.

274
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,491
What? I didn't order
any giant sub.

275
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,985
(doorbell chimes)

276
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,947
Hey, hey!

277
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,577
Are you ready to get rowdy?

278
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,374
Excuse me?

279
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,997
Somebody hired me for an emergency
bachelor party.

280
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,205
Well, there's been a mistake.

281
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,545
Well, I'm not leaving
till I get paid.

282
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,432
I get 500 just
for "Hey, hey."

283
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,049
(siren wailing)

284
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,006
Who called for an emergency
sisterectomy?

285
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,636
(growls)

286
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,563
(shutter clicks)

287
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,771
(doorbell chimes)

288
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,101
We got a report

289
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,595
that a Lisa Simpson
spotted a U.F.O.

290
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,768
I didn't see any U.F.O.!

291
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,317
That's right, miss.

292
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,690
You didn't.

293
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,283
I'm here to pick up
the ambassador from Ghana.

294
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,624
Well, he's not here!
Nobody's here!

295
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,950
None of you
should be here!

296
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,664
You've all been tricked!

297
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,995
Why would the ambassador
do such a thing?

298
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
This is ridiculous.

299
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,205
I'm going to
bill them later.

300
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,091
Bart, you are going to be

301
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,049
in so much trouble when
Mom and Dad get home.

302
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,470
Now, go to bed!

303
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,968
You're the boss.

304
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,598
(groans)

305
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,808
I thought I told
you to go to bed.

306
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,389
Yeah, right. Bread.

307
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,184
You said go to "bread."

308
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,637
I said go to bed.

309
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,398
Yeah, go to "bread."

310
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,650
B-E-D! Bed!

311
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,902
Oh... Bed.

312
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,025
Oh.

313
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,451
Well, anything
you say, sis.

314
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,412
You didn't say which bed.

315
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,036
Go to your bed!

316
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,212
-Make me.
-I'll make you.

317
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,206
If you want me,
you got to catch me.

318
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,963
(snarls)

319
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,005
-Almost.
-(snarls)

320
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,418
-Oh, so close.
-Bart!

321
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,138
(grunting)

322
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,972
Son of a--

323
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,934
Oh, my God.

324
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,097
Okay, we'll call it even

325
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,146
if I can just have some
of that big sandwich.

326
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,900
Oh...

327
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,731
I'll come back.

328
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,324
Bart, are you okay?

329
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,866
Ohh. Yeah, I think so.

330
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:50,081
It's just a bump
on my head.

331
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,292
Ew, your arm.

332
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,872
It's got extra
corners.

333
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,457
Yah! Oh, cool.

334
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,253
It must be dislocated
or something.

335
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,456
We have to get you
to the emergency room.

336
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,087
And get this fixed?
What's the rush?

337
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,344
Don't you want
everyone to see

338
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,425
what a responsible
baby-sitter you were?

339
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,891
Stop it. Stand still.

340
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,352
Maybe I can pop it back in.

341
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,681
No, I'm going to preserve
the evidence

342
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,847
until Mom and Dad get home.

343
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,806
And you'll never
baby-sit again!

344
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,858
(door slams, locks)

345
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,731
You know, honey

346
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,778
when I think of all the good
times we've had together...

347
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,532
Yeow!

348
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,163
Did you see that, Marge?

349
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,280
Oh, my God, you walked
into the fountain.

350
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,117
Get out of
the fountain!

351
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,202
(shrieking)

352
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,657
I can't get out.

353
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,996
Just stand still
and I'll get someone.

354
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,172
I can't get out.

355
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,131
(sobbing)

356
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,264
(crowd laughing)

357
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,339
Don't laugh at me.

358
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,307
I was once like you.

359
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,428
Bart, you need first aid.

360
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,845
Let me in.

361
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,103
I'm afraid
you'll hurt me again.

362
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,895
Bart, if you come out,

363
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,019
I'll let you eat
raw cookie dough.

364
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,777
I'll let you...

365
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,239
ride the lawn mower
through the house.

366
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,780
Come on, open the door!

367
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:07,784
(pounding)

368
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,365
What are you doing now?

369
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,870
BART: I'm banging
my head.

370
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,791
I'm going to make
the lump even bigger.

371
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,790
(chuckling)

372
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,793
No! As your baby-sitter

373
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,585
I order you to stop hitting
your head on the wall!

374
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,089
(thump)

375
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,052
Bart?

376
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,973
Did you stop
because I said to?

377
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,433
If so, thank you.

378
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,854
Bart?

379
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,063
(whimpering)

380
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,443
(gasps)

381
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,685
(gasps)

382
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:44,986
(beeping)

383
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,029
WOMAN: <i>911.</i>

384
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,911
Hello, this is Lisa Simpson...

385
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,448
<i>Simpson? Look, we've already</i>
<i>been out there tonight</i>

386
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,202
<i>for a sisterectomy,</i>

387
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,794
<i>a case of severe butt-rot,</i>
<i>and a leprechaun bite.</i>

388
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,750
<i>How dumb</i>
<i>do you think we are?</i>

389
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,210
(dial tone)

390
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,790
Oh.

391
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,035
Wait. Dr. Hibbert.

392
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,852
Hmm...

393
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,730
Dislocated shoulder,
bump on the noggin.

394
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,439
My diagnosis?

395
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,729
Bad baby-sitting.

396
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,322
Well, near
as we can tell,

397
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,900
the boy was
studying quietly,

398
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,355
when the girl,

399
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,454
drunk on her
own sense of power,

400
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,030
beat him silly with a block of
frozen lima beans.

401
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,697
It's true!

402
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,825
Young lady, you will
never baby-sit again.

403
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,253
I am so disappointed.

404
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,922
(echoing)

405
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,422
Oh, well, I guess
I don't have a choice.

406
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,972
"Complete confidentiality"?

407
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,104
Oh? And I'm sure
he's as good as Dr. Hibbert.

408
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,892
{\an8}It says so
right in his ad.

409
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,859
What's
the matter, Marge?

410
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,689
I thought you loved
Jell-O shooters.

411
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,744
(slurping)

412
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,818
Oh, I do.

413
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,993
I'm just a little concerned
about the kids.

414
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,872
Maybe I should call.

415
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,909
Oh, come on,
Marge, relax.

416
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,913
Lisa's in charge.

417
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,955
She's
the responsible one.

418
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:20,999
(grunts)

419
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,541
Hold on, Bart.

420
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,594
Everything's going
to be just fine.

421
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,208
I'm going to get you
to a doctor.

422
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,045
He will fix you up.

423
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,880
And by this time tomorrow,
we'll all be a happy family.

424
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,886
Happy, happy,
happy family.

425
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,758
(babbling)

426
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,925
Maggie!

427
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:50,152
Please, Maggie.
Please go to sleep.

428
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,959
Yo, um, I must have, like,
fallen on a bullet,

429
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,711
and it, like, drove
itself into my gut.

430
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,554
Hey, don't worry.

431
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,801
You don't have
to make up stories here.

432
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,893
Save that for court.

433
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,966
Um, excuse me,
Mr. Smithers.

434
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,807
Bart may be
seriously hurt.

435
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,812
Could we possibly
go ahead of you?

436
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,654
Um... No.

437
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,149
I really would rather
get this taken care of.

438
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,982
Excuse me, little lady.

439
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,318
The wheelbarrow line
is over there.

440
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,121
Ooh, loneliness
and cheeseburgers

441
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,119
are a dangerous mix.

442
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,621
(groans)

443
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,000
(siren blaring)

444
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,673
Hold it right there.

445
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,415
Well, if it isn't
Springfield's

446
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,165
finest little baby-sitter,
Lisa Simpson.

447
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,178
-Hi. How are you?
-Um, I'm fine.

448
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,721
Now, Lisa, when
you're walking

449
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,854
down the side
of the road,

450
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,100
you always want
to be sure

451
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,601
to go with
traffic, okay?

452
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,984
Well, is that with traffic
or against traffic?

453
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:06,981
No, it's with traffic--
with traffic.

454
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,482
Anyway, good night.

455
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,364
(sighs)

456
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,030
Uh, hold on
a minute.

457
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,819
Let me have a look at
that wheelbarrow, please.

458
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,363
Okay.

459
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,874
Just as I thought.

460
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,042
It's a Yard King.

461
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,831
That is
a quality barrow.

462
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,884
Well, I got to run.

463
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,918
(engine starting)

464
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,382
(car departs)

465
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,302
Oh, God.

466
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,551
Where's Bart?

467
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,592
(gasps)

468
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,930
(Lisa moaning)

469
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,979
(moaning)

470
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,856
(grunts)

471
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,029
Oh, Bart,
I'm so sorry.

472
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,488
This is all
like a bad dream.

473
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,359
(switch clicks)

474
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,356
Citizens of Springfield,

475
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,698
I officially declare this--

476
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,833
What the hell is that?

477
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,951
Why, it's Lisa Simpson

478
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,458
and look what she's doing.

479
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,039
(crowd gasping)

480
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,634
MAN:
I don't believe it.

481
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,129
She's murdered her brother.

482
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,761
And she's trying to dump
the body in the harbor.

483
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:15,878
Well, duh.

484
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,934
And as a grim finale,

485
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,928
she intends to drown
that poor caged baby.

486
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,351
What's happening?
Where am I?

487
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,140
And she's on drugs!

488
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,064
Give me the drugs, Lisa.

489
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,942
Dad, I am
not on drugs.

490
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:29,979
I was just
trying...

491
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,312
Oh, his arm!

492
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,226
Oh, my special little guy.

493
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,435
Are you okay?

494
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:37,324
Hmm. Dislocated shoulder,

495
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,952
bump on the noggin.

496
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,949
My diagnosis?

497
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,991
A rather nasty fall...

498
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,075
caused by bad baby-sitting!

499
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,040
(crowd gasping)

500
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,791
Hey, Bart.

501
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,207
-How's your arm?
-It's all right.

502
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,296
I was hoping they'd give me
one of them steel claws,

503
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,382
but what are you going to do?

504
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,126
Hmm.

505
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:05,058
I'm... I'm sorry
I was such a jerk last night.

506
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,308
I guess I sort of ruined
your baby-sitting business.

507
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,522
Yeah, well, that's okay.

508
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,402
I can always sell seeds.

509
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,110
Do you want some seeds?

510
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,650
-No, thanks.
-Oh.

511
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:18,654
(ringing)

512
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:19,895
Hello.

513
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,567
World's worst
baby-sitter speaking.

514
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,525
<i>DR. HIBBERT: Lisa,</i>
<i>I'm glad I reached you.</i>

515
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,115
<i>Are you available</i>
<i>to baby-sit tonight?</i>

516
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,120
Aren't you afraid
I might take drugs

517
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,752
and injure your children?

518
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,369
Yes, that is a concern,

519
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,495
but it's so hard
to find a sitter,

520
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,042
and I've got judo tonight.

521
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,916
-(beep)
-Um, okay.

522
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,883
I'm sorry.
Can you hold on, please?

523
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,173

I almost killed my brother?
