(Homer groaning)

10
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,512
How much did I eat?

11
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:53,084
(groaning)

12
00:00:53,104 --> 00:00:55,639
Homie, you can't keep
doing this to yourself.

13
00:00:55,662 --> 00:00:57,742
(scoffs)
I'm as healthy as a horse.

14
00:00:57,764 --> 00:00:59,981
Horses only live 30 years.

15
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:01,281

(sighs)

17
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:06,160
If you could just ease up
on the eating after 3:00 a.m.

18
00:01:06,179 --> 00:01:08,547
That's all I ask.

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,768
Marge is right. I'm gonna walk
upstairs, take her in my arms

20
00:01:12,787 --> 00:01:15,715
and tell her my good
health starts now!

21
00:01:15,774 --> 00:01:17,087
Mm-hmm!

22
00:01:17,104 --> 00:01:19,031
Legs pumping.
Blood flowing.

23
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:21,060
Two at a time.

24
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,388

31
00:01:34,705 --> 00:01:38,075
And so we mourn the loss
of Homer J. Simpson.

32
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:43,241
Beloved husband, father and
poorly informed sports fan.

33
00:01:43,262 --> 00:01:46,369
All he did was yell
"traveling" at the screen.

34
00:01:46,385 --> 00:01:49,192
Major condolences on
your bereavement, dear.

35
00:01:49,218 --> 00:01:53,377
If, uh... you know, after a respectful
period of grief and whatnot, uh...

36
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,615
yous would like to have some
coffee, please give a call.

37
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,777
- Thank you, Moe.
- FRINK: Stop!

38
00:01:59,796 --> 00:02:02,619
Stop with the wailing and
the gnashing and the aye...

39
00:02:02,648 --> 00:02:04,488
Homer is not dead!

40
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:06,221
I have made a copy.

41
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:07,878
I'm number two.

42
00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:09,158
(moans in excitement)

43
00:02:09,177 --> 00:02:11,593
You're alive! But how?

44
00:02:11,606 --> 00:02:13,299
Uh, well...
(clears throat, speak gibberish)

45
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,133
I was able to put Homer's
memories in the body of a clone,

46
00:02:17,146 --> 00:02:19,967
identical to the
original in every way.

47
00:02:19,986 --> 00:02:23,802
I wanted to clone a sheep, but I needed
to start with something simpler.

48
00:02:23,815 --> 00:02:26,634
Which he is, because
his brain is fliveck.

49
00:02:26,651 --> 00:02:28,609
Oh... Dad, you're back!

50
00:02:28,637 --> 00:02:30,843
Just in time for
my recital.

51
00:02:30,863 --> 00:02:32,445
Somebody kill me.

52
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:36,816
Now, Homie. I hope you use this second
chance to live a more sensible life.

53
00:02:36,843 --> 00:02:39,556
Amen, baby. Did you make
potato salad for the wake?

54
00:02:39,582 --> 00:02:40,813
Yes.

55
00:02:43,135 --> 00:02:45,854
That man sure loved
potato salad.

56
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:46,688

57
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,001
Ah, hey, Midge. Uh...
here we are again, ah?

58
00:02:50,014 --> 00:02:51,048
Yeah...
(laughs)

59
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:53,793

uh, my new card.

00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,297

(laughing):
Yeah.

64
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,032
I can die all I want.

65
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:04,647
Frink's got Homers like the
Tuileries has park benches.

66
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,321
Huh? I wonder where
I picked that up.

67
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:08,261
Oh. I planted a
Western history chip,

68
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:11,213
but all you retained were
the places to sit down.

69
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,483

00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,178
Oh, Moe, are we
doing this again?

93
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:19,718
You know what? No. I'm tired
of getting my hopes up here.

94
00:04:19,731 --> 00:04:23,250
You and your immortal husband
can go take a flying leap, huh?

95
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:29,454
Um, I am so very sorry, but, uh, this time,
I could not bring Homer back to life.

96
00:04:29,487 --> 00:04:30,760
ALL:
Wha...?

97
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:32,286
(groans)
Stupid Moe.

98
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:36,439
You just had to act like yourself,
didn't you, you jackass?

99
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:39,804
All is not lost.

100
00:04:39,824 --> 00:04:44,948
I was able to download Homer's brain
into this flash drive. It'll have to do.

101
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:46,318
Yo. Where's my body?

102
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:50,762
Oh, you used up all your clones, you
fat, fat, fat, reckless, fat pig!

103
00:04:50,782 --> 00:04:52,978
From now on, you're just going
to be a face on a monitor.

104
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:55,559
So, enjoy screen
saver mode!

105
00:04:56,216 --> 00:04:58,569
Bonk. Bonk. Bonk.

106
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,825
Ooh. Corner. Ba-donk.

107
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:02,534
Let me just say this once.

108
00:05:02,556 --> 00:05:04,903
(screams)

109
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:06,920
I'm good.

110
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:15,697
Hey, kids. Want to chase Grandpa
Homer around the house?

111
00:05:15,735 --> 00:05:16,912
- I do!
- Yay!

112
00:05:16,938 --> 00:05:18,959
(Homer and kids giggling)

113
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:27,570
After 35 years of wifely obedience,
I'm married to a face on a screen.

114
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:30,128
Not exactly fun and games
for me, either, Marge.

115
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:31,545

00:05:37,826 --> 00:05:39,466
How are you, Milhouse?

121
00:05:39,487 --> 00:05:41,640
Things aren't
great with Lisa.

122
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,501
If it wasn't for that squirrel
that eats our bird food,

123
00:05:44,521 --> 00:05:46,554
we'd have nothing
to talk about.

124
00:05:46,574 --> 00:05:48,604
As I told you when we
talked last month,

125
00:05:48,643 --> 00:05:51,461
"I've been doing a lot of
charity work for the undead."

126
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,236
HOMER:
Uh, Marge, excuse me.

127
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:54,957
Uh... I think I
need a reboot.

128
00:05:54,983 --> 00:05:59,124
Just stick the tip of your pen in that
little hole and hold it for 15 minutes.

129
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,186
(click)

130
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,000
No. I'm throwing you
out of the house.

131
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:03,673
You can live with
your no-good son.

132
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:06,607
- Hey. What did I do?
- Nothing for 30 years.

133
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:08,247
You're perfect
for each other.

134
00:06:08,276 --> 00:06:10,383
No. No. No. Don't pull me
out before you click eject.

135
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,110
That hurts like
a mother...!

136
00:06:15,122 --> 00:06:17,109
So, Dad, what do you
think of my place?

137
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:19,295
Son, could you put me
in 3-D for a second?

138
00:06:19,318 --> 00:06:19,995
(click)

139
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:23,022
Why, you little...! I'll teach
you to emulate my sloppiness!

140
00:06:23,055 --> 00:06:23,715
(click)

141
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:26,002
Okay, guys. Time for you
to go to your mother's.

142
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:31,141
Here's your mom's house.

143
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:32,693
(rings doorbell)

144
00:06:32,713 --> 00:06:33,914
(sighs)
Hi, Jerry.

145
00:06:33,942 --> 00:06:36,343
Hey, Bart. Great to see you, man.
How are you?

146
00:06:36,358 --> 00:06:39,847
Great. Great. So, I guess you and Jenda
are still together? Is she there?

147
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,780
Oh, yeah. She's just
getting out of the shower.

148
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:46,073
Hey, you're looking
good, man.

149
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,793
- You been working out or what?
- No.

150
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:50,308
You're lucky, man. I have to
hit the gym like every day,

151
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,522
or I'm like...
(shrieks)

152
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,520
(kiss)
Hey, baby.

153
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,832
Hurry, boys. We're going
camping this weekend.

154
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:58,919
But <i>our</i> thing was camping.

155
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:01,631
Living out of a car
is not "camping."

156
00:07:01,648 --> 00:07:03,783
(laughing):
That's right, babe. (kiss)

157
00:07:03,785 --> 00:07:04,855
(groans)

158
00:07:04,873 --> 00:07:06,475
- Bye.
- Good-bye, Daddy!

159
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:08,714
Take care, Bart.

160
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:12,148
Hey. Check's due on the first,
whether it's a weekend or not.

161
00:07:14,262 --> 00:07:17,886
Dad, if I ever needed
fatherly wisdom, it's now.

162
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:19,986

163
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,216

164
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:28,041
Okay, everyone. Jolly did a great
job standing on her hind legs.

165
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:29,516
What does she get?

166
00:07:29,537 --> 00:07:31,437
ALL:
A goat!

(crowd cheering)

169
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,220
Cheer up, Bart. You're
working with dinosaurs.

170
00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:44,044
(sighs)
I miss my kids.

171
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,292
Come on. You're
free and sleazy.

172
00:07:46,305 --> 00:07:49,035
I know some adult dancers
that work with my mom.

173
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,763
Isn't your mom 87?

174
00:07:50,778 --> 00:07:54,536
With social security a thing of the
past, she can't afford to retire.

175
00:07:54,555 --> 00:07:57,719
I don't know how that happened
in a senate with 99 Democrats.

176
00:07:57,732 --> 00:08:00,803
That one Republican is
great at getting his way.

177
00:08:00,835 --> 00:08:02,669
(zombies moaning)

178
00:08:04,906 --> 00:08:07,133
Brains.

179
00:08:07,162 --> 00:08:09,875
Actually, Terrance, this
is a synthetic substance.

180
00:08:09,897 --> 00:08:13,057
Devised for zombie vegans.
Or "zegans."

181
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:15,308
Meh.

182
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:17,649
What are you doing here?

183
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:19,549
You weren't answering
your phone.

184
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:22,154
I was worried you might
have been bitten.

185
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:25,438
Oh. Zombies not able
to control selves.

186
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:29,386
All we do bite, bite, bite.
You, sir, am racist.

187
00:08:29,403 --> 00:08:31,383
I'm sure you're one
of the good ones.

188
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:33,981
Not to imply that there are
any bad ones, of course,

189
00:08:34,002 --> 00:08:36,301
but all stereotypes
come from a place of...

190
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:37,898
- (groans)
- Ow!

191
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,351
(moans)

192
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,445
Still meh.

193
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:42,209
(upbeat techno music blares)

194
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,810
I don't think I'm
ready for this, man.

195
00:08:45,836 --> 00:08:48,916
Dude, it's been two years
since the divorce.

196
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:52,346
Ooh. I love your perfume.
Can I smell you later?

197
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,300
Why don't you
smell me now?

198
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:56,705
Haw haw.

199
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:58,971
Well, that didn't
look so hard.

200
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,952
You know, at my job, I satisfy
ladies even bigger than you.

201
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,404
- Um, I feed dinosaurs.
- Sir, you have to leave.

202
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:08,957
You're bumming out
everybody,

203
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:11,651
and you have, like, a goat
beard stuck to your shoe.

204
00:09:11,673 --> 00:09:12,760
Huh?

205
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:14,328
(groans)

206
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,992
One, please.

207
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:30,384
Mm-hmm.

208
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:34,833
Huh? Man, that's some
targeted advertising.

209
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:42,244
After this procedure, you will have
total closure from your divorce.

210
00:09:42,275 --> 00:09:45,600
- How long does this take?
- It'll be over before I finish this...

211
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,480
(electrical buzzing)

212
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:49,239
- ...sentence.
- Wow. It works.

213
00:09:49,264 --> 00:09:51,645
I'm completely
over my ex-wife.

214
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:53,193
Do you take
wedding bands as tips?

215
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:54,614
Put it in the jar.

216
00:09:58,496 --> 00:10:01,043
One more injection in two
weeks, and you're cured.

217
00:10:01,815 --> 00:10:04,362
But until then, you may
experience some zombie-ism.

218
00:10:04,385 --> 00:10:06,386
(chuckles)

219
00:10:06,859 --> 00:10:08,759
Brains.

220
00:10:08,772 --> 00:10:10,304
No. Those are just
teaching brains.

221
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:13,211
They're like the plastic sushi in
front of a Japanese restaurant.

222
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:15,666
Window sushi fake?

223
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:17,460
Window sushi fake.

224
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:22,840
<i>Ay, caramba.</i>
I have moved on.

225
00:10:22,853 --> 00:10:25,118
Hey, passable-looking.

226
00:10:25,137 --> 00:10:28,545
Sorry. I'm just a little creeped
out by that screen saver.

227
00:10:28,558 --> 00:10:29,732
Nothing to worry about.

228
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,487
He's been frozen
like that for days.

229
00:10:31,513 --> 00:10:35,077
(moaning)

230
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,027
(whistling)

231
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:40,049
♪ Girls ♪

232
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:43,454
♪ All I really
want is girls ♪

233
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:44,947
♪ And in the morning
it's girls... ♪

234
00:10:44,968 --> 00:10:48,021
Wow. Now I see why they
call you Miss Hoover.

235
00:10:48,034 --> 00:10:49,876
You must have been
vacuuming for an hour.

236
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:52,048
Anything to please my man.

237
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:54,028
So, was it good for you?

238
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:57,037
"Good" is not a concept
in my culture!

239
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:00,756
Oh, my God. We went
home with you?

240
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:02,163
Not just me.

241
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:04,750
There's Beppo, Boppo,
Emmett Kelly the Ninth,

242
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,054
Frenchy, Insane Clown Polly
and Commodore Tee-hee.

243
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,385
(horn toots)

244
00:11:11,592 --> 00:11:13,845
Brains? Brains?

245
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,243
Garden brains.

246
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:16,584
(Milhouse grunts)

247
00:11:16,613 --> 00:11:19,048
Spicy Mexican
garden brains?

248
00:11:19,074 --> 00:11:21,332
- Too much sodium.
- (grunts)

249
00:11:22,937 --> 00:11:24,078
Give me your wallet!

250
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,171
(grunts)

251
00:11:25,197 --> 00:11:26,925
(whirring)

252
00:11:26,963 --> 00:11:28,796
(imitating siren):
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

253
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:31,094
What seems to be
the oopsie here?

254
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:32,930
(growling)

255
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:35,328
Yay! I'm fighting crime!

256
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:36,741
(grunts)

257
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:39,626
Officer needs backup.

258
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:40,759
There, back up.

259
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,131
(grunts)

260
00:11:42,156 --> 00:11:43,176
Oh?

261
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,643
The old Milhouse would have been
helpless with an asthma attack.

262
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:49,184
No breathing, no asthma.

263
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:52,218
I love how you're dropping
all your definite articles.

264
00:11:52,248 --> 00:11:54,245
Brevity soul wit.

265
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:55,230
(giggling)

266
00:11:55,445 --> 00:11:56,998
LISA:
Uh, what are you cooking?

267
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:58,616
Nothing.

268
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:02,176
You know, Dad
really misses you.

269
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:04,238
Well, I don't miss
his nonsense.

270
00:12:04,244 --> 00:12:06,278
There's a lot of stuff
he blamed on raccoons

271
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,887
that I'm starting
to suspect was him.

272
00:12:08,913 --> 00:12:13,188
Look, maybe I shouldn't have done
this, but I've got him right here.

273
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,446
Oh.

274
00:12:17,193 --> 00:12:19,433
Sorry, I must have
recorded over Dad.

275
00:12:19,456 --> 00:12:22,284
But admit it. When you thought
it was Dad, you were excited.

276
00:12:22,304 --> 00:12:26,182
It's only natural to miss a
man you buried 127 times.

277
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:30,347
(classical music playing)

278
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:36,731
(whooshing)

279
00:12:39,229 --> 00:12:41,673
Hey, Homer, your robot
body finally came.

280
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:42,813
About time!

281
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:45,241
(whooshing)

282
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:47,035
Huh. Huh.

283
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:49,999
Hmm? Hey, where's my junk?

284
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:52,148
Oh.

285
00:12:52,568 --> 00:12:54,278
Whew!
(doorbell rings)

286
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:56,340
Hello?

287
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,343
(laughter, whirring)

288
00:12:58,368 --> 00:13:02,135
- Oh, you boys look happy.
- Yeah, but Mom's sad.

289
00:13:02,151 --> 00:13:03,484
Jerry moved out.

290
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,553
(Jenda cries)

291
00:13:04,581 --> 00:13:06,194
I thought he was
the one, Bart.

292
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,755
I just put in a saltwater tank where
he could shed his exoskeleton.

293
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,713
And now when I walk by
it, I feel like a fool.

294
00:13:12,732 --> 00:13:14,359
He's the fool.
You're great.

295
00:13:14,384 --> 00:13:16,797
You're just saying that
because you have to.

296
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,244
I don't have to
say anything.

297
00:13:18,271 --> 00:13:21,671
Believe me, no guy wants to see his
ex looking hot or being sweet.

298
00:13:21,705 --> 00:13:23,765
Makes him realize
everything he's lost.

299
00:13:23,793 --> 00:13:26,366
Wow. Wow. You've
really grown.

300
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,879
We should have
dinner sometime.

301
00:13:27,904 --> 00:13:29,474
Hey, Dad, can you
watch the boys?

302
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:31,033
Sure.

303
00:13:33,337 --> 00:13:34,650
(high-pitched whistling)

304
00:13:34,984 --> 00:13:36,961
Body, to Moe's.

305
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:42,804
Hey, you're kind of
quiet tonight, Homer.

306
00:13:42,832 --> 00:13:43,959
(belches loudly)

307
00:13:48,651 --> 00:13:50,173
(whirring)

308
00:13:50,214 --> 00:13:52,215
(crowd chatter, gentle
instrumental music plays)

309
00:13:59,395 --> 00:14:01,528
You know, this was
a great evening.

310
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:03,538
(in squeaky voice):
Please enjoy your desserts.

311
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:05,768
Man, when is that
voice gonna change?

312
00:14:05,802 --> 00:14:07,142
(whimpering)

313
00:14:11,313 --> 00:14:14,173
Suddenly, I want a
different dessert.

314
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:15,940
But they brought us
little cakes and...

315
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,389
Oh.

316
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:19,013
<i>Ay, caramba.</i>

317
00:14:21,993 --> 00:14:24,086
(metallic thudding)

318
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:27,124
Oop, oop, uh, yeah, open
your stance a little there.

319
00:14:27,144 --> 00:14:28,784
Oh! Yeah, that's it.

320
00:14:28,806 --> 00:14:30,635
Do your worst, kids!

321
00:14:32,723 --> 00:14:33,710
(both gasp)

322
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:36,658
Come on! Hug your
grandpa, boys!

323
00:14:36,694 --> 00:14:38,134
(whimpering)

324
00:14:38,154 --> 00:14:41,232
Threat perceived.
Terminate! Terminate!

325
00:14:41,252 --> 00:14:42,525
(yelling)

326
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:44,058
(laughing)

327
00:14:44,071 --> 00:14:46,768
Kids are so afraid
of being terminated.

328
00:14:46,777 --> 00:14:49,077
Looking good, Santa's
Little Hybrid.

329
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,266
Father, what am I?

330
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,668
JENDA: Guys, sit down.

331
00:14:53,674 --> 00:14:55,624
Our lives are gonna
change a little.

332
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:57,671
- Uh-oh.
- This is never good.

333
00:14:57,691 --> 00:15:01,155
This <i>is</i> good. Your father and I are
gonna try to make it work again.

334
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:04,853
Like a classic rock band whose
hold-out member finally needs money.

335
00:15:04,873 --> 00:15:08,613
Wow. Everyone's back together
except Gramma and Grampa.

336
00:15:08,632 --> 00:15:11,357
Oh, I think that's
about to change.

337
00:15:11,381 --> 00:15:13,829
(high-pitched mechanical
whirring and hissing)

338
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,291
Aren't you going
to work, Dad?

339
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:19,144
One of us has to stay
home with you guys.

340
00:15:19,171 --> 00:15:21,073
And your mom can't quit
her job at Google.

341
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,421
They need my help hunting down those
self-driving cars that turned evil.

342
00:15:24,576 --> 00:15:27,212
Oh, you passed
another rest stop!

343
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:29,397
<i>I am not stopping again.</i>

344
00:15:29,423 --> 00:15:32,050
But I had a large soda!

345
00:15:32,075 --> 00:15:33,843
<i>I said get the small!</i>

346
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:35,805
It was only 50 cents more!

347
00:15:35,825 --> 00:15:37,905
<i>Let's play The Quiet Game!</i>

348
00:15:37,948 --> 00:15:38,748
(groans)

349
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:39,498
(groans)

350
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:41,949
Now, will somebody hold
up a one dollar bill?

351
00:15:41,965 --> 00:15:43,109
(bellowing screech)

352
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:44,642
(screaming)

353
00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:46,089
(laughter)

354
00:15:46,102 --> 00:15:47,310
(thunderous footsteps,
audience gasping)

355
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:50,912
Uh-oh. It looks like we woke
someone up from her nap.

356
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:53,126
(laughter)

357
00:15:53,146 --> 00:15:56,402
Well, now that you're up,
you can do your juggling act.

358
00:15:56,421 --> 00:15:59,044
(low growl)

359
00:15:59,303 --> 00:16:01,650
(laughter)

360
00:16:01,665 --> 00:16:03,566
(sad growl)

361
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:06,067
Milhouse, you were supposed
to come see me today

362
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,515
for your final
anti-zombie injection.

363
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:10,991
- (groans)
- Yes, well, uh...

364
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,780
But I'm supposed to
be in surgery now,

365
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,844
so I guess we're both
playing hooky. (laughs)

366
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,583
But, Lisa, if you want Milhouse
to return to his old self,

367
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,950
then you'd better bring him in
for that shot tomorrow.

368
00:16:20,971 --> 00:16:21,964
But, Doctor...

369
00:16:21,984 --> 00:16:24,498
(whispering): He's so much more
interesting this way.

370
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:26,088
(growling)

371
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:28,841
- Ooh.
- I see.

372
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:32,686
Now enjoy the majesty of
our prehistoric past.

373
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:34,201
(horn toots)

374
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:41,990
So, that earring I lost in the
teleport, turns out it's in Florida.

375
00:16:42,012 --> 00:16:42,856
Yes!

376
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,834
That's not a
listening-to-me "yes."

377
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,657
- You're watching something.
- What? Me? Oh, that's crazy.

378
00:16:48,892 --> 00:16:52,713
You know, I knew it. This is supposed to
be us time, and you're lensing a game.

379
00:16:52,736 --> 00:16:56,221
Well, you're not paying attention
to me. You're texting.

380
00:16:57,154 --> 00:17:01,160
Yeah, only to complain about you
not paying any attention to me.

381
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:02,800
If I wasn't
paying attention,

382
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:05,274
then how did I notice
you not paying attention

383
00:17:05,288 --> 00:17:07,744
to my not paying
attention? Ha!

384
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,704
Oh, I thought this time things
were gonna be different.

385
00:17:10,727 --> 00:17:12,782
They are. You're
four years older.

386
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:15,429
Wow. What does <i>that</i> mean?

387
00:17:15,446 --> 00:17:18,081
Uh...

388
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:22,357
Hey, Bart, what'll it be?

389
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,777
A tall beer and no
judgmental women.

390
00:17:24,804 --> 00:17:27,371
That is so typical of you.

391
00:17:27,384 --> 00:17:28,592
What are you doing here?

392
00:17:28,605 --> 00:17:30,979
I have to decide whether
to make Milhouse...

393
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:31,759
(sighs)

394
00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:33,066
...human again.

395
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,348
I even prefer the
way he smells now.

396
00:17:35,374 --> 00:17:40,850
Some meat went bad in our freezer,
and my heart skipped a beat.

397
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:44,584
Phoo! You two don't know
what a rough marriage is.

398
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:49,005
Mom, I got to know. Once and
for all, what is the secret?

399
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:51,586
Why did you stay
with Dad so long?

400
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,858
Until I was eight, I thought
he was a magical gorilla.

401
00:17:54,878 --> 00:17:56,746
Look, life's tough.

402
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:58,753
It's hard to
make it through.

403
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:01,625
The only way I know is
when you make a decision

404
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,845
that comes from your
heart, you stick with it.

405
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:05,565
(sighs)

406
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:08,256
- Like my marriage.
- Or my divorce.

407
00:18:08,275 --> 00:18:11,311
Or my decision to support
Duffman in his old age.

408
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:13,867
Duffman can still
swing and party.

409
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:15,925
(wheezy):
Oh, yeah.

410
00:18:18,482 --> 00:18:22,206
Wait, Mom. Does that mean
you're going to take Dad back?

411
00:18:22,232 --> 00:18:25,530
No, I'm going to
join him forever.

412
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,533
(electrical buzzing)

413
00:18:30,112 --> 00:18:31,212
(moaning)

414
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,853
- (gasps)
- (laughs)

415
00:18:34,508 --> 00:18:36,021
Oh.

416
00:18:36,486 --> 00:18:39,039
(electronic beeps,
tune plays)

417
00:18:39,594 --> 00:18:44,211
I can't tell if that was love, suicide
or a... a really boring video game.

418
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:47,162
Lisa, your husband
is... fine.

419
00:18:47,184 --> 00:18:48,317
(chuckles)

420
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,582
No residual zombie-ism
whatsoever.

421
00:18:50,614 --> 00:18:51,789
Are you sure?

422
00:18:51,816 --> 00:18:54,718
Watch. I'll just wave this
juicy brain in front of him.

423
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:57,005
I'm gonna faint!

424
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,427
Hooray.

425
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,637
So, Jenda, I don't
know what love is,

426
00:19:00,658 --> 00:19:03,746
but I know what it
isn't, and we're <i>isn't.</i>

427
00:19:03,766 --> 00:19:05,093
Yeah. You're right.

428
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,735
That's why I started seeing Jerry
again without telling you.

429
00:19:07,762 --> 00:19:09,323
Hey, buddy, how,
uh, how you doing?

430
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,960
What?! Oh!

431
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,054
You know what, Jenda?
I'm not even mad,

432
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:15,648
because I'm finally,
completely over you.

433
00:19:15,673 --> 00:19:17,137
(whooshing)

434
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,089
WOMAN:
...sentence.

435
00:19:20,271 --> 00:19:22,331
Wait. What am I
doing back here?

436
00:19:22,357 --> 00:19:24,660
You never left. Everything
that you experienced

437
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:26,367
between when I flipped
the switch and now

438
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,601
was just a neural implant
in your temporal lobe.

439
00:19:28,632 --> 00:19:31,399
Uh, you should look
at my profile.

440
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:33,956
Oh. Uh-huh.

441
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:37,442
It was all a dream, and
now you can go home.

442
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,668
So, you're sure I'm cured?

443
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:40,508
No more feelings
for my ex-wife?

444
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:43,467
I'm positive. We treat a lot
of people for obsessions.

445
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:44,577
(electrical buzzing,
whooshing)

446
00:19:44,603 --> 00:19:47,864
It's a whole new day
for Nothing Stu!

447
00:19:49,285 --> 00:19:51,898
Wow. I'm free.
Get ready, world.

448
00:19:51,911 --> 00:19:54,276
I've got a whole new set
of mistakes to make.

449
00:19:54,285 --> 00:19:55,689
(whistling)

450
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,662
Uh, ol' Gil could
use a fresh start.

451
00:19:58,688 --> 00:20:00,315
Weren't you just in
here this morning?

452
00:20:00,337 --> 00:20:02,217
I've had a bad day.

453
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:12,142
After 35 years of marriage,
we've finally gotten it right.

454
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:15,339
Yes, even my personality
has gotten,

455
00:20:15,358 --> 00:20:18,312
shall we say, an upgrade.

456
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:21,307
Oh! That's a bit
of a whoo-hoo.

457
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:22,816
Indeed.

458
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:25,134
Lis, I hope things work out
with you and Milhouse,

459
00:20:25,153 --> 00:20:27,742
but if they don't, I know
just where you should go.

460
00:20:27,762 --> 00:20:30,982
Thanks, but Milhouse and I
are in a pretty good place.

461
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:32,909
Even though he's not
a zombie anymore?

462
00:20:32,935 --> 00:20:36,099
No, that's what happened
in your false memories.

463
00:20:36,123 --> 00:20:38,676
- There is no cure for zombie-ism.
- (groaning)

464
00:20:38,698 --> 00:20:42,489
Dead flower from
dead husband.

465
00:20:42,523 --> 00:20:44,257
(sighs dreamily)

466
00:20:45,591 --> 00:20:47,892
And I was a false
memory, too.

467
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:50,810
- No, you were real.
- Aw, shucks.

468
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:02,991
ANNOUNCER: <i>Next week on Fox
Television's</i> The Simpsons:

469
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:04,304
Sit down.

470
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:05,562
You're not going anywhere.

471
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,316
(gasps)

472
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:07,488
Release the...

473
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,579
It ain't what you think!

474
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,046
I said no mayo!

475
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:12,586
<i>Ay, caramba.</i>

476
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:14,565
(laughs)

477
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:18,180
