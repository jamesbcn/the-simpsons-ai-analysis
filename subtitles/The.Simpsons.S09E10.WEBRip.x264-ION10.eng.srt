{\an8}Ah! I love these lazy Saturdays.

00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,540
{\an8}It's Wednesday, Homer.

10
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:42,964
{\an8}(shrieks) Work!

13
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,924
{\an8}I love these real Saturdays.

14
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,797
{\an8}They're so relaxing.

15
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,014
{\an8}Not like that fake Saturday
that almost got me fired.

{\an8}Is this all we're going to do today?

19
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,728
{\an8}Absolutely.

20
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,194

00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,935

24
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:13,989
{\an8}You know, Homer,

25
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,294
{\an8}I'm starting to realize life is short.

26
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,288
{\an8}It is?

27
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,829
{\an8}We have to make the most
of the time we have.

28
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,794
{\an8}We do?!

29
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,833
{\an8}Otherwise, we could wake up one day

30
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,047
{\an8}and realize we've wasted our whole lives.

31
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,838
{\an8}Oh, that.

32
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,472
{\an8}(chuckles)

00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,887

00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,848
{\an8}Hmm, "Friends of the library"

35
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,520
{\an8}is holding an historic manuscript viewing.

36
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,349
{\an8}(blowing raspberry)
Friends of the library?

37
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,477
{\an8}Ooh... Ooh!

38
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,072
{\an8}There's an Azalea festival
at the public garden.

39
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,688
{\an8}I went yesterday.

40
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:49,935
{\an8}(groans)

41
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,946
{\an8}Lenny really wanted to go!

42
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:55,068
{\an8}I'm tired of being cooped up
in this house all the time.

43
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,196
Open a window.

44
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,492
{\an8}Oh...

45
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,035
All right, I hear you, honey.

46
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,000
Change into something nice.

47
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,250
We're stepping out.

48
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,380
The police auction?

49
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,842
Can you believe it?

50
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,342
It's already been a year.

51
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,304
Wow, sweetheart, look
at all this seized booty.

52
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,307
We could find the drug boat of our dreams.

53
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,350
I don't want a drug boat.

54
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,893
Well, I bet there's drug dresses

55
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,058
and drug vacuum cleaners, too.

56
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,307
WIGGUM: All right, listen up.

57
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,728
Listen up!

58
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,236
These prestigious, wrought iron

59
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,108
security gates are bulletproof, bombproof,

60
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,526
and battering-ram resistant.

61
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,574
Now...

62
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,197
Then what happened to Johnny D.?

63
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,414
He forgot to lock them.

64
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,083
Now, what am I bid?

65
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,002
-One kilo.
-Sold.

66
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,577
Ay-yi-yi, my gates.

67
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,246
Ay, Johnny C. Gave me those.

68
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,205
Tough break, <i>Amigo.</i>

69
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,876
(laughs)

70
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,884
Next item up for bids.

71
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,926
(crowd murmuring)

72
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,100
{\an8}Oh, no!

73
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,429
Oh, hey, look,
they're selling your car, man.

74
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,675
Boy, it's nice.

75
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:08,557
Oh, I will totally kill
whoever buys li'l bandit.

76
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,646
Sold.

77
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,981
Woo-hoo!

78
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,106
(imitating car revving)

79
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,823
You bought a car

80
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,613
without consulting me?

81
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,236
I don't recall being consulted

82
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,663
when you bought that hat.

83
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,531
I found this hat.

84
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,948
Then what are you complaining about?

85
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,036
You got yours.

86
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,040
Mm-hmm-mm.

87
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,371
(tires screeching)

88
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,053
(tires screeching)

89
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,758
Homer, be careful.

90
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,419
Oh, yeah, you got to be careful

91
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,467
when you do a trick like this.

92
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,390
(screaming)

93
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,469
Stop, Homer!

94
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,103
Stop it. Let me out!

95
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,180
You're the boss.

96
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,975
I'm not getting back in this car

97
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,901
until you drive like a sane person.

98
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,149
OK, bye, love you.

99
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,872
You know, if you lived here
you'd be home by now.

100
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,290
{\an8}Mr. Hutz, I didn't know
you sold real estate.

101
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,500
{\an8}You didn't?

102
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,459
{\an8}We should talk more often, Marge.

103
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,377
You see, the law business is a little slow

104
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,959
and since most of my clients

105
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,504
wind up losing their houses,

106
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,257
this was a natural move for me.

107
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,219
Helping people find homes...

108
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,760
That must be really rewarding.

109
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,933
Yes, the money is good.

110
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,012
But the beauty is

111
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,847
you get to stay in the house
until it's sold.

112
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,643
Come on, guys, let's go for a swim.

113
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,766
(dogs barking)

114
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,225
Gee, this hot rod is souped-up

115
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,725
six ways from Sunday.

116
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,937
Never had you figured
for a gear-head, Homer.

117
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,357
Oh, yeah, I'm a real expert.

118
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,116
Is that a six-barrel holley carb?

119
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,368
{\an8}-You betcha.
-Edelbrock intakes?

120
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,700
{\an8}-Nothing but.
-Meyerhof lifters?

121
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,696
{\an8}Oh, yeah.

122
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,957
I made that last one up.

123
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,458
I see.

124
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,543
MARGE: Selling real estate could be

125
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,626
just what I'm looking for.

126
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,091
I'd really like to give it a try.

127
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,381
I don't know, Marge.

128
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,514
Trying is the first step
toward failure. (grunts)

129
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:06,218
Oh, boy, I've got a lot to
learn before that license test.

130
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,556
Don't worry, Mom, we'll help you study.

131
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,891
'Course, we'll have to cut back

132
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,936
on our own homework.

133
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,599
What in the heck is a "dwelling"?

134
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,146
So, you're married

135
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,732
and looking for your first house

136
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,397
Mr. and Mrs...?

137
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,855
-Superman.
-Oh, don't listen to my husband.

138
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:23,867
He's just an idiot.

139
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,488
Now, I'm a veterinarian

140
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,155
and I need to keep lots of
sick animals in my house.

141
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,544
Is that permitted?

142
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,620
Not in my damn house!

143
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,575
Well, this neighborhood is zoned R-3,

144
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,416
{\an8}which allows dogs, cats,
phone-answering monkeys,

145
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,673
and... Oh...

146
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,092
I'll never memorize all this.

147
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,297
When I had to learn about the <i>Magna Carta,</i>

148
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,557
I made up a song.

149
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:48,808
(to the tune of "Camptown Races")

150
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,810
<i>♪ In 1215 at runnymede, doo-dah, doo-dah ♪</i>

151
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:55,153
<i>♪ The nobles and the king</i>
<i>agreed, oh, de doo-dah day ♪</i>

152
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,109
We should have lived together first.

153
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,900
ALL: <i>♪ On the closing day,</i>

157
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,240
You're all nuts.

158
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,747
(humming "Swanee River")

159
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,257
-Easement!
-(bell rings)

160
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,419
Time's up.

161
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,007
You may now undermine
each other's confidence.

162
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:29,513
Arr, I nailed that one
about houseboats. Did you?

163
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,306
I passed!

164
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,811
(both): Yay! Way to go!

165
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,063
Uh-Oh!

166
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,437
Oh, thank you, Bart.

167
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,323
Thank you, Lisa, for all your help.

168
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
What about me? You didn't thank me.

169
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,735
{\an8}You didn't do anything.

170
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,780
I like being thanked.

171
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,945
Welcome to the big leagues, Marge.

172
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,417
There's over 50 years
of real-estate experience

173
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,708
right in this room.

174
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,211
And 42 of those years are Gil's.

175
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,303
Marge, it's a real pleasure.

176
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,549
You got any leads?

177
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,050
I need some leads. Please, help me.

178
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,053
That's enough, Gil.

179
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,844
Don't drag her down with you.

180
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,512
That's Cookie Kwan.

181
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,717
She's number one on the west side.

182
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,888
Hi, Marge.

183
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,647
Stay off the west side.

184
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,608
And there's Nick Callahan.

185
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,149
MARGE: A headset telephone?!

186
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,993
I thought those
only existed in the movies.

187
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,908
Boo-ya! Guess who sold the Whitman place.

188
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,831
-Way to go, Nick.
-(indistinct chatter)

189
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,829
I've been working on
the Whitman place for 21 years.

190
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,872
And now, Marge, I'd like
to welcome you to the family

191
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,707
with your very own red blazer.

192
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,303
(gasps) For me?

193
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,513
(all cheering)

194
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,675
Thank you.

195
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,104
Thank you, everybody.

196
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:59,063
I'm going to do my darndest
to uphold the principles

197
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,185
and ideals this jacket represents.

198
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,315
I give her a week.

199
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,702
Are you guys talking about the west side?

200
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,908
No, Cookie. I swear it.

201
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,988
I'm scared of you.

202
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,660
Whoa, Dad!

203
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,658
Doesn't this car have seat belts?

204
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,167
Seat belts? Pfft!

205
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,288
They kill more people than they save.

206
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,125
That's not true.
You're thinking of airbags.

207
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,798
There it is!

208
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,091
(brakes screeching)

209
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,514
BART AND LISA: Wow!

210
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,262
LISA: Your own billboard!

211
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,554
BART: Check it out.

212
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,347
HOMER: Gee, that picture
makes your butt look big.

213
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,811
I thought so, too, but they said it sells.

214
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,313
{\an8}Works for the lumber king.

215
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,983
{\an8}Lumber. We need lumber.

216
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,317
Excuse me, Mr. Szyslak.

217
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,322
Have you ever considered
selling your home?

218
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:53,164
What? No. Why? What?
Why? What've you heard?

219
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,791
Are you implying I'm in
some sort of financial trouble?

220
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:56,828
No.

221
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,251
Well, I am. Let me have that card.

222
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,959
(slamming)

223
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,627
And here we have a lovely gourmet kitchen

224
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,921
with gas range,

225
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,134
central can-opener,

226
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,184
and foam under-flooring
for enhanced standability.

227
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,549
Why, isn't this kitchen horribly cramped?

228
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,216
(chuckling)

229
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,887
Why, yes, it is.

230
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,234
Well, I suppose we could get used to it.

231
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,769
Yeah, but you shouldn't have to settle.

232
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,439
You know, I've always loved
the house you're in now.

233
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,149
Really?

234
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,114
Well, maybe we should stay put.

235
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,658
Thanks for your honesty, Marge.

236
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,948
My pleasure.

237
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,741
If you ever need a prescription,

238
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,155
no questions asked...

239
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,243
(clicking tongue)

240
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,657
(hearty chuckle)

241
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,627
Good shot, Barbara!

242
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,961
I can't believe it--

243
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,955
A house with a bowling alley!

244
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,167
Do you bowl often?

245
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,797
Actually, this is our first time

246
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,514
and I didn't really care for it.

247
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,715
Oh. Well, then you have to ask yourself,

248
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,726
is this the right house for you?

249
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,558
I suppose not.

250
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:06,113
I guess we were just captivated
by this delightful plaque.

251
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,937
(hearty laughter)

252
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,480
(tires screeching)

253
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,988
(engine revving)

254
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,609
Hey, skinner, want to drag-race?

255
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,027
My high school sweetheart

256
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,325
was killed in a drag-racing accident.

257
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,409
Come on.

258
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,913
It'll be fun.

259
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,455
{\an8}That's what Debbie Sue said.

260
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,329
(gears grinding)

261
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,876
Come on, you... Stupid... Car.

262
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,250
You... Get... Going!

263
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,208
(gears still grinding)

264
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,468
That's li'l bandit

265
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,180
and she's in pain!

266
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,221
Screw the honor system.

267
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,346
My car needs me.

268
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,813
Hey, you're ruining it for the rest of us!

269
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,112
Stop! That's my car!

270
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,439
(tires squealing)

271
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,693
(coughing)

272
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,935
(sniffing)

273
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,936
Hey, that smells like regular.

274
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,908
{\an8}She needs premium, dude!

275
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,488
(screaming) Premium!

276
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,994
Dude!

277
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,198
Marge, I had a lot of calls about you.

278
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,077
Customers love your no-pressure approach.

279
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,245
Well, like we say,

280
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,844
"The right house for the right person."

281
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,340
Listen, it's time I let you in
on a little secret, Marge.

282
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,303
The right house is the house
that's for sale.

283
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,795
The right person is anyone.

284
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,387
But... All I did was tell the truth.

285
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,853
Of course you did.

286
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,023
But there's... The truth...

287
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,306
And the truth.

288
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,481
Let me show you.

289
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,904
MARGE: It's awfully small.

290
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,704
I'd say it's awfully... Cozy.

291
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,664
{\an8}MARGE: That's dilapidated.

292
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,030
Rustic.

293
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,657
That house is on fire.

294
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,293
Motivated seller.

295
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,618
That's a beauty.

296
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,877
Forget about that house.
That's the murder house.

297
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,286
Ooh, I remember.

298
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,918
Mrs. Astor was very lucky.

299
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,875
Well, no one expects you
to sell that house

300
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,177
But you'd better sell something.

301
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,305
Because cubicles are for closers, Marge.

302
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,719
Anybody who doesn't sell a house

303
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,347
their first week gets fired.

304
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,524
I probably should have
mentioned that earlier.

305
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,192
I thought I'd do anything
to succeed in business,

306
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,645
but bending the truth, I don't know.

307
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,106
Ah, so you don't have
that killer instinct. Big deal.

308
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,157
Yeah, honey. Even if you don't
succeed in the business world,

309
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,202
you're still the world's
greatest wife and mother.

310
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,172
(groans) So that's how you see me?

311
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,538
As a spineless potato-cooking housewife

312
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,285
who can't compete in the real world?

313
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,957
ALL: Mm-hmm.

314
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,545
Well, I can, too, compete

315
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,470
and I'm going to sell a house.

316
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,759
End of story.

317
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,346
Kids, your mother's
under a lot of pressure.

318
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,139
Why don't we let her
clear the table in peace?

319
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,767
(groans)

320
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,936
The first house I have
to show you is, um...

321
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,651
A handyman's dream.

322
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,487
Because it's so dilapidated.

323
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,492
(murmurs)

324
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,163
Well, nothing's perfect.

325
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,491
I sure hate to make you come out here

326
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,786
and not buy a house. (chuckles)

327
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,369
No, slow down, Neddy.

328
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,794
The home-buyers course said

329
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,922
always look inside
the house before buying.

330
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,420
Well, there it is.

331
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,418
Please don't tell anyone how I live.

332
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,297
Hmm... It's awfully small.

333
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,055
Some people would call it cozy.

334
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,518
I guess it is sort of cute.

335
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:28,852
But small.

336
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,353
Really, really small.

337
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,848
Hmm. Wh-when you put it that way

338
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,897
it does seem a bit small.

339
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,482
(disappointed murmur)

340
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,031
Well, that about does it
for houses in this area...

341
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,400
Oh, wait. What about that house?

342
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,818
That has a "for sale" sign.

343
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,696
(suspenseful music plays)

344
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,794
Ooh, that's a dilly.

345
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:49,999
How about it, Marge?

346
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,789
(uncomfortable murmur)

347
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,916
NEDDY: Oh, my-diddly-i!

348
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,546
Will you look at this place!

349
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,013
(gasps)

350
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,263
And the price has been slashed repeatedly.

351
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,635
It's sure built solid.

352
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,431
The kids could scream bloody murder

353
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,675
and no one would hear.

354
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,516
Well, I'm just going to spill my guts.

355
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,731
I love it to death.

356
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,521
I'm going to give you
a deposit this minute.

357
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,613
Unless you can give me a reason not to.

358
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,533
Is there anything else
we should know, Marge?

359
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,912
(echoey voice) There's the truth...

360
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,199
And the truth.

361
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,782
(lady screaming) <i>No... No!</i>

362
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,237
If you don't sell a house,

363
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,496
you're fired, fired, fired...

364
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,329
(lady screaming)

365
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,455
Well, Marge?

366
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,724
No. There is absolutely nothing else

367
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,430
to tell you about this house.

368
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,890
That's good enough for me.

369
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,847
(screaming)

370
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,390
Purple drapes!

371
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,563
All my life I've wanted purple drapes.

372
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,392
(screaming)

373
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,034
Attention.

374
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,071
Ding-ding, ding-ding ding-ding.

375
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,453
Listen up, everybody.

376
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,659
Marge Simpson sold her first house.

377
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,450
-How about that?
-How nice.

378
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,333
The murder house.

379
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,750
-Wow! Now, that's something.
-Hoo-yay.

380
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,830
Wow, you must have told a whopper

381
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,536
to unload that deathtrap.

382
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,916
And what'd you use, Marge? Huh?

383
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,672
The old <i>Buff 'n' Bluff?</i>

384
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,134
The <i>Hail Murray?</i>

385
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,213
The <i>Susquehanna Shuffle?</i>

386
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,008
Huh? (clicks) Huh? (clicks) Huh?

387
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,012
No. No, no tricks.

388
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,144
It was salesmanship, that's all.

389
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,261
Sure, Marge.

390
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,768
"Salesmanship."

391
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,269
But it was.

392
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,601
Sure, Marge. "Was."

393
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,856
Look, just because everyone
who lived in that house

394
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,979
was hacked to bits, doesn't mean
the Flanders will be.

395
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,817
{\an8}Guess you're right. Who cares?

396
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,072
Well, whatever happens

397
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,493
as our newest closer,

398
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:51,241
you're entitled to wear
the coveted closing blazer.

399
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,655
(scattered applause)

400
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,663
And you get a third wall for your cubical.

401
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,121
But I earned that wall.

402
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,498
Don't push your luck, Pal.

403
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,504
You're hanging on by a thread.

404
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,506
Well, I brought this wall from home.

405
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,218
(tires screeching)

406
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,219
(laughs)

407
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,512
OK.

408
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,635
Baldy boy hits wire, head comes off,

409
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,563
l'il bandit rolls to a gentle stop.

410
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,563
Everybody wins.

411
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,646
Man, the air feels good on my neck.

412
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,661
Whoo! Gum ball!

413
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,825
Oh, why do I even bother?

414
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,964
(car approaching)

415
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,461
I told that idiot to slice my sandwich.

416
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,299
Oh!

417
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,720
Wow, honey, you sold a house

418
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,379
and got rid of the Flanders.

419
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,677
What's for dinner?

420
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,554
Well, neighborinos,

421
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,177
I guess this is goodbye.

422
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,215
I'd better make this quick

423
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,137
or I'm going to start
blubbering like a baby.

424
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,306
Yeah, me, too.

425
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,654
Let me know if you need any help.

426
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,809
Now that you mention it, we could use...

427
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,357
It was just an expression.

428
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,651
Mm... Good-bye, Ned.

429
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,316
If the slightest thing
goes wrong with that house,

430
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,905
I want you to call me right away

431
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,030
or you can beep me.

432
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,196
In fact, why don't you
just stay here tonight?

433
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,285
We'll go to a hotel.

434
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,369
Oh, you're sweet to offer,

435
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,205
but we're all just so tired.

436
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,580
We just want to get to our new house

437
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,876
and rest in peace.

438
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,589
So long, Simpsons.

439
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:26,669
-Bye!
-Bye.

440
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,133
(shuddering)

441
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,256
That old Flanders' place
gives me the creeps.

442
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,511
<i>♪ My name is Luka ♪</i>

443
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,518
<i>♪ I live ♪</i>

444
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,019
<i>♪ On the second floor... ♪</i>

445
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,140
(Homer screams)

446
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,186
Give me my car, fatty.

447
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,270
(grunting)

448
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,614
This is my car!

449
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,649
And I'm not fat, it's glandular.

450
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,653
Right.

451
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,534
(grunting)

452
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,411
MARGE: Ooh...

453
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:05,081
You've got to tell them
the truth, Marge, the truth.

454
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,626
Hello?

455
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,297
Anyone home?

456
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,728
(screaming)

457
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,598
Oh, hi, Marge.

458
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,817
(chuckles) Guess we gave you
quite a start.

459
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,228
We were painting Todd's room red--

460
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,487
Pretty messy work--

461
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,608
And then we came out here to take a break.

462
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:34,605
Must have dozed off.

463
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,736
Red room. Red room.

464
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,985
Over there.

465
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,246
Well, I'm just glad you're OK.

466
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,539
(sighs)

467
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,504
And I have something to tell you.

468
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,383
(both grunting and groaning)

469
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,799
(tires screeching)

470
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:53,881
My head!

471
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,126
(grunting)

472
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,217
Come on, let's hear that snap.

473
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,183
(grunting)

474
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,265
You...

475
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,612
(grunting)

476
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,397
Ow.

477
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,693
-You're...
-Ow.

478
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,736
-Going...
-Ow.

479
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,739
-Down...
-Ow.

480
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,820
Punk!

481
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,702
Whoa, this is so dangerous.

482
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:22,865
Yeah, you're right.

483
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,503
{\an8}Wha... What the...

484
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:33,546
{\an8}This is Wiggum reporting a 318-- waking a
police officer.

485
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,670
(siren wailing)

486
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,006
(gasping)

487
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,931
This is the murder house?

488
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,470
Mm-hmm.

489
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:43,523
Oh, you mean the infamous
"jealous jockey murders"?

490
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,309
Mm-hmm.

491
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,812
(gasping) Of course.

492
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,145
This must be where he dropped the dagger.

493
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,610
And this is the butler's pantry

494
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,280
where Mrs. Astor concealed herself

495
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,864
And right here's where
they found the torso heap

496
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,364
in front of our very own fireplace.

497
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,737
{\an8}Oh, just think, Neddy.

498
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,993
We're part of Springfield history.

499
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:05,245
Look, Daddy, I'm the jealous jockey.

500
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,709
I'm a torso.

501
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,828
I'm glad you're not mad,

502
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,786
but I lied to you

503
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,836
and I won't feel right

504
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,919
until I return your deposit.

505
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,634
We appreciate the offer, Marge,

506
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,344
but... I think we're going
to be very happy here.

507
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,184
{\an8}(all screaming)

508
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,768
(siren wailing)

509
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,570
Oh... Marge... (giggling)

510
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,941
Still got that deposit check?

511
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,202
(groaning)

512
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,912
Oh, wow.

513
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:47,002
Lucky thing we landed on this bubble wrap.

514
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,409
Hey, quit hogging.

515
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,037
Oh... I'm badly hurt.

516
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,830
{\an8}A smashed hot rod?

517
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,208
{\an8}A wrecked police cruiser?

518
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,594
{\an8}A destroyed house?

519
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,921
{\an8}I've had it with
your renegade ways, Simpson.

520
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,006
-You're a loose cannon.
-But I...

521
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,432
And what really fries me

522
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,180
is you returned his check!

523
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,182
I'm sorry, Mr. Hutz,
but I just can't lie to people.

524
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,226
(laughing)

525
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,349
You're one of a kind, Marge.

526
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,686
And nobody deserves this more than you.

527
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,526
Mm...

528
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,992
Well, I'm proud of you, Mom.

529
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,450
You refused to compromise your integrity.

530
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,281
Yeah. You did the right thing...
Eventually.

531
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,787
Still, it would've been nice

532
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,158
to bring home at least one paycheck.

533
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,916
Oh, you will, honey.

534
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,754
You will.

535
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,222
$300 for doing nothing?

536
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,470
I feel like such a crook.

537
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,512
Don't worry.

538
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,434
Gets easier every week.

539
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,404
(theme music playing)

540
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,323
-(murmuring)
-Shh!
