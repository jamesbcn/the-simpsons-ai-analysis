you hear on the playground,

As usual, the playground
has the facts right,

41
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,376

42
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,973
Sushi is considered
quite a delicacy.

-No!

00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,595
what makes you think I'm gonna
say yes the second time?

47
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,733
Nothing, but you may say yes
the 99th time.

00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,640
Oh? Try me.

-Please, Dad.
-No.

-No. No.

one of those.

-Akira, my good man.

two sharks, an octopus

70
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,190
-and an eel.
-Very good.

71
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,773
Do you have any giant squid?
The kind that drags men

72
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,738
-to their deaths?
-Not today. Sir?

73
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,239
It's so hard to choose.

74
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,702
It all looks
so terrible.

75
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,491
Just bring me one of these,
and one of these,

76
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,536

No, no, no. Toshiro,
that squid looks like

81
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,344
it's been hacked
by a blind woodsman.

Yes, yes, it is poisonous,
potentially fatal,

127
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,340

it can be quite tasty.

Beautiful language,
isn't it, Marge?

145
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,822
For God's sake,
don't eat another bite.

146
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,241
Oh, I couldn't possibly.

147
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,779
Mr. Simpsonsan,
I shall be blunt.

148
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,203
We have reason to believe
you have eaten...

149
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,452
-poison.
-Poison! Wha!

150
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,575
What should I do? What should I do?
Tell me quick.

151
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,292
Oh, no need to panic.

152
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,832
There's a map to the hospital
on the back of the menu.

153
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,286
(siren wailing)

154
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,496
Try something new, Homer.

155
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,586
What will it hurt you, Homer?

156
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,882
I never heard of
a poison pork chop.

157
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,636
Um, your wife agreed that
I should break this to you.

158
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:08,848
No need, doc.

159
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,508
I can read Marge like a book.

isn't it?

162
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,140
-No, Mr. Simpson.
-Oh.

163
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,647
If in fact you've consumed
the venom of the blowfish--

164
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,649
and from what the chef has
told me, it's quite probable--

165
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,742
You have 24 hours to live.

166
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,489
-24 hours!
-Well, 22.

167
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,992
I'm sorry
I kept you waiting so long.

168
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,413
Oh, Marge

169
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,371
I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.

(sobbing)

171
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,541
Well, if there's
one consolation

172
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,121
it's that you'll feel
no pain at all

173
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,417
until some time
tomorrow evening

174
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,250
when your heart
suddenly explodes.

175
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,745
Now a little death anxiety
is normal.

176
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,588
You can expect to go through
five stages.

177
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:46,973
The first is denial.

178
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,799
No way,
because I'm not dying.

179
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,385
-Second is anger.
-Why, you little--

180
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,140
(stammering)

181
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,391
Then after that
comes fear.

182
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,063
What's after fear?
What's after fear?

183
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,101
-Bargaining.
-Doc, you gotta get me out of this.

184
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,305
I'll make it
worth your while.

185
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,984
And finally, acceptance.

186
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,152
Well, we all got to go sometime.

187
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,151
Mr. Simpson, your progress
astounds me.

188
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,283
I should leave you two alone.

189
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,070
Perhaps this pamphlet
will be helpful.

190
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,065
(Homer reading)

191
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,461
(sobbing)

192
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,211
Hello, Marge, hello.

193
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,554
I'm the one who's
dying, not you.

194
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,720
(sniffles)
Oh, I'm sorry, Homer.

195
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,429
Have you thought
about what you want

196
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,590
to tell the kids?

197
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,757
Nothing.
It'll just upset them.

198
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,466
I want my last hours
of family life

199
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,136
to be happy ones.

200
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,975
Well, have you decided
what you want to do tomorrow?

201
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:41,982
Almost.

202
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,153
(Marge muttering)

203
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,692
Oh, good. Aw!

204
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,316
I'm not done yet, Marge.

205
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:53,664
What's that word you use
for when you and I--

206
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,291
-You know.
-When we're intimate?

207
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,449
Be intimate with Marge.

208
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,038
Aw... Can I just make
one suggestion?

209
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,793
Can we get up early and
watch the sunrise together?

210
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,206
Ah... watch the sunrise.

211
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,876
Till 6:00 a.m.,
my dearest darling,

212
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,258
and my last day
on Earth.

213
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,847
(alarm beeping)

214
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,562
(snoring)

215
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,864
11:30!

216
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,531
Oh, that's just great.

217
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,859
Marge, why did you
let me sleep so late?

218
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,485
You looked so peaceful
lying there.

219
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,912
There'll be plenty
of time for that!

220
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,581
I got tons of important
stuff to do.

221
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,079
Bart. Bart!

222
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,290
"Have man-to-man with Bart."

223
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,665
Come here, boy.

224
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,709
Oh, man.

225
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,455
No!

226
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,875
I just want to have
a heart-to-heart talk.

227
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,174
-Oh.
-You know, Bart,

228
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,258
after me, you're the man
around the house.

229
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,553
And that means you're
gonna have to help out--

230
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,217
Aw, come on, I do
plenty around here.

231
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,056
Lisa never lifts a finger
Why don't you go yell at her?

232
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,481
Shut up, Bart!
This is good stuff.

233
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,441
I want to share
something with you.

234
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,441
The three little sentences that
will get you through life.

235
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,994
Number one--
Cover for me.

236
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,488
Number two--
Oh, good idea, boss.

237
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,991
Number three--

238
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,822
It was like that
when I got here.

239
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,987
-Hey, this is good stuff.
-Told 'ya. Now c'mon.

240
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,366
You're going to learn
how to shave.

241
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:25,923
And finally, the little spot
under your nose.

242
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,090
Next, we take
some toilet paper,

243
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,210
tear off some
teensy little squares

244
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,967
and stick one there...
and there...

245
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,681
and anyplace
you're bleeding.

246
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,261
There and there.
Don't worry.

247
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,176
The blood will hold it
right on your face.

248
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,394
And now... some aftershave.

249
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,596
Oooh! Ahh! Eee! Ahhh!

250
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,436

Ooh, ahh!

251

00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,984
-And that's how we shave.
-Ooh--

-Why, you little--

255
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,414
It was like that
when I got here.

00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,739

Well, Maggie,
you're grown up now,

309
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,284
and unless you taped over this,
you're probably wondering

310
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,533
what kind of man
your father was.

311
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,616
He was a simple man.
A kind man.

312

his children and--

Who is this?

00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,252
Bart's friend, Milhouse?

Oh, it's you.
What do you want?

321
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,934
Dad, we've never been
too close, have we?

322
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,225
Not to my knowledge.

323
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,098
Never went fishing
or played catch

324
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,055
or even hugged each other.

325
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,185
We never danced
the hootchy-koo either.

326
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,861
What's your point?

327
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,570

I just want you to know

328
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,241

Well, I got to go.

336
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,086
Oh, son, no. We got a lot
of catching up to do.

337
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,259
Whaddaya say we go fishing?

338
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,668
Gee, Dad, if I wasn't on such
a tight schedule...

339
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,797

-Well, I--

340

Gee, Dad, way to hog
my last moments.

349
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,328
Just a quick game
of hacky-sack.

350
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,905
I love you, son.

351
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,418
Yeah, yeah.
Gee, the old guy's a little love-starved.

352
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:41,131
Get moving, you hunk of junk.
I gotta make up for lost time.

353
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,343

355
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,465
I'm sorry, officer.
I know I was going too fast.

356
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,305
-Just give me a ticket.
-I beg your pardon?

357
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,770
Just give me a ticket!

358
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,310
Whoa. That sounded
like an order.

359
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,904
I pay my taxes,
and they pay your salary.

360
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,860
So when I say give me a ticket,
just give me a ticket.

361
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,822
Uh-huh. Maybe we don't want
to give you a ticket.

362
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,364
Maybe we wanna haul
your butt in, wise guy.

Simpson, eh?

416
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,008
I want him in my office

Wow, of all the luck.

420
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,016

to eat my shorts.

421
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,428
Oh, Homer, come on.

422
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,727
You got time
for one last beer.

423
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,981
Please!

424
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,105
I got to call Marge.

425
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,731

426
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,067

-Hello, Moe's Tavern.

427
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,863
Birthplace of the Rob Roy.

428
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,066
Is Seymour there?
Last name Butts.

429
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,577
Just a sec.

430
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,038
Hey, is there a Butts here?

431
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,579
Seymour Butts?

432

Hey, everybody,
I want a Seymour Butts!

433
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,420

434
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,632
Oh, wait a minute.

435
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,512
Listen, you little
scum-sucking, pus bucket.

436
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,379

439
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,846
Moe, another last beer,
please.

440
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,765
(sniffles)
Guys, keep it down.

441
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,864
I got some last words.

442
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,240
I never told you this before,
but sometimes when I'm at work

443
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,648
I think of you and smile.

444
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,277
So often I think that--

445
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,834
Oh, words won't do it.
I love you, Moe.

446
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,289
Please, not in public.

447
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,749
You better be dying.

448
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,869
I love you, Barney.

449
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,785
Whoa! How European.

450

-(belches)
-(screams)

451
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,713
C'mon, Barney.
I got to get home.

452
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,843
Faster, Barney, faster.

453
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,012
I'm twirling
as fast as I can.

454
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,259
Oh, I can't wait any longer.

455
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,604
Hold on, Marge.

456
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,179
I'm coming home, baby!

457
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,345

458
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,893
Come on, come on.

459
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,899
Oh, where can he be?

460
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,901
Marge! Marge!

461
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,565
Homer!

462
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,783
There's no time
to explain.

463
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,493
Love you, love you,
love you.

465
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,788
I wrote a poem for you
this afternoon, Homer.

466
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,749
It's called "To a Husband."

467
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,959
Okay, okay.

468
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,328

469
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,325
"The blackened clouds
are forming..."

470
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,537
Oh, give me a break, Marge.

471
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,456
"Soon the rain
will fall.

472
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,205

473
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:37,627

484
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,013
I like your sheets.

485
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,684

486
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,064

487
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:29,141

Hmm...

517
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,684
His drool--
it's warm.

518
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,263
He's alive!

519
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,726
Homer! Homer, wake up!
You're alive!

520
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,098
-Marge, stop it. Cut it out.
-Wake up, you're alive!

00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,101
What are you
talking about?

523
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,437
-You're alive!
-I'm alive!

524
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,573
I'm alive,
and I couldn't be happier!

525
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,691
(laughing)

526
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:01,987
From this day forward,

527
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,570
I vow to live life
to its fullest.

528
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,946
(crunching)

529
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,825
{\an8}COMMENTATOR 1(on TV):
<i>Strike! That's three in a row.</i>

530
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,581
{\an8}COMMENTATOR 2: <i>That's right.</i>
<i>Let's see that one again.</i>

531
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,463
{\an8}<i>Yeah, here we go.</i>
<i>Here he comes.</i>

532
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,130
{\an8}<i>Note the excellent</i>
<i>wrist action.</i>

533
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,129
{\an8}<i>It's just about to go</i>
<i>into the gutter</i>

534
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,261
{\an8}<i>and then a nice spin.</i>

535
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,974
{\an8}<i>-Ouch! A split.</i>
<i>-My, my.</i>

536
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,938
{\an8}<i>Well, if he makes this,</i>
<i>he'll be down by 40 pins.</i>

537
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,979
{\an8}<i>This match, though, is far</i>
<i>from over, as you know.</i>

538
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,863
{\an8}COMMENTATOR 1: <i>Yeah,</i>
<i>it is far from over</i>

539
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,069
{\an8}<i>but his approach has been</i>
<i>wrong from the beginning</i>

540
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,939
{\an8}<i>as far as I'm concerned.</i>

541
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,276
{\an8}COMMENTATOR 2: <i>Well, he's</i>
<i>an erratic bowler, Jim.</i>

542
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,741
{\an8}<i>He tends to explode</i>

543
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,160
{\an8}<i>in the seven, eight,</i>
<i>nine frames...</i>

544
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:52,119
{\an8}(pins falling,
people cheering)

545
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,714
{\an8}<i>...Moline, Illinois.</i>

546
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,079
{\an8}<i>Actually, that was</i>
<i>Pontiac, Michigan.</i>

547
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,535
{\an8}<i>38 pins going into</i>
<i>the eighth.</i>

548
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,035
{\an8}COMMENTATOR 1:
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

549
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,496
{\an8}<i>Well, uh,</i>
<i>he's stepping up now.</i>

550
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,706
{\an8}<i>In fact, he needs to get</i>
<i>at least a spare.</i>

551
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,670
Shh!
