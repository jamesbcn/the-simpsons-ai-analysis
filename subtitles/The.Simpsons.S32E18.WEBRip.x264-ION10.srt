1
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,873
<i>Here's the story</i>

2
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,843
<i>Of a fat cat</i>

3
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:46,013
<i>That no one</i>

4
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,082
<i>Really liked</i>

5
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,419
<i>His name is Monty</i>

6
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:55,222
<i>He's an old rat</i>

7
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,724
<i>And he's sleepin'</i>

8
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,993
<i>Bad tonight</i>

9
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,435
Everybody hates me.

10
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:11,305
Sir, your personal chef
is here with your breakfast.

11
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,373
VoilÃ . One raisin,

12
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,377
wrinkles ironed and smoothed,
with one molecule of sugar.

13
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,647
Too sharp.
It could cut me to ribbons.

14
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,749
Release the hounds.

15
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:26,219
No, you need a wine pairing.

16
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,855
Cabernet, to bring out
my earthiness.

17
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:31,758
Cordon bleu!

18
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,026
Smithers,

19
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,361
I need real food.

20
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,997
Something that'll stick
to my rib.

21
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:38,932
What is that delicious smell?

22
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,434
This is my lunch.

23
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,269
My wife just gave me a salad,

24
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,338
but she said I could
choose my own dressing,

25
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:47,407
so I picked this hamburger.

26
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:54,548
Seems to be some sort of meat
with a slice

27
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,884
of James Lewis Kraft's
confectionary cheese on top

28
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,955
and a kind of catsup blended
with a well-naised egg

29
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,358
in the style of Mayon.

30
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,433
I'll never let go.

31
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:20,907
I must have more of these...
What do you call them?

32
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,376
Hamburgers.

33
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,978
You're eating people
from Hamburg?

34
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:26,647
I don't know. Maybe.

35
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,385
Sir, we need to be
cautious about this.

36
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,286
It's not healthy for a man

37
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,255
to double his weight
within a day.

38
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,692
Triple!

39
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,860
No...!

40
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,271
My heart!

41
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,273
This could be
my last moment on Earth.

42
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,809
If so, fire someone
and let me watch.

43
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:58,445
Someone who just bought a house.

44
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,216
Smithers.

45
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:06,453
Oh, thank God you're alive.

46
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,387
And famished.

47
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,389
Do they serve burgers
in this joint?

48
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,925
No, sir.
Eating meat could kill you.

49
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,794
No one lives forever.

50
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,595
Except Dick Cheney.
What's his deal?

51
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,597
Sir, you nearly died.

52
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,133
I nearly died?
How was the reaction?

53
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,803
Well, when they heard
you were dying...

54
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,107
He's alive.

55
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,712
People don't like me.

56
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:32,913
They really don't.
Why?

57
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,682
You've released the hounds
on nearly everyone in town, sir.

58
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,184
Everyone loves dogs, Smithers.

59
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,819
It must be something else.

60
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,821
If you're ready, come.

61
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,356
The cue will be life.

62
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,627
Smithers, this means that no one
will mourn me when I'm gone.

63
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,830
My only legacy
will be the extra radiation

64
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,299
on every drop of water on Earth.

65
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,101
- Don't give up, sir.
- No, I give up.

66
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,167
Don't give up.

67
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:56,369
- I give up.
- Don't give up.

68
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,204
I give up.

69
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,472
- Don't give up.
- Seriously,

70
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,406
I give up.

71
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,041
Will you listen to me
for one minute?

72
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,076
Sir, I figured out a way
to add to your legacy

73
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:06,613
and extend your life.

74
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,084
The professor here
has used exotic plants

75
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:14,254
to develop what I think
is the healthiest, tastiest

76
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,323
meatless burger ever.

77
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,958
You could eat
as many as you want

78
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,526
and we can
sell them at a profit.

79
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:23,463
Not here. Not here, please.
I've told you about this.

80
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,070
Oh, do you know how Edison felt

81
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:32,205
on that incredible,
magical night?

82
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,974
When he invented the light bulb?

83
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,776
No.
The electric chair.

84
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,477
That's how I feel now.

85
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,955
Smithers, this could
change my legacy.

86
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,681
People have to like the person
who made them live longer.

87
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,016
They have to.

88
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,117
What are you saying, sir?

89
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,285
I'm going to make it

90
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,954
to what
I never thought possible...

91
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,723
Beloved after death.

92
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,159
Look at me, world.

93
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,867
We'll do a sneak preview
of your burger chain

94
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,202
and then a grand opening

95
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,204
of a thousand stores
across the country.

96
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,972
Now all we need is a name.

97
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,073
Excellent.

98
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,576
You've done it again, sir.

99
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,913
We're here to cover

100
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,781
the sneak preview
of our new sponsor,

101
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,016
X-Cell-Ent Burger.

102
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,851
I... I'm just getting word

103
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,354
Springfield Dam has ruptured
and water is roaring down.

104
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,057
We'll let the
sad news cover that.

105
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,625
I'm here live at...

106
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,930
He was a good reporter,
great parking spot.

107
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,499
But let's move on
from grief to beef.

108
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:35,969
The first paying customer
to taste the X-Cell-Ent Burger

109
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,470
will be...

110
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,675
Number 43.

111
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:42,843
That's me.

112
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,077
But I warn you,

113
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:47,214
I've had every plant-based meat
ever made.

114
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,615
Phony Baloney,

115
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:49,616
Not Wurst,

116
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,817
Faux Foie Gras,

117
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,686
Corned Beets On Rye,

118
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,154
and Ghost Beef.

119
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,756
Good luck pleasing me.

120
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,573
So, what do you think?

121
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,041
It tastes great!

122
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,245
And no animal has passed gas
in its making.

123
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,414
This burger
might just save the world.

124
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,284
Thank you.

125
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,754
Thank you.

126
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,756
You're letting me cut the line?

127
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:30,924
Oh, thank you.

128
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,292
I don't have to cook.

129
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,594
I can finally
teach Maggie to talk.

130
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:38,331
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.

131
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,739
Praise, praise...
something I've craved

132
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,641
since I was a little boy.

133
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,912
I drew this picture
of you hugging me, Mummy.

134
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,047
I don't like art that lies.

135
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,583
Oh, and by the way,
your father's dead.

136
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,686
There's just
one more thing we need.

137
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,620
A spokesman.

138
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,756
If we find a regular slob
who loves it,

139
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,524
we can start a chain reaction.

140
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,393
Just like...

141
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,394
Nuclear fission?

142
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,763
Is that how that works?
Really?

143
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,398
Now to find our slob.

144
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,566
My card.

145
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,273
Smithers,
keep your nods to yourself.

146
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,107
Yes, sir.

147
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,676
Since we're using
a green screen,

148
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,210
do I have to be this high up?

149
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,013
- We need the chance of death.
- Before we film,

150
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,381
we need you
to sign this contract

151
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,488
stating that what you
publicly say about our product

152
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,218
is limited
to certain catchphrases.

153
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,422
Approved phrases limited to...

154
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:36,623
yes ve-gan,

155
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,958
I guaran-tree it,

156
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,225
abso-lettuce,

157
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,627
and the meat beater.

158
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,163
Every one of those
has two meanings.

159
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,198
Your ad guys are geniuses.

160
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:48,201
If I could be
a fly on the wall...

161
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,372
My kids!

162
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:56,242
Oh, I got to put
all these kids through garbage?

163
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,244
Now, listen,
if you break this contract,

164
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:02,048
we'll release the hounds, who will
bite you here, here, here and here.

165
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,017
And here in triplicate.

166
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,423
Okay, Homer, let's try a take.

167
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,524
Action.

168
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,693
They say I'm eating healthy.

169
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,661
They say I'm saving the planet.

170
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,463
But here is my secret,

171
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:20,633
it tastes like
it was scared to die.

172
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,068
The X-Cell-Ent Burger.

173
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,070
Coming soon
to a location near you.

174
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,339
The fate of the world
is in your mouth.

175
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,207
With all these commercials,

176
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,210
I'm afraid your father's
going to need bigger pants.

177
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,547
Alexa, do you have
any X-X-X-X

178
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:38,351
X-X-X-XL in stock?

179
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,319
I found XLN stock.

180
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,421
How much would you like to buy?

181
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,257
I don't know.

182
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,825
How's ten pairs?

183
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:49,328
Submitting order for
a thousand shares of XLN stock.

184
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:50,863
Please confirm.

185
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,533
- Confirm?
- Ignoring question mark.

186
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,468
Buy order executed.

187
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,003
Oh, no.

188
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:01,107
Maggie. I accidentally
bought X-Cell-Ent Burger stock.

189
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,109
Alexa, sell those stocks.

190
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,378
Ordering yellow socks.

191
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,046
You get everything wrong.

192
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,915
We'll switch to Siri.

193
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,583
Siri enabled.

194
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,185
You sound like Alexa.

195
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,558
X-Cell-Ent Burger.

196
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,760
Well, they seem
to be succeeding.

197
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,762
But I'd feel awful
if the stock went...

198
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,897
Up? It just went up.

199
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,198
We made money!

200
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:29,502
Seven hundred dollars!

201
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,737
What I could buy
with that money.

202
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:36,142
Now it's down. Down $200.

203
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,710
Up again.

204
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,879
Down again.

205
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,214
The grand opening's in a week,
sir, and the reviews

206
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,883
couldn't be better.

207
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,586
Smithers, I'm a hero.

208
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,588
Like that guy
who landed the plane safely.

209
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:49,889
Sully Sullenberger?

210
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,058
No, no, no, no.
Rudolf Hess.

211
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,960
Smithers, a toast.

212
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,764
On it, sir.

213
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,735
I think you've had enough, sir.

214
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,972
Yes. Yes.
I'll... I'll sleep it off.

215
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,508
If it goes up another ten cents,

216
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,044
we're a thousand dollars ahead.

217
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,448
We've never been
a thousand dollars ahead.

218
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:18,250
Never.

219
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,220
Tonight on Smartline.

220
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,055
The Burger Wars.

221
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,645
They won't give me a raise,
but they can blow the bank

222
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,713
on graphics like that.

223
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,315
Leading up
to its national rollout,

224
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,652
X-Cell-Ent Burger's success
is destroying its competitors,

225
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,787
who are trying to overcome
a terrific new product

226
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,656
with desperate publicity stunts.

227
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,791
Attempting to piggyback
on Burger King's success

228
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,460
by changing its name during
Pride Month to Burger Queer,

229
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,996
Krusty has introduced
his own product...

230
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,866
The L.G.B.T.Q.B.L.T.

231
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,405
How could a ploy
this cynical and shameless fail?

232
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,375
Mel, you're
three of those letters.

233
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,677
Where did I go wrong?

234
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,645
Your product is inferior.

235
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,047
Your marketing is offensive.

236
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:24,850
And you have more ex-wives
than franchise locations.

237
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:28,454
What happened to kiss-ass Mel
who was afraid of my shadow?

238
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,756
I joined an empowerment group

239
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,225
with the monkey
and the cue card guy.

240
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,343
Aw, geez.
My hero's a loser.

241
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,512
Mr. Burns is gonna
drive Krusty out of business,

242
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,047
unless we stop him.

243
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:58,050
No. Burns is doing
something good.

244
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,585
I know it in my gut.

245
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,587
The Earth is on his side.

246
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,567
Thank you.
I love you all.

247
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,435
Disperse them
before we get back.

248
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,037
Rubber bullets, if necessary.

249
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,076
It's so wonderful
to be be-liked.

250
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:28,114
Finally, I can join the club
that rejected me so many times.

251
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,485
Welcome, welcome.

252
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,262
All the other beloved
billionaires are here.

253
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,422
There's Warren Buffet,
there's Bill Gates...

254
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,157
And that's it.

255
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,662
Mark Zuckerberg,
you get out of here.

256
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,831
No!
You can't threaten me.

257
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,166
I know all about you.

258
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,468
You're currently single,
you haven't been poked

259
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,437
in five years,
and I love those pictures

260
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,972
from your vacation to Baja,

261
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,274
where we both know
your boyfriend dumped you.

262
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,609
Those were set to private.

263
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,612
Right. Private.

264
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,587
I think I know
what Burns is up to.

265
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:11,457
His so-called vegan burgers
contain... Wait for it.

266
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,659
Are you waiting?

267
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,594
Here it is, meat.

268
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,429
What are you saying?

269
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,131
All this time
I've been eating meat?!

270
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:26,005
Oh, no,
that's why I grew an inch.

271
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,139
Just a theory.

272
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,073
Do you believe that?

273
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,776
No. I just wanted
the rest of your burger.

274
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:47,193
I don't want to see
what's inside.

275
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,061
Nerd.

276
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,166
Yep.
Just as I thought.

277
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,135
He's using plants.

278
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:58,904
Aw, crap.

279
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,774
Not meat.
Burns is doing the right thing.

280
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,386
This is kind of scary,

281
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,422
like putting on
a wet bathing suit.

282
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:19,191
Wait a minute.
Those plants look unusual.

283
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,228
They're all endangered plants

284
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,363
from the Amazon rainforest.

285
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,931
We have to tell Burns.

286
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,234
He already knows.
He's evil.

287
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,870
No. I refuse to believe
that someone can't change

288
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,872
for the better,
even though I can't think

289
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,975
of a single example
of that ever happening.

290
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,511
- Mr. Burns?
- Yes, children.

291
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:40,646
What do you want?

292
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,948
We came
to tell you something

293
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:46,118
that's maybe
a little hard to hear.

294
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,356
I'm sorry to have to inform you

295
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,458
that your attempt to do good

296
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,994
is doing very, very bad.

297
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,729
Leave me alone.

298
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,135
Oh, for God's sake.

299
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,605
- Finally.
- Mr. Burns.

300
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,674
Release the hounds.

301
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,743
You mean these hounds?

302
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:12,845
Let's be clear, young lady.

303
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,380
I'm not going to listen to you.

304
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:15,848
I'm never
going to listen to you,

305
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,516
and I have
sophisticated technology

306
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,184
to ensure that happens.

307
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,587
Buy, buy, buy!

308
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,455
Then, when you hear
a rumor of trouble,

309
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,790
sell before anyone else!

310
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,325
I'll be out of here
in four months!

311
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,795
Oh, what happened to you?

312
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,364
Come over here.
What is it, baby?

313
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,734
We have to think of a way
to shut X-Cell-Ent Burger down.

314
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,836
But what about the shareholders?

315
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,472
What? Sharehol...

316
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,784
No, no, no!

317
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,053
More money for Marge.

318
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,423
Dad, you're my last hope.

319
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,124
Tomorrow's the national launch.

320
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:02,528
If X-Cell-Ent Burger succeeds,
by the year 2080,

321
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:03,963
the entire Amazon...

322
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,998
I'm talking
the lungs of the planet...

323
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:06,932
will be gone.

324
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,767
Lisa, I'm sorry
to put it on you,

325
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,303
but every generation
has its to-do list.

326
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,573
Yours is putting Miami
on stilts, inventing new bees,

327
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,943
and learning to peacefully
live with fire tornadoes.

328
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,745
You're not gonna
help fight Burns?

329
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,547
I've learned one thing in life.

330
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,084
Don't bite the bony,
withered claw that feeds you,

331
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,320
even if there's
delicious marrow inside.

332
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,155
What was this about again?

333
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,890
You won't help save the Earth.

334
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,659
No, I won't.

335
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,461
I don't know
how you sleep at night.

336
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,963
I sleep fine, little lady!

337
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,143
Cheesy McMayor!
Jack in the Bag!

338
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,079
Guys, my company
is doing something bad.

339
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,247
Should I tell the world?

340
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:58,550
Look what eating only
my own food has done to me.

341
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,185
Look at me!

342
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,657
<i>You're a spokesman</i>

343
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,227
<i>For a franchise</i>

344
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,763
<i>That's clear-cutting</i>

345
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,400
<i>Left and right</i>

346
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,236
<i>You have sold out</i>

347
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:20,205
<i>All your values</i>

348
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,174
<i>I won't let you</i>

349
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,543
<i>Sleep tonight</i>

350
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,087
Once again,
dreams have taught me

351
00:17:36,154 --> 00:17:38,089
more than
all the books ever written.

352
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:40,191
I know what I have to do.

353
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,264
What's going on?
Why is everyone baring

354
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,700
- their teeth at me?
- They're smiling, sir.

355
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,068
They can't wait to see you.

356
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,137
Oh, just so I know,

357
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:53,505
to be considered good

358
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,408
I now have to continue
doing good things?

359
00:17:56,474 --> 00:17:57,474
Yes.

360
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,377
That's why Jesus retired at 33,

361
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:01,513
without a fast-food franchise
to his name,

362
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,416
except maybe Chick-fil-A.
Well, let's get on with

363
00:18:04,482 --> 00:18:06,751
my ascension into
sainthood, Smithers.

364
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:08,887
I'm gonna bring them down.

365
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,389
Are you sure?
Think of the shareholders.

366
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:15,160
For once, I say
damn the shareholders.

367
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:17,062
Simpson.
After the announcement,

368
00:18:17,128 --> 00:18:18,639
there will be questions
from the audience,

369
00:18:18,663 --> 00:18:20,632
but like our burgers,
the questioners will be

370
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,500
entirely made up of plants.

371
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,302
I'm ready.

372
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,471
And you do remember
your non-disclosure agreement?

373
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:29,240
I believe it said
something to the effect of...

374
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:31,776
I was limited
to certain words and phrases,

375
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:34,913
and I couldn't make obscene
gestures with my hands.

376
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,548
Or...

377
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,183
- Crotch.
- Excellent.

378
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:40,919
Excellent.

379
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:45,490
Mr. Simpson
will now take questions.

380
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:49,194
Yes. The little girl
in the mustache.

381
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,328
Thank you, sir.

382
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,163
Is it true
that X-Cell-Ent Burgers

383
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,566
are made of plants
from the rainforest?

384
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:59,571
Abso-lettuce.

385
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:02,907
And what are the chances

386
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:04,442
that your product will help lead

387
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:06,711
to the destruction
of the planet?

388
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,448
I guaran-tree it.

389
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:15,253
He's using legal loopholes
to tell us the truth.

390
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:19,057
A supersize admission
in the burger wars.

391
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,526
Have we been fed
an order of lies, or worse...

392
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:22,761
curly lies?

393
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:24,062
Good God, I'm hungry.

394
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,801
I did it again.
I won by doing nothing.

395
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,169
That's my hero.

396
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:32,737
Always will be.

397
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,372
Round up some more donkeys.

398
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,675
We're in
the burger business again.

399
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:39,144
Mom, I'm so conflicted.

400
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,745
You're conflicted?

401
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,815
I feel like someone who knew
a stock was about to crash,

402
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:47,152
sold it before that happened,
and kept a thousand dollars.

403
00:19:47,218 --> 00:19:48,286
What are you saying?

404
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,355
Nothing.
Nothing, nothing.

405
00:19:52,757 --> 00:19:54,092
This is the time

406
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:56,294
he really needs you
to look at him.

407
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,369
- Sir. You're happy.
- Yes.

408
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,105
Because I'm no longer
crushed by morality.

409
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,374
I gave it a nice go,
almost a full month...

410
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,077
but in the end,
evil always wins.

411
00:20:12,143 --> 00:20:13,945
Would you like to go
to a school for the blind

412
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,847
and convince them
aliens have landed?

413
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,450
I'd like that.

414
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,962
<i>You listened</i>

415
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,898
<i>To your conscience</i>

416
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:35,734
<i>And now you're</i>

417
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,104
<i>Feelin' fine</i>

418
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,574
<i>And you're dreamin'</i>

419
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,677
<i>Of me singin'</i>

420
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,811
<i>'Cause you drank</i>

421
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:50,381
<i>Two-dollar wine</i>

422
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,752
Tell me when it hurts.

423
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:56,888
It hurt from the beginning!
