1
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:06,267
D'oh!

2
00:01:58,152 --> 00:01:59,587
This is Kent Brockman
on location

3
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,622
among the good people
of Springfield.

4
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,458
Coward!

5
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:07,361
Because today, we celebrate
beautiful Skyline Park,

6
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:09,029
a reclamation project
built atop the ruins

7
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,432
of the Springfield Monorail.

8
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,202
Monorail.
Monorail. Monorail. Monorail.

9
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:16,670
No, they're not building
a new monorail.

10
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,672
Why not?
This one couldn't fail.

11
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:20,274
Couldn't fail. Couldn't fail.

12
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:22,443
<i>It's a monstrous creation</i>

13
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,044
<i>Of mass transportation</i>

14
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,218
Throw me again!

15
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,520
No, we're repurposing
the old monorail track

16
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,622
into a completely new
and original feature

17
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,123
we ripped off from New York.

18
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,893
The Springfield Skypark-Line.

19
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:41,329
I love this space.

20
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:43,163
Planters, benches,

21
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:46,834
solar-powered
talking trash cans.

22
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:50,338
Thank you for the used porn.

23
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:01,048
Okay, do we go...

24
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,584
gut to gut or
butt-butt to nut?

25
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:06,354
Don't worry,
we'll use the bypass board.

26
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:09,490
Okay, fatsos, suck it in.

27
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,197
I got Homer's sandwich.

28
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,832
I got Wiggum's gun.

29
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,101
And now, to culminate
today's events,

30
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,703
let's turn on the electricity

31
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,773
that illuminates
the tiny no smoking signs.

32
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,753
Huh? Somehow the track
is getting juice!

33
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,825
Yes! Now to put it
on power save.

34
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,396
The monorail, it's alive!

35
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:49,897
I warned you not to...

36
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,119
Welcome, senior citizen.

37
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:22,796
No more Nimoy!

38
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,403
On the positive side,
with this disaster,

39
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:32,005
we have surpassed
Detroit and Kabul

40
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,074
as the world's
most unlucky city.

41
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:39,680
Couldn't you have at least put
little wedges under the wheels?

42
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,516
Sorry, sweetheart,
but running a city is

43
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,186
a little more complicated
than getting your nails done.

44
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,088
Don't you worry

45
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,190
your pretty little head
about it.

46
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,760
Mr. Mayor, that is so sexist.

47
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,196
Sounds like someone's
girdle is pinching.

48
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,700
Well, now, it's all in fun.

49
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,869
No one respects you ladies
more than I.

50
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:04,204
Now if you wouldn't mind
serving the coffee and cake,

51
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,206
we men can get down to business.

52
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,510
This is the last time
I'm doing this.

53
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,345
So I better do it perfectly.

54
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:13,481
Here you go, Dr. Hibbert.

55
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:18,952
I can't believe Mayor Quimby
talking down to me like that.

56
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,722
And by the way, women don't
wear girdles anymore.

57
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:24,392
We wear Spanx
and other shapewear.

58
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,926
Tell me about it.

59
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,067
People think we've moved on, but
this world is as sexist as ever.

60
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,636
Thanks, Obama.

61
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,571
What's so great
about Quimby anyway?

62
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:38,972
I could cut a ribbon.

63
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,574
And I could make it curl nicely

64
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:42,910
using the edge
of the giant scissors.

65
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,078
You'd be a great mayor, Mom.

66
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,914
You're organized,
you manage the budget,

67
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:50,250
and thanks to Dad, you're
an expert on the court system.

68
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,753
Fun fact, being a defendant
gets you out of jury duty.

69
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,089
Mom, this is our time.

70
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,158
Wonder Woman showed
that if you're a goddess

71
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,395
with superpowers, there's
no limit to what you can do.

72
00:06:01,429 --> 00:06:03,363
You could be mayor!

73
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,167
A woman prime minister, okay.

74
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,102
Women Ghostbusters, cool.

75
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:10,738
Woman head of
the Federal Reserve,

76
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,906
as far as I'm concerned,
what's that?

77
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,408
But a woman mayor?

78
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:17,945
If Mom becomes mayor,
we can get away with anything.

79
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:23,083
Help me, Jesus!

80
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:30,691
Pick a side.

81
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,265
Hey.
Where'd everybody go?

82
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:41,469
Marge, this town
is ready for a change.

83
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,737
Quimby has been mayor,
like, forever.

84
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:45,573
You'd think he could
lose that sash.

85
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,641
It's like, we know, okay?

86
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:48,976
All right now, listen.

87
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,078
The key to victory
is micro-targeting.

88
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,446
Micro-targeting.

89
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,548
Think of the voters as a pie.

90
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,151
Yes, Homer,
someone here said pie.

91
00:06:58,185 --> 00:06:59,820
I know, mm, pie.

92
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,756
I'm sorry, go on.

93
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,494
We use data analysis
to divide the pie

94
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,161
into tiny little slivers

95
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:10,631
and tailor a message
to each micro-group.

96
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:15,168
You just tell them what they
want to hear until you get 51%.

97
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:18,171
Then you can govern
like a far-right nut-job.

98
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:21,509
<i>I'm Marge Simpson</i>

99
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,844
<i>And won't you vote for me?</i>

100
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,514
<i>Whatever your obsession is</i>

101
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:29,016
<i>Is my priority</i>

102
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:32,520
I stand with you
against revenuers.

103
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:35,188
Oh, durn revenuers!

104
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:37,858
Well, you's the new John Galt,
aren't you?

105
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:41,962
Hey, can you take a picture
with our Ayn Rand scarecrow?

106
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,368
<i>From widows
to your lunch pail Joes</i>

107
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,871
<i>To vets of foreign wars</i>

108
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:53,140
<i>There's no
single-issue voter</i>

109
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,943
<i>My campaign will ignore</i>

110
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,145
Marge, we really
appreciate this.

111
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:01,014
You're the first politician
that's ever met with us weirdos.

112
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:04,552
What's the biggest issue
you exotic pet owners face?

113
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,654
Keeping our pets
from eating each other.

114
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:09,189
Yes. As the owner
of an impala, I...

115
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,625
- Hey, where'd it go?
- Oh, boy.

116
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:14,895
<i>From soccer moms
to mafia dons</i>

117
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,698
<i>I'll give you what you need</i>

118
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:20,000
<i>I'm Marge Simpson</i>

119
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,770
<i>And won't you vote for me?
Yeah!</i>

120
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,906
Why do people assume
all I can do

121
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:29,009
is feed spaghetti to dogs
that want to make out?

122
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,343
What do you want to do?

123
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:33,246
Carve a little wooden boy
and make him come to life.

124
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,158
Now, for our third and fourth
party candidates,

125
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:48,596
I regret to say you are just shy
of the polling results required,

126
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,430
so you're excluded
from the debate.

127
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,332
Bye-bye.

128
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,068
Mrs. Simpson, you've targeted
small constituencies.

129
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:57,070
Do you have any proposals
that would appeal

130
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,872
to every Springfielder?

131
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,275
Well, Kent, I am a mom.

132
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:06,947
And as a mom, I want to help
this town eat its vegetables.

133
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,618
Vegetables, Marge?

134
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:12,620
As moderator,
it's my duty to fact check

135
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,387
that many of them are yucky.

136
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:15,956
It's a metaphor.

137
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,457
Stinkin' metaphors!

138
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,426
I only trust similes.

139
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,928
I enjoy metaphors.

140
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,430
They're raindrops on the flower
that is the ear.

141
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,298
You put in a like or an as,

142
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:27,434
or so help me
you are going down.

143
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:31,972
She's completely cooked.

144
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,574
Unlike the chicken
she brought to the potluck.

145
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:36,877
Oh, Helen is
as bitter as the lemonade

146
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,311
she brought to the potluck.

147
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:41,414
What a terrible potluck
that was.

148
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,951
Why wasn't this
a town hall event?

149
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:46,854
I like to see them
balance on the stools.

150
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,826
You know, my entire life,

151
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,495
that stupid tire fire
has been burning.

152
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,397
And it's ruined our town.

153
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,302
I promise, if you elect me,

154
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,237
I'll put that fire out.

155
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,141
No tire fire?

156
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,843
Ooh, just like Zurich.

157
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,751
Is that enough?

158
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:19,853
And with the last senior citizen
gently reminded

159
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:23,190
that they cannot vote at IHOP,
the results are now final.

160
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,524
History is made.

161
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,493
Marge Simpson is our new mayor.

162
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:30,030
The first woman and the second
to pee sitting down.

163
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:32,365
Marge! Marge! Marge!

164
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,901
Thank you.

165
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:38,138
Homie, you want to make out
with the mayor?

166
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,708
What? No! Ew!

167
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,876
Oh, you mean you.

168
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:47,047
Okay.

169
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,581
Now I really wish I'd voted.

170
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,661
Look at me!
I'm a public servant!

171
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:06,233
And so our new mayor
is doing what was unthinkable

172
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,802
in the Quimby regime, something.

173
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:11,104
Roll the 'dozers!

174
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,914
Well, sorry,

175
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:24,384
but I can't let you
put me out of business.

176
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:30,924
You'd ruin the air for the whole
town just to sell knickknacks?

177
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,092
Knickknacks?

178
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,894
They may be to you,

179
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:37,064
but they put my son
through med school.

180
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:40,167
He named a stammer after me.

181
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,837
You know.

182
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:46,774
I failed.

183
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,876
I failed on my one promise.

184
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,613
And so, Marge Simpson
is already a failure.

185
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,383
The fastest fall from grace
since Mamie Eisenhower

186
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,152
destroyed a piano store
on inauguration day.

187
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,591
Hey, Mom,
want to get some lunch?

188
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,193
I'd love a lunch break,

189
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,296
but I've got to get
that tire fire out first.

190
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,365
Already neglecting your family,
Madam Mayor?

191
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,902
Why you little!
Don't embarrass your mother!

192
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,752
Guys, guys, stop!

193
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:33,921
I'm the mayor.

194
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:35,989
Everything you do
reflects on me.

195
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:37,324
Of course, honey.

196
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,159
It's just hard
to restrain yourself

197
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,828
when you're above the law.

198
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,662
We're not above the law.

199
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,232
Oh, yeah, yeah, I get it.

200
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,668
I want you to promise me.

201
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:52,172
Can you both behave like Lisa,
just for a little bit?

202
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:55,608
I'm Lisa. I'm Lisa.

203
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,610
I like music.

204
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:00,247
My boyfriend is broccoli.

205
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,582
Hey!

206
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,185
We're here to buy your stand.

207
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,520
Yeah, well, it's not for sale.

208
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:10,257
All I want to do
is help this city,

209
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,759
and I can't because of
this ding-dong.

210
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:16,363
How dare you
insult me like that?

211
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:17,697
I was there!

212
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,133
What?
What, what, what, what, what?

213
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,835
Clyde's a Vietnam vet,

214
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:24,204
a survivor of
the Battle of Dhing Dhong.

215
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:25,305
Thank you.

216
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,174
Than Kyu was his best friend.

217
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:30,010
Stepped on a land mine in
the battle of One Pun Too Many.

218
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:32,212
This is not good, Marge.
Not good.

219
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,883
Marge's beehive of activity
has become

220
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,684
a hornet's nest of trouble.

221
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:40,553
Also, our news broadcasts have
been reduced to two sentences.

222
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:41,721
Good night.

223
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,056
There's only one way out.

224
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,624
You're gonna have to do a live,

225
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,160
completely unscripted
heart-to-heart with the voters.

226
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:49,496
- Here's your script.
- I don't want a script.

227
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,763
Are you nuts?

228
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,200
Good evening.

229
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,735
I'm here to talk to you,
one-on-one,

230
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,939
just an ordinary mom
sitting in her kitchen.

231
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:01,909
This is a disaster.

232
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,977
I've seen counterclockwise
knob turning before,

233
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,345
but not like this.

234
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,382
Marge, what time
is dinner ready?

235
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,351
I'm in the middle of a speech.

236
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,852
So, 6:00?

237
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,487
You'll get it when you get it.

238
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,924
Wait a minute.
Something's turning them around.

239
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:20,427
Marge, can you cook
a Hot Pocket in the dryer?

240
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,395
Homer Simpson,

241
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:25,665
the only time you shut your
mouth is to keep food inside.

242
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,338
That's it.

243
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,940
She's turned
a gaffe-making tubby

244
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,374
into a laugh-yielding hubby.

245
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,943
Does that work?

246
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,945
Let's see,
the subter-hand is all right.

247
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:40,113
The math checks out.

248
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:42,249
I'll be the Kellyanne Conway
of this thing.

249
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:43,550
Kellyanne Conway?

250
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,053
I like how she always
looks like she just woke up.

251
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:50,123
I think it's inspiring how now
a woman can be Joseph Goebbels.

252
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:55,795
Marge, do we have any bread?

253
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,130
Check your chest.

254
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:02,635
Oh, my God.

255
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,137
Those are the highest
approval ratings

256
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:07,174
I've ever seen
for an incumbent, 53%!

257
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,749
Marge, your numbers
are simply fantastic.

258
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,686
And all you had to do was throw
your husband under the bus.

259
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,089
Well, don't tell me you're sad

260
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,756
about throwing your husband
under the bus.

261
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,259
I'm happy if he can
fit under a bus.

262
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:27,427
Zing!

263
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,030
Yeah. Zing.

264
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,402
Mr. Simpson, we're naming
a sandwich after you.

265
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,904
My lifelong dream
has come true.

266
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,339
I've got this all planned.

267
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:42,142
Start with a full Reuben
with all the fixin's.

268
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,910
Put a club sandwich on top.

269
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,912
The bottom bun is,
at first glance,

270
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,981
a chicken-fried steak.

271
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:49,849
But it's worth a closer look,
because...

272
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,419
Sir, sir, sir.
We've already made it.

273
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,922
The Open-Mouthed
Turkey Goofball?

274
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,425
That is so not me.

275
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,527
But I'll take six.

276
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,196
We're honored to have
with us the mayor...

277
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:07,700
and First Doofus
Homer Simpson.

278
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:13,840
Homer's made Marge happy more
times than he can count, three!

279
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:18,045
And we're here for
a very, very serious charity...

280
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:19,546
Save the Whales.

281
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,681
All right, that's it!

282
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,983
No. That's really
why we're here!

283
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,187
I am not a whale!

284
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,557
I am a man with blubber
and several harpoon scars!

285
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,871
What a day for this town.

286
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:47,840
We've made a deal
with the librarians' union.

287
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,043
Homer would've been here,

288
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:51,978
but he backed out
when he heard the library

289
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,713
didn't have any pop-up books.

290
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,226
Great news, Marge.
You've tapped into something

291
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:09,862
women and men can agree on,
husbands are idiots.

292
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,231
Yeah, I guess.

293
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,865
While you're guessing,
I'm running with this.

294
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:14,567
Take a look at
the balloon we've made

295
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:15,868
for the Thanksgiving parade.

296
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,272
I don't care what people say.

297
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:22,542
My Homie makes one sexy blimp.

298
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,813
I need to talk to somebody.

299
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:35,122
Mayor Quimby?

300
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:38,425
No, just ordinary Diamond Joe.

301
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,926
I know that look.

302
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:43,096
That's a mayor on the ropes
or a wife who wants a divorce.

303
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,564
I'm familiar with both.

304
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,065
Indeed.

305
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:49,769
Joe, is it possible to have
a decent family life

306
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,904
and be a good political leader?

307
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,107
Marge, I don't want
to talk about that anymore,

308
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:57,110
but I'll tell you this,
retirement agrees with me.

309
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:58,611
The first night out of office,

310
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:01,114
I noticed a gorgeous woman
lying next to me,

311
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:04,284
and I said, holy crap,
I'm married to her.

312
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,286
Go long, boys.

313
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:14,494
Marge, there's no mayor
in marriage.

314
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,629
There almost is.
It's really close.

315
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:17,964
But I'm afraid not.

316
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,433
Meet you in the boathouse later?

317
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,436
Oh, Marge, I want to thank you

318
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,172
for giving me back my Joseph.

319
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:26,306
Will you stay?

320
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,575
I just made a giant pitcher
of gimlets,

321
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,843
but I can make a second one
if you're staying.

322
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:32,412
No, I have to get back.

323
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,782
We're christening a new
manhole cover on 4th Street.

324
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,285
So sad.

325
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,652
Can't you stay for a bit?

326
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:42,655
We need some help
serving coffee and cake.

327
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:45,425
I swear this is the last time.

328
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,460
There's more
where that came from!

329
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,666
Thank you. I couldn't be here
without my husband.

330
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,504
He's a big supporter.

331
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:58,971
So big...

332
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,386
So big, I wish all of you could

333
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,388
know the love in his heart.

334
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,525
Everyone, look inside yourself

335
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:21,828
and find your Homer Simpson.

336
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:33,740
It's so beautiful.

337
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:38,778
We make the magic happen, baby.

338
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,167
Can we just skip that one?

339
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,236
I would, but you have
to walk through it

340
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,737
to get to the cafeteria.

341
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,439
Okay.
