Would you excuse us, Milton?

347
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,725
It's Milhouse.

348
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,644
Yeah, and your father's
no house. Now, scram.

349
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,165
(GROANS)

350
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,522
Maybe I was a little
hard on him. Oh, well.

351
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,648
Bart, I know
a father has no right to

352
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,888
pry into the life of
his 10-year-old son.

353
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,041
But what's going
on up here?

354
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,929
I'm just spreading
the <i>Playdude</i> philosophy.

355
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,367
Hi-fi's, Norman Mailer,
getting some.

356
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,811
Uh, um...

357
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,729
What do you think "some" is?

358
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,841
Uh,

359
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,246
toys?

360
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,241
(SIGHS) I thought I'd
never have to do this,

361
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,761
but it's time to tell
you the facts of life.

362
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,646
Do you know what a boob is?

363
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,086
Oh, yeah.

364
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,851
Good. That'll save
us some time. Okay.

365
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,720
Why do you think your mother
and I sleep in the same bed?

366
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,086
Because we're poor?

367
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,361
Exactly.

368
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,283
And we're poor
because we have kids.

369
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,449
And the biological
method by which

370
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,046
children are created
by a man and a woman is...

371
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,769
(BART SCREAMS)

372
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,926
BART: Then the man...

(KIDS SCREAM)

374
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,650
BART AND MILLHOUSE:
Then the woman...

(KIDS SCREAMING)

377
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,802
(SCREAMING)
Well, it's better
they hear it from me now

378
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,962
than from their parents
when they're old enough.

379
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,170
Congratulations, Mom.

380
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,005
You seem to have
a prescription for success.

381
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,442
What a kind yet oddly
ominous thing to say.

382
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,443
Now, I've gotta get
ready for the finals.

383
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,682
Don't forget your
secret ingredient.

384
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,366
Cheating.

385
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,129
Well, it's not my fault.

386
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,283
Lisa, the people
in this bakeoff are stinkers

387
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,728
who pushed me
and pushed me like
the pushy-wushies they are.

388
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,447
Mom, if I don't
have you to look up to,
I don't have anyone.

389
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,765
Look, I'll be a winner
with feet of clay
like Mickey Mantle.

390
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,285
Everyone loves the Mick.

391
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,045
I don't want Mickey Mantle.
I want my mom.

392
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,487
Hey, plenty of kids
are gonna look up to me

393
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,961
when I'm Auntie
whatever it is.

394
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,325
Right now, people just know me
as the wife of a guy

395
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,323
who doesn't go to work.

396
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,449
Can't you understand
that I need this?

397
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,521
(SIGHS)

398
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,080
I guess Dad has
to be my hero now.

399
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,485
Not if you knew
what he's been doing.
(SHUDDERS)

400
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,771
Welcome to the final battle
of the Ovenfresh Challenge.

401
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,844
Ooh, she's already
ahead of me.

402
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,450
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

403
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,166
Well, I didn't come
this far not to cheat.

404
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,966
Huh?

405
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,651
(MARGE READING)

406
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,921
That's clever and devastating.

407
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,360
(GROANS)

408
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,930
Stop the competition.

409
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,206
(ALL GASP)

410
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,362
I don't deserve to win.

411
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,126
I sabotaged all
the other entries.

(GASPING)

413
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,568
Looks like me and Marge
are both going to hell.

414
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,210
That's where
I'll make my move.

415
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,127
Then I won with my festive
Holiday Alco-Hog.

(RETCHING)

417
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,924
Huh! I thought it was dead.

418
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,810
Mmm.

419
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,406
Thanks, honey,
for saving me from myself.

420
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,401
And, Marge, you'll always be
the best chef in our house.

421
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,411
(SIGHS) BFD.

422
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,164
I've had your
scrambled eggs, Homer.

423
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,004
The secret
ingredient is whiskey.

424
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,128
Hey, it keeps the kids quiet.

425
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,480
Hey, look.
The new Ovenfresh Flour bag.

426
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,569
Ah, that could've been me.

427
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,449
CLETUS: Aw,
I wish it had've been.

428

(SOBS)

429
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,362
Now that Brandine's famous,
she done run off
with James Caan.

430
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,003
But don't you worry.
I'm gonna fix his wagon.

431
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,524
A tollbooth?
I hate these things.

432
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,850
That's it. Next time I fly.
