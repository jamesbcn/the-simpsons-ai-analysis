1
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,586
<i>Another Springfield day</i>

2
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,223
<i>A truly perfect place to see
your dreams just fade away</i>

3
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:26,060
<i>Working at the plant's fried
everything inside my pants</i>

4
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:30,331
<i>Good-bye to all romance</i>

5
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:34,668
<i>All I've got to show
for 20 years or so is you</i>

6
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:37,271
- Carl!
- Prescription pain pills!

7
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:39,240
<i>I have a law degree</i>

8
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:41,209
<i>For years I've smelled
just like cat pee</i>

9
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:42,876
<i>This town
just drags you down</i>

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,745
<i>She's completely
lost her head</i>

11
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,914
<i>And we will eat her
when she's dead</i>

12
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:49,417
<i>It really shouldn't be
too long</i>

13
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,886
- <i>Cats! Cats! Cats!</i>
- <i>She'll be our dinner</i>

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,755
<i>This truly is an awful town</i>

15
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,724
<i>The water's green,
the sky is brown</i>

16
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:58,526
<i>Pope Francis came,
he turned around</i>

17
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,561
<i>Our strongest bridge
just holds ten pounds</i>

18
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,230
<i>We're poisoned
by a greedy clown</i>

19
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:04,598
<i>Kang-a-roo meat!</i>

20
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:08,136
<i>Traffic suffers
from paralysis</i>

21
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:11,972
Please.
I'm late for my dialysis.

22
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,974
<i>It's another
Springfield day</i>

23
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,745
<i>I'm too sad to say ol√©</i>

24
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:21,815
<i>We've lost our coolest gays</i>

25
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:25,886
Duffman thinks
this town's okay!

26
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,991
<i>It's another
Springfield day!</i>

27
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:35,996
Lenny's a survivor!

28
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,998
<i>This will be a perfect day</i>

29
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,168
<i>No way
to go outside and play</i>

30
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:41,735
<i>And so we're on our way</i>

31
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,172
<i>To a very nerdy
science conference</i>

32
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,177
Take it Bart!

33
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,744
If you're givin' it,
I don't want it.

34
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,413
Bring it home, boy.

35
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,949
<i>My sister sucks!</i>

36
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:01,789
<i>It's another perfect day!</i>

37
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,324
I brought my stems.

38
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:04,825
Sir, this is a conference

39
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:08,462
of Science, Technology,
Engineering and Math.

40
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:10,130
What about this one?

41
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,533
Dialogue on Pediatric Education.

42
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:18,539
I find this claim highly doyvik.

43
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:21,542
It's all true according
to the highly-prestigious

44
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,444
Institute for Purchased Science.

45
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,313
Here's our top scientist now.

46
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:27,781
Sir, I don't think
this is fooling anyone.

47
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,150
Quiet! And put on the monocle,
Professor Noodle-Strudel.

48
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:35,155
- So where's your booth?
- I don't have one.

49
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:37,858
- I just came here for fun.
- Fun?!

50
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,793
One child, please.

51
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,161
I was here first.

52
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:43,997
If disco's dead,
I don't want to live.

53
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,234
It's Stuicide!

54
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:48,736
Self-unrolling yoga mats.

55
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:54,375
Artificial intelligence
that writes TV recaps.

56
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:58,512
Stranger Things suffers
from season two fatigue.

57
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:01,649
And look! IMAX Al Gore!

58
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:05,519
If every family could just
reduce their carbon footprint

59
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:07,655
by ten percent...

60
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,323
Oh, it's hopeless.

61
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:10,991
The floods are comin', people!

62
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,227
This is my Woodstock!

63
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,665
You okay, honey?

64
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,099
It's fine. It's fine.

65
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,335
I'm just intellectually drunk.

66
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:23,871
I guess that's okay.

67
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,039
Marge, Marge, Marge,
you lighten up.

68
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:27,408
It's science.

69
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,876
Maybe you should sit down.

70
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:31,712
I ain't sittin'.
I'm ready to fly!

71
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,721
Hey, kid,
I want to show you something.

72
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,290
Are you a pervert?

73
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:43,924
No. A chemical engineer.

74
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,026
No!

75
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,528
I used to be like you.

76
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,463
You mean incredibly bored?

77
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:51,865
Oh, let's see
if you think this is boring.

78
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,602
I drop a little water
on powdered sodium...

79
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:59,072
Listen, I don't know
what you're teaching,

80
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,974
but you and I have
great chemistry.

81
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,476
Except for the lab coat.

82
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,645
It makes you look
kind of heavy.

83
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,715
I actually am kind of heavy,
and it makes me look thinner!

84
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:11,084
I don't know what could make
this day more perfect.

85
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,462
You didn't applaud.
Nothing.

86
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,497
Here, I'll show ya how it goes.

87
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:28,001
Thank you.
No selfies.

88
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:30,170
In a lesser musician,
that boy's attitude

89
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,606
would be needy
masquerading as arrogance.

90
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,442
I'm leaving if he can't sing.

91
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:37,110
<i>I've had my share
of crazy flings</i>

92
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,580
<i>But they all end up leavin'</i>

93
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:43,617
<i>And leavin',
well, it really stings...</i>

94
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:46,620
Oh, God.
He's one small step away

95
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:49,523
from destroying
all my logic and reason.

96
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,763
Hey, Lisa.

97
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:59,633
I brought you three waters,
cold, lukewarm and warm.

98
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:02,636
- That's nice. Any sparkling?
- Damn it!

99
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:08,175
Hi. I'm Lisa Simpson,
and I'm nervous

100
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,644
about saying anything that will
ruin this perfect moment.

101
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:12,312
My name's Brendan.

102
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,648
Oh, good, good.
No last names.

103
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,984
Don't want things
moving too fast.

104
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,787
I hope our children
get his hair.

105
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,055
Now to subtly find out
how old he is.

106
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,791
How old are you?

107
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,494
Well, I'm 11, but I'm insouciant
at a 12th grade level,

108
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:27,895
and I'm talented too.

109
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,563
So unfair, right?

110
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:33,066
That's amazing, because
the boys I know are re...

111
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,568
I've got sparkling!

112
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:36,236
Sorry, I'm not thirsty anymore.

113
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,971
Damn it!

114
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,708
So where do you go
to school?

115
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,543
I just moved here.
I'm starting next week

116
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,077
at a school called
Springfield Elementary.

117
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,246
I see it got a few
dreadful reviews on Yelp.

118
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,482
This guy called Gary Chalmers
gave it half a star.

119
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:49,883
Bloody hell!

120
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:52,520
Of all the K through sixes
in this world,

121
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,522
you had to walk into mine.

122
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:58,225
A beautiful hotel bar!
Just like in The Shining!

123
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,661
Oh, hi, lee... tle girl.

124
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,597
If you see your ma...
ma wife,

125
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:07,435
tell her Homer, not your dad,
wants the credit card.

126
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:09,403
I will, sir.

127
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:11,905
- Sir? I'm your dad.
- D'oh!

128
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,340
Today, we are performing

129
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,743
an experiment that
we humorously call

130
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:18,278
making elephant toothpaste.

131
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,281
Boy, the Germans
sure know their humor.

132
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,551
Let's just hope they know
something about chemistry.

133
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:28,355
First, add a tablespoon of
dish soap to hydrogen peroxide,

134
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,258
then add the warm water
and the yeast!

135
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,865
German chemistry!

136
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:51,479
Sounds great, Lisa.
Really great.

137
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,313
You're just a little
behind the beat.

138
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,149
Maybe you're a little
ahead?

139
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:59,319
You're so cute
when you're wrong.

140
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,589
- Channel that rage!
- No!

141
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,423
Make that reed pay
for my sins!

142
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,995
Yeah!

143
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,464
Knock off that racket!

144
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:12,232
It's not a racket!

145
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,735
It's the truest
American art form!

146
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,971
Banging on the walls is
the truest American art form,

147
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:19,573
and I'm a Picasso!

148
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:24,344
Oh, no! They're playing in time
to the beat of my banging!

149
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,914
Well, then stop banging.

150
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,316
I can't.
The rhythm is infectious.

151
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,194
Here's the school trophy case.

152
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,363
If you look closely, it's empty.

153
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,833
They're actually decals
on the glass.

154
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,370
Oh, hello, Lisa.

155
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,005
I see you have a new friend.

156
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,207
Brendan, this is Nelson.

157
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:56,544
Lisa, you sure know
a lot of weird guys.

158
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:58,045
Hello, Brenda.

159
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,548
Excuse me.
Why is being a girl an insult?

160
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:02,650
So evolved!

161
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,385
Lisa, are you squishy
for this ding-dong?

162
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:08,221
Lisa, does that fat kid
like you?

163
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:12,693
Whatever we had,
it's in the past.

164
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,566
I think there's something
in the water in this town.

165
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,375
Oh, man.

166
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,210
<i>On a playground I tripped</i>

167
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,147
<i>Then I saw you and flipped</i>

168
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,216
He used flipped
with a double meaning!

169
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,818
Bastard!

170
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,053
<i>Now I'm skippin'</i>

171
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:43,056
<i>And trippin' for you</i>

172
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,392
He turned his suffering
into entertainment,

173
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:46,994
just like the Jewish people!

174
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,396
Nothing can ruin this moment.

175
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,364
Make way.
Dead gophers.

176
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:52,900
Nothing!

177
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,871
How can you be sleeping?!

178
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:02,743
Oh, thank God.

179
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:07,180
Meanwhile, Bart's teacher says
he has a flair for chemistry.

180
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,682
Why that little...

181
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:11,184
Wait. Flair?
Isn't that a good thing?

182
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,053
Yes. It's too good.

183
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,528
Why don't you ask him
what he's up to?

184
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,098
Because if he lies to me,
it's like a dagger in my heart.

185
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:28,468
What happens when,
I mean, if I ever lie to you?

186
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,771
Can you find out
what he's really up to?

187
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,906
- I will.
- See? That's a lie right there.

188
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,242
D'oh! Okay, I really will.

189
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,210
- That's also a lie.
- D'oh!

190
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,647
Fine.
I really, really, really will.

191
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,749
Finally, the truth.

192
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,252
Keeping promise.

193
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,588
Stupid tree house.

194
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:50,991
So far off the ground.

195
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,895
Dad, you haven't even
started to climb yet.

196
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,064
I have to visualize it first.

197
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,268
Thanks, guys.

198
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,670
No problem.

199
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,271
Why did we do that, Chief?

200
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:06,173
Fat man courtesy, Lou.

201
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:07,941
Fat man courtesy.

202
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:10,410
Son, how do I put this?

203
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,780
Are you breaking bad up here?

204
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:14,281
No, I'm not.

205
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,516
And if you're looking for meth,
go see Cletus.

206
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,686
What?!

207
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:23,957
Meth Life, proud sponsor
of the 2020 Opioid Olympics!

208
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,428
Ooh, that's street ready!

209
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,864
Dad, I'm just trying
to follow in your footsteps.

210
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:33,701
You work in science,
and I think that's really cool.

211
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:36,169
Wow, you've never
said that to me before.

212
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:38,371
Do you want to go to work
with me today?

213
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:39,973
You can help me
research my theory

214
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,975
that the chairs can go flat.

215
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:45,946
I'd like to, but I've got to do
some colloidal titration.

216
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:50,017
Marge, it's worse
than we thought.

217
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,351
He's speaking in tongues.

218
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,853
He's a religious weirdo.

219
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,187
The worst thing there is.

220
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:55,956
Cover your eyes, boys.

221
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,492
I'm about to flip Mr. Simpson
the Flanders finger.

222
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,394
You mean...

223
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:04,798
Yup, a thumbs-up
without a friendly wink.

224
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,537
You have a credit card?

225
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,139
Yeah, but no money.

226
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,742
Oh, a true jazz musician.

227
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,497
Just give the ice cream back.

228
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,067
No way. It was
really hard to scoop.

229
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,438
Prepare to have
your ears belted.

230
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:51,378
<i>My funny valentine</i>

231
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,882
<i>Sweet, comic valentine</i>

232
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:55,883
Nelson?

233
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,685
<i>You make me smile</i>

234
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,588
<i>With my heart</i>

235
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,692
Stop! Why are you doing this?

236
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,361
I don't know. There's no
good word for what I feel.

237
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,531
Scared and excited
at the same time.

238
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,533
There is a word, vulnerable.

239
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,602
Vulnerable?

240
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,406
Yup.
I always liked you,

241
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:22,309
but now I'm seeing you
in a new light.

242
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,316
<i>Your looks are laughable</i>

243
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:33,620
<i>Unphotographable</i>

244
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:36,790
<i>But you're my favorite</i>

245
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:38,892
<i>Work of art</i>

246
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:39,893
<i>Art</i>

247
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:40,961
<i>Art</i>

248
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,095
<i>Art</i>

249
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,663
Nailed it.

250
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:51,071
And so now
there's a jazz war over me.

251
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,740
It's pretty bad.
But it's pretty great.

252
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,344
Scotland once had two queens
fightin' over her.

253
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,112
Loser got Scotland.

254
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,014
Of course, Brendan
is the superior artist.

255
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:02,649
But that kind of intimidates me.

256
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,351
And Nelson's rough,
but he's sweet.

257
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:05,853
Plus he thinks I have dimples.

258
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:08,155
Dimples?
It's that serious?

259
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:10,690
- Aye.
- Let me give ye advice on love.

260
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,660
The Scottish national flower
is the thistle.

261
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,662
A humble weed.
Legend has it

262
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,464
that the Norse King Haakon

263
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,833
staged a surprise invasion.

264
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:23,003
But his barefooted army
stepped on thistles,

265
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:26,039
and their screams
awakened the sleepy Scots.

266
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:31,879
Many a Norwegian lass
lamented their dead lover

267
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,214
- on that glorious day.
- Willie,

268
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:37,050
someone spiked the teachers'
vodka with sulfuric acid.

269
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:39,386
Superintendent Chalmers
lost the tip of his tongue.

270
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,988
Kinner!

271
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,325
Lisa, this is a song about you.

272
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,627
A kid who's almost there.

273
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,629
And when you get there,
you'll blow the roof off.

274
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:59,072
Yeah, well,
I brought my washboard.

275
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:04,844
Nelson.
You took our washboard.

276
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:08,548
I got thongs to scrub.

277
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:10,850
I really can't believe

278
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,152
that this is a choice.

279
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,386
I mean, look at me.

280
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,754
And look at him.

281
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,789
And then look back at me.

282
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,993
Hmm, they're quiet.

283
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,728
Too quiet.

284
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:25,065
Now they're loud.

285
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,366
Too loud.

286
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,736
Now they're just right.

287
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,371
Too just right.

288
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,506
Are you sure
Bart's not planning anything?

289
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,508
A boy takes his cues
from his mother.

290
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,078
If I trust him,
then he'll be good.

291
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,380
Hey, don't knock
my mother's method...

292
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,515
complete abandonment
from age five.

293
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,421
The school talent show.

294
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,924
And on the back,
chemical equations.

295
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,459
Still think he's innocent?

296
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,827
We'll just have to go there
and see.

297
00:14:57,464 --> 00:15:00,433
You wanted rock candy,
you got rock candy.

298
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,971
Brendan and Nelson are fighting.

299
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:07,640
I'm getting Daddy's gun
to under-arrest them.

300
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:08,641
Oh, no.

301
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,877
I'm gonna call you decrescendo,

302
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,946
'cause you're goin' down.

303
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,547
Nelson, that's clever.

304
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,650
Thanks. For you, I read a book.

305
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,720
All right, Ralphie,
easy, easy.

306
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,755
Give Daddy back his hat.

307
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:27,594
Oh, you missed everything,
just like Daddy.

308
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,067
So many clams.

309
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:37,837
Well, you're gonna look
very nice for the show tonight.

310
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,240
It doesn't matter how I look,
I'm not ready.

311
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,775
I've been so distracted
by those boys.

312
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,344
How did you choose Dad?

313
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,912
And never regret it?

314
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,847
Marge, I might've swallowed

315
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,882
a couple of your earrings.

316
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,553
Gotta go.

317
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,526
I do not want to know
how you got these back.

318
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,461
So, we're really doing it.

319
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,496
We're going to a talent show

320
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,799
where Bart is putting on
a chemistry demonstration.

321
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,168
Have I got that right?

322
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,503
If our faces
get melted off today,

323
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:12,772
I want the last thing Bart sees

324
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,874
to be us believing in him.

325
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,144
Fine, fine.
Let me just finish my will.

326
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,683
And...

327
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,885
Oh, it's good
to have that taken care of.

328
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:32,959
Nelson? A word?

329
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,394
Take five, Martin.

330
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,063
I'm not even in your act.

331
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:38,498
I said take five.

332
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,702
Nelson, I cherish
our unhealthy relationship.

333
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,405
Especially the fact
that I can tell you the truth.

334
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,507
Kiddo, you're not a singer.

335
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,409
Okay, fine, I won't sing.

336
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,144
But I'll still perform.

337
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:54,347
That's how much I want
to hold your stupid hand.

338
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,884
You're up, Nelson.

339
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:01,854
Hello.

340
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,756
I'm the school bully.

341
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,094
Don't be a dingus.

342
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,695
I'm the next Charlie Mingus.

343
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:11,731
Could I really choose him?

344
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:30,583
My choice is clear. Brendan.

345
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,121
Ooh, yeah,
I feel the groove.

346
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,892
Next contestant,
Brendan Beiderbecke.

347
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,297
And Brendan wins!

348
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:45,732
Not so fast.

349
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,800
We have a disqualification.

350
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:50,870
This young man does not
live in the district.

351
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,440
Right, his home is 50 feet
into West Springfield,

352
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,608
which means he will be
transferred to a school

353
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:59,045
three buses and a long bike ride
away from here.

354
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,913
- Brendan...
- No, Lisa.

355
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,249
I can't put you through that.

356
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:03,983
I guess this
relationship is over

357
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:07,454
until this town
invests in mass transit.

358
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:14,261
I'll never see him again.

359
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:17,063
Lisa, I'm glad
you didn't choose me.

360
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,132
No woman is worth
learning music.

361
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,800
All this time
I've been choosing jazz

362
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,669
over doing my reps.

363
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,971
Well, my reps never let me down.

364
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,006
Lift weights, get dates.

365
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,142
Lift weights, get dates.

366
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:31,844
Well, I guess I'm alone
for the moment.

367
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,680
And I like it.

368
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,448
- Good for Lisa.
- She's better off alone.

369
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:36,983
She doesn't need a man.

370
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,785
Wait a minute, everybody.
Even though

371
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,820
the most interesting and
emotionally compelling part

372
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,822
is over, we still
have one performer

373
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,625
who says he will
blow you away.

374
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:49,095
So please welcome the original
Dennis the Chemist,

375
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,663
Bart Simpson.

376
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:59,806
Drop the beaker, Screwy Pasteur.

377
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,943
No.
I wasn't doing anything bad.

378
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,512
Pour the beaker and you'll see.

379
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:08,348
We are not gonna let you
mix those chemicals.

380
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:10,350
We got a tip
from an anonymous source

381
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,219
named Seymour Skinner.

382
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,721
Do you even know
what anonymous means?

383
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,489
Helpful?

384
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,125
Mom, I'm innocent.

385
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,727
You believe me, don't you?

386
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,230
Oh, if he's lying,
I'll never forgive him.

387
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,898
If he's telling the truth,
he'll never forgive me.

388
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:29,236
Glad I'm not you.

389
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:32,405
Bart, sweetie,
I'll pour the beaker for you.

390
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,561
He's innocent. But then
who put the sulfuric acid

391
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:56,062
in Superintendent Chalmers'
drink?

392
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,597
I did.

393
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,099
- Willie! Why?
- Why?

394
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:03,236
Because, Seymour,
I was trying to kill you.

395
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,572
Well, that's okay. Good man.

396
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,106
- But...
- Quiet, Seymour.

397
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,775
The man's got a dream.

398
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:13,413
I never doubted you.

399
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:14,981
Well, you should have.

400
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:33,065
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

401
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,201
This episode was supposed
to have been a parody

402
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,204
of Moonlight,
not La La Land.

403
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,573
Moonlight?
But none of us have seen it.

404
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,142
We have the DVD.
We could watch it tonight.

405
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,478
Either that
or X-Men Apocalypse.

406
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:46,979
X-Men!

407
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:49,015
I'd like to see Moonlight.
