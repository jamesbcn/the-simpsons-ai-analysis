{\an8}What the... ?

54
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,823
{\an8}Okay, sweetie, I got a story
about another little girl

55
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,703
{\an8}who got lost in the woods,
but it wasn't a girl,

56
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,280
{\an8}and it wasn't the woods.

00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,117
{\an8}Suck, suck, indeed.

59
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,042
{\an8}And it all happened
once upon a time,

60
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,290
{\an8}before you were born,

61
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,921
{\an8}and my chances for a man cave

62
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,628
{\an8}went out the window.

{\an8}Bless you all for sacrificing
your Saturday afternoon

65
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:42,177
{\an8}to help us clean up skid row.

66
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,723
{\an8}When God came for Sunday,
I said nothing.

67
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,307
{\an8}Now he comes for Saturday.

68
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,773
{\an8}Homer Simpson, it's one thing
to moan and groan on the bus,

69
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,524
{\an8}but in front of these unfortunates,

70
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,106
{\an8}well, (scoffs)
that just curls my 'stache.

71
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,817
Hey, Flanders,
why don't you take some advice

72
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,704
from your Bible and zip it?

73
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,531
Oh, where does the Bible
say "zip it"?

74
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,576
It's the first thing
the burning bush said to Moses.

75
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,621
Thank you for teaching us Scripture.

76
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,714
Thank you.

77
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,247
You know, all this helping others

78
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,337
is giving me
the most satisfying feeling ever.

79
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,053
So satisfying.

80
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,724
Uh, Lenny...

81
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,353
Oh, huh.

82
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,599
I get why they do it.

83
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,641
Totally get it.

84
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,273
(whimpers)

85
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,480
Hey, Carl, you want to buy
all my stuff for five dollars?

86
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,232
(dog howling in distance)

87
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,824
{\an8}Well, thank you all for spending the day

88
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,990
{\an8}thinking of others
instead of yourselves.

89
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,070
Saturday.
It was a Saturday.

90
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:44,275
Now, a reward
to the most selfless cleaner:

91
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,117
a family vacation
to the Grand Canyon.

92
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,663
The winner: Ned Flanders.

93
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,747
Surprise, surprise.

94
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,503
The guy that did the best job wins.

95
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,915
{\an8}NED: Mm-hmm!

96
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,384
{\an8}But this gift certificate
is for two families.

97
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,934
Hey, Reverend, we'd love it
if you and Helen would join us.

98
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,049
Um... uh... uh...

99
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,010
Mm...

100
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,716
Of course we'd love to join you,

101
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,216
but I've noticed that you and Homer

102
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,228
haven't been
the friendliest "neighboreenos,"

103
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,850
if you get my diddly.

104
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:16,187
Uh, well, Ned, I think
the Lord would want you

105
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,614
to take the Simpsons
on this trip.

106
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,573
Our Lord?

107
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,492
Yes. Our Lord.

108
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,071
For would it not
indeed be glorious,

109
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,827
if in visiting a natural chasm,

110
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:29,158
two quarrelsome neighbors
would bridge the chasm

111
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,655
of their own discord.

112
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,538
Well, I guess if Job
could accept his burdens.

113
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,085
Um, in America,

114
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,549
it's pronounced "job," Flanders.

115
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,009
(laughing) We can settle it
when we're zipped up

116
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,469
together in a sleeping bag.

117
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,679
(groans)

118
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,929
Welcome aboard.

119
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,760
Oh, oh, we'd love to go,

120
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,385
but is it such a good idea
to travel with another family?

121
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,394
It's fun.
We travel with the Hibberts all the time.

122
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,897
We ran into you once,
in Cincinnati.

123
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,149
And we had dinner.

124
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,900
We slid our tables together.

125
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:01,442
We were in a booth
we could not get out of.

126
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,202
(groaning sadly)

127
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,700
Homie, we should go.

128
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,412
You and Ned
need to learn to get along.

129
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,793
You said the same thing
about me and Bart.

130
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,080
No. The judge said the same
thing about you and Bart.

131
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,575
Judges.
If they were any good, they'd be lawyers.

132
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,787
Okay, we'll go.

133
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,087
But if Flanders gets so annoying

134
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,510
that I can't take it anymore,

135
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,628
the code word is "octopus."

136
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,085
Can it be something else?

137
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,675
I don't like things
with hidden beaks.

138
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,181
Octopus or nothing.

139
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,853
Okay.

140
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,642
So we took eight-year-old Bart,

141
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,885
and six-year-old Lisa.

142
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,597
After ten hours of driving,

143
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,687
I finally saw
the most glorious site.

144
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,404
(engine revs, tires screech)

145
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,278

146
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:48,662

Ahhh...

149
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,245
(growls)

150
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,753
Ah, ah, ah...

151
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:04,005
Ah... oh... oh, oh, yeah.

152
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,300
Ah... ah... yeah.

153
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,046
(hums)

154
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,808
(loud swallowing)

155
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,309
(whimpering)

156
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,562
Ah.

157
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,483
MARGE:
Oh.

158
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,232
It's like Disneyland for thin people.

159
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:23,154
{\an8}Did you know that the Grand Canyon
was created by erosion?

160
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,744
{\an8}And before 1871,
it was called Big Canyon?

161
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,990
{\an8}Okay, that's it.

162
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,201
{\an8}We're on vacation.

163
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,411
{\an8}-(crying)
-Why, you little...

164
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,661
(rattling)

165
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:33,913
(both grunting)

166
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,133
(both laughing)

167
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,456
Whoa.

168
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,296
Keep 'em coming, boy.

169
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,552
Oh, ooh.

170
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,183
That one stung me.
(laughing)

171
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,430
Ow.

172
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,431
That's enough.

173
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,142
HOMER AND BART:
Aw.

174
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,272
{\an8}We're here to enjoy ourselves.

175
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,439
{\an8}If you just turn your head slightly,

176
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,978
{\an8}I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised.

177
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,652
{\an8}-No time.
-Homer.

178

{\an8}(Grofé's "Sunrise" from
<i>The Grand Canyon Suite</i> playing)

179
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,815
{\an8}HOMER:

00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,313
I'm not living in your carcass.

362
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,564
Oh, come on.

363
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,606
You make it sound
like a bad thing.

364
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:41,979
Look, we're saved!

365
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,896
We just go down there,
get some food and help

366
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,904
returning to civilization.

367
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,026

(animals screeching)

372
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,221
How is that even camping?

373
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,628
'Tis easier for a camel

374
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,796
to pass through
the eye of a needle

375
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,215
than a rich man
to get into heaven.

376
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,014
(sighs)
Sometimes I just don't get it.

377
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,098
What I'm saying is,
the eye of the needle

378
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,943
is very small, and a camel...

379
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,268
No. I mean down there.

380
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,853
They have everything
we need to survive,

381
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,148
but they won't share.

382
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,271
Maybe if I look through
these binoculars one more time,

383
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,988
I'll-I'll see something better.

384
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,568
(gasps)

385
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,986
We've got to go in
and steal what we need.

386
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,985
Well, thou shalt not steal.

387
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,537
But if I don't steal, that's coveting.

388
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,870
That's bad, too.

389
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,865
Look, Flanders,
we tried things your way,

390
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,167
and it failed.

391
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,460
Now let's try mine.

392
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,753
Okay.

393
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,206
W-Wait!

394
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,955
We never did things my way.

395
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,337
Too late. (voice fading)
I'm already rolling downhill.

396
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,336
Ow, sharp rock.

397
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,928
Ooh, cactus!

398
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,313
(screams)
More scorpions.

399
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,269
Is that all you can do? Sting?

400
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,309

Easy, Flanders, don't make a sound.

will last forever,

we enter our cars?

in the end,
it's up to our wives.
