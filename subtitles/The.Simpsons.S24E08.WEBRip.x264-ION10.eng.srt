00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,692
He knows I love him, and he loves me.

176
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,191
(growling)

177
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,863
That's short for "Rrright you are."

178
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,572
I don't think you even like
Santa's Little Helper.

179
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:29,033
You never take him for walks
or sleep with him in your arms.

180
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,445
And I suspect you've been
chewing on his treats.

181
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,455
How are they his treats
if I paid for them?

182
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,868
Okay, okay.
I'll be nicer to the dude.

183
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,037
I've just never really
been a dog person.

184
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,706
Really?
What about Bongo?

185
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,594
Bongo?!

186
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,091
I told you never to ever talk about Bongo.

187
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,634
(sobbing)

188
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,804
Ever!

189
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,808
What just happened? Who's Bongo?

190
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,890
Bongo was Homer's dog when he was a boy.

191
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,556
HOMER: He's still my dog!

192
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,814
We got him years ago.

193
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,607
HOMER: I don't know what you
just said, but it's wrong!

194
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,900
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

195
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,823
(sighs) I was working long hours

196
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,073
at the Springfield Smokestack Factory.

197
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,831
<i>Oh, I was so tired when I got home.</i>

198
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,331
<i>Then little Homer</i>
<i>would start crying and crying,</i>

199
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,464
<i>but Bongo knew just what to do.</i>

200
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,422
-(howling)
-(crying stops)

201
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,764
(snoring)

202
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,508
Now, my dear, we can
watch <i>Mannix</i> as a couple.

203
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,852
Unfortunately, like all true stories,

204
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,519
this one has a crappy ending.

205
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,598
You have a story with an ending?

206
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,563
Uh-huh. All my stories have endings now.

207
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,305
They're putting something
in my Jell-O down at the home.

208
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,897
Anyway, Homer and that dog

209
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:49,493
went together like Christmas
and suicidal thoughts.

225
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,656
when Mr. Burns was lobbying

226
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,786

Now.

238
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,989
Mr. Burns, I'm awfully sorry.

239
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,701
Oh, I'll be all right.

240
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,081

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,510
So, Lady Godiva gets a haircut,

right, and... kids?!

Homer had no idea.

00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,326
He was so innocent and chubby.

261
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,495
Course now, he's just stupid and fat.

00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,424
-Focus.
-Huh? Oh, right.

263
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,003

Oh, no, you can't 'cause, um, that's
my dream. I'm gonna be chief of police.

301
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,671
Well, then I'll be a spokesman

But I want to know about Dad

306
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,848
Your father lost a lot in his life--

307
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,516
his hair, his mother,

308
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,515
more games of Monopoly
than any man ought.

309
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,988
He'd go to jail and stay there
'cause he loves the easy life,

310
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,700
but I think losing that dog

311
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,491

349
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,787

00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,300
I got a bug zapper,
and I ain't afraid to use it.

353
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,511
Is that sugar water I smell?

354
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,972
-(electrical zapping)
-(groans)

355
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,971
Well, I'm afraid I already told my dogs

356
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,644
they could tear yours apart.

357
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,143
Don't make me look into those
pitiless black eyes and say,

358
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,555
"Daddy didn't bring you
a friend-friend to rip-rip!"

359
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,855
Where's Bongo?

360
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,358
Is he still at the crazy lady's...

361
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,770
Back to sleep, son.

362
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:01,898
(chuckles)

363
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,775
(groans, snores)

364
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,453
Oh, listen,

365
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,491
I can think of something you'd enjoy

366
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,285
more than killing a dog.

367
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,788
Dropping a horse on a church?

368
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,660
No! Breaking a man's spirit.

369
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,038
Mine.

370
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,964
Well, I guess I could always

371
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,923
drop a horse on a church afterward.

372
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,093
Fine.

373
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,341
<i>I had to take care</i>
<i>of his hounds for a year.</i>

374
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,837
<i>I tried to wear a bite-proof suit,</i>

375
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,718
<i>but those satanic Snoopys</i>
<i>always found their way in.</i>

376
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:33,926
(growling)

377
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,016
(groaning)

378
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,902
I'm not done with you.

379
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,070
I insist you never wear shoes
or a proper necktie again.

380
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,441
Just house slippers

381
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,067
and the most humiliating tie there is:

382
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,735
bolo.

383
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,833
(gasps)

384
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,829
<i>But the hardest part</i>

385
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,831
<i>was that my son was so angry with me.</i>

386
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,624
How was school today?

387
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,877
Ketchup, please.

388
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,879
You're probably wondering
how I got rabies.

389
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,172
-Well...
-I'm not hungry anymore.

390
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,634
<i>Our relationship never recovered,</i>

391
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:10,175
<i>and no amount of ignoring</i>
<i>the problem could ever fix it.</i>

392
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,640
(sobbing)

393
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,850
Grampa, why is the
saddest story you ever told

394
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,062
the only one
that's ever made sense?

395
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,272
(scoffs)
Doesn't make sense to me.

396
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:23,113
I happen to remember it
just a little differently.

397
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,860
Well, tell us your version.

398
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:28,902
Now granted, I was just a kid,
but I say...

399
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,488
<i>Grampa always hated Bongo</i>

400
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,373
<i>and loved money so he sold Bongo</i>

401
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,450
<i>to a wicked farm witch</i>
<i>just so he could hang out</i>

402
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,207
<i>with a bunch of rich dogs,</i>
<i>and kidnapped Santa</i>

403
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:42,289
<i>so I'd never get the toy</i>
<i>I actually wanted.</i>

404
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,916
And then... then wha...

405
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,594
and then what happened... was...

406
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,972
(stammers)

407
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,719
Gee, my story
doesn't make much sense,

408
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,302
except the Santa part.

409
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,967
Yeah, but at least it was short.

410
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,885
Wait. Wait.

411
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,944
There's one part of the story
even Grampa didn't know about.

412
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,059
A few months later,
I went to rescue Bongo.

413
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,275
(coughing)

414
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,283
Hendrix, come here, boy.

415
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,196
(barking)

416
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,195
<i>But there was one thing</i>
<i>I wasn't prepared for.</i>

417
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,538
<i>Bongo was...</i>

418
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,292
<i>happy without me.</i>

419
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,745
<i>He had become her dog.</i>

420
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,797
Oh, Homie.

421
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,301
I'm so sorry.

422
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,382
Well, that's just the way dogs are.

423
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,428
The most disloyal, unfaithful
creatures God ever made.

424
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,522
Homer, maybe you should take
a look at this.

425
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,189
A Christmas card I got
from Miss Viola years later.

426
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,859
HOMER: He still had my sweatshirt.

427
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,150
Bongo didn't forget you.

428
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,324
Unlike those gerbils
of yours we gave away.

429
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,823
Oh, they were fickle as hell.

430
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,526
Oh, my God, Dad.

431
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,946
I owe you an apology.

432
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,035
You <i>saved </i>Bongo.

433
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,871
I never understood that till now.

434
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,627
(sobbing)
All these years I thought

435
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,709
you loved that dog more than me.

436
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:12,546
(sobbing)
Why would you think that?

437
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:16,803
Just because I put you in a home
where they feed you dog food?

438
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,807
Aw, give me a hug, son.

439
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,730
Okay, but I'm a little out of practice.

440
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,230
Hold your arms like you're
carrying a wedding cake.

441
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,233
-What flavor?
-It doesn't matter.

442
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,645
If it doesn't matter,
then I call Snickers.

443
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,654
-That's not a flavor.
-Everything's a flavor

444
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,067
in the kitchens of today.

445
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,695
Just hug already.

446
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,792
Homie? Huh?

447
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,541
(snoring)

448
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,464
Come on, boy, time to go to bed.

449
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,293
My dog.

450
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,008
All right, Homer, it's your moment.

451
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,379
But he's mine tomorrow.

452
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,175
(both snoring)

453
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,889
<i>♪ Me and my Arrow ♪</i>

454
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,225
<i>♪ Straighter than narrow ♪</i>

455
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,899
<i>♪ Wherever we go ♪</i>

456
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,150
<i>♪ Everyone knows it's me and my Arrow ♪</i>

457
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,196
More tea, sir?

458
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,244
No. Any word from Karl Rove?

459
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,037
Sir, despite what he's been
telling you, it's over.

460
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,711
-Romney lost.
-Damn it.

461
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,129
I guess it's time I explain
to these good people

462
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,459
the upcoming fiscal cliff.

463
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,796
Think of the economy as a car
and the rich man as the driver.

464
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,255
If you don't give the driver
all the money,

465
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,465
he'll drive you over a cliff.

466
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,465
It's just common sense.

467
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,098
Furthermore, rich people feel things

468
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,055
more deeply than the common man.

469
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:51,395
{\an8}(screaming, sobbing)

470
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,941
And we've got to change our
approach to immigration.

471
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,776
I have a progressive proposal
to let into this country

472
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,242
200 grimy Irishmen a year.

473
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,453
I've got lots of potatoes
that need peeling

474
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,293
and stables to be mucked out.

475
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,948
Sir, the insta-polls are in.

476
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,657
You're just digging yourself deeper.

477
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,037
Well, then let me just say this.

478
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,793
Marco Rubio... (speaking Spanish)

479
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,916
I'm afraid you
just made things even worse.

480
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,133
How? Why?

481
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,263
You just said Marco Rubio
is a pink handkerchief.

482
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,880
This public service announcement is over.

483
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,177

484
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,050
