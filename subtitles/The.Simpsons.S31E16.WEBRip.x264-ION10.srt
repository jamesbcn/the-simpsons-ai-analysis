1
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:44,912
And that's why, if you go
to that little town in France,

2
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,781
there's a statue of me
surrendering.

3
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,983
See?

4
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,387
Wow, Grampa, your stories
are really cool today.

5
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,657
Yeah, the nursing home finally
stopped using me as the placebo

6
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,726
and gave me real meds.

7
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:07,067
But what I really wanted to do
today was to give you this,

8
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,736
my most precious possession.

9
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:12,239
Open it.

10
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,148
It'll explode in just five
seconds if you pull the pin.

11
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,016
Senior moment!

12
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,518
Put it back! Put it back!

13
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,154
It don't work that way!
It's like having a kid!

14
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:31,325
- Say your prayers, boy.
- Never!

15
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,863
I pranked ya.

16
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,534
Grampa, that was hilarious.

17
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,902
I understand if the answer's no,

18
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,571
but can I borrow
your dud grenade?

19
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,208
He's asleep.

20
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,277
That means yes.

21
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,787
This year, we've just been named
the most sedentary school in the state.

22
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,725
No. No, no.
Sedentary is a bad thing.

23
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,294
Our vocabulary score
was also abysmal.

24
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:09,196
- Is that a bad...
- It's a bad thing, yes.

25
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,564
Now to get you kids

26
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,232
up on your feet,
we decided to have

27
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,002
a two-hour-long sit-down
assembly instead of recess.

28
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,370
No fair!

29
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,139
- Sit down.
- Yes, ma'am.

30
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:21,341
To kick things off,
please welcome the new mascot

31
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:25,045
from the town's semi-amateur
hockey team, Vinnie the Vulture.

32
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,216
Hey, kids.

33
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:32,219
Milhouse, you didn't tell me
your dad got another bad job.

34
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,554
Actually, he's the understudy.

35
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,723
The main guy got shingles.

36
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,093
There's a bee in my beak!

37
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,928
Okay, taking a break.

38
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,531
How many... How many stingers
can one be have?!

39
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,133
God!

40
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,801
How about a little
show-and-tell?

41
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,636
I'll go first!

42
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,872
Don't worry.

43
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:54,074
It is a live grenade,
but it won't go off

44
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,710
as long as you don't
pull the pin out.

45
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,211
Ay, caramba!

46
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,452
Climb in my ass hatch, son.

47
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,566
It was all just a joke.

48
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,568
You monster.
You had me finally believing

49
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,771
the school would be destroyed,
and you took it away.

50
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:27,708
I didn't think
it was funny either, Bart.

51
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:31,745
You have no idea
how far up in there I went.

52
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,819
Mom, you heard there was
an emergency and you came?

53
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,121
Oh, well, actually,
I was just having a sleepover

54
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:43,223
with your uncle...
moustache over there.

55
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,326
Mom,

56
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:49,096
you promised you'd never show up
at school drunk again.

57
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,466
I'm not gonna lie,
I am in a shame spiral,

58
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,168
hanging out
with lowlifes and bums.

59
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,470
Hey, Gary.

60
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,972
This is to not say my name.

61
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,640
Payday!

62
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:04,044
Nelson, I'm gonna go take
a nap in your locker.

63
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:05,479
Freedom!

64
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,419
Son, you forced this man
to jump on the grenade

65
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,154
seconds before I was going to.

66
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,655
Well, Simpson, thanks to you,

67
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,958
now no one can
bring grenades to school.

68
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,695
This time, you will be expelled,
never to return.

69
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,597
Please don't expel him.

70
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,932
He's got nowhere to go.

71
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,468
Bart Simpson,
I hereby declare you...

72
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,304
Wait. I've lived next
to this boy for years.

73
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,373
There's good in him. Let me
work with him after school.

74
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,142
I'll improve him
with the three P's.

75
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,878
Persistence, prayer
and persistent prayer.

76
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,646
Oh, God, you're one of those.

77
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,249
- Dear Lord...
- Don't kneel. Don't kneel!

78
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,751
We're in a public school,
for God's sake!

79
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,988
Engel v. Vitale, 1962.

80
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,990
The Supreme Court
asserts that...

81
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,926
Superintendent, you are about
to be on the business end

82
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,561
of a prayer chain.

83
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,997
As a part of
a religious program carried on

84
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,698
by government,
it is a matter of history...

85
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,968
My love of prayer is reflected
in my chest hair.

86
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:05,372
I appear to be
in the wrong group chat.

87
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,774
And the judgment of the
Court of Appeals of New York

88
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,676
is reversed,
and the cause of...

89
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:10,844
Amen.

90
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:13,446
Sir, we're up
to 205 verified pray-ers.

91
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,149
Do you really want me
to give them your office number?

92
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,255
Fine. Stop, please!
I've had enough.

93
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,690
We won't expel Bart.

94
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,425
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

95
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:29,062
If you supervise this boy,
keeping him away

96
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,731
from the baleful presence
of his father.

97
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,433
Woo-hoo! Win-win!

98
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,203
Bon après-midi, Bart.

99
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,438
While you get some special help,

100
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,273
I'm hanging
with the French club.

101
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,209
Well, just don't make fun of me
in French.

102
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,910
Vous êtes un imbécile.

103
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:46,913
Profitez de votre journée
avec le Flanders!

104
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,148
A demain.

105
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,317
Nous allons faire
un pique-nique.

106
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,986
Shut up. Shut up!

107
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,821
Vous ne parlez pas français?

108
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,362
Isn't it great, son?

109
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:05,031
Washing dishes can be both
a chore and a meditation.

110
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,000
I do feel kind of at peace.

111
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,335
Cut myself.

112
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,070
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

113
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,239
Gotcha!

114
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:17,377
I can make that real blood,
you little punk.

115
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,012
What did you say?

116
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,614
What I meant to say was,

117
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,250
oodily-doodily,
we'll change that atti-toodily.

118
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,251
Fishing?

119
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,585
When I didn't take a Ritalin?

120
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,254
- You monster.
- Hush.

121
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,423
If you don't catch something,
we don't eat tonight.

122
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,758
Stupid fishing.

123
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,594
Stupid peace and quiet.

124
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,263
Stupid sunset.

125
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,597
Thinks it has so many colors.

126
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:40,600
So beautiful and bright
and golden and...

127
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,236
Mind your line, Bart.
You got a nibble.

128
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,071
I've got it!
I've got it!

129
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,574
I murdered a fish.
Me, by myself.

130
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:48,909
Don't get cocky, son.

131
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,077
You've still got to clean it
and eat it.

132
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,446
First things first,
we got to start a fire.

133
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,215
With what?

134
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,285
We'll build character
by building it ourselves.

135
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,123
Your turn.

136
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,492
Oh, my hands hurt.

137
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,327
There are child labor laws,
you know.

138
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:09,462
This is the most idiotic...

139
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,899
Ay, caramba!

140
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,603
Ay, caramba...!

141
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,240
- How do you feel?
- Great. But why?

142
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:21,975
Well, it's called
accomplishment, son...

143
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,476
something you've earned yourself

144
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,145
that can never be taken
from you.

145
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,680
Left-handed handshake.

146
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,181
And now that you're on your way,

147
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,383
there's no telling
how far you'll go.

148
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,654
<i>Amazing grace</i>

149
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:39,392
<i>How sweet the sound...</i>

150
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,061
Oh, my goodness.

151
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,064
Our little boy could never sing
like that before.

152
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,300
Well, if you ask me,
he's not doing so well now.

153
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,171
Remarkable.

154
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,373
I thought the only way
to turn Bart into a little angel

155
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,009
was a downed power line
at a water park.

156
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,410
You must be so proud.

157
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,379
You really turned
that boy around.

158
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:00,814
Oh, well...

159
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,315
Congratulations,

160
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,017
Ned Flanders.

161
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,618
Yeah.
Way to go there, Flanders.

162
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,187
You the man, Ned.

163
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,856
Hey, you can't give him
all the credit.

164
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:12,258
We're the ones who messed him up
in the first place.

165
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:24,371
Listen, stupid Flanders,
I just want to say thank you,

166
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,873
and if there's anything
I can do for you...

167
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,375
Well, for starters,
you could stop calling me

168
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,542
stupid Flanders.

169
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,211
Oh, here we go.

170
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:32,245
No, that's it.

171
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,549
Thank you, Flanders.

172
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,784
Was that so hard?

173
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,120
He was laughing
under that mustache.

174
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,457
What are you doing here?

175
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,192
Bart's actually doing
math homework.

176
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,395
I wanted to see it for myself.

177
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,232
Listen, I can help my own kid.

178
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,967
Let's see.

179
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,470
Four and two-thirds
plus five-sixths equals,

180
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,407
carry the math...

181
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,541
And...

182
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,743
Oh, no! The dog ate it!

183
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,782
It's okay, Dad. I finished it.

184
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,450
With Mr. Flanders' help.

185
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:13,553
Well, it looks like I'm useless.

186
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,956
Let me just walk away
with my dignity.

187
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:24,864
<i>Who can I turn to</i>

188
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,601
<i>When nobody needs me?</i>

189
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,670
My son doesn't love me.

190
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,313
You don't get me at all.

191
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:49,622
Hey, kid. I'm sad too.

192
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,427
You shouldn't be out here alone.

193
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:57,097
Oh, nobody cares.

194
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,431
My dad left.

195
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,366
My mom's a drunk.

196
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,870
My house is a trailer,
and all the wheels are flat.

197
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,706
My last solid food
was an ice cube.

198
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,543
My TV is a milk crate
with a squirrel in it.

199
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,479
This kid is such a wreck,

200
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,980
even I could help him.

201
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:17,584
Which I could use
to get back at Bart.

202
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:23,590
I get my hair cut
by hiding in the bushes

203
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,359
when the gardener comes by.

204
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,594
Am I gonna do it?

205
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,432
Is it wrong to take advantage
of one child's feelings

206
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,767
to make another child feel bad?

207
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,103
Nobody has the answer to that.

208
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,239
Here, son. Let me help.

209
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,146
Okay, okay. Enough snot.

210
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,122
Say, listen, kid,
how would you like a mentor?

211
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,790
What's a mentor?

212
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,560
A mentor is
a special kind of teacher.

213
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,262
But you don't know nothing.

214
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,030
Hey, there's lots
I can teach you.

215
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,999
How to steal filling from a pie.

216
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,067
How to get cookies
without giving blood.

217
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,203
How to use spearmint gum
as a deodorant.

218
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,739
And maybe I'll get someone
to fix your teeth.

219
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,674
There's a doctor for your teeth?

220
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,779
Can you teach me
how to do this maze?

221
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,749
Well, it'll be a project
we can work on together.

222
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:23,983
Cool.

223
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,953
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm out of ketchup.

224
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,756
I'll give it back

225
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,091
when I'm done.

226
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,296
Hello, Bart.

227
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,232
Just wanted you to know
I'm going to Nelson's house.

228
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,268
We're close. Super close.

229
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,637
First of all, Dad,
you called me.

230
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,307
And second,
are you mentoring Nelson

231
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,442
just to get back at Bart?

232
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,211
No! No way!

233
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,681
But if you happen to see Bart,
show him these.

234
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,924
Okay, kid,
I'm gonna teach you how to pack

235
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,093
for when your wife
kicks you out of the house.

236
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,429
Are the clothes thrown out
onto the front yard?

237
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,165
Well, let's say you have
enough time to get a suitcase.

238
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,566
What's a suitcase?

239
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,069
All right,
let's move on to something else.

240
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:19,839
Okay, but first I got to ask,
are you sleeping with my mom?!

241
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,441
No.

242
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,676
No one's ever said that!

243
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,648
That's what
we're going for, boys.

244
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:31,451
I can't believe we're gonna be
in the pride parade.

245
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:32,986
Christian pride.

246
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,955
Finally, Christians
can openly show our faith.

247
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:38,224
We're sure! We're pure!

248
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,659
Get used to it!

249
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,527
Hey, Bart.

250
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,796
Look who I taught
how to ride a bike.

251
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,798
Nelson already knew
how to ride a bike.

252
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,901
Yeah, but he didn't know how
to make cool motorcycle noises.

253
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,217
Let me help you
back on your hog.

254
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,954
Me and Nelson are so close,
people are calling us Homeson.

255
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,889
Homeson away!

256
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:14,961
Homeson!

257
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,896
Vroom.

258
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,898
Mom, are you seeing all this?

259
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,900
- Yes.
- Are you gonna do anything?

260
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,002
- No.
- Why not?

261
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,038
This is a complicated one.

262
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,373
Both boys are being helped.

263
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,110
What I'm trying to say is
it's time to change Maggie.

264
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,313
Where are you, my little excuse?

265
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,617
Sorry!

266
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,061
Dad, what exactly
are you teaching Nelson?

267
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,764
Banking.

268
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,199
Aiming for success.

269
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:57,303
And breaking into
the music industry.

270
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,372
Here's $40.

271
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,207
That's a lot of money to me.

272
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:04,911
But I want you to get some
therapy about what you're doing.

273
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,680
40 bucks' worth of therapy
coming up.

274
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:09,615
From a licensed therapist.

275
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,617
Moe has a liquor license.

276
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,220
Yeah, let's not discuss that
too much.

277
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,356
Take the money.
Get some help.

278
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,725
Why are you doing this?

279
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,394
Dad, I have to be
the voice of morality.

280
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,695
No, you don't.

281
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:25,098
Well, I like being
the voice of morality.

282
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:28,901
And I like believing
this role has not typecast me!

283
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,404
I can still do Shakespeare!

284
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:35,108
All that glitters
is not delicious Duff Gold!

285
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,843
To pee or not to pee!

286
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,511
There is no question!

287
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:39,912
Oh, no!

288
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,315
Excuse me. Got to pee.

289
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,452
Doc,

290
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,020
I see it all so clearly now.

291
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:51,457
I'm afraid of success because
my father never had time for me.

292
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:53,259
- Which means...
- Time's up.

293
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:55,428
- But two more minutes...
- It's not a breakthrough.

294
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,264
Now I feel worse
than when I came in.

295
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:00,099
See you next month.

296
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,870
Okay. 40 bucks
gets you ten minutes. Go!

297
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,939
I was mentoring another kid
to make my son jealous,

298
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,741
and something weird happened.

299
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:11,277
I'm actually starting to like
the little dingus.

300
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:12,578
Help me.

301
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,514
I am appalled!

302
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,251
You are ruining two boys' lives
for your own petty ego.

303
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,453
Let me tell you
what a good therapist says.

304
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,956
A good therapist says,
whatever you do is right!

305
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,358
That's only if you're rich.

306
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:30,997
Mentor entering!

307
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,598
Hey, Homer, honey.

308
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,600
Come on,
spend a minute with Mama.

309
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,936
Look, lady,
I'm not interested in...

310
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,604
- What the...?
- I know.

311
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,940
You're just spending time
with my son

312
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:43,676
to make your son jealous.

313
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:47,914
Sooner or later, you're gonna
leave him, like all the rest.

314
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,460
And it'll break his heart.

315
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,428
Hey, I'm not here
to save the world.

316
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:05,698
I'm a mentor.
I come in, I ment, then I go.

317
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,873
Tell that boy the truth.

318
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,982
Son, we need to talk.

319
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,551
No. No.
I know where this goes.

320
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,753
It ends with you giving me
a phone number

321
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,822
that starts with 555.

322
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,090
No! Wait!

323
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,758
What do you have to say?

324
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,561
I was only mentoring you

325
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:38,731
to punish my son
for becoming a better boy.

326
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,733
- I knew it!
- Where are you going?

327
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,202
I'm gonna get even.
I can't make you stay,

328
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,005
but I can take it out
on your kid.

329
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,541
Not Bart! I do love him!

330
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,694
We're Christians! We're proud!

331
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,830
But don't say it too loud.

332
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:13,833
Holding hands are holy hands.

333
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,868
Are you wearing lotion?

334
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:17,937
I'm very chappy.

335
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,440
Welcome, Christians.

336
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:57,109
God is pleased to thank
our corporate sponsor,

337
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,778
C. Montgomery Burns.

338
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,881
Why won't you die?

339
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:04,550
Mr. Burns
will take questions later.

340
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:07,119
Thanks to this magnificent parade,

341
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:10,957
you right-wing ding-dongs
will keep me in office forever.

342
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,330
And now, at the spectacular
culmination of the parade,

343
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,266
when the final float
has safely cleared the route,

344
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,268
a giant pair of praying hands

345
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,437
will swing from
the sides of the street

346
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,239
and come together in holy union.

347
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,347
He's gonna crush Bart!

348
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,715
Where's Flanders now?

349
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,516
Right here.
What do you need?

350
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,385
Get away from me!

351
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:58,404
No...!

352
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,113
Hi, Dad.

353
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,016
Son, you want to ride
in the ambulance together?

354
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,351
That's always been our thing.

355
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:20,192
- Dad?
- Yes, son?

356
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,495
Can I have a hit
off your oxygen?

357
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,363
Of course.

358
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,533
I'm a great dad.

359
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,378
I'm sorry I was using you.
You're a sweet kid.

360
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,914
One day we'll have a beer
about this and laugh.

361
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,516
- Can it be tomorrow?
- Sure.

362
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:47,053
But for today,
I know a certain stupid someone

363
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,456
who might be a little better
at this than me.

364
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,063
- What's the matter, son?
- You wouldn't understand.

365
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,065
A rich church usher like you.

366
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,067
Hey, I got two troublemakers
of my own.

367
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,235
Who told you boys
you could clean up this dump?

368
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,403
No one.

369
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,405
I think I just might understand
how you feel.

370
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:08,841
You lost a dad.
I lost two Mrs. Flanderses.

371
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:11,343
Maybe my boys and I could take
you to a ball game sometime.

372
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,345
- What do you say?
- Papa!

373
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,148
We have a brother!

374
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,651
Mean foster brother.

375
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:26,459
God bless Rod and Todd and
especially my wonderful mentor,

376
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,127
Mr. Flanders.

377
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:29,428
Amen.

378
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:32,098
Let me get fresh napkins
for everyone.

379
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,433
Hey, how's it going?

380
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,837
Still can't believe you've
renounced the way of the bully.

381
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,506
What can I say?
People change.

382
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,819
Tell me again,
why did I trade Flanders for you?

383
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:56,155
Because we can do this.
