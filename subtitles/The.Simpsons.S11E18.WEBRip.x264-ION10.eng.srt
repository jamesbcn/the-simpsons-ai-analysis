00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:06,554
CHORUS: <i>♪ The Simpsons ♪</i>

2
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:12,045
(theme music playing)

3
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,808
(bell ringing)

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,280
(whistle blows)

5
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,278
(beeping)

6
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:38,866
(playing the blues)

7
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,310
(honking horn)

8
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,022
(tires screeching)

9
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,939
D'oh. (screams)

10
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,784
(tires screeching)

11
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,778
(all screaming)

12
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,882
{\an8}Ah, trash night.

13
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,300
{\an8}In France, they call it
<i>La Nuit Des Poubelles.</i>

14
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,630
{\an8}In Germany, it's "Crappenfest."

15
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,886
{\an8}I can't believe it only comes
52 times a year.

16
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,469
{\an8}Quit gabbing and start grabbing.

17
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,684
{\an8}And remember the best stuff is usually

18
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,055
{\an8}deep in the garbage juice.

19
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,731
{\an8}See? A new pacifier for Maggie.

20
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,358
{\an8}Looky here. Cardy-board tubes.

21
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,361
{\an8}Now we can have indoor plumbing

22
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,743
{\an8}just like they's got
at the women's lock-up.

23
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,781
{\an8}They spoilt you, Brandine.

24
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:58,494
{\an8}Sometimes I don't even know
who you are anymore.

25
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,454
{\an8}Ha! Looks like Milhouse's mom

26
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,288
{\an8}finally threw out his blanky.

27
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,963
{\an8}He'll pay a lot to get this back.

28
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,843
{\an8}Especially when we send it
to him piece by piece.

29
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,839
{\an8}(evil laughing)

30
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,170
(groaning)

31
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,085
(humming)

32
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,134
Shh. Quiet.

33
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,394
{\an8}It seems I will never sell
these <i>She-Hulk vs.</i>

34
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,060
{\an8}<i>Leon Spinks Comics.</i>

35
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,929
{\an8}Worst cross-over ever.

36
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,061
{\an8}(mumbling)

37
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,896
(screaming)

38
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,074
Shoo, nerds, shoo!

39
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,442
(chittering)

40
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,701
{\an8}Well, this muscle shirt's
a pretty good find.

41
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,203
{\an8}Dad, that's a sports bra.

42
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,155
All I know is, I'm finally getting

43
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,325
the support I need.

44
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,213
Look, Dad, barber hair.

45
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,210
(sniffing)

46
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,671
{\an8}Ooh, Italian.

47
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,127
Hey, Vinnie, how's about a pizza?

48
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,723
I got-a no job.

49
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,589
{\an8}(gasps) Mama Mia.

50
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,929
Look what the
Hawaiian restaurant threw out.

51
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,467
Get out of my dreams and into my car.

52
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,806
(hissing)

53
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,984
{\an8}I don't remember the air
in the kitchen being so wavy.

54
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,016
{\an8}(sniffs) Good lord, that's gas.

55
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,824
(grunts)

56
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,612
HOMER: Behold,

57
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,236
I am king Talkie-Tiki.

58
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,624
(both scream)

59
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,700
{\an8}Hey, Flanders.

60
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,494
{\an8}Can your god do that?

61
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,995
{\an8}Actually, Homer, you
and I worship the same god, so...

62
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:30,341
{\an8}HOMER: Irregardless, I am your God now.

63
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:31,787
(grunts)

64
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:32,998
(laughing)

65
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,257
{\an8}Homer, you just can't reroute

66
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,719
{\an8}the gas line.

67
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,298
{\an8}Do you know how dangerous that is?

68
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,513
{\an8}HOMER: Do not anger Talkie-Tiki!

69
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,104
{\an8}I am all-power...

70
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,103
{\an8}-(screams)
-I'll be at Moe's.

71
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,022
{\an8}So I says to the cop,

72
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,601
{\an8}"No, <i>you're </i>driving under the influence

73
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,227
{\an8}of being a jerk."

74
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,524
{\an8}(laughing)

75
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,284
{\an8}(sighs)

76
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,530
{\an8}Hey, Barney, what's with the glum face?

77
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,032
You glum or something? Huh, glummy?

78
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,826
You know, it was my birthday last week

79
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,199
and no one remembered.

80
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,445
What are you, nuts?

81
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,206
I threw you a party at my house.

82
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,498
You lie!

83
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,921
Why would I not remember my own...

84
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,459
-Birthday?
-But we did have

85
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,755
a shindig for you, Barn.

86
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,548
We even videotaped it. Look.

87
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,550
MOE: Oh, that's it, baby.

88
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,808
All for Moe.

89
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,886
Oh, yeah, work the slot.

90
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,175
Show me the package.

91
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,689
(chuckles) Whoa...
That's, that's a project

92
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,810
I'm working on. Sorry.

93
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,654
BART: OK, Mom, we're rolling.

94
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,232
I wrote a poem for Barney

95
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,607
on this special occasion.

96
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,153
"Now that you're one year older,

97
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,658
the time flew by so fast..."

98
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,490
-Bart!
-(Bart laughs)

99
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,535
Give me that.

100
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,618
(grunts)

101
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,913
I'm just saying that,

102
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,206
when we die

103
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,499
there's going to be a planet

104
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,501
for the French,

105
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,422
a planet for the Chinese,

106
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,421
and we'll all be a lot happier.

107
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,343
Mr. Gumbel, you're upsetting me.

108
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,422
No, I'm not.

109
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:02,553
{\an8}Gee, is that who I look like
when I'm drunk?

110
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:03,965
You wish.

111
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,433
That's the stage we call

112
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,853
Professor Barney--

113
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,555
Talkative, coherent, even insightful.

114
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,192
Here's drunk.

115
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,899
(spueaking)

116
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,569
(high voice) Well, I'm off to market.

117
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,569
(belches)

118
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,610
Marge, you're making

119
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,033
a complete fool of your...

120
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,316
Oh, it's just Barney.

121
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,735
(screams)

122
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,616
(gasps) Precious alcohol

123
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,576
soaking into shag.

124
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,665
(growls)

125
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,551
Oh, how embarrassing.

126
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,419
How did this happen?

127
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,255
Oh, that. You've had that for a while.

128
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,512
Yeah, I can't really
picture you without it.

129
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:47,012
Oh, I'm a disgrace.

130
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,056
Disgracefully hilarious.

131
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,060
You passed out before we could
even give you your presents.

132
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,143
I still got mine.

133
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,227
Barney, I got you what

134
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,522
no drunk can do without--

135
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,395
Morning-after stationery.

136
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,732
(laughing)

137
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,067
And I got you helicopter flying lessons.

138
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,323
Can you imagine this boozebag
at the wheel of a whirlybird?

139
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,326
(laughs) He'd be all "look at me--

140
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,828
I'm a tanked-up loser in a helicopter!"

141
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,501
(laughs)

142
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,250
Ah, anyway, happy b-day, punkin.

143
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,208
So, I'm a tanked-up loser?

144
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,258
Is that how you see me?

145
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,843
Oh, sounds like a certain loser

146
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,256
could use some tanking up.

147
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,431
(grunts)

148
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,564
Hey, hey. Where you going?

149
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,560
I'll show you. I'm going to take

150
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,142
these helicopter lessons.

151
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,347
Wait a minute, Barney.

152
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,228
You got to be sober to fly.

153
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,943
I mean, it's not like driving a car.

154
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,815
And I'm going to quit drinking.

155
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,860
(laughing)

156
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:43,994
No, I mean it.

157
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,030
(laughing)

158
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,374
You won't see me here again, <i>ever.</i>

159
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,079
(laughs)

160
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,575
Wait, that ain't funny.

161
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,913
He's my best customer.

162
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,667
Well, the handwriting's on the wall.

163
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,249
To stay afloat, this bar's
going to have to go queer.

164
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,587
You mean, it's not?

165
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,590
Oh!

166
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,671
Wrong again,

167
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,505
<i>Gay Guide to Springfield.</i>

168
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,601
Farewell, my long-necked friends.

169
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,312
(grunts)

170
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:24,148
All right, world, get ready
to meet the clean and sober

171
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,395
Barney Gumbel.

172
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,662
Whee!

173
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,025
Give me a beer.

174
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,776
I knew you'd be back.

175
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,333
(quietly) Santeria, you're the greatest.

176
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,076
Barney, didn't you say you
were going to stop drinking?

177
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,956
I know... but it's so hard!

178
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,713
Please help me, Homer!

179
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,205
You came to the right guy.

180
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,629
I'll straighten you out

181
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,335
right after I finish this beer.

182
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,597
(sighs)

183
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,524
Ah, man, that's sweet.

184
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,141
OK, let's go.

185
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:03,225
{\an8}My name is Barney,
and... I'm an alcoholic.

186
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,776
I feel for you, pally, but, uh, you want
A.A.-- This is triple "A."

187
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,901
Oh. My name is Homer,

188
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,107
and I'm planning a trip

189
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,987
-to St. Louis.
-East St. Louis?

190
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,953
Is there any other St. Louis?

191
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,409
(indistinct chatter)

192
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,745
Ah, welcome back, Homer.

193
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,792
I see you've finally hit rock bottom.

194
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,418
(scoffing) Not a chance.

195
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,255
I can sink <i>way </i>lower.

196
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,220
I just came to help my friend Barney.

197
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,090
We all know why we're here, don't we?

198
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,061
To keep ourselves sober and to network.

199
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,258
So let's get started.

200
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,638
Well, after I lost

201
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,314
my third job in two days

202
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,522
old Gil was in a pit of despair.

203
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,153
And that's when you realized
you were an alcoholic.

204
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,861
Oh, no, I never touch the stuff,

205
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,321
but you don't have to be drunk
to know the value of Amway.

206
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,531
-Oh.
-Huh-huh.

207
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,701
Now, this is used crankcase oil

208
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,870
which you ladies know is
murder to clean up, you know

209
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,410
and company's coming.

210
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,623
Ah! You're doing this

211
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,292
at the worst possible time.

212
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,911
GIL: Ah, your finger is in my eye.

213
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,709
I have a problem with alcohol,
and I need help.

214
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,134
Well, your recovery begins today

215
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,973
and we promise you all the sugar cookies

216
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,008
and secondhand smoke you can handle.

217
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,262
These sugar cookies you speak of--

218
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,474
Are they real or symbolic?

219
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,095
They're on that table over there.

220
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,891
Oh, I don't want to walk <i>that </i>far.

221
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:24,558
Anything that takes 12 steps
isn't worth doing.

222
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,857
Get it? Huh? 12?

223
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:27,861
(laughing)

224
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:28,992
Steps?

225
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,565
Hey, how did I get out here?

226
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,413
(giggling)

227
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,871
Hurt everyone.

228
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,041
Did Gaga just say "hurt everyone"?

229
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,500
(laughing) Gaga-- cute name.

230
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,461
ANNOUNCER<i>: The Springfield phone book</i>

231
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,790
<i>needs a new cover.</i>

232
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,214
-It does?
-It does?

233
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,383
<i>Send us your snapshots,</i>

234
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,590
<i>and, if we select yours,</i>

235
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,840
<i>you win a fabulous</i>

236
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,051
<i>mystery prize.</i>

237
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,051
<i>To enter, send your film</i>

238
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,132
<i>to this address.</i>

239
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,676
<i>Too quick? Try again.</i>

240
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,763
<i>Did you get it? Here it is.</i>

241
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:56,925
<i>Coming in from the left.</i>

242
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,756
<i>Don't delay. Do it today!</i>

243
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,058
You think we should enter?

244
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,351
Well, it shouldn't be too hard

245
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,604
to beat the old photo.

246
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,725
(Lisa exclaims)

247
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,732
Hmm, it's gotta be here somewhere.

248
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,572
Hey, here's a camera.

249
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,870
And it's still got a roll of film in it.

250
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,369
Man, these old cameras
are really built solid.

251
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,293
Bart, we need that to win the contest.

252
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,501
Win the what now?

253
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,049
(sighs)

254
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,129
Here it goes.

255
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,258
So he's so busy worrying
about the front rotor

256
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,842
he walks right into the back one.

257
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,596
(laughing)

258
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,180
Only in this business.

259
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,559
I'd like to sign up
for helicopter lessons.

260
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,562
Sorry, pal, but it takes
a special kind of man

261
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,895
to pilot these birds.

262
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:47,979
I got a coupon.

263
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,114
OK, get in.

264
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,568
Elvis played a chopper pilot one time.

265
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,873
He made so many darn mistakes

266
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,201
We were just laughing at him.

267
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,584
Great singer, though.

268
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,701
Oh, absolutely. You know

269
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,787
who else I like

270
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,831
is that, uh, Leo Sayer.

271
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,462
Anyway, we're nice and level now.

272
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,502
How'd you like to take the controls?

273
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,046
You think I'm ready?

274
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,799
Sure, I do. One sec.

275
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,051
Testing black box-- one, two.

276
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,054
(screaming)

277
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,005
She's all yours, friend.

278
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,099
BARNEY: Whoa! Whoa!

279
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,234
Oh!

280
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,440
Oh! Hey!

281
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,398
I think I'm getting it.

282
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,770
Yes, that's great.

283
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,858
Now let's just pull ourselves

284
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,572
out of this tailspin here.

285
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,201
Ooh! Oh, I'm sorry about that.

286
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,831
It's OK. That's what the diapers are for.

287
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,422
Now, when the mamma bird
returns to feed her babies,

288
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,128
we'll have a prize-winning picture.

289
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,128
Lisa, people these days don't
want to see a baby bird.

290
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,961
They want to see celebrities
at their worst.

291
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,505
(bell rings)

292
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,468
Is that Rainier Wolfcastle?

293
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,722
Check out the gut.

294
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:01,973
It's for a movie.

295
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,814
I'm playing a fat secret agent.

296
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,564
Hey, Homer.

297
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,015
Oh, no, no, no. Don't sit there.

298
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,895
Take this seat, right next to the tap.

299
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,072
But that's Barney's seat.

300
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,574
Are you trying to make me the new Barney?

301
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,413
Hey, every bar needs a world-class drunk.

302
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,409
Yeah, someone who makes
our alcoholism seem less raging.

303
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,238
Well, forget it, guys.

304
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,657
I am not Barney.

305
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,656
(belches)

306
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,577
(all laughing)

307
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,418
See, Homer? It's not so bad.

308
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,541
Now dance, Rummy!

309
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,088
O-OK.

310
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,511
(mumbling melody)

311
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,807
You danced for hours just because
they told you to?

312
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,850
If I didn't, I'd lose their respect.

313
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,733
(helicopter approaching)

314
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,269
Check it out, Homer!

315
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,983
I'm flying this thing!

316
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,023
Get it away from the house!

317
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,357
Want to go for a ride?

318
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,442
Can I, Marge? Can I?

319
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,486
Yes, go! Just go!

320
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,239
So you missed some big changes at Moe's.

321
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,985
He hangs newspapers over the urinals now.

322
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,617
You can read the sports page
while you pee!

323
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,789
Very la-di-da.

324
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,884
I've made some big changes, too.

325
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,089
Can you believe I'm flying
this helicopter?

326
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,420
Powerlines! Powerlines!

327
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,505
Whoops, sorry.

328
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,838
When I think about all the time
I've wasted at Moe's...

329
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:24,928
Wasted?

330
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,512
What about our staring contests

331
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,929
and the way we always knew
what football coaches

332
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,976
should've done Remember the day we jumped

333
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,150
that census guy and stole his clicker?

334
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,729
Those are all priceless memories, Homer,

335
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,395
{\an8}but I don't want to do that stuff anymore.

336
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,026
Oh, so you're better than me, is that it?

337
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,861
I didn't say that.

338
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,027
Take me home.

339
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,284
Oh, don't be that way, Homer.

340
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,276
-I'll scream.
-OK, OK.

341
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,251
So how was your ride with Barney?

342
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,753
I don't want to talk about it.

343
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,745
(crying)

344
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:57,836
(slams door)

345
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,550
(sobbing)

346
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,630
(grunts)

347
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,642
(grunting)

348
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,893
Stupid Barney.

349
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,305
Thinks he's too good for me.

350
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,733
Cheer up, Homie.

351
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,061
You don't need friends to be happy.

352
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,266
I haven't had a friend in years.

353
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,477
But you've got me.

354
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,527
What have I got?

355
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,989
Oh. Well, you still have Lenny and Carl.

356
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,371
Aw, Lenny and Carl suck.

357
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,452
Please don't tell Lenny
and Carl I said that

358
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,084
'cause if I ever lost them as friends...

359
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,620
{\an8}Look, if Barney's that important to you

360
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,624
you've got to work it out.

361
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,326
Old friends stick together

362
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,076
Like O.J. and A.C.

363
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,957
Or <i>The Falcon and the Snowman.</i>

364
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,014
Oh, why can't I have a nickname?

365
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,631
(sighs)

366
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,760
LISA: OK, that's it.

367
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,386
Looks good.

368
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,515
Aw, Bart, the bulldog didn't ante.

369
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,227
OK, on three.

370
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,442
One, two...

371
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,653
Perfect! Phone book cover, here I come!

372
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,533
{\an8}-Ha! Ha!
-Hey! No fair!

373
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,951
Oh, we'll never get a good picture.

374
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,030
Hey, why don't we dump
spaghetti on Maggie's head?

375
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,735
That picture's a cliche.

376
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:10,825
Picture?

377
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,249
Hey, Apu, you got any
of those potato chips

378
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,383
that give you diarrhea?

379
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,794
I need to do a little spring cleaning.

380
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,338
They're in the safety cabinet.
I'll get the key.

381
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,512
(bell rings)

382
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,800
Oh, hello, Homer.

383
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,387
Barney.

384
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,390
Beer, huh?

385
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,391
That's right.

386
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,602
Enjoy.

387
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,141
-That, I will.
-Then we agree.

388
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,184
{\an8}You keep thinking that.

389
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,637
{\an8}-I will.
-Me, too.

390
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,437
-Good day then.
-Good day, then is right.

391
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,770
-Ta.
-Ta-ta.

392
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:40,855
(bell rings)

393
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,897
Hey, you did not pay for that beer!

394
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,651
(yells)

395
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,202
Boy, you can see everything

396
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,582
from Mount Springfield--

397
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,699
The squidport, the old monorail...

398
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,786
BART: The play-doh factory.

399
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,786
(buzzer)

400
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,504
Crescent moon! Crescent moon!

401
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,126
(clicking)

402
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,592
Come on, Springfield.

403
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,672
Sparkle for me, baby.

404
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,128
That's it.

405
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:08,803
Heads up!

406
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:09,934
Ow!

407
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,800
Bart, that's hot.

408
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:12,967
I said, "Heads up."

409
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,810
(crackling)

410
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,271
Lenny, Carl, I know a lot
of people badmouth you

411
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,067
and focus on how you suck, but not me.

412
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,573
To me, you're true blue.

413
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,284
Aw, thanks, big guy.

414
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,534
Now dance, Rummy!

415
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,525
OK.

416
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,536
(mumbling melody)

417
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,497
Hiya, Moe.

418
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,078
Well, if it isn't little

419
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,873
Miss I'm-not-wasting- my-life-anymore--

420
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,128
Which he <i>is.</i>

421
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,666
Moe, I've come here to make amends

422
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,673
for my disgraceful behavior
over the last 20 years.

423
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,166
No, that's OK, Barn.

424
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,298
No, it's not OK.

425
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,894
I broke barstools,

426
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,429
befouled your broom closet

427
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,852
and made sweet love to your pool table

428
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,351
which I then befouled.

429
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,443
Well, that would explain
the drop-off in play.

430
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,519
<i>This is a Channel Six news bulletin.</i>

431
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,232
{\an8}<i>Fire has broken out on Mount Springfield</i>

432
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,855
<i>trapping two youngsters and their camera.</i>

433
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,863
Oh, no! That's Bart and Lisa!

434
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,122
<i>Unfortunately, fire trucks are</i>
<i>unavailable to fight the blaze</i>

435
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,618
<i>as they're all being used to film the new</i>
<i>Burt Reynolds movie</i>

436
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,241
Fireball and Mudflap.

437
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,116
<i>I caught up with Burt on the set.</i>

438
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,996
<i>So, Burt, tell us a little</i>

439
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,791
<i>about </i>Fireball and Mudflap.

440
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,955
Well, I play Jerry "Fireball" mudflap,

441
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,714
a feisty supreme court justice

442
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,455
who's searching for his birth-mother

443
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,917
while competing in a cross-country
fire truck race.

444
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,428
It's garbage.

445
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,894
Barney, you got to fly us
up there and save my kids!

446
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:38,973
{\an8}I can't.

447
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,638
{\an8}I've never flown solo.

448
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,146
Barney, the call is from heroism.

449
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,439
Will you accept the charges?

450
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,355
(flames crackling)

451
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,737
Where you going? The fire's that way!

452
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,236
I know, I know!

453
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,286
I haven't learned right turns yet.

454
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,749
Aah! Look out!

455
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,209
(screaming)

456
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:06,995
(cars honking)

457
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,376
(tires screeching)

458
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,957
I can't do this.

459
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,378
My nerves are shot.

460
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,934
(tires screeching)

461
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,222
(clattering)

462
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,391
Beer! That's what I need!

463
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,387
Barney, no, don't!

464
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,597
Yes, I need it!

465
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,686
(moans)

466
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,402
No! You've got to be sober for this.

467
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,532
Give me that!

468
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,526
Ew, it's warm.

469
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,735
You can't drink them all!

470
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,862
Oh, yes, I can.

471
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,198
(both grunting)

472
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,282
Give me that!

473
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,079
(tops popping)

474
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,290
(gulping)

475
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,463
I won't let you give up now
when you've worked so hard

476
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,923
(slurring) to be the greatest pal

477
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,173
in the world.

478
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,375
I love you.

479
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,005
Let's not lose touch after graduation.

480
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,353
(snoring)

481
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,564
You brave man.

482
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,137
You took six silver bullets for me.

483
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,648
Stay away from my wife!

484
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,149
(groans)

485
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,979
Looks like it's up to me.

486
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,539
(both panting)

487
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:23,953
We should be safe up here.

488
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,997
I'm pretty sure fires can't climb trees.

489
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,121
Ow!

490
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,127
Dad!

491
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,208
Hi, kids!

492
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,633
-(laughing)
-Hang on!

493
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,881
I'll throw you a ladder!

494
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,803
(all screaming)

495
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,217
(shrieks) Get off! Get off!

496
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,473
(thuds)

497
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,402
(both whimpering)

498
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,108
Dad, help!

499
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,899
All right, I'm coming!

500
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:52,942
Whoa!

501
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,275
(screams)

502
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,819
Let me know if you're going
to do that again, Homer.

503
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,785
You did it, Dad.

504
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,418
You can't prove I did it.

505
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:18,175
No, you saved our lives.

506
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,298
I could do a lot of things
if I had some money.

507
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,426
What?

508
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,182
Now <i>there's </i>a picture.

509
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:31,902
Kids!

510
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,570
The new phone books are here

511
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,899
and your picture's on the cover!

512
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,686
-All right!
-Wow, cool!

513
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,778
Let me see!

514
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,824
(both scream)

515
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,820
MARGE: Isn't it adorable?

516
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,538
I guess some baby pictures
were on that old roll of film.

517
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,659
Aw, we'll be the laughingstock
of the whole town.

518
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,917
Well, at least we won the bike.

519
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,289
Actually, I took the picture.

520
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,877
So I gave my prize to the orphanage.

521
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,303
-What?
-How could you?

522
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,421
Just kidding.

523
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,927
I would never do that.

524
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,483
Well, I'm glad we're friends again.

525
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,598
Yeah.

526
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,557
So what do you call this stuff?

527
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,935
A double tall mocha latte.

528
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,732
It's not bad.

529
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,357
Well, it ain't beer.

530
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,321
But at least I got
that monkey off my back.

531
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,407
Oh... (belches)

532
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,706
Nobody gets away from Moe.

533
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,627
{\an8}Nobody.

534
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,417
(steam hissing)

535
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,931
(laughs)

536
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,640
(coughs)

537
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,971
-(murmuring)
-Shh.
