direction and speed of
the stone

to give it a try?

with marshmallows
floating in the foam.

90
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,626
And if, from now
till the end of time,

91
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,967
someone should ask
what we were doing

92
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,103
on the eve of the
17th of November,

93
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,560

Where'd you learn
to sweep like that?

99
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,216
I've been training
all my life.

100
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,853
I once swept red wine
off a white carpet.

101
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,851
I like your style, Blue.

102
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,143
Want to join our team?

103
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,846
If Homer can join with me.

104
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,976
Fine. You two are off the team.

105
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,653
I see.

106
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,861
Well, I guess we can return
these bodysuits to the store.

107
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,783
Hmm.

108
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,572
{\an8}So, we'd just
thrown a biter,

109
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,616
and Homer said to kick
harder off the hack.

110
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,000
So I did and I almost
fouled the hog line!

Exciting, exciting.

113
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,634
I just have one question:
Is curling a real thing?

114
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,249
Yeah, or is it just a cover
story for a grown-up thing

115
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,746
we're not allowed
to know about?

116
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,958
Yeah, like the time you said

117
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,967
Dad was taking a weekend
leadership seminar,

118
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,299
when he was really stuck
in a barrel at the junkyard?

119
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,045
Curling is real.

120
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,927

I've ever done.

122
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,523

that I'm not here
on school business.

130
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,567
I'm here on "cool"
business, i.e. curling.

Astonishing news out of
Eau Claire, Wisconsin.

135
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,126
The Olympic Committee has
announced that Mixed Curling

136
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,499
will be a Demonstration Event
at the Winter Olympics.

137
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,877
There's a Winter Olympics?

138
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,594
(Christmas music plays)

139
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,853
(laughing)

140
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,272
Homer, while you were imagining
what the Winter Olympics were,

141
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:56,362
Seymour said we were all
going to the Olympic trials!

142
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,649
Olympic trials, eh?

143
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,454
He usually stays out like
this for about 30 seconds.

144
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,858
Want some coffee?

145
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,236
Mmm, that'd be great.

146
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,544
Terrible, Seymour!

147
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,002
You're a disgrace
to frozen water!

148
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,503
You love your son.

149
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,214
How can you be
so hard on him?

150
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,884
Marge, love has nothing
to do with winning.

151
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,844

<i>boy, on leave from Korea.</i>

153

154
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,478
<i>three minutes of sex</i>
<i>and a lifetime of regret.</i>

155
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:40,937

<i>and I went back to my dream:</i>

156

<i>pole vaulting in the</i>
<i>Helsinki Olympics.</i>

157
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,911
<i>But there was a bump</i>

<i>The whole nine months,</i>

160

<i>he ruined my life.</i>

Yes, that involuntary
pre-conscious reflex

167
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,314
I made in utero
was unforgivable.

168
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,929
The point is,
don't let your feelings

169
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,765
get in the way of winning.

170
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,401
They don't give out medals
for being a loving wife.

Sweep, sweep.

Excuse me?

186
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,974
I think this fell
off your hat.

187
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,932
Oh, thanks! That's Chilbert.

188
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,103
One of the four
Winter Games mascots.

189
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,772
Would you like it?
I've got doubles.

190
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,890
Thank you.

191
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,230
Just beware, collecting Olympic
pins can be kind of addictive.

192
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:06,235
(chuckles) Come on,
they're just pins.

193
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,529

00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,521
Sorry, but I was planning

00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,101
to stop by
the Olympic Pin Center

254
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,646
to fill in a few small gaps
in my collection.

255
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,730
You know,
just to get me through the day.

I'll go first. Isn't he cute?

A little.

267
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,636
But as an Olympic curler,
he's dragging us down

268
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,389

We know. That's
why we're positive

272
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,524
he'll never
get any better.

273
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,612
I had one Olympics ruined
by a bald, drooling idiot,

275
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,781
I was not bald.

276
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,649
My fontanel was covered
by lanugo.

277
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,606
Whatever.

278
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,275
We want Homer
off the team.

279
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,243
Well, who made
you the coach?

280
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,283
The hat
makes me the coach.

281
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:27,537

and you don't dump a soul mate.

282
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,621
Oh, my God,
I'm holding back the team.

283
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,957
But our marriage is based
on curling.

284
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,962
Oh, what am I gonna do?

285
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,134
Hmm...

286
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,007

287
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,520
Hmm...

288
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,517
Hmm.

289
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,694

Oh, my gosh.

293
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,947
It's the mascot
from the 1924 games in Chamonix.

294
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,664
That's right.
It's Ennui, himself.

295
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,245
I must have him.

296
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,000
Um... can I have it
on account?

297
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,581
On account of I want it?

298
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,916

You've heard that one, huh?

300
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,554
No, it's just not
funny the first time.

301
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,760
But if you want to
trade, I could take--

302
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,430
uh, oh, I don't know--
those pearls you're wearing.

303
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,010
My pearls?

304
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,764
These were a gift from my mom

305
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,056
when I could first read
at a twelfth grade level.

306
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,060
You want to yak, or
you want to trade?

307
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,232
(whimpers)
Just take them.

308
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,188

310
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,035
I saw you grooving to the beat.

311
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,500
You got to pay for that.

312
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,750
Lis, what's going on?

313
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,542
You're not normally
this interesting.

314
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,955
Nothing's going on.

315
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,423

Are you sure
you're okay?

320
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,601
I'm fine.

321
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,970
Fine, fine, fine, fine,

What's that noise?

323
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,477
Your dress is covered
with pins.

324
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,942
There is no dress.

325
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,111
It's just pins.

326
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,689

327
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,904
Help me?

-What are you doing?
-I like to warm up.

330
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,285
by sweeping behind
the snack bar.

331

Boo yeah!

332

Uh-oh.

Yes, it will.

337
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,144
I'll just sweep harder
than anyone's ever swept before.

338
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,679
Because without Homer,
I'm a broom without a stone.

339
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,564
No use for anything.

340

Wow. That's

350
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,380
Marge Simpson is sweeping fast
and clean,

351
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,634

352
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,216
I've never seen this before.

353
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,971

to restart a stone.

-(winces)
-Hmm. Sorry, but

371
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,585
I'm afraid
she'll never curl again.

372
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,386
That looks like the end
of team USA's dream.

373
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,720
It appears team Sweden
will clinch the gold,

374
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,386

with joy.

375

I'll do it myself.

379

When we do things together,

380
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,325
they always turn out badly...
for me.

381
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,424
Ooh, you're hot

382
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,169
I'm not horny. I'm mad.

383

Ooh, you're mad

Marge, you're really good
with your left hand.

386
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,638
I should be. I'm left-handed.

387
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,850
I've been using my right hand
all these years

388
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,640
'cause I didn't want
to seem unusual in any way.

389
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,310
Hmm.

390
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,741

that you can learn
from watching Dad.

392
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,855
The first thing
you have to do is get clean,

393
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,527
so give me your pins.

394
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,285
-All of 'em.
-What is this, tough love?

395
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,748
Uh, it's a little more
like soft hate.

396
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,747
I said, all of them.

397
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,835
(sighs)
Oh.

398
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,263
And now, just put
your pearls back on,

399
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,591
and we'll go get some coffee.

400
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,006
It's not that easy, Bart.

401
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,104
I...

402
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,810
traded away my pearls.

403

Oh. (cries)

404

What'll you take
for the pearls?

407
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,045
Nothing you got,

408
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,591

in Sochi, Russia?

411
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,391
His name is Fatov.

412
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,853
He represents the Russian spirit
of sloth and alcoholism.

00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,975
