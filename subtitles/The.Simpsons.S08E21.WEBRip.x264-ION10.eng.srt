welcome
to our guest speaker--

39
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,437
I know he can teach us
a lot about business--

40
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,068
Mr. C. Montgomery burns.

41
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,623
<i>(scattered applause)</i>

42
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,867
I'll keep it short and sweet.

43
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,834
Family, religion, friendship.

44
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,035
These are the three demons
you must slay

45
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,706
if you wish to succeed
in business.

46
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,804
When opportunity knocks,

47
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,459
you don't want to be driving
to the maternity hospital

48
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,008
or sitting in some
phony baloney church.

49
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,722
Or synagogue.
Questions?

50
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,345
Well, uh, I'm going
to take advantage

51
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,023
of this rare opportunity

52
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,352
even if you children
aren't interested.

53
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,687
Which do you think
is more important--

54
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,612
hard work
or stick-to-itiveness?

55
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,242
-Are there any real questions?
-Yes.

56
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,819
Um, does your plant
have a recycling program?

57
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:39,115
Re-cy-cling?

58
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,304
I'm afraid I'm not familiar
with that term,

59
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,459
you adorable little ragamuffin.

60
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,298
Hmm. You never heard
of recycling?

61
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,763
It means to reuse things

62
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,343
to conserve our natural
resources.

63
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,718
Oh, so Mother Nature
needs a favor.

64
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,015
Well, maybe she should
have thought of that

65
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,139
when she was besetting us with droughts
and floods and poison monkeys.

66
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,936
Nature started the fight
for survival,

67
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,020
and now she wants to quit
because she's losing.

68
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,685
Well, I say-- hard cheese.

69
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,363
But nature's not our enemy.

70
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,492
Well, surely, you agree
we can do without her.

71
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,359
No, I don't agree.

72
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,446
No?

73
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,070
How dare you question Mr. Burns?

74
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,487
I'll handle it, Smithers.

75
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,535
(chuckles)
Shut up, little girl.

76
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,409
If I had spent my life listening
to dismal Doras like you,

77
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,916
I wouldn't be worth
$200 million today.

78
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,079
But according to your
most recent biography,

79
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,958
you only have
$100 million today.

80
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,495
I... I...

81
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,378
(sputters)

82
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,966
Um...

83
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,391
Actually, sir, it's...

84
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,219
considerably less than that.

85
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,180
I, um... have to go.

86
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,518
<i>(clapping alone)</i>

87
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,694
Monty Burns, everybody.

88
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,107
I've called you all here

89
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,152
because I need
some honest answers.

90
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,896
What is my current
financial situation?

91
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,317
-Great.
-Great.

92
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,115
-I hear great.
-All right, well,

93
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,369
let's have a look
at my stock portfolio.

94
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,582
Hmm. Confederated Slaveholdings.
How's that doing?

95
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,705
It's, uh... uh, steady.

96
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,383
I'm sure all your stocks
are doing well, sir.

97
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,051
-After all, you chose them.
-(murmuring approval)

98
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,720
Well, let's get out the old
stock ticker and have a look.

99
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,512
Here's where I stopped
checking it last time--

100
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,766
September, 1929...

101
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,639
Oh, no... Oh, no.

102
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,767
Oh, no.

103
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,234
Smithers, why didn't you tell me
about this market crash?

104
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,985
Um, well, sir, it happened
25 years before I was born.

105
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,029
Oh, that's your excuse
for everything.

106
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,373
I've got to do something
to get my money back quickly.

107
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,328
This calls for an aggressive
trading strategy.

108
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,449
ALL: Good idea, sir.

109
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,786
Take 50% of my money
and put it in the blue chips--

110
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,921
Trans-Atlantic Zeppelin,
Amalgamated Spats,

111
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,669
Congreves Inflammable Powders,
U.S. Hay--

112
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,591
and sink the rest
into that up-and-coming

113
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,420
Baltimore Opera Hat company.

114
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,335
That should set things
right again, eh, boys?

115
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,764
-Absolutely.
-Oh, yes, sir.

116
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,052
Genius. "A" all the way.

117
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,385
Can't go wrong with Congreves.

118
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,935
A half-ton of newspaper,
and all we get is 75 cents?

119
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,571
That won't even cover the gas
I use to go to the store

120
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,438
to buy the twine
to tie up the bundles.

121
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,775
It sounds like
you're working for your car.

122
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,122
Simplify, man.

123
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,578
(muttering)

124
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,698
Sorry, kids,
the trip to Albany is off,

125
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,115
-and there's to be no more recycling.
-(kids protesting)

126
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,254
But we didn't do that badly.

127
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,832
We collected enough paper
to save one whole tree.

128
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,673

129
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,335
CHILD:
Oh, Mommy, help.

130
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,264
Are you saying
my money's all gone?

131
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,555
-ALL: Mm-hmm.
-But...

132
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,388
I made all the right moves,
didn't I?

133
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,354
-Oh, yes, sir.
-Every move a right one.

134
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,854
I see it all now.

135
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,647
You're just a bunch
of yes men.

136
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,191
I was making the wrong moves,

137
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,404
and you were too gutless
to tell me.

138
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,654
Isn't that right?

139
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,395
-Oh, yes, sir.
-Dead on, sir.

140
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,657
Then I'll fix this myself.

141
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,739
Smithers, take out another
mortgage on the plant.

142
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,954
Well, the bank has already
foreclosed on the plant.

143
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,615
And your house, sir.

144
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,923
But... what will I do?

145
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,748
Well, the first thing
you'll have to do

146
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,133
is move out of the bank's house.

147
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,550
-I'll help you pack.
-(whimpers)

148
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,096
(faucet squeaks)

149
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,349
-Go on. Get out of here.
-(birds squawking)

150
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,770
And I'm sure a pro wrestler
such as yourself

151
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,566
will appreciate
all the closet space, Hit Man.

152
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,611
(sniffs)

153
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,323
Ooh...

154
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,364
this place has got
old-man stink.

155
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:49,327
-Ooh...
-Don't listen to him, sir.

156
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,039
You've got an enchanting musk.

157
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,620
And you wouldn't even be
the only wrestler

158
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,254
in the neighborhood.

159
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,711
The Shrieking Sheik lives
just three doors away.

160
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,581
(distant shrieking)

161
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,378
Hey-hey, I'll take it.

162
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:09,675
Uh, would it be all right
if I kept this portrait...

163
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,812
to remind me of better times?

164
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,889
Why would I want a picture of
a pitiful pencil-neck geek?

165
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:15,976
Yeah.

166
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,060
Why, indeed.

167
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,775
I'll make sure he forwards
your social security check, sir.

168
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,405
Mmm. Excellent.

169
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,159
Homer! You didn't tell me
Mr. Burns went broke and lost

170
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,917
the nuclear power plant.

171
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,129
Now, I can't remember
every little thing

172
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,999
that happens in my day.

173
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,256
You told me about that candy
bar you found three times.

174
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,878
You found a candy bar?

175
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,255
Oh, yes.
Gather 'round, my son,

176
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,181
and I shall tell you a tale...

177
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,140
I normally don't laugh
at other people's misfortunes,

178
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,970
but on behalf of
the recycling community...

179
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,806
Ha! It couldn't have happened
to anyone more deserving.

180
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,153
They're not going to close
the plant, are they?

181
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,438
No. The bank
put Lenny in charge.

182
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,689
Uh...

183
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,776
attention, everybody.

184
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,112
Uh...

185
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,238
Uh... work harder. Bye.

186
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,366
-(groans)
-(knuckles crack)

187
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,578
Well, sir,

188
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,126
I have to get to work.

189
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,920
Lenny's a real bear
on tardiness.

190
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,303
Are there any chores I can do?

191
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,391
-(shattering)
-Uh, no, no.

192
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:38,942
Uh, you just stay here
and maintain your dignity.

193
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,598
(door closes)

194
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:45,146
(water dripping)

195
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,693
Ah. Here's a chance
to earn my keep.

196
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,277
I will go out
and get these items

197
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,492
from the food jobber.

198
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,282
Grocery store, please.

199
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,171
I am riding on the bus.

200
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,800
Hey, aren't you that
guy everybody hates?

201
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,418
Oh, my, no.
I'm Monty Burns.

202
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,506
I'm shopping.

203
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,770
Oh, my.

204
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,229
I wonder which is the cereal
for me?

205
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,188
Um, oh, excuse me.

206
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,442
Could you tell me where
I might find the "Burns O's"?

207
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,734
Sorry, pops,
they don't put nobodies

208
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,738
on cereal boxes.

209
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,450
Hmm...

210
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,030
well, I suppose
this one looks a bit like me.

211
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,749
Whoo. Thank you, shoppie.

212
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,332
I ventured
in to search for milk

213
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,337
when the door
snapped shut behind me.

214
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,259
Yeah, those dairy cases
are death traps.

215
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,168
Ketchup.

216
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,877
Catsup.

217
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,087
Ketchup.

218
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,297
Catsup.

219
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,267
Catsup.

220
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,058
Huh. I'm in way over my head.

221
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,023
He's, uh, talking
to the ketchup now.

222
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,403
Burns is sure acting nutty.

223
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,269
Maybe going broke
and losing his plant

224
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,646
destroyed his brain.

225
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,114
Could you come
along with us, sir?

226
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:15,034
Are you here
to solve my ketchup problem?

227
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,284
Yes, that's right.

228
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,004
Where are you taking me?

229
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,500
What's happening?

230
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,252
Relax. You've gone off
your nut,

231
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,504
so we're stuffing you
into an old folks home.

232
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,256
Those, uh, store guys signed
the commitment papers.

233
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,919
But... I'm shopping.

234
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,127
(Homer glugging)

235
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,216
Here you go, honey.

236
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,305
That's about all
the recycling--

237
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,140
(hiccups)
...I can handle today.

238
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,385
Dad, if you just
drink one more,

239
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,307
I'll have a full bag.

240
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,355
Oh, but Daddy
doesn't feel so good.

241
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,860
Uh... there's got to be

242
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,741
more trash around
here somewhere.

243
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:56,408
Hey, why don't you try
the old folks home?

244
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,159
They practically live
in their own filth.

245
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,411
Thanks, Dad.

246
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,163
You're welcome, honey.

247
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,914
That's the activity room.

248
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,246
We're not allowed in there.

249
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,542
That's the library.
Not allowed in there either.

250
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,837
And don't even think about
going in the game room.

251
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,761
Egad, man, how are we
supposed to pass the time?

252
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,470
Best bet is to stake
yourself out a good spot

253
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,351
at the staring window.

254
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,064
(shudders)

255
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,100
<i>♪ Don't tell my heart ♪</i>

256
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,944
<i>♪ My achy-breaky heart ♪</i>

257
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:31,149
<i>♪ I just don't think</i>
<i>it understands ♪</i>

258
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,692
Come on, Mr. Burns,
join the fun!

259
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,485
That's the spirit.

260
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:43,735
So, this is how
the Monty Burns saga ends.

261
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,958
Oh, if I hadn't
surrounded myself

262
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,828
with those spineless yes men...

263
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,205
LISA: What do you mean
you don't have anything to recycle?

264
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,382
You must have some magazines
or newspapers.

265
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,211
That voice. That shrill,
disagreeable voice.

266
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,797
It's her!

267
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,512
Sorry, we're not allowed
to read newspapers.

268
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,723
They angry up the blood.

269
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,394
You! The troublemaking girl!

270
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,562
My name is Lisa, Mr. Burns.
Lisa Simpson.

271
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,602
It doesn't matter,
what your name is, you idiot.

272
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,766
What I want to know is, will you
help me get my money back?

273
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:14,065
Ha. I'd never help you.
You're the worst man in the world.

274
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,570
Yes. That's the kind of
moxie I'm looking for!

275
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,822
-You're hired!
-No, I'm not!

276
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,374
Sir, I'm so sorry
my grocer committed you.

277
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,779
We'll never shop
there again.

278
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,117
Not now, Smithers.

279
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,791
I've got an empire to rebuild.

280
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,790
And the person
who's going to help me is...

281
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,172
that girl.

282
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,538
<i>("That Girl" theme playing)</i>

283
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,422
-Please.
-No.

284
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,564
Please.

285
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,848
No.

286
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,598
-Please.
-No.

287
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,558
(doorbell ringing)

288
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,900
Sir, we've never met before,
but my name is Mr. Burns,

289
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,566
and I want your daughter
to help make me rich again.

290
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:02,735
You mean Maggie?

291
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,826
Ah, the baby who shot me.

292
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,411
No, I was referring
to your other daughter.

293
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,827
Lisa, you have a guest.

294
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,957
So, uh...

295
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,844
How's life in the gutter?

296
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,721
You again?

297
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,259
I've realized the error
of my ways, Lisa.

298
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,143
I need someone with
your integrity to help me.

299
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,560
Please?
Don't refuse this poor old man.

300
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,805
Uh...

301
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,975
well...

302
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,734
if I did agree to help you,
you could only earn money

303
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,236
by doing good,
socially responsible things.

304
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,858
-Nothing evil.
-"Nothing evil."

305
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,866
That's exactly the kind
of radical thinking I need.

306
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,909
It's a deal.

307
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,745
See that, boy?

308
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,870
Why aren't you making
any business deals?

309
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,037
(whining):
I'll do it this afternoon.

310
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,423
You mean there
are actually people

311
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,587
who will pay good
money for garbage?

312
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,216
Not good money, really.

313
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,052
Each can will get you a nickel.

314
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,137
Oh, don't pooh-pooh
a nickel, Lisa.

315
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,483
A nickel will buy you
a steak and kidney pie,

316
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,979
a cup of coffee,
a slice of cheesecake,

317
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,730
and a newsreel,

318
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,732
with enough change left over
to ride the trolley

319
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,614
from Battery Park
to the polo grounds.

320
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,152
There's a can.

321
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,735
You have to cut
these six-pack holders up.

322
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,584
Otherwise,
fish get trapped in them.

323
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,989
I see.

324
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,039
Ha-ha!

325
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,887
My first dollar.
Thanks to you, Lisa

326
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,765
and our hemp-smoking friend.

327
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,152
Shine on, you crazy diamond.

328
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,519
Sounds like somebody's living
in the past.

329
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,938
Contemporize, man.

330
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,567
Well, Lisa, as my advisor,
you're entitled to 10%.

331
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,195
Oh, I'm not doing this
for the money.

332
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,663
I'm just happy knowing
that future generations

333
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,544
will enjoy unspoiled
median strips

334
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,921
and pristine
highway embankments.

335
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,748

00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,453
to just plain stinking.

349
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,793
(laughing)

350
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,539
-Good one, Mom.
-Oh, you're so bad, honey.

351
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,212
You guys shouldn't
laugh at him.

352
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,630
Mr. Burns has changed.
He's different now.

353
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,749
-Yeah, he's broke.
-(laughing)

354
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,007
Two in a row.

355
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,669
(sighing)

356
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,888
Oh, you've really
turned my life around

357
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,555
these past few weeks, Lisa.

358
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,103
I've got my own business again,
my beloved employees.

359
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,607
Oh, consarn it...

360
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,070
Come on, let's pick up the pace,
you neglected old nincompoops.

361
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,821
Mr. Burns, if you want people
to do a good job,

362
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,493
you can't bully them.

363
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,991
You have to show them
they're appreciated.

364
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,243
Ooh, capital idea,
partner.

365
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,695
People, if we meet
this week's quota,

366
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,366
I'll take you
to the most duck-filled pond

367
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,214
you ever sat by.

368
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,869
Oh, hot diggity,
that's how they got me

369
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,328
to vote for Lyndon Larouche.

370
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,921
Wow, even I didn't know

371
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,547
he was so committed
to recycling.

372
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:53,013
See? I told you Mr. Burns
has changed. See?

373
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,135
Lisa, nobody likes a gloater.

374
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,722
-Right, Homey?
-Uh-huh.

375
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,807
See?

376
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,481
(applause)

377
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,981
Yes, thank you, everyone.

378
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,232
But 10% of your applause
should go to

379
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,864
my little partner,
Lisa Simpson.

380
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,691
For, if it were not for her
infectious moralizing,

381
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,607
we would not be here today
to witness the unveiling of--

382
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,367
the Li'l Lisa Recycling Plant.

383
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,580
(applause)

384
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,500
Oh, ain't that cute?

385
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,249
Makes Little Debbie
look like a pile of puke.

386
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,751
Would you like to be the first

387
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,293
to take a tour of the plant,
Li'l Lisa?

388
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,586
I'd love to, partner.

389
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,921
The whole plant
is environmentally sound.

390
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,087
It's powered by old newspapers.

391
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,346
The machinery is made entirely
of used cans, and the windows

392
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,429
are from the old liquor bottles
we collected.

393
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,885
Hey, I thought I told you
to stop licking my windows.

394
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,097
I know, you told me...

395
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,268
and when I woke up
this morning, I said,

396
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,936
"Barney, you're not going
to lick that man's..."

397
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,936
I'm so proud
of you, Mr. Burns.

398
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,738
You're getting
your fortune back,

399
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,411
and you're doing it
without endangering the planet

400
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,530
or cozying up
to the Aspen crowd.

401
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,617
Oh, hold your accolades
till the end of the tour.

402
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,253
You haven't seen
the best part.

403
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,040
I couldn't watch
your demonstration

404
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,883
of the fish caught
in the plastic rings

405
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,878
without getting an idea.

406
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,880
Look out over the water.

407
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,925
I figured if one six-pack holder
will catch one fish,

408
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:19,601
a million sewn together
will catch a million fish.

409
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:20,721
Watch.

410
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,852
What's going on?

411
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,516
Ah, I call it
the "Burns Omni-Net."

412
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,935
it sweeps the sea clean.

413
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,074
(gasps)

414
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,578
Oh, dear God.

415
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,950
BURNS:
I call our product

416
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,956
"Li'l Lisa's
Patented Animal Slurry."

417
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,168
it's a high-protein feed
for farm animals,

418
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,789
insulation
for low-income housing,

419
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,415
a powerful explosive,

420
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,132
and a top-notch
engine coolant.

421
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,762
And best of all,

422
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,929
it's made from 100 percent
recycled animals.

423
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,178
Oh, I think
I'm going to be sick.

424
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,761
Oh, a spoonful of slurry
will cure what ails you.

425
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,228
Ah! You haven't changed at all.

426
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,598
You're still evil,
and when you're trying

427
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,476
to be good,
you're even more evil.

428
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,573
I don't understand.

429
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,068
Pigs needs food,
engines need coolant,

430
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,991
dynamiters need dynamite.

431
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,449
I'm supplying it to them
at a tidy profit,

432
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,780
and not a single
sea creature was wasted.

433
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,696
You inspired it all,
Li'l Lisa.

434
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,958
Stop! Don't recycle!

435
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,843
It's murder!
You're helping Mr. Burns!

436
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,881
(robotic monotone)
But you told us to recycle.

437
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,006
You convinced us
it was good.

438
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,893
No, it's evil!
Please, stop recycling!

439
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:48,814
(robotic monotones) Stop.
You can't mix plastic with paper.

440
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,190
(gasps)
Oh! Oh!

441
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,147
(tires screech)

442
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,239
(sobbing)

443
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:06,246
Oh, I can't get the smell
of slurry out of my clothes.

444
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,080
I was a fool to help
that horrible old man.

445
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,587
I hope you learned
your lesson, Lisa.

446
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,589
Never help anyone.

447
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,171
(doorbell ringing)

448
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,850
Simpson, what are you
doing here?

449
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,889
-Why aren't you at work?
-I made a bad mistake,

450
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,022
and Lenny sent me home
to think about what I did.

451
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,309
But I don't remember what it was,
so I'm watching TV.

452
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,853
Well, Lenny's reign
of terror is over.

453
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,688
Mr. Burns bought
the plant back this morning.

454
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,483
-And--
-Enough chitchat. I need to see Lisa.

455
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,486
I don't want to talk to you,
Mr. Burns.

456
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,198
Oh, I think you will.

457
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,318
You see, I just sold
the Li'l Lisa Recycling Plant

458
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,236
for $120 million.

459
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,656
Congratulations.

460
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,084
Oh, don't congratulate me.

461
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,412
Congratulate
Bay State Fish Sticks.

462
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,328
As my advisor,
you're entitled

463
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,626
to 10% of the proceeds.

464
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,459
(gasping)

465
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,924
Lise, have I told you lately
that I love you?

466
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:02,136
Wow! I've never seen
so much money.

467
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,099
Oh, but I can't accept that,

468
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,560
knowing where it came from.

469
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,311
Can I, Mom?

470
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,143
(groaning)

471
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,728
Lisa, you do whatever
your conscience tells you.

472
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,225
(groans)

473
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,317
No...

474
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,276
Oh, you did the right thing,
sweetheart.

475
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,584
(chuckling)

476
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,333
Well, that's the first case
I've ever seen

477
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,665
of a man suffering four
simultaneous heart attacks.

478
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,751
I'm sorry, Dad.

479
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:40,087
It's all right.
I understand.

480
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:43,393
But we really could have used
that $12,000.

481
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,718
Um... Dad,

482
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,063
10% of $120 million

483
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,269
isn't 12,000, it's...
