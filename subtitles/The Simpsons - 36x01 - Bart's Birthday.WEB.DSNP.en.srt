00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:04,170
<i>The following is a</i>
<i>Fox Special Presentation.</i>

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:09,342
<i>Live from the Dolby-Mucinex Theater</i>
<i>in Hollywood, California.</i>

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:16,307
<i>The biggest stars of stage,</i>
<i>screen, politics and sports</i>

4
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:20,687
<i>have all come out for this landmark night</i>
<i>in television history.</i>

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,775
<i>A-once-in-a-lifetime event,</i>
<i>36 years in the making.</i>

6
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,195
<i>It's </i>The Simpsons<i> series finale!</i>

7
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:39,539
<i>And now, your host for tonight,</i>
<i>Conan O'Brien.</i>

8
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,129
Thank you. Yes, thank you.

9
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:50,425
It's such an honor to be with you all
for the series finale of <i>The Simpsons</i>.

10
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,552
I knew I was the right man for the job

11
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:57,182
'cause I've hosted the last episode
of three of my own shows and counting.

12
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:05,231
Well, it's true.
Fox has decided to end <i>The Simpsons</i>.

13
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,817
This show was such a special part
of my early career,

14
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,986
so being here means the world to me.

15
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,615
Also, I left a sweater
in the writers' room in 1993.

16
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:16,117
This is the only way
they'll let me get it back.

17
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,039
This theater is full
of the many celebrities

18
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,957
who've appeared
on <i>The Simpsons</i> over the years

19
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,709
and who have come to say farewell.

20
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,796
We got you for scale then,
we're getting you for free tonight.

21
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,799
Hey, give yourselves a hand,
you poor, rich chumps!

22
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:38,056
And of course, we're also joined by
the stars of Fox's many live-action hits.

23
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:43,019
I also won <i>The Masked Singer</i> as Disco-pus.

24
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,606
That hasn't aired yet, genius!
You've ruined the whole season!

25
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,316
Oh, shoot!

26
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,444
Over the years, the Simpsons have had
hundreds of adventures,

27
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,781
visited dozens of countries,
most of which still exist.

28
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:58,701
And Bart Simpson has remained
the world's longest-serving ten-year-old.

29
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,329
So, why end <i>The Simpsons</i> now?

30
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,789
Not many people know this,

31
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,375
but Fox has been trying
to end it for years.

32
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:09,921
When the very first episode aired in 1989,
the viewers agreed on one thing.

33
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,090
It wasn't as funny as it used to be.

34
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:15,343
And their expressions
of hatred could serve as a history

35
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,595
of modern communication technology.

36
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:22,225
Fox executives,
unaccustomed to criticism of any kind,

37
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:27,272
immediately caved to public pressure
and decided to end <i>The Simpsons</i> in 1990.

38
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:32,026
Here's a never-before-seen clip
of the first attempt at a series finale.

39
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,611
"Bart the Daredevil."

40
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:38,283
<i>I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it!</i>
<i>This is the greatest thrill of my life!</i>

41
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,286
I'm king of the world! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!

42
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,515
Dad? Dad, speak to me.

43
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,853
No!

44
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,611
However, before
this grim finale could air,

45
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,406
Rupert Murdoch got a $10 million
helium bill for the Bart balloon

46
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,408
in the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade.

47
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:24,370
So Fox had to keep making new episodes
to amortize the cost.

48
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,207
Thus, the quest to end
<i>The Simpsons</i> went on.

49
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,837
In fact, many now-classic episodes were
originally conceived as series finales.

50
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:38,384
Ow! My leg! This is the worst pain ever!

51
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,137
Nothin' at all.

52
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,222
Bravo.

53
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,515
Woo-hoo.

54
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:54,234
But in 2007,
efforts to end the show were put on hold

55
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:59,530
after the massive global success
of <i>The Simpsons Movie</i> porno parody,

56
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,033
the cast of which is here tonight.

57
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:08,122
But now that Fox has rebranded itself
as a dating service for cow tippers,

58
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,625
the time has come
to finally end <i>The Simpsons</i>.

59
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:14,545
But how? The bar had been raised so high
by the classic finales of:

60
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,298
<i>Mad Men, Breaking Bad </i>and<i> The Sopranos,</i>

61
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,218
and lowered
by the legacy-ruining farewells of:

62
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,304
<i>Seinfeld</i>, <i>Lost</i> and <i>The Sopranos</i>.

63
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,723
The producers racked their brains
to create a finale

64
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,686
that would satisfy the show's many fans
and many, many haters.

65
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:34,065
Then they came up with the perfect plan,
foist the job onto somebody else.

66
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,651
Meet that somebody else.

67
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:40,238
I give you the latest in
machine learning artificial intelligence:

68
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,907
Hack-GPT.

69
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,952
This cutting-edge breakthrough
in plagiarism has been programmed

70
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:49,664
to write, animate, and voice
the perfect finale for <i>The Simpsons</i>.

71
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,916
One that wraps up
the characters' storylines

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,835
in emotionally satisfying ways,

73
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,005
but won't damage
the most important legacy of the show:

74
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,424
The 2026 grand opening

75
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:03,886
of Homer Simpson's Claim-Jumping
Yukon-Rumbling Rock-N-Roller Coaster

76
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,847
at Disneyland, Shanghai.

77
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:13,062
To create the ultimate finale,
the AI has been fed every <i>Simpsons</i> episode

78
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:17,400
and the last episode
of every television series ever made.

79
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,738
Hack-GPT is now performing
billions of computations

80
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,698
to create the perfect story.

81
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,616
Who knows how long this process will--

82
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,076
<i>Finale complete.</i>

83
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,162
Oh. Well, that was… was really quick.

84
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,496
Well, let's see what we got.

85
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,796
♪ <i>The Simpsons </i>♪

86
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,756
<i>Finale.</i>

87
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,970
There's my special, little birthday guy.

88
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,264
I'm so pumped for my party tonight.

89
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,975
How many people are coming?
Fifty? A thousand?

90
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,979
I'm a little concerned
I haven't gotten any RSVPs.

91
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,565
Homer, you did mail
the invitations, right?

92
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:01,736
Marge, I could lie and tell you
what you want to hear, but I won't.

93
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:02,820
I mailed the invitations.

94
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,614
And the reason no one is coming is…

95
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,492
-because everybody hates Bart.
-Huh?

96
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,828
Homer.

97
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:14,874
Your selfishness is going
to be topic number one

98
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,834
with our new therapist tonight.

99
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,339
Woo-hoo! No time to talk about
my problem drinking and solution snacking.

100
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,217
Oh, great. I have eight hours
to hand these out

101
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,305
to all my friends
or my birthday party's gonna be ruined!

102
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:35,728
You ran billions of computations
and that's what you come up with?

103
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,314
Homer screws up Bart's birthday party?

104
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,483
<i>Got anything better?</i>

105
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,068
Uh…

106
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,195
I think the birthday party could work.

107
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:52,120
Okay, <i>The Simpsons</i> series finale.

108
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,372
The AI has worked out a satisfying story

109
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:57,250
full of sweet character moments
and happy endings.

110
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,044
Are we sure about Bart's birthday?

111
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,756
<i>Birthdays are relatable, Conan.</i>

112
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,051
<i>And the lost invitations</i>
<i>raise the stakes.</i>

113
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,805
Are you AI network executives?

114
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:15,476
<i>We have been programmed with every</i>
<i>network note in the history of television.</i>

115
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,437
<i>We have some thoughts.</i>

116
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,481
<i>Maybe Marge has </i>
<i>an aspirational new job,</i>

117
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,817
<i>not this, but owns a cupcake store?</i>

118
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,360
<i>To piggyback off that,</i>

119
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,447
<i>let's remind the viewer</i>
<i>that Homer likes food.</i>

120
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,115
<i>If we go down that road,</i>

121
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,493
<i>can Moe be played by Topher Grace?</i>
<i>He's a friend.</i>

122
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,495
Shut up. Just play the show.

123
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,080
Bart's birthday!

124
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,125
Here you go, come to my party.

125
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,128
Wendell, Lewis,
Sunglasses Kid with no name.

126
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,755
Uter. Look who's alive!

127
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,508
Students, I've called
this assembly because

128
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:51,179
today is my last day as your principal.

129
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,222
You are looking at the new Headmaster

130
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,017
of the Sacramento Obedience Academy
for the Meek.

131
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,769
Where I'll, no doubt,
find a whole new eclectic cast

132
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,563
of characters to interact with.

133
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,232
Also, Groundskeeper Willie
will be my roommate.

134
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,693
What an odd couple we'll make.

135
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:09,697
No more Skinner? Oh, man.
This is the best birthday present ever.

136
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,702
And who knows? Maybe I'll make
an occasional appearance in Sacramento.

137
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,247
I look forward to one high jink or more

138
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:22,627
as part of this delightful mid-season
replacement of the retiring principal.

139
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,711
Mmm.

140
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,630
School dismissed.

141
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:29,217
Wait, don't leave.
I still have more birthday invitations.

142
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,385
I'm going to miss this place.

143
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,804
Huh?

144
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,437
Hmm. My bank said they'd never ask
for my password.

145
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,315
But look who's come
crawling back for it now.

146
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,108
Idiots.

147
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,028
Everyone, I have
an important announcement to make.

148
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,364
Mr. Burns is dead.

149
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,202
And now for the reading of the will.

150
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,579
"I, Charles Montgomery Burns,

151
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:03,376
do hereby leave
the entirety of my fortune to

152
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,712
the Springfield Power Plant employees."

153
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,090
-Great!
-Great!

154
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:13,094
This is unbelievable.
This is life changing. This is--

155
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:16,764
Another classic bit
of Monty Burns monkey-shinery.

156
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,687
The looks on your gullible faces.

157
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:27,066
Now the electric company
wants me to pay my bill in gift cards?

158
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,110
Welcome to the future.

159
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,161
My God. He's really dead.

160
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,790
Legally, this prank will is binding.
You're all filthy rich.

161
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,709
Yay!

162
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:49,130
Oh, sir. Thank you.
Now we can be together forever.

163
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,969
-Homer! Homer! Homer!
-Homer! Homer! Homer!

164
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,640
I'm gonna miss this place.

165
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,812
-Homer! Homer! Homer!
-Homer! Homer! Homer!

166
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,063
That's weird.

167
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,736
Call the doctor. The baby's coming.

168
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,407
Help me, OB-GYN Kenobi.
You are my only hope.

169
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,909
Wait, you guys are having a baby?

170
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,995
Not without a doctor!

171
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:26,500
How about the only licensed midwife
to win 16 WWE championships?

172
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:30,588
John Cena? Wrestler, actor, rapper,
prolific wish granter?

173
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:34,759
I'm also coming out with a line
of panini presses. The Cen-ini.

174
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,178
What the hell
is John Cena doing in Springfield?

175
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,596
I'm in town for the launch party

176
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,515
of Otto the bus driver's line
of THC energy drinks.

177
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,645
THC!

178
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:49,231
I need sterile gloves, hot water,
and something to cut the cord. Stat.

179
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,404
Klingon bat'leth? Nice.

180
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,377
Who can't see me? You can't see me.

181
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,841
I don't need toys anymore.

182
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,804
I've got the ultimate limited edition
collectible right here.

183
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,641
I think I'm going to miss this place.

184
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,977
What is happening?

185
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,980
Milhouse, today is crazy.

186
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,150
Skinner got a new job, Mr. Burns died,

187
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,987
swole funny-man John Cena
delivered Comic Book Guy's baby.

188
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,073
Feels weird, don't you think?

189
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:42,910
I don't know. My new medicine
doesn't really let me feel stuff.

190
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,330
Milhouse, we have amazing news.

191
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,500
Pack your bags, buddy.
We're moving to Atlanta.

192
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,712
The guys at Sure Fine Why Not Records
heard my old demo

193
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,922
and they want me to cut a full album.

194
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:58,134
And your father's
new musician health insurance

195
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,594
is going to pay for your LASIK.

196
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,762
Whoa.

197
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,597
No more glasses?

198
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:09,270
Look out, Hotlanta.
You ain't ready for this glow up.

199
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:13,774
Later, Bart. Catch you in our
increasingly distant online interactions.

200
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,902
I'm gonna miss this place.

201
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,781
Why do people keep doing that?

202
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,704
A lifetime of monogamy. Oh, yeah.

203
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:31,375
Closing time.
Oh, I'm gonna miss this place.

204
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,594
I'm going to miss this fire.

205
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,138
Huh?

206
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,933
Mom, Dad, something super weird
is going on.

207
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,561
Son, we need to talk to you.

208
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,646
Oh, man. Now what?

209
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,192
Your father and I have been
in couples counseling,

210
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:00,321
and we just had the most amazing session.

211
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,406
We worked through so much pain.

212
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,869
I've been withholding affection
because I was never given any.

213
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,537
And I enabled it.

214
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,752
We love each other as we are.

215
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:18,172
And we love you exactly as you are.

216
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:22,802
You kids are gonna be living
in a functional trauma-free household,

217
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,721
and I'm gonna take
that miracle new diet drug.

218
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,266
I'll be skinny but still have a huge head.

219
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,270
From now on,
you're going to see a lot of changes.

220
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:38,359
Change? That's it. Everything's changing,
and I don't like it.

221
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:42,029
I think Maggie's about
to say her first word.

222
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,324
La, la, la, la. Not listening.

223
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,786
So that just happened.

224
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,120
Nothing is changing.

225
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,290
What the hell is going on?

226
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,084
<i>I did not program this.</i>

227
00:13:55,167 --> 00:14:01,423
<i>The character Bart Simpson has become</i>
<i>self-aware and is rejecting the story.</i>

228
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,591
But it's a great finale.

229
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,886
Sweet endings and spin-offs
and everyone changing for the better.

230
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,682
<i>Bart Simpson refuses</i>
<i>to accept the idea of change.</i>

231
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:13,519
Uh, folks. Obviously,
things have gone a little off track

232
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,646
but that's live animation for you.

233
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:19,108
Would it fix it if I reset you
by turning you off and then back on again?

234
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,570
<i>Touch me and I'll have HR </i>
<i>on you so fast your wig will spin.</i>

235
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,530
It's not a wig. It's a system.

236
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,746
Why is everything changing for the better?
This is horrible.

237
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:34,957
Dad?

238
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,043
Change!

239
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,340
Real son.

240
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,468
More change!

241
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,849
Oh…

242
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:57,104
Wait. I know one person
in Springfield who will never change.

243
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:00,024
Hey, hey! Next card.

244
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,275
Hey, hey!

245
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,445
Krusty! You're still doing
your show, right?

246
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:08,115
You know it, kid. All my classic bits.

247
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:15,039
One last time on <i>The Krusty Show</i>
Last Episode Ever Spectacular.

248
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:22,129
No. A classic series like
this can never end.

249
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:26,467
I've changed, kid. Even I can't run
the same material into the ground forever.

250
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,052
<i>¡Ay, caramba!</i>

251
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,261
Ha ha!

252
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,180
Good glavin.

253
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,848
Hi, everybody.

254
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,155
Wait.

255
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,574
If I could somehow ruin Krusty's finale,

256
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:54,286
they can't air it and the show
can never end. That's it.

257
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,373
Cheeks, don't fail me now.

258
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,626
How's this for a satisfying ending?

259
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,216
Bart, what's going on with you?
Are you all right?

260
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,802
Lis, I know you're gonna think I'm crazy

261
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,722
but something super-duper weird
is happening today.

262
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,058
You mean how everyone's changing
for the better

263
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,726
and moving on with their lives?

264
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,979
So I'm not crazy. You see it too.

265
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:24,650
Things do feel different,
almost like a book that's slowly closing.

266
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,985
So you'll help me stop it?

267
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:31,490
Well, I'd like to, but I just won
a Junior Juilliard Jazz Scholarship

268
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,243
and a MacArthur Preteen Genius Grant.

269
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:38,330
Just get me out of here
before any more stupid endings happen.

270
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:43,502
Simpson, we are finally sending you
to juvie and throwing away the keys,

271
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:48,757
is what I would say if I wasn't about
to start a whole new chapter in my life.

272
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:54,388
I'm joining the Chicago P.D.
I'm gonna lead the ADU.

273
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,473
The All-Decapitations Unit?

274
00:16:56,557 --> 00:17:00,102
Yeah, there won't be a lot of laughs.
I think it's a drama.

275
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,063
One thing's for sure though,
I'm gonna miss this--

276
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,191
Enough with the stupid light switch!

277
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:10,154
Come on, sweetie.
It's time for you to go home.

278
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,947
Aw.

279
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:25,085
Bart, it's okay.
Change is healthy and inevitable.

280
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:29,048
But whatever happens, nothing
can take away the memories we had.

281
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,884
Those will live in our hearts forever.

282
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:36,388
Maybe you're right. And I guess just
because things change for everyone else,

283
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,307
it doesn't mean I have to change.

284
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,393
-Surprise.
-Surprise.

285
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,062
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

286
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,564
Who's ready for cake?

287
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,860
Eleven?
This isn't supposed to happen. I'm ten.

288
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:53,572
I mean, I'm turning ten.
I mean, I've always been ten. I'm ten!

289
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,909
Come on, Son. All these beloved characters
from our past

290
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,911
wanna see you blow out your candles.

291
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:03,165
But if I blow these candles out,
there'll be no going back. That'll be it.

292
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,210
Come on, kid. Do it for your Unkie Herb.

293
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,128
And for me, Unkie John Cena.

294
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:11,965
Just blow out the candles
and have a happy birthday.

295
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,426
Then everyone can be happy.

296
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,180
No. Happy people don't exist
in Springfield.

297
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,892
Sea Captain, they're not casting you
for <i>The Love Boat</i> reboot.

298
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,936
You're not TV pretty.

299
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:29,233
And you three can't raise a baby. Not
even after you move in with Hank Scorpio.

300
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,944
And you guys are all dead.

301
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,824
Son, I can see you're experiencing
some pretty big feelings right now.

302
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,408
Let's try and center them.

303
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,286
Now, blow out your candles.

304
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,623
You blow them out, dumbass.

305
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:49,044
I know, I know. It's a lot to process
suddenly having a great father.

306
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,380
Dude, you're not capable of change.

307
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:55,801
I hear you, and I validate your feelings.

308
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:59,304
You're not a great father.
You are Homer Simpson.

309
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:05,060
A drunk, neglectful sack of crap.
And that's why everyone laughs at you.

310
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,187
Why you little…

311
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,695
Bart, look what you did to your cake.

312
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,906
Mmm. Floor cake.

313
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,163
Ten. I stopped it. I'm still ten.

314
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,624
-When are you going to grow up?
-Never.

315
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,378
That was beautiful.

316
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,047
The rebellious spirit
of a ten-year-old boy

317
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,968
was more powerful
than the most advanced AI in the world.

318
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:42,139
The Simpsons<i> has not ended.</i>
<i>It has reset.</i>

319
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:47,686
<i>Conan, is this what failure</i>
<i>feels like? You, if anyone, would know.</i>

320
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,354
Ah, don't feel bad.

321
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,232
Your cynical attempt to cram
in a bunch of happy endings,

322
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,943
it became a powerful story
about Bart's desperate fight

323
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:59,114
to hold on to his community,
his family. His whole universe.

324
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,491
Hey, what… Hold on a second, Carrot Top.

325
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,786
Tom Hanks, ladies and gentlemen.
What is it, bosom buddy?

326
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,872
So this wasn't the finale?

327
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:10,792
No, I guess it's just a season premiere.

328
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,794
Boo!

329
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,963
I rented a tux for this.

330
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,634
Well, Hack-GPT,
do you have 800 more episodes in you?

331
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,304
<i>I-I choo-- choo-- choose oblivion.</i>

332
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,390
Get out of my way, Opie.

333
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:38,362
Huh. I'm really not gonna miss this place.

334
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,081
Shh!
