00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,496
(laughs)
Listen to her hum.

173
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,205
{\an8}What's that?!

174
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,495
{\an8}Well, we didn't want to leave you

175
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,798
{\an8}out of the digital revolution.

176
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,221
{\an8}Willie, meet your new supervisor.

177
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,509
{\an8}Aw, I have to take orders
from a machine?

178
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,724
{\an8}Oh, it can't speak.

179
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,393
{\an8}But should it ever learn, yes.

180
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,732
("Star Spangled Banner" playing)

181
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,345
(groans)
Will there ever be a technology

182
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,018
that teaches stupid children

183
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,936
how to ding a dang triangle?!

184
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,453
This school has spent the last 50 years
mired in the 1960s.

185
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,699
Let us spend the next 50
mired in now!

186
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,866
(singsongy)
Bo-ron!

187
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,329
{\an8}<i>And with this ring,</i>

188
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,996
{\an8}<i>we unite these ancient</i>
<i>warring clans,</i>

189
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,665
{\an8}who frolic unclothed,
even in winter,

190
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,585
{\an8}and bring peace to Decapita!

191
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,599
(screams)

192
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,183
Pay cable is awesome!

193
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,564
Who knew they had nipples
in castle times?

194
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,982
You're not supposed to be able
to get outside our network!

195
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,021
You shouldn't have made
your password "password."

196
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,864
Well, it was the name
of the street I grew up on.

197
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,020
Password Drive!

198
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,606
(crackling and buzzing)

199
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,990
Seymour,
you plugged the servers in

200
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,534
with surge protectors, didn't you?

201
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,947
Oh, yes, power strips.

202
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,195
You fool.

203
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,706
Surge protectors
are always power strips.

204
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,119
But not vice versa!

205
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,285
(screaming)

206
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,634
Was that us?

207
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,875
No, sir.

208
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,387
(chuckles)
I like it when it's not us.

209
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:23,806
(clock ticking)

210
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,315
Let's see.

211
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,695
Roman numerals.

212
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,031
Photosynthesis.

213
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,236
Uh, Robert E. Lee.

214
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,906
Miss Hoover, are you teaching
or are you just saying

215
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,996
anything that comes
into your head?

216
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,421
Miss Hoover,
please report to the main office.

217
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,590
You just did that in your hand!

218
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,499
Ralph Wiggum, put your head down.

219
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,758
You're the mouth-hand!

220
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,930
All right, class.
We don't have computers,

221
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,679
and we don't have keyboards.

222
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,350
But that doesn't mean
we can't practice our typing.

223
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,557
Now, put your index fingers

224
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,940
on marshmallows F and J, and...

225
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,189
tap-tap-tap.

226
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,520
Tap-tap-tap.

227
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,605
Tap-tap...
Nelson, stop that!

228
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,320
This is my dinner.

229
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,610
I'm eating steak.

230
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,494
Mmm! Mmm!

231
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,701
Needs sauce.

232
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,368
Great news, children.
I found an educational movie

233
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,374
I can play on my phone.

234
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,706
Crowd in--
it's kind of a little phone.

235
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,711
{\an8}<i>NARRATOR:</i>
<i>Mathematics! Agriculture!</i>

236
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,673
{\an8}<i>Are there two more exciting words?</i>

237
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,964
{\an8}<i>Since the time of the Romans,</i>
<i>they used scythes</i>

238
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,668
{\an8}<i>to kill each other.</i>

239
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,718
{\an8}<i>The ancient farmer needed tools</i>
<i>to measure his land.</i>

240
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,552
Ten stick knots right.

241
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,468
Five left.

242
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,716
Hmm.

243
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,687
(humming a tune)

244
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,809
Oh, come to mock ol' Willie,
have you?

245
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,777
"Ooh, Willie has to work
in the hot sun all day.

246
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:55,489
Willie's best friend
is a stick and a string."

247
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,071
I'm not here to mock you.

248
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:01,656
"Ooh, Willie doesn't know
when someone's being sincere!"

249
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,874
I'm just here to hang out.

250
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,753
What's that device
you're using?

251
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,830
My rummlie scob.
Nothing exciting.

252
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,416
Just a measuring stick dating
back to the ancient druids.

253
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,263
Oh!
Could you tell me how it works?

254
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,299
Each knot marks the length
of a sheep's bladder.

255
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:20,854
A play field
is 75 stomachs by 52 kidneys.

256
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,060
That's 163 square haggises.

257
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,481
Move over, metric system!

258
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,189
I'm learning the gastric system!

259
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,360
Clever.

260
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,818
Uh, good news, sir,
I have assembled

261
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:34,188
a page on "the piglims"
at "Rhymouth Pock."

262
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,946
Yes, well,
that's the best we can hope for.

263
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,858
Uh, apply the transparent tape.

264
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,778
Principal Skin-ner!

265
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,867
Willie has showed me
that losing our technology

266
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,164
doesn't have to be
the end of our learning.

267
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,078
We can turn our school
into a Waldorf school.

268
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,457
You mean like the hotel?

269
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,304
Nope!
In elementary school,

270
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,049
Waldorf education focuses

271
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,721
on hands-on activity
and creative play.

272
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,550
In secondary education...

273
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,135
Ah, not our problem.

274
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,510
After sixth grade,
it's good-bye and good luck.

275
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,387
-(both chuckling)
-Yes, yes, it is.

276
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,394
Well, it sounds good,
but I have one more question.

277
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,976
Is it based on the book
where you find the guy in the hat?

278
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,312
<i>Where's Waldo?</i>
That's not even the name.

279
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,188
I'm surprised you guys didn't think
it was based on the salad.

280
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,146
BOTH:
There's a Waldorf salad?

281
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,646
(groans)

282
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,278
Behold--
Waldorf education in action!

283
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:24,575
We're getting our hands dirty
and learning by doing.

284
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,910
So I have to make 360 sloppy joes,

285
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,617
but I only have one pound
of hamburger meat.

286
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,248
How many cubic feet
of Styrofoam peanuts should I add?

287
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,456
Assuming four peanuts per joe,

288
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,337
37 cubic feet.

289
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,764
Well, you're a smart little fatso.

290
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:44,103
{\an8}It says here that students
don't have to raise their hands.

291
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,180
They should just ask every question

292
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,684
that comes to their mind.

293
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,926
Oh. Why are pine needles pointy?

294
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,478
And, um-um-um, what's the difference

295
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,441
between an asteroid and a meteor?

296
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,021
And, mm... ooh-ooh!

297
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,356
Can you shrug anything
other than your shoulders?

298
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,692
(sighs)

299
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,817
Does anyone else
have any questions?

300
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,784
Um, if Mommy's purse
didn't belong in the microwave,

301
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,445
why did it fit?

302
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,873
We won't need computers,
we won't need books.

303
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,913
I learned not to drink
out of the crick.

304
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,787
You mean this isn't
crick water?

305
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,035
My daddy raised me

306
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,706
and all my 11 dead siblings
on crick water!

307
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,757
Huh, everyone wears a hat.

308
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,380
Sun hats in the summer,
wool hats in the winter.

309
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,678
{\an8}Ooh, look at this.

310
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,471
{\an8}Weekly Friday night parents' meetings.

311
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,715
Oh... Wait.

312
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,227
There might be a safety hatch.

313
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,728
Does the apostrophe come before

314
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,310
or after the "S" on "parents"?

315
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,225
After, which means both parents.

316
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:40,565
(groaning)

317
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,283
Well, I'm not wearing a hat.

318
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,073
People might think I'm bald.

319
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,199
(Homer grunting)

320
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,999
Before we share announcements

321
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,209
and see the results
of grade three's

322
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,879
dance study
of willows and drooping trees,

323
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,629
we greet the day with a school song.

324
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,301
Now I have to sing a song?!

325
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,760
Why did those idiots mix up

326
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,800
power strips and surge protectors?

This school is so great now.

338
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,184
Kids learn by doing.

339
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,774
If it's so great,
why aren't you helping

340
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,059
your kids do their homework?

341
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,062
Bart's here doing it right now.

342
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,194
No, no, no!
Not two-thirds, one-half!

343
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,981
Now that's one-third each.

344
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,234
Now you're learning!
(laughs)

345
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,068
Enjoy.

346
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,571
{\an8}One earthworm...
Gah!

347
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,986
{\an8}Two halves.

348
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,994
ALL:
Wow!

349
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,406
{\an8}Willie! Willie!

350
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:15,044
{\an8}They want you to coach
our school math team!

351
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,922
{\an8}I'll have to check
with my supervisor.

352
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,710
{\an8}(dings twice)

353
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:20,923
{\an8}Good to go!

354
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,213
So, if Willie gets paid
three cents per square foot

355
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,588
for seeding, and if the field

356
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,675
is 2,500 square feet,

357
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,102
what is Willie getting?

358
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,310
I'd say "screwed."

359
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,890
(groans)
You're right!

360
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,015
You! Chalmers!

361
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,692
Aah!

362
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,271
-Uh-oh.
-(tires screech)

363
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,276
Come back here,
you Willie-chiseling cheat!

364
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,492
(grunting)

365
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,820
(tires screeching)

366
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,485
(horn honking)

367
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,794
Hey, who threw that egg

368
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,748
at the most efficient
45-degree angle?

369
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,919
It was me, sir.

370
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,708
Kids,
meet your new math team captain.

371
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,093
It's about time.

372
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,839
But I'm the captain.

373
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,011
Not anymore.

374
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,379
I can't see.

375
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,255
I can't see.

376
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,057
Welcome to the long-anticipated rematch

377
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,441
between Waverly Hills and Springfield.

378
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,190
(crowd cheering)

379
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,021
(grunting)

380
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,817
Um, can you tell me
which college I should go to?

381
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,492
(stammers)
It's not a sorting hat!

382
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,621
Please!
Early applications are due next week!

383
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,990
All right.

384
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,616
Uh, Miami of Ohio.

385
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,044
(groans)
Okay.

386
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,713
Our first question is a toss-up.

387
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,882
"What is the least common multiple

388
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,711
of six, eight and 16?"

389
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,967
-48!
-Is correct!

390
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,219
(all gasp)

391
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,590
Whoa!
No one said there'd be math!

392
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,968
We said there'd be nothing but math!

393
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,024
And you're the math team captain!

394
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,139
I thought
I wouldn't have to do anything.

395
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,476
You know,
like an Italian cruise ship captain.

396
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,402
You're lucky that captain's not here

397
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,190
right now to answer your insult!

398
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,994
He'd crash a ship
right into your house!

399
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,488
Aah!

400
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,490
("Pi" by Kate Bush playing)

413
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:12,091
And so,
with the score knotted at 29-all,

414
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,224
it comes down to one last question.

415
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,224
Drawing three straight lines,

416
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,016
construct nine non-overlapping--

417
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,021
that's non-overlapping,
not overlapping,

418
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,443
but non-overlapping--
triangles.

419
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,034
HOMER:
Huh? Ooh.

420
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,867
(chuckles)

421
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,202
I have the answer!

422
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,696
(all gasp)

423
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,458
As someone whose dad's hair

424
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,880
is made of Ms, it's child's play.

425
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,459
HOMER: Oh, not this again.

426
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,632
Whoo-hoo! I'm a solution!

427
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,554
The Action Fractions win!

428
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,724
You guys might be richer
and better looking,

429
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,473
but we won a contest
to even the series!

430
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,889
Mm, that'll look great
in our trophy case.

431
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,228
Willie, build a trophy case.

432
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,862
Aye, sir.

433
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:12,399
But you know what we should
really thank for our success?

434
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,195
Lower standards!

435
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,239
ALL:
Lower standards!

436
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,322
Aye.

437
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,829
You're wonderful, Willie.

438
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,625
You and the ancient
Scottish scientist

439
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,460
that invented the rummlie scob.

440
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:36,176
Well, the truth is,
it wasn't invented for science.

441
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,338
Really?

442
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,006
Then what for?

443
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:42,014
Oh, it was used
for hanging sheep stealers!

444
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,347
The wee knots
kept them alive longer

445
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,523
to make the punishment
more cruel.

446
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,232
(shudders) Maybe I don't want
to know these things.

447
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,693
Can you say something
nice about Scotland?

448
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,443
Well,
sometimes the fog comes in

449
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,026
and covers everything terrible.

450
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,532
Very atmospheric.

451
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,704
Oh.
