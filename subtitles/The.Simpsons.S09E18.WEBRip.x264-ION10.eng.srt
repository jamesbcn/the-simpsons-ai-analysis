00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,105
D'oh! (screams)

10
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,281
(tires screeching)

11
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:26,634
{\an8}Now, whose calculator can tell me what
seven times eight is?

12
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,673
{\an8}Oh! Oh! Oh! Low battery?

13
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,757
{\an8}(groans) Whatever.

14
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,974
{\an8}Attention, children.

15
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,061
{\an8}Uh, over here.

16
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,889
{\an8}Oh, for the love of-- The doorway.

17
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:45,016
{\an8}-KIDS: Oh!
-We have a very special visitor today.

18
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,725
{\an8}But he's no ordinary visitor.
In fact, uh, you might say--

19
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:52,527
{\an8}-He's a robot. We saw him on the way in.
-Thank you, Bart.

20
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,452
{\an8}All right. Come in. They know.

21
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:59,075
{\an8}Kids, this is Robby the Automaton.

22
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,000
{\an8}Greetings, Earth children.

23
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,290
{\an8}Where are you from?

24
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,212
{\an8}Earth.

25
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,421
{\an8}Anyway, have you ever wondered

26
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,002
{\an8}what it feels like to touch a star?

27
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,798
{\an8}-(screams)
-Cool!

28
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:20,516
{\an8}Or which of the Three Stooges
had the heaviest brain?

29
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,023
{\an8}Hmm. Larry-- Three point two kilograms.

30
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,233
Fascinating!

31
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,273
{\an8}Ah.

32
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:31,066
{\an8}The answers to these and similar questions

33
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,821
{\an8}can be found at
the Springfield Knowledgeum...

34
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,414
{\an8}a hands-on learning environment...

35
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,869
opening this Saturday.

36
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,662
-No, kid! Don't!
-(grunts)

37
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:46,415
{\an8}-(screams)
-ROBBY: Command link severed.

38
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:51,169
{\an8}Default setting. Crush. Kill. Destroy.

39
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,554
{\an8}(gasping) D- Don't!

40
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:56,591
{\an8}Children, help! He's killing me!

41
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,636
(cheering)

42
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,641
What a whimsical building.

43
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,515
Who says science can't be fun?

44
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,772
Me. I smell a museum.

45
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,404
Yeah, good things don't end with "eum."

46
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,821
They end with "mania" or "teria."

47
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,196
{\an8}Will there be beer?

48
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,031
(over speakers) <i>Welcome to</i>
<i>the Knowledgeum. I'm Troy McClure.</i>

49
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,197
{\an8}<i>You may remember me from such automated</i>
<i>information kiosks</i>

50
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,497
{\an8}<i>as "Welcome to Springfield Airport"</i>
<i>and "Where's Nordstrom?"</i>

51
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,962
{\an8}<i>While you're enjoying</i>

52
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,053
<i>your car will, unfortunately,</i>

53
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,509
What'd he say? What about my car?

54
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,509
ALL: Wow!

55
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,508
KIDS: (shouting) (grunting)

56
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,310
(shouting)

57
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:50,102
{\an8}It says the ceiling was donated
by the Velcro company.

58
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,268
(gasping)

59
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:57,242
{\an8}And the floor was donated
by American SuperBall.

60
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,570
Hey, I'm gonna go toss the Virtual Salad.

61
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,316
I want to read the Giant Book.

62
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,867
I'm gonna try the Sex
Education Computer. (gasps)

63
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,123
Come on, Maggie.

64
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,334
Let's try and find the Enormous Pendulum.

65
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,424
Whoa! Wait there!

66
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:16,593
(clears throat) The section now
illuminated is the floating point unit...

67
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,843
one of my personal favorite units.

68
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,465
-Oh, I see!
-(exclaiming)

69
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,972
Oh. Well. (chuckles)

70
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,715
How do you get this thing
to play blackjack?

71
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,017
Stop that. You're hurting it.

72
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,430
{\an8}-So how's it supposed to work?
-Well--

73
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,765
{\an8}-Boring! Am I on the Internet?
-No, you can only access the--

74
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,274
{\an8}Boring! What's that fire for?

75
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,147
{\an8}The hard drive is crashing
at an alarming speed!

76
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,565
{\an8}No more pictures!

77
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,529
(grunting)

78
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,447
Ovulate, damn you. Ovulate!

79
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,867
(woman's voice) <i>You are out of sperm.</i>

80
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,166
(whimpers)

81
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,920
Hey, baby. Remember me?

82
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,218
Whoa! This whole planet
is like one big skate park!

83
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,858
{\an8}Look out, Ralph! (screams) (grunts)

84
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,404
I found a moon rock in my nose.

85
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,193
(imitates static)
Houston, we have a booger.

86
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,778
Hey, loser, this planet's for space studs.

87
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,775
Yeah, blast off.

88
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,157
I know you. My daddy took your beer.

89
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,754
Whoa! The baby can talk.

90
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,620
I am not a baby.

91
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,338
-Tell it to The Ear, baby.
-(muffled talking)

92
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,629
(chuckling) Good one, guys.

93
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:43,183
{\an8}-Simpson, go kiss the Virtual Ass.
-Yes, sir.

94
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,719
(whimpers, grunts)

95
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:49,313
-You poor little boy!
-Ah, no. He'll be fine.

96
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,560
He's always gettin' himself
stuffed into this or that.

97
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:56,153
(yipping, roaring)

98
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:02,735
-Is that normal?
-Yeah, he's just playing Wiggle Puppy.

99
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,280
That's a dog he made up
who flies by waggin' his tail.

100
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:10,036
I tell you, that dog has had
some amazing adventures.

101
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:14,369
Well, Ralph certainly has
a lot of imagination.

102
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,127
Ah, yeah, the kid's incredible.

103
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,049
I mean, the special schools
are all over him.

104
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:22,298
Maybe he needs some real friends.

105
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,132
Sure, we'd all love
some real friends, Marge...

106
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,008
but what are the odds of that happening?

107
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,720
-(panting)
-Hello, Ralph.

108
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,766
When I was little,
I used to play by myself too.

109
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,850
Your hair is tall and pretty.

110
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:40,107
Well, thank you, Ralph.
You're such a fine, young gentleman.

111
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,356
Help! She's touching my special area!

112
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,614
Then me and my friend
were about to press it,

113
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,236
but the man said not to press it.

114
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,703
But we pressed it anyway!
And we ran and we hid in the Giant Tire.

115
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,865
Oh, yeah. And my other friend
was already there.

116
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,874
All right. All right now.
You're overstimulated.

117
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,037
Let's get some beer in you,
and then it's right to bed.

118
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,337
Whoo-hoo! Beer, beer, beer! Bed, bed, bed!

119
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:07,971
Firecrackers, stink bombs,
maps to teachers' homes.

120
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,562
-You know who's nice?
-No. Who?

121
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,309
That Ralph Wiggum boy.

122
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,601
{\an8}-He's a real winner.
-You would know.

123
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,055
Bart, you don't have to go anywhere today.

124
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,106
I've got a surprise for you.

125
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,319
{\an8}-What?
-I scheduled a playdate.

126
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,320
(doorbell rings)

127
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,698
A what? With who?

128
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,954
-(gasps)
-Hi, Bart. We're gonna be friends.

129
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,332
I have a finger trap.

130
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,705
{\an8}Whoa. Get him off. Get him off!

131
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,118
{\an8}Fighting only makes it tighter.

132
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,040
(grunting)

133
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,048
{\an8}You want me to hang out with Ralph Wiggum?

134
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,220
{\an8}-Not hang out. Playdate!
-Stop saying that!

135
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,010
Now, why don't you show off
your new friend around the neighborhood?

136
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,764
You two make an adorable pair.

137
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,217
{\an8}Someone will be right with you.

138
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,808
{\an8}Mom, school has changed a lot
since you were a kid.

139
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,984
{\an8}Popularity is very important now.

140
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,652
-But--
-Don't talk. Listen.

141
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,611
{\an8}The social order of elementary
school is densely layered.

142
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,242
{\an8}The coolest kids are at the top--

143
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,149
Oh, you mean like the "A" students?

144
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,279
{\an8}Mom, I don't want to play with Ralph.

145
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:15,495
He's just a misunderstood
little boy who needs a friend.

146
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,368
And if he hangs around with you...

147
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,576
well, everyone will think he's cool.

148
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,126
{\an8}Well, I don't know about that.

149
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,381
{\an8}-Might help him a little.
-OK! Great!

150
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:29,093
-You kids have fun.
-Hey, wait! I didn't agree to-

151
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,835
(humming)

152
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,887
-(humming continues)
-Mom, I am not--

153
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,060
MARGE: I can't hear you! (humming)

154
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,850
(electronic whirring)

155
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,651
Your toys are fun to touch.
Mine are all sticky.

156
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,192
Ralph, I just got through sorting those.

157
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:50,276
I dropped my "Popsticle"
in your toy chest.

158
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:56,237
-Ralph, would you just--
-Look! A rocket ship!

159
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,327
That's not a toy!

160
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:02,332
Hey! Do you know how
to play hide-and-seek?

161
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,550
(gasps)

162
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,458
Shh! I been here two hours,

163
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,797
and Bart still hasn't finded me.

164
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,007
{\an8}These syrup stains are the worst.

165
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,104
{\an8}Bart, it's too nice a day
to leave Ralph in a closet.

166
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,140
{\an8}You boys should go play outside.

167
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,984
{\an8}But people will see me
paired up with a doofus.

168
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,100
You have no idea what that's like.

169
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,228
{\an8}-Uh-oh.
-I'm going.

170
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,610
Slow down, Bart. My legs don't know
how to be as long as yours.

171
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,158
Well, that is your problem, Ralph.

172
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,031
This is how I always walk.

173
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,408
KIDS: (shouting) All right!

174
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,785
{\an8}-Whoa!
-Check this out!

175
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,792
{\an8}-Yeah!
-All right!

176
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:48,254
Videotaping this crime spree
is the best idea we ever had!

177
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,257
-Quick, Ralph. In the bushes.
-(grunts)

178
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,049
Whoo!

179
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,933
-Hi, guys. Hot enough for you?
-Shut up.

180
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,181
{\an8}(shouting)

181
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,433
(sighs) That was too close.

182
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,095
We gotta stay off the streets.

183
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,773
Bushes are nice 'cause
they don't have prickers.

184
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,863
Unless they do. This one did. Ouch.

185
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:10,109
This is my swing set. This is my sandbox.

186
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,822
I'm not allowed to go in the deep end.

187
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,743
That's where I saw the leprechaun.

188
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,202
Right. A leprechaun.

189
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,123
He told me to burn things.

190
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,122
Uh-huh.

191
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,633
-Wanna play stuffed animal parade?
-Maybe later.

192
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,750
Come on, Ralph. Your dad's a cop.

193
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,337
There must be some cool stuff around here-

194
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,592
bullets, dead body photos, what have you.

195
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,724
He keeps that stuff in his closet,

196
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,801
but he says I'm not allowed in there.

197
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,637
-Did he say <i>I'm </i>not allowed in there?
-Yes.

198
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,684
Well, I'm goin' in anyway.

199
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,768
(grunts)

200
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:53,034
Oh, Lord, I thank you for this bounty
I'm about to receive.

201
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,570
Hmm.

202
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,370
(shuddering) Huh!

203
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,500
Wow! Dad's been in jail six times!

204
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,209
Aw, Mom's only been in twice.

205
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,840
-(door opens)
-Hello! Sarah! Ralphie!

206
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,589
-It's me, Chief Wiggum!
-Oh. We better hide.

207
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,343
-(grunting)
-(gasping)

208
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,715
Quick! In here!

209
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:23,314
(sighs) Oh! Man, we have got
to get an escalator.

210
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,397
(gasps) A 341 in my own bedroom.

211
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,979
All right, crookie. Let's dance.

212
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,820
(grunts) Oh! God, my back!

213
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:38,452
Oh! Officer down! Officer down!

214
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,571
-(grunting)
-Hi, Daddy.

215
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,988
Oh, oh. It's just you.
Well, help Daddy up.

216
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,038
(grunts)

217
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,372
You know you're not
supposed to go in there.

218
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:52,287
What is your fascination with
my forbidden closet of mystery?

219
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,298
{\an8}Sorry, Chief. Um, we were just playing.

220
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,261
Ralphie, you got a friend?

221
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,643
Hey, that's fantastic!

222
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,890
Here, here. Have some riot gear.

223
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,721
It's on the house.

224
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,307
(both grunting)

225
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,313
(laughing)

226
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,645
Ah, that takes me back to the '60s.

227
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,319
What's that weird key for?

228
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,323
That's Daddy's magic key.

229
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,485
It opens every door in town.

230
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,542
{\an8}The police master key?

231
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,409
{\an8}Oh, Ralph.

232
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,580
{\an8}Do you realize what we can do with--

233
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,206
{\an8}(smacking, gulping) Get me a towel.

234
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:40,425
"Hi. This is Jerry Maguire.
Show me the message.

235
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,639
Show me the message!"

236
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,720
No, that stinks. Let me try one.

237
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:49,226
"This is Geraldine, and the devil made me
miss your call...

238
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,270
so here come the beep.

239
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,023
Here come the beep!" (chuckling)

240
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,976
"Do the message!" (humming)

241
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,567
{\an8}So long. I'm gonna sleep over
at Ralph's.

242
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,703
Oh! See, I knew you'd find
something you liked about him.

243
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,032
Oh, I found something, all right.

244
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,237
(moans)

245
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,957
(humming continues)

246
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,915
-After the beep.
-(beeps)

247
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,050
Uh, Ralph's a little afraid
of the dark, Bart.

248
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,881
-Is it OK to sleep with a night-light?
-Absolutely.

249
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,508
Good night, guys.

250
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,965
-I'm scared.
-Ow!

251
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,808
MAN (on TV): <i>We now return to</i>

252
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,975
The Return of the Pink Panther Returns...

253
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,444
<i>starring Ken Wahl as Inspector Clouseau.</i>

254
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,322
(snores) Ow.

255
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,583
-Ow.
-RALPH: (whimpers)

256
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,909
(snoring)

257
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,075
Ooh.

258
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,174
Son of a-- (snoring)

259
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,225
The world is our toy store.

260
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,598
Toy store, toy store, toy store! Whee!

261
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,306
Oh, to be eight again.

262
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:19,066
Whee!

263
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,239
-Whoa! Whoa!
-Whee! Whee!

264
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:33,367
(laughing) Whoa! (both grunt)

265
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,630
Ah, I can't believe
we ate a whole wedding cake.

266
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,011
And an entire pan of funeral fudge.

267
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,672
(gasps)

268
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,553
Check it out, guys. It's dork and dorker.

269
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,926
What you doin' there, Simpson,
babysittin'?

270
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,845
We're on a playdate.

271
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,393
-(laughing)
-Isn't that adorable?

272
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,767
Ah, the girls are on a playdate!

273
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,855
Uh, I'll take it from here, Ralph.

274
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,901
Um, we're just hangin',
chillin', little bit of illin'.

275
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,816
I don't get you, Simpson.

276
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,735
Sometimes you seem kind of righteous,

277
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,623
but then we see you
fraternizing with lameoids.

278
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,791
Which makes you a lame wad!

279
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,870
Oh, yeah? Would a lame wad
have the police master key?

280
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:20,377
-Whoa! Useful, dude!
-Very handy!

281
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,921
{\an8}Hey, maybe you are cool enough
to hang out with us.

282
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,176
{\an8}Really? You think so?

283
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,508
{\an8}I don't know what to say.
This is all happening so fast.

284
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,425
Let's use this thing to rob the school.

285
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,893
Let's go to the zoo and tease the dingo.

286
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,194
Let's use it to key some cars.

287
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,728
{\an8}Those are all moderately cool ideas...

288
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,272
{\an8}but if you really want to
walk on the wild side...

289
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,277
I know just the place.

290
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,822
Here she is, the big house.

291
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,576
The stony lonesome.
The thug jug. The mobster trap.

292
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,120
-Penn State. The old crook--
-Shut up!

293
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,004
Let's just open the gate.

294
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:01,631
{\an8}-(dog howling)
-I'm scared, Bart. I wanna go home.

295
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,420
Come on, Ralph. Don't embarrass me.

296
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,505
It's just an abandoned prison.

297
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,590
All the murderers are long dead.

298
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,636
And I'm sure their ghosts
are probably in hell.

299
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,270
-(whimpering)
-Let's go, Simpson! Ditch the baby.

300
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,639
(whimpers, gasps)

301
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,516
(sniffling)

302
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,397
-My key!
-Sorry, Ralph.

303
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,567
I thought we were friends.

304
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,326
(laughing) Wait. I missed that.
Get him to say it again.

305
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,325
Go on home, Ralph.

306
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:46,257
(sobs) I can't, without
Daddy's key! (gasps)

307
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,425
{\an8}I can't bail on a friend,
even if it is Ralph.

308
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,639
-Ah, you wuss.
-Hey! Give it back!

309
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,813
-(grunts)
-Hey! Keep away!

310
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,436
Hey, come on! I thought we were friends.

311
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,441
Yeah, well, I hope the irony's
not lost on you, Simpson.

312
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,235
(grunts, groans)

313
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,608
(grunts)

314
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,566
(laughing)

315
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,736
This sucks. Let's do somethin' else.

316
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,575
I know. Let's go pick some huckleberries!

317
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,911
-Yeah!
-Huckleberries! All right!

318
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,327
Daddy's key went in there.

319
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,296
{\an8}Hey, Ralph, you're braver
than you thought.

320
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,708
{\an8}-(owl hooting)
-Wait for me!

321
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,724
(gasps)

322
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,557
Wow! Look at all these toilets.

323
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:44,192
And just inches from your bed.
Talk about luxury.

324
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,981
There's the key!

325
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,743
{\an8}-(squeaking)
-(gasps)

326
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,988
The pointy kitty took it!

327
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,325
Oh.

328
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,662
Danger, eh?

329
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,881
(key turning in lock)

330
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,958
-(door creaking)
-(both gasping)

331
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,008
Whoa, mama! The electric chair!

332
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:16,011
(sniffs) Smell that, Ralph?
That's the smell of justice.

333
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,595
Smells like hot dogs.

334
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,770
Hmm. Maybe it still works.

335
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,558
Give me the newlyweds from that cake.

336
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,057
Stand back.

337
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,898
(grunting, sighs) What a gyp.

338
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,402
Maybe our key fits in here.

339
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,985
(crackling)

340
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,492
(sinister chuckling)
Till death do you part.

341
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,408
-MAN: Somebody down there?
-(gasps) Uh-oh. Let's get outta here.

342
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,921
(panting)

343
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,801
Why do I always shout first?

344
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,219
Just gives them a chance to run away.

345
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,218
Well, I'm an idiot.

346
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,266
{\an8}-Got any threes?
-Go fish.

347
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,768
{\an8}Oh! See, here's the problem, Ralph.

348
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,101
{\an8}-You have several threes.
-Go fish!

349
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,441
{\an8}Why don't we watch cartoons?

350
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,323
The Justice League is moving
into their new building today.

351
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,861
<i>Kent Brockman reporting live</i>
<i>from Mayor Quimby's press conference...</i>

352
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,986
<i>at the abandoned penitentiary.</i>

353
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:18,993
Huh?

354
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,164
<i>I have ordered the reopening</i>
<i>of this prison</i>

355
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,203
<i>to send a message to</i>
<i>the criminals of Springfield.</i>

356
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,998
<i>If you commit</i>
<i>a violent crime in my town...</i>

357
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,792
<i>you are going to end up here.</i>

358
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,795
Hey, that's our play chair!

359
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,839
<i>To demonstrate what you're in for...</i>

360
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:37,182
<i>I will now strap myself</i>
<i>into this electric chair</i>

361
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,219
<i>which was deactivated over 30 years ago,</i>

362
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,434
<i>and, I can only assume, still is.</i>

363
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,765
Uh-oh. We didn't reset the safety switch.

364
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,522
He's gonna smell like hot dogs.

365
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,443
{\an8}(beeps)

366
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,612
{\an8}Operator, get me Morningwood Penitentiary.

367
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,151
{\an8}-It's an emergency.
-(busy tone)

368
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,315
{\an8}(groans)

369
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,283
Now, Martha, we've been
over this and over this.

370
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,664
We're too old to start having children.

371
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,992
If you're looking for something to do,

372
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,246
why don't you start a new twine ball?

373
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,289
Come on. A man's life is at stake.

374
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,962
We need to get a message to the prison.

375
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,752
Think. Think!

376
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,795
Lisa's a good thinker.

377
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,972
{\an8}That's it. Ralph, you're a genius!

378
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,390
<i>Now, as I mime the convulsions</i>
<i>of a condemned criminal,</i>

379
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,810
<i>I remind my staff</i>
<i>not to come to my assistance</i>

380
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,600
<i>no matter how realistic</i>
<i>my performance may be.</i>

381
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,860
BART: They're getting ready
to throw the switch!

382
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,070
Come on, Lisa. Hurry!

383
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,820
Let's just pray this hits the prison.

384
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,493
(whistling)

385
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:44,413
-(gasps) Huh?
-(gasps)

386
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,163
Smithers, there's a rocket in my pocket.

387
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,536
You don't have to tell me, sir.

388
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,921
(grunting) <i>Turn off the chair.</i>

389
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,131
<i>-Turn off the chair.</i>
-(all gasping)

390
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,387
"Electric chair is on," eh?

391
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:06,470
{\an8}Then the old prison has been
getting free electricity for 30 years.

392
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,476
I'll put a stop to that.

393
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:15,399
(grunting) (groaning)

394
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:19,402
<i>-Yea! Yeah.</i>
<i>-Wow! That was really entertaining.</i>

395
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,486
<i>-How did you make that smoke?</i>
-(groans)

396
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,121
-Yeah! All right! Whoo!
-All right!

397
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,449
-Way to go, Ralph!
-Ralph?

398
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,035
But the rocket was my idea.

399
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,331
-But asking you was Ralph's idea.
-You're the man, Ralph!

400
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,786
But surely I deserve some credit for--

401
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,666
BART AND HOMER: Ralph! Ralph! Ralph!

402
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:40,173
{\an8}Ah, let him have this one, Lise.
After all, it's Ralph.

403
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,877
Ralph! Ralph! Ralph! Ralph!

404
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,428
Ah, you've done grand, laddie.

405
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,562
{\an8}Now you know what you have to do-

406
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,309
{\an8}burn the house down!

407
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,021
{\an8}Burn 'em all!

408
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,937
(theme music playing)

409
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,194
Shh!
