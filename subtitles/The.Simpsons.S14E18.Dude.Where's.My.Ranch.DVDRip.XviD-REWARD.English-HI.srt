Homer, those are elk.

336
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,080
I still hate them.

337
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,210

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,560
Lisa, Clara told me
about how you saved her last night.

340
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,010
- Did Clara tell you anything else?
- No.

341
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,460
Just that she felt mighty stupid
for getting herself lost in them woods.

342
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,680
Listen, Luke.
It's my fault Clara got lost.

343
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,820
I didn't know she was your sister
and I wanted you all to myself.

344
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,170
You would do that just for me?

345
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,410
That's despicable.

346
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,710
You're the kind of slicker my family
left Central Park West to avoid.

347
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,730
You got a lot of chutzpah, missy.
Goodbye.

349
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,010
Oh, I had my first crush.

350
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,580
And all it did
was make me do terrible things...

351
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,830
...and then break my heart.

352
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,450
Lisa, welcome to love.

353
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,900
It's full of doubt and pain
and uncertainty.

354
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,670
But then one day, you find a man
you love so much, it hurts.

355
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,220
- Who is he?
- You, Homie.

356
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,320
Whoo-hoo!
In your face, imaginary guy.
