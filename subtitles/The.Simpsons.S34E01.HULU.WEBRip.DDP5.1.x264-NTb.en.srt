So, all in favor

4
00:00:27,556 --> 00:00:29,626
no longer celebrating
Columbus Day

5
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:33,096
due to the problematic behavior
of Christopher Columbus?

6
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,139
MAJORITY: Aye.

7
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:36,435
- All opposed?
-(exclaiming)

8
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:39,609
Now I'll hand it over to
the terrifyingly engaged citizen

9
00:00:39,613 --> 00:00:42,993
who has had her hand up
since before the meeting began,

10
00:00:42,986 --> 00:00:44,816
Helen Lovejoy.

(audience grumbles)

12
00:00:46,594 --> 00:00:49,034
I've noticed lately that people
have been putting up

13
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:51,771
quite a few little DIY
free libraries

14
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:52,940
all over town.

15
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:55,549
What's DIY stand for?

16
00:00:55,545 --> 00:00:56,775
Do it yourself.

17
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,120
I'm trying to but I can't.

18
00:00:59,118 --> 00:01:02,218
Just this past week,
six new ones popped up.

19
00:01:02,224 --> 00:01:04,064
-(murmuring)
- Hallelujah!

20
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:05,671
Think about the consequences, people.

21
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:06,965
Free books?

22
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,597
What if one of them
is the <i>Kama Sutra?</i>

23
00:01:08,604 --> 00:01:11,314
That's just bait
for learned perverts.

24
00:01:11,309 --> 00:01:14,719
There is no classical art
without <i>the erotic.</i>

25
00:01:14,716 --> 00:01:17,046
- Ew.
- You and me
got to hang sometime.

26
00:01:17,054 --> 00:01:19,064
I like those little libraries.

27
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:20,528
Unlike the public school library,

28
00:01:20,528 --> 00:01:23,028
these have books
written after 1945.

29
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:24,743
The children think Iceland
is still a kingdom.

30
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,706
Oh, these abominations
don't follow the rules

31
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:29,449
of my neighborhood association.

32
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:32,615
What if someone paints it
an unauthorized shade of white?

33
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:34,589
Like Swiss coffee.

34
00:01:34,589 --> 00:01:36,329
(indistinct chatter)

35
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:38,496
Homer Simpson here.

36
00:01:38,496 --> 00:01:41,666
Today I'm standing, even
in the presence of a chair,

37
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,470
to say what if we took

38
00:01:43,473 --> 00:01:45,383
all the little free book huts

39
00:01:45,377 --> 00:01:48,117
and moved them
into one big building

40
00:01:48,116 --> 00:01:50,286
open to everybody?

41
00:01:51,089 --> 00:01:53,999
Do you mean like... a library?

42
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:57,195
-(Homer whimpers)
-(laughing)

43
00:01:57,201 --> 00:02:00,211
- He's so slow.
- Nothing upstairs.

44
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:02,477
- Aw, what a dummy.
<i>- Idiota.</i>

45
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:05,989
Am I really a stupid man?

46
00:02:05,985 --> 00:02:08,355
I... Well, uh...

47
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:11,126
Sorry, reflections can't talk.
Got to go.

48
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,274
<i>(Homer moans)</i>

49
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,380
You guys say ideas
all the time.

50
00:02:18,376 --> 00:02:20,976
The one time I say one
they shoot me down,

51
00:02:20,982 --> 00:02:23,222
just like they shot down
the <i>Titanic.</i>

52
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:25,589
Actually, the <i>Titanic...</i>

53
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:27,461
Face it, Marge,

54
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:29,271
you're married to a dummy.

55
00:02:29,265 --> 00:02:32,705
- No, a dum-dum.
-(gasps)

56
00:02:32,706 --> 00:02:36,776
Oh, this big, beautiful head
is full of great ideas

57
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,780
just waiting to be set free.

58
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,064
I might be okay
if you do that

59
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:42,755
for the rest of my life.

60
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:45,869
I know just the place that will
make you feel better.

61
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:49,839
Did you see how
the credit card thing

62
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,410
at the ticket booth
told me to remove my card,

63
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:53,811
like I didn't know
how to do it?

64
00:02:53,814 --> 00:02:57,864
Then it got stuck 'cause
I didn't know how to do it.

65
00:02:57,856 --> 00:02:59,386
Let's just go home.

66
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:02,102
We haven't even
seen any animals yet.

67
00:03:02,097 --> 00:03:05,167
So? Even the animals
will think I'm dumb.

68
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,210
Oh, don't be silly.

69
00:03:07,207 --> 00:03:08,707
(cackling)

70
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:11,751
That's just the sound
hyenas make.

71
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,450
(laughing)

72
00:03:13,453 --> 00:03:14,663
(moans)

73
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:17,332
Slow Leonard?

74
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:19,527
I've always loved
that tortoise.

75
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,773
I can't believe
Leonard is still alive.

76
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:24,582
The mighty tortoise.

77
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:27,616
Dumber than me.
Loser to the hare.

78
00:03:27,615 --> 00:03:30,415
The tortoise famously
wins that race.

79
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,830
Really?
I only read the beginning

80
00:03:32,826 --> 00:03:34,496
of that story really fast.

81
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:36,465
Then I got tired
and took a nap.

82
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,396
I don't see any tortoise.

83
00:03:40,575 --> 00:03:44,115
Excuse me, do you know
what happened to Leonard?

84
00:03:44,115 --> 00:03:46,245
Leonard? Huh.
I don't see him.

85
00:03:46,252 --> 00:03:48,962
That's weird. Well,
the thing about a tortoise is

86
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,188
they're always somewhere.

87
00:03:50,193 --> 00:03:52,973
He must have gotten out.
Who's in charge here?

88
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,266
I am the director of the zoo.

89
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,510
Would you like a koala sticker?

90
00:03:56,507 --> 00:04:00,047
Yes, I would.
Slow Leonard is missing.

91
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:02,116
Now, let's not panic, sir.

92
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,117
I don't see him either,
but I'm sure

93
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:05,691
there's some explanation.

94
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:06,861
We'll look into it.

95
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,760
Look into it?

96
00:04:07,762 --> 00:04:10,432
I know when I'm being
talked down to.

97
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:12,774
- You think I'm dumb,
don't you?
- No,

98
00:04:12,772 --> 00:04:15,752
I don't, but do you
have a degree in zoology?

99
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:19,285
No, but I've seen
the comedy classic <i>Zookeeper</i>

100
00:04:19,285 --> 00:04:21,285
- 19 times.
- I love that movie.

101
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:23,059
I don't need your approval,

102
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:25,329
and neither does
Sylvester Stallone,

103
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,370
as the voice of Joe,
the African lion.

104
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:31,211
A tortoise is missing,

105
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:33,209
and this dumb guy

106
00:04:33,213 --> 00:04:36,123
is gonna find him.

107
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:38,319
(grunts)

108
00:04:40,528 --> 00:04:43,728
There we go.
A recent picture.

109
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,240
Mom, it's late, I'm worried.

110
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:49,781
Why isn't Dad at Moe's?
Is Moe all right?

111
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:52,649
He's fine. Your dad's
been looking for clues

112
00:04:52,652 --> 00:04:54,822
in those zoo pictures
all night.

113
00:04:54,823 --> 00:04:59,033
Come on, buddy, you're
smart enough to crack this.

114
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:00,701
(gasps)
Dolly tire tracks.

115
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,441
I bet someone used a dolly
to cart Leonard off.

116
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,679
And those treads are clearly
from a Haul-Pro convertible

117
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,420
with a weight cap
of 500 pounds.

118
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:12,058
Wow, Dad, how did you
figure that out?

119
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:14,257
Eh, yep, well,
your dad knows

120
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:17,301
a thing or two about dollies.

121
00:05:17,301 --> 00:05:20,371
Drive safe, ya bum.

122
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:23,052
I think you'll find
these photos

123
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:27,146
more than enough proof to open
a missing turtle investigation.

124
00:05:27,154 --> 00:05:28,494
Wow, Homer, you're right.

125
00:05:28,489 --> 00:05:31,159
These photos are
incredible evidence.

126
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:33,632
- Really?
- Evidence of how dumb you are.

127
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:36,014
I just love it when
regular people think

128
00:05:36,005 --> 00:05:37,575
they can solve crimes.

129
00:05:37,575 --> 00:05:40,345
It's like a dog thinking
he can mow the lawn.

130
00:05:40,347 --> 00:05:42,277
(laughing)

131
00:05:42,284 --> 00:05:44,094
- Aw.
- Look at...

132
00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:45,528
Hey.

133
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,900
No one takes me seriously.

134
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:51,768
You know, there's a lot
of specific interest groups

135
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:52,740
on Facelook.

136
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:54,609
I'm in one about
knitting mug cozies

137
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:57,209
with a little window so you can
read the funny message

138
00:05:57,214 --> 00:05:58,484
on the mug.
(chuckles)

139
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,993
Why don't you check
to see if there's a group

140
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:02,458
about Leonard's case?

141
00:06:02,457 --> 00:06:06,267
Social media?
Is that website still on?

142
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:09,065
Hey, there is a missing
tortoise group here.

143
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:11,481
(gasps)
It's called Lost Leonard!

144
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,605
But what if they say
I'm stupid

145
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:15,384
or drag me in the comments?

146
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:17,523
Do you know how scary it is
in this climate

147
00:06:17,522 --> 00:06:19,022
to be a dumb white man?

148
00:06:19,024 --> 00:06:20,634
You care about that turtle.

149
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:22,928
I think you'll feel better
if you try.

150
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:25,502
(sighs)
The police don't believe me,

151
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:28,384
but I'm posting some photos
that I think prove

152
00:06:28,376 --> 00:06:31,476
that Slow Leonard
has been kidnapped.

153
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:33,524
(whimpers)

154
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,830
(computer chiming)

155
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:38,125
Dad, they're agreeing
with you.

156
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:40,129
They think Leonard
was stolen, too.

157
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,643
Really? Oh, my God.

158
00:06:41,637 --> 00:06:43,367
A group of anonymous
cyber sleuths

159
00:06:43,373 --> 00:06:44,883
don't think I'm an idiot.

160
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:46,406
They like what I said.

161
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:50,222
(giggles)
That tickles.

162
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,090
The Internet thinks I'm smart.

163
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:59,344
Okay, this is Homer S.
live streaming

164
00:06:59,338 --> 00:07:00,808
to the Lost Leonard
Facelook group

165
00:07:00,808 --> 00:07:03,708
from the scene of the crime.
Are we all on?

166
00:07:07,187 --> 00:07:08,987
How convenient.

167
00:07:08,991 --> 00:07:11,231
They're replacing Leonard
with a much more

168
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:12,698
Instagrammable animal.

169
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:15,399
One that can fit
into baby clothes.

170
00:07:15,403 --> 00:07:18,143
Maybe we have our motive.

171
00:07:18,142 --> 00:07:20,282
- Of course.
- Brilliant.

172
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,050
Thanks, guys.
I do what I can,

173
00:07:23,052 --> 00:07:24,592
which is a lot.

174
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:26,559
Look at this, dream team.

175
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,930
A video doorbell
across the street from the zoo.

176
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:31,843
How convenient.

177
00:07:31,837 --> 00:07:34,607
Oh. It's actually
very convenient.

178
00:07:36,278 --> 00:07:38,178
Simpson, what can
I do for you?

179
00:07:38,182 --> 00:07:40,862
For us. I don't know if you've
heard the terrible news

180
00:07:40,855 --> 00:07:43,085
that Slow Leonard
has been kidnapped.

181
00:07:43,092 --> 00:07:44,732
What?! Not Leonard.

182
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:46,999
Why couldn't they have taken
one of those damn

183
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,970
barking seals instead?

184
00:07:48,971 --> 00:07:50,781
(seals barking)

185
00:07:50,775 --> 00:07:52,805
When do you monsters sleep?!

186
00:07:52,812 --> 00:07:55,282
I'm a member of a team
of cyber sleuths

187
00:07:55,283 --> 00:07:56,453
searching for Leonard.

188
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:58,522
Can we look at your
door camera footage?

189
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:00,334
Oh, of course. And, um,

190
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:01,757
I'd love to join the group.

191
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:04,203
But, uh, you guys
probably already have,

192
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:06,141
uh, a superintendent.

193
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:09,408
- We do now.
-(chuckles)

194
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:11,351
<i>HOMER:
Marge. Marge.</i>

195
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:14,519
Marge, fan out those
cocktail napkins.

196
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:17,032
Or did you not watch
the TikTok I sent you?

197
00:08:17,027 --> 00:08:18,757
Calm down.

198
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,404
I've never seen you
this excited

199
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,670
for a meet and greet.

200
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,340
Yeah, so who's coming
to this thing again?

201
00:08:24,341 --> 00:08:25,611
Internet randos?

202
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:27,411
Let me tell you something, son.

203
00:08:27,414 --> 00:08:30,454
Every human being
is born an Internet rando.

204
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:31,993
And then they stay
Internet randos

205
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,930
until they connect
over a cause.

206
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:35,967
And then and only then
do they achieve

207
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:40,265
their full potential
and become not random.

208
00:08:40,273 --> 00:08:42,383
Dad, is that really...

209
00:08:42,377 --> 00:08:44,077
Duh, yes. Paella.

210
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:46,821
What do you think all this
toasted saffron is for?

211
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,520
You've never
toasted us anything.

212
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:49,864
Not even toast.

213
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:51,899
I don't need to show off
for you, Marge.

214
00:08:51,897 --> 00:08:53,567
You already bought the cow.

215
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:56,267
I finally have a group
of friends who think I'm smart.

216
00:08:56,272 --> 00:08:58,242
Who haven't used
a skeptical emoji

217
00:08:58,242 --> 00:09:00,552
with a monocle
even once with me.

218
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:01,548
(doorbell rings)

219
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,550
(gasps)
They're here.

220
00:09:02,552 --> 00:09:04,322
Keep stirring gently, slow.

221
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:06,991
- Like stirring a baby.
-(grumbles)

222
00:09:07,795 --> 00:09:09,095
Thanks for hosting, Homer.

223
00:09:09,098 --> 00:09:11,538
I would have,
but my infinity pool broke.

224
00:09:11,536 --> 00:09:13,106
Its edge is now finite.

225
00:09:13,106 --> 00:09:16,106
I'm up to my eyeballs
in contractors and physicists.

226
00:09:16,112 --> 00:09:20,052
Come in. Oh, you all look
so much like your avatars.

227
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:22,993
I got paella, of course,
a big-screen TV

228
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:24,562
for viewing
surveillance footage,

229
00:09:24,562 --> 00:09:25,802
an evidence board

230
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,668
and, of course,
yarn for connecting

231
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,008
our seemingly unrelated photos.

232
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:33,376
Um, is this genuine
Mrs. McClellan's Evidence Yarn?

233
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:34,679
<i>Fancy.</i>

234
00:09:34,682 --> 00:09:37,052
Why, yes, it is.
Illuminati strength.

235
00:09:37,053 --> 00:09:40,663
Nine out of ten scientists
are afraid of it.

236
00:09:42,197 --> 00:09:45,967
I'd like to thank Homer
for this extraordinary paella.

237
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:50,381
My mouth would swear
it is in Barcelona.

238
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,380
(indistinct conversations)

239
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,224
♪

240
00:09:58,697 --> 00:10:01,337
Hey, uh, uh,
not to go down a rabbit hole,

241
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,035
but this plot could go deep,

242
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:05,679
and the one person
we haven't looked at yet

243
00:10:05,678 --> 00:10:07,648
is the zoo director.

244
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,988
(scoffs)
The zoo director. Um, Gil,

245
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:12,856
- isn't that a little desperate?
- Hold it.

246
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:15,829
There's one thing you need to
know about this paella party.

247
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:17,971
There are no bad ideas.

248
00:10:17,969 --> 00:10:20,209
Nothing said here is stupid.

249
00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:21,306
BOTH:
Mm-hmm.

250
00:10:21,308 --> 00:10:23,108
- Mm...
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

251
00:10:23,112 --> 00:10:24,852
Oh, then I want to say
I agree with Gil

252
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:28,159
about the zoo director.
We should board it.

253
00:10:28,156 --> 00:10:30,896
Has anybody dug through
the tortoise scat yet?

254
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:33,965
Maybe he was being used
as a drug mule.

255
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,067
Board it.

256
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:38,639
Perhaps Leonard's seed
was required by scientists

257
00:10:38,644 --> 00:10:40,684
who want to breed
slower horses.

258
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,081
- Uh, board it!
- Board it!

259
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,353
Uh, h-hey...

260
00:10:44,354 --> 00:10:45,964
how about that?

261
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,928
The yarn knows something
we're still figuring out.

262
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:50,871
We're gonna find this turtle,

263
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:53,468
but damn it,
we found love along the way.

264
00:10:53,472 --> 00:10:57,182
Oh, oh! What if the turtle
was taken by a billionaire

265
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,220
to transfuse his blood
for longevity?

266
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,260
ALL:
Board it.

267
00:11:01,255 --> 00:11:02,485
Mom, are we worried

268
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,300
this group is crossing into
the conspiracy theory zone?

269
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:09,398
Mmm, as long as he's got
a heavy hand with the saffron,

270
00:11:09,404 --> 00:11:10,474
who cares?

271
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:12,483
Well, these people are finally

272
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:14,407
taking your father seriously.

273
00:11:14,414 --> 00:11:15,484
He's not used to that.

274
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:17,693
Bart, you're always
telling him

275
00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:19,088
his ideas are dumb.

276
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:21,531
And, Lisa, you're always
proving it.

277
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,170
He deserves a chance
to be a big fish

278
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:25,567
in a small, weird pond.

279
00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:27,341
So let him have this.

280
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,040
It's all harmless enough.

281
00:11:29,044 --> 00:11:30,354
So it's decided.

282
00:11:30,346 --> 00:11:33,346
We're protesting in front
of the zoo director's house.

283
00:11:33,352 --> 00:11:37,292
I shall bring the milk
in case they tear gas us.

284
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:38,664
Mm...

285
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,534
ALL:
We can't be more emphatic,

286
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,814
we think Leonard's
in your attic.

287
00:11:42,805 --> 00:11:44,635
Please stop these protests.

288
00:11:44,642 --> 00:11:46,552
Why would I kidnap an animal?

289
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:47,846
That's what a zoo is:

290
00:11:47,848 --> 00:11:49,748
a bunch of kidnapped animals.

291
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:52,462
-(stammers)
- It's the cops!

292
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:57,129
If you're gonna pepper spray me,
do it fast.

293
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,973
I don't have much
phone battery left.

294
00:11:58,971 --> 00:12:02,141
Calm down, I'm not here
as Police Chief Wiggum.

295
00:12:02,143 --> 00:12:04,923
I'm here as Clancy Wiggum,
a simple civilian

296
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,816
hungry for turtle justice.

297
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,190
Justice you'll never get from

298
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:10,589
a cold, faceless
police department.

299
00:12:10,594 --> 00:12:12,774
Uh-oh, body camera's on.

300
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,035
Don't worry, I can erase it
with a paper clip.

301
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:16,966
They, uh, they taught us how.

302
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:18,913
I need to say something
to a woman

303
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:20,751
I'm very much in love with.

304
00:12:20,748 --> 00:12:22,788
Lizzie, before
this group started,

305
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:26,255
I was in a shell
of my own making.

306
00:12:26,258 --> 00:12:27,658
Oh, my God.

307
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:30,002
So I'm poking my head out
and asking

308
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,739
in front of our
new best friends,

309
00:12:31,736 --> 00:12:34,406
will you make me
the happiest man

310
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:36,178
on this flat earth?

311
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,880
Yes, yes.

312
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,454
I can't wait to spend
the rest of my life

313
00:12:40,453 --> 00:12:42,763
taping together
shredded documents with you.

314
00:12:42,758 --> 00:12:45,198
- Hooray.
- Aw.

315
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:47,126
Sure, the wedding planning
is a lot of work,

316
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,643
but the group is also learning
how to sweep for spyware

317
00:12:50,641 --> 00:12:52,011
and pick locks.

318
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,580
That's why all our doorknobs
are in that basket.

319
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:59,494
Homie, I wonder
if your cabal's ideas

320
00:12:59,491 --> 00:13:01,731
are getting maybe a little

321
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,730
too far out of the box?

322
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:05,074
Thank you, Marge.

323
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:06,639
You know what's inside boxes?

324
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,940
Styrofoam peanuts and lies.

325
00:13:08,944 --> 00:13:11,054
And I'm tired of being fed both.

326
00:13:11,048 --> 00:13:12,588
- The beauty
of this group is that
- Hmm?

327
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:14,915
- we always support each other.
There isn't one theory
- Hmm...

328
00:13:14,922 --> 00:13:16,662
- about Leonard that's right.
- Mm.

329
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,130
They're all right.
He could be anywhere.

330
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,571
- Like the kitchen?
- Exactly.

331
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:25,739
No, he's literally
in the kitchen.

332
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:27,524
(gasps)
Homer,

333
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,145
did you kidnap Leonard?

334
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:34,833
No, I didn't commit the crime.

335
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:36,829
I did something much worse.

336
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:39,572
I solved it.

337
00:13:45,751 --> 00:13:48,691
Why the hell
is Slow Leonard in our house?

338
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,090
Do I have to tell you?

339
00:13:50,093 --> 00:13:52,263
Can't we just accept this
as the new normal?

340
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:56,313
There's a 500-pound tortoise
chewing on my kitchen table.

341
00:13:56,305 --> 00:13:57,805
It's not normal.

342
00:13:57,808 --> 00:13:59,808
- Okay, here goes.
-(hisses)

343
00:13:59,812 --> 00:14:01,122
After our protest,

344
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:03,615
<i>I went back
to the tortoise enclosure</i>

345
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,520
<i>for one last look.</i>

346
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:07,696
Huh?

347
00:14:07,695 --> 00:14:10,265
My doughnut hole!
(whimpers)

348
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,096
(grunting)

349
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,571
Ooh, ooh! Aah! Ow, ow!

350
00:14:13,573 --> 00:14:15,213
(grunts)
Mm?

351
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:17,349
<i>That's when I discovered
a doughnut hole</i>

352
00:14:17,347 --> 00:14:19,587
<i>will always return
to its mother</i>

353
00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:21,755
<i>a larger hole.</i>

354
00:14:21,756 --> 00:14:24,756
(gasps)
Leonard. You weren't kidnapped.

355
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:26,902
You were right here all along.

356
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,010
Wait, so after following
all those crazy leads,

357
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:33,776
you found Leonard by going down
an actual rabbit hole?

358
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,920
- Yeah, so?
- Don't you see the irony?

359
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,830
Oh, now I don't get it.

360
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:41,096
Anyway...

361
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:44,425
Guys, you'll never believe it,
but I found...

362
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:45,544
Just hold that thought.

363
00:14:45,537 --> 00:14:48,407
I made us all evidence
collection fanny packs.

364
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:51,919
Which we'll all wear
on the pedal bus pub crawl.

365
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,246
Are you coming, Homer?

366
00:14:53,252 --> 00:14:55,492
There's a guac trough
in the middle.

367
00:14:56,526 --> 00:14:59,896
<i>HOMER:
If I told 'em I found him,
the group would end.</i>

368
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,639
How could I let that happen?

369
00:15:01,636 --> 00:15:05,876
Those friendless weirdos have
become my best weird friends.

370
00:15:05,878 --> 00:15:08,448
They're the only people
who don't say "Einstein"

371
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,049
after "great idea,"
or "Sherlock" after...

372
00:15:11,054 --> 00:15:13,964
Oh, you have to
tell them the truth.

373
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,300
Well, the truth
is different these days.

374
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:18,768
It's more of a hunch
you're willing to die for.

375
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,210
No, it's not!

376
00:15:20,206 --> 00:15:22,576
But tomorrow Gil and
Miss Hoover are getting married

377
00:15:22,578 --> 00:15:24,108
on Chem Trail Island,

378
00:15:24,114 --> 00:15:26,124
and we're all going to wear
matching head shields

379
00:15:26,118 --> 00:15:28,658
so that Bluetooth can't steal
winning lottery numbers

380
00:15:28,657 --> 00:15:29,957
from our brains.

381
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:31,959
Homer, you solved the mystery.

382
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:35,103
This confederacy of nutsos
has gone too far.

383
00:15:35,103 --> 00:15:37,343
You're all acting dumb.

384
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,080
(gasps)
Dumb.

385
00:15:39,077 --> 00:15:40,847
You think I'm dumb, Marge?

386
00:15:40,848 --> 00:15:42,248
Just like everyone
at the library

387
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,290
and all the other smartypantseseseses

388
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:46,629
in this town?

389
00:15:46,626 --> 00:15:49,596
Well, you can't shame me into
turning my back on my people.

390
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:52,669
I'm going to that
conspiracy-themed wedding.

391
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:54,111
And you're no longer
my plus-one,

392
00:15:54,107 --> 00:15:57,247
which is your loss
because I'm at a great table.

393
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,947
Equidistant from the bar
and the bathroom.

00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:34,121
a turtle-stealing plot,

403
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,360
also uncovered an undying love.

404
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,000
ALL:
Aw.

405
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:40,527
Yeah, I, too, have a toast.

406
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:43,144
To us bringing to justice
the zoo director,

407
00:16:43,138 --> 00:16:44,938
who knows where that turtle is.

408
00:16:44,942 --> 00:16:47,012
-(whimpers)
- Who's got ideas?

409
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:49,353
Remember, this is a safe space

410
00:16:49,351 --> 00:16:51,861
for all dangerous
and violent plans.

411
00:16:51,856 --> 00:16:54,386
Easy. We dump a swarm
of murder hornets

412
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:56,634
- down her chimney.
- Uh...
- Board it!

413
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:58,403
I can stuff a couple
of bricks of cocaine

414
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:00,542
- in her wheel well.
- Board it.

415
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:04,051
Let's cut the brake lines
on her brand-new Prius.

416
00:17:04,047 --> 00:17:07,017
- Board...
- No, don't board it.

417
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,260
Don't board any of it.

418
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:11,087
-(all gasp)
- What?
- Why?

419
00:17:11,094 --> 00:17:13,734
Because the zoo director
didn't do anything wrong,

420
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,373
and punishing an innocent
zoo director is...

421
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:18,541
a bad idea.

422
00:17:18,543 --> 00:17:19,483
(all gasp)

423
00:17:19,477 --> 00:17:22,317
But you said
there were no bad ideas.

424
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:25,317
I was wrong.
Most ideas are bad.

425
00:17:25,323 --> 00:17:28,733
It's okay to think them,
just don't act on them.

426
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,600
Apostasy!

427
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:33,911
He's not an "us" anymore,
he's a "them."

428
00:17:33,907 --> 00:17:36,547
ALL:
Them! Them! Them!

429
00:17:36,546 --> 00:17:38,476
Enough is enough!

430
00:17:38,482 --> 00:17:41,222
Look, we have Slow Leonard.
He wasn't kidnapped.

431
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:45,161
Real, living turtle!

432
00:17:45,162 --> 00:17:46,372
Let's talk sense here.

433
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,135
The most obvious explanation

434
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:50,105
is the one that's
before our very eyes.

435
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:51,976
- Hey, it's true.
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

436
00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:53,276
Oh, thank God.

437
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,219
This is not Slow Leonard,
this is a robot.

438
00:17:56,218 --> 00:17:59,358
A robot built
by Homeland Security

439
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:02,797
to scan our tongues
to see whom we've kissed.

440
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,238
We'll prove it. Scan him
with your robot detectors.

441
00:18:06,238 --> 00:18:08,178
Guys, it is the turtle.

442
00:18:08,175 --> 00:18:10,005
And those robot detectors
are made of

443
00:18:10,012 --> 00:18:12,182
hair dryers and old video games.

444
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:14,393
Look, we had
a great ride together.

445
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:16,627
The paintball
and pinot noir weekend,

446
00:18:16,626 --> 00:18:18,956
the duck boat tour
of Shelbyville,

447
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,334
storming City Hall.

448
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,573
It felt so good
to be part of a community

449
00:18:22,571 --> 00:18:24,711
Where we're all
respected and supported.

450
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:27,209
But we can't pull our heads
inside our shells

451
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:30,053
and hide from
the very real truth:

452
00:18:30,052 --> 00:18:32,792
our lost turtle has been found.

453
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,761
(detector powers down)

454
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:38,144
I cannot believe
I'm saying this.

455
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:39,905
It's not a robot.

456
00:18:39,905 --> 00:18:41,975
<i>DETECTOR:
Dr. J, super dunk!</i>

457
00:18:41,976 --> 00:18:44,006
But what happens to all of us

458
00:18:44,014 --> 00:18:45,984
when we don't have
anything to solve?

459
00:18:45,984 --> 00:18:47,554
Nothing has to change.

460
00:18:47,554 --> 00:18:50,864
We have more in common than
just the tortoise, don't we?

461
00:18:50,861 --> 00:18:52,831
Well, we must. Right?

462
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:56,667
-(sobs)
- Aw, nuts.

463
00:18:56,673 --> 00:18:58,313
Oh, great.

464
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:01,349
Now I have to get this
lasered off.

465
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,248
I love being in this group,
but it's over.

466
00:19:04,254 --> 00:19:06,024
And now I and the rest of us

467
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:07,464
have to go back
to a world where

468
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,900
everyone thinks we're dumb.

469
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:15,343
(panting)
Unless

470
00:19:15,343 --> 00:19:18,023
we find a new mystery
only we can solve.

471
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:19,445
Like...

472
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:23,531
Where does calamari
really come from?

473
00:19:23,526 --> 00:19:25,726
Well, the common wisdom
is that it's squid,

474
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:29,541
but I say there's
no such thing as a squid.

475
00:19:29,538 --> 00:19:31,008
Board it.

476
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:33,708
Mmm, that's good squid.
(chuckles)

477
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:35,453
I heard it's pig butt,

478
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:38,259
but the shadow pig butt counsel
spends billions

479
00:19:38,255 --> 00:19:40,055
quashing those rumors.

480
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:42,659
Board it.

481
00:19:42,664 --> 00:19:45,244
As long as we're
blowing each other's minds,

482
00:19:45,236 --> 00:19:47,106
I've heard there's
a cartoon show

483
00:19:47,106 --> 00:19:48,906
that can predict the future.

484
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,310
Maybe we can watch it

485
00:19:50,312 --> 00:19:52,522
and find out
what's going to happen.

486
00:19:56,826 --> 00:19:58,456
Board it.

487
00:19:58,462 --> 00:19:59,572
COMIC BOOK GUY:
Indubitably.

488
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,495
- WIGGUM: Making up stuff is fun.
- HOOVER: Yeah. Mm-hmm.

489
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:04,412
Well, I guess no matter
how crazy and lame people are,

490
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:08,177
they always want to hang
with other crazy lame-os.

491
00:20:08,182 --> 00:20:11,492
I'm no conspiracy theorist,
but I do wonder

492
00:20:11,488 --> 00:20:15,598
who stands to benefit
from all of... this?

493
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:17,597
- Space here.
- Multiverse!
- Board it.

494
00:20:17,601 --> 00:20:19,341
- Okay, that's good.
- CHALMERS: And here's
another idea.

495
00:20:19,337 --> 00:20:20,407
- WIGGUM: Oh, that's...
- HOMER: Hold on, I need

496
00:20:20,406 --> 00:20:21,366
- more cards.
- COMIC BOOK GUY: Yes!

497
00:20:21,374 --> 00:20:23,584
<i>(chatter continuing)</i>

498
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:26,953
Our profits
are through the roof.

499
00:20:26,953 --> 00:20:30,463
We can't make enough yarn,
index cards and ivermectin.

500
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:32,299
We're in a golden age.

501
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:34,466
Keep defunding schools, America.

00:20:44,555 --> 00:20:46,625
Okay, everybody, today we're
making one of my

506
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:49,766
favorite dishes:
conspiracy-meeting paella.

507
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:51,965
It's a great dish
for blowing the lid off

508
00:20:51,969 --> 00:20:55,679
any diabolical plot the
mainstream media won't cover.

509
00:20:55,677 --> 00:20:59,147
CIA murders in your town,
UFO stuff.

510
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,690
And it even pairs well

511
00:21:00,687 --> 00:21:03,157
with a New World Order scenario.

512
00:21:03,158 --> 00:21:04,658
Now, this is a dish
where the freshness

513
00:21:04,662 --> 00:21:06,772
of the ingredients
really matters,

514
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:10,236
like this chorizo
made from home-schooled pigs.

515
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:12,479
If you're a lizard person
watching this,

516
00:21:12,477 --> 00:21:15,147
instead of using chicken,
feel free to go with

517
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,259
whatever insect
or small mammal goes well

518
00:21:18,255 --> 00:21:20,055
with Calasparra rice.

519
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:21,559
Well, that's all
you need to know.

520
00:21:21,562 --> 00:21:23,772
Let me know in the comments
how it turned out,

521
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:26,466
and what shape
you think the sun is.

522
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:30,882
Shh!
