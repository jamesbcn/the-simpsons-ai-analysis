1
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:09,678
Sorry, little dudes,
we're gonna be here a while.

2
00:00:09,711 --> 00:00:13,748
A truck broke down, and the cops are
taking their sweet time clearing it up.

3
00:00:13,782 --> 00:00:16,517
He thinks
my tummy is a mountain.

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,687
Lou, Lou, quick, take a selfie.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,588
It's not a selfie if I take it.

6
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,456
He's kissing me.

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,525
Take a selfie! Take a selfie!

8
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:27,128
Oh, man, my phone's dead.

9
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,030
Milhouse, what am I missing
in the group text?

10
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:30,665
It's awesome.

11
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,934
You're never gonna get
caught up.

12
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:38,339
What kind of jazz you
listening to, stupid or boring?

13
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,274
It's Marc Maron's podcast.

14
00:00:40,308 --> 00:00:43,778
He does cool interviews
with really interesting people.

15
00:00:43,812 --> 00:00:45,780
Lame, lame, don't know him.

16
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:47,782
Lame, lame,
don't know her.

17
00:00:47,816 --> 00:00:49,718
Loudon Wainwright, lame, lame.

18
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:53,487
This guy interviewed Krusty?

19
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:58,393
Yeah. Hey, no,
that's my ear bu...

20
00:00:58,827 --> 00:01:00,161
It's yours now.

21
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,831
That's incredible, Krusty.

22
00:01:02,864 --> 00:01:04,632
I mean, really, I'm blown away.

23
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:07,568
Yeah, well, it's true.
It's absolutely true.

24
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:10,471
I have a phobia of pies.

25
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:13,541
That's so crazy because,
I mean, we've all seen you get

26
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,643
hit in the face with pies
on your show.

27
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:18,913
No, no, no, those are cakes
decorated as pies.

28
00:01:18,947 --> 00:01:22,751
Oh, right, so that's how you
make yourself feel safe.

29
00:01:22,784 --> 00:01:25,820
It's not the crust,
it's the fillings.

30
00:01:25,854 --> 00:01:27,655
Krusty, I got to ask you
about something,

31
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,824
and I don't want you
to get defensive,

32
00:01:29,858 --> 00:01:31,826
but it's something
you've never talked about.

33
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,996
Can you tell me about
The Sands of Space?

34
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:37,766
Oh, no.
That's off-limits, soul patch!

35
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,868
We could talk about
the exploding milkshakes

36
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:41,035
in your Laffy Meals.

37
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,771
Did they ever find
those kids' noses?

38
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:45,874
Okay, okay, I'll tell you about
The Sands of Space,

39
00:01:45,907 --> 00:01:49,778
the movie that almost
consumed my soul.

40
00:01:50,812 --> 00:01:52,713
Yeah, yeah, keep talking.

41
00:01:52,747 --> 00:01:54,282
I'm just feeding the cats.

42
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:57,786
It all began back in
the golden age of Hollywood,

43
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:02,090
the late 1980s,
when high concept was king.

44
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:04,893
You'd mix two kooky words
together in the title,

45
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:07,728
put a rap song at the end
that explains the plot,

46
00:02:07,762 --> 00:02:12,266
and, bam, you're on the cover
of Premiere magazine.

47
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,203
I had starred in the hit
action buddy comedy

48
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:16,737
Good Cop, Dog Cop,

49
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:19,774
where I played
a murdered police officer

50
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:22,977
who is reincarnated as his
partner's pet Saint Bernard.

51
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:26,747
Five smashed squad cars,
100 exploded helicopters,

52
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:28,950
and the mayor's wife has fleas.

53
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,785
Turn in your badge
and your collar.

54
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:32,921
You're suspended for a month!

55
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:34,789
For me,
that's like seven months.

56
00:02:34,823 --> 00:02:36,825
Dog Cop!

57
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:40,594
Suddenly, everyone in town

58
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,730
was dying to be
in the Krusty business,

59
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,766
and I was dipping shrimp
with all the big talents

60
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,736
I once longed to see fail.

61
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,173
And, of course, what the studio
wanted most was a sequel.

62
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:53,942
Okay, Krusty, we've got

63
00:02:53,975 --> 00:02:57,478
Good Cop, Dog Cop 2,
Golden Revolver all lined up.

64
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,313
We... who did the...

65
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:01,916
The two Terrys, they just
turned in a great script.

66
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,418
Savage Sam Borgberg
is all set to direct.

67
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:06,020
So when do we start?

68
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:08,656
I get it.
You think I'm just some hack,

69
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,860
out to churn out lazy sequels
for a quick buck.

70
00:03:12,894 --> 00:03:14,095
Yes.

71
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:16,797
This is my next movie.

72
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:18,867
The Sands of Space?

73
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,101
Krusty, are you kidding me?

74
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:23,171
This is the most famously
un-filmable book in history.

75
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:27,008
It made Kubrick a recluse.
It drove Coppola to wine.

76
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,943
The four Jeffs tried
to write a script,

77
00:03:28,977 --> 00:03:30,879
but even they couldn't crack it.

78
00:03:30,912 --> 00:03:34,348
When I bought this at
an adult bookstore by mistake,

79
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:36,317
it changed my life.

80
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,887
There's a light that shines
from star to star,

81
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,823
from soul to soul, connecting
everyone in the universe.

82
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:48,162
It's not landing for me
that the hero doesn't

83
00:03:48,196 --> 00:03:51,900
refuse the quest
before he accepts the quest.

84
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:53,134
Is that landing for you?

85
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:55,836
Look, I'm not drinking
out of one more toilet

86
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,906
until you green-light
this movie.

87
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:00,808
And I'm not playing
a dog either.

88
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,177
All right, we got a comic
who wants to make

89
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:05,846
a hippie-dippie
science-fiction vanity project.

90
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,884
Here's what we do. We humor him,
and we make it dirt cheap.

91
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:11,752
We could shoot it
in Mexico for nothing.

92
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,821
We hire a has-been to direct it

93
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,924
and never-wases
to do everything else.

94
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:19,593
After it bombs, that clown will
come scooting his butt back here

95
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:23,831
to make all the Dog Cop movies
we want. Two more.

96
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,866
The Sands of Space was a go,

97
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,669
and the studio hired
the least-qualified crew

98
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:31,239
they could find,
including a young couple

99
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,908
whose love was just
starting to bloom.

100
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:35,876
She was full of optimism,

101
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,180
and he was slightly less fat
than he was going to be.

102
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:40,714
What could be cooler?

103
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:44,285
You and me working on a movie
together all summer long

104
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,854
as production assistants.

105
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,923
It's so romantic.

106
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:51,259
We'll be like Elizabeth Taylor
and Richard Burton

107
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:53,861
if they had to get coffee
for everybody.

108
00:04:56,664 --> 00:05:00,634
All right, everyone,
saddle up for JuÃ¡rez, Mexico.

109
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:03,304
That's where I shot
Manhattan Mix Up.

110
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:06,074
Lost a lot of good men
on that show.

111
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:08,709
Now, move it out!

112
00:05:17,118 --> 00:05:18,786
Why are we stopping?

113
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,989
Oh, the bus has been
leaking oil for miles.

114
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:21,990
Look behind us.

115
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:24,425
Those things were literal?

116
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:35,936
The Sands of Space,
day one, shot one, take one.

117
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,006
And... action!

118
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:41,342
So barren, so alien,

119
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,644
yet somehow familiar.

120
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,180
Hey, what the hell is this?

121
00:05:46,214 --> 00:05:47,815
Cut. Cut it!

122
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:51,785
This sand is sand-colored.
It's supposed to be red.

123
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,155
So what? Sand is sand.

124
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,956
Did you even read the book?

125
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,859
These blood dunes
are all that's left of humanity

126
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,861
after the Rust Wars.

127
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,264
What's to read?
It's a space picture.

128
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:06,000
Laser cars,
girls with octopus arms,

129
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:08,702
zip zap glip glorp,
and it's in the can.

130
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,971
Look, you no-talent
bag of wrinkles.

131
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:13,141
Go back to whatever
Toluca Lake drunk tank

132
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:14,842
they fished you out of,

133
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,146
because you're not getting
anywhere near my movie!

134
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:22,116
Sir, I've worked
in moving pictures

135
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,018
since they were
called stillies.

136
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:26,954
I once shot a two-hour picture
in 90 minutes.

137
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:31,159
And so I say to you, in the
words of Miss Lillian Gish,

138
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:32,926
go crap in your hat.

139
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,532
And now, if you'll excuse me,

140
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:41,835
I am going to mysteriously
drown in the ocean.

141
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:48,576
As you may have heard, there's
been an amicable parting of ways

142
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:51,812
with that moron director.
We wish him well.

143
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:55,015
Clearly, there's only one artist
close enough to this film

144
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:57,752
to direct it, me.

145
00:06:58,186 --> 00:07:00,888
I know what you're thinking,
have I taken on too much

146
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,191
by starring
and directing a movie

147
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:05,759
that I was also tricked
into cofinancing?

148
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:09,263
No, because this story
must be told.

149
00:07:11,232 --> 00:07:13,033
This is so exciting.

150
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:17,205
Krusty's got the passion and
vision to make this movie great.

151
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,443
I have no idea
how to make a movie.

152
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:26,214
I know nothing.

153
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:28,682
All these people are screwed.

154
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:31,985
And the crew gift
is just a T-shirt.

155
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:36,391
Right, right, I get it.

156
00:07:36,725 --> 00:07:38,793
In the tradition
of every actor ever...

157
00:07:38,827 --> 00:07:41,729
- You thought you could direct.
- Directing seemed so easy.

158
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:44,532
You just hold your hands like
this, then bing, bang, boom,

159
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,300
Annie Leibovitz
is taking your portrait

160
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:48,035
in a bathtub full of milk.

161
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,804
Yeah, talk about
pressure though.

162
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,940
Man, I remember once
I was filming a special

163
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,242
at the Laugh Basement
in Tampa...

164
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:55,776
This isn't about you.

165
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,379
You got your ad in
for Dollar Doorknob Club.

166
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:00,248
Now, let me talk.

167
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:03,251
They say in Hollywood,
nobody knows anything.

168
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:05,719
Well, I knew a lot less
than that.

169
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:08,156
What do you like
for the princess's headpiece?

170
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:11,592
- Feathers or scales?
- I don't know, how about scales?

171
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,162
Oh, well, there goes
the whole costume budget.

172
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:15,429
For the crew lunch,

173
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:17,231
the grips want
their hot dogs boiled,

174
00:08:17,265 --> 00:08:18,966
but the gaffers
want them grilled.

175
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,102
Either way, I don't got no
hot dogs, so which is it?

176
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:24,738
Do you want the space ship doors
to open like,

177
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:28,142
zzztt-zzztt, ppswishh
or wahh-wahh?

178
00:08:28,176 --> 00:08:29,943
Judd Nelson won't come out
of his trailer.

179
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:32,346
Christian Slater won't go back
into his trailer.

180
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,182
How many sugars do you want
in your coffee?

181
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:36,317
Stop asking me things!

182
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,952
Is this an official break,
or are we taking a five?

183
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:41,989
Wahh-wahh.

184
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,158
That poor clown man.

185
00:08:44,192 --> 00:08:47,595
This movie is his dream,
and it's falling apart.

186
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:50,598
Yeah, that's Mexico
showbiz for you.

187
00:08:57,338 --> 00:09:00,308
Oh, is nothing
on this movie real?

188
00:09:00,341 --> 00:09:02,109
Are you okay?

189
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:03,377
Okay?

190
00:09:03,411 --> 00:09:07,281
I'm a total fraud who can't make
a single decision.

191
00:09:07,315 --> 00:09:09,950
Well, maybe you just need
to start with a small one.

192
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:13,053
Like, what color should
the space monster's blood be,

193
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,655
orange or green?

194
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,790
Both. Neither. I don't know!

195
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:20,127
Just close your eyes,
breathe deeply,

196
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,431
and envision the blood.
What color is it?

197
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,334
Orange.

198
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:28,902
There you go. You decided.

199
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:32,373
Of course, orange!
I knew I was a genius!

200
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:35,309
I did it! I directed a movie!

201
00:09:35,343 --> 00:09:36,977
Well, it's just one decision.

202
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,513
Oh, I'm a nothing.
A phony-baloney.

203
00:09:39,547 --> 00:09:41,749
A no-talent. A zilch.

204
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:46,254
Just my luck to work for the
only insecure person in showbiz.

205
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:49,723
You risked everything you have
to tell this story.

206
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,359
It must be special.

207
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:54,328
Maybe I can do this
with your help.

208
00:09:54,362 --> 00:09:57,865
How would you like to be
assistant to the director?

209
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:58,932
Really?

210
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:01,569
I need you to help me
be decisive.

211
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:04,338
No, wait, I don't want that!
Oh, God, which one?

212
00:10:04,372 --> 00:10:06,740
- The first, the first.
- You're hired.

213
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:12,346
Add more dynamite.

214
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,583
Those explosives are
really close to those extras.

215
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,184
So? We got plenty of them.

216
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,453
That's why they're called
extras, right?

217
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:26,594
You tell that lox
to go to acting school

218
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,597
and work there as a janitor.

219
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,233
Krusty loves what you're doing.
Same energy, little quicker.

220
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:35,869
Tell him to sod off.

221
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,138
He says, you got it, baby.

222
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:41,241
It's so much pressure.
The whole movie depends on it.

223
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:43,877
Tell the story
that needs to be told.

224
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:45,413
That butt double
for the action scene,

225
00:10:45,446 --> 00:10:48,316
that butt double for the
love scene. Let's make art!

226
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:51,552
Sorry I'm late,

227
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:54,555
but Krusty and I were
storyboarding tomorrow's shots.

228
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:59,293
Close-up, medium, long, long,
establishing, close,

229
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:03,464
POV, wide, and then,
get this, medium.

230
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:06,967
You've been so busy with
that director, I never see you.

231
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,070
Krusty needs me.
He's under so much pressure.

232
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:13,574
You wouldn't believe how much
directing dust he's sniffing.

233
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:15,243
Everyone's working hard.

234
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:18,212
We had to repaint all the sets
black and white for a flashback.

235
00:11:18,246 --> 00:11:19,880
We wouldn't have been
able to do it

236
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,649
if not for all the crew powder.

237
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,251
Well, it'll all be worth it

238
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:25,353
when this movie touches
people's hearts,

239
00:11:25,386 --> 00:11:29,223
as Peabo Bryson sings
the theme song over the credits.

240
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:30,991
You got Peabo?

241
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,194
- Well, he hasn't committed.
- He's not the only one.

242
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:36,163
This was supposed to be
a romantic adventure,

243
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,166
but whenever we have a moment
alone, your beeper goes off.

244
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:43,237
Why don't we have
a romantic adventure right now?

245
00:11:43,271 --> 00:11:45,406
Oh, yeah, baby.

246
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:51,612
Wahh-wahh.

247
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,286
Where were you?

248
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:02,089
I had to watch the dailies
without you.

249
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:04,358
Greetings. Welcome.

250
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:08,195
Greetings. Welcome.
Greetings. Welcome. Greetings.

251
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,198
I've been going back and forth
all night. Which is better?

252
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,268
Did you get one with Hello?

253
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,906
I'm sorry, I was with Homer,
my boyfriend.

254
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:22,242
Boyfriend? You can't have
a boyfriend. I want you!

255
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:23,477
Krusty!

256
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:25,245
Not like a lady.

257
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,617
Like a mother slash therapist
slash rabbi who xeroxes things.

258
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,151
Dump the boyfriend.

259
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:36,156
I believe in this movie, but I
also believe in Homer and Marge.

260
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,960
Me, I'm Marge.

261
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:43,764
Oh, yes, Marge.
Marge, I knew that.

262
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:46,934
Marge. Marge.

263
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:50,438
I'm not going to break up
with Homer. He's my soul mate.

264
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:53,407
You know what? I get it.

265
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:55,743
Your life has to come first.

266
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:59,113
Yet again, you're the only one
who can set me straight.

267
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:02,216
- Thank you.
- That's all right.

268
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,951
It's not all right.

269
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:06,420
I'm gonna grind
that boyfriend down finer

270
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:09,056
than this movie's red sand...

271
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,259
that I now wish
was sand-colored.

272
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:13,561
Send in my anesthesiologist

273
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:15,496
so I can take a nap.

274
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:17,431
Dreams or no dreams?

275
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:19,400
Surprise me.

276
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:29,377
Wow, it's crazy, man, right?

277
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,080
How narcissism and insecurity
go hand in hand?

278
00:13:32,113 --> 00:13:33,881
I mean, you couldn't function

279
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,916
because your assistant
had a boyfriend.

280
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,451
Where does that jealousy
come from?

281
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:39,153
How would I know?
I fired my shrink

282
00:13:39,187 --> 00:13:42,323
after I found out she was seeing
other patients. Anyway...

283
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:44,325
I made sure the boyfriend

284
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:47,295
had all the most dangerous jobs
on the set.

285
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:50,164
I'm out of breakfast burritos.

286
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:58,639
Bring in the stunt dummy.

287
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,215
Perfect. Let's get
one more for safety.

288
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:12,920
I'm telling you, your crazy boss
is out to get me.

289
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:16,090
No, he's not.
Krusty loves our relationship.

290
00:14:16,124 --> 00:14:18,026
Every day,
he says it would be a shame

291
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:22,163
if something happened to you,
then laughs and laughs.

292
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:24,999
Then why are they sending me out
to the middle of the desert

293
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:28,036
to find a lizard for a new scene
about a space lizard?

294
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:30,604
That does sound
a little dangerous.

295
00:14:30,638 --> 00:14:33,507
No, I'm sure it's super safe.

296
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,077
I'll see you
when I get back alive.

297
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:46,187
Here, lizard, lizard, lizard.

298
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,988
Who wants to be famous?

299
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:49,890
Look at all those skeletons.

300
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:52,726
Mexicans sure love Halloween.

301
00:14:54,062 --> 00:14:57,065
D'oh! What the...?

302
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:04,505
Wha...

303
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:06,974
Oh, I'm trapped in a ravine.

304
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,212
Only one thing to do,
wait patiently for death.

305
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:15,749
- Dad, wake up!
- What?

306
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:17,385
Yeah, get up, fat-ass.

307
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:19,587
Who the hell are you,
talking cactuses?

308
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,555
We're the kids
you're never gonna have

309
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:24,192
if you don't you get your
lazy butt out of that hole.

310
00:15:24,225 --> 00:15:27,095
And technically, it's cacti.

311
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:31,899
Why should I climb out of here
and have you?

312
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:35,169
Marge spends all her time
taking care of that needy clown.

313
00:15:35,203 --> 00:15:37,671
I thought I was
her passion project.

314
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:40,040
You know, someday
you might appreciate a wife

315
00:15:40,074 --> 00:15:41,942
who's developed
empathy and patience

316
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,212
for chubby, selfish men.

317
00:15:44,245 --> 00:15:46,747
Look at that bald guy.

318
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,183
He's so bald!

319
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:50,618
I don't think
we'll ever be born.

320
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:52,620
Sorry, Maggie.

321
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:54,588
Eat my thorns.

322
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:56,124
Why, you prickly...!

323
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:09,737
A casa. I'm saved.

324
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,741
Ay, caramba!

325
00:16:15,343 --> 00:16:19,079
The Pain Lords forced me to mine
every quarry on this planet,

326
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:23,517
but they never imagined
I had the Love Gem all along.

327
00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:27,155
And... cut.

328
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:30,124
That was amazing.

329
00:16:30,158 --> 00:16:32,059
And you remembered
all your lines.

330
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,395
Aw, thanks...

331
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:36,230
Marge.

332
00:16:36,264 --> 00:16:39,099
You've helped me become
what every director should be.

333
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:42,170
An amiable guy
who makes everyone suffer

334
00:16:42,203 --> 00:16:44,071
through his hellish process.

335
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:45,973
Homer's been kidnapped.

336
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,242
There's a note.

337
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:53,814
We have taken
your blubbering coward.

338
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:02,156
The ransom is $1 million

339
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,159
or 100 Los Angeles Raiders
season tickets.

340
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,128
Go, Raiders.

341
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:10,164
Oh, geez, I'm sorry, everyone.

342
00:17:10,198 --> 00:17:12,633
We don't have the cash
to ransom that kid,

343
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,668
but I think I know
what he'd want.

344
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:17,205
A special thanks
in the closing credits

345
00:17:17,238 --> 00:17:20,641
right before which kind
of film stock we used.

346
00:17:20,674 --> 00:17:21,975
Back to work.

347
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:25,279
No. This crew
looks after its own.

348
00:17:25,313 --> 00:17:26,514
We're gonna save Homer,

349
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:30,351
and I don't care how much
golden time they have to pay us.

350
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:36,857
We don't have
a million-dollar ransom,

351
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,459
but we do have one thing.

352
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,228
Movie magic.

353
00:17:40,261 --> 00:17:42,330
Powder up, everyone.

354
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:49,803
Ay, ay, ay!

355
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:51,339
Ay ay ay, indeed.

356
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,043
Give us back our P.A.!

357
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:59,647
The Americans, they have weapons
from the future.

358
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,453
These weapons from the future,
they are not real.

359
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:19,233
Stop shooting.
Stop shooting. Cut!

360
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:22,336
Okay, that's a five.

361
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,572
We don't have
your million dollars,

362
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:27,375
but we can give you something
much more valuable.

363
00:18:27,408 --> 00:18:29,176
A Hollywood movie.

364
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:33,080
All we want back is the
lowliest member of our crew.

365
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,849
We could sell it to
the highest bidder at MIFED!

366
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:37,084
You have a deal.

367
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:40,688
No, no! You can't give away
my masterwork.

368
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:44,091
There's a light that shines
from star to star,

369
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:48,362
from soul to soul, connecting
everyone in the universe.

370
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:51,031
Be the man who believes
in those words,

371
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:55,503
and let the light between me and
Homer give life to our universe.

372
00:18:58,306 --> 00:19:01,342
Gentlemen, the film is yours.

373
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:09,417
You're a good man, Krusty.

374
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,185
Only when I'm with you,

375
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:14,688
which is why I never
want to see you again.

376
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:17,091
I want that too.

377
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,793
I've done a lot of interviews,
man, but wow.

378
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:22,863
I am so glad
that Byron Allen canceled.

379
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:25,199
And after that,
my movie career was kaput.

380
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:27,201
I was sent back to kids TV

381
00:19:27,235 --> 00:19:30,971
and never cared about making
anything good ever again.

382
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:34,042
Well, folks, you heard it.
Who could ever forget it?

383
00:19:34,075 --> 00:19:38,379
A heartbreaking story about a
selfish man's one selfless act.

384
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:39,880
Do you like hot cashews

385
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:42,116
but don't have the time
to heat them up?

386
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,486
ShewBlasters is disrupting
the heated nut business.

387
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,955
If the Shew heats, eat it!

388
00:20:00,002 --> 00:20:03,537
- Mom! Dad!
- You guys never told us

389
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:04,805
you worked on a movie
together.

390
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,274
So that's why
you've been wearing

391
00:20:06,307 --> 00:20:08,109
that crew jacket
all these years.

392
00:20:08,142 --> 00:20:11,045
That crazy movie? Oh, man,
that was a long time ago.

393
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,546
We were just kids.

394
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,781
What was it like?

395
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:15,516
Well, working on
that movie set

396
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,852
turned out to be
a lot like our marriage.

397
00:20:17,886 --> 00:20:20,955
Long days, stupid fights
you don't remember,

398
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:22,957
but damn good breakfasts.

399
00:20:22,991 --> 00:20:25,793
A good breakfast
can get you through a lot.

400
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:28,963
But what happened to the movie?
Did Krusty ever see it?

401
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:30,899
I don't know.
I guess we'll never know.

402
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,036
The love crystal
is whole once more.

403
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:39,507
The prophecy is fulfilled.

404
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:54,188
- What? Why are they laughing?
- They think it's a comedy.

405
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:58,759
It was supposed to show
how we're all connected.

406
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:03,064
Look around, man.
Maybe it did, maybe it did.

407
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:06,200
If you think this is closure,
you're nuts.
