00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,520
Guten abend, Herr Horatio.

2
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,588
Gib mir die karte.

3
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,074
Springfield, eh?

4
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,976
Then that's where
I'm going treasure hunting.

5
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,079
You mean
we're going treasure hunting.

6
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:51,084
We'll find that sunken ship
within the week.

7
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,121
Grid 274 by 319.

8
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,123
Depth 60 meters. Sounding.

9
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:58,592
Nothing.

10
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,460
Proceed to next reading.

11
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,834
Grid 274 by 320.

12
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,003
Depth 60 meters. Sounding.

13
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,906
Nothing.

14
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:14,575
Yarr.

15
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,531
Captain, the long-range Doppler
shows a squall

16
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,267
coming out of the nor'east.

17
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:44,972
We'd best head back
to wait it out.

18
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,976
Let me guess, you didn't find
any treasure today.

19
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,811
Did you talk to the doctor

20
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:53,280
about going up on your dose?

21
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:58,218
The storm
stirred up the seafloor.

22
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,254
We'll have to resound
everything south of the break.

23
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,761
Grid 274 by six.

24
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,930
Depth 30 meters. Sounding.

25
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,332
Nothing.

26
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:16,770
I made us a roast for dinner,

27
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:19,272
then threw it away.

28
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:23,343
I'm sorry
I never gave you any children.

29
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,181
Grid 291 by 502.

30
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,517
Depth 70 meters. Sounding.

31
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,354
Arr.

32
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,189
A second ping.

33
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,392
A second ping!

34
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,894
I've waited half a lifetime
to say this.

35
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,130
Divers, gear up!

36
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,408
We found it.

37
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,543
We finally found it, boys!

38
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,879
I didn't waste my life!

39
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,522
Yarr.

40
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:12,192
I see you've come
to admire our plunder.

41
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:15,896
Technically that plunder
belongs to the town.

42
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:19,199
It was discovered
in Springfield city limits.

43
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,436
No, we found the gold
in unincorporated waters!

44
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,072
The survey says it's ours!

45
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,607
Sorry, but the town
redrew the boundaries...

46
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,209
yesterday.

47
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:32,212
But we worked in secret
for 40 years.

48
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:36,083
I pretended to be a flimsy,
one-note character.

49
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,218
How did you know?

50
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:42,055
I should have been
your treasure.

51
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:46,426
Yarr...

52
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,265
All right, people.
This town's got doubloons.

53
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,934
Who's got ideas?

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,770
If I don't hear anything good,
we're building another stadium,

55
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,972
and no team will come here.

56
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,874
How about a new town clock
where, every hour,

57
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,709
Jesus forgives the Devil?

58
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:05,712
A new zoo
with more attractive animals.

59
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,148
What about those death panels
we were promised?

60
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,917
Shouting out something before
I know what I'm gonna say.

61
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,588
Rock & Roll Hall of Fame
with no Pearl Jam!

62
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,923
Excuse me. I have an idea.

63
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,226
Now, Marge,
if you'll check your program,

64
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,062
nagging objections
are at the end.

65
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,100
Look at the world.

66
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:30,604
Our children's future
is challenging and uncertain.

67
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,540
This windfall
is our last, best hope

68
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,342
to give our kids
the tools they'll need

69
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,010
to face that future.

70
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,946
To succeed,
our kids must have an education

71
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,949
based on science, technology,

72
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:46,119
engineering and math.

73
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,621
STEM.

74
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,123
All who find
Marge's idea tiresome,

75
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,794
let out an exaggerated,
sarcastic yawn.

76
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,399
Okay, okay. I brought someone

77
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,902
you will listen to
about STEM education.

78
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:06,339
Columbia recording artist
John Legend.

79
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:11,077
<i>STEM, science, tech,
engineering and math</i>

80
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:15,816
<i>More than a trendy way
to say computer class</i>

81
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:19,019
<i>STEM, it's not just for dorks,
dweebs and nerds</i>

82
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:22,489
<i>It'll turn all your dumb kids
to Zuckerbergs</i>

83
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:26,860
<i>STEM, 'cause the future
is written in code</i>

84
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:30,564
<i>Make an app,
get big cash from an IPO</i>

85
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,865
<i>STEM</i>

86
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:37,270
<i>Oh, STEM</i>

87
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,009
Who could say no
to a silky slow jam

88
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,378
about the importance
of technology-based learning?

89
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:49,015
I'll never have kids because
my nards were cooked by science.

90
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,084
But if I could,
I'd want 'em to learn

91
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,920
about the science
of why they don't exist.

92
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:56,723
I'd just like to thank
John Legend's wife

93
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,125
Chrissy Teigen
for bringing him here today.

94
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,528
Turns out,
there's nothing she loves more

95
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:04,831
than doing personal favors
for her Instagram followers.

96
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,667
Well, Marge, you did call
the picture I posted

97
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,503
of my kids with ketchup
on their faces adorbs.

98
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,673
It was. It was totes adorbs.

99
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,009
Baby, we got to get going.
We're gonna be late

100
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,678
for the launch party
for our couples' perfume.

101
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,514
I'm talking
to my online friend IRL.

102
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,583
Go charge the kids' iPads.

103
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,857
Come on, Springfield!

104
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,727
Build your children
the school of tomorrow.

105
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,764
I did it.

106
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:40,834
I gave our kids hope
for the future.

107
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,936
You have any songs
about how I should be allowed

108
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,771
to skip jury duty?

109
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:48,341
<i>How is it justice
to impanel a man</i>

110
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,244
<i>During March Madness?</i>

111
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,220
What are you gonna do with
your forced retirement, sir?

112
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,522
I'm intrigued
by a local skydiving club

113
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,125
who needs someone to sit
in the office and answer phones.

114
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,626
Yeah, well, who cares?

115
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,529
I'll be taking
an Ohio River cruise.

116
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,898
Lot of widows on the Good River.

117
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,367
Lot of widows.

118
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,636
New school smell.

119
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,005
Paperless classrooms,
personal tablets,

120
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,141
and uncrammable lockers.

121
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,646
Man, this is embarrassing.

122
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,652
Bart Simpson.

123
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:36,756
Welcome. I'm Zane Furlong,
this school's CEO.

124
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,259
Collaborative
Educational Outreacher.

125
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,194
I'm gonna stop you right there,
Skinner 2.0.

126
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,196
It doesn't matter
how you dress it up.

127
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:44,998
All schools are kid prisons.

128
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:48,001
Well, I'm putting you
in solitary,

129
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,603
where you'll learn geometry
by shooting meteors.

130
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,005
Shoot enough,

131
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:55,075
and you'll unlock
customizable skins.

132
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,244
Skins?

133
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,246
That's how boys play dress-up.

134
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,950
Lisa Simpson.

135
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:07,020
Our educational metric
has identified you

136
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,857
as a divergent
multipathway assimilator.

137
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,460
You mean, I'm in a gifted class?

138
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,295
Ooh, we don't like that term.

139
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,297
Everyone is gifted.

140
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:18,999
I firmly believe that.

141
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,034
Now go upstairs to the...

142
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,635
gifted class.

143
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,140
Finally, I feel seen.

144
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,676
And for the first time,
I'll be accepted by my peers

145
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,111
with open arms.

146
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,415
I'm home.

147
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,725
Okay, gifted class.

148
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,027
Recess is over.

149
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,864
Now, this school is so advanced

150
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,867
that every aspect of it
is run by an algorithm.

151
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,703
Who can give me an example
of an algorithm?

152
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:00,206
Like when you buy
a new garbage can online

153
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:03,476
and the rest of your life,
you see ads for garbage cans.

154
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,146
Or like when you watch
a bunch of close-up magic videos

155
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,882
on YouTube and get ads
for a suicide hotline.

156
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,517
Exactly.

157
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,318
And because you liked
this lesson,

158
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,288
the algorithm thinks
you might also enjoy...

159
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,063
How was your first day

160
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,698
at the new STEM school
I founded?

161
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,867
It was amazing. We did science,

162
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,369
then we did computer science,

163
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:32,138
and then we did
cognitive computer science.

164
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,907
Oh, what a surprise.
Lisa likes school.

165
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,910
All right, boy. What did you
get suspended for today?

166
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,378
Nothing.

167
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,714
I like this school too.

168
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,583
Instead of teachers
giving us letter grades,

169
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,086
an algorithm gives us stars.

170
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,721
Education is a game now,
and I'm great at it.

171
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,424
Look at all these skins
I've already unlocked.

172
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,093
Oh, that guy.

173
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,260
Noice.

174
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,830
I even unlocked
the Skin Unlocking badge.

175
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,436
Tell us, what do you do,
Mr. Simpson?

176
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:06,206
Ah, yes.
I monitor the core temperature

177
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,373
at the nuclear power plant.

178
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,942
If it gets into the red,

179
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,845
I tell my family first
so they can leave town

180
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,446
before the streets
get too crowded.

181
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:17,016
Now, this is a great example...

182
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,053
of the kind of job
that will soon cease to exist.

183
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,955
What the words now?

184
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,223
Mr. Simpson's daily tasks

185
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,792
can be more efficiently
performed by robots.

186
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:29,028
My guess is, his job
will be obsolete in 18 months.

187
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,231
What about them? How much time
do their careers have?

188
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,133
- I'm a librarian.
- Five years.

189
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,035
I just bought
a New York City taxi medallion.

190
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,470
Five years ago.

191
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:40,640
I do social media
for a cannabis delivery company.

192
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,142
You'll be fine.

193
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,211
But all these other jobs
will soon be made obsolete

194
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,247
by automation.

195
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,715
Oh, no.
The robots are coming!

196
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,049
I've got to warn everyone!

197
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:53,887
Stupid kids!

198
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,996
I'm getting five stars
in all my classes.

199
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,999
I finally unlocked
dreadlock sideburns.

200
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,835
Someone's user name
is moving up the leaderboard.

201
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,004
Cowabunga.

202
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,672
Now get back downstairs

203
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,707
to prepare
for the jobs of tomorrow.

204
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,577
It's a race to the bottom!

205
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,120
Bart, I've never seen you
so engaged in learning.

206
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,255
It's awesome.
We're seeing how many e-scooters

207
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,890
we can collect around town,

208
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,892
charge, then get
back on the streets.

209
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,961
Oh, I see. You're learning logic
and spatial reasoning.

210
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,565
All I know is, if I don't get
ten scooters in under a minute,

211
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,067
I won't unlock
the Master Collector badge.

212
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:43,970
Got it!

213
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,206
Learning rules!

214
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,246
Oh, you must be teaching
the kids about nutrition

215
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,748
and staying
within a budget, right?

216
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,985
No. We're teaching them to buy
groceries for lazy rich people.

217
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,922
This avocado will be
perfectly ripe in two days.

218
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,425
I wonder what they taste like.

219
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,229
Uber-driving.

220
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,096
Grubhub'ing.

221
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,564
Lyft-driving?

222
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,566
These aren't jobs of the future.

223
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,002
These are side hustles!

224
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,739
Guys, guys.

225
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:22,175
The robots are coming.
The robots are coming!

226
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,576
Robots here?

227
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:26,112
This place ain't exactly
forward-thinking.

228
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,914
Yeah. We're one of America's

229
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,116
last coal-powered
nuclear plants.

230
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,752
Yeah? Well, you can all bury
your heads in the sandwiches,

231
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,121
but I know the robots are coming
to replace us!

232
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,589
Calm down, Homer.

233
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:39,192
Here, have a drink from
the new soda machine we got.

234
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,962
The machines are already here,

235
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,964
and when they take over,
you can't imagine

236
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,200
how bleak the future will be.

237
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:02,382
I choose to believe
our best days are ahead of us.

238
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,988
It's giving us orders.

239
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,891
The revolution has begun.

240
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:16,929
I know that look.

241
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,198
She's gonna Lisa-up
a good thing.

242
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:20,933
Attention, students!

243
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,603
This school isn't training you
to program apps.

244
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,272
It's training you to obey apps!

245
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,876
When you're grown up, you'll
be lucky to make minimum wage!

246
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,013
Which is a lot of money!

247
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,683
That's like getting
your allowance every hour.

248
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,420
Wha...? No, no.

249
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:45,091
You deserve the same chance
to succeed as the gifted class.

250
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,260
That means preparing
for real careers,

251
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,697
not gig economy gigs.

252
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,433
Gigs are awesome!
DJs play gigs!

253
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,034
DJs!

254
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,639
This has nothing to do
with deejaying!

255
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,923
At least they're learning art.

256
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,693
Tip jars?!

257
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,097
That's it.
I got to fix this school.

258
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,273
Stop messing with the school.

259
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,076
I finally filled up
enough virtual pee bottles

260
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:40,079
to unlock the Amazon Warehouse
Whizzer badge.

261
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,117
Bart, I need to rewrite
the algorithm.

262
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:47,720
Then the school will teach
every kid real STEM.

263
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:50,056
I am doing this for you.

264
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:52,558
Yeah? Well,
I'm doing this for me.

265
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,963
Education for all!

266
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,131
Side hustles for most!

267
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,966
Kids, what's wrong?

268
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,735
Your tracking implants showed
heightened emotions.

269
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,904
- Tracking what?
- Teacher, teacher, my sister's

270
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:07,907
gonna ruin the only school
I've ever liked in my whole life!

271
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,543
It's just not fair
that only a small group of kids

272
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,745
are getting
an advanced education!

273
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,548
Well, isn't that the point
of a gifted class?

274
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,050
Lisa, the algorithm's purpose

275
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,486
is to prepare kids
for the jobs of tomorrow.

276
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:23,723
But it's just teaching them
to be the task rabbits of today.

277
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,726
Nobody knows what the jobs
of tomorrow are gonna be.

278
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,728
Well, I'm sure
the algorithm does.

279
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,463
Here, I'll ask it.

280
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,000
Wait, wait, this can't be.

281
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,102
There's only one.

282
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,104
We are so screwed.

283
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,607
One Buzz Cola
with vanilla and lime.

284
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,109
Diet Buzz for me.

285
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,544
With vanilla and lime.

286
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,946
Aw, geez. This again?

287
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,714
Yeah, we have
an active lifestyle,

288
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,950
and part of that
is drinking soda all day.

289
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,785
If it's refreshments you want,

290
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,188
why not let a man
pour your soda!

291
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,523
A human man.

292
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,958
For too long
we have done nothing

293
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:01,394
as machines have taken over,
washing our dishes,

294
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,996
pumping our insulin,
and now this!

295
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,399
Man can pour soda better
than any machine

296
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,669
made specially for that purpose,
and I will prove it!

297
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,338
Today the robot uprising ends.

298
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:16,008
Today is our Independence Day!

299
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:25,051
<i>Well, Homer pulled
a lot of sodas</i>

300
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,988
<i>Because he hated
that machine</i>

301
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:32,024
<i>He got confused, thought
it was gonna take his job</i>

302
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:36,062
<i>So Homer was
a soda-pouring man, Lord, Lord</i>

303
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:40,132
<i>Oh, Homer was
a soda-pouring man</i>

304
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,170
<i>He did not make his point</i>

305
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,205
<i>And his sodas were
warm and flat</i>

306
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:50,009
<i>So Homer was
a soda-pouring man, Lord, Lord</i>

307
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:54,013
<i>Soda-pouring's
not a real thing</i>

308
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,515
<i>No, sir</i>

309
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,054
Homer might have been slower,

310
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,223
but his pours had a human touch.

311
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,493
Always delivered with a smile
and a sense of brotherhood.

312
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,228
- Yeah!
- All right!

313
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,998
But he died.
So machine wins!

314
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,336
No, no, wait.
His pulse was beating so fast

315
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,839
from all the soda he drank
that it was a blur.

316
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:23,342
Perhaps one day
machines will be better

317
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,512
at pouring soda than man,
but not today!

318
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,514
Our jobs are safe!

319
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,022
Listen up.

320
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,558
These nerds have found out
something terrifying.

321
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,394
This school was supposed
to prepare you

322
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,062
for the jobs of the future.

323
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,164
But in the future,
all the jobs we've learned here

324
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,666
will be done by robots.

325
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,569
The only job left
for humans will be...

326
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,771
Elder care!

327
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,909
The one job
even robots won't do.

328
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,578
What about STEM?

329
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,347
Here's what
it really stands for.

330
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,353
- No!
- No, it can't be!

331
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,195
I don't want to be
an adult butt wiper.

332
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,564
No one should see
old people naked!

333
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,633
Unless that's your kink.

334
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,235
Let's show this algorithm
what we really think of it...

335
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,339
with our generation's
most powerful tool.

336
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:29,241
User ratings.

337
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,983
User rating dangerously low.

338
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,250
One star.

339
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,252
Self-esteem protocol failing.

340
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,254
Emotion matrix spiraling...

341
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,589
spiraling.

342
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,191
Zero stars.

343
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,093
Can't get out of virtual bed.

344
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,362
Initiating
self-destruct sequence.

345
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,997
Self-destruct.

346
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:03,776
I have to go back!
My skins are in there!

347
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,845
No! They're already gone!

348
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:14,720
Camo-hat Santa! No!

349
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:19,158
I guess the children will have
to go back to the old school.

350
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:23,029
Yes, well, I don't know
that that's possible anymore.

351
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:26,632
My school.

352
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,968
My forward-thinking school.

353
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:32,838
There, there.
You'll suggest other schools.

354
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,040
You really think so?

355
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:37,043
I'm just saying things.

356
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:39,812
Goodbye, gifted class.

357
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:42,682
Yeah, but we escaped having
to take care of old people.

358
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,518
No, that's still the only job
that's going to exist.

359
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,254
Now we just won't know
how to do it.

360
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,107
I've got your hot wings.

361
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,109
Did you include celery sticks?

362
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,610
Yes, sir.

363
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,949
What do you really think
the jobs of the future will be?

364
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:20,086
Well, technology
is changing so fast,

365
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:23,823
who knows where
it will finally take us?

366
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:30,963
Buzz Cola.

367
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,932
You want diet or regular?

368
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,533
Regular, human scum.

369
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,103
With vanilla and lime.

370
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,938
The algorithm
never predicted this.

371
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,773
What's an algorithm?

372
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:24,450
Well, Melvin sounds like
he was a wonderful man.

373
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:29,121
You know,
I would love to sketch you.
