1
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:06,506
The Simpsons.

2
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,037
Oh, damn F.D.A.
Why can't it all be marshmallow?

3
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,956
Ew, Bart, don't put
the non-marshmallow pieces

4
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,333
back in the box,
they go in the trash.

5
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,794
Ooh, you like sweets,
kids?

6
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,380
I know a place that's sweeter
than sweetness itself.

7
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,757
In this sweet place,

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,759
earthly doughnuts
are sour as poison.

9
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,304
You'd spit them out,
you would.

10
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:59,434
I'm talking about
the candy industry trade show.

11
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,852
How did you get tickets?

12
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,979
They hid them in every millionth
Krusty Klump Bar

13
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,689
and Krusty
Klump Bar with almonds.

14
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,863
Hey, Hey, Hey!

15
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,741
I have asked you nicely
not to mangle my merchandise.

16
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,077
You leave me no choice
but to ask you nicely again.

17
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,513
Can I come
to the candy show?

18
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,748
- No! Me! Me!
- Huh? Can I?

19
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,875
Sorry kids, but this
is the one event

20
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,586
I want my darling wife
by my side.

21
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,506
Oh, well, thank you, Homer,
but take one of the kids.

22
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,008
Marge, they can't carry
enough candy.

23
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,968
They have
puny little muscles.

24
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,929
Not big, ropy ones
like you.

25
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,058
You go, Mom,
for the greater good.

26
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,434
For the greater good.

27
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:45,063
Homer, are all
these pockets necessary?

28
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,026
They wouldn't be if you were willing
to sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair.

29
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,485
That's the baby-sitter.

30
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,779
No one in town will
sit for you two anymore.

31
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,799
I had to choose between
a grad student at the university

32
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,533
and a scary-looking hobo.

33
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,160
Please the hobo,
please the hobo, please the hobo.

34
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,371
Hi. I'm Ashley Grant.

35
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,040
Ashley Grant!

36
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,042
You gave a talk on women's
issues at my school

37
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,586
on how we don't have
to be second-class citizens.

38
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,297
Mom, how can you leave us
with this maniac?

39
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,981
Hurry, Marge! If we get there early,
we can get our pictures taken

40
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,593
with the two surviving
musketeers.

41
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,595
There's also a baby
somewhere upstairs.

42
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,599
So, you're one of those

43
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,310
"don't call me a chick"
chicks, huh?

44
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,063
Sorry about
my unenlightened brother.

45
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,899
He will make the next few hours
a living hell.

46
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,109
Oh, I don't know.

47
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,778
See this, Bart?

48
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,738
Disemboweler IV.

49
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,782
The game where condemned
criminals

50
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,909
dig at each other
with rusty hooks.

51
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,828
Do a little housework,

52
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,231
and you can
play for five minutes.

53
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,914
No way.

54
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,001
Yes'm.

55
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,003
See, Lisa?
Males aren't hard to tame.

56
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,881
They all follow their
video cartridges.

57
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,434
Mr. Goodbar to the front desk.

58
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,312
The front desk is looking
for Mr. Goodbar.

59
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:11,524
I feel like a kid
in some kind of a store.

60
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,277
Yeah! Ooh!

61
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,528
Great.

62
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,281
Exquisite.

63
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,574
Oh, you'll do well.

64
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,618
Give me those.

65
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,913
As you can see, I have created
a lemon ball so sour

66
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,625
it can only be safely contained
in a magnetic field.

67
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,670
The candy,
known as 77-X-42...

68
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,297
Where the hell
is the candy?

69
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,423
I don't know.

70
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,760
Hey, sir, try our wax lips.

71
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,428
It's the candy
of 1,000 uses.

72
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,846
Like what?

73
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,807
One, a humorous substitute
for your own lips.

74
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,685
- Keep going.
- Two, uh...

75
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,104
Ooh, I'm needed in the basement.

76
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,079
You're going to have
to put some sugar

77
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,248
on that celery or get out, ma'am.

78
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,046
Ooh, Gummi Bears,
Gummi Calves' Heads,

79
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,631
Gummi Jaw Breakers.

80
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,931
What's that?

81
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,350
That is the rarest
Gummi of them all.

82
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,102
The Gummi Venus de Milo.

83
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,062
Carved by Gummi artisans

84
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:34,232
who work exclusively
in the medium of Gummi.

85
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,067
Will you two stop
saying Gummi so much?

86
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,196
Must have rare Gummi.

87
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,864
Distract the salesman.

88
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,108
No, I won't make a spectacle
out of myself any further.

89
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,913
Oh! Whoa! Oh!

90
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,498
How'd they get there?

91
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,047
Now, this is going to take
all my skill.

92
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,217
Halt, halt!

93
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,261
Run, Marge!

94
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,429
Save the booty!

95
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,347
After him!
He has the Gummi!

96
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,822
See you in hell, candy boys!

97
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,004
Hey, Lise, I found
a big caramel deposit

98
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,005
at the small of her back.

99
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,173
I'm coming.

100
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:46,928
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

101
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,115
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

102
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,182
Where's my Gummi de Milo?

103
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,683
Okay, don't panic.

104
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,809
She can't have gotten far.

105
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,144
She has no arms.

106
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,562
I'm sure it'll turn up.

107
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,356
Take the baby-sitter home now.

108
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,316
She's been sitting
in the car for 20 minutes.

109
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,399
Relax Marge, there's plenty
for her to do in there.

110
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,614
See? She's having
the time of her life.

111
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,493
So, a graduate student, huh?

112
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,036
How come you guys
can go to the moon

113
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,662
but you can't make
my shoes smell good?

114
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,998
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, nobody's blaming you.

115
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,762
Hey, would you take
the wheel for a second,

116
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,752
I have to scratch myself
in two places at once.

117
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,587
Just drop me off here.

118
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,552
Precious Venus.

119
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,059
Thank you.

120
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:46,072
Hey, kids, lots of candy
left for breakfast.

121
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,993
Why don't we give it
to some needy children then?

122
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,077
No.

123
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,002
Oh no, the candy conventioneers
tracked us down.

124
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,966
There he is... there's the man
that sexually harassed me.

125
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:08,094
Oh, for a minute there,
I thought I was in big trouble.

126
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,679
It's just a... D'oh!

127
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:15,852
2-4-6-8,
Homer's crime was very great.

128
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,187
Great meaning large or immense.

129
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,731
We use it
in the pejorative sense.

130
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,733
Marge, I swear
I didn't touch her.

131
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,277
You know how bashful I am.

132
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,903
I can't even say
the word "titmouse"

133
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,405
without giggling
like a school girl.

134
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,826
At any rate,
I believe you.

135
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,203
And I think you should go outside
and straighten this out.

136
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,831
Some of their chants are
very catchy and memorable.

137
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,668
You grabbed me
in the car!

138
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,838
Oh that... no. I was just
grabbing a Gummi Venus de Milo

139
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,506
that got stuck
to your pants.

140
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,091
Yeah, right.

141
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,926
That's the oldest
excuse in the book.

142
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,263
Come on, I'm a decent guy.

143
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,481
Why would anybody want
to touch a girl's butt?

144
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,357
That's where
cooties come from.

145
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,776
Dad, I don't understand.
What is she saying you did?

146
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,405
Well Lisa, remember that postcard
Grampa sent us from Florida

147
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,449
of that alligator
biting that woman's bottom?

148
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,410
Oh, yeah!
That was brilliant!

149
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,829
That's right.
We all thought it was hilarious,

150
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,998
but it turns out
we were wrong.

151
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,626
That alligator was
sexually harassing that woman.

152
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,920
And the dog in the Coppertone ads?
Same deal, Dad?

153
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,796
That's kind of a gray area.

154
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,423
We know you're innocent, Dad.

155
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,674
Thanks, kids.

156
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,092
They seem to be building

157
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,261
some sort of a shanty town.

158
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,603
Do your worst, protesters.

159
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,356
You can't stop me
from living my life.

160
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,358
No respect for women,
no peace.

161
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,235
Just try to push
the right buttons now.

162
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,612
We aren't crazy about
nuclear power either!

163
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,656
You people aren't
allowed in here.

164
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,658
It's okay.
They're with me.

165
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,834
They're ruining
my whole life.

166
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,796
Marge, please, this is where
I need you the most.

167
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,065
I'm counting on you
to do something

168
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,799
or say something
to make it all better.

169
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,842
Okay... go.

170
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,220
Homer...

171
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:17,682
I already talked to the indignation
coordinator out on the lawn today.

172
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,046
I told her you were a decent man,
but she wouldn't listen.

173
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,781
Besides standing by you
and supporting you,

174
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,163
there isn't anything
more I can do.

175
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,273
You mean I'm on my own?

176
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,941
I've never been on my own.

177
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,943
Oh, no, on own... on own...

178
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,988
I need help.
Oh, God, help me.

179
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,489
Help me, God!

180
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,788
Ye-llo?

181
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:44,417
Hello, Homer.
This is God... frey Jones

182
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,335
from the TV magazine
show Rock Bottom.

183
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,462
We're aware of your problems,

184
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,840
and, Mr. Simpson,
we want to help.

185
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,884
Mmm. I saw that report
you did on Sasquatch.

186
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,429
It was fair and even-handed.

187
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,763
I'll do it!

188
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,599
Somebody had to take
the baby-sitter home.

189
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,643
Then I noticed she was sitting
on the Gummi Venus,

190
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,270
so I grabbed it off her.

191
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:08,399
Oh, just thinking
about that sweet, sweet candy...

192
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,447
I just wish
I had another one right now.

193
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,865
But the most
important thing is...

194
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,617
That was really
great, Mr. Simpson.

195
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,035
We got everything we need.

196
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,746
Okay. Say, can you introduce
me to the Sasquatch?

197
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,581
I like his style.

198
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,336
He-he!

199
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,255
Here comes the bouncing
ball of justice!

200
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,965
Tonight on Rock Bottom,

201
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,594
we go undercover at a sex farm
for sex hookers.

202
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,930
I keep telling you,
I just grow sorghum here.

203
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,849
Uh-huh, and where are
the hookers?

204
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,435
Round back. Oops.

205
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,978
But first...

206
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,122
She was a university
honors student

207
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,814
who devoted her life to kids

208
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,816
until the night
a grossly overweight pervert

209
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,237
named Homer Simpson gave her
a crash course in depravity.

210
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,864
"Baby-sitter and the Beast."

211
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,783
Aw, crap!

212
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,868
Somebody had to take
the baby-sitter home.

213
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,829
Then I noticed she was
sitting on her sweet can...

214
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,873
so I grabbed her sweet can.

215
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,334
Oh, just thinking
about her can...

216
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,629
I just wish I had her sweet,
sweet, s-s-sweet can.

217
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,799
So, Mr. Simpson, you admit
you grabbed her can?

218
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,801
What do you have to say
in your defense?

219
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:22,306
Mr. Simpson, your silence will
only incriminate you further.

220
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,517
No, Mr. Simpson.
Don't take your anger out on me!

221
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,937
Get back! Get back!
Mr. Simpson, no!

222
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,540
Dramatization...
May not have happened.

223
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,653
Marge, kids, everything's
going to be just fine.

224
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,280
Now go upstairs
and pack your bags.

225
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,824
We're going
to start a new life...

226
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,492
under the sea.

227
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,382
Under the sea.

228
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,385
Under the sea.

229
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,762
There'll be no accusations.

230
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,806
Just friendly crustaceans.

231
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,349
Under the sea.

232
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,257
Homer, that's your solution to everything.
To move under the sea.

233
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,074
It's not going to happen!

234
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,285
Not with that attitude.

235
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,328
Look, maybe this whole
thing will blow over.

236
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,878
It didn't blow over, Marge.

237
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,671
Nothing ever blows over for me.

238
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,482
Simpson Scandal update: Homer
sleeps nude in an oxygen tent

239
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,443
which he believes
gives him sexual powers.

240
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,613
Hey, that's a half-truth!

241
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,698
I don't know Homer Simpson.

242
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,617
I never met
Homer Simpson

243
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,497
or had any contact
with him, but...

244
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,248
I'm sorry.
I-I can't go on.

245
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,958
That's okay.

246
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,795
Your tears say more
than real evidence ever could.

247
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,131
Today on Ben...
Mothers and runaway daughters

248
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,551
reunited by their hatred
of Homer Simpson.

249
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,429
And here's your host,
Gentle Ben.

250
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,521
I just have
one thing to say...

251
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,189
Let's have less
Homer Simpsons

252
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,191
and more money
for public schools.

253
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,945
Ben, I have
a question...

254
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,824
No, Ben. No!

255
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,545
And now we return

256
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,255
to Fox Night at the Movies...

257
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,607
Homer S.: Portrait of
an Ass-Grabber.

258
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,341
Starring Dennis Franz.

259
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:06,720
Ooh! Portrait!
Sounds classy.

260
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,264
Doesn't it?

261
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,236
No, Mr. Simpson!
A cat is a living creature.

262
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,821
I don't care.

263
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:31,078
Now, I'm gonna
grab me somethin' sweet!

264
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:34,331
No, Mr. Simpson!
That's sexual harassment.

265
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,917
If you keep it up, I'll yell so
loud the whole country'll hear.

266
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,422
With a man
in the White House?

267
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,673
Not likely.

268
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:50,097
This is hour 57 of our live,
round-the-clock coverage

269
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,099
outside the Simpson Estate.

270
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,994
Remember, by the way,
to tune in tonight at 8:00

271
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,686
for highlights of today's vigil

272
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,354
including when
the garbage man came

273
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,607
and when Marge Simpson
put the cat out...

274
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,970
possibly because
it was harassed.

275
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,444
We don't know.

276
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,547
Of course, there's no way to see
into the Simpson home

277
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,407
without some kind of
infrared heat-sensitive camera.

278
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,492
So, let's turn it on.

279
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,996
Now, this technology is new
to me, but I'm pretty sure

280
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,082
that's Homer Simpson
in the oven rotating slowly.

281
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,377
His body temperature has
risen to over 400 degrees.

282
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,755
He's literally stewing
in his own juices.

283
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,257
Now, here are some results
from our phone-in poll.

284
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,802
95% of the people believe
Homer Simpson is guilty.

285
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,055
Of course, this is just
a television poll

286
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,475
which is not legally binding,
unless Proposition 304 passes,

287
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,060
and we all pray it will.

288
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,521
Aw, I don't have
a friend in the world.

289
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,858
We're Homer's true friends!

290
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,568
Oh, really?

291
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,528
Come on. Let us through,
you vultures.

292
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,573
Oh, Marge, it's a miracle.

293
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,408
How can you judge this man

294
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,370
without talking to the people
who know him best?

295
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,372
We got the real dirt
on Homer Simpson

296
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,666
and the bidding starts at 10 Gs!

297
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,501
- I bid 10 Gs!
- 10-5 Gs!

298
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,294
- Fifteen!
- Fifteen-five!

299
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,047
I need a hug.

300
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,804
How come
you guys hesitated?

301
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,556
Sorry, Dad. We do believe
in you. We really do.

302
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,433
It's just hard not
to listen to TV.

303
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,643
It's spent so
much more time

304
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,894
raising us
than you have.

305
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,064
Oh... maybe TV is right.

306
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,857
TV's always right.

307
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,659
Are you hugging the TV?

308
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,661
No.

309
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:46,046
And the number one reference
that I am running into the ground

310
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,341
is Homer Simpson!

311
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,850
Ay-yi-yi!
Es Homer Simpson!

312
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,811
Me ha molestado! Oh!

313
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,565
Ohh. I like it better
when they're making fun

314
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,567
of people who aren't me.

315
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,777
I know!
Evening at the Improv.

316
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,405
They never talk about anything
beyond the 1980s.

317
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,157
See, I think about weird stuff.

318
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,744
Like, what would happen
if E.T. and Mr. T. Had a baby.

319
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,246
Well, you'd get
Mr. E.T., wouldn't you?

320
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,499
And you know, I think he'd
sound a little something like this.

321
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,126
I pity the fool who doesn't

322
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,004
phone home.

323
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:30,340
Ooh, I wouldn't
want to be Mr. T. Right now.

324
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,593
Homer, the kids
have a great idea

325
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,927
how you can clear
your name!

326
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,055
The media is making
a monster out of you

327
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,490
because they don't care
about the truth.

328
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,224
All they care about
is entertainment.

329
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,119
Well, you need a forum
where they don't even know

330
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,936
the meaning of the word
entertainment.

331
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,855
Public Access television.

332
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,690
Aw, but those shows
all look so crummy.

333
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,609
Well, we can
dress it up a bit.

334
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,737
We can bring a fern,
and a folding chair from the garage

335
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,990
and the most decorative thing
of all... the truth.

336
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,793
There are only 49 stars
on that flag.

337
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,045
I'll be deep in the cold,
cold ground

338
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,963
before I recognize Missouri.

339
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:17,346
Now it's time for the
Innocence Report, with Homer Simpson.

340
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,391
Hello. I am Homer Simpson,

341
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:25,020
or as some of you wags
have dubbed me, "Father Goose."

342
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:29,274
You know, everybody believed
the worst about me right away.

343
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,610
Nobody cares that
I didn't do it.

344
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,403
But I didn't.

345
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,864
Okay, look, I've done
some bad things in my life,

346
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,076
but harassing women
is not one of them.

347
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,995
Like one time
we were having this race

348
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,915
with this stupid old-timey
bicycle with the big wheel in front.

349
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,501
So I figure,
"We'll see about that."

350
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,838
So I get this big chunk
of cinder block, and I...

351
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,549
Oh, got to go.

352
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,008
Innocent.

353
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,095
Dad, you did it.
I am so proud of you.

354
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,680
The switchboards
are lighting up!

355
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,014
Yay!

356
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,307
Two calls.

357
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,226
That's our best ever!

358
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,145
Hello? No, Janice
doesn't live here.

359
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,521
Hello?

360
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,982
Yes, I am interested
in long-distance savings.

361
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,942
Very interested.

362
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,781
Marge, this is
so depressing.

363
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,243
My only hope is this
homemade Prozac.

364
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,954
Mmm... needs
more ice cream.

365
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,252
So, uh, you don't like
the old-time bikes, huh?

366
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,886
Homer, I love amateur video.

367
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:42,681
And your show is the most
amateur video I ever saw.

368
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:46,476
My hobby is secretly
videotaping couples and gals.

369
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,646
I dare not come forward,
because in this country

370
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,274
it makes you look
like a pervert!

371
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,903
But every single Scottish person
does it!

372
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,906
Oh, baby.

373
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,616
Oh, yeah. Oh, baby.

374
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,576
Oh, no. That's Mayor Quimby.

375
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,204
Ah. Here we go.

376
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,789
Precious Venus.

377
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,628
Thank you.

378
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,884
Dad, this clears
you completely!

379
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,761
You know the courts
might not work anymore,

380
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:24,014
but as long as everybody
is videotaping everyone else,

381
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,682
justice will be done.

382
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,228
See?

383
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,730
Hmm. Homer,
I thought you were an animal,

384
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,732
but your daughter said
you were a decent man.

385
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,359
I guess she was right.

386
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,569
You're both right.

387
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,865
In our mad pursuit
of the scoop,

388
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,369
we members of the press
sometimes make mistakes.

389
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,692
Rock Bottom would like to make
the following corrections.

390
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,585
Wow! V-8 juice isn't
one-eighth gasoline.

391
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,421
And Ted Koppel is a robot.

392
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,756
There's you, Dad!

393
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,216
Yay!

394
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,260
Tomorrow, on Rock Bottom...

395
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,512
He's a foreigner who takes
perverted videos of you

396
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,681
when you least suspect it.

397
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,349
He's Rowdy Roddy Peeper.

398
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,020
That man is sick!

399
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,939
Groundskeeper Willie
saved you, Homer.

400
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,316
But listen to the music.
He's evil.

401
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,985
Hasn't this experience
taught you

402
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,903
you can't believe
everything you hear?

403
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:24,574
Marge, my friend,
I haven't learned a thing.

404
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,418
Let's never fight again. Aw...

405
