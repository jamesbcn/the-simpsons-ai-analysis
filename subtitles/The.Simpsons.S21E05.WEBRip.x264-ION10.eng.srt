{\an8}I plan to fill the void

{\an8}a little late

{\an8}for tapping gauges or filling
out employee evaluations.

Whoa!

86
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,536
{\an8}Now, who has ideas

87
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,254
{\an8}for this year's fund-raiser?

88
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,294
{\an8}Well, the police department
raised money

89
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,128
{\an8}by selling
these beefcake calendars.

90
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,263
Ooh, that's quite
a thing.

91
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,339
MRS. SKINNER:
Yeah, great.

92
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,678
{\an8}I have a
great idea.

93
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,016
{\an8}Let's do what they
did but with us.

94
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,022
We are
a good-looking bunch.

00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,904
(excited chatter)

96
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,651
We just need a theme.

97
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:35,942
Hmm.

98
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,695
Ah!

99
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,738
How about history?

100
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,031
(overlapping chatter)

101
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:42,945
Then it's set.

102
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,492
We'll do it on the 25th of...

103
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,735
(groans)

104
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,407
...Wiggum.

105
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,245
(camera shutter clicking)

106
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,380
Okay, Betsy Ross,
bring history to life.

107
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,749
Ooh, I love it.

108
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,046
Don't stop, don't
stop, don't stop.

109
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,589
Okay, stop, we got plenty.

110
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,802
All right, who's my next
sexy historical lady?

111
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:01,883
I am.

112
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,968
The female Tiger Woods
of the 1930s--

113
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,474
Babe Didrikson Zaharias.

114
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,977
Ooh, you know Marge,
if you want to sell calendars,

115
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,309
I'm going
to need to see

116
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,364
more "Babe" and less
"Didrikson Zaharias."

117
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,229
Fine, I'll take
off one glove.

118
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,857
Mm-hmm.

119
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,033
Hmm, you know
what would look super good?

120
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,202
If you held
this glass of red wine.

121
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,117
Mmm, I love this wine.

122
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,463
Yeah, it's Andalusian.

123
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,038
Well, it seems real to me.

124
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,003
(laughs)

125
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,922
Okay, more wine
for you.

126
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,461
(raucous laughter)

127
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,303
(humming)

128
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,762
Ooh, that's <i>caliente, </i>baby.

129
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,262
Ooh, ooh,

130
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,184
pop goes the Chupacabra.

131
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,972
(Marge humming,

132
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,137
-Whoop!
-Okay.

133
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,234
Mmm, oh, meow.

134
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,600
Meow, meow, meow.

135
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,146
(humming)

136
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:57,981
Whoops!

137
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,316
(giggling)

138
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,610
(Homer laughs)

139
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,657
Hey, Carl,

140
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,780
look how I messed
with the names

141
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,576
on the softball
sign-up sheet.

142
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,869
(giggling)

143
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:10,952
It's delicious.

144
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,747
You know how Smitty's name
is Smitty?

145
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,790
(laughs)

146
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,963
Well, not anymore.

147
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,881
I changed the "M" to a...

148
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,959
That'll do, Homer.

149
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,094
...to a "P"--

150
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,630
Spitty, 'cause he
spits when he talks.

151
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,673
He had to have part
of his tongue removed.

152
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,717
That's real funny.

153
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,010
Oh, well, I
didn't know that.

154
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,143
Well, now you know.

155
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,470
Oh, quit dragging me.

156
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,215
When I grow up,
I'm gonna drag you around

157
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,677
and buy you clothes.

158
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,847
Oh, that's wonderful.

159
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:35,976
(groans)

160
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,812
What's all the hubbub-aloo?

161
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,687
(moans)

162
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,574
(screams)

163
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,531
I've been pin-upped.

164
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,031
(groaning)

165
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,874
And every month is me.

166
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,199
(gasps)

167
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,953
I don't remember
doing this.

168
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,245
(gasps)

169
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:56,168
I certainly don't remember
doing August.

170
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,629
Hey, calendar lady, you
gonna take your clothes off?

171
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,750
No.

172
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,007
Well, I got the
next best thing.

173
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,589
(chuckling)

174
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,715
Whoo-hoo.

175
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,681
(chuckling)

176
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,268
Great safety report,
Homer.

177
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,021
No meltdowns all week.

178
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,903
I'm making you
my new executive assistant.

179
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,821
Why can't I keep the job
I have now, whatever it is?

180
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,190
Not an option,
big fella.

181
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,987
Either you're my assistant
or you find a job elsewhere,

182
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,991
and in this economy,
elsewhere ain't hiring.

183
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:32,374
Oh, fine, I guess
I'm at your beck.

184
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,292
And call.

185
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,579
No...!

186
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,002
Yeah.

187
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,132
Oh, no,

188
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,089
it's a big turnout
at church today,

189
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,260
and the whole congregation has
seen my Scandinavian regions.

190
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,215
(crowd murmuring)

191
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,853
Here comes the woman
who made February

192
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,809
the hottest month of the year.

193
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,430
Her shapely gams
have finally persuaded me

194
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,437
to switch from the Julian
calendar to the Gregorian.

195
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,560
Marge, girl,

196
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,016
I just heard
your pants ain't hiring

197
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,397
because your butt won't quit.

198
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,025
(sighing)

199
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,316
(groans)

200
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,197
Homie, everyone
loved my calendar,

201
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,865
but only you get
to flip the pages.

202
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,254
Calendar?

203
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,831
Oh, my God, I forgot to move
Carl's 12:30 to 2:30.

204
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,418
Oh, his astrologist will show up

205
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,713
at the same time
as his astronomer.

206
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,916
This is not good,
this is not good.

207
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,047
(moans)

208
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,803
How about a little
Marge madness?

209
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,097
(horn blowing)

210
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:43,017
(motor stalling)

211
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:46,065
Oh, who am I kidding?

212
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,988
Marge, would you mind
if we just cuddle?

213
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,784
Cuddling's for after.

214
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,867
(Marge moaning)

215
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,003
(both moaning)

216
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,080
(Homer snoring, Marge gasping)

217
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,049
(mumbling)

218
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,050
(sighs)

219
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,261
Tomorrow, my love.

220
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,053
(groans)

221
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,255
Stupid Carl.

222
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,965
"Update the phone list,
Homer.

223
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,005
"You put my
contact lenses in

224
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:17,968
backwards, Homer."

225
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,017
(sighs)

226
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,310
I'm sorry, honey.

227
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,813
Maybe this will take
your mind off work.

228
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,015
Wash my car.

229
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,356
Re-foam my latte.

230
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,360
Book me a massage.

231
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,361
Shiatsu or better.

232
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,822
(screams)
Leave me alone, you two!

233
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,452
(sobbing)

234
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,742
(sighs)

235
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,244
<i>MRS. KRABAPPEL:</i>
<i>Class,</i>

236
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,445
today we're going to talk

237
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,945
about Washington crossing
the Delaware.

238
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:42,076
I'd like to watch Bart's mom
washing her underwear.

239
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,044
The British were led
by General Howe.

240
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,245
I'd give Bart's mom
a general wow.

241
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,415
Knock it off.

242
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,263
That's my mom you're
talking about.

243
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,168
Keep-away
with Bart's mom.

244
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:56,348
Mrs. S.,
you can tuck me in anytime.

245
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,929
Okay, buddy,
lower the eyebrows,

246
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,175
nice and easy.

247
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,773
Ow!
It's stuck!

248
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:09,355
I'll have a quizzical expression
for the rest of my life.

249
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,652
I'd like to get quizzical
with Bart's mom.

250
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,986
Shut up!

251
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,160
(both grunt)

252
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,158
Standing up for yourself
to an older boy?

253
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,830
We're going to
have to set up

254
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,118
an appointment
with your parents.

255
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,791
Let me, uh,
check my calendar.

256
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,211
(chuckles slyly)

257
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:27,169
I'm suddenly feeling, uh,
un-administrative feelings.

258
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,341
(both laughing lasciviously)

259
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,339
Yes.

260
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,130
(groans)

261
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:33,763
(floorboards creaking)

262
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,131
Homie?

263
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,257
Honey, I know it's been
a rough couple of weeks,

264
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,555
but I booked us a night
this Saturday

265
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,019
at a very
romantic hotel.

266
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,309
Garden view?

267
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,272
Ocean view,
obstructed.

268
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,944
(swoons)

269
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,738
All right, I put in
a hundred-hour work week,

270
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,910
but I took a power nap
while I was driving us here

271
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,449
and now I'm rarin' to go.

272
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:02,752
Well, I brought a few items to
make our night extra special--

273
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:06,748
massage oil, some lingerie
from The Horny Hubby,

274
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,792
and snuggle dice.

275
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:12,166
This one has an action
and this one has a body part.

276
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,634
See?

277
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,304
"Nuzzle... neck."

278
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,513
With pleasure!

279
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,473
Let me try.

280
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,013
"Lick... eyes."

281
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,597
Uh, I'll try again.

282
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,309
"Spank... hair"?

283
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,643
What the...?

284
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,847
(die rattling)

285
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,857
"Whisper into ass"?

286
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,019
Oh, this game sucks!

287
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,438
Why don't you just roll me?

288
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,358
We're gonna be...

289
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,906
(yawns) snore in the morning.

290
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,700
Damn it, why won't
you touch me?

291
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,115
Mm... ooh.

292
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,961
Okay.

293
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,419
Kiss me, baby!

294
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,709
Kiss me like a frog
in a fairy tale!

295
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,463
(moaning and squealing)

296
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,466

Last night <i>was </i>the
making it up to me!

The most intimate moment

311
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,213
we shared this week was
my ironing your shirts!

312
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,843
Actually, those
were Carl's shirts.

313
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,299
Oh!

314
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,009

320
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,516
Diddily...

321

(gasps)

322
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,239
Okay, Fission Week
kicks off on Monday

323
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,374
with a reception by the
International Proton Council.

324
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,582
Word is, protons
are the new electrons.

325
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,633
You know, Homer,
when I was your age,

326
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,748
it was the future,
'cause I'm younger than you.

327
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,165
Just something
to think about.

328
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,593
I will.
Edamame?

329
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,921
I don't have time for peeling.

330
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:19,966
Squirt them in.

331
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,969
Well, boys, Daddy's
back on the beam,

332
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,675
thanks to Christian prayer
and Doctor Sheldon Lowenstein.

333
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,516
We thought you
were gonna die.

334
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,771
And then Uncle Kevin
would have to raise us.

335
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,653
With his funny friend, David.

336
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,610
Oh, I'd put rocks
into your pockets

337
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,320
and walk you out to sea
before that happened.

338
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,280
-Yay!
-Yay!
-(doorbell ringing)

340
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,735
I want to invite
you and the boys

341
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,414
over to dinner
tomorrow night.

342
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,162
Okily-dokily,
but I'm warning you,

343
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,584
you're gonna see America's
number one dishwashing crew!

344
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,873
-I wash!
-And I dry!

345
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,087
Then I give 'em the squeak test
and into the dishwasher they go.

346
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,128
Oh!
