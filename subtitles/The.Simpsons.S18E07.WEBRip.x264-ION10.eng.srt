00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,440
(with lisp)
Ooh, thomeone
wearth a brathelet.

179
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,899
Who’th your boyfriend?

180
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,979
Uh... Dr. Osterberg?

181
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,113
Whoa, Marge,
for the first time in my life,

182
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,237
I’m excited
about going to work.

183
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,544
I’m glad someone in this house
feels their life has meaning.

184
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,909
You’re glad?

185
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,205
You don’t look glad.

186
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,918
Are you sure you know
what "glad" means?

187
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,839
I just wish I could do something
to be remembered by,

188
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,380
something that says
"Marge was here"

189
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,094
after I’m gone.

190
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,094
(muffled): Oh, honey,
what about the time...

191
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,006
(muffled gibberish)
Everybody loved that.

192
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,885
Love you.

193
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,894
(sighs heavily)

194
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,266
Ah, the story of my life.

195
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,693
They get the Popsicles,
I get the sticks.

196
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,622
Look, Maggie,
I made another you.

197
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,001
Out of sticky orange wood.

198
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,409
(squealing and laughing)

199
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,418
Marge, I was...

200
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,169
Folk art!

201
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,801
That’s my favorite
kind of folk medium.

202
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,378
I made it myself.

203
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,053
Marge, you’re a genius.

204
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,512
You should make sculptures
of other people.

205
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,012
Like Lenny, or Carl

206
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,394
or the new James Bond.

207
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,760
Will America accept
a British James Bond?

208
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,677
I can’t wait to find out.

209
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,436
("Feels So Good"
by Chuck Mangione playing)

210
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,460
(helicopter flying overhead)

211
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,375
This is Kent Brockman.

212
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,136
A high-speed pursuit
is taking place

213
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,178
on the streets of Springfield.

214
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,892
We responded immediately
after seeing it on Channels two,

215
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,683
four, five, seven and 63.

216
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,846
The driver is getting
out of his car...

217
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,395
he’s running to a helipad,

218
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,808
he’s taking off in a copter.

219
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,396
Why, here he is
next to us.

220
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:10,031
Kent, there seems to be
a traffic tie-up

221
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,449
at the 101-405 interchange.

222
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,409
I recommend taking
surface streets.

223
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,160
Jailbird away.

224
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,542
Well, there you have it,
people...

225
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,499
Sweet Morley Safer!

226
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,209
Do I see a telegenic housewife

227
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,879
making art
out of popsicle sticks?

228
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,748
Set this baby down--
I smell soft news.

229
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,257
Ma’am, I’d like to feature you
on my award-submitted segment,

230
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,683
Kent Brockman’s
"Kent-resting People".

231
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,852
Really? You think people would
be Kent-rested in me?

232
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,561
-I do.
-Hm!

233
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,015
I’m here with local sculptress
Marge Simpson who works in,

234
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,026
of all media,
Popsicle stick.

235
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:55,568
Our viewers want to know two
things: why and how come.

236
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,195
Why did cavemen
paint on walls?

237
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,282
Why do you scratch
your name on Tupperware?

238
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,658
So when you die,
something’s left behind

239
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:06,415
that says, "I was here,
I mattered.

240
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,419
That’s my Tupperware."

241
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,421
Human feelings,
expressed by a human.

242
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,844
And here’s a local nobody
enjoying his likeness.

243
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,974
Let’s take a sneaky-peeky.

244
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,051
My God, it’s beauty-ful.

245
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,636
I finally see the goodness
in myself.

246
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,772
Come here, you.

247
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,848
Oh, I’m so glad
you like it, Moe.

248
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,145
That’s right, tell me all
your little wooden dreams.

249
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,480
You’re not alone anymore.
No you ain’t.

250
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,026
Aw, you’re shivering,
are you cold?

251
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:35,951
Where you goin’, Marge?

252
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,911
Honey,
I brought you more sticks.

253
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,834
This is the most fun I’ve
ever had giving you wood.

254
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,501
Homie, this sculpting has
made me feel so fulfilled.

255
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,330
I’m as hopeful
and full of life

256
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,126
as I was in the years
before I met you.

257
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,250
It’s good to see
you smile again.

258
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,087
I was lonely being
happy all by myself.

259
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,893
Well, no one’s gonna be
lonely tonight.

260
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,509
(moaning)

261
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,846
(laughs)
Let me just put on
some romantic music.

262
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,364
("Pop Goes the Weasel"
playing)

263
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,649
Hey, we got
the whole night, baby,

264
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,153
let’s slow things down.

265
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,741
-(song plays at slow speed)
-(Marge gasps) Ooh...

266
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,072
(moaning)

267
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,456
Marge, you are one
fantastic artist,

268
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:36,093
and no one knows art like a
Texan with too much money.

269
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,012
You’re from Texas?

270
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,589
That’s right.

271
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,514
And I want to finance
a fancy-shmancy art show,

272
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,144
starring your wooden wonders.

273
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,351
Yee-hah. (laughing)

274
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,312
(gasps)
My own art show?

275
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,642
I’m so happy.

276
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,727
Do you mind?

277
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,943
Yee-hah!

278
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,733
I’m excited you’re excited.

279
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,606
Yee-hah! Yee-hah!
Yee-hah! Yee-hah!

280
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:02,284
Shoot on the "yee,"
not the "hah."

281
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,124
Hey lady,

282
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,199
{\an8}you gotta pay
to use my likeness.

283
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,334
It’s a registered trademark.

284
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,501
(groans)

285
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,709
(grunts)

286
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,830
Hey, I do more than TV.

287
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,457
I had a one-man show
on Broadway.

288
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,344
That’s who showed up--
one man.

289
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,421
(laughing)

290
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,837
Long story short,
I won a Drama Desk Award.

291
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,177
Marge, everything
looks wonderful.

292
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,772
Well, I’m off to pedal
my frosty wares.

293
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,178
You can’t go to work.

294
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,306
I need you here
for emotional support.

295
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,943
Plus you make
a small crowd look huge.

296
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:37,071
Sweetie, I can’t abandon
my route even for one day.

297
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,489
If those kids discover the
link between eating right

298
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,898
and feeling good,
I am screwed.

299
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,067
But I’ll be back in time
for your show.

300
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,236
The show starts at 3:00.

301
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,664
You promise
you’ll be here?

302
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,832
I would never
let you down.

303
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,621
Our marriage is like
soft-serve ice cream.

304
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,495
And trust is
the hard chocolate shell

305
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,252
that keeps it from
melting onto our carpet.

306
00:13:56,335 --> 00:14:01,545
In "cone-clusion,"
here’s the scoop: I love you.

307
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,012
(sighs)

308
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,263
(playing "Pop Goes the Weasel"
over speaker)

309
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,215
(clamoring)

310
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,306
(tires screeching)

311
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,807
What the hell do you kids want?!

312
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:14,694
Oh, right, ice cream.

313
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,730
(children cheering)

314
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,114
(song continues)

315
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,574
Oh, my God.

316
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,323
It’s the opportunity
of a lifetime.

317
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,315
(over truck PA)
Attention, losers:

318
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,487
this is your chance to buy
your kids some frozen love.

319
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,997
I’m not going to fall
for such a cheap stunt.

320
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,289
Mom would.

321
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,462
Hey, give me
one of everything!

322
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,790
Hey!

323
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,375
(group shouting)

324
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,877
(chorus of "Mmm")

325
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,890
Sorry, I’m all
out of ice cream.

326
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,178
Already? It’s only 38 seconds
to 3:00.

327
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,763
(gasps)
Marge’s show!

328
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,154
Must jettison excess weight.

329
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,991
(Homer yelling)

330
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,029
D’oh!

331
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,033
(panting)

332
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,449
Oh, my God.
I only got nine seconds
till Marge’s show.

333
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,657
Eight... seven...

334
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,918
(groans)
Homer, where are you?

335
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,461
(horns honking)

336
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:24,085
Oh, I’ll never make it.

337
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,263
Unless...

338
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,889
Whoo-hoo! I’m going
to be on time.

339
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:33,973
(owl hooting)

340
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,678
(Homer, scout shrieking)

341
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,478
-(roaring)
-(shrieks)

342
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,401
(grunts)

343
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,069
(shouts)

344
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,649
(screaming)

345
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,196
(tires screeching)

346
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,449
(all screaming)

347
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,695
(roaring softly)

348
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,247
(groans)

349
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,325
No, no, no, save your energy.

350
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,536
Don’t try to talk.

351
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,626
I don’t know where
Carl ends and I begin.

352
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,172
See, statements like that are
why people think we’re gay.

353
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,430
I made it back for your show,
honey...

354
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:17,354
Well, Homer, you destroyed
my artwork and my dreams.

355
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,814
Good job, very thorough.

356
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,266
Marge, let me explain.

357
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,397
I had a chance to make
a little more money by
exploiting broken families...

358
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,145
Oh, stop, just stop.

359
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,987
You don’t care about anyone
else’s happiness but your own.

360
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,791
Well, excuse me

361
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:38,408
for having enormous flaws
that I don’t work on!

362
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,550
♪♪

363
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,748
(knocking on door)

364
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,378
HOMER: Marge?

365
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,514
Marge?

366
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,180
Honey, you’ve been
in there all day.

367
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,050
You got to eat something.

368
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,887
Why don’t you come
downstairs and cook dinner?

369
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,393
Lasagna would be awesome.

370
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,725
Marge?

371
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,357
Marge?
I wrote you a check for $300

372
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,775
to pay for all
the sculptures I broke.

373
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:12,954
Okay?

374
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,578
Oh, I see.

375
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,289
You’d prefer a wire transfer.

376
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,170
Well, what’s
your routing number?

377
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,208
That’s okay, I can get it
from the bank, honey.

378
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,962
I just need
to know your birthday.

379
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,841
Marge? I have an apology
that I hope is better

380
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:37,007
than all the other ones,
so please listen carefully.

381
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,267
The thing I liked best about
being an ice cream man

382
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,730
wasn’t the free ice cream
or the colorful toppings,

383
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,772
or the love I received
from obese children.

384
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,777
It was giving you those sticks,
and watching you smile

385
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,530
as you turned them into art.

386
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,033
If it would win you back,
I would gradually eat

387
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,155
all the parts of a motorcycle.

388
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,332
I hope it doesn’t come to that.

389
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:05,171
Could you please
just give me a sign that
you still love me a little?

390
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,210
If you won’t talk to me,
I’ll send in Polaroids

391
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,585
to show you how sad I am
that I let you down.

392
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,476
I’m laughing in the last one,

393
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,935
but it’s only ’cause the cat
fell down the stairs.

394
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,327
(snoring and mumbling)

395
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,712
Marge? Marge?!

396
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,039
She’s been gone for a while.

397
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,044
Grampa’s been watching us.

398
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,206
You kids have been
real good tonight.

399
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,513
-Mom!
-Mom!

400
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,220
Marge, where are you?!

401
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,300
Did you change your name?

402
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,756
Is it Kelly?

403
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,006
Kelly!

404
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:03,017
Comic Book Guy,
have you seen our mom?

405
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,020
A complete list of things
I have seen

406
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,152
or not seen is available
on my blog.

407
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,939
Your mother
is on the "not seen" list,

408
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,402
along with "a Star Wars film

409
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,282
that was any good
since the first one."

410
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,069
And even that has been
ruined by CGI additions.

411
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,244
Bravo, George.

412
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,322
There’s Mom!

413
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,697
Oh, my God--
she’s going to jump.

414
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:24,414
Marge, don’t do it!
Give divorce a chance!

415
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:28,126
Homer, I want to show the world
how I feel about you.

416
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,668
The world’s
not that interested.

417
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,921
They will be.

418
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,554
Ready, bullies?

419
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,880
ALL: Ready.

420
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:47,482
Homer, you wanted a sign
that I still love you,
so here it is.

421
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,101
Wow!

422
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,318
You made me a sculpture
of Magilla Gorilla.

423
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,398
No, Homer.

424
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:58,663
It’s you--my sweet,
perfectly imperfect you.

425
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:02,199
Okay, boys,
on my command, fire.

426
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,044
But nobody’s done
anything wrong.

427
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,909
Geez, if everyone was like you,
our morgues would be empty.

428
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,957
Homie, I realized
that my most enduring creation

429
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,753
is the life
I’ve sculpted with you.

430
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,127
ALL: Aah!

431
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:19,304
Now I know that my lega-she
is really a lega-we.

432
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,345
I just have one question,
my darling:

433
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,640
What did you do
with the ice cream
that was on all those sticks?

434
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,104
It’s in that Dumpster.

435
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,280
Not that one!

436
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,790
{\an8}This statue,
subject unknown,

437
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,158
is the last remaining
example of art

438
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,326
before the collapse
of the western world.

439
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,714
If only we’d known
that iPods would unite

440
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,502
and overthrow the very humans
they entertained.

441
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,956
(groaning)

442
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,966
What do you want from us?!

443
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,128
Nothing.

444
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,386
We just like whipping.

445
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:05,638
(groaning)

446
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,142
