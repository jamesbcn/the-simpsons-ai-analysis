00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,093
CROWD:
Ah!

180
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,589
A green spinner
to build suspense

181
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,342
and then the big finale.

182
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,473
The ka-pow boom!

183
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,510
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

184
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,263
pow, pow, pow, pow, pow,
ba-boom!

185
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,595
Ka-powi.

186
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,938
(sizzling)

187
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,940
(shrieks)

188
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,399
(screaming)

189
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,692
(fireworks whistle)

190
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,145
(screaming)

191
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,039
Oh, so, forming
an angry mob, eh?

192
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,371
Who we going after?

193
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,285
Oh, hey!

194
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,035
Well, at least
they left your underwear on.

195
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,668
That was nice of them.

196
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,094
I think the hook
is touching my brain.

197
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,804
(speaking gibberish)

198
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,305
...package, board baby,

199
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,888
bortal, bortal, bortal.

200
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,015
My husband meant no harm.

201
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,312
There must be some way
he can pay for what he did.

202
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,147
He’s good
at opening jars.

203
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,532
I say let him fish it off.

204
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,610
These waters are so barren,

205
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,534
by the time he pays the debt,

206
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,953
he’ll be as old
and as queer as I am.

207
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,703
Queer strange,
or queer gay?

208
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,454
Oh, a touch of both.

209
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,866
(maniacal cackling)

210
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,294
Ooh... (kissing sounds)

211
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,542
(maniacal cackling)

212
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,084
Ooh... (kissing sounds)

213
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,348
Homer, I want you
to meet my crew.

214
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,510
This is
my first mate, Billy.

215
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,928
And this is Fausto.

216
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,477
Yeah, he just plays
with that knife

217
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,690
all day and night.

218
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,190
It’s my thing.

219
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,772
Great, now I need a new thing.

220
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,078
How many yum-yum fish
did we get?

221
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,830
(sighing):
None.

222
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,622
Just a few slarg fish.

223
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,075
Ew, it tastes terrible.

224
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,666
You don’t eat it.
Its oil is used

225
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,631
to polish
stripper poles.

226
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:14,511
Ugh, finally, something
even <i>I </i>wouldn’t eat.

227
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,880
Well, maybe a little more.

228
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,093
Terrible.

229
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,891
(thunder crashing)

230
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,602
Here you go.

231
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,483
Beer battered shrimp.

232
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,851
Wait, this is bait.

233
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,818
Homer, I told you to
beer batter the shrimp

234
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,018
and bait the hooks.

235
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,648
Did you do
the opposite?

236
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,154
Uh, I thought today
was Opposite Day.

237
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,987
By the way,
you’re very ugly.

238
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,622
(loud whisper):
It’s Opposite Day.

239
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,369
Hey, Captain, we should not
go out and check the hooks.

240
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:47,002
It’s not Opposite Day.

241
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:51,171
So that means...
it <i>is </i>Opposite Day.

242
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,922
CAPTAIN:
It’s not Opposite Day!

243
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,850
(boat creaking)

244
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,100
The yum-yum fish--
they’re back.

245
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,805
We’re going to be rich.

246
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,055
And it’s all thanks
to you, Homer.

247
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,358
Or should I say...
Chief Fish Clubber Homer.

248
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,150
I don’t know what to say.

249
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,737
Let your club
do the talking.

250
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,040
(Etta James singing):
<i>♪ At last ♪</i>

251
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:34,712

252

<i>♪ My lonely days are over... ♪</i>

253
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,515
Ooh, an institute.

<i>DIORAMA VOICE:</i>
<i>Press button to see what</i>
<i>global warming will do</i>

255
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,994
<i>in the next three years.</i>

256
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,285
Three years
is a long ways away.

257
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,661
MAN:
Oh, my God--

258
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,878
a perfect storm.

259
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,748
My husband is out there.

260
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,125
I won’t lie to you.

261
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,132
It’s the most powerful storm
I’ve ever seen,

262
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,085
and I’ve seen <i>three </i>storms.

263
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,385
(gasping)

264
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,898
Captain, I don’t like
the look of the western sky.

265
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,150
Let us head back.

266
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,152
I’m sure our TiVo’s are
groaning with great shows.

267
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,735
We’re not leaving while
there’s still fish
to be air-drowned.

268
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,111
Are you sure,
Captain?

269
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,778
The barometer don’t lie.

270
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,737
All right, now listen,
if a storm were coming,

271
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,158
my trick knee would
be acting up.

272
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,667
Hey... hey... hey... hey.

273
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,094
Dear God.

274
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,153
Oh, Homie, I’m so worried.

275
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,109
But if I concentrate,
our love is so strong,

276
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,650
I know I can hear your thoughts.

277
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,614
<i>HOMER:</i>
<i>Dear Marge, how are you?</i>

278
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,406
<i>I am fine.</i>

00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,029
<i>The waves here are way bigger</i>

284
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,225
This old barge
can’t take much more!

285
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,269
Take out the life raft!

286
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,193
Bart, what the hell
are you doing in there?

287
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,105
Dad, I couldn’t stay
with Mom and Lisa

288
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,573
while you were
out here.

289
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,203
Aw, son.

290
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
There were going to go
to the folk art museum,

291
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,945
then they were going
to paint crab shells.

292
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,124
Not crush them, paint them!

293
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,702
You did the right
thing, boy.

294
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,917
(all agree)

295
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:18,962
Ugh!

296
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,003
What is it, Moe?

297
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,415
I just had this
awful feeling

298
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,133
that, uh, Homer’s
in terrible trouble.

299
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,673
Ooh, that’s funny.

300
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,047
I just had a feeling
that some guy I don’t know

301
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,394
named Fausto
is in trouble.

302
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,679
Come on.
We got to go
help Homer.

303
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,682
And Fausto!

304
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,473
(thunder crashing)

305
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,766
Whoa, whoa, it’s really
coming down out there.

306
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,271
We could run
to the car.

307
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,193
Yeah, but then we’d have
to stand there

308
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,521
while we get
the doors unlocked.

309
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,856
Don’t you have
one of them keys

310
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,071
that beeps
the doors open?

311
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,150
Yeah, but still.

312
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,997
(all screaming)

313
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,094
Watch me drive
a golf ball off the bow.

314
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,799
(grunts)

315
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,428
Yeah!

316
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,607
Shi...

317
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,157
...pwreck!

318
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,539
(yelling)

319
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,214
We’re still gonna make it,
aren’t we, Dad?

320
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,092
Uh, sure we will, son.

321
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,129
Right, Captain?

322
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,802
Absolutely, Bart.

323
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,760
The sea wouldn’t dare
take the life

324
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,931
of an apple-cheeked young lad
like yourself.

325
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,600
(loud whisper):
Should I hit him
with a shovel

326
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,889
to spare him the pain
of drowning?

327
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,353
(loud whisper):
Not yet.

328
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,023
What’s the code word?

329
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:04,515
(both gasp)

330
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,436
Oh, Mother Sea,
giver of fish,

331
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,026
taker of boats,
toilet to the world,

332
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:15,453
the Greeks call you "Poseidon,"
the Romans... "Aquaman."

333
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:19,204
Look into thy starfish heart
and protect our souls

334
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:24,418
so we might live
to go tubing on thee again.

335
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,921
Do you think your mother
will every remarry?

336
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,174
BART:
In about two seconds.

337
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,915
Why, you little...!

338
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,177
(gasping, grunting sounds)

339
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,678
Just see if I die!

340
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,096
(belling tolling)

341
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,112
Bart was on the boat?

342
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,905
(sobbing)

343
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:58,619
We’ll never know how that brave
crew spent their final moments.

344
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:03,122
Maybe a boiler blew up,
sheared their faces clean off.

345
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,287
All we do know is they’re
in heaven now,

346
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:10,506
hanging their lines off a cloud
and fishing for airplanes.

347
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,089
HOMER:
The hell we are!

348
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,931
Homer!

349
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,010

{\an8}Yi-yo-yu!

352
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,015
How did you make it?

353
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,693
Well, handsome here
was in big trouble...

354
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,151
<i>...when suddenly...</i>

355
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,414
(gasps)

356
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,490
Oh, my God, it’s beautiful!

357
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:56,969
Welcome, Homer
to our watery realm.

358
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:57,972
Wait a minute.

359
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,013
How am I breathing?

360
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,846
You’re not.

361
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,141
<i>Then when all seemed lost...</i>

362
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,105
(coughing)

363
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:17,572
Aw! Lot of garbage
fish today.

364
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,276
I can’t go back
to living on the
surface world!

365
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,446
I can’t!

366
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,213
<i>Then they brought us home.</i>

367
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,709
So that’s our story.

368
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,381
Oh, wait. We were attacked
by a giant whale.

369
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,589
He turned out
to be pretty cool.

370
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,089
Come on, boys.

371
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,961
Let’s grab our nets
and go fish us some yum-yums.

372
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:34,967
(all cheer)

373
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,588
Wait!

374
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,715
Haven’t you learned
a lesson here?

375
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,602
Overfishing and greed
have brought this town

376
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,809
nothing but wrack and ruin.

377
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,849
(murmuring)

378
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:47,692
Repent! Repent,
before it’s too late!

379
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:52,439
I always wanted to do that
in a New England church.

380
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,944
Little she-nag
has a point.

381
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,356
Got to be some way
we can make money

382
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,454
without depleting
our precious oceans.

383
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,275
(saws buzzing loudly)

384
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,923
Nicely done, Lis.

385
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,079
Instead of killing
living things,

386
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,337
they’re just
killing trees.

387
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,788
MAN:
Step aside, please.

388
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,588
These logs have to go
to Larry Flynt’s paper mill,

389
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:19,432
where they’ll be made
into <i>Hustler </i>and Barely Legal
magazines.

390
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,176
This is not what
I wanted at all.

391
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,265
(chainsaws buzzing)

392
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,941
(gasping)

393
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,019

by Camille Saint-Saens plays)
