(clearing throat)
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,587
Before last year's
Halloween show

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,255
I warned you not to let
your children watch,

4
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:12,764
but you did anyway.

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,556
Well, this year's episode
is even worse.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,310
It's scarier, more violent,

7
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:20,732
and I think they snuck in
some bad language too.

8
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:24,322
So please, tuck in
your children and--

9
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,859
(groans)

10
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,992
Well, if you didn't
listen to me last time

11
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,239
you're not going to now.

12
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,071
Enjoy the show.

13
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,451

{\an8}Hey, if you don't like it,

{\an8}Hey, aren't you
a little old for this?

26
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,618
{\an8}You're not even
wearing costumes.

27
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,618
{\an8}Hand over the candy,

{\an8}Here you go, kids.

00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,747
{\an8}Heh-heh, heh.

31
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,040

35
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,589
{\an8}We're home.

36
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,764
Aah... whoo!

37
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,472
Get a good haul
this year?

38
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:35,802
Jackpot!

39
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,467
I'm very, very proud
of you kids.

40
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:41,846
We would have gotten more
if Lisa could walk faster.

41
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,725
I didn't select this
costume for mobility.

42
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,442
I wore it to salute

43
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,112
the noble native Americans
of the Pacific Northwest.

44
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,150
Yaahh!

45
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,903
(laughing)

46
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,824
Now, children, you can have
one piece of candy tonight,

47
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,414
and save the rest for--
(groans)

48
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,616
If you eat too much,
you'll have nightmares.

49
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,622
Oh, yeah,
everybody in this family

50
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,754
is gonna have
a bad nightmare tonight.

51
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,882
Oh, yeah,
three bad nightmares.

52
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,589
I'd like to see that.
Heh-heh-heh.

53
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,420
(thunderclap)

54
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,965
Ooh.

55
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,061
{\an8}(speaking Arabic)

56
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,685
What a dump!

57
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,021
Why would Princess Grace
live in a place like this?

58
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,897
-Dad, that's Monaco.
-D'oh!

59
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,737
I can do that,
but I don't want to.

60
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,829
Ugh! What is this thing?

61
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:44,119
It is a monkey's paw, dating
back to Al-al Ben Abdallah.

62
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,705
It has the power to
grant wishes to its owner.

63
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,331
Oh, yeah? How much?

64
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,958
Sir, I must strongly advise you,
do not purchase this.

65
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,545
Behind every wish
lurks grave misfortune.

66
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,721
I myself was once
president of Algeria.

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,340
Come on, pal,
I don't want to hear
your life story. Paw me.

68
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:04,175
Eww, Homer. Where did you get
that ugly thing?

69
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,187
Why, at that little shop
right over... there.

70
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,440
(gasps)

71
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,861
Oh, no, wait,
it was over there.

72
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,359
You'll be sorry.

73
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,652
MAN (on PA): <i>Flight #7,</i>
<i>Marrakech to Springfield,</i>

74
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,696
<i>now boarding.</i>

75
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,608
Just a moment.

76
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,620
(yelling in Arabic)

77
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,042
{\an8}Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

78
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,370
They're souvenirs.

79
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,615
You must pay a fine
of two American dollars.

80
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,037
Okay.

81
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,955
Let's wish for x-ray specs
that really work.

82
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:32,995
No, Bart-- peace on earth.

83
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,047
-X-ray specs.
-Peace on earth.

84
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,090
-X-ray specs.
-Peace on earth.

85
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,973
-X-ray specs.
-Peace on earth.

86
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,010
Forget it, you two.
As the pants-wearer
of this house,

87
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,393
I get the first wish.

88
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,260
Homer, there's something
I don't like

89
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,968
about that severed hand.

90
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,228
Marge, don't flake out
on me.

91
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,810
That monkey's paw is gonna
make our dreams come true.

92
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,437
Oh, no!
Maggie made a wish.

93
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,235
(horn honks)

94
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,569
Oh, my land!

95
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,195
Ooh! A luxury car.

96
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,321
Good baby.

97
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,907
Good Maggie.

98
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,541
MARGE: Ohh, a new pacifier.

99
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,212
D'oh!

100
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,090
Okay, no more foolin' around.
Paw, this is Bart.

101
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,458
I wish for the Simpsons
to be rich and famous.

102
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,705
Now you're talking.

103
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,676
BOTH: Yay!

104
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,509
Woohoo!

105
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,354
Look, everybody.
My purse exploded!

106
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,020
Come on, everybody.

107
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,939
We're going to the fanciest
restaurant in town.

108
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,598
MAITRE 'D:
I'm terribly sorry.

109
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,057
I have absolutely nothing
until June.

110
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,607
Ah, the Simpsons!

111
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,111
Right this way,
please.

112
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,913
Homer, maybe fame and fortune
aren't as bad as they say.

113
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,369
If I hear one more thing
about the Simpsons,

114
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,989
I swear
I'm going to scream.

115
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,036
At first they were
cute and funny,

116
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,160
but now
they're just annoying.

117
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,036
18 bucks for this?
What a rip-off.

118
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,375
<i>♪ Man smart,</i>
<i>the woman is smarter ♪</i>

119
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,011

120
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,838
Man, this thing's
really getting out of hand.

121
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,929
Is there anything they won't do?

122
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,433
Oh, Homer,
this is awful.

123
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,975
Come to think of it,
the guy that sold me this thing

124
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,269
did say the wishes
would bring grave misfortune.

125
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,313
I thought he was
just being colorful.

126
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,437
I wish for world peace.

127
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,192
Lisa, that was
very selfish of you!

128
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,239
{\an8}Sorry about the Falklands,
old boy.

129
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,326
{\an8}Oh, forget it.

130
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,080
{\an8}We kind of knew
they were yours.

131
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,170
Well, won't be needing
these anymore.

Oh, yes, Kodos.

137
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:08,413
Earth is now ripe
for the plucking.

138
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,003
(menacing laughter)

139
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,000
(menacing laughter continues)

140
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,585
People of Earth,

141
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:29,386
we come to you in the spirit
of hostility and menace.

142
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,102
Now, let's be reasonable.

143
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,682
We can resolve our
differences peacefully.

144
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:33,727
Uh... ow!

145
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,020
Your superior intellect

146
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,523
is no match
for our puny weapons.

147
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,855
Gordon, you've got
to do something.

148
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,400
What do you
want me to do?

149
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,613
I'm a baker now.

150
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,072
They conquered us
with a club.

151
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,612
Wish we'd saved an A-bomb
or two.

152
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,065
Move along humans.

153
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,275
(groaning)

154
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,275
This is all
the Simpsons' fault.

155
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,037
Before I was just
bored with their antics
and their merchandise.

156
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,289
Now I wish they were dead.

157
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,671
Geez, now we're slaves.
This paw sucks.

158
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,288
Okay, okay, I'll make
a wish that can't backfire.

159
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,286
I wish for a turkey sandwich

160
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,298
on rye bread

161
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,049
with lettuce and mustard

162
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,931
and-- and I don't want
any zombie turkeys.

163
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,388
I don't want to turn
into a turkey myself

164
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,719
and I don't want any other
weird surprises, you got it?

165
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,522
Hey!

166
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,061
Hmm... mmm!

167
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,476
Mmm... not bad.

168
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,484
Nice hot mustard...

169
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,605
good bread...

170
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,531
turkey's a little dry...

171
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,609
The turkey's a little dry?!

172
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,905
Oh, foul the cursed thing!

173
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,659
What demon
from the depths of hell

174
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,701
created thee?

175
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,738
Hey, fellow slave.

176
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,618
Is that one of
those monkey paw dealies

177
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,415
that lets you
wish for things?

178
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,208
Yeah, but I got
to warn you

179
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,332
that this thing is--

180
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,378
Yeah, that's what it is.

181
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,882
You want to try it?

182
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,053
Okely-dokely.

183
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,971
Ooh, would you
look at that.

184
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,430
Aahh!

185
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,220
Kneel before my slingshot,
puny earthling!

186
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,095
Well, I guess
my first wish

187
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,312
is to get rid
of those awful aliens.

188
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,982
Aahh! He's got a board
with a nail in it!

189
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,731
Enslave humanity, will ya?!

190
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,193
Run, Kodos!

191
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,862
Ha-ha-ha!

192
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,203
Well, Kang, it seems
the earthlings won.

193
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,870
Did they?

194
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,698
That board with the nail in it
may have defeated us,

195
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,334
but the humans won't stop there.

196
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,751
They'll make bigger boards
and bigger nails.

197
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,830
Soon they will make
a board with a nail so big

198
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,917
it will destroy them all!

199
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,882
(menacing laughter)

200
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,050
(cheering)

201
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,387
Hey, Homer,

202
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,352
this little thingumajig
really works great.

203
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,392
Now that I've saved the earth,

204
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,516
maybe I ought to spruce up
the old homestead.

205
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,436
I wish I had a monkey's paw.

206
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:48,948
LISA: Bart?

207
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,238
Bart?

208
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,111
Huh? What's the matter?

209
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,318
I had a bad dream.

210
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,777
Could I sleep in your bed?

211
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,327
No.

212
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,540
I'll give you a candy necklace.

213
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,828
Climb aboard.

214
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,416
Thanks, Bart.

215
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,134
Less talk, more sleep.

216
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:15,756
NARRATOR: <i>Presented for</i>
<i>your consideration:</i>

217
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,016
<i>Springfield--</i>
<i>an average little town</i>

218
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,179
<i>with a not-so-average</i>
<i>monster.</i>

219
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,598
VOICES: Happy thoughts.
Happy, happy, happy...

220
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,567
NARRATOR:
<i>The people of Springfield</i>
<i>have to make sure</i>

221
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,528
<i>they think happy thoughts</i>
<i>and say happy things</i>

222
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,439
<i>because</i>
<i>this particular monster</i>

223
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,488
<i>can read minds,</i>

224
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,201
<i>and if displeased</i>

225
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,661
<i>can turn people into</i>
<i>grotesque walking terrors.</i>

226
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,332
Happy thoughts.
Happy thoughts.

227
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,621
Boy, I'm getting
mighty sick of this.

228
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,035
Huh?

229
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,673
Ruff, ruff, ruff. Bow-wow.

230
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,382
NARRATOR:
<i>And did I mention</i>

231
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,840
<i>that the monster</i>
<i>is a ten-year-old boy?</i>

232
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,381
<i>Quite a twist, huh?</i>

233
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,634
<i>Betcha didn't see</i>
<i>that one coming.</i>

234
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,337
Good morning.

235
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,547
(spitting)

236
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,386
-Morning.
-Good morning, dear.

237
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,809
Hiya, Bart.
How's my boy?

238
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,351
(nervous laughing)

239
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,555
-(meowing, purring)
-Every day, same old cat.

240
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,355
I'll make him more interesting.

241
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:12,862
(screaming)

242
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,775
Ah, there. That's better.

243
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,124
Much better.

244
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,828
Oh, good,
the curtains are on fire.

245
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,909
It's good that you made
that awful thing, Bart.

246
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,406
It's real good.

247
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,077
Hadn't you better
get ready for school?

248
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,416
Okay.

249
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,421
He gets it from your side
of the family, you know.

250
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,174
No monsters on my side.

251
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,679
-Hi, guys.
-Aahh!

252
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,100
{\an8}Hi, Otto.
Move over, I'm driving.

253
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,599
No can do,
little buddy.

254
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,020
See, there's a rule--

255
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,098
Oh, wait.
You're the little dude

256
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,984
with all the gnarly powers.

257
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,561
(kids screaming)

258
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,108
Quit riding the brake, Otto.

259
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,651
Give it some gas, man.

260
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,944
Hey, this is fun, isn't it?

261
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,358
We're going to die, aren't we?

262
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,695
BOTH: Hiya, Bart!

263
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,753
TEACHER:
Well, class,

264
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,708
the history of our country
has been changed again

265
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,880
to correspond
with Bart's answers
on yesterday's test.

266
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,288
(all groaning)

267
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,457
America was now discovered
in 1942 by...

268
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,336
{\an8}"some guy"

269
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,223
and our country
isn't called America anymore.

270
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,721
It's Bonerland.

271
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,811
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

272
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,769
<i>This is Principal Skinner.</i>

273
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,769
<i>Bart, this one's for you.</i>

274
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,141

ALL (mumbling):
Happy thoughts,
happy thoughts...

281
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,412
Moe's Tavern.

282
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,241
Hold on. I'll check.

283
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,866
Uh, hey, everybody.

284
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,163
I'm a stupid moron

285
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,666
with an ugly face
and a big butt

286
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:51,538
and my butt smells and
I like to kiss my own butt.

287
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,837
(laughing)

288
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,301
BARNEY:
That's a new one!

289
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,171
Wait a minute.

290
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,968
(laughing)

291
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,601
(fake laughing)

292
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,849

00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,267
I love school.

298
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,189
(yelps)

299
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,815
Come on, come on.
Make it, make it, make it.

300
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,821
Please, please, please.

301
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,493
I want to watch Krusty.

302
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,532
Shut up, boy.

303
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,574
If they make
this field goal,

304
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,657
I win 50 bucks.

305
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:26,906

<i>The kick is up.</i>

00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,656

<i>Aahh!... oof!</i>

309
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,708
ANNOUNCER: <i>And it's no good,</i>

310
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,507
<i>every time</i>
<i>something strange happens--</i>

311
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,761
<i>it's good that</i>
<i>Bart did that.</i>

312
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,143
<i>It's very good.</i>

313
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,509

00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,767

<i>346 consecutive hours</i>

00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,776
<i>who won't let me stop!</i>

318
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:59,148
<i>Anyway, now let's go over</i>
<i>and see if Sideshow Mel</i>

319
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,156
<i>has any more of those legal</i>

320
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,948
<i>over-the-counter</i>

<i>(kids cheering)</i>

<i>Slowly, slowly.</i>

00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,827
<i>Don't make a sound.</i>
<i>Don't even think</i>

324
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,538
<i>because he can</i>
<i>hear your thoughts.</i>

325
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,668
<i>Then, when he's least</i>
<i>expecting it</i>

326
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,045
<i>bash his head in</i>
<i>with a chair.</i>

327
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,471
<i>End of monster.</i>
<i>(chuckles)</i>

328
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,046
(Homer shrieks)

329
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,466
(gasps)

330
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,644
Bart!

331
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,892
Lisa did it.

332
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,273
That's it, young man.

333
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,310
You're coming with me.

334
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,693
Please?

335
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,190
You like attention
don't you, Bart?

336
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,273
Do I ever.

337
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,858
Well, we all do.

338
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,153
The problem is that
you don't care

339
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,026
whether you get
good attention for, say,

340
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,532
getting high marks in school

341
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,204
or bad attention
for, say,

342
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,742
turning your father into
a Jack-in-the-box.

343
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,787
Homer, I see you agree
with my theory.

344
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,790
I'm not nodding.
It's the air conditioning.

345
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,502
Well, that's too bad because

346
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,792
the attention the boy craves
should be coming from you.

347
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,246
I want you to spend some
quality time with him.

348
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,797
Get to know him.

349
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,130
Maybe even love him.

350
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:04,929
(cheering)

351
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:05,930
D'oh!

352
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,601
Whoa-oh-oh.

353
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,902
(all screaming)

354
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,990
Eeyii!

355
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,910
(grunting)

356
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,791
(yawning)

357
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,789
Good night, son.

358
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,500
Good night, Dad.

359
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,000
You know, these last few days
have been really swell.

360
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,843
I wish there was something
I could do to repay you.

361
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,838
Well, if you wanted to,
you could give me my body back.

362
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:42,972
You got it.

363
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,795
Oh! Hey, hey.

364
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,967
Oh, oh...

365
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,184
Thanks, boy.

366
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,724
I love you, Dad.

367
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,767
I love you, son.

368
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:59,019
Aaaaaaaaahhh!

369
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,277
BOTH: Mom! Dad!

370
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,032
My goodness!
What's wrong?

371
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,454
We both had nightmares.

372
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,532
Can we sleep with you?

373
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,197
You both toilet trained?

374
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,825
-BOTH: Yes!
-Well, okay, then.

375
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,712
{\an8}4:00?
(yawns)

376
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,879
Couple hours, I have
to get up and go to work.

377
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,419
Got to go to work.

378
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,842
Go to work...

379
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,171
(snoring)

380
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,085
MR. BURNS:
Ooh, look at them, Smithers--

381
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,344
goldbrickers,

382
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,795
lay abouts,

383
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:28,835
slugabeds.

384
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,638
Little do they realize

385
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,601
their days of suckling
at my teat are numbered.

386
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,846
Oh, in the meantime, sir,
may I suggest a random firing,

387
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,308
just to throw
the fear of God into them?

388
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,147
Very well.

389
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,862
Eeny, meeny, miny--
Ugh! Him!

390
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,034
SMITHERS (on PA):
<i>Attention, Homer Simpson.</i>

391
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,952
<i>Attention, Homer Simpson.</i>

392
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,122
<i>Wake up, Homer.</i>

393
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,740
<i>What? Huh? What?</i>

394
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,446
-SMITHERS: <i>You're fired.</i>
<i>-For what?</i>

395
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,746
SMITHERS:
<i>For sleeping on the job.</i>

396
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,409
How did you know
I was sleeping?

397
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,038
SMITHER:
<i>We've been watching you</i>

398
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,084
<i>on the surveillance camera.</i>

399
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,917
<i>Camera?</i>
<i>D-ohhh!</i>

400
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,132
Smithers.

401
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,592
To the laboratory.

402
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,592
(thunderclap)

403
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,101
You know, Smithers

404
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,519
I've always despised
the laziness

405
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,888
of the common worker.

406
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,475
Then I realized
his spirit was willing

407
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,940
but the flesh was weak.

408
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,610
So I replaced the flesh,
which is weak,

409
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,399
with steel,
which is strong.

410
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,902
Behold!

411
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,324
The greatest breakthrough
in labor relations

412
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,783
since
the cat o' nine tails!

413
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,907
How long till it's
up and running, sir?

414
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,704
Keep your pants on,
Smithers.

415
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,907
First we need...

416
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,827
a human brain.

417
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,246
Hey, here's
a good job, Dad.

418
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,835
{\an8}Oh, wait. You have to know
how to operate

419
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,880
{\an8}an ultrasonic
lithontriptor.

420
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,383
How hard can it be?

421
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,884
Hey, Dad, here's one.

422
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,926
$28 an hour,
plenty of fresh air

423
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,681
and you get to meet
lots of interesting people.

424
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,353
Ooh, what job is that?

425
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,232
Gravedigger.

426
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,598
(diabolical laugh)

427
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,727
(grunting)

428
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,613
Deeper, wider, faster.

429
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,941
I wouldn't bury my turtle
in that mud puddle.

430
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,237
What's the use?

431
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,529
Sheesh!
What a slave driver.

432
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,873
(yawning)

433
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,699
(snoring)

434
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,285
(howling)

435
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,750
What corpse
should we unearth, sir?

436
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,464
I don't know.

437
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,804
I feel like a kid
in a candy store.

438
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,630
Hello!

439
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,085
An open grave.

440
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,005
Smithers,
get him out quickly.

441
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,683
The stench is overpowering.

442
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,472
Wait a minute, sir.
That's Homer Simpson.

443
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,096
He wasn't exactly
a model employee.

444
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,523
Well, who is a model...

445
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:42,642
employee?

446
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,858
(shuddering)

447
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,108
Simpson will do just fine, sir.

448
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,690
(grunting)

449
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,486
Did you hear that, sir?

450
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,739
No, I didn't.

451
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,410
Who is it,
Frankenstein?

452
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,029
The Boogerman?

453
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,735
It's the man in the bag, sir.
I think he's alive.

454
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,786
Oh.

455
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,199
Bad corpse. Bad corpse.

456
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,247
(muffled scream)

457
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,790
Stop scaring Smithers.

458
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:03,923
Satisfied?

459
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,419
Thank you, sir.

460
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,377
(whirring)

461
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,842
Excellent.

462
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,257
Smithers, hand me
that ice cream scoop.

463
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,256
Ice cream scoop?

464
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,097
Damn it, Smithers!

465
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,892
This isn't rocket science,
it's brain surgery!

466
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,226
All right.

467

471
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,303
Look, Smithers--
a twitch.

472
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,974
It's moving!

473
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,512
It's alive!

474
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,845
Oh, that fellow at Radio Shack
said I was mad.

475
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,642
Well, who's mad now?

It's your father--

00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,547
Dad's missing?
Get out of here.

486
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,434
He's been gone for two days.

{\an8}What do you know?
She's right.

488
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:46,518
It wasn't supposed
to be this way.

489
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,692
It was supposed to be
a thing of beauty,

490
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,401
not this abomination.

Oh, Smithers,
I was wrong to play God.

Life is precious,

494
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,908
not a thing
to be toyed with.

495
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,280
Now take out that brain
and flush it down the toilet.

496
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,697
Sir, his family
might appreciate it

497
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,155
if you returned the brain
to his body.

498
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:09,036
Oh, come on. It's 11:45!

499
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,540
Oh, Smithers
when you look at me

500
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,338
with those puppy dog eyes...

501
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,341
All right.

502
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,680
Ow... ow...
ow... ow...

503
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,391
Oh, will you
quit your complaining.

504
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,221
Sir, do you know
what this means?

505
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,516
He is alive.

506
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,979
Ooh, you're right,
Smithers.

507
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,809
I guess
I owe you a Coke.

508
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,104
And as for you

509
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,977
you clinking, clattering
cacophony

00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,154

Aahh!

513
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,411
Run, sir.

514
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,699
(panting)

515
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,413
Every bone... shattered,

516
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,254
organs...
leaking vital fluids,

517
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,460
a slight headache,
loss of appetite.

518
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:55,171
Smithers, I'm going to die.

519
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,054
Sir, is there nothing I can do?

520
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,130
Well, perhaps.

521
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,255
Smithers,
go to my office.

522
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,262
In the third drawer
of my desk are...

523
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,805
surgical tools...
and some ether.

524
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,349
Aaaaaaaaaaaahhh!

525
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,143
Did you have
a nightmare, Homie?

526
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,397
No, Bart bit me.

527
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,978
{\an8}Hey, man,
you were crushing me.

528
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,403
{\an8}I tried to scream,
but my mouth was full of flab.

529
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,532
Got to go shake the dew
off the lily.

530
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,489
Aahh!

531
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,240
Perhaps you're wondering
why you have two heads.

532
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,123
Well, my body was crushed,
so I had my head grafted onto

533
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,371
your, shall we say,
ample frame.

534
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,913
I can wake up.
