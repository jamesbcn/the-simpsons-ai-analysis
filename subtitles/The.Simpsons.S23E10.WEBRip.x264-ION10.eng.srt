{\an8}Yes, but I never use
that kind of toothpaste!

I carry my stress.

we're here with this guy

176
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,375
{\an8}my kid said was a thing:
Homer Simpson.

177
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,512
{\an8}-Whoo-hoo! I'm famous again!
-Yes,

178
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,799
{\an8}<i>your video has been mashed-up,</i>

179
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,432
{\an8}<i>Auto-Tuned, Jimmy Falloned,</i>

180
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,259
{\an8}<i>Philippine prisonered,</i>

181
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,434
{\an8}and occasionally even watched.

182
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,682
{\an8}Ha! But can you save America
from its last savior?

183
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,675
{\an8}-Adriatica Vel Johnson.
-Nash.

184
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,387
{\an8}In this
kicked-in-the-teeth world,

185
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:19,307
{\an8}what we don't need
is another blustering bloat bag

186
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,437
{\an8}who claims to speak for Bubba
and Britney Spray-Cheese.

187
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,475
{\an8}That's really smart.

188
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,778
{\an8}That's like something
I would say.

189
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,901
{\an8}Precisely, Nash.

190
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,447
{\an8}That's a great point,
Adriatica.

191
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,450
{\an8}Well, if I could explain myself...

192
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,622
{\an8}-Head butt!
-(groans)

193
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,950
{\an8}We'll be right back after this.

194
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,156
Come here, you.

195
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,866
(moaning, giggling)

196
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,166
Homie, you can win
this argument.

197
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,210
Just rant and rave like you do
to the TV during sports.

198
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,426
Yes. Yes. Got it!

199
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,267
DIRECTOR:
Uh, five seconds to air.

200
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,178
{\an8}(clears throat)

201
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,726
{\an8}And we're back
with Homer Simpson,

202
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,849
{\an8}who's about to become
a soggy Pamper

203
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:02,396
{\an8}flung to the side of history's
freeway in three, two...

204
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,942
{\an8}-Not so fast!
-(gasps)

205
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,695
{\an8}Now, I may not be some
mani-pedied TV blowhard,

206
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,658
{\an8}but I do speak
for the common man

207
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,829
{\an8}who does his lousy job,
goes to church twice a year,

208
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,329
{\an8}and watches women's tennis

209
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,330
{\an8}'cause he likes
to hear them grunt.

210
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,872
{\an8}I bet Chuck the cameraman
and Steve the sound guy

211
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,076
{\an8}know where I'm coming from.

212
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,000
{\an8}Yeah, that's what I'm
talking about.

213
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,127
{\an8}Those real people out there

214
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,675
{\an8}who buy their coffee
from the mini-mart

215
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,009
{\an8}and grab enough sugar packs
for a week.

216
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,144
{\an8}Honest, hardworking,
sugar-stealing Americans!

217
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,723
-(crew cheering)
-DIRECTOR: Cut.

218
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,227
Nash, I'm scared.

219
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,059
Find me a rich
husband-- quick!

220
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,734
Dad, you out-talked
the talking heads.

221
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,273
From now on,
when someone asks me,

222
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,567
I'm going to say you are
my father.

223
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,861
Aw, son.

224
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,994
Now I regret bad-mouthing you
to that girl you liked.

225
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,992
Homer,
the way you just demolished

226
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,334
our number-one
on-air personality was...

227
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,000
fantastic!

228
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,499
You are the kind
of ill-informed gasbag

229
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,461
this network
cannot get enough of.

230
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,792
We only have 11 now.

231
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,746
Not to mention
our liberal straw man.

232
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,126
<i>♪ Oh, the plain</i>
<i>and simple facts is ♪</i>

233
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,844
<i>♪ I'd love to raise your taxes ♪</i>

234
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,394
<i>♪ And make your</i>
<i>children gay... ♪</i>

235
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,218
But what we don't
have is someone

236
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,893
who speaks
to the average American.

237
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,812
Your flyover Franks,
your dirt-bike Daryls.

238
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,271
How can you refer
to your audience that way?

239
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,352
Well, what you do is take

240
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,186
a derogatory term
and think of other words

241
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,862
-that start with the same letter.
-Hmm.

242
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,360
Homer, you're getting
your own show.

243
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,611
Finally.

244
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,703
But I want to do it my way:

245
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,448
classy and sophisticated.

246
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,951
Welcome to <i>Gut Check</i>
<i>with Homer Simpson!</i>

247
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:40,163
<i>Where the truth is served</i>
<i>with a side of... in your face.</i>

248
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,879
I am Homer Simpson.

249
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,261
(chickens clucking)

250
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,468
America's latest teller of truth
with a book deal on the side.

251
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,220
Audio book read by Lenny.

252
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,352
I'm not just another loudmouth.

253
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,719
I'm a loudmouth who says things
you're afraid to say,

254
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,977
but not racist things!

255
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,811
Let's go to the map.

256
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,645
{\an8}Zoomy, zoomy, zoomy.

257
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,731
{\an8}Dateline: Nebraska.

258
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,896
A high school principal
has decided

259
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,105
that football is too dangerous,

260
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,156
so he's replacing it
with... soccer.

261
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,245
Are you ready
for Irish announcers

262
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,829
with lyrical accents?

263
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,673
"Oh, that's a lovely touch.

264
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,879
Oh, such a beautiful form."

265
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,549
If we lose football,

266
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,509
we lose the blitz, cheerleaders,

267
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,180
Rudys, Ochocincos,

268
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:38,389
something for fat kids to play.

269
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,141
(sobbing)

270
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,272
Ochocincos.

271
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,480
(sobbing)

272
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,437
Oh, yeah, that's right.

273
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,612
It's already happening, people.

274
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,030
Hoard your toilet paper.

275
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,529
Shoot the mailman!

276
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,611
(sobbing)
Shoot the mailman.

277
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,117
Is it a little weird
how much he cries?

278
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,700
No way. When a guy
who loves America cries,

279
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,446
it makes him super straight.

280
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,036
This is going so great.

281
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,793
I'm already
a Halloween mask!

282
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,674
That's not you.

283
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,634
They just painted Shrek yellow.

284
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,967
It's still a great honor.

285
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,141
Dad, I'm glad your show
is successful,

286
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,640
but I have to ask you:
what's with the crying?

287
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,273
Great question.

288
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,650
I know you children have never
seen your father cry before.

289
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,268
Marge, do we have
any more gravy?

290
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,645
No, we're out.

291
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,151
(sobbing)
Why?

292
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,823
Oh, why?!

293
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,413
Homie, I'm glad
you're passionate,

294
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,408
I just hope you're not
riling people up with your show.

295
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,541
Oh, Marge, don't worry.

296
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,658
People know
I'm doing a character,

297
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:48,075
like Stephen Colbert
or Newt Gingrich.

298
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,670
Welcome back
to <i>Gut Check.</i>

299
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:55,462
I have something very, very
pro-American to share with you.

300
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,628
Come with me.

301
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,376
D'oh!
Death to America!

302
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,757
I mean, over here.

303
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,974
You all know I'm a big fan
of American meat.

304
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,774
Although, sometimes you got
to cut off some of the gristle.

305
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,520
(roars)

306
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,062
Take that,
centers of art and commerce!

307
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,727
And this country has something
extra that makes our meat

308
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,186
the juiciest,
most melt-in-your-mouth,

309
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,357
stay-in-your-heart meat
in the world.

310
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:22,526
That's right, I'm talking about
the gravy of freedom.

311
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,748
When March Madness spills
into April, that's the gravy.

312
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,120
When someone messes with you,

313
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,326
and you invade the country
that did it plus another one,

314
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,958
that's the gravy.

315
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,214
When you stick your flag
in the moon

316
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:41,137
and say "Now we're done trying,"
that's the gravy!

317
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,468
So get on the boat.

318
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,224
The gravy boat!

319
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,476
Good night and good gravy.

320
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,979
Great show, people.
Great show.

321
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,771
Um... not a big deal,
but next time,

322
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,186
can we use real gravy
instead of brown paint?

323
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,605
Not a big deal.

324
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,323
So, what's this
with the gravy boat?

325
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,534
Just an innocuous little symbol,

326
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,575
like a smiley face
or like an I.O.U.

327
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,579
You know, symbols can often
rile people up.

328
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,582
The swastika,
the New York Yankees logo.

329
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,915
(laughs)
Oh. Don't worry, sweetie.

330
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,551
I think I know how
to whip up an audience

331
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,919
just short of a frenzy.

332
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,435
(clamoring)

333
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,530
Why did I make this
a loss leader?

334
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,238
The gravy boat movement
is spreading across the nation

335
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,786
like a rumor about
some kid and someone's mom

336
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,160
hooking up at a high school.

337
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,077
With the presidential primaries
coming up

338
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,915
and an entrenched incumbent
in office,

339
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,250
Republican leaders
have no choice but to court

340
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:01,546
this movement's inglorious
baster, Homer Simpson.

341
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,472
Marge, I'm going to meet with

342
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,261
the Republican establishment
and pick their nominee.

343
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,635
If there's sandwiches there,
you want me to bring some back?

344
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,773
Speaking for Lisa and me,

345
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,351
we're not really
110% behind you anymore.

346
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,767
Then what percent above 100
are you behind me?

347
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,937
Um, none.

348
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,534
Only 100%?!
(groans)

349
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,070
Homie, I love you,

350
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,783
and I'm glad we're finally
using our wedding china,

351
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,195
but when you're helping to pick

352
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,793
the next leader
of the free world...

353
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,079
Dad, you shouldn't do this.

354
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,541
It's not fair
how much influence you have.

355
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,212
Now, Lisa,
I'm an entertainer.

356
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,462
And you can't entertain
and inform at the same time.

357
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,415
And if you're <i>Access Hollywood,</i>
you do neither.

358
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,165
(chuckles)

359
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,046
{\an8}(thunder rumbles)

360
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,886
Hmm. Hmm.

361
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,932
Now, they're all
excellent choices,

362
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,556
so simply pick the white male
candidate you prefer

363
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,643
and we'll elect him.

364
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,858
I don't know. Can't we get
Chris Christie to run?

365
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,609
I don't think so.

366
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,359
(choking)

367
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,905
Save me, ObamaCare!

368
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,579
Yeah, maybe I'll vote Democrat.

369
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,448
The great thing is,
when they get in,

370
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,905
they act like Republicans.

371
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,575
MAN: No one's voting Democrat
while I can still draw a bow.

372
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,075
(gasps)

373
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,749
(gasps)

374
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,916
Ted Nugent.

375
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,465
I made love on my honeymoon
to your sweet music.

376
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,930
You're my man!

377
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,010
You're endorsing Ted Nugent
for president?

378
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,176
He's a right-wing rock star
who likes everything I hate!

379
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,186
Could there be anyone awesomer?

380
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,848
Who's hungry for elk?

381
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,517
(screams)

382
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,936
Hmm.

383
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,284
My daughter's a vegetarian.

384
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,490
That's all right,
she can munch on an antler.

385
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,530
Antlers ain't meat.

386
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,039
I thought I smelled
death-a-diddly.

387
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,580
What is that,
an eight-pointer?

388
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,874
From the looks
of that mustache,

389
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,577
I'm guessing you're
a tenured professor

390
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,417
at the People's Republic
of Berkeley.

391
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,422
Hey, the only left-wing thing
about me is the way I write.

392
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,625
(grunts)
Oh, that's just fine,

393
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,005
as long as you're
not a Mormon.

394
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,763
Dad, you cannot
endorse Ted Nugent.

395
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,425
I mean, sure,
we all love his music...

396
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,604
-Oh, yeah.
-No question about it.

397
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,892
-I love that guy.
-We listen to it.

398
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,055
But he's out of his mind!

399
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,772
He can't run for president!

400
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,852
I bagged me a fat little badger.

401
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,518
Please, kind sir, have pity.

402
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,187
All I hear is
"chitter-chitter."

403
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,452
(snoring)

404
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,946
(snoring)

405
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,825
MAN:
Arise, Homer Simpson!

406
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,372
Huh? Who's there?

407
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,498
(screams)
Mozart!

408
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,804
-I am James Madison, sir.
-(screams)

409
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,378
Fourth president
of these United States.

410
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,764
-Ooh.
-Now, come,

411
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,881
and I shall teach
you of democracy.

412
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,298
Can we get some pizza
on the way?

413
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,546
Everything's closed.

414
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,307
They sell some
at the gas station.

415
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,889
I don't want
gas station pizza.

416
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,646
(whinnies)

417
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,519
So, how come your picture's
not on money?

418
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,776
Actually,
I'm on the $5,000 bill.

419
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,489
Do you give them out
for fans?

420
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,489
'Cause I'm a fan.

421
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,120
I want to show you something.

422
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,201
What's this?

423
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,786
Some kind of
bicentennial lemon party?

424
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,212
These are the framers
of the Constitution, Homer.

425
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,091
This great nation is built upon
the hard work of,

426
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,379
well, as you would say, nerds.

427
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,553
Nerds!

428
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,050
You want I should mess them up?

429
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,302
I want you
should not mess!

430
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,104
You are an embarrassment
to the aristocratic slaveholders

431
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,889
who forged this mighty nation.

432
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,972
But gravy
is the freedom where...

433
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,558
Silence!
Founding Fathers, to me!

434
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,148
(grunting)

435
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,069
(gasps)

436
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,568
"Congress shall have the power
to lay and collect taxes"?!

437
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,571
"No new states shall be formed

438
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,613
"or erected
within the jurisdiction

439
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,657
of any other state"?!

440
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,412
No, no, John Hancock.

441
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,754
I don't need insurance.

442
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,748
Sam Adams, I'm sorry
I made fun of your winter ale.

443
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:03,791
Homie, wake up.

444
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,674
(gasps)
It was all a dream.

445
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,051
Oh, Marge,
Oscar Madison came to me

446
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:11,798
and told me that politics
are serious and important!

447
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:12,802
(yawns)

448
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,053
Lisa, you were right!

449
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:17,224
I'm not going to endorse
anybody for anything.

450
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,474
(kids screaming)

451
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,397
(muffled grunting)

452
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,899
Oh, Dad!

453
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,480
I'm so glad you've heard
the voice of reason.

454
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,896
Yes, the will of the people
should not be subverted

455
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,316
by demagogues who--
hey, what's this?

456
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,825
"Springfield Colonial Village"?

457
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,246
What the...?
You faked it!

458
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,500
Lisa, how could you?

459
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,422
It wasn't just her, Homie.

460
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,421
It was all of us.

461
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,592
I did it just to mess
with your mind.

462
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,131
That's what a play
within a play is for!

463
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,625
(choking)

464
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,176
No strangling
on school days!

465
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,351
Well, if there's one thing
I don't like being taught,

466
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,600
it's a lesson!

467
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,642
I'm so mad.

468
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,635
Not only will I endorse
Ted Nugent,

469
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:10,187
but I will call for an end
to the direct election of senators!

470
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,694
Dad, no!

471
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,855
Really?
That made sense?

472
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,363
Then I'm definitely doing it.

473
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,867
Folks, because I love
democracy so much,

474
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,080
I command you
to vote for this man

475
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,871
whom I alone have selected
as your next president.

476
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:28,455
Now to baptize his candidacy
with my tears.

477
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:32,802
The words "strutting stadium rocker"
are overused these days,

478
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,130
but when I first
met Ted Nugent...

479
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,176
(gasps)

480
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,589
Uh, huh?

481
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,257
My emotions were
so powerful.

482
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,885
Come on, hurry up and cry
so I can get elected

483
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,813
and open up the San Diego Zoo
for big game hunting.

484
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,193
(grunting)

485
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,523
It's not working. But why?

486
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,897
Maybe because,
deep down,

487
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,153
you know you don't believe
in what you're doing.

488
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,895
Oh, my God, she's right.

489
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:00,907
My lips will say anything,
but my eyes know the truth!

490
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,291
My ears are
keeping their mouth shut.

491
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:10,747
My fellow Americans,
I am full of crap.

492
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,634
I knew you were, Dad.

493
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,421
(sobbing)

494
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,304
I always knew!

495
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,091
(sobbing)

496
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:22,215
Well, for one brief, glorious moment,
I was almost president,

497
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,434
sort of, not really.

498
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,353
