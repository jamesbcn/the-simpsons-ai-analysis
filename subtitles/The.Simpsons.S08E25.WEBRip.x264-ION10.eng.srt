movies are a nice break,

I just don't feel challenged.

68
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,157
Of course, we can make things
more challenging, Lisa,

69
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,504
but then the stupider students
would be in here complaining,

70
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,750

in a vain attempt

71
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,712

75
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,380

You're in for the punishment
of a lifetime!

102
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,345
When do you expect
the ringing will stop?

103
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,220
In about ten to 15 seconds.

104
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,018
I certainly hope so!

105
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,481

-Ooh! That's better.

106
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,902
(pops)

107
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,320
Now, about your punishment,
young man.

108
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,149
I know. I'll go to my room
and think about what I did.

109
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,315
Oh, no. Your room
is full of toys.

110
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,155
You're going
to the, uh, garage.

111
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,370
You're the boss.

112
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,331
I tell you, Chief,

113
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,001
I just don't know what
we're going to do with him.

114
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,289
You know,
you do have options.

115
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,094
For example, there are
behavior-modifying drugs.

116
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,879
How wedded are you
to the Bart you know?

117
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:42,553
-Not very.
-No. No drugs.

118
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,893
Bart just needs
a little discipline.

119
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,639
Hey, what about military school?

120
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,221
It set my brother straight.

121
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,846
Now he owns and operates
a famous cave.

122
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:54,023
Hmm. You know,
maybe Chief Wiggum is right.

123
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:59,653
Military school is a good idea.

124
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,364
-(motor whirring)
-(siren yelps)

125
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:16,001
Wow! I can't believe
we're going to Disneyland.

126
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,674
Hey, where's all your luggage?

127
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,550
-Hurray!
-Oh, yeah!

128
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,381
You dream about this day
for so long.

129
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,587
Then when it comes,
you don't know
what to say.

130
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,217
Shh, shh, shh.

131
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,894
Edna, your tears say
more than words ever could.

132
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,274
(choking)
Military school?

133
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,902
You lied to me.

134
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:39,398
Well, I'm sorry
if you heard Disneyland,

135
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,982
but I distinctly said
military school.

136
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,871
And that's how
we'll mold your boy

137
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,043
into a productive
member of society--

138
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,332
through an intensive program

139
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,705
of push-ups
and formation marching.

140
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,672
Well, it certainly
was nice of you

141
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,262
to accept Bart
in the middle
of the semester.

142
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,298
Fortunately, we've had
a couple of recent freak-outs.

143
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,762
So that freed up
a couple of bunks.

144
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,553
-Freak-outs?
-If that happens,

145
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,467
are we still charged
for the entire semester?

146
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,596
Our high standards
challenge students

147
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,443
to reach their full potential.

148
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,558
Look at how disciplined
they are.

149
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,015
They're just like
the terra-cotta
warriors of Xian.

150
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,526
They sure are.

151
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,858
Ow!

152
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,403
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

153
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,027
That's not
so disciplined.

154
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,414
They're just children,
Mr. Simpson.

155
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,330
Pww! I guess.

156
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,619
Truth is beauty,
beauty truth, sir!

157
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,873
(gasps)
They're discussing poetry.

158
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,245
Oh! We never do that
at my school.

159
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,672
But the truth can be
harsh and disturbing.

160
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,751
How can that be
considered beautiful?

161
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,717
Oh, they sure sucked
the fun out of that poem.

162
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,178
Please don't make me stay, Dad.

163
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,678
I'll do anything you say.

164
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,049
I'll find religion;
I'll be good, sometimes.

165
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,136
-Let go of my leg.
-No!

166
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,391
Son, for the last time
you're staying
at military school.

167
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,425
And so am I.

168
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,937
(gasps)

169
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,690
This school has everything
I ever wanted.

170
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,612
Lisa, no!

171
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,571
This place is just
a jail for children.

172
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,321
No jail can hold me.

173
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,456
All right, let's go
over this one more time,

174
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,672
just to make sure
I understand the situation.

175
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,633
(clearing throat)

176
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,673
You're a girl?

177
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,877
-Yes.
-Oh, gosh darn it.

178
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,797
I just don't understand
the situation.

179
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,756
(clearing throat)

180
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,306
You're a girl.

181
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,889
All I want is a chance
to prove myself.

182
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,725
Hmm.

183
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:44,190
In our 185 years, we have
never had a female cadet.

184
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,693
Oh, but that seems
to be the way

185
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,735
the wind is blowing
these days.

186
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:51,608
After all,
we have female singers...

187
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,077
female motorists.

188
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,368
Hmm.

189
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,081
Welcome aboard.

190
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,582
Lisa, if you ever want
to quit and come home,

191
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,875
I'll be here in half a jif.

192
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,959
I want to quit and come home.

193
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,883
I want to quit and come home.

194
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,843
Oh, honey,
I heard you the first time.

195
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:10,884
(kisses)

196
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,273
Atten-hut!

197
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,444
Gentlemen, we now have
a girl cadet among our ranks,

198
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,194
so we're going to have
to make a few changes.

199
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,857
First of all, Franklin,

200
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,485
you are no longer
the girliest cadet here.

201
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,952
Well, we'll see about that.

202
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,292
Second, this is now
the girls' barracks.

203
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,788
So pack your things.
You're moving in
with company "L."

204
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,120
Company "L"?
But they smell.

205
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,416
Yes, we've all
heard the chant.

206
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,959
Now, fall out!

207
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,422
Sorry. Sorry.

208
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,842
I know we'll be friends.

209
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,051
Talk about getting off
on the wrong foot.

210
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,342
(nervous chuckle)

211
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,974
I can't believe
they let a girl in.

212
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:59,103
Don't worry. We'll drive her
out of the academy.

213
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,811
That is why God created hazing.

214
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,152
(thunder rumbling)

215
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,978
(grunting)

216
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,449
What's the matter?

217
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,529
Don't girls like doing
push-ups in the mud?

218
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,985
Is there any answer
I can give

219
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,584
that won't result
in more push-ups?

220
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,200
(all whispering)

221
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,538
No.

222
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,343
Hey, look,
it's the school motto.

223
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,880
"I'll die before
I surrender, Tim."

224
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,553
Who's Tim?

225
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,722
Apparently, Tim was somebody
who was with the general

226
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,761
moments before he was shot
in the head.

227
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,215
Cleaning graffiti
off a statue

228
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,135
makes a mockery
of everything I stand for.

229
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,684
I don't think I can
survive here, Lise.

230
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,348
That's how they want you
to feel.

231
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,806
But if you just hang
in there,

232
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,226
they'll eventually
accept you.

233
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,984
Get to work!

234
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,686
I want to see my face
in that horse's ass.

235
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,775
Okay, that's long enough.

236
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,115
Let's see how they're doing.

237
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,250
Had enough?

238
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,791
(both groaning)

239
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,246
What's say you, men?

240
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,756
Has this lowly maggot
passed the test?

241
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,378
Congratulations, Bart.
You made it.

242
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,927
Hey, what about me?
I'm a lowly maggot.

243
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,685
(gunfire)

244
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,438
Well, since you attended
public school,

245
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,360
I'm going to assume that

246
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,018
you're already proficient
with small arms.

247
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,647
So we'll start you off
with something

248
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:36,113
-a little more advanced.
-(nervous chuckle)

249
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,794
Four out of five, Simpson--
impressive.

250
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,291
But you missed your last target.

251
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,503
Did I?

252
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,293
Ha-ha!

253
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,668
You're a born
soldier, Simpson.

254
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,545
Too bad it doesn't run
in your family.

255
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,222
Uh, could someone help me?

256
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,302
It's stuck on "auto fire."

257
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:06,058
-Brad, you hear anything?!
-No!

258
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,732
(gun clicking)

259
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,100
(panting)

260
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,227
Maybe you should
just learn to use this.

261
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,444
If there's a war,
just blow on it,

262
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,775
and I'll come
help you.

263
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,033
(touch-tones beeping)

264
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,123
I am just calling home.

265
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,238
I am not asking to come home.

266
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,075
(phone ringing)

267
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,411
(ringing)

268
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,416
Marge! You got that?

269
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,329
-Marge!
-(yelps)

270
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,458
Hey, go on, boy.

271
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,455
Go get it.

272
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,456
Answer the phone.

273
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,467
D'oh!

274
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,929
There's got to
be something

275
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,679
on this thing
for that thing.

276
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,641
-(ringing stops)
-Ahh.

277
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,181
-(groans)
-(phone ringing)

278
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,806
-Simpson.
-Hot diggity!

279
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,984
I don't care if it's bad news.

280
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,152
Oh, Grampa,
you're not busy, are you?

281
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,741
Well, you're really asking
two questions there.

282
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,488
The first one takes me
back to 1934.

283
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,531
Admiral Byrd had just
reached the pole

284
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,365
only hours ahead
of the three stooges.

285
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,371
And I guess
he won the argument,

286
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,503
but I walked away
with the turnips.

287
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,960
The following morning,

288
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,540
I resigned my commission
in the Coast Guard.

289
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,586
The next thing I heard,
there was civil war in Spain.

290
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,010
And that's everything
that happened in my life

291
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,720
right up to the time
I got this phone call.

292
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,472
Uh-huh. So, anything else
you wanna talk about?

293
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:29,354
Oh, I'm afraid I'd just be
repeating myself, honey.

294
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,983
(groans)

295
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,190
Anyway, other people need
to use the phone.

296
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,940
ALL: Mm-mmm.

297
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,272
I've already talked to her
for 20 damn minutes.

298
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,227
(groans)

299
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,317
Hmm? Oh!

300
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,494
(laughing, chattering)

301
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,533
BOY: You're all right.

302
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,576
Shh.

303
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,584
What is it?

304
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,542
Bart, I got a cassette
from Mom and Dad.

305
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,792
I thought we could listen
to it together.

306
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,464
Ah, gee, Lise,
I'd love to

307
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,883
but this really
isn't a good time.

308
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,882
-Bart, who you talking to?
-Uh...

309
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,514
Lisa. You're talking to Lisa.

310
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,841
I'm talking to...

311
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,046
No one.

312
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,314
All right, lights out!

313
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,893
(thud)

314
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,058
Ow! Damn it!

315
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,685
Lights on. Lights on.

316
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,652
Lights out. Lights out.

317
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,782
(door slams)

318
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,525
MARGE:
<i>And don't worry, sweetie.</i>

319
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,623
<i>It's very common</i>
<i>to be homesick</i>

320
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,950
<i>when you're so far away from</i>
<i>the people who love you.</i>

321
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,956
Okay,
I'm not going to give up.

322
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,919
Solitude never hurt anyone.

323
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,790
Emily Dickinson lived alone,

324
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,627
and she wrote some
of the most beautiful poetry

325
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,553
the world has ever known--

326
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,342
hmm-- and went crazy
as a loon.

327
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,387
(tape rewinds)

328
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,100
MARGE:
<i>♪ You are my sunshine,</i>
<i>my only sunshine ♪</i>

329
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:57,313
<i>♪ You make me happy</i>
<i>when skies are gray ♪</i>

330
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:02,316
<i>♪ You'll never know, dear,</i>
<i>how much I love you ♪</i>

331
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:06,491
<i>♪ So don't take</i>
<i>my sunshine away ♪</i>

332
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,291
Sorry I froze you out, Lise.

333
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,249
I just didn't want
the guys to think

334
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,790
I'd gone soft
on the girl issue.

335
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,883
I'm tired of
being an issue, Bart.

336
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,498
Maybe everyone would be
better off if I just quit.

337
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,166
But if you quit,
it'd be like

338
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,764
an expert knot-tier quitting
a knot-tying contest

339
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,340
right in the middle
of tying a knot.

340
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,045
Why'd you say that?

341
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,135
I don't know.
I was looking at my shoelaces.

342
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,890
Look, the point is
you're going to make it, Lise,

343
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:32,892
and I'm gonna stick by you.

344
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,183
Don't do that.

345
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,016
Why should we both be outcasts?

346
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,191
Then I'll just stick
by you in secret

347
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,650
like a sock-maker secretly
working on a top secret sock--

348
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,271
will you stop looking
at your feet?

349
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,988
Well, cadets,
it's been a great year.

350
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,319
You've all worked
very hard developing

351
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,574
academic skills
and general killing skills.

352
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,487
My killing teacher says
I'm a natural.

353
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:55,615
But these skills are nothing
without courage and stamina.

354
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,924
Traditionally, the academy
tested these virtues

355
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,749
by pitting you
against each other

356
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,844
in a two-day Battle Royale.

357
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,840
-(all gasp)
-That was prior to 1957.

358
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,513
Thank you very much,
State Supreme Court.

359
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,432
Consequently now, no cadet
can receive a passing grade

360
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:15,312
for the academic year
without first conquering this.

361
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,271
Meet "The Eliminator."

362
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,771
That's a 150-foot
hand-over-hand crawl

363
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:23,113
across a 60-gauge hemp-jute line
with a blister factor of 12.

364
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,110
The rope is suspended
a full 40 feet

365
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:29,863
over a solid British acre
of old-growth Connecticut Valley
thorn bushes.

366
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:33,237
Gentlemen,
welcome to Flavor Country.

367
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,985
This wasn't in the brochure.

368
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,197
(overlapping chatter)

369
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,584
Hey, Bart, come on over here.
There's plenty of room.

370
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:47,054
"Meet me at the Eliminator
after lights out.

371
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,761
"P.S.--
The cadets are planning

372
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,801
to throw their meatballs
at you."

373
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,264
Hmm.

374
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:58,564
(groans)

375
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,812
That's it, Lise.
Now start crawling.

376
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:05,324
Oh, it's too hard.
My hand is slipping.

377
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,149
(screams)

378
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,532
I can't do this, Bart.
I'm not strong enough.

379
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,945
I thought you came here
looking for a challenge.

380
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,785
Duh. A challenge I could do.

381
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,542
It was worth
sneaking into town.

382
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,423
That was some good corn.

383
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,590
Uh-oh.

384
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,799
Uh, hey, Simpson.
What are you doing out here?

385
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,881
-Nothing.
-Nothing?
Doesn't look like nothing.

386
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,507
Oh, yeah?
Well... um...

387
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,095
What are you doing out here?

388
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,600
Uh... also nothing.

389
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,393
Well.

390
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,597
Okay.

391
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,606
-Okay.
-Then carry on.

392
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,648
All right, we will.

393
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,317
(sighs)
That was close.

394
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,152
Bees.

395
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,907
Bees.

396
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,949
BART: Bees? Aah!

397
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,373
-(screaming)
-(body thuds)

398
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,121
Gentlemen,
I regret to inform you

399
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,584
that the State Supreme Court
has determined

400
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,084
that forcing cadets
to cross the eliminator

401
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,457
is a barbaric
and malicious practice.

402
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,964
-Yes!
-Hence, you will be
the last class

403
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,588
to be subjected to it.

404
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,434
Anderson, you're up.

405
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,590
(yelling)

406
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,062
Son of a...

407
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,646
Jeez.

408
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,321
-(sighs)
-Good job, Simpson.

409
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,490
Although that's more cursing
than I like to hear

410
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,949
from a cadet in peace time.

411
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,029
Last up...

412
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,826
Simpson, Lisa.

413
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,963
(playing "Taps")

414
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,682
(shouting insults)

415
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,430
Well, at least
they're talking to me.

416
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,676
(gasps)

417
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,937
(crow caws)

418
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,568
Oh.

419
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,316
(sighs)

420
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,698
If only I were in Springfield,

421
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:25,075
all my friends would be
cheering me on.

422
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,884
Oh, God, I'm delirious.

423
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,339
-(screaming)
-(cheering)

424
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,670
-(chanting)
-(straining)

425
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,335
Drop, drop, drop,

426
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,014
drop, drop, drop,
drop, drop, drop...

427
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,643
(chanting continues)

428
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,693
You can make it, Lisa.
I know you can.

429
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,188
Come on,
I know you can do it.

430
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,060
Just get your hands
back on the rope.

431
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,897
It's just a little further.

432
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,532
Come on, just a little bit more.
You're doing great.

433
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,110
That's it. Come on,
just a little bit more.

434
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,565
I know you can do it!
I believe in you!

435
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,503
Yes!

436
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,042
You thought I couldn't,

437
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,835
but I could, I did,
and I could do it again.

438
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,919
Let's do it again!

439
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,764
Lisa, it's over;
you made it.

440
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,259
You can put your arms down.

441
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,431
I can't. They're stuck.

442
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,429
We're going to make
your life a living hell

443
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,261
for the rest of the semester.

444
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,427
But graduation's in three hours.

445
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,476
Oh, we better go change.

446
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,850
-♪♪ (fanfare plays)
-The wars of the future

447
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,938
will not be fought
on a battlefield or at sea.

448
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,444
They will be fought in space--

449
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,316
or possibly on top
of a very tall mountain.

450
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,074
In either case,
most of the actual fighting

451
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,617
will be done by small robots,

452
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,660
and as you go forth today,
remember always,

453
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:51,535
your duty is clear,
to build and maintain
those robots.

454
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,585
-Thank you.
-(cheering)

455
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,047
Well, Bart...

456
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,511
(nervous chuckle)

457
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,681
Did you make sure
to return all the guns?

458
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,800
Sir, yes, sir.
Luckily I am now trained

459
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,717
in six additional forms
of unarmed combat, sir.

460
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:11,597
-Well, he's got more confidence.
-Uh, yeah.

461
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,647
I've always said the boy
could use more confidence.

462
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,991
Lisa, before you go,

463
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,318
I want to present you
with this.

464
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,744
A medal?

465
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:23,953
Thank you, sir.

466
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,832
