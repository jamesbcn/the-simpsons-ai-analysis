1
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,415
<i>Gather round, me buckos</i>

2
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,554
<i>A story I will tell</i>

3
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,390
<i>Of a woman named Lily</i>

4
00:00:28,456 --> 00:00:30,562
<i>Who cast quite a spell</i>

5
00:00:30,628 --> 00:00:32,799
<i>It started back in Britain</i>

6
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,937
<i>It started in a pub...</i>

7
00:00:36,774 --> 00:00:39,312
- She's mine.
- It's my birthday.

8
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:41,316
She's mine.

9
00:00:42,986 --> 00:00:45,692
I can't be the cause of this.

10
00:00:45,758 --> 00:00:47,562
- I'm leaving.
- Your fault!

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,572
<i>We were fighting over Lily,
using knife, fork and club</i>

12
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:55,310
That's all I got.
The rest will be spoken word.

13
00:00:58,049 --> 00:00:59,519
Lily gets why we're here.

14
00:00:59,586 --> 00:01:01,255
Life is supposed to be fun.

15
00:01:01,322 --> 00:01:03,059
I loved her. We all loved her.

16
00:01:03,126 --> 00:01:06,399
The way gophers love
that sweet, sweet poison.

17
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:11,910
Every man wanted her for
the greatest reason there is.

18
00:01:11,977 --> 00:01:14,015
Lily could make life fun.

19
00:01:17,522 --> 00:01:20,628
Now everyone,
hold hands with a stranger.

20
00:01:20,695 --> 00:01:22,374
Oh, pleased to meet you.

21
00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:24,168
How delightful.

22
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:30,247
Lily!

23
00:01:31,817 --> 00:01:35,223
Good one, Lily.

24
00:01:45,177 --> 00:01:46,345
Thanks, Lily!

25
00:01:46,412 --> 00:01:47,782
Pub's back open!

26
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:50,420
But like The Beatles
and balmy weather,

27
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:52,692
she was too hot
for England to handle.

28
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,099
I find you far too alluring
for the average Englishman

29
00:01:56,165 --> 00:02:00,842
and banish you to Britain's
penal colony, America.

30
00:02:03,547 --> 00:02:05,450
This is your captain speaking.

31
00:02:05,518 --> 00:02:08,056
- Will you date me?
- Sorry. No.

32
00:02:08,123 --> 00:02:11,630
Okay. I'm experiencing
some emotional turbulence.

33
00:02:11,697 --> 00:02:13,333
My life is pathetic.

34
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:16,640
Going back and forth,
back and forth.

35
00:02:16,707 --> 00:02:19,679
I don't want to live anymore.

36
00:02:19,746 --> 00:02:24,288
Even the most glamorous movie
stars of Hollywood bored her.

37
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:27,161
Oh, farewell, Leo.
You're a lovely boy,

38
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:30,968
but my heart isn't some CGI bear
for you to conquer.

39
00:02:31,035 --> 00:02:33,574
But I've completely opened
myself up to you.

40
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:36,012
I even admitted I play
the same guy in every role.

41
00:02:36,078 --> 00:02:37,381
Marry me!

42
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:39,051
Oh, maybe I should
go back to England.

43
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:41,155
No. Give this country a chance.

44
00:02:41,222 --> 00:02:42,826
Don't judge us by Hollywood.

45
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:44,563
All right,
but I'm leaving now, dear.

46
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:45,932
You'll have to content yourself

47
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:48,269
with generic supermodels,
I'm afraid.

48
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,842
Nothing ever works out for me.

49
00:02:51,777 --> 00:02:53,313
She needed to get away.

50
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:55,016
Somewhere. Anywhere.

51
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,920
So she threw a dart.

52
00:02:56,987 --> 00:02:58,891
What's next?

53
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:06,205
So she headed to Springfield,

54
00:03:06,272 --> 00:03:09,211
little knowing that its men
had the lowest testosterone,

55
00:03:09,278 --> 00:03:12,719
not counting the Columbia
University football team.

56
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:16,425
Lily wanted peace,
but the best‐laid plans...

57
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:20,433
Can't understand me?
Too bad.

58
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,337
I'm your narrator.

59
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:24,174
Do not tell me...

60
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:31,823
The only thing worse
than when you guys yap

61
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,861
is you sitting here
all quiet and sullen.

62
00:03:33,928 --> 00:03:36,600
I ain't sullen, I'm lachrymose.

63
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,973
Oh, why did I give him
that stupid word‐a‐day calendar?

64
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,377
Impulsinicity?

65
00:03:43,413 --> 00:03:44,749
Excuse me, there, lady,

66
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:46,720
but this is a man's bar.

67
00:03:46,787 --> 00:03:50,995
And I'd like a man's drink.
Bourbon, neat, in a dirty glass.

68
00:03:51,062 --> 00:03:52,665
You got it.

69
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,003
Just got to look up
what neat means.

70
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:58,109
I just don't understand.

71
00:03:58,176 --> 00:03:59,746
Understand what?

72
00:03:59,813 --> 00:04:02,150
What's a pub without a song?

73
00:04:02,217 --> 00:04:07,194
<i>At the pub at the crossroads,
there's whiskey and beer...</i>

74
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,298
There are songs about drinking?

75
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:13,974
<i>There's brandy, strong cognac
that's aging for years</i>

76
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:18,316
<i>But for killing the thirst
and for easing the gout</i>

77
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:22,592
<i>There's nothing at all
beats a pint of good stout</i>

78
00:04:22,658 --> 00:04:25,664
<i>Pint of good stout</i>

79
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,369
Oh, what's that
I hear you asking?

80
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:29,939
Where are the Simpsons?

81
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:32,512
Haven't you heard enough
about the bloody Simpsons

82
00:04:32,578 --> 00:04:34,682
to last a thousand lifetimes?

83
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:36,653
Well, I guess not.

84
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,427
So, Homer is about to receive
an unpleasant surprise.

85
00:04:41,362 --> 00:04:42,799
What a great day.

86
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,270
I've never been so happy.

87
00:04:45,336 --> 00:04:48,109
Nothing can ruin it. Nothing.

88
00:04:48,176 --> 00:04:49,579
What? Where you going?

89
00:04:49,646 --> 00:04:51,248
On our vacation, remember?

90
00:04:51,315 --> 00:04:53,720
My aunt's letting us
use her home at the Vineyard

91
00:04:53,787 --> 00:04:56,192
for three weeks, rent‐free.

92
00:04:56,258 --> 00:04:57,829
How come I'm not coming?

93
00:04:57,895 --> 00:05:00,066
Well, that was
her one condition.

94
00:05:01,837 --> 00:05:04,341
I'm gonna
miss you all so much.

95
00:05:04,408 --> 00:05:05,945
Well, at least
I'll have the dog.

96
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:09,051
Sorry, Dad. We put the pets
with Mr. Flanders

97
00:05:09,118 --> 00:05:12,124
because, well,
we knew he'd take care of them.

98
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:15,798
Come to papa.

99
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:17,502
Good, good.

100
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:18,704
Make‐believe you love him.

101
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,676
Flanders, I love you!

102
00:05:21,743 --> 00:05:24,682
We're staying at my Aunt Edith's
house at Hyannibunkport.

103
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:27,688
It's south of Squibagansett,
east of Codtucket,

104
00:05:27,755 --> 00:05:29,592
next to Little Crabkill Bog.

105
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:32,230
Those are great names.
You'll never want to leave.

106
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:35,704
I'm gonna keep you in my sight
as long as I can.

107
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,732
We love you! Stop following!

108
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:51,302
Okay.

109
00:05:56,947 --> 00:06:00,854
<i>Drink it up,
then throw me out the door</i>

110
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:02,792
<i>I've traveled in England</i>

111
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:05,396
<i>I've traveled in France</i>

112
00:06:05,463 --> 00:06:10,507
<i>At a hint of good music,
I'll sing or I'll dance</i>

113
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:15,884
<i>So hear me then, mister,
and pour me one more...</i>

114
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:17,622
Gentlemen...

115
00:06:17,688 --> 00:06:22,030
<i>If I can't drink it up,
then throw me out the door</i>

116
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:27,742
You have to seize life
and relish every minute.

117
00:06:27,808 --> 00:06:29,612
Eliminate all sorrow.

118
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:32,183
Open a bloody window.

119
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,054
<i>Hallelujah</i>

120
00:06:34,121 --> 00:06:36,158
Okay, okay,
that's enough of that.

121
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,137
<i>Hallelujah</i>

122
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:45,811
<i>Ha...</i>

123
00:06:45,878 --> 00:06:48,416
Hey, Lily, you like suspenders?
'Cause I got them.

124
00:06:48,482 --> 00:06:51,523
Well, I hope you don't mind
if I give them a wee snap.

125
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:54,227
Intimacy.

126
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:58,135
Lily, you've transformed this
dump into a joint. Bless you.

127
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,730
Who are you?

128
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:14,167
- Homer Simpson.
- You know, Homer,

129
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:17,675
I've never met a man who didn't
offer me his chair or his beer.

130
00:07:17,742 --> 00:07:19,812
- You have now.
- So, tell me,

131
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,382
what's wrong with you?

132
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:22,785
It's personal.

133
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:25,791
Tell me. Maybe I can
lighten your load.

134
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:28,663
- My family left me for three weeks.
- No.

135
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,901
The dog and cat
are with Flanders.

136
00:07:32,237 --> 00:07:34,842
I'm alone.
I don't know what to do.

137
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:39,050
You have to have a good time
for their sake,

138
00:07:39,117 --> 00:07:41,388
because if you don't,
they'll feel guilty

139
00:07:41,455 --> 00:07:42,558
and never forgive you.

140
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,227
And you'll never forgive them,

141
00:07:44,294 --> 00:07:46,566
because they're causing you
the misery.

142
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,469
And you'll all be buried
in dirty laundry

143
00:07:48,537 --> 00:07:51,275
with squealing kids
for the rest of your days.

144
00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:56,719
You're the smartest woman
I've ever met in my life.

145
00:07:56,786 --> 00:07:58,255
Except one.

146
00:07:59,224 --> 00:08:00,761
Shut the window!

147
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:02,397
But then everything
smells like you.

148
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:05,002
Take that.

149
00:08:10,714 --> 00:08:15,791
<i>Anticipation</i>

150
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:21,836
<i>Anticipation
is making me late...</i>

151
00:08:21,903 --> 00:08:23,840
Welcome to our tour
of the Vineyard.

152
00:08:23,907 --> 00:08:27,581
This is where Steven Spielberg
shot Jaws.

153
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:29,251
That's the end of our tour.

154
00:08:29,317 --> 00:08:31,689
Now, my aunt's house
is only eight miles away.

155
00:08:31,756 --> 00:08:34,996
But we just have
to make it before sundown.

156
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:42,477
Mom, I think
you've gone off the road.

157
00:08:42,545 --> 00:08:44,481
Watch out for that deer!

158
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,723
- That was close.
- More deer!

159
00:08:52,463 --> 00:08:54,034
We're here.

160
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:57,908
Your turn, Lily.

161
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:06,224
I miss them. I miss them.

162
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,999
It's been so long.
No one to comfort me.

163
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:14,709
Put your mobile away, because
I'm gonna sing in German.

164
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:17,748
<i>Vor der Kaserne</i>

165
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:20,152
<i>Vor dem grossen Tor</i>

166
00:09:20,219 --> 00:09:22,758
<i>Stand eine Laterne</i>

167
00:09:22,825 --> 00:09:25,196
<i>Und steht sie noch davor...</i>

168
00:09:25,262 --> 00:09:27,901
This is like that beautiful
scene in Sound of Music

169
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:30,807
when all the Nazis
sang good night.

170
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:35,684
<i>Wie einst Lili Marleen</i>

171
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:37,655
<i>Wie einst</i>

172
00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:40,761
<i>Lili Marleen</i>

173
00:09:42,363 --> 00:09:45,169
If you're done singing,
can we turn up the game?

174
00:09:50,781 --> 00:09:52,718
What's wrong, lady?

175
00:09:52,785 --> 00:09:54,789
We miss you inside.

176
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:56,559
A good bloke
who never had a break,

177
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:57,828
and now has a broken spirit.

178
00:09:57,895 --> 00:09:59,832
He's lost and lonely,

179
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,838
and really doesn't
give a fig about me.

180
00:10:02,905 --> 00:10:06,144
- I'm in love.
- I love him too.

181
00:10:12,891 --> 00:10:14,194
Okay. The sun is shining.

182
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,467
I can finally read my book.

183
00:10:19,337 --> 00:10:23,045
Hello, nature.
Time to meet your death.

184
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:28,623
Bart, those are tick bites!

185
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,159
You'll get Lyme disease.

186
00:10:30,226 --> 00:10:32,163
Why didn't somebody warn me?

187
00:10:39,712 --> 00:10:41,047
Get me a priest.

188
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:43,787
Mom, I always liked you.

189
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:45,524
Oh, honey, try to relax.

190
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,926
Watch Itchy & Scratchy!

191
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:49,330
I am itchy and scratchy.

192
00:10:49,397 --> 00:10:51,502
Meanwhile,
Homer little dreamed that...

193
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:54,073
Willie! Do you think it would
kill you to rake and talk?

194
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,211
Would you rather
I tell the story

195
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:58,817
about what's under
these leaves and dirt?

196
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:02,891
Oh. No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Carry on.

197
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,899
Getting back,
Lily continued to light up

198
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:10,206
all the men's lives,
except Homer's.

199
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:12,243
Lily!

200
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,145
Gentlemen.

201
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:14,915
I made you all picnic lunches.

202
00:11:14,982 --> 00:11:15,982
Yeah!

203
00:11:16,017 --> 00:11:16,953
It's British food.

204
00:11:17,988 --> 00:11:20,092
Post‐1990 British food.

205
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,428
Yes!

206
00:11:26,672 --> 00:11:29,578
Smithers,
that woman has captivated me,

207
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:30,947
which, if memory serves,

208
00:11:31,014 --> 00:11:33,051
is an early state
of physical arousal.

209
00:11:33,118 --> 00:11:34,655
Sir, we've been
through this before

210
00:11:34,722 --> 00:11:37,594
with several women
and one very shapely tree.

211
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:39,097
I feel a tingle I haven't felt

212
00:11:39,163 --> 00:11:40,877
since they took the cocaine
out of Coca‐Cola.

213
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,671
I must woo her.

214
00:11:42,738 --> 00:11:44,508
And Simpson's my way in.

215
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:46,512
Have him ask her
on a date on my boat

216
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:48,683
which will actually be
a date with me.

217
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,722
But, sir, why not have me
ask her directly?

218
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:53,358
As if I could trust you

219
00:11:53,425 --> 00:11:54,929
to keep your hands off a lady.

220
00:11:54,995 --> 00:11:57,868
How well you know me, sir.

221
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:07,186
Very good, Maggie!

222
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:09,992
Now we can cook them.

223
00:12:16,906 --> 00:12:18,408
Who are all those people?

224
00:12:18,475 --> 00:12:20,847
It's the weekenders
from Falmouth.

225
00:12:22,183 --> 00:12:23,586
It's almost here.

226
00:12:23,653 --> 00:12:26,559
And raise the prices...

227
00:12:33,973 --> 00:12:35,577
Now!

228
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:43,258
Clam strips and beer!

229
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:45,295
Black Dog mousepads!

230
00:12:45,362 --> 00:12:46,675
- Over here!
- T‐shirts!

231
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,070
CDs by James Taylor's brother!

232
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,188
That's it! We're going home.

233
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:04,635
Everyone was innocently falling
into Burns's trap.

234
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:09,545
And trouble brewed as
Lily offered a perverse prayer.

235
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:14,788
Forgive me, Lord.

236
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:16,124
I must have Homer.

237
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:18,195
Please let me win him,
even briefly.

238
00:13:18,261 --> 00:13:20,900
It would be like having
a lover and a child

239
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,604
at the same time.

240
00:13:24,842 --> 00:13:26,244
Hey, Lily. How you doin'?

241
00:13:26,311 --> 00:13:28,783
Homer! I'm so glad
you asked me to meet you here.

242
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,452
Thanks, I'm glad
you feel that way.

243
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,223
But there's something
I didn't tell you.

244
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:34,661
You're on a date
with my boss.

245
00:13:34,728 --> 00:13:35,830
That's my boat.

246
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:40,305
My name is Montgomery Burns.

247
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:43,946
I'm the richest and therefore
most attractive man in town.

248
00:13:44,013 --> 00:13:45,115
Okay, see ya.

249
00:13:45,182 --> 00:13:46,619
Wait, wait, wait, Mr. Burns!

250
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:49,190
Surely a venerable gentleman
such as yourself

251
00:13:49,257 --> 00:13:51,261
would know that
I need a chaperone.

252
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:53,465
Of course.
Simpson, join us.

253
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:56,070
Smithers, cue my weapon of woo.

254
00:14:01,849 --> 00:14:04,086
I know a shortcut.

255
00:14:09,363 --> 00:14:11,835
Why am I staring at her?

256
00:14:11,902 --> 00:14:13,973
I'll make my eyes
look at something else.

257
00:14:19,283 --> 00:14:21,221
Oh, my God.

258
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:23,225
I'm smiling back.

259
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:29,003
I hope you enjoyed
your dinner.

260
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,508
And just wait till we get
to dessert.

261
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:33,144
You make me feel like
I'm having dinner

262
00:14:33,211 --> 00:14:34,848
with a James Bond villain.

263
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,253
She gets me.

264
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:39,423
Now, wink for me, Smithers.

265
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,241
What am I doing here?

266
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,788
What have I done
to this wonderful woman?

267
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:57,159
How can I make it up to her?

268
00:14:58,696 --> 00:14:59,931
I'm sorry.

269
00:14:59,998 --> 00:15:01,301
Why did you bring me here?

270
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,637
Fear of unemployment.

271
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:05,543
Let's just stay
through dessert.

272
00:15:07,313 --> 00:15:09,250
Look at me!
I'm Gypsy Rose Lee!

273
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:12,156
You and me and
my cardiologist make three!

274
00:15:12,222 --> 00:15:14,427
Sorry, I have to leave
right now.

275
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:15,630
But why?

276
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:18,602
I just spilled
a glass of wine on myself.

277
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:20,172
Also, this bottle.

278
00:15:20,238 --> 00:15:22,309
Homer, let's go.

279
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:26,585
That was awful.

280
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:28,288
There's some people
that make you feel

281
00:15:28,355 --> 00:15:30,425
being lonely isn't so bad.

282
00:15:30,492 --> 00:15:32,429
And there are people
that make you

283
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:34,033
never want to be lonely again.

284
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,037
I hear ya.

285
00:15:36,104 --> 00:15:37,406
And I almost understand ya.

286
00:15:37,473 --> 00:15:39,043
Thank God
you were there to save me.

287
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,479
That's what I'm best at.

288
00:15:40,546 --> 00:15:42,617
Saving people from things
I get them into.

289
00:15:42,684 --> 00:15:44,453
You've got a little cake

290
00:15:44,521 --> 00:15:45,923
on the corner of your mouth.

291
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,092
Oh, I do? Where?

292
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:48,461
- Just here.
- There?

293
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:49,865
- Just there.
- Where?

294
00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:51,802
- Right there?
- Just... You're missing it.

295
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,304
- There?
- Just to the...

296
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:55,375
- Oh, just let me do it.
- Okay.

297
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:58,248
You can stop now.

298
00:15:58,314 --> 00:16:01,053
I meant go slow.

299
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,524
Wait a minute, wait.

300
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,661
While you're there,
could you get the upper lip?

301
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,336
Oh, my God,

302
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:10,907
what am I going to do with you?

303
00:16:10,973 --> 00:16:11,909
Please, nothing.

304
00:16:11,975 --> 00:16:14,013
I'm taking you home now.

305
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:32,550
Well, aren't you going
to walk me in?

306
00:16:34,186 --> 00:16:35,823
Look, Lily.

307
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,392
You're the most...

308
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:38,662
Finish that thought.

309
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:40,169
You're the most anything
of any woman

310
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:41,635
I've ever known
except for my wife.

311
00:16:41,702 --> 00:16:43,839
Who I loved, I mean love!
I said love!

312
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:44,841
Oh, that's beautiful.

313
00:16:44,908 --> 00:16:46,244
Thank you.

314
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,448
But give me one damn
proper kiss goodbye.

315
00:16:48,516 --> 00:16:49,784
No.

316
00:17:00,071 --> 00:17:01,608
No. No!

317
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:02,710
This is good,

318
00:17:02,777 --> 00:17:04,480
but is it worth
burning in hell forever?

319
00:17:04,548 --> 00:17:06,217
We'll see each other
in our dreams,

320
00:17:06,284 --> 00:17:07,520
whether you like it or not.

321
00:17:07,587 --> 00:17:09,256
You stay out of my dreams!

322
00:17:09,323 --> 00:17:11,127
All my stuff's in there!

323
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:19,112
Gotta stay awake. If I dream
of Lily, it's all over.

324
00:17:21,314 --> 00:17:24,153
Gotta stay awake.
Gotta stay awake.

325
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:25,756
Must not dream.

326
00:17:25,823 --> 00:17:29,564
Gotta stay awake.
Gotta stay awake.

327
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,766
Oh, no.

328
00:17:35,876 --> 00:17:38,281
You've got a little cake
on the corner of your mouth.

329
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,153
- Homer? Homer?
- She's here.

330
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,991
She's here and God help me,

331
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:44,426
- I'm glad.
- Homer.

332
00:17:44,493 --> 00:17:46,263
- Marge!
- Surprise!

333
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,700
We came back early.

334
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,604
Oh, thank God.
Oh, thank God!

335
00:17:49,671 --> 00:17:51,775
I'll never let you go a...

336
00:17:52,677 --> 00:17:54,213
Who's calling you so late?

337
00:17:54,848 --> 00:17:56,317
Telemarketer.

338
00:17:56,384 --> 00:17:57,954
Gotta take it.

339
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:00,291
Those people are so sensitive.

340
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:04,901
- Hello?
- Wrong number!

341
00:18:04,968 --> 00:18:06,404
- Homer?
- Damn it!

342
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,842
I need to see you now, Homer.

343
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:10,211
You know the address.

344
00:18:10,278 --> 00:18:12,416
Lovers Lane,
just off Fidelity Avenue.

345
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:14,386
Listen.
I have to tell you right now

346
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:16,157
I can never see you again.

347
00:18:16,223 --> 00:18:17,894
Can you tell me in person?

348
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,296
Great idea.

349
00:18:19,363 --> 00:18:21,668
Keep me on the line.
I'll guide you here.

350
00:18:22,804 --> 00:18:24,808
You realize
nothing's gonna happen.

351
00:18:24,874 --> 00:18:26,444
Of course.

352
00:18:26,511 --> 00:18:30,151
<i>I promise you chocolate
and kisses</i>

353
00:18:30,218 --> 00:18:34,326
<i>Martinis with lemon drops...</i>

354
00:18:36,363 --> 00:18:38,234
No, feet! No!

355
00:18:41,273 --> 00:18:42,777
<i>I just woke up</i>

356
00:18:42,844 --> 00:18:47,887
<i>And made you pork chops...</i>

357
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,335
Pork chops!

358
00:19:20,018 --> 00:19:21,922
You're home.

359
00:19:21,988 --> 00:19:22,988
Yes, I am.

360
00:19:23,024 --> 00:19:24,226
And I'll never leave you.

361
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:25,963
There might be frequent
interruptions.

362
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,299
I may stop at Moe's,

363
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:28,936
I may be watching
the hot dogs spin

364
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,338
at the movie theater,

365
00:19:30,405 --> 00:19:33,745
or I may be picking
a flower for you...

366
00:19:33,812 --> 00:19:36,852
but I will never,
ever leave you.

367
00:19:36,918 --> 00:19:38,922
Homie.

368
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:50,880
Now boarding, non‐stop
Springfield to London.

369
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:52,449
Sorry, lady.

370
00:19:58,361 --> 00:19:59,396
How was America, dear?

371
00:19:59,463 --> 00:20:00,966
There's nothing there for me.

372
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,404
It's big, full of fried food,
and heartbreaking...

373
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:05,609
and that's just one man.

374
00:20:05,676 --> 00:20:08,281
There'll never be another
like him.

375
00:20:11,788 --> 00:20:13,324
Buy you a drink, sweetheart?

376
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:14,493
No.

377
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,829
Fancy a drink?

378
00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:16,631
No, thank you.

379
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:18,434
Would you get... No.

380
00:20:18,502 --> 00:20:19,804
No. No thanks.

381
00:20:19,871 --> 00:20:20,871
Get off.

382
00:20:20,906 --> 00:20:22,777
Buy you a corndog?

383
00:20:22,843 --> 00:20:25,783
Yes!
But first, are you married?

384
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,987
And would you shave off
the mustache?

385
00:20:28,054 --> 00:20:30,592
Yes, and immediately.
