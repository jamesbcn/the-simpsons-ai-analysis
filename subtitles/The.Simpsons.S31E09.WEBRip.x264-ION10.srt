1
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:12,179
<i>Okily-dokily, okily-dokily</i>

2
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:14,181
<i>Come meet Ned Flanders</i>

3
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:16,583
<i>And his two boys
Rod and Todd</i>

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,586
<i>He's friends with God
and has a ripped bod</i>

5
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,089
<i>Diddly</i>

6
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,625
<i>Doodily, diddly</i>

7
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,294
<i>Doodily</i>

8
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:32,599
<i>Diddly</i>

9
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:36,503
<i>Doodily</i>

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,072
<i>Diddly, doodily, diddly...</i>

11
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,174
No couch, boys.
I gave it to the poor.

12
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,078
<i>A-diddly-doodily</i>

13
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,014
<i>Diddly-doodily</i>

14
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:51,051
Neddy? Neddy.

15
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:53,120
Oh, Maude, you've come back.

16
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,789
Completely clothed
and untouchable.

17
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:58,058
This is the sexiest dream
I've ever had.

18
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,126
Wait, Maudie.

19
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:00,727
Just one little kiss.

20
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,234
All tongue, no lips.

21
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:08,769
Just like Maude.

22
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:11,772
Daddy, why are you crying?

23
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,907
Oh, just watering
the old lip lawn.

24
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:15,509
I had a dream about your mom.

25
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,010
Don't you ever dream about her?

26
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,485
Faster, Mommy, faster.

27
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:34,061
What's wrong, Todd?

28
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:37,130
I can never unsee that.

29
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,569
It's okay, son.
Just a bad dream.

30
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,071
Want some lukewarm water?

31
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:47,975
Daddy, I can't remember
what Mommy looks like.

32
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,143
I think I might have
a video or two of your mother.

33
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,411
What's wrong?

34
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:57,417
I'm doing
Mommy's old skin routine.

35
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,753
Now, that's the healthy way
to grieve.

36
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:09,963
I'm scared.

37
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,033
Well, I have faith in you.

38
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,369
Who are you people,

39
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,237
and what have you done
with my family?

40
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,872
Answer me!

41
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:22,009
Oh, Dad, every time we make you
shovel the driveway,

42
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,144
you wind up someplace crazy.

43
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,879
Won't you join us for dinner?

44
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,514
He sure will.

45
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:29,583
I'll pick him up tomorrow.

46
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,687
Mommy was so nice.

47
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,856
And she still is,
Roddily Doddily.

48
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,392
How do you know?
Have you heard from her?

49
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,360
Oh, no, sir.

50
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:43,130
But faith is believing
in something without proof.

51
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,632
You can't see my lip
below my mustache,

52
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,035
- but you know it's there.
- Can I see it?

53
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,369
No.

54
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,238
My math teacher said

55
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,141
believing in something
without proof is crazy.

56
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,576
You think the coat
of many colors was crazy?

57
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,812
Noah's ark and the Holy Ghost,
crazy?

58
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,582
Don't tell me you're doubting
Balaam's talking ass.

59
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:08,021
Mommy, if you still remember me,
give me a sign.

60
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,623
This is Homer Simpson
auditioning

61
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,192
for the air guitar championship
of the world.

62
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,428
I'm taking you down,
Bjorn Turoque.

63
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,403
<i>Praise God from whom</i>

64
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,374
<i>All blessings flow</i>

65
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,376
<i>Praise God</i>

66
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:34,314
<i>It's almost time to go</i>

67
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,983
<i>This boring sermon</i>

68
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,188
<i>Must end soon</i>

69
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,824
<i>Arena football's</i>

70
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,461
<i>On at noon</i>

71
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:55,102
And for that simple reason,
we are right

72
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,672
and Episcopalians
are wrong, wrong, wrong.

73
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,107
Now I'd like to invite

74
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,409
our littlest parishioners
to the front.

75
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:05,245
Gertie, a little
traveling music, please?

76
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:13,120
Soon as we can, we're
replacing her with Spotify.

77
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,189
I'm taking middle C.

78
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,825
So, tell me, young Christians,

79
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,994
if you could speak
to Baby Jesus,

80
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,329
what would you say?

81
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,331
I'd say thank you
for being born,

82
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,333
'cause that gave us Christmas.

83
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,269
I'm killing it.

84
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,171
Ralph, what would you say?

85
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:32,939
I'd say, Baby Jesus,

86
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,942
thank you for dying
for our shins.

87
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,214
And you, Todd?
What would you say?

88
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:49,856
I lost my voice from crying.

89
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,525
Oh, come on, young man.

90
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,260
You're my closer.

91
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,865
What would you say to Jesus?

92
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,634
I'd say...

93
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,302
thanks for nothing!

94
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,805
My mommy's dead
and she's never coming back,

95
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,973
and I don't believe
in God anymore.

96
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,713
No. No!

97
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,052
Thank God these
collection baskets were empty.

98
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,453
You're welcome.

99
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,195
<i>A mighty problem is our Todd</i>

100
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,864
<i>His faith in God</i>

101
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:34,401
<i>Is failing</i>

102
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:40,173
<i>Homer accidentally killed
his mom</i>

103
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,112
<i>He knocked her
off a railing</i>

104
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,887
Now, son,
let me put this gently.

105
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,722
We're all going to hell!

106
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,059
You opened a doorway
to disbelief in God's own house!

107
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,394
Why does God need
so many houses?

108
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,063
Couldn't some go to poor people?

109
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,232
You just stop right there, boy.

110
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,566
You do not question

111
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,269
God's real estate holdings
and tax-free status.

112
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:12,272
I have to let off
a little steam.

113
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:15,575
Shucks! Shucks! Shucks!

114
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,015
That's it. Young man,
I am FaceTiming the reverend.

115
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,818
Reverend,

116
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,887
I know you hate it
when I bother you.

117
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,158
It's okay. It's okay.

118
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,628
I'm at my daughter's
ballet recital.

119
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:35,629
Oh, is she good?

120
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,398
Seriously, are any of them good?

121
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,467
Reverend, like the pharaoh's
army in the Red Sea,

122
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,635
I'm in over my head.

123
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,703
My heathen son
needs you right now.

124
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:47,974
Oh, sorry, got to go.

125
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,643
I have to read the last rites...

126
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,678
for the art of ballet.

127
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,214
Lord, please punish
my boy thoroughly

128
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:57,717
so he may once again believe
in thine divine mercy.

129
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:01,254
- Daddy, I have a problem.
- Oh, you too?

130
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:04,958
I accidentally watched
a 30 Rock by mistake.

131
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,127
Oh, my good, good boy.

132
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,429
So it's okay to watch?

133
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:12,499
Just Kenneth. Just Kenneth.

134
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:18,505
Good morning, Rod. Todd. God.

135
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,940
- Good morning.
- Morning.

136
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,642
Let us stiffly resume
our nice, regular routine.

137
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,811
Dear Lord, we thank you
for this breakfast,

138
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:28,448
each generic brand Circle-O
a symbol of God's unending love.

139
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,016
- Amen.
- Amen.

140
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,851
Todd?

141
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,555
Son? Can I just get an amen?

142
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:37,958
A prayer without an amen

143
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,526
is like a Tootsie Pop
without a center.

144
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,861
Oh, I apologize for thinking
the word tootsie.

145
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,296
But there must be a way

146
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,165
to scare religion back
into my son.

147
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,034
Isn't there some hell on earth
I could briefly place him in?

148
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,636
Let me in, boy!

149
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:52,205
The school bus
will be here any minute!

150
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,342
To find your clothes,
just solve this series of clues.

151
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,711
What has bark but no bite?

152
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,145
The dog?

153
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,815
Wrong. A tree.

154
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,516
Here's another.
If a plane crashes

155
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,518
on the border
of North and South Dakota,

156
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,620
where do you bury the survivors?

157
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:08,788
Minnesota.

158
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,357
Wrong.

159
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:13,126
You don't bury the survivors.
They're survivors!

160
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,128
I don't understand,
but I'll bury you.

161
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,997
Tell you what.
I'll give you your pants back

162
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,833
if you can answer
this last one.

163
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,035
- What has two hairs on top...
- Right.

164
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,504
- Is somebody's dad...
- Somebody's dad, yes.

165
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:27,307
And starting right now
he's getting quite mad?

166
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:30,310
I don't know,
but just give me my pants, boy!

167
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,281
Can we take pictures?

168
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,517
Wait, you see that too?

169
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,688
That Simpson house

170
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,957
will put the fear of God
in him.

171
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,625
Give me your pants.

172
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,962
Todd Flanders, I cast thee out.

173
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,431
<i>His little mind</i>

174
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:54,367
<i>Is filled with doubt</i>

175
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:59,139
<i>So now we have
to cast him out</i>

176
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:04,010
<i>You'll learn
the Lord is sweet</i>

177
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:09,649
<i>On his journey of 40 feet</i>

178
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:19,259
Daddy, do you love me more now?

179
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,627
Just by asking,

180
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,695
you have committed the sin
of pride.

181
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:25,799
Yes, Ned, yes.

182
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,534
We'll keep him here
till tomorrow.

183
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,070
Yes, I'll read him
a good bedtime story.

184
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,038
Right, right. No wizards.

185
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,541
No pagans. No wild things.

186
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,876
How about
The Very Hungry Caterpillar?

187
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,545
No, that celebrates gluttony.

188
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,280
Clifford the Big Red Dog?

189
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,649
Clifford
the satanic abomination.

190
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:43,783
Everyone Poops?

191
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,752
Not me.

192
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,654
Todd. Psst! Todd.

193
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,323
I know what it's like to leave
the faith of your family.

194
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,991
Thank you so much, Lisa.

195
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,593
At last, someone gets it.

196
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,497
But have I got a god for you.

197
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,833
Consider the Buddha.
He brings peace from within.

198
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,768
He avoids the pitfalls of ego,

199
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,837
he loves yoga and Yoda,

200
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,839
and he's lost weight.

201
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,507
What happens when you die?

202
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:11,144
You get reincarnated as a human
or an animal or a ghost.

203
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:15,014
Pass. Buddha's no god,
and neither is God.

204
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,016
Don't worry, I'll get him.

205
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,687
By the way, what did you
reincarnate David Bowie as?

206
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,856
Help me, love. It's Bowie.

207
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:26,259
I've been meditating too much.

208
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,027
Where's Todd?

209
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,529
It was horrible.

210
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,531
I woke up,
and he'd cleaned my room.

211
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,366
What kind of psycho does that?

212
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,834
Hi, Grampa Simpson.

213
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,171
You're talking to me directly?

214
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:40,707
Even my Alexa won't do that.

215
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,375
Being with him

216
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:46,246
has made me so tired.

217
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,647
Hey, Marge,

218
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,082
you may have noticed

219
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,284
I took a shower
earlier this week.

220
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,220
I can't. I can't.

221
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,055
Not with Todd in the house.

222
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,625
Oh, we've had kids in the house
for ten years.

223
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:01,361
Not that one.
He's used to silence.

224
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,563
- He'll hear us.
- No, he won't.

225
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,231
Yes, I will!

226
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,901
Got to get rid of that kid.

227
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:09,903
Can it be?

228
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,337
Oh, my goodness!

229
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,173
The face of our Lord and Savior

230
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,874
in a humble piece of toast?

231
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,343
Clearly,
no human could have made this.

232
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,213
And the Lord said,

233
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,049
take this and eat,
for I am the toast of the town.

234
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,218
- You drew that on.
- No, no.

235
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,787
God drew it on.
Look, he signed it.

236
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,722
Jebus. See?

237
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,592
Why would God make toast
that looked like Jesus?

238
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,260
'Cause parents are always
showing off pictures

239
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:37,063
of their kids?

240
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,065
So much innocent bread died

241
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,500
for my sins.

242
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,604
So innocent.

243
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,573
<i>What is good</i>

244
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,508
<i>And what is sin</i>

245
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:54,480
<i>Bart wants
to get rid of him</i>

246
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,815
Yo, this is Todd.

247
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,451
I have to share my room
until he believes in God again.

248
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:01,154
You don't believe in God?
Well, that's crazy.

249
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,923
Who else but an all-loving,
omnipotent being

250
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,826
could create beautiful wedgies
and purple nurples?

251
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,328
Not so fast.

252
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,463
What if I'm the only being
in the universe,

253
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,298
and you're all
my mental projections?

254
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,067
Project this!

255
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:17,070
I must have wanted this
to happen!

256
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,305
So now that you see
how bad kids turn out,

257
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:20,673
you want to go home, right?

258
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,909
Stop using us as examples!

259
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:25,211
I believe your friends
are all going to hell.

260
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:27,180
- Yeah!
- Cool!

261
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:34,787
I hear you!

262
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,723
What doesn't
that little twerp hear?

263
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,559
I don't know, but I heard that.

264
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,962
Okay. He can't hear us now.

265
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,564
Yes, I can.

266
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,066
You're unbuttoning your shirt,
Mr. Simpson.

267
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,970
What does that paper say?

268
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,508
Hi, Todd.

269
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:56,909
Still seeking enlightenment?

270
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,711
I told you, not now.

271
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,647
Maybe I'll reconsider
your stupid beliefs

272
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,548
when I come back as a worm.

273
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,151
In Buddhism,
that's halfway to yes!

274
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,320
Look, Todd,
you don't have to believe.

275
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:10,690
In church, just smile and nod,
but be sleeping on the inside.

276
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,392
That works at work too.

277
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,227
But I really don't believe.

278
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,530
I'm sad because my mommy's gone
and never coming back.

279
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,232
You know how that feels?

280
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,667
Oh, do I.

281
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,702
Oh, no, don't relive it. Don't!

282
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,138
You don't come home for dinner

283
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,539
till 10:00 at night.

284
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,308
You never cook anything
worth eating.

285
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,209
Well, who wants
to cook for a failure?

286
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,412
Good God, woman,
why did you marry me?

287
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,947
To piss off my mother,
and it worked!

288
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:38,117
Tell the kid I love him,
but I'm as bad at goodbyes

289
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,754
as I am at picking husbands.

290
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,791
My mom is gone.

291
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,060
And so is my ice cream.

292
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:50,163
And so is my hair!

293
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,001
Moe, I got to get drunk.
And fast.

294
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,772
I'll take one too.

295
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,341
What the...?!

296
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,476
I'm losing everything.
Just give me a drink!

297
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,678
I'm sorry, Flanders.
I can't pour you a drink.

298
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:08,581
You're too good. It's just,
it's not something I can do.

299
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,850
Please. I'm begging you.

300
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,919
Yeah, that's $24.

301
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:17,790
<i>Ned Flanders
is drinking today</i>

302
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,627
<i>Allelujah</i>

303
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:26,933
<i>His son Todd
has gone astray</i>

304
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:31,904
<i>Allelujah</i>

305
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:35,308
<i>Raise your mug
and drink it down</i>

306
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:40,346
<i>Allelujah</i>

307
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,682
<i>In the worst bar</i>

308
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:45,184
<i>In this town</i>

309
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:50,089
<i>Allelujah</i>

310
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,025
You know,
Homer, I always thought

311
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,794
you proved the existence of God.

312
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,630
I mean, you fall off cliffs,
and you're fit as a fiddle.

313
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,132
Well, ain't that a diddle!

314
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,435
Diddly, diddly.

315
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,103
- Diddle, diddle, diddle, diddle.
- Diddly, diddly.

316
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,976
So this is what it's like

317
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,744
to look down on someone.

318
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,914
You know what, Ned?
There may...

319
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,482
There may not be a heaven,

320
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,918
but getting drunk with you
ain't hell.

321
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,322
Oh, you're great.

322
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,325
This is the beginning
of a beautiful...

323
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,762
You killed them!

324
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,664
This is the worst
Uber ride ever!

325
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,332
You're getting four stars.

326
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:38,237
No...!

327
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,192
Welcome to Heaven.

328
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:02,195
Oh, Lord. It's just as beautiful
as I pictured it.

329
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,330
This is your version, Ned.

330
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,399
Homer gets his too.

331
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:11,471
So, not like I'm feeling
I put in way too much work,

332
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,372
but Homer got in too?

333
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,209
Well, a couple of years ago,
sloth became a virtue.

334
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,211
I don't really understand it.

335
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,079
You'd have to talk to my kid.

336
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,181
He's 33 and still lives at home.

337
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,584
I've been through
some stuff, man.

338
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,986
Abe Lincoln!

339
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,421
Did you know the picture

340
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,657
about my life is
Spielberg's biggest movie?

341
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:35,194
No! What about Jaws and E.T.
and all the Jurassic...?

342
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,396
Well, how did I do
in the awards?

343
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,899
- You were beaten by Argo.
- Argo?!

344
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:43,703
That was the worst experience
I ever had in a theater.

345
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,872
You have other people to see.

346
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,207
- Wear these passes.
- Visitors?

347
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:49,775
Hmm, that's odd.

348
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,044
It must mean that
your bodies aren't dead yet.

349
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,080
<i>We need you now</i>

350
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:58,284
<i>O God on high</i>

351
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:04,824
<i>So stupid Flanders
and Homer don't die</i>

352
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,927
Ned Flanders, I swear to you
I will use every ounce of skill

353
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:10,096
in my body
to bring you back to life.

354
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,265
What about Homer?

355
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,666
Mm, que será, será.

356
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:27,613
Oh, my.
They're holding a vigil.

357
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,483
Look how many, many lives
Dad touched.

358
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,118
That's Flanders' vigil.

359
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,653
Dad's is over there.

360
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,056
Vigils are a surprisingly
large part of this job.

361
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,659
Oh, yeah! So sad!

362
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,795
Dad's an acquired taste, Lis,
like Hawaiian pizza.

363
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:46,165
Dad never judged a pizza
by where it came from.

364
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:49,101
He just ate it.

365
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,970
God, this is just you and me,

366
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,638
so I'm gonna tell you a secret.

367
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:55,341
I love my dad,
so please don't take him.

368
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,644
Bart, what are you praying for?

369
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,379
New bike.

370
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,317
Are you sure you don't want
to pray for your dad?

371
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,818
I can't pray.

372
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:08,120
I don't think
anyone's listening anymore.

373
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,990
Oh, sweetie, prayer doesn't
have to be to God.

374
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:13,459
It can also just be
an honest conversation

375
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,428
we have with ourselves.

376
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,897
Just do what your heart
tells you.

377
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:21,567
Oh, I'm not really sure
what's happening,

378
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:24,770
but I'm really sad,
and I need help.

379
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:29,141
<i>Rejoice, rejoice</i>

380
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:33,145
<i>O Springfield town</i>

381
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,148
<i>'Cause what goes up</i>

382
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:40,620
<i>Must come down</i>

383
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,160
I'm winning every bet!

384
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,563
And there's no stupid
Fox halftime show.

385
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,565
Could Heaven be any better?

386
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,703
I agree. This is everything
I could possibly dream of.

387
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,142
Todd is praying.
He's praying for me.

388
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,311
And it's working!

389
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,179
I'm returning to my family!

390
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,681
Bye, Homer.

391
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,185
- Homer?
- Mom?

392
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:17,790
I never got a chance
to say goodbye, but now I can.

393
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:19,692
Remember, I'm not a hugger.

394
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,127
Oh, right. Sorry.

395
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,529
You never need
to apologize to me.

396
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:26,365
In my eyes, you're perfect.

397
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,200
Ah, we're in Heaven.

398
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,036
Come here, you.

399
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:34,674
Oh, my God,
this is all I ever wanted!

400
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,908
Aw, damn it!

401
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,579
Hallelujah! I'm alive and back
in this big beautiful world.

402
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,115
I could kiss
the first thing I see.

403
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,284
Promise is a promise.

404
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,686
- Homie!
- Dad!

405
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,454
Doughboy!

406
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,624
Daddy, you came back!
I believe again!

407
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,959
Two lives saved by prayer.

408
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,461
And modern medicine.

409
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,263
This is why I became a doctor.

410
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,231
Because you both owe me $12,000.

411
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:04,806
No, no, no, no.

412
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:08,641
Nirvana is for closers,
and you couldn't close the deal.

413
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,609
- But-but...
- But-but-but-but-but nothing!

414
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,279
You couldn't even close
Todd frickin' Flanders!

415
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,181
That kid would follow
a butterfly.

416
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,116
Just give me one more chance.

417
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:20,820
Do you think I got
to be Buddha by being patient?!

418
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,856
Check this out.
I got you Ralph Wiggum.

419
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:27,193
Ralph Wiggum? What am I gonna do
with Ralph Wiggum?

420
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,495
Everything is nothing!

421
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,998
Kid, you just blew my mind.

422
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,375
Good night, Roddy.

423
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:55,421
<i>Praise God from whom
all blessings flow</i>

424
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,889
<i>Praise God</i>

425
00:20:56,956 --> 00:21:02,294
<i>It's almost time to go</i>

426
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:08,601
<i>Todd has found
just what he seeks</i>

427
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:15,074
<i>New episode in two weeks</i>
