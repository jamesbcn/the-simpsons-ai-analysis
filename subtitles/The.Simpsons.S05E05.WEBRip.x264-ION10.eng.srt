00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,346
{\an8}(ghostly shriek)

00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,438
(evil laughter)

(all moaning)

00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,915
Paintings:

8
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,499
Lifeless images rendered
in colorful goop.

9
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:48,336
But at night, they take on
a life of their own.

10
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,053
They become portals to hell...

11
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,093
so scary and horrible
and gruesome that--

12
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:55,217
Bart, you should warn people
this episode is very frightening.

13
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,885
Maybe they'd rather listen to that old

14
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,983
"War of the Worlds" broadcast
on N.P.R., hmm?

15
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,269
-Yes, Mother.
-Good.

16
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,772
Now, you hold Maggie. I'm going to
buy some earrings at the gift shop.

17
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:09,436
(sighs) The subject of our first painting
tonight is the most...

18
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:13,277
foul, evil, vicious,
diabolical beast to stalk the earth.

19
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,414
Of course,
I refer to--

20
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,202
(muffled)

21
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,833
The devil.

22
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,338
{\an8}And next in our fall catalog--
we love this--

23
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,342
{\an8}it is a vision
in raspberry cream.

24
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,835
{\an8}(applause)

25
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,598
{\an8}Ohh! Pure genius.

26
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:41,481
{\an8}(gurgling)

27
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:46,399
{\an8}Oh! And now to make the leap
from dreams to reality.

28
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,981
{\an8}-(shrieks)
-Sorry, Homer.

29
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,276
{\an8}While you were daydreaming,
we ate all the doughnuts.

30
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,240
{\an8}Well, there were a few left, but we
chucked 'em at an old man for kicks.

31
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,869
{\an8}Damn buzzards!
I ain't dead yet!

32
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,115
{\an8}All right. Stay calm.
Remember your training.

33
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:08,455
"Dear Homer, I.O.U. one emergency
doughnut. Signed, Homer."

34
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,335
{\an8}Bastard! He's always
one step ahead.

35
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,512
{\an8}Oh! I'd sell my soul
for a doughnut!

36
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,392
{\an8}-(rumbling)
-Well, that can be arranged.

37
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,520
{\an8}Flanders!
You're the devil?

38
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,348
{\an8}(chuckles) It's always
the one you least suspect.

39
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,484
{\an8}Now, many people offer
to sell their souls...

40
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,112
{\an8}without reflecting upon
the grave ramifica--

41
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,729
{\an8}-Do you have a doughnut or not?
-Coming up.

42
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,027
{\an8}Just sign here.
Careful, hot pen.

43
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,870
Hmm. Who's that goat-legged fellow?
I like the cut of his jib.

44
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,160
Uh, Prince of Darkness, sir.
He's your 11:00.

45
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,290
(gasps)
Ah!

46
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,835
Now, remember, the instant
you finish it, I own your soul for--

47
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,466
Hey, wait, if I don't
finish this last bite,

48
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,140
you don't get
my soul, do you?

49
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,299
Uh, technically no, but---

50
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,597
I'm smarter than the devil!
I'm smarter than the dev--

51
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,602
You are not smarter than me!

52
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,355
I'll see you in hell yet,
Homer Simpson!

53
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,438
Not likely.
(chuckles)

54
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,160
(muttering)

55
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,621
Hm. Hm. Hm.

56
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,912
Mmm!

57
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,876
Mmm! Forbidden doughnut.

58
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,955
-Hmm?
-Well, well. Finishing something?

59
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,006
(screams)

60
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,969
(whimpering)

61
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,426
(gasps)

62
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,312
-Homer, did you eat that doughnut?
-No.

63
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:50,024
Your wide behind won't
save you this time. Hey, Bart.

64
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,694
-Hey.
-Wait!

65
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,073
Doesn't my father have
the right to a fair trial?

66
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,950
Oh, you Americans with your
"due process" And "fair trials."

67
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:02,029
This is always so much easier
in Mexico. All right. Very well.

68
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:05,536
We'll have the trial tomorrow
at the stroke of midnight.

69
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,670
Till then, you're going to
spend the day in hell!

70
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,420
(screaming)

71
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,219
(sighs)
That wasn't so bad.

72
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,182
Huh? Ow! Ow! Ow!

73
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,443
So, you like doughnuts, eh?

74
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,443
-Uh-huh.
-Well,

75
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,105
have all the doughnuts
in the world!

76
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,114
(cackling)

77
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,828
More. Mmm!

78
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:56,957
I don't understand it.
James Coco went mad in 15 minutes.

79
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,587
(chiming)

80
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,255
(yowls)

81
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:04,854
Ooh!

82
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,099
-Homer, are you all right?
-No.

83
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,811
Mr. Simpson, don't you worry.

84
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,191
I watched <i>Matlock</i> in a bar
last night.

85
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,099
The sound wasn't on,
but I think I got the gist of it.

86
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,488
Hear ye! Hear ye!

87
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:26,202
The Court of Infernal Affairs
is now in session.

88
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,494
Very well. But first,
some ground rules.

89
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,078
Number one:
We get bathroom breaks every half hour.

90
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,294
Agreed. Number two:
The jury will be chosen by me.

91
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,085
Agreed.
No, wait!

92
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,419
Silence! I give you
the jury of the damned!

93
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:44,586
Benedict Arnold.
Lizzie Borden. Richard Nixon.

94
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:48,387
But I'm not dead yet. In fact,
I just wrote an article for <i>Redbook.</i>

95
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,063
-Hey, listen, I did a favor for you.
-Yes, master.

96
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:55,022
John Wilkes booth.
Blackbeard the Pirate. John Dillinger.

97
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:58,694
And the starting line of
the 1976 Philadelphia Flyers.

98
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,395
-(gasps)
-(chattering)

99
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:13,043
I'm sorry, Mr. Blackbeard. We're low
on chairs, and this is the last one.

100
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:16,672
Arr! This chair be high, says I.

101
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:22,631
(clears throat) I hold here a contract
between myself and one Homer Simpson,

102
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,715
pledging me his soul
for a doughnut!

103
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:30,562
Which I delivered!
And it was scrum-didilly-umptious.

104
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,430
I simply ask
for what is mine.

105
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:37,898
-(murmuring)
-That was a right pretty speech, sir.

106
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,770
But I ask you,
what is a contract?

107
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,857
Webster's defines it as

108
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,033
"An agreement under the law
which is unbreakable."

109
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,742
"Which is unbreakable"!

110
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,619
Excuse me.
I must use the restroom.

111
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,334
(door slams)

112
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,917
Uh, Mr. Hutz?

113
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,876
Homer Simpson,
I have no choice...

114
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,717
but to sentence you
to an eternity of--

115
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,763
Wait! Before you send him to hell,
there's something you should see.

116
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,018
That's a photo of Homer
and me at our wedding.

117
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,941
Wait a minute. You got married
in an emergency room?

118
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,771
Well, Homer ate the entire
wedding cake by himself...

119
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,778
before the wedding.

120
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,780
(laughter)

121
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,743
Read the back!
The back!

122
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,453
Arr. 'tis some kind
of treasure map.

123
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,995
-You idiot, you can't read.
-Aye, 'tis true.

124
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,830
My debauchery was
my way of compensatin'.

125
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,786
"Dear Marge, you have
given me your hand in marriage.

126
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:45,208
"All I can give you
in return is my soul,

127
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,678
which I pledge
to you forever."

128
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,338
(murmuring)

129
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,428
We've heard enough.
Your Honor,

130
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,143
we find that Homer Simpson's soul
is legally the property...

131
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,144
of Marge Simpson
and not of the devil.

132
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,976
(groans)

133
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,441
-Yea!
-Whoo-hoo-- Ow!

134
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,614
All right, Simpson.
You get your soul back.

135
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:11,824
But let that ill-gotten doughnut
be forever on your head.

136
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,698
(Homer screams)

137
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,543
(Homer chewing)

138
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,745
-Homer, stop picking at it.
-Oh!

139
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,377
But I'm so sweet and tasty.

140
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,375
(sighs)
Well, time to go to work.

141
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,637
Dad, I wouldn't
go outside if I were you.

142
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,559
{\an8}Don't worry, boys. He's gotta
come out of there sometime.

143
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:41,398
The next exhibit in our
ghoulish gallery is entitled--

144
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,559
the "School Bus"?

145
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:47,358
Oh! Oh! They must
mean the "Ghoul Bus."

146
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,203
{\an8}Nope. It says right there,
"School bus."

147
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,659
{\an8}Well, there's nothing scarier
than having to go to school.

148
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,446
(sighs)

149
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:10,131
Hey, Bart, look!
Krusty trading cards!

150
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,466
The long-awaited
eighth series!

151
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,813
{\an8}BART: "Krusty visits relatives
in Annapolis, Maryland."

152
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,808
{\an8}"Krusty poses for trading
card photo."

153
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:23,191
Hmm. He seems to be running
a little low on ideas.

154
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:27,401
-Well, at least you got the gum.
-Oww! I cut my cheek!

155
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,820
Whoa! Whoa!

156
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,624
-(screaming)
-(horn blaring)

157
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,949
(screaming)

158
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,117
Oh--
I hope this is sweat.

159
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,793
Bart, what's wrong?

160
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:46,592
I just had a vision of
my own horrible, fiery death.

161
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,669
And?

162
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,093
Lisa, your brother's
obviously had a nightmare.

163
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,172
Don't worry, honey.
The scary part's over.

164
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,257
(horn blaring)

165
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,263
Marge, look at all this great stuff
I found at the marina!

166
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,466
It was just sitting
in some guy's boat.

167
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,467
-(horn blaring)
-Aah!

168
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,653
-(gasp)
-Hello, Simpson.

169
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,899
I'm riding the bus because
Mother hid my car keys

170
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,191
to punish me for talking
to a woman on the phone.

171
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,275
She was right to do it.

172
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,319
Excuse me.
Bart's a little upset this morning,

173
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,784
so could everyone please
be extra-nice to him?

174
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,905
(all laughing)

175
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:21,202
Hey, where's
your diaper, baby?

176
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,577
{\an8}Thank goodness he's drawn
attention away from my shirt.

177
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,246
(groaning)

178
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,472
(snarling)

179
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,894
(gasps) Milhouse!
Milhouse, wake up.

180
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,733
-Quick, look out the window.
-No way, Bart.

181
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:48,229
If I lean over, I leave myself open
to wedgies, wet willies,

182
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,194
or even the dreaded
rear admiral.

183
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:53,784
-(grunts)
-Otto, you gotta do something!

184
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,661
There's a gremlin
on the side of the bus!

185
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,409
Hey, <i>no problemo,</i> Bart-dude.
I'll get rid of it.

186
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,997
{\an8}No! Oh, no.
I just made my last payment.

187
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,128
Oh.

188
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,513
(screams)
Everybody!

189
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,595
There's a monster
on the side of the bus!

190
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,601
(yelling)

191
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,193
Hey, there's no monster.

192
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,059
-You're deceptive.
-I don't see anything.

193
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,817
Hey, who's
driving the bus?

194
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,780
Ooh!
<i>Una momento, por favor.</i>

195
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,027
Foolish earthlings.

196
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,914
Frightened of a creature
that does not exist.

197
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,991
(laughing loudly)

198
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,503
(grunting)

199
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,633
-(gasps)
-(groans)

200
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,880
Now, I've gotten word that
a child is using his imagination,

201
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,546
and I've come
to put a stop to it.

202
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,514
No! No, it's true!
There's a monster on the bus.

203
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,394
The only monster on this bus

204
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,811
is a lack of proper respect
for the rules.

205
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,230
Oh!

206
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,311
(groaning)

207
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,193
(screaming)

208
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,608
Ach. Me mule wouldn't
walk in the mud.

209
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,867
So I had to put
17 bullets in him.

210
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,659
(groaning)

211
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,655
You believe me, don't you?
You're my friend who believes me.

212
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,328
Sweet, trustworthy
Milhouse.

213
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,417
Actually, Bart, you're kinda
creepin' me out.

214
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,673
Uh, I think
I'm gonna go sit, uh,

215
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,046
w-with that
foreign exchange student.

216
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:44,814
Oh, <i>guten tag! </i>Would you care for
a bite of my <i>vengelerstrasse</i> bar?

217
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,139
I also have a bag
of marzipan joyjoys!

218
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,607
The gremlin's takin'
off the wheel!

219
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,527
Stop the bus or we're
all gonna die! Aaah!

220
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,497
Take me bridle and lash
his hands to the seat!

221
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,920
Would you like another
lick of my flavor wax?

222
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,881
Uh, sure.

223
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,628
Well, now that
we're friends, <i>Uter,</i>

224
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,875
how 'bout loosening
these straps, huh?

225
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,837
<i>Ja, das ist gut.</i>

226
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,847
(groans)

227
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,779
(screaming)

228
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,275
(all screaming)

229
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,958
-(screaming)
-(gasps)

230
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,498
-(growling)
-(grunting)

231
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,542
-Hey, boy!
-(horn blaring)

232
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,258
Pull, Willie! Pull!

233
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,721
I'm doin' all the pullin',
ya blouse-wearin' poodle walker!

234
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:20,315
Oh, Dear Lord!
It's some sort of hideous monster.

235
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,120
Aw, isn't that cute?
He's trying to claw my eyes out.

236
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,210
Whoa!

237
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,211
Gadzooks!

238
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,803
Look at the bus! I was right,
I tell ya! I was right!

239
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,839
Right or wrong, your behavior
was still disruptive, young man.

240
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,553
Perhaps spending the remainder
of your life in a madhouse...

241
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,974
-will teach you some manners.
-Ha-ha!

242
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,438
(sighs) At least now
I can get some rest.

243
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,399
Hidilly-ho, Bart!

244
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,821
(screams)

245
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:10,623
We come now to the final and most
terrifying painting of the evening.

246
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:14,831
To even gaze upon it
is to go mad.

247
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:19,964
(shrieks) They're dogs,
and they're playing poker!

248
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,304
Aaah!
(crazed laughter)

249
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:30,217
We had a story to go with this painting,
but it was far too intense.

250
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,724
So we just threw something
together with vampires. Enjoy!

251
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:39,063
KENT BROCKMAN (on TV):<i> Another</i>
<i>local peasant has been found dead,</i>

252
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:42,106
<i>drained of his blood, with</i>
<i>two teeth marks on his throat.</i>

253
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:46,951
<i>This black cape was found</i>
<i>on the scene. Police are baffled.</i>

254
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,819
<i>We think we're dealing</i>
<i>with a supernatural being,</i>

255
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,657
<i>most likely a mummy.</i>

256
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,582
<i>As a precaution,</i>
<i>I've ordered</i>

257
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:57,621
<i>the Egyptian wing of the</i>
<i>Springfield Museum destroyed.</i>

258
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,536
<i>Nice work, Ed.</i>

259
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,335
No, no, they're wrong!

260
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,088
The creature they seek
is the walking undead.

261
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,471
Nosferatu.
Das vampyr.

262
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,638
A vampire!

263
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:14,849
(chuckles) Lisa,
vampires are make-believe.

264
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,432
Just like elves,
gremlins and Eskimos.

265
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,098
<i>In a completely unrelated</i>
<i>story,</i>

266
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,646
<i>Montgomery Burns</i>
<i>has just closed a deal...</i>

267
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,559
<i>to buy the Springfield</i>
<i>Blood Bank.</i>

268
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,108
<i>Oh, I'm very excited</i>
<i>about this deal.</i>

269
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:29,573
<i>What? Oh.</i>
<i>Precious blood.</i>

270
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,365
{\an8}Hmm. Business deal.

271
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,947
It sure was nice of
Mr. Burns to invite us...

272
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,656
for a midnight dinner
at his country house in...

273
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,497
Pennsylvania.

274
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,292
(thunderclap)

275
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,587
Ah, there's something fishy
about this whole setup.

276
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,131
Lisa, stop being
so suspicious.

277
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,505
Did everyone wash their necks
like Mr. Burns asked?

278
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,762
-Yes.
-Sure did.

279
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,984
-(doorbell chimes)
-BURNS (over speaker): <i>Welcome. Come in.</i>

280
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,940
<i>Ah, fresh victims for my</i>
<i>ever-growing army of the undead.</i>

281
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,692
SMITHERS: <i>Sir, you have</i>
<i>to let go of the button.</i>

282
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,483
BURNS: <i>Oh, son of a bit--</i>

283
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,445
Well, if it isn't
my good friends, the, uh--

284
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:21,076
-Simpson family, Master.
-Simpson, eh? Excellent.

285
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,170
Dad, do you notice
anything strange?

286
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,213
Yeah, his hairdo
looks so queer.

287
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,757
-I heard that!
-It was the boy!

288
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,594
(gasps)
Ooh! Punch!

289
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,507
Eww. Dad, this is blood.

290
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,807
Correction-- free blood.

291
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:44,518
Whoops. Bart and I
have to go wash up.

292
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,475
But you didn't get any
on me-- ugh-- wh--

293
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,816
Lisa, Burns isn't a vampire.

294
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,612
And even if he was, we're not gonna
stumble on his secret hiding place.

295
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,789
You're probably right.
Let's just go back. (gasps)

296
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,665
-Satisfied?
-Big deal.

297
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,211
It's no different from the basement
in Grampa's rest home.

298
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,665
Look!
(gasps)

299
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,925
Oh, my God!

300
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,097
(stammering)

301
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,641
Please, Bart.
I've seen your stupid Shemp.

302
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,857
Nyung, nyung,
nyung, nyung!

303
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,609
Yeah, I've seen
your Curly too.

304
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:33,111
-(growls)
-(screams)

305
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,540
I know I really shouldn't,
but when am I gonna be here again?

306
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,870
Whee!

307
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,537
-(growling)
-(screaming)

308
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,670
Well, if it isn't little...

309
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,627
uh, boy.

310
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,217
(screaming)

311
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:03,894
{\an8}Mom, Dad! Mr. Burns is
a vampire, and he has Bart!

312
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,976
{\an8}BURNS:
Why, Bart is right here.

313
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,941
Hello, Mother.
Hello, Father.

314
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,532
I missed you during
my uneventful absence.

315
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,938
Oh, Lisa,
you and your stories.

316
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,157
"Bart is a vampire."
"Beer kills brain cells."

317
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,069
Now, let's go back
to that

318
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,158
building thingy

319
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,623
where our beds and TV is.

320
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,131
(muttering)

321
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,458
(tapping)

322
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,707
(screaming)

323
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:37,127
Come join us, Lisa.
It's so cool.

324
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:40,467
You get to stay up
all night drinking blood.

325
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,394
And if you say
you're a vampire,

326
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,892
you get a free small soda
at the movies.

327
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,845
No! No!

328
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:50,395
Lisa, it's not like
you have a choice here.

329
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,737
(screams)

330
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,698
Bart! How many times have
I told you not to bite your sist--

331
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,199
(gasps) Wait a minute!
You are a vampire!

332
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,872
Quick!
We have to kill the boy!

333
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,911
How'd you know
he's a vampire?

334
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,075
He's a vampire?
Aaah!

335
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,714
(cackling)

336
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,591
Homer, we gotta do something.
Today, he's drinking people's blood.

337
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,589
Tomorrow,
he could be smoking.

338
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,931
The only way to get Bart back
is to kill the head vampire,

339
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,928
Mr. Burns.

340
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,470
Kill my boss? Do I dare
live out the American dream?

341
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,728
This is dangerous.

342
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,558
I wish we could have
found a sitter for Maggie.

343
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,814
(gasps)
Super Fun Happy Slide!

344
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,646
-No, Dad.
-Oh! I guess killing will be fun enough.

345
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,953
You must drive this stake
right through his heart.

346
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,161
Take that, vile fiend!

347
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,173
Uh, Dad,
that's his crotch.

348
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,131
(laughs)
Oh, sorry.

349
00:20:56,713 --> 00:21:01,303
-(screaming) No!
-(groaning)

350
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,596
(exhales)

351
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,232
-You're fired!
-D'oh!

352
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:13,359
It's so nice having
everything back to normal.

353
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:17,438
I'm a vampire, and I've come
to suck your blood.

354
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,436
Blah! Oh--

355
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,568
This cape is giving me a rash.

356
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,525
-Grampa's a vampire?
-We're all vampires.

357
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,946
But, no, we killed Mr. Burns.

358
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,615
You have to kill
the head vampire.

359
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,915
You're the head vampire?

360
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,709
No, I'm the head vampire!

361
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,013
(laughs)

362
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,758
-Mom?
-Well, I do have a life

363
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,380
outside this house, you know.

365
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,757
