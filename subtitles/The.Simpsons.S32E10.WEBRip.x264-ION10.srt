1
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:10,844
Okay, Mary,
you're a big city girl

2
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:13,213
who never stops to enjoy
the little things in life.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,415
And today, it all pays off.

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,452
Congratulations, Mary.

5
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,622
All the movies you've produced
for the Heartmark Channel

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,423
are huge hits!

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,259
I mean, Murder She Braised

8
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,461
scored in every single one
of our key demos.

9
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:31,431
Women 18 to 49
and women 49 and up.

10
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,967
Well, I'm very passionate
about telling stories

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,936
about homemakers
who solve mysteries.

12
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:38,639
How would you like
to be president

13
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,543
of our entire
Homemaker Mysteries division?

14
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,278
Thank you, sir. When do I start?

15
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,280
What? Hey, oh, not so fast.

16
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,949
One of our other movies is
in a little bit of trouble.

17
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:50,984
I need you to put out
a few fires

18
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:55,055
on the set of A Christmas
Ornament for Christmas.

19
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,424
A Christmas movie?

20
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,126
Mary, this is Heartmark.

21
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,161
Christmas movies are
our bread and butter.

22
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,896
You get this one back on track,

23
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:04,765
the promotion's yours.

24
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,267
I won't let you down.

25
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:09,002
But you hate Christmas.

26
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,838
No, I hate Christmas movies.

27
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,408
How can anyone hate
Christmas movies?

28
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,077
Trust me, I can.

29
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:20,247
Look, if I want the promotion,
I have to do this.

30
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,382
It's only for a few days.

31
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:25,018
You still don't know
how I take my coffee, do you?

32
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,020
Honey, we've been engaged
for two years.

33
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,855
When are you gonna
stop caring about that?

34
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,026
So where are they sending you?

35
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,562
The last small town
that can pass for Canada

36
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,564
passing for America
that didn't already have

37
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,866
another one of our
Christmas movies shooting in it.

38
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,942
So...

39
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,611
real exciting having you

40
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,546
big‐city movie guys around.

41
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,982
Christmas movie shot
in the summer.

42
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,950
Now, why do youse do that?

43
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,952
Well, it's for a variety
of reasons.

44
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,554
Oh, reasons!

45
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,656
Yeah, yeah, I figured, yeah.

46
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:04,091
And here you are.

47
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,562
Welcome to your Airbnb!

48
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,998
You must be Mary Tannenbaum.

49
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,666
I'm Marge Simpson.

50
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,334
Homer, the bags!

51
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,403
Yes, Mrs. Simpson.

52
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:23,510
<i>Welcome to our humble home</i>

53
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:27,681
<i>We have chargers
for your phone</i>

54
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,117
You know, I'm really tired.

55
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,552
Of course, let me show you

56
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,188
to the Bartholomew suite.

57
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,924
Oh, I can't believe
Mom gave her my room.

58
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,460
She's gonna shed
girl particles all over it.

59
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,596
Shut up, boy,
we're all in this together.

60
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,531
And by we, I mean me

61
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:48,068
bleeding this movie production
dry for 500 bucks a night.

62
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:50,537
Fine, then I'm sleeping
in my treehouse.

63
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,205
Heh, good luck.

64
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,107
I'm renting that out
to the sound effects guy.

65
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,813
Aw, man, what the...?

66
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,682
Please tell me you have Wi‐Fi.

67
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,184
Wi‐Fi do, that's news to me.

68
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,758
You work for Heartmark?

69
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:14,161
I've seen all
the Christmas movies.

70
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,329
Christmas at Cozy Manor.

71
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,565
A Soldier for Mommy
at Christmas.

72
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:21,868
Okay, okay,
in Flyover Country Christmas,

73
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:25,238
when Abigail found
the nest of reindeer eggs,

74
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,174
- what did she do...
- Look, I have no idea.

75
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,409
I never work
on Christmas movies.

76
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,944
What?

77
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,380
But they're the best ones.

78
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,615
Not for me.

79
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,517
I'm just here
to put out a few fires

80
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,353
and get home to the big city
and my surgeon fiancé.

81
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,422
Sounds handsome.

82
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,992
No rush.

83
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,265
Ta‐da!

84
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,101
It's not
the Sex and City brunches

85
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,570
you're used to,
but we do all right.

86
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,705
I don't know what goes on
an everything bagel,

87
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,308
so I just took a stab at it.

88
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,376
I actually don't eat bread.

89
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,846
Or dairy or whatever those are.

90
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,315
All right, gluten balls!

91
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,920
Ms. Tannenbaum?

92
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,631
Do you mind if I shoot
a behind‐the‐scenes documentary

93
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:19,426
about the movie to earn
my Little Filmmaker merit badge?

94
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:22,429
I don't really know
how to talk to kids.

95
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,097
Neither do I!

96
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,832
I'll see you on set.

97
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,702
Look, I'll just grab
something on my way.

98
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,504
Thanks so much.

99
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,574
Oh, why don't more foods come
in everything?

100
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,111
What can I get you, hon?

101
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:41,014
I'll have an extra‐tall, nonfat,
triple‐vegan espresso mocha,

102
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,183
clean white, two‐pump,
half‐barley water,

103
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,252
half‐macadamia milk
with room for air.

104
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,254
We got regular

105
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,723
and we got griddle drippings.

106
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,260
I'm sorry, is something funny?

107
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,263
Oh, just you city folk
and your legume milks.

108
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,865
That and this
Pearls Before Swine comic.

109
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:01,201
I was laughing
at both things simultaneously.

110
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,970
Well, at least in the city,
we don't all die at 60

111
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,039
from butter‐clogged
heart failure.

112
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,474
No, don't go.

113
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,576
Maybe they've got
some lentils you can milk.

114
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,645
Or acorns.

115
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,315
Ah, city folk.

116
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,751
They don't know the joys
of small‐town diners.

117
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,654
Like yelling gossip
across a crowded room.

118
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,657
Hey, Sea Captain, how's the IBS?

119
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,560
Yarr, if I'm calm, it's calm.

120
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,430
You tell Markie Post
that if she's got issues

121
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,866
with the script, I can have
Swoosie Kurtz on the next plane

122
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,668
out here and for half her price.

123
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,379
And if Swoosie Kurtz has
a problem with that,

124
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,004
Annie Potts is already here.

125
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,006
Great work, Mary,
but we've got more problems.

126
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,742
One, I directed a hundred
of these, they're all the same.

127
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,078
Two, our gazebo guy
has come down

128
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,914
with a nasty case
of carpenter's divorce.

129
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:52,953
Oh, why didn't I lock my iPad?!

130
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,754
Great. How will people know

131
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,357
this Christmas town is quaint
without multiple gazebos?

132
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:59,125
And when you got that
figured out,

133
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,195
some local nutjob has taken
down our Christmas stuff.

134
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:04,965
I'll take care of it.

135
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,533
It's you.

136
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,468
What do you think you're doing?

137
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,238
I'm setting up the town's annual
Lettuce and Tomato Festival.

138
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,974
It's our summertime tradition
in honor of too‐oft eaten,

139
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,143
but seldom celebrated workhorses
of barbecue season.

140
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,545
The whole town turns out.

141
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,480
We're trying
to shoot a movie here.

142
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,083
Well, if your movie is anything
like your gazebos,

143
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,652
you're looking at some major
structure problems,

144
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,320
and I should know.

145
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,191
How about this?

146
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,326
You build our gazebos,
and I'll make sure

147
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,595
they halt production
for your little festival.

148
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,697
All right, you've got,

149
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,734
as you say in the big city,
a deal.

150
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:50,176
And... good enough.
Or whatever. Who cares really?

151
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,080
Okay, movie's back on schedule,
under budget,

152
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,183
and our shipment of cozy scarves
was released from customs.

153
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,552
Ah, looks like
mission accomplished, Mary.

154
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,121
You know it, Cab Driver.

155
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,956
I can't wait to get home
to my condo,

156
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,225
my gay best friend
and my surgeon fiancé.

157
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,494
And I'll never have
to work on a...

158
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,529
Christmas movie again.

159
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,801
Hello, sir.

160
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,836
Yes, everything's
been taken care of.

161
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,406
You want me to stay
for the entire shoot?

162
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,008
And if I leave
I won't get the promotion?

163
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,811
And I have an annoying way
of talking on the phone?

164
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,379
Yes, sir.

165
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,450
It had to be a Christmas movie.

166
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:37,157
But Samantha,
I can't go caroling with you.

167
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,758
Your Christmas megastore's
gonna put

168
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,569
my mom‐and‐pop ornament shop
out of business.

169
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,996
Oh, Bruce, all I cared about
was my career,

170
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,165
but then we had that moment
at Christmas Creek,

171
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,900
and things changed.

172
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,601
Cut! Cut!

173
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,103
You idiots are using the names

174
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,105
from the last one of these
we shot.

175
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,374
You're Sondra and Jeff now.

176
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,843
Don't worry. We can just
dub the names in later.

177
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,278
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

178
00:07:58,345 --> 00:07:59,779
None of this matters.

179
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,148
All right, moving on
to the...

180
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,719
The golden retriever
Christmas sweater fashion show.

181
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,557
Simpson House Airbnb...

182
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,726
home of the original
gluten ball.

183
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,661
Free parking on Flanders' lawn.

184
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,797
Oh, Dad,
the house is too full already.

185
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,799
I slept in the bathtub
last night.

186
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:23,036
I woke up
with drain marks on my face.

187
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,571
Suck it up, Drain Face.

188
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,040
This movie production's
a gold mine.

189
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:30,977
Hey, how would you fellas like
to sleep in my marital bed?

190
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:37,517
Yup. Nothing like the magic
of a fully‐funded Hollywood set.

191
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:41,354
Who to gouge? Who to gouge?

192
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,491
Well, bad news.
We're all out of fake snow.

193
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,192
So use one of the other brands...

194
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,895
Drift King, Flurry Slurry,
Blizzard Butter.

195
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,196
No, there's none left.

196
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,698
Heartmark is shooting at least

197
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,100
50 other Christmas movies
as we speak.

198
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,668
I don't care how much it costs.

199
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,437
Just find me some fake snow.

200
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:00,206
Fake snow?
More like easy dough.

201
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:03,610
How hard could it be
to find white stuff to grind up?

202
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,046
Would you mind taking a break?

203
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,557
We're about
to shoot the pivotal scene

204
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,982
where the two leads realize

205
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,484
they're starting
to like each other.

206
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,885
Well, well,

207
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,655
the big city gal
is telling me to slow down.

208
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,657
There's a humorous reversal
for you.

209
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,392
The gazebos look great.

210
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,160
You're very talented.

211
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,262
Oh, only with my hands.

212
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:04,671
Hey there!
What a nice surprise!

213
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,506
Hey, babe.
How are things in the boondocks?

214
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,074
God, you must be miserable.

215
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:11,578
Oh, yeah, I'm surrounded
by a bunch of backwoods,

216
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,513
lotto‐scratching,
monster‐truck‐driving,

217
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,415
Big‐Gulp‐guzzling bumpkins.

218
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,684
I can't wait
to go back to the city.

219
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,687
Well, it'll all be worth it when
you get your big promotion...

220
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:23,123
movie executive
for a greeting card company.

221
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,191
See? I listen.

222
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,372
Okay, there's nowhere else
to sleep.

223
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,508
I have no choice.

224
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,077
Ay, caramba!

225
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,846
Okay, ladies,
let's get this over with.

226
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:57,056
No more girlie stuff.
Lights out.

227
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:00,460
As you wish, Prince Pajama Foot.

228
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:18,110
Most people think
the capital is New York,

229
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,444
but it's Albany.

230
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,847
Most people.

231
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,450
Oh, my God.
She's sleep‐nerding.

232
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,858
Can I sleep in here
with you guys?

233
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,562
Oh, sorry, kid,
no room at the inn.

234
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,364
That's it!

235
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,599
I am getting my room back!

236
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,038
Tough day?

237
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,707
Would you like some tea?

238
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,809
I found the brand
Gwyneth Paltrow likes.

239
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,378
I think you take it orally.

240
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,780
Well, do you have any wine?

241
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,717
Wine? Why, yes. Yes, I do.

242
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:01,487
I'm moving into
quirky best friend territory.

243
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,155
So, we were supposed to shoot

244
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,224
the big Christmas tree lighting
scene tomorrow,

245
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,026
but it turns out Springfield has

246
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,395
a very aggressive
beaver population.

247
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:14,767
So no more
big town‐wide celebration.

248
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,402
But you need that!

249
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,938
That's the part in every
Heartmark Christmas movie

250
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,773
where everybody comes together,

251
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,376
and the jaded outsider
is finally won over.

252
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:27,513
Well, we don't have the time
or money or creativity

253
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,615
to come up with something new.

254
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:33,285
So unless Springfield already
has some big event tomorrow,

255
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:36,856
that's already decorated
in Christmas colors...

256
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:53,772
Great work, Mary.

257
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,874
This movie
just might be good enough

258
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,442
to fold laundry to.

259
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:59,511
How are you gonna explain
all the produce

260
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,513
and people wearing shorts?

261
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,220
Eh, so long
as the attractive white people

262
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,285
make with the closed‐mouth
smooches, nobody's complaining.

263
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,722
What is going on here?

264
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,091
I leave to pick up
my I‐heart‐Bibb bibs,

265
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:17,229
and you turn my summer festival
into a holiday set piece!

266
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,398
I thought we had a deal.

267
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:24,403
But look,
everyone's having a great time.

268
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:26,869
Hey, Skinner, I never thought
the Lettice and Tomato Festival

269
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:29,575
could get any better...
but Christmas!

270
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:33,745
Yeah. Makes Okratoberfest
seem ridiculous in comparison.

271
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,750
All I gotta do
is ruin this movie.

272
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,953
Then I get my room back.

273
00:13:45,857 --> 00:13:49,161
- Hey!
- Hey!

274
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:57,436
Aw, no, this is the worst thing
to happen to this movie

275
00:13:57,502 --> 00:13:59,004
since someone wrote it.

276
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,773
Okay, that's a wrap for today.

277
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,810
- Help. Help!
- Help! Help, help!

278
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:06,478
We're trapped.

279
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:10,382
It had to be a Christmas movie.

280
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,422
Zero bars.

281
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,125
Well, we'll just have to dig
our way out.

282
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:24,062
What the hell
is this fake snow made of?

283
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,397
I have no idea.

284
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,499
We paid some local lunatic
to grind it for us.

285
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,301
Well, I hope you're happy.

286
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,737
First you ruin my festival,
and now this.

287
00:14:31,803 --> 00:14:33,171
People loved it!

288
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:35,807
You heard that pair of
nuclear engineering simpletons.

289
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:37,809
Oh, Lenny and Carl
like everything.

290
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:39,077
That's their affect.

291
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,313
Is it getting hotter in here?

292
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,482
It would appear
our heated verbal sparring

293
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:45,484
is upping the temperature
in this confined space.

294
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,619
Well, I guess
we should agree not to talk.

295
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,354
- Fine.
- Fine.

296
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,701
Maybe this'll cool you down.

297
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:04,970
Thanks.

298
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:13,812
Look, I'm sorry
I ruined your festival.

299
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,048
No, you made it better.

300
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:19,384
People seemed to actually be
showing up on purpose this year.

301
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,586
Springfield's lucky
to have someone like you

302
00:15:21,653 --> 00:15:23,889
who cares so much
about small‐town values.

303
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:28,760
Sure is hot in here.

304
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,762
Perhaps we should huddle closer.

305
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,130
For coolness.

306
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:42,741
Good morning.

307
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,176
How did you get out?

308
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:46,011
Well, luckily,
the fake snow hardened,

309
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,946
and I was able to dig my way out

310
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,682
with this shoehorn
I always carry on my person.

311
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,317
God, you're handy.

312
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:55,854
One extra‐tall, nonfat,
triple‐vegan espresso mocha,

313
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,856
clean white,
two‐pump, half‐barley water,

314
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:00,625
half‐macadamia milk
with room for air.

315
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:03,595
- You remembered.
- Who could forget it?

316
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,534
Mary?

317
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:12,037
So this is why
you didn't answer my calls.

318
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,705
No! It's not what it looks like!

319
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:16,108
He's just the gazebo builder.

320
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,314
You took my room from me,
movie lady.

321
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,050
And now it's payback time.

322
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,053
Hey, everybody! Want to see
what this Heartmark phony

323
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,855
really thinks of you?

324
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,226
My footage!

325
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:35,794
Yeah.

326
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:39,064
I'm surrounded by a bunch
of backwoods, lotto‐scratching,

327
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,399
monster‐truck‐driving,

328
00:16:40,465 --> 00:16:41,900
Big Gulp‐guzzling bumpkins.

329
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,104
But we opened our hearts to you.

330
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,740
I let myself be whimsical
in front of you!

331
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:52,344
How dare you
not be charmed by us.

332
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,617
I may drive a monster truck,

333
00:16:58,683 --> 00:17:01,820
but the real monster is she!

334
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,526
Wait! I didn't mean it!

335
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:09,928
And we know all about your plans
to sell the town

336
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:13,131
to that big developer who wants
to turn it into condos.

337
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,767
No, I'm not.
How would I sell the town?

338
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,245
Yeah, all right.
Forget I said anything.

339
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,703
I took a shot.
I whiffed it.

340
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,038
Let's just... move on.

341
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,573
Mary, you got to do something.

342
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,242
Without these Big Gulp‐guzzling
bumpkins as extras,

343
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,044
we can't finish the movie.

344
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,712
Come back, everyone!

345
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:29,314
Come back.

346
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:35,053
I love it
when a shoot falls apart.

347
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,729
I was sent here
to put out fires.

348
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:49,835
How could you say those hurtful
things about Springfield?

349
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:53,405
I'm sorry, but working
on this movie's been so painful.

350
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:56,675
For me, Christmas is the least
wonderful time of the year.

351
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:58,276
But the song says the most.

352
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,312
I know what the song says!

353
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,183
There's a reason
I hate Christmas movies.

354
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,255
It all started one winter,

355
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,190
when a movie production
came to town.

356
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,960
My dad thought
it'd be fun to be an extra.

357
00:18:15,026 --> 00:18:17,095
They cast him
as a store employee

358
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:19,364
in a scene where crazed parents
stormed in

359
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,199
to get the hottest toy.

360
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,901
He was trampled to death.

361
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,870
You can still see
his last moments on Earth

362
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:27,038
in the trailer for...

363
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:29,708
Jingle All the Way.

364
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,645
And now I've lost everything,

365
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,647
my fiancé, my dream job

366
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:36,815
and, worst of all,

367
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,217
the respect of a small town.

368
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,887
Then you do like Springfield.

369
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:43,388
I've come to love this place,

370
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,990
with its homespun ways,

371
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:46,825
its earnest, hardworking folk

372
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,561
and its wonderful
airbed‐and‐breakfasts.

373
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,062
I guess what I'm saying is,

374
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:53,231
I'm really gonna miss you all.

375
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,237
Airport, please.

376
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,405
Right away.

377
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,407
I just got to make
one quick stop.

378
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,445
The simple townsfolk are
rebuilding the set!

379
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:09,247
It's a miracle!

380
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,918
We're gonna be able to finish
this piece of crap after all.

381
00:19:15,186 --> 00:19:17,188
You. But how?

382
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:20,525
I gave a rousing speech
about how our Gulps might be big

383
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,294
and our trucks might be monster

384
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,896
but our hearts
are enlarged as well.

385
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:28,400
And I secretly filmed you saying
nice things to my mom.

386
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:31,036
And I showed the whole town.

387
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:34,205
Yeah, and we saw that was
the real youse.

388
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:38,243
Thank you for showing me
that small towns

389
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,211
are the best‐sized towns of all

390
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:42,714
and Christmas movies
are the best movies,

391
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,716
because everything
always works out,

392
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,751
no matter how contrived.

393
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,054
Now let's finish this movie.

394
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,057
Mary, wait, I...

395
00:19:52,123 --> 00:19:53,601
I don't know
what happened in that gazebo,

396
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,726
but I don't care!

397
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:55,994
So who's it gonna be,

398
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,462
me or him?

399
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,099
Darling, you're perfect.

400
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,635
But maybe life isn't
about perfect.

401
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,837
Skinner...
I don't know your first name.

402
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,340
You're the one who remembered
how I like my coffee,

403
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:10,609
and that's why I choose you.

404
00:20:13,144 --> 00:20:14,079
Are you nuts?

405
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:15,180
Pick him!

406
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:17,015
He's a thousand times better
than me.

407
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,350
He's a surgeon.

408
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,285
A handsome surgeon.

409
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,519
What was your plan?

410
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:22,854
Were you gonna move here?

411
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,589
Were we gonna share a car?

412
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,892
I'm getting dizzy just thinking
about your poor decision‐making.

413
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,429
This is twice now.

414
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,164
I know.

415
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:58,490
That was the worst movie
I've ever seen.

416
00:20:58,556 --> 00:21:00,792
That snow looked so fake.

417
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,560
Mom...

418
00:21:02,627 --> 00:21:03,627
No.

419
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:04,963
I don't care!

420
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,431
These movies are for moms

421
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:09,067
and their wine
and a cozy throw blanket

422
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,403
and a candle
that smells like a pine tree

423
00:21:11,469 --> 00:21:13,271
or hot apples.

424
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,839
If you're not any
of those things,

425
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:17,242
scram before
the next one starts.
