CHORUS: <i>The Simpsons</i>

(tires screeching)

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,216
D'oh! (screams)

4
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:12,472
(tires screeching)

5
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:16,096
HOMER: Ooh!

00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,577
{\an8}-(alarm beeping)
-McBain to base.

7
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,658
{\an8}Under attack by Commie Nazis.

8
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,334
(beeping)

9
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:49,917
They won't stop me from delivering
these UNICEF pennies.

10
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,091
(grunts)

11
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,718
(grunts) Go, pennies.

12
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:59,055
Help the puny children who need you.

13
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:02,192
{\an8}Wow. McBain is really buffed up.

14
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,230
{\an8}You could grate cheese on those abs.

15
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,194
{\an8}Yeah. But can he do this?

16
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,914
{\an8}(sighs)

17
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,158
{\an8}(shudders)

18
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,962
<i>-I surrender.</i>
<i>-Not so fast.</i>

19
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:31,128
{\an8}That's what I call
breakneck speed. (laughs)

20
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,296
{\an8}Mom, a man just died.

21
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:37,604
{\an8}(groans) Anyway, it's time for
the church picnic.

22
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,350
{\an8}What? They had a picnic last week.

23
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:44,313
{\an8}No, they didn't. You just brought a bucket
of chicken to church.

24
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,765
{\an8}If God didn't want us to eat in church

25
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,686
{\an8}he would have made gluttony a sin.

26
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:00,953
Hey!

27
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,997
(all laughing)

28
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,331
{\an8}(chuckles) Ah, the joke's on you.

29
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,956
{\an8}We borrowed that jar from your table.

30
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,134
{\an8}So you just shot your own mustard.

31
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,673
Aw, nuts.

32
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,546
{\an8}HOMER: Ooh. Still plenty of parking.

33
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,014
{\an8}(children chattering)

34
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,474
{\an8}Nice to see you, Homer.

35
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,465
Yeah. Out of my way, whoever you are.
You're blocking the food.

36
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,858
{\an8}(giggling)

37
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,939
{\an8}Ah, there's nothing like
a good old-fashioned picnic.

38
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,895
How's my kite doing, Smithers?

39
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,736
{\an8}Oh, it's, uh, soaring majestically, sir.

40
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,242
{\an8}You're it.

41
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,373
{\an8}We'll see about that. After him, Smithers.

42
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,331
Aaah! You're not it!

43
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,000
Gentlemen, the game is capture the flag.

44
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:52,303
-Rod, ladies pick first.
-OK. I choose... Todd.

45
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,591
Oh! Oh! Oh! Bart! Bart! Bart!

46
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,045
Over here! Over here!

47
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,465
-Um, I'll take...
-MILHOUSE: Pick me! Pick me!

48
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,604
Nelson.

49
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,639
{\an8}Saving the best for last, huh, Bart?

50
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,516
{\an8}Yeah. That must be it.

51
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:10,693
I pick my dad. Do you want to
play capture the flag, Daddy?

52
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,855
(chuckles) Sports on a Sunday?

53
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,953
{\an8}Hmm. I better check with Reverend--

54
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,909
LOVEJOY: Oh, just play the damn game, Ned.

55
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,529
Yeah. Well, if you get
a grown-up, then so do we.

56
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,237
-I pick my dad.
-(snoring)

57
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,458
{\an8}-NELSON: Him?
-Well, you'd be surprised.

58
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,498
He gets pretty competitive
when he's drinking.

59
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,544
Come on, Dad.
We're playing capture the flag.

60
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,167
Sorry, Son. Daddy's down for the day.

61
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,264
Why don't you go capture me
some more potato salad.

62
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,180
{\an8}But Rod picked his dad.
It's a matter of family honor.

63
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,140
{\an8}Flanders is playing?
Why didn't you say so?

64
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,182
(grunting)

65
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,305
(sighs) Oh. It appears

66
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,315
I will have to find a new
fortress of solitude.

67
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,492
OK, Dad. They've got our flag
guarded pretty good.

68
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,071
I agree. Let's surrender.

69
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,326
No. Wait. I have a plan.
But I'll need your underpants.

70
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,999
Hmm. All right. But don't lose 'em.
They're my only pair.

71
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,917
I got it! I got the flag!

72
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,709
-(all shouting)
-Get him! Get him! He's getting away!

73
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,546
(chuckles) Stupid kids.

74
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,301
{\an8}Pin him!

75
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,391
-(all grunting)
-This isn't the flag.

76
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,430
It looks more like-Ew!

77
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:29,055
{\an8}(laughs) Suckers. Go, Dad!

78
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,063
(panting)

79
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,725
-(all shouting)
-(panting, wheezing)

80
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,565
-(shouting continues)
-MILHOUSE: He's getting away!

81
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,992
(panting)

82
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,411
{\an8}Come on, Dad. Just a few more feet.
Show 'em what you got.

83
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,291
(panting)

84
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,748
MILHOUSE: Go! Get him! Go! Go!

85
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,371
{\an8}MILHOUSE: Tag him! Tag him!

86
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,996
-Tag him! Quick! Tag him!
-Time out! Time out!

87
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,254
Oh, I don't think he can get up.

88
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,706
-Let's egg him!
-ALL: yeah!

89
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,091
(all shouting, laughing)

90
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,805
(shouting) Ow! Stop it!

91
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,139
Hey. He's trying to turn over.

92
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,185
(all shouting)

93
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,610
(whimpering)

94
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,981
(groans)

95
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,910
HOMER: I've never seen
Bart so ashamed of me.

96
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:30,541
{\an8}Oh, Marge. How could you let me
let myself go like this?

97
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,671
Me? I'm not the one
who puts butter in your coffee.

98
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah. Well, I've humiliated
my son for the last time.

99
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:40,796
{\an8}-I'm going to get into shape.
-Whatever you say, sweetie.

100
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,682
No. I mean it.
I'm really serious this time.

101
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,430
{\an8}OK, honey. OK. I'll start taking in
all your slacks.

102
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,434
(laughs)

103
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:56,855
(grunts)

104
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,526
-(panting)
-OK, boy.

105
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,025
I want you to keep this exercise thing
under your hat.

106
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,197
That way,
I won't be embarrassed if I fail.

107
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,696
-(barks)
-(screeches)

108
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,958
Oh, great. Now the cat knows.

109
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,710
OK. Here we go.

110
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,753
(panting)

111
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,716
{\an8}Oh!

112
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,813
(growling)

113
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:33,851
(inhales deeply)
Look, son. Daddy got in shape.

114
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,055
(exhales deeply)

115
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,395
{\an8}(groans) Oh.

116
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,400
{\an8}I've gotta keep trying.

117
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,074
{\an8}Or I could just move that picture.

118
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,491
{\an8}No. The picture looked good where it was.

119
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,410
{\an8}Boy, drag me back outside.

120
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,370
(growling)

121
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:52,999
(panting)

122
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,459
(groans) D'oh!

123
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,502
Hey!

124
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:05,168
(groans) D'oh! (groans)

125
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,298
-(bell dings)
-(panting)

126
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,135
(snoring)

127
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:13,984
-Hmm? (clears throat)
-So what will it be, Mr. Simpson?

128
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,808
Your usual bucket of ice cream
covered with miniature pies?

129
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,864
Uh, don't you have anything healthy here?

130
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,569
{\an8}Oh, well, we do have
some low-salt candy bars

131
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,570
{\an8}and some reduced-fat soda.

132
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:28,067
{\an8}And our beef jerky
is now nearly rectum-free.

133
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,326
Hey. These Powersauce bars
look pretty healthy.

134
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:35,199
Oh, yes. That is a new item.
No bar contains more applesauce.

135
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,748
Hmm.

136
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,881
"A bushel of apples packed in each bar

137
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,838
plus the secret ingredient
that unleashes...

138
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,588
the awesome power of apples."

139
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,801
Wow!

140
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,677
(mispronouncing) "Gym"? what's a "gym"?

141
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,020
(mispronounces) Oh. A "gym."

142
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,240
Ow. Ow.

143
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,069
Boy, I'm feeling this. Ow.

144
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,735
Ooh, my head's gonna be sore in
the morning. (grunts)

145
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,874
Excuse me. You're doing
this station all backwards.

146
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,832
-Let me show you how to do it like a man.
-(gasps)

147
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,794
Rainier Wolfcastle!
Oh, I love your movies

148
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,335
and your Powersauce bars
and your taught, rippling--

149
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,549
Hey, hey, hey. That's enough.
Now step over to the Abdominator...

150
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,012
and I will shout slogans at you.

151
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,639
-(grunting)
-Push. Harder.

152
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:37,601
Go past the max. Reach over the top.
Master your ass.

153
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,639
{\an8}(crackling)

154
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,397
(grunting)

155
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,859
Wow, Wolfie. Two months ago I didn't know
what the word dumbbell meant.

156
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,692
-This place is great.
-Mm-hmm.

157
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,664
Hello, handsome. Nice muscles.

158
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,622
Care for a rubdown?

159
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,622
Oh! Well, I'm flattered but spoken for.

160
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,539
Oh, what the heck. Give me your number.

161
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,632
{\an8}Dad, what have you done to your stomach?

162
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,381
{\an8}-And your chest.
-And your shirt!

163
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:13,054
I have been working out secretly at night.
And look at me now!

164
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,635
{\an8}Oh, my goodness gracious!

165
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,851
(chuckles) Go ahead.
Try and grab some flab.

166
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,853
Go on! No. Not there.

167
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,935
Not there either. Over here.

168
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,900
{\an8}-I've got some.
-No. Here. Try my foot.

169
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,862
No. Not that foot. Just feel my biceps.

170
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,493
{\an8}-Ooh!
-Whoa!

171
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,741
Well, what do you think
of your old man now, Son?

172
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,414
-(grunts)
-whoa!

173
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,582
Damn right.

174
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,495
How can you put
that filth into your bodies?

175
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,795
My casserole is not filth.

176
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,009
-Eat it.
-Look at you people.

177
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,930
Bart's a tub.
Lisa's weak as a little girl.

178
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,300
And Maggie doesn't seem
to be growing at all.

179
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,307
-Now that's just not--
-You too, Marge.

180
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:02,309
if you toned up a little, you'd probably
get a lot more action. (clicks tongue)

181
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:06,613
Homer, stop insulting us
and eat your filth. Food. I mean food.

182
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,479
Sorry. I only eat food in bar form.

183
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:13,487
When you concentrate food,
you unleash its awesome power, I'm told.

184
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,741
That's why I'm compressing
five pounds of spaghetti...

185
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,583
into one handy, mouth-size bar.

186
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,705
(gulps)

187
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,328
-hmm.
-(beeping)

188
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,376
-(line rings)
-Hospital, please.

189
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,708
(grunting)

190
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,916
Homer, please remember to wipe your sweat
off that machine.

191
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,428
I got a terrible rash yesterday.

192
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,350
You know Rainier Wolfcastle?

193
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,929
Yeah. He helped me blast through
the burn and ride the zone.

194
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,426
(grunting)

195
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,017
Yo, yo, Rainier, my man. How you doing?

196
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,193
I thought you'd be here
pumping those guns.

197
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,282
We've come up with a killer
promotion for Powersauce bars.

198
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,989
-Picture this. You--
-I love it.

199
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,070
Climb the highest mountain in Springfield.

200
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,156
The Murderhorn.

201
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,700
Are you crazy? That's suicide.

202
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,365
(scoffs) Sure! For experienced
mountain climbers.

203
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:07,464
{\an8}But you're a movie star. And you'll have
the Powersauce edge.

204
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:11,001
{\an8}Not for all the applesauce
in Glückenschlabel.

205
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:17,182
{\an8}My dad could do it. He eats 50 dollars'
worth of Powersauce bars a day.

206
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,180
{\an8}Overshoot the extreme.
Max the envelope and so on.

207
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:24,393
Wow. He's really been
paying attention to our slogans.

208
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,845
Brad, a word?

209
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:31,645
New angle, Joe Schlub eats Powersauce bar,
becomes world's mightiest man.

210
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,612
It's believable.
That's what I like about it.

211
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,201
-Congratulations, sir.
-Huh?

212
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,119
You're gonna be the first man
to climb the Murderhorn.

213
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,159
I am?

214
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,042
Uh, no. That's it over there.

215
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,455
(gasps)

216
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,999
{\an8}Yeah. That's it.

217
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,628
{\an8}Just to the right
of the one you're looking at.

218
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,889
(whimpers)

219
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,256
(whimpers) Oh.

220
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,598
HOMER: OK. Mountain climbing supplies.

221
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,975
{\an8}Rope. Ice ax. Heart medicine.

222
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,983
Son, don't go up that mountain.

223
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,315
You'll die up there, just like I did.

224
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,242
You? "Did"?

225
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,820
Sure. It was the winter of '28.

226
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:26,747
<i>The Butter Baby Flapjack Company</i>
<i>sponsored me and a fella named McAllister.</i>

227
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:32,169
<i>We were almost to the top</i>
<i>when we ran low on supplies.</i>

228
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,344
<i>Heroically,</i>
<i>I gave him the last short stack.</i>

229
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:46,217
<i>Then that glory hog took all the supplies</i>
<i>and headed for the top alone.</i>

230
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,017
(screaming)

231
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:54,614
I fell 8,000 feet onto
a pile of jagged rocks.

232
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,400
Of course, folks were
tougher in those days.

233
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,985
I was jitterbugging that very night.

234
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,870
But that skunk McAllister
was never seen again.

235
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,949
If you're trying to scare me,
it won't work.

236
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,706
I'm 100% focused on my goal.

237
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,629
Hey. My hat has earflaps.

238
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,628
And when he reaches the top,
Mr. Simpson here

239
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,961
will plant this Powersauce
flag as an eternal symbol...

240
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,128
of mans contempt for nature.

241
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,137
Wait. Is "contempt" the word I want here?

242
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,434
Homer, you're the world's greatest hero.

243
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,354
Do you owe it all to Powersauce?

244
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,232
That's right, Brad and Neil.

245
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:34,229
I only eat Powersauce,
the bar with "applesauceicity."

246
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,533
Has anyone mentioned that Homer doesn't
know anything about mountain climbing...

247
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,649
and that this is all crazy?

248
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,816
Well, yes. A number of people.
But don't worry.

249
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:46,115
We're sending two Sherpas along as guides.

250

251
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,289
Aw. Good-bye, everyone.

252
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,253
-Don't touch my stuff.
-Dad, wait.

253
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,884
You're not risking your life
just to impress me, are you?

254
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,973
Well, yeah.

255
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,928
Oh, cool. Now get going. Chop-chop.

256
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,965
Remember our agreement. He can't fail.

259
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,241
Uh, Dad...

260
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,871
shouldn't you save a couple bottles
for when you're a little higher?

261
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:32,332
Bart, this climb is the most
difficult ordeal I have ever faced.

262
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:37,174
Don't get discouraged, Dad.
Only four vertical miles to go.

263
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,631

(sighs)

269
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,693
Wow. Look how far I climbed.

270
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,735
And I'm not even tired.

271

my last thoughts were of her...

341
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,545
blinding and torturing Abe Simpson.

342
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,128
Cheerio."

343
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:38,262
(groans) My dad's a disgrace,
just like Bart's dad!

344
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,636
Me! (sobs)

345
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:52,015
This may not be the top, but it's as close
as a Simpsons ever gonna get.

346
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,857
This is for you, Son.

347
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,862
(grunting)

348
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,453
(gasping)

349
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,460
Uh-oh. Hey.

350
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,205
Wait a minute.

351
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:19,297
I'm on the top. I actually did it!

352
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,684
I climbed the unclimbable mountain!

353
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:27,102
Bow down before me, everyone,
for I am your king!

354
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,822
{\an8}Family to Dad. Family to Dad.
Come in, Dad. (static)

355
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,899
Uh, I'm pretty sure
he's dead, little girl.

356
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,994
{\an8}Here. Have a Powersauce bar.
It's on the house.

357
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,281
{\an8}Hey. Something's comir down
the mountain-fast!

358
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,405
Oh, no! He fell! I can't look!

359
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,043
(faint shouting)

360
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:56,916
-Hi.
-Oh, Homie! You're alive!

361
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,255
Oh, Marge. I never thought
you'd see me again.

362
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,262
Where in the world did you
find a sled on top of the--

363
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,345
(screams)

364
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,980
{\an8}-(all gasping)
-We're too late. He's dead.

365
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,267
{\an8}It looks like someone tried to eat him.

366
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,228
What are you looking at me for?

367
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,645
You're all crazy. Crazy as a--

368
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,117
OK. Here's what I think happened.

369
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,963
{\an8}Did you make it
to the top, Dad? Huh? Did ya?

370
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,918
{\an8}Why don't you tell me, Son?

371
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,790
{\an8}See any interesting flags up there?

372
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,757
All I see is a pole.
Maybe the flag fell off.

373
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,841
Ah, damn it!

374
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,514
{\an8}Forget about it, Homer.
You made it to the top.

375
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,643
You're the coolest dad ever.

376
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:49,271
Thanks, Bart.
That makes it all worthwhile.

377
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,393
-Is that your wallet?
-D'oh!

378
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,782
(theme music playing)

379
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,397
-(murmuring)
-Shh!
