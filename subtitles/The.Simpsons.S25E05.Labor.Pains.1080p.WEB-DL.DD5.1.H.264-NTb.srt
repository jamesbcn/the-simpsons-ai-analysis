Hmph!

22
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:56,003
Did you know some historians think American
football is based on an ancient Aztec game?

23
00:01:56,024 --> 00:01:58,605
It's not American football,
it's just football.

24
00:01:58,624 --> 00:02:01,058
Bart, you're not annoyed
that Milhouse asked me

25
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:03,900
to go to the American
football game instead of you?

26
00:02:03,952 --> 00:02:06,415
- Mom, Lisa's ruining football.
- American football.

27
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:09,299
No time for breakfast, Marge.
Just give me a banana.

29
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,394
Now, listen. I have
to work late tonight.

30
00:02:19,762 --> 00:02:23,170
Again? I was hoping you could
spend some time with the kids.

31
00:02:23,194 --> 00:02:26,396
It's a tough economy. Money
doesn't grow on trees.

32
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:28,951
It grows on threes.

33
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:30,686

34
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,771
- Yeah, I'm out.
- Me, too.

35
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:36,298
Too rich for my blood. I should
not have anted with my blood.

36
00:02:37,705 --> 00:02:40,278
Whew. You got the
touch tonight, Homer.

00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:15,454
I think it's Obama.

No, no.

58

I'm timing my contractions.

59
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:29,548

Everyone has a cell phone.
Mine's at home.

Everything will be fine.

67

Um... Oh you, uh,
you like movies?

68
00:03:49,642 --> 00:03:51,687
This reminds me of
that scene in <i>Alien.</i>

69
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:52,475

70
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,655

Aw, well, that's sweet.

Listen, I'm glad I'm not
going through this alone.

73
00:04:00,043 --> 00:04:01,899
I haven't seen
my boyfriend in months.

74
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:05,028
Oh, uh, he was just here.

75
00:04:05,053 --> 00:04:06,516
No, he wasn't.

76
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:07,653
But thanks for lying.

77
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,543
You like lies? Here's a few:

78
00:04:09,556 --> 00:04:12,165
College is expensive
but it's worth it.

79
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:13,771
I think the baby's coming.

80
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:16,221
Okay Homer, remember
your Lamaze training.

81
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:22,176
Now, this next position is fantastic for
women who are carrying especially big.

82
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,944
Homer, can you demonstrate?

83
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:25,514
Mm-hmm.

picked a name yet.

88
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:36,518

89
00:04:36,558 --> 00:04:39,033
- No, I didn't.
- I'm talking to the baby.

90

Here it comes.

91
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:43,564
Um, I don't know how
to tell you this,

92
00:04:43,598 --> 00:04:46,576
- but your baby doesn't have any legs.
- What?

93
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:47,775

Oh, no, I'm shopping for Homer Jr.,
a baby I delivered in an elevator

200
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,893
the night I pretended to go to
work but was really playing poker.

a subsidiary of your penis.

00:10:00,944 --> 00:10:05,088
Oh, yes, I'm shopping for
Maggie, our baby together,

206
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:06,942
so this looks
perfectly innocent.

207
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,617
Why are you saying that?

208
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,062
Oh, you know how the
first few weeks are:

209
00:10:11,081 --> 00:10:14,151
sleep deprived, walking
around in a fog.

210
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:15,698
First few weeks of what?

211
00:10:15,729 --> 00:10:17,408
Um, November.

212
00:10:17,524 --> 00:10:18,768

213
00:10:18,797 --> 00:10:20,498
(grunting, low chatter)

214
00:10:20,975 --> 00:10:22,094
Hey, Atomette.

215
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,027
I want to say... Caitlin?

216
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:28,084
Lisa. Guys, do you realize you're
being exploited by this team?

217
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,563
ALL:
Wha...?

218
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,000
They sell your posters,

219
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,298
workout DVDs,

220
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:35,464
and all of your practices
are broadcast on a webcam.

221
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:42,778
And some of the angles...

222
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:44,695
are low.

223
00:10:44,902 --> 00:10:49,151
But don't worry, collective bargaining
will enable us to secure concessions.

224
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,552
Uh, we're gonna push 'em back,

225
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:56,141
push 'em back, push
'em way, way back.

226
00:10:56,185 --> 00:10:57,885
All the way to a new contract.

227
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,963
'Cause union power is a fact.

228
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:01,582
And we're...

229
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:03,246
Okay, okay, we get it.

230
00:11:03,264 --> 00:11:05,027
Well, look who's here.

231
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:08,089
You been hit by the
cheerleading bug, little lady?

232
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:11,587
Actually, I've been hit by the
unfair labor practices bug.

233
00:11:11,885 --> 00:11:15,154
What? Why, that's
Samuel Gompers talk.

234
00:11:15,183 --> 00:11:18,774
Now, little missy, the only
thing you should be organizin'

235
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:20,259
is your dollies.

236
00:11:20,362 --> 00:11:23,557
How? By size, brand, value?

237
00:11:23,574 --> 00:11:25,971
And don't even suggest race,
'cause I don't see that.

238
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:27,924
I just see little people I own.

239
00:11:27,952 --> 00:11:29,394
What do you say, ladies?

240
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,738
(indistinct whispering)

241
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:35,169
Not right, not fair. Let's
say it with our hair.

242
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,322
Okay, fine.

243
00:11:41,344 --> 00:11:46,456
I'm gonna give it some thought, then
say no in the nicest way possible.

244
00:11:46,988 --> 00:11:48,356
No.

245
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:54,787
Oh, good.

246
00:11:54,811 --> 00:11:56,317
Nice.

247
00:11:56,819 --> 00:11:57,914
"Beat Dallas."

248
00:11:57,934 --> 00:11:59,697
Can never argue with that.

249
00:12:00,556 --> 00:12:05,453
Hey, ladies. My vest isn't the
only thing that's ripped.

250
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,047
I am in the market for
a backup mistress.

251
00:12:08,071 --> 00:12:09,405
Possibly two.

252
00:12:09,451 --> 00:12:11,282
Have you kids seen your father?

253
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:13,946
Surprised he's not here
ogling these girls.

254
00:12:13,987 --> 00:12:17,342
- He said he was going to work.
- On a Friday afternoon?

255
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:18,157
(gasps)

256
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:20,363
I bet he's playing poker again.

257
00:12:20,387 --> 00:12:22,888
Coming through.
Wife on a mission.

258
00:12:22,913 --> 00:12:25,662
Go, fight, win. Marge.

259
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:29,992
Wow, I've never burst
through a banner before,

260
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:31,983
but it really does the trick.

261
00:12:32,095 --> 00:12:33,699
(pounding on door)

262
00:12:33,716 --> 00:12:37,282
Homer, I know you're here.
Your car's outside.

263
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:40,719
- Where is he?
- I honestly don't know.

264
00:12:40,737 --> 00:12:44,943
I'm just teaching myself massage here
with online videos and a store mannequin.

265
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:47,521
Oh, I'm so sorry.

266
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,435
So, do you have any injuries
I should know about? Oh!

267
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:53,947
Hmm, if he's not in
there, where is he?

268
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:55,489
HOMER:
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

269
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:58,071
<i>Oh, baby, shake it. Homer like.</i>

270
00:12:58,086 --> 00:12:58,858
(gasps)

271
00:12:58,883 --> 00:13:00,445
Oh.

272
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:04,486
Shake it. Now, roll over on your
tummy, just like I taught you.

273
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:06,864
<i>Tell me what a cow says.</i>

274
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:08,660
(toy moos)

275
00:13:08,761 --> 00:13:10,295
Aah!
My other baby mama.

276
00:13:10,313 --> 00:13:12,447
So this is where
you've been going.

277
00:13:12,474 --> 00:13:14,942
Another woman's apartment.

278
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:16,778
Marge, it's not what you think.

279
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:18,713
Quiet. You're
upsetting Homer Jr.

280
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:21,141
(quietly): You have
a baby together?

281
00:13:21,163 --> 00:13:24,113
Oh, it's cool. We did
it in an elevator.

282
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:24,790
(gasps)

283
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:26,934
I'm a Schwarzenegger wife.

284
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:29,869
But you're also the
housekeeper, so it's all good.

285
00:13:29,884 --> 00:13:32,343
It's not good.
None of it's good.

286
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:34,547
I haven't had a
drink for a week.

287
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,180
That is pretty good.

288
00:13:39,202 --> 00:13:43,596
So then you delivered her baby
right there in the elevator.

289
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:47,112
It's true. Even the other guy in
the elevator... he's right here.

290
00:13:47,156 --> 00:13:49,625
And the really funny
thing is I'm a doctor.

291
00:13:51,008 --> 00:13:53,149
Well, I'm glad you
did a good deed,

292
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:55,187
but you shouldn't
come here again.

293
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:57,902
I thought that was strange
poop on your collar.

294
00:13:57,946 --> 00:13:59,171
(moans sadly)

295
00:13:59,301 --> 00:14:02,654
Good-bye, Homer Jr. I guess
you're the man of the house now.

296
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:06,491
And never forget, even though the
mortgage is due on the first,

297
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:09,223
you can usually
wait till the 17th.

You know what?

300
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:18,596
I think it's fine if Homer spends
a few hours now and then with...

301
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:20,530
Homer Jr.

302
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:21,930

330
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,339
Yes, we'll be back by 3:00. Homer
has a very tight nap schedule.

331
00:15:39,357 --> 00:15:41,683
Quit talking about that baby.

332
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:44,144
I was talking about myself
in the third person.

We can't take
much more of this, Lisa.

they'll cheer anything.

Okay, I give up.

349
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:30,839
I wanted you all to be happy together,
so I brought you to the zoo

350
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,232
where all the animals
live in harmony.

351
00:16:36,448 --> 00:16:37,231
(growls)

352
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:38,821
(triumphant wail)

353
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,276
Okay, guys, I got
your ice creams.

354
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,976
Hey, ah, ah, ah.

355
00:16:45,994 --> 00:16:49,242
Now, Maggie, we don't hurt
each other in this family.

356
00:16:49,267 --> 00:16:50,248
Are you nuts?

357
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:53,433
You can't even kiss me good night
without slicing me with your stubble.

358
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,352
Why you little...

359
00:16:54,368 --> 00:16:56,818
I'll give you a good-night
kiss you'll never forget.

360
00:16:57,076 --> 00:16:57,895
Come here, you.

361
00:16:57,906 --> 00:16:59,607
- (grunting)
- Aah, ooh, ah!

362
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,992
- Ah! Ow!
- Yeah!

363
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,259
Dad, we're missing the giant
capybaras of Uruguay.

364
00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:11,480
Okay, I know what'll
cheer you kids up.

365
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,078
Seeing me out-monkey
the monkeys.

366
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:16,890
(hooting like a monkey)

367
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,761
(angry hooting, screeching)

368
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:21,242
I have a soul and
you guys don't.

369
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,230
(hooting)

370
00:17:22,248 --> 00:17:24,307
Aah! Monkeys!

371
00:17:26,593 --> 00:17:27,775
(grunts)

372
00:17:27,818 --> 00:17:29,911
(angry grunt)

373
00:17:34,816 --> 00:17:36,808
Dad, Maggie's rolling away.

374
00:17:36,838 --> 00:17:38,939
(gasps) She's heading for
Prairie Dog Village.

375
00:17:38,962 --> 00:17:42,314
If they get her in their warrens,
we'll never see her again.

376
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:43,991
(chittering)

377
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,483
Look, shiny keys.

378
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:46,547
Jingle jangle.

379
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:47,975
(grunts, laughs)

380
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,465
Stupid monkeys.

381
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,325
That's it, Maggie,
use the Dino-Wand.

382
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:10,269
This is the last time you'll
see that elevator baby.

383
00:18:10,908 --> 00:18:12,928
I'm sorry, Homer Jr.

384
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:19,316
You'll occupy an idealized place in my
heart that no one can ever quite fill.

385
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,662
(Homer sobbing)

386
00:18:21,812 --> 00:18:23,787
- Therapy, please.
- Me, too.

387
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:24,837
(Marge grunts)

388
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:28,449
Okay, I've got to impart all my
fatherly advice in this one walk.

389
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:31,640
The sky is blue, but
nobody really knows why.

390
00:18:31,664 --> 00:18:33,439
Don't believe
what they tell you.

391
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:35,899
Girls are great and terrible
at the same time.

392
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:37,017
Get used to it.

393
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,202
And, most importantly... Oops, we're here.
You'll have to figure it out on your own.

394
00:18:42,974 --> 00:18:45,457
Sorry, little fella.
One day I'll be that guy

395
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:47,941
who comes to your wedding,
makes you feel a little weird,

396
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,322
and then runs away.

397
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:51,954
Homer, great news.
Chase came back.

398
00:18:52,086 --> 00:18:52,886
(whoops)

399
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:55,399
- Who's Chase?
- Homer Jr.'s father.

400
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,256
Oh, my God, is that my son?

401
00:18:58,391 --> 00:19:00,229
You didn't tell me
he was a soldier.

402
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:02,008
You didn't tell <i>me</i>
you were pregnant.

403
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:04,086
I didn't want you to marry
me because I was pregnant.

404
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:06,244
I wanted you to marry me
because I was nagging you.

405
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,784
(fusses)

406
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,594
Um, he likes it if
you tickle his toes.

407
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,410
Dude, he's my kid.
He likes what I like.

408
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,013
But n-n-n-nurture.

409
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:16,285
Gretch, I think
he's got my calves.

410
00:19:16,313 --> 00:19:18,081
He does, baby, he does.

411
00:19:18,102 --> 00:19:20,385
Can I just say
good-bye to him quick?

412
00:19:20,831 --> 00:19:21,495
Sure.

413
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:23,300
I guess this is it, little guy.

414
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:24,584
- Da-da.
- (gasps)

415
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:27,365
The most beautiful
words a father can hear.

416
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,269
- Da-da. Da-da.
- Oh.

417
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:32,661
Hey, one day you'll have
kids of your own.

418
00:19:32,686 --> 00:19:33,571
I do.

419
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:36,344
Really? Then this is much
creepier than I thought.

420
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:37,688
Much.

421
00:19:39,436 --> 00:19:41,592
Shouldn't have bet his door
if he didn't want to lose it.

422
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:42,909
(sighs)

423
00:19:50,766 --> 00:19:55,441
Hi, Maggie. If you could talk, I know
you'd have a few choice words for me.

424
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,887
You want me to take
care of your dolly?

425
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:04,436
That's the sweetest thing any
baby has ever done for me.

426
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,059
Honey, you know where
the bottle opener is?

427
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:20,587
I think it's in the drawer.

428
00:20:22,048 --> 00:20:24,961
Whoa, little dude. Where
did you learn that?

429
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,679
This is what we're
fighting for, babe.

430
00:20:32,715 --> 00:20:33,846
(marching band playing
theme song )

431
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:37,390
HOMER: <i>Hey, what's this marching
band have to do with Homer Jr.?</i>

432
00:20:37,757 --> 00:20:41,709
<i>What?! There were cheerleaders
in our house and nobody told me?</i>

433
00:20:41,832 --> 00:20:43,799
(Homer moans)
