1
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:13,444
RALPH: I see stars!

2
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,255
Bart!

3
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:06,499
D'oh!

4
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,866
O Mardi Gras, O Mardi Gras

5
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,659
You see a lot of boobies

6
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,809
Boy, where are my zydeco records?

7
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,311
There's twelve more boxes
and they all sound the same.

8
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,047
I know they do.
But the Simpson Mardi Gras party...

9
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,916
...has been a tradition since two days
before you were born.

10
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,818
And we spare no expense!

11
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,453
What about my birthday party?

12
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,553
This counts as that.

13
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,224
Ladies, how are you doing with the float?

14
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,559
Fine.
But I wish you'd picked an easier theme...

15
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,695
...than Super Jet Dinosaur Fun Monkeys.

16
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,430
What does that even mean?

17
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,099
Homie, every year this party
gets a little bigger.

18
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,301
I'm afraid it's growing out of hand.

19
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:19,305
Hey, Homer, I have some distant relatives
that I never see except for this party.

20
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,541
Can I bring them to the party?
- No problem.

21
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,444
Just so you know,
some of them act like they hate America.

22
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,413
But what they really hate are Americans.

23
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,717
Marge, lighten up.
Even Grampa's enjoying himself.

24
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:49,769
I officially declare this private party
in some guy's backyard open!

25
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,210
It's my wife! Everyone, pretend this is
a trade seminar in Zurich.

26
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,448
I can't talk now, dear.

27
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,050
It's 4:00 in the morning here in Zurich.

28
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,419
I... Oh, right. We came together.

29
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,619
HOMER: Hey! There you go!

30
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,562
Eat my food! Drink of my drink!

31
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:24,832
Put your coat on my daughter's bed,
I command you!

32
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:29,443
Your majesty, did you remember
to invite Ned Flanders?

33
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:36,340
As the worm said
to the plate of spaghetti, I...

34
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:43,035
Fine. I'll invite him.
But he has to wear the outfit I choose.

35
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,918
Hey, Flanders. Listen,
we're having a party.

36
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,296
I noticed.

37
00:03:51,396 --> 00:03:53,933
So, anyway, if you're not doing anything,

38
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:59,232
and it looks like you are,
you're welcome to stop by or not!

39
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:06,880
Well, Homer, maybe I could use a break
from the old weed and feed.

40
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,382
Man, you really are into me, huh?

41
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,185
What are you? Some kind of talking dog?

42
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,285
Sure.

43
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,757
Three, two, one.

44
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:26,833
It's Ash Wednesday, everybody!
Set down your gins and confess your sins!

45
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,189
Homer, I always wonder,

46
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,724
how can you afford this party
year after year?

47
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:56,196
Because I have this magical thing
called a home equity loan.

48
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,733
I borrow all the money I want
and the house gets stuck with the bill.

49
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,603
Sucker.

50
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,872
I'm not sure that's how it works.

51
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,975
Fine, Mr. Skeptical.
Give me back your beads!

52
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:12,135
But... But... But...
- Beads, please.

53
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:23,256
Homie, do you know anything about this?

54
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:27,193
Marge, don't worry. It's like when
we stopped paying the phone bill.

55
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,796
They stopped calling us.
In fact, everyone did.

56
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,332
I think we should go see our
mortgage broker.

57
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:36,469
Oh, man. Who'd think the first day
of Lent would be such a bummer?

58
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,874
Let's see here. A balloon payment,

59
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,410
37% interest compounded every minute,

60
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,846
not understanding the contract fee

61
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:51,084
And here's your new monthly payment.

62
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,854
That number's so big it has a comma.

63
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,924
Wait. I left out a zero.
- Listen, you!

64
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,425
When you gave me that money,

65
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,995
you said I wouldn't have to repay it
till the future!

66
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,998
This isn't the future!
It's the lousy, stinking now!

67
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,238
Now calm down.

68
00:06:06,338 --> 00:06:10,078
This country takes care
of its middle class.

69
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,541
Now, don't be sore at the banks.

70
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:20,280
Hell, we fired our CEO
and he barely got out with $50 million.

71
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,348
That poor man. Is he okay?

72
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,418
Well, as okay as you can be in
the north of France.

73
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:30,456
Now here's a free tip from me.
Learn to make soup from rocks and grass.

74
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,625
And what will I cook that soup on?

75
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,762
Come on, Marge. You got the sun.
You got hobo fires.

76
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,430
I can't do all the work for you.

77
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,682
I worked so hard to make this house
into a home,

78
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,117
and now somebody else is just
going to take it.

79
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,952
Marge, I'm so sorry.

80
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,388
Why are you here?
You already own a home.

81
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,257
Hey, our au pair has to live somewhere.

82
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,994
This crap shack makes your guest room
look like Winter Palace.

83
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,963
I know. I know. But Bernice wants you out.

84
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,933
Don't worry, honey. We'll come out ahead.

85
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,858
I ripped all the copper wire
out of the walls.

86
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,374
Did you remember to disconnect it first?

87
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,975
Did I what now?

88
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,452
I know I shouldn't get too attached
to a building,

89
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:36,122
but that's where Lisa took her first step.

90
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,124
The kids' height,

91
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,224
Homer's weight.

92
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:48,368
This is so hard because I always thought
Mom was the strong one.

93
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,468
She is. Look.

94
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,209
Goodbye.

95
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:02,448
D'oh!

96
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:05,608
For sale, 742 Evergreen Terrace,

97
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:09,522
detached single-family dwelling.
Now who will start me off?

98
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,258
Anybody ever get murdered in this house?
- No.

99
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,893
Thank you for your time.

100
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,628
$100,000.

101
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,764
Sir, what exactly do you plan
to do with this place?

102
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,133
I need a place to store my cufflinks.

103
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,169
Let's go, kids. I can't watch anymore.

104
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,649
I have $100,000, going once.

105
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,308
Going twice.

106
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,280
$101,000!

107
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:40,553
Pass. I've already lifted this thing
once today. I'm not Hercules.

108
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:44,053
Sold! Okay, folks. Hand in your paddles.

109
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,393
Round ends together, please. Round end...

110
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:50,029
What is this?
Randomly-tossing-your-paddle day?

111
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,689
Ned, you bought our house.

112
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,001
Why?
- So I can rent it back to you.

113
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,336
Just pay what you can
till you get back on your feet.

114
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,517
Ned Flanders,

115
00:08:58,617 --> 00:09:02,396
I can't believe what
you doodily-did for us.

116
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:07,845
Well, as the ocean said to the dirt,
I appreciate the sediment.

117
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:11,849
And on the zillionth day,
God created hugs!

118
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,609
And it was good!

119
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:19,559
Come on, kids.
Let's take our stuff back inside.

120
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:27,502
Better let me go first. I left a little
surprise upstairs for the new owner.

121
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:46,351
For he's a fabulous Flanders

122
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:49,387
Which nobody can deny

123
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,057
He saved our ass

124
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,888
Okay, everyone, squeeze in!

125
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,401
BART: Evil triumphs again.

126
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,004
Ow!

127
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:12,478
Homie, the faucet won't stop leaking.

128
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:16,828
No problem.
Just let Sir Fix-A-Lot slay this chore.

129
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:27,894
Next problem.

130
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,696
Say, Homer, why don't you let me
take a peek at that leak?

131
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,899
Ned, please. You're our guest.

132
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:37,069
Well, actually, as your landlord,
repairs are my responsibility.

133
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,169
I'll just get my tools.

134
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,210
Try her now, Marge.

135
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,714
Hot comes out of hot.

136
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,617
It's like I'm dreaming. Thank you, Ned.

137
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,220
Well, I guess I'd better be...
- Do you have time to look at...

138
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,557
...a few other leaks, faulty wires
and dangerous mold conditions?

139
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,561
Well, as you are my tenants,
I'll see what I can do.

140
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,401
Well, let's see what
else is in the job jar.

141
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:09,521
It's so beautiful. No
two are exactly alike,

142
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:12,766
though many of them are very similar.

143
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,479
I'm back, baby!

144
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:31,490
It's irresistible! You ask him
to do something and he does it.

145
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,825
He's like a genie.

146
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:36,095
When I was putting new insulation
in your attic, I slipped on this lamp,

147
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,997
and really banged my head.

148
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,099
So unless you have anything else for me...

149
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,199
No, no.

150
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:44,537
I'm just happy I can
finally serve this cake.

151
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:52,508
Hello?
- Ned, I think we have a gas leak!

152
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,883
Well, sorry.
I just had my glass of warm milk,

153
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,386
which means I am closed for business.

154
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,755
He won't come over!
- He what?

155
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,791
Flanders, landlords like you
are the scum of the earth!

156
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,595
You lounge around in your Ed McMansions
and we never see you...

157
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:10,997
...unless the rent check's late!

158
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,097
The rent check is late.

159
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,734
Some friend you are!

160
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,870
The minute you become our landlord,
you expect us to pay rent?

161
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,940
You'd better just pray
I don't find out where you live!

162
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,355
Bart! Don't forget to turn the chicken.

163
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,713
People like Flanders make me sick.

164
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,299
If I was Marge's landlord,
I'd fix her pipes...

165
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,184
...and I'd shower her with flowers...

166
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:35,721
...and take her on a romantic
getaway to the South Seas...

167
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,623
...and I'd never return.

168
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,992
Yeah, you'd treat her right.

169
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,161
Well, here's how you get back at Flanders.

170
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,363
You go to the media
and you get them to expose...

171
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,465
...what a horrible person he really is.

172
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,068
Oh, right. Like Dateline did to you.

173
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,302
Yeah, three times.

174
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:53,239
The last one was nominated for a Peabody,
whatever that is.

175
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:58,010
This is Kent Brockman with a Channel 6
exclusive, ''The Evil Ned.''

176
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:02,381
742 Evergreen Terrace,
a tiny slice of suburban heaven.

177
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:05,451
But like dating an actress,
what seemed like heaven...

178
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,551
...soon turned to hell.

179
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,355
HOMER: We live in a house
that is trying to kill us.

180
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,491
Hey, Dad.
- I...

181
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,963
Who is this 'Dad' you speak of,
Lisa Simpson?

182
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,528
You want a cookie, Dad?
- Yes.

183
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,636
Squeaky stair here, scary portrait there.

184
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,946
Poltergeist in the closet.

185
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,387
I died when Homer sat on me.

186
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,178
Why you little...

187
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,146
I'm the victim here!

188
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,117
So who is responsible for these outrages?

189
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:41,187
The man whose side of the story
we didn't even bother to get,

190
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,455
Ned Flanders,

191
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,275
the worst person who ever lived.

192
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,374
Let's see what else is on.

193
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,037
Oh, this is good.

194
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,780
Homer Simpson, I took pity on you,
and what do I get in return?

195
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,882
A kick in the kadiddle hopper!

196
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,083
Kadiddle hopper!

197
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,053
It's not funny. That's how I swear.

198
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,889
Fine. You're mad.
What are you gonna do about it?

199
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,892
When the month is up, I want you out!

200
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:23,629
Fine! I'll get another neighbor
to buy the house and let us live in it.

201
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:24,797
We won't do it!

202
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,199
Your leaving is our Christmas!

203
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:31,871
Flanders, you wouldn't
throw us out on Christmas, would you?

204
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,482
What? Who is that?

205
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,016
It is me, Jesus.

206
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:49,655
I have come from my workshop
in the North Pole to say,

207
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,349
don't evict the Simpsons!

208
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:56,529
Say, Jesus, what was the name
of the son of Zachariah?

209
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:00,759
It was... Do you have a computer nearby?

210
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,273
He's nailing something to our door.

211
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,141
I wonder if it's theses.

212
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,276
That's gross.

213
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,179
Homie, I think it's an eviction notice.

214
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,183
We're gonna be homeless
like Lucille Ball in the Stone Pillow!

215
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,517
Don't worry, Marge.

216
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:22,121
According to this chapter book,
we have a secret weapon.

217
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,291
'Evictee will be granted
a stay of eviction...

218
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:29,428
'if said household includes a resident
aged 65 or over.'

219
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:32,498
Finally, a practical use for my father.

220
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,763
Whee! I'm gonna live like
a human in a real house.

221
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,672
What's the catch?
- I'm using you.

222
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,373
For what?
- My own devices.

223
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,473
All right.

224
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,278
Tell the world what you saw here.

225
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,415
I'm gonna miss putting makeup on him
while he sleeps.

226
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,320
ATTENDANT: I've already moved on.

227
00:15:56,155 --> 00:16:01,727
Hey, Flanders. You can't evict us
because a senior's living here now!

228
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,764
You're never too old
to ruin things for the young.

229
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:18,777
Will you kids knock it off!
I'm trying to watch badminton!

230
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,614
Dad, we've been trapped
in the house for days.

231
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,115
Can't we play outside?

232
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:26,418
Yeah. Without the sun, my hair
is reverting to its natural red.

233
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,088
I don't want to be called Rusty again.
I don't!

234
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,858
You know, it says here
that Grampa has to remain in the house,

235
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,326
but we don't.

236
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,636
How about a family outing?

237
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:39,632
Family outing? I'll start. Lisa's gay!

238
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,334
Right.'Cause I wouldn't want to be gay
like my heroes,

239
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:46,005
Billie Jean King, Susan Sontag,
Sappho of Lesbos...

240
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,207
...and, I suspect, Peppermint Patty.

241
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,342
Well, I guess we could take a quick walk.

242
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:55,014
We'll keep Grampa occupied with this DVD
of Dwight Eisenhower talking about golf.

243
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:58,350
EISENHOWER ON TV: Now, when I've got
a downhill lie, I like to swing wide,

244
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,788
just like Patton did when he swung past
Kesselring's boys in the Ardennes Forest.

245
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,888
Let's watch.

246
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:15,079
This is what I call living in the past.

247
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:25,177
So after I paid for the ice cream cones,
I said thank you and was on my way.

248
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,379
We know, Dad. We were there.

249
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:32,117
I know it seems that way
because I'm such a vivid storyteller.

250
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,687
Now here's another story
called 'Bart's Mistake.'

251
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:35,821
We were walking home when...

252
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,359
How could this have happened?

253
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,328
Because your father lives with me now.

254
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,630
Flanders feeds me people food!

255
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,450
Well, I can't compete with that.

256
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,397
Oh, my God. We're out on the street.

257
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,910
Honey, don't cry. It could be worse.

258
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,220
At least it's not raining.

259
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:07,141
See? I told you it's not raining.
So we're just homeless.

260
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,724
Kids, if you get lost,
remember where we are,

261
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:16,261
75 beds from that wall
and 100 beds from the crazy guy.

262
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,331
CRAZY GUY: Probably the best I've ever
seen although he stole the idea...

263
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,066
...from Amelia Earhart so...

264
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,301
I hate this place!

265
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,437
The clothes they gave us are the clothes
we gave to charity last year.

266
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:28,040
There's a lesson here. Life is fickle.

267
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,710
You should appreciate every...
Stop kicking, Bart!

268
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,779
But kicking is the only toy I have.

269
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:37,182
That's not true.
You have bug bites you can scratch.

270
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,518
This is the lowest we've sunk.

271
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:44,378
CRAZY GUY: That's the answer!
Pawn to king's bishop four!

272
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,693
You two are the kind of tenants
every landlord dreams of.

273
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,562
Excellent credit.
Christian but not Baptist.

274
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,464
And let's see,
according to your application,

275
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,500
you only have sex for procreation.

276
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
If that.

277
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,338
Well, now I'll just put
my John Hancock on the dock...

278
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,907
...and you can give me
the key to the lock.

279
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,009
My ballpoint's all clicked up for you.

280
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,110
No, thanks.

281
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,180
Don't believe in borrowing
things from the neighbor.

282
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,551
Lord, you said love thy neighbor,
but you didn't have to make it so easy.

283
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,354
What you got there, Wolfie Goldberg?

284
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,189
Who's this?

285
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:20,264
That's just a family who used to...

286
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,058
...make my life interesting.

287
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,598
I'll just add my initials there.

288
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:31,362
For he's a fabulous Flanders

289
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,638
There.

290
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,571
Which nobody can deny

291
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,908
And there! Exciting.

292
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,341
Folks...
- And leased!

293
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,086
...I'm afraid you can't live here.

294
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,354
Roger Dodger. Back in the car, Nance.

295
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,256
Yay! But why?

296
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,293
Well, the people who lived here before...

297
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,595
...weren't always the best neighbors,
but I love them.

298
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:00,833
And you can't be a saint
unless you live among the lepers.

299
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:04,236
I hope you don't mind.
- And I hope you won't mind when we sue.

300
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:07,773
I think you should. The court papers
will be a great way to stay in touch.

301
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,975
Well, hasn't this been
a peach of a breach?

302
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,344
We'll see you in court.

303
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:16,815
Flanders, I promise I'll never
abuse our friendship again.

304
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,318
It's okay if you backslide a little.
- Never!

305
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,750
Hooray for stupid Flanders!

306
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,282
The Simpsons are back!

307
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,315
I really hate this neighborhood.

308
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,952
