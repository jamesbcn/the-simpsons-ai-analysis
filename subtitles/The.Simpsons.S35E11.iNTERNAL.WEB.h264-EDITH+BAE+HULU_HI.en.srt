[whirring]

3
00:00:11,082 --> 00:00:12,484
[Willie shouts]

4
00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:24,070
[snoring]

5
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:26,073
[alarm clock buzzes]

6
00:00:26,074 --> 00:00:28,343
Woo-hoo! T.G.I. Monday.

7
00:00:28,344 --> 00:00:32,050
Time to build my future
with the power of work.

8
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,752
[whistles]

9
00:00:33,753 --> 00:00:36,957
Hey, Simpson. They got fresh
donuts in the break room.

10
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:40,564
No time for donuts. I've got to
get to work. Work, work, work.

11
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:42,134
Look at that Homer Simpson.

12
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:44,836
He's the best kind
of holic: worka.

13
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:45,706
[humming]

14
00:00:45,806 --> 00:00:48,844
Hmm. Only two people
ahead of me.

15
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:52,383
I'll be on top in no time.

16
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,558
[snoring]

17
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:58,895
[yawns]

18
00:00:58,995 --> 00:01:00,431
Quitting time!

19
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:03,267
Whoa, whoa, Lazy Joe.
Not for 40 minutes.

20
00:01:03,268 --> 00:01:04,502
[Homer chuckles]

21
00:01:04,503 --> 00:01:06,171
Uh, who do you think
you're fooling?

22
00:01:06,172 --> 00:01:10,312
Sometimes the most important
person to fool is yourself.

23
00:01:10,313 --> 00:01:12,348
Woo-hoo! Overtime!

24
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:13,585
[humming]

25
00:01:13,685 --> 00:01:15,989
Huh? Mm.

26
00:01:17,258 --> 00:01:19,961
[groaning]

27
00:01:19,962 --> 00:01:22,934
What the? I hired that cone.

28
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:24,303
What happened, Moe?

29
00:01:24,403 --> 00:01:26,238
When did I go
from an up-and-comer

30
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,478
to a guy who drinks
other people's beer?

31
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:31,448
Hey, what happened to my beer?

32
00:01:31,548 --> 00:01:33,584
- A leprechaun.
- Again?

33
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:36,422
[sighs] I used to have
ambition, Moe.

34
00:01:36,423 --> 00:01:37,625
What took it away?

35
00:01:37,758 --> 00:01:41,198
Oh, it's a real mystery. Here,
let me pour you another pitcher.

36
00:01:41,298 --> 00:01:42,398
[laughs]

37
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,103
You're a good man, Moe Szyslak.

38
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,872
Just doing God's work.

39
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,609
[laughs]

40
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,245
You know, you start
with huge dreams,

41
00:01:51,246 --> 00:01:52,915
but after 20 years
at that plant,

42
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:55,920
all I've got is a big ball
of rubber bands.

43
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:58,225
For 20 years,
that ball ain't so big.

44
00:01:58,226 --> 00:02:00,195
You start out,
you think you're gonna have

45
00:02:00,295 --> 00:02:01,730
a big ball of rubber bands,

46
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:04,935
then you realize,
you even failed at that.

47
00:02:04,936 --> 00:02:06,804
Oh, that's terribly sad.

48
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:07,774
Mm.

49
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:10,479
Scooching over.
Scooching, scooching...

50
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:12,749
Too far.
I share your disappointment,

51
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:14,417
you see, because by this point,

52
00:02:14,418 --> 00:02:17,457
I thought I'd have won
a prestigious research grant.

53
00:02:17,557 --> 00:02:19,827
I've never even won
in <i>Words with Friends.</i>

54
00:02:19,828 --> 00:02:22,799
I have the words
but not the friends, you see.

55
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:23,867
[Homer]
Wow.

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,204
I never knew smart people
could be unhappy.

57
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:29,777
Oh, my, that's a tear.
I have empathy,

58
00:02:29,877 --> 00:02:33,015
which means that I am,
in fact, human,

59
00:02:33,016 --> 00:02:35,185
as I have long hypothesized.

60
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:37,722
- [phone rings]
- Y'ello.

61
00:02:37,723 --> 00:02:40,827
Homer Simpson? I was wondering
if you'd be interested in a job

62
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,964
at the new nuclear plant
in Shelbyville.

63
00:02:42,965 --> 00:02:47,373
Me? Are you sure you don't want
somebody younger or more Lenny?

64
00:02:47,507 --> 00:02:50,944
No, you. I've never seen
a résumé like this.

65
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:53,649
Technically, several of those
jobs were court-ordered.

66
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,819
Works with law enforcement, great.

67
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,590
Texting you a link
for the interview. It's on Zoom.

68
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:01,461
Woo-hoo! Finally, a use
for this ring light

69
00:03:01,462 --> 00:03:03,731
I've been lugging around.
Could this be it?

70
00:03:03,732 --> 00:03:07,171
The moment my life finally
changes for the better.

71
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:17,622
Oh, Homie.
This never would've happened

72
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:21,193
if you hadn't been sitting
in a bar without your family.

73
00:03:21,194 --> 00:03:22,896
[motor revs]

74
00:03:22,897 --> 00:03:26,836
I'm your self-doubt, and I say
you're gonna screw it up.

75
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:30,175
Well, I'm your ambition,
and I say you're gonna blow it.

76
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,944
- Screw it up.
- Blow it.

77
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:32,946
Screw it up.

78
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:34,483
Blow it.

79
00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:37,088
[deep voice]
No one loves you.

80
00:03:37,188 --> 00:03:39,491
As usual, my imagination
is right.

81
00:03:39,492 --> 00:03:41,094
I'll never get that job.

82
00:03:41,194 --> 00:03:44,866
Sir, I will help you
with the power of science.

83
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:47,504
What does science have to do
with nuclear science?

84
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:48,840
And why you?

85
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,411
Well, as success stories go,
I may not be an EGNOT,

86
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:54,349
but I can certainly help you.

87
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,618
EGNOT? What's that?

88
00:03:55,619 --> 00:03:58,221
That's Emmy, Grammy, Nobel,

89
00:03:58,222 --> 00:04:00,526
Oscar, <i>Time</i> magazine subscriber.

90
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,763
Although, I do have
the easy one, of course.

91
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:04,131
I have an Emmy.

92
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:06,134
Me, too.

93
00:04:06,135 --> 00:04:08,572
I use mine as corn holders.

94
00:04:09,808 --> 00:04:11,711
Marge, baby,
when I get this job,

95
00:04:11,811 --> 00:04:13,547
we're gonna be rich. Rich.

96
00:04:13,647 --> 00:04:16,618
Oh, it's okay, Homie.
We're fine.

97
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:20,358
Are we? I won't have a wife
of mine mending vacuum bags.

98
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:22,696
You'll get new vacuum bags.

99
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:26,434
And someday, maybe,
a new vacuum.

100
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:28,706
[vacuum whirring, clanging]

101
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,844
[yowls]

102
00:04:34,247 --> 00:04:35,650
[Homer]
<i>And... handsome.</i>

103
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:38,655
Hey, Dad, what you doing?

104
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:40,457
Getting ready
for my job interview.

105
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,993
What's Professor Frink
doing here?

106
00:04:41,994 --> 00:04:44,264
Aren't they just
supposed to interview you?

107
00:04:44,265 --> 00:04:47,903
Of course it's just me.
Frink's here for moral support.

108
00:04:47,904 --> 00:04:50,640
Well, why can't I give you
moral support?

109
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:53,579
Because your moral support
always comes with conditions.

110
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,549
I shouldn't drink so much.

111
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,787
I should stay alive
so I can see you graduate.

112
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:00,758
Come on.
Give up those dreams, kid.

113
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,294
- But...
- Give them up.

114
00:05:02,295 --> 00:05:05,064
Okay. [sighs]

115
00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:07,570
[grunting softly]

116
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,707
<i>For 18 months, I led a team</i>

117
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:12,177
<i>at the Large Hadron Collider
in Geneva.</i>

118
00:05:12,277 --> 00:05:13,713
<i>Homer, you're early.</i>

119
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:17,018
<i>I'm still interviewing
another candidate, Dr. Spivak.</i>

120
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:18,186
<i>I-I don't mind.</i>

121
00:05:18,187 --> 00:05:20,257
<i>I look even better
in comparison to other people.</i>

122
00:05:20,357 --> 00:05:24,063
<i>Doctor, let me interview Homer,
and I'll get back to you soon.</i>

123
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:27,969
<i>Very soon. Maybe five seconds.
That kind of soon.</i>

124
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,211
<i>Homer, let's start with what
you know about the N.R.C.</i>

125
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:34,847
[Homer]
<i>N.R.C. N.R.C.</i>

126
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:37,853
[gasps] <i>Those are
the gun nuts, right?</i>

127
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:39,655
[Frink]
<i>Oh, dear. As a fellow human,</i>

128
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:42,360
<i>I want to help him,
but that's unethical.</i>

129
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,364
<i>But I am the kind of nerd</i>

130
00:05:44,464 --> 00:05:47,535
<i>that always must blurt out
the answer.</i>

131
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:50,138
[whispers]
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

132
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:53,444
- <i>Yes.</i> - <i>The Nuclear
Regulatory Commission. Yes.</i>

133
00:05:53,445 --> 00:05:55,249
<i>They're important because...</i>

134
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:56,683
They're the government agency

135
00:05:56,684 --> 00:05:58,921
for nuclear plants
and materials.

136
00:05:59,021 --> 00:06:02,558
Created by executive order
in 1975.

137
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:03,796
Gluhavic.

138
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,063
<i>They're the government agency</i>

00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,800

<i>Gluhavic.</i>

142
00:06:11,141 --> 00:06:12,643
Mm. I didn't know that.

143
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:15,649
Like an iceberg, there's more
to you than meets the eye.

144
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:16,617
And like an iceberg,

145
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,187
you probably won't see me
during the summer.

146
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:22,326
<i>[laughs] Excellent.
I love gentle humor.</i>

147
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:25,330
<i>And that's how a diffraction
grating disperses light</i>

148

<i>into components by wavelength.</i>

00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:30,338
<i>Hoyvin moyvin physics.</i>

150
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:31,541
Homer, I must tell you,

151
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:35,347
this interview, uh, was like
my feet before glycerin cream.

152
00:06:35,348 --> 00:06:38,151
Started rough
but ended quite smooth.

153
00:06:38,152 --> 00:06:41,222
You have the job.
<i>Hyvasti. N ähd ä än pian.</i>

154
00:06:41,223 --> 00:06:42,759
Uh, ditto.

155
00:06:43,762 --> 00:06:47,300
[Spivak grunting angrily]

156
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:51,606
You know that's
my computer, right?

157
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:53,110
[Spivak]
Take it.

158
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:57,517
We did it. Your brains
and my listening

159
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,289
was the perfect combination.
High four.

160
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:02,591
And over I go.

161
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:04,962
I can't believe I got the job.

162
00:07:04,963 --> 00:07:06,698
Well, that's wonderful,
and of course,

163
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:08,835
you will not be needing
my help any longer,

164
00:07:08,836 --> 00:07:10,338
so I wish you the best.

165
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:11,539
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

166
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,910
Look, sir, the deal was

167
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,246
I would help you
get the job. That's it.

168
00:07:15,346 --> 00:07:16,615
I didn't even ask for anything.

169
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:19,286
My quid was woefully
un-pro quo'd.

170
00:07:19,386 --> 00:07:21,924
You can't walk out on me now.
You know the saying:

171
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,360
if you get a man a job,
you feed him for a day.

172
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,566
If you do a man's job,
you feed him for a lifetime.

173
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,837
Now you want me to do
your job for you?

Please.

176
00:07:35,179 --> 00:07:38,350
[sighs] Fine. Fine.
I'll do your job.

177
00:07:38,351 --> 00:07:39,619
I'll do all of it.

No, no, no, no, no, no.
Not all my job.

Like my March Madness bracket,
I'll handle that.

You can't be trusted with
picking Baylor over Gonzaga.

All right, I'll do that, too.

182
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,650
All right, Simpson,
this is the 691st time

183
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,219
you've left us for another job.

Yeah, well, I have
a good feeling about this time.

what the hell, we have a form

for everything else
around here, so why not this?

First, uh, how long do you think
you'll be gone?

everyone here

you to storm out dramatically.

be with you at the new job.

right into your ear,
