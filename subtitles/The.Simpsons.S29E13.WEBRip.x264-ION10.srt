1
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,352
<i>Your face</i>

2
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:13,356
<i>Is like a song</i>

3
00:00:13,392 --> 00:00:15,425
<i>Your sweet eyes whisper</i>

4
00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:18,395
<i>And I want to sing along</i>

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,964
<i>Your features</i>

6
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:25,035
<i>Are in tune</i>

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,636
<i>Let's sing together</i>

8
00:00:26,672 --> 00:00:29,773
<i>And turn every month to June</i>

9
00:00:29,808 --> 00:00:33,243
<i>Your face hums</i>

10
00:00:33,278 --> 00:00:35,946
<i>Makes me a happy fella</i>

11
00:00:35,981 --> 00:00:38,915
<i>No more</i>

12
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:41,718
<i>Singin' a capella</i>

13
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:43,954
<i>No</i>

14
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:47,157
<i>Longer lonely</i>

15
00:00:49,194 --> 00:00:51,928
<i>Lovin' you only</i>

16
00:00:55,434 --> 00:00:58,001
<i>Your lips</i>

17
00:00:58,036 --> 00:01:01,905
<i>With mine will rhyme</i>

18
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,907
<i>And when they touch me</i>

19
00:01:03,942 --> 00:01:06,943
<i>It's a symphony divine</i>

20
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:09,246
<i>Your cheeks</i>

21
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:13,416
<i>Your ears, your hair</i>

22
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:15,352
<i>Weave me a melody</i>

23
00:01:15,387 --> 00:01:18,622
<i>A melody so rare</i>

24
00:01:18,657 --> 00:01:22,092
<i>Your face hums</i>

25
00:01:22,127 --> 00:01:24,528
<i>Makes me a happy fella</i>

26
00:01:24,563 --> 00:01:27,697
<i>No more</i>

27
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:30,433
<i>Singin' a capella</i>

28
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:32,435
<i>No</i>

29
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:35,872
<i>Longer lonely</i>

30
00:01:37,743 --> 00:01:42,145
<i>Lovin' you only</i>

31
00:01:58,363 --> 00:02:00,297
Okay, movie's over.

32
00:02:00,332 --> 00:02:02,399
The superheroes are friends
again. Let's get out of here.

33
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:04,968
We can't leave before the
post-credits sequence.

34
00:02:05,003 --> 00:02:08,905
Why does Jeremy Renner
need two assistants?

35
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,308
Here comes the sequence.

36
00:02:11,343 --> 00:02:14,211
The Avengers were too
strong for us, my Lord.

37
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:20,517
What? Who's that?

38
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:22,485
That's Spider-Man's
Uncle Ben.

39
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:25,188
He was alive the whole time.

40
00:02:25,224 --> 00:02:26,656
And evil.

41
00:02:26,692 --> 00:02:30,560
With great power, comes
no responsibility.

42
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,931
Finally.

43
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:36,666
What? You saw it.

44
00:02:36,702 --> 00:02:39,903
That was a mid-credit scene.
There's more.

45
00:02:42,407 --> 00:02:43,773
Who the hell are you?

46
00:02:43,809 --> 00:02:45,442
I'm assembling
a team of the best

47
00:02:45,477 --> 00:02:47,110
team assemblers
in the world.

48
00:02:47,145 --> 00:02:51,281
And I want you to help me
put together that team.

49
00:02:51,316 --> 00:02:53,817
Assemblers assemble!

50
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,125
Time to go.

51
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,894
But there's two more
credit sequences.

52
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:06,096
When I was a kid, movies
ended when they ended.

53
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:07,931
The only reason you
stayed for the credits

54
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,866
was to see who sang
The Power of Love.

55
00:03:09,902 --> 00:03:11,935
And it was usually Huey Lewis.

56
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,137
I liked the first post-credit
sequence the best.

57
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:15,805
I liked the fifth.

58
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:17,407
Pipe down.
I'm trying to listen

59
00:03:17,442 --> 00:03:19,409
to preseason minor
league baseball.

60
00:03:19,444 --> 00:03:20,977
And with the last

61
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:22,479
of the Isotopes pitchers

62
00:03:22,514 --> 00:03:25,415
receiving Tommy John
surgery on the mound,

63
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,584
that's the ball game.
Good night, everybody.

64
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:32,188
Stupid baseball traffic.

65
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,190
I'm taking a shortcut home.

66
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:41,097
Kids, look. We used to live
here before we were married.

67
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:43,300
It's the old
Beef Rendering District.

68
00:03:43,335 --> 00:03:45,835
Yes, Tallow-town.

69
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:47,370
At the end of every
factory tour,

70
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:49,539
they gave you a free
glass of blood.

71
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:52,008
It's really gentrified.

72
00:03:52,044 --> 00:03:54,778
Oh, a store where
you grind and flavor

73
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:57,013
your own house made
toothpaste.

74
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:01,651
Terrible.

75
00:04:01,687 --> 00:04:04,120
There's our old building.
Look.

76
00:04:06,058 --> 00:04:08,758
Our fifth floor
walk-up apartment.

77
00:04:08,794 --> 00:04:12,862
Dad, you walked up
five floors every day?

78
00:04:12,898 --> 00:04:14,597
No.
I took the elevator

79
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:16,232
to the top of the building
next door,

80
00:04:16,268 --> 00:04:18,501
then crawled across
a plank to our roof.

81
00:04:18,537 --> 00:04:21,204
Hey!
I pioneered that trail!

82
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:23,373
Yeah, great.
Thank you, Kit Carson.

83
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:25,976
Kids, you want to check
out our old apartment?

84
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:30,914
I can tell from your tone
that we're going either way.

85
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:32,849
I have one tone.

86
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:38,254
Hi. You don't know me,
but I'm Marge Simpson.

87
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,557
Oh, yeah,
I recognize that name.

88
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:42,459
In fact, we still
get mail for you.

89
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,566
Oh, thank God.

90
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:52,869
A list of 101
new choking hazards.

91
00:04:52,904 --> 00:04:55,705
Pacifiers?

92
00:05:00,112 --> 00:05:02,178
No! No.

93
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:04,214
Maggie!

94
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:05,715
Oh, here.

95
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:06,916
So can I get you anything?

96
00:05:06,952 --> 00:05:08,251
Weed? Edibles?

97
00:05:08,286 --> 00:05:09,819
Pudding with a joint
in the center?

98
00:05:09,855 --> 00:05:11,254
But we need you out
by 7:00.

99
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:13,089
We Airbnb this place
every night

100
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,025
while we stay at
a cheaper Airbnb.

101
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,260
Disruptive.

102
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:21,398
Before Homer and I got married,
we had amazing times here.

103
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:23,099
Yeah, right.

104
00:05:23,135 --> 00:05:25,435
Like you could possibly
ever have fun without us.

105
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,270
It was a wonderful time.

106
00:05:27,305 --> 00:05:29,873
- We were living the DINK life.
- Dink?

107
00:05:29,908 --> 00:05:33,309
- DINK, Dual Income, No Kids.
- Oh, DINK.

108
00:05:33,345 --> 00:05:35,612
How come you can say dink when
you're talking about your jobs,

109
00:05:35,647 --> 00:05:38,882
but I can't say dink when
I'm talking about my dingus.

110
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:41,217
Before we had you,
life was a breeze.

111
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:43,053
We'd go to amusement parks
without going

112
00:05:43,088 --> 00:05:44,888
on those stupid baby rides.

113
00:05:44,923 --> 00:05:47,223
Squeezing my butt
into a little biplane

114
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:49,225
that only goes four feet
off the ground.

115
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:52,662
Actually, Dad, it's supposed
to go 12 feet off the ground.

116
00:05:52,697 --> 00:05:55,231
- D'oh!
- It was a great life.

117
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:56,900
We were swimming in DINKs.

118
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:01,905
See? That was the key to
their happiness... no kids.

119
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,640
We've been talking about
starting a family,

120
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:05,408
but we're just not sure
we're ready.

121
00:06:05,444 --> 00:06:07,977
We can't even agree on
what to name our ferret.

122
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:09,679
Yeah, we both like Caitlin,

123
00:06:09,714 --> 00:06:12,248
but we just, we can't
agree on the spelling.

124
00:06:14,386 --> 00:06:16,920
Well, we used to be
just like you.

125
00:06:16,955 --> 00:06:20,156
Childless and partying
every night.

126
00:06:29,134 --> 00:06:33,369
Hey, check out who crashed
the party, Kent Brockman.

127
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:37,874
Ooh, he does the animal adoption
segment on Thursday mornings.

128
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:41,478
Yes, the biggest problem
with winning

129
00:06:41,513 --> 00:06:43,313
a local Humane Society
Golden Pig Ear

130
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:45,815
is just staying humble.

131
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:47,951
This celebrity sighting
will be the lead

132
00:06:47,986 --> 00:06:50,954
for my gossip column,
Marge Madness.

133
00:06:51,989 --> 00:06:53,690
What are you doing?

134
00:06:53,725 --> 00:06:55,558
There isn't even a dartboard.

135
00:06:55,594 --> 00:06:56,860
You're Marge Bouvier?

136
00:06:56,895 --> 00:06:58,495
Oh, I read your listings
every week...

137
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,197
correct dates, very few typos,
professional stuff.

138
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:05,068
Just steer clear of pet shelters
and fun runs, those are my beat.

139
00:07:05,103 --> 00:07:07,537
Mr. Brockman,
you're hurting my arm.

140
00:07:07,572 --> 00:07:09,172
Oh, I'm sorry.

141
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:12,208
I just care about
soft news so much.

142
00:07:12,244 --> 00:07:14,744
I had a job at a cutting
edge new company

143
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:16,412
that would change the world.

144
00:07:16,448 --> 00:07:19,015
Homer, next week we finally
take our revolutionary

145
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,650
teeth whitening strips
to market.

146
00:07:20,685 --> 00:07:22,085
I couldn't have done it
without you, man.

147
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,220
Together,
we make an amazing team.

148
00:07:24,256 --> 00:07:26,856
Me, with my advanced degrees
in medicine, chemistry

149
00:07:26,892 --> 00:07:29,859
and business, and you, with
your gentle good humor.

150
00:07:29,895 --> 00:07:31,661
I hear that.

151
00:07:31,696 --> 00:07:33,096
I love it.

152
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:34,564
It's like I know you're
not listening to me,

153
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:35,865
but I'm not mad at you.

154
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:37,433
- I'm sorry, what?
- Exactly.

155
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:39,869
Buddy, whatever I make,
you get a piece of.

156
00:07:39,905 --> 00:07:42,939
I hear that.
I mean, I really hear that.

157
00:07:44,943 --> 00:07:48,278
Homer took me to the
hippest spots in town.

158
00:08:02,661 --> 00:08:04,260
Oh, Homie.

159
00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:07,697
This is the happiest I've
ever been in my life.

160
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:09,199
Hold onto it, Marge.

161
00:08:09,234 --> 00:08:11,034
Hold on and never let go.

162
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:13,069
- The moment?
- No, the rail!

163
00:08:30,388 --> 00:08:33,489
Oh, quit resting.

164
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:36,426
We'd see classic movies
whenever we wanted.

165
00:09:11,563 --> 00:09:13,963
Hey, some of us are trying
to enjoy the movie.

166
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:15,531
No, none of us are.

167
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,970
At least I died
before I'm 30!

168
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:25,508
Yes, he was 47
when he made this film.

169
00:09:27,145 --> 00:09:28,611
Did you two
lovebirds-a know

170
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:30,380
there's a meteor
shower tonight?

171
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:33,516
Homie. We should drive
to the desert and watch it.

172
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:36,953
What about the kids?
Oh, right, we have none.

173
00:09:45,697 --> 00:09:47,730
So why can't you do stuff
like that now?

174
00:09:47,766 --> 00:09:49,065
Why do you think?

175
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,000
It couldn't be me,
Booze 'n' Snooze.

176
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:52,568
Why you little...

177
00:09:53,604 --> 00:09:55,305
Marge!

178
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,074
Pick up the narrative!

179
00:09:58,109 --> 00:10:01,210
We were having
the time of our lives.

180
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:12,801
And then it came.

181
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:15,091
Have some num-num.

182
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:16,526
Who likes num-num?

183
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:17,894
You like num-num?

184
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:20,863
Oh, there's a meteor
shower tonight.

185
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:22,265
We'll do the next one.

186
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,001
It's in 187 years.

187
00:10:25,036 --> 00:10:27,236
Where are they coming from,
outer space?

188
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:28,604
Have some num-num.

189
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,381
Who likes num-num?
You like num-num?

190
00:10:33,914 --> 00:10:36,912
Where did this beautiful
man go?

191
00:10:36,947 --> 00:10:38,180
Dad,

192
00:10:38,215 --> 00:10:40,349
I know it was fun
to be young and free,

193
00:10:40,384 --> 00:10:43,385
but how could you
ever replace us?

194
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,355
Pool table, jukebox, and
a vacation to Bermuda.

195
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,157
Dad! Can you please
get to the part

196
00:10:48,192 --> 00:10:51,026
where you reassure us how
glad you are we're here?

197
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:53,562
Hey, as long as I'm the
pool table, I'm cool.

198
00:10:53,597 --> 00:10:55,097
Sweetie, I treasure you.

199
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:56,365
But before you kids,

200
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,867
I used to know the names
of people in bands!

201
00:10:58,903 --> 00:11:01,570
And not just the singer,
but the guitar guy!

202
00:11:01,605 --> 00:11:06,074
And baby Bart was the worst son
of a bitch you could imagine.

203
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,844
We were the first of
our friends to have a baby,

204
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,879
so we got lots of attention.

205
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:15,851
Hey, little man. Up high.

206
00:11:15,886 --> 00:11:17,586
Down low. Too slow.

207
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:22,691
Again!

208
00:11:22,726 --> 00:11:24,793
All right. Up high.

209
00:11:27,163 --> 00:11:28,297
What was that?!

210
00:11:28,332 --> 00:11:30,265
Oh, that's tangelo!
Come on!

211
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:33,302
That's the most acidic
of all the citrus fruits!

212
00:11:33,337 --> 00:11:36,471
I see now that even
babies don't respect you.

213
00:11:36,507 --> 00:11:39,942
Were you planning on bringing
this brat to board game night?

214
00:11:39,977 --> 00:11:41,310
Oh, sea salt!

215
00:11:41,345 --> 00:11:43,512
The biggest crystals of all!

216
00:11:44,548 --> 00:11:46,048
We don't have a sitter.

217
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,916
Invitation rescinded!

218
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:50,619
Next, baby Bart ruined
my one shot at success,

219
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:53,322
my only fast pass
to cash mountain.

220
00:11:53,357 --> 00:11:54,990
Yes, thank you.
You won't be sorry.

221
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:56,325
We're goin' places, Homer.

222
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,060
Soon you'll be in
a higher tax bracket.

223
00:11:58,095 --> 00:12:00,000
D'oh!

224
00:12:00,764 --> 00:12:02,898
What's that thing
on your shoulder?

225
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:04,633
My son.

226
00:12:04,668 --> 00:12:06,101
You can't have a kid.

227
00:12:06,136 --> 00:12:08,537
But I have a kid.

228
00:12:08,572 --> 00:12:11,073
A kid indicates you took time
away from me to conceive.

229
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:12,875
It's like a virus.
It starts spreading,

230
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,843
and suddenly everyone's
getting married

231
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:15,978
when they should be working.

232
00:12:16,013 --> 00:12:17,446
Working. Always working.

233
00:12:18,682 --> 00:12:20,782
I have a difficult
choice here.

234
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:23,819
You chose me over money?

235
00:12:23,854 --> 00:12:26,355
I deserved that.

236
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,690
And that.
Now he's worth $10 billion.

237
00:12:28,726 --> 00:12:31,260
I still have his phone number,
but I've never called it.

238
00:12:31,295 --> 00:12:32,361
Well, why not?

239
00:12:32,396 --> 00:12:33,495
He loved you before.

240
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,030
You're the same guy.

241
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:36,131
Yeah!

242
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:38,600
Homer Simpson?

243
00:12:38,636 --> 00:12:40,135
Buddy, is that you?

244
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,504
I've been expecting
this call for years.

245
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:44,039
You remember me?

246
00:12:44,074 --> 00:12:46,808
Of course. I've been waiting
to say something to you.

247
00:12:46,844 --> 00:12:47,943
Are you ready?

248
00:12:47,978 --> 00:12:49,311
I sure am.

249
00:12:49,346 --> 00:12:54,283
Good-bye forever.

250
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,624
Closure is supposed to be
a good thing.

251
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,962
Also, I'm afraid, a newborn and
a journalism career did not mix.

252
00:13:06,997 --> 00:13:09,665
This is terrible! I wanted
quotes from the swing set,

253
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,199
not price quotes
on swing sets.

254
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:14,336
Party pics, not potty tips.

255
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:16,138
Glitterati, not babysitterati.

256
00:13:16,173 --> 00:13:18,240
Are you getting my drift
or should I throw you an oar?

257
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:21,376
It's important for new
parents to know this stuff.

258
00:13:21,412 --> 00:13:22,178
New parents?

259
00:13:22,413 --> 00:13:24,012
They're not the audience
for the Leisure Section.

260
00:13:24,048 --> 00:13:25,347
All they care about are babies.

261
00:13:25,382 --> 00:13:27,149
Babies are boring.
I'd rather talk about soccer.

262
00:13:27,184 --> 00:13:28,184
And I hate soccer!

263
00:13:28,185 --> 00:13:29,751
Marge, do you like bacon?

264
00:13:29,787 --> 00:13:30,986
Yes, ac...

265
00:13:31,021 --> 00:13:32,554
Well, you got one last
chance to save yours.

266
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:34,356
Get me a good nightlife
story, or I'm replacing you

267
00:13:34,391 --> 00:13:36,992
with someone with a nightlife,
Barbara Rellalinsky!

268
00:13:37,027 --> 00:13:39,528
I will get the scoop.

269
00:13:39,563 --> 00:13:44,199
So, you've moved into
painting giant schnozzes.

270
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:46,668
Marge, the mouth has
had its say.

271
00:13:46,704 --> 00:13:50,005
Now it's time to find out
what the nose knows.

272
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,507
That's a pull-quote,
if ever I heard one.

273
00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:55,043
Pretty much everything
I say is quotable.

274
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,179
Well, not that.

275
00:13:58,515 --> 00:14:00,148
What are you doing here?

276
00:14:00,184 --> 00:14:01,683
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

277
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:03,218
I know it's my night
to watch Bart,

278
00:14:03,253 --> 00:14:04,920
but he just won't
stop fussing.

279
00:14:04,955 --> 00:14:07,723
Did you try driving around
to make him fall asleep?

280
00:14:07,758 --> 00:14:09,491
It only worked on me.

281
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:18,100
Next stop,
Somali Pirate Island.

282
00:14:18,135 --> 00:14:19,201
D'oh!

283
00:14:22,773 --> 00:14:25,107
Bunny!

284
00:14:35,652 --> 00:14:37,619
It's not art anymore!

285
00:14:37,654 --> 00:14:40,155
It's a misshapen lump
on the floor!

286
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,824
Not like this masterpiece!

287
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,262
Marge,
this photo is dynamite!

288
00:14:47,297 --> 00:14:48,331
Thank you!

289
00:14:48,332 --> 00:14:49,631
Dynamite kills people!

290
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,100
Thanks to your kid, we just
lost all our art advertising,

291
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:54,302
the art gallery and Art's Deli,
which catered the event.

292
00:14:54,338 --> 00:14:56,304
You're fired! Turn in your
press card and your fedora!

293
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,106
And I'm gonna erase your name
from this birthday card

294
00:14:58,142 --> 00:15:00,042
we got for Doris.

295
00:15:00,077 --> 00:15:02,411
See? It's gone! She won't
miss it. She never liked you.

296
00:15:02,446 --> 00:15:04,613
But I still had the
greatest job in the world,

297
00:15:04,648 --> 00:15:07,049
I thought, being a mom.

298
00:15:11,822 --> 00:15:13,155
Boy, if it wasn't for naptime,

299
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,824
we'd have all been dead
from the stress years ago.

300
00:15:21,131 --> 00:15:23,999
I didn't do it.

301
00:15:24,034 --> 00:15:26,668
You are banned forever
from Gymdandee,

302
00:15:26,703 --> 00:15:29,471
our sister shops Swimdandee
and Violindandee.

303
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:31,673
And all other Kid Kennel
enrichment centers

304
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:32,841
and baby prisons.

305
00:15:34,645 --> 00:15:36,344
Hey, Homer.

306
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,013
Haven't seen you
in a while.

307
00:15:38,048 --> 00:15:39,514
I switched to donuts.

308
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:42,717
Our dream life crumbling,

309
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:45,520
Homie and I sought
counseling at the church.

310
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:50,292
You were so very wise to
bring your problems here.

311
00:15:50,327 --> 00:15:52,294
Now, won't you bow
your heads

312
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:54,362
and watch this video.

313
00:16:00,337 --> 00:16:03,105
Hello.
I'm Professor Thernstrom,

314
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,042
author of Fractured Families
and How to Heal Them.

315
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:10,545
I think we all know who
Professor Thernstrom is.

316
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:12,447
Play the video.

317
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:14,382
Jane was an only child.

318
00:16:14,418 --> 00:16:16,718
And science has proven
that only children

319
00:16:16,753 --> 00:16:18,186
are lonely children

320
00:16:18,222 --> 00:16:21,289
and lonely children
are evil children.

321
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:29,397
Jane's problems became
the family's problems.

322
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:37,906
They came to see me,
and, nine months later,

323
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:40,175
Joe was born,
and all was well.

324
00:16:54,558 --> 00:16:55,790
That's it, Homie!

325
00:16:55,826 --> 00:16:57,192
That's the answer!

326
00:16:57,227 --> 00:16:59,194
We're having another child.

327
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:00,462
But just the one.

328
00:17:00,497 --> 00:17:02,097
We're not Catholics.

329
00:17:02,132 --> 00:17:04,633
And so we decided
to have Lisa.

330
00:17:04,668 --> 00:17:06,301
That's what this
was building to?

331
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:08,970
I thought this was the story
of how we got our furnace.

332
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:11,506
Who would care
how we got the furnace?

333
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:12,542
I would care.

334
00:17:12,543 --> 00:17:13,842
It came with the house.

335
00:17:13,877 --> 00:17:15,744
Mystery solved!

336
00:17:25,283 --> 00:17:27,250
Finally, he's asleep.
Let's make another.

337
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:29,252
No. Oh, not here.

338
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:32,122
He might wake up. The only safe
place is out on the fire escape.

339
00:17:32,157 --> 00:17:33,723
What if firemen need it?

340
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:35,725
I'll be quick.

341
00:17:36,828 --> 00:17:40,363
Now Mother Nature
does the rest.

342
00:17:46,571 --> 00:17:49,139
Duh, girls don't like me.

343
00:17:57,149 --> 00:17:58,248
Hey! No fair!

344
00:17:58,283 --> 00:18:00,250
Hey, where did he get
those glasses?

345
00:18:00,285 --> 00:18:02,819
The saxophone makes sense,
but the glasses don't?

346
00:18:02,854 --> 00:18:04,354
Shut up, you!

347
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:06,356
Shut up!

348
00:18:10,028 --> 00:18:14,393
And so after a lot of late-night
ice cream and pickles,

349
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:15,732
Lisa was born.

350
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:17,200
And the best part was

351
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:20,403
Bart became the calmest
boy in the whole world.

352
00:18:20,438 --> 00:18:21,871
More or less.

353
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:23,206
Why, you...

354
00:18:23,241 --> 00:18:26,676
You delightful
little blessing.

355
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,648
Someone's gonna need
four months of rehab.

356
00:18:31,683 --> 00:18:33,583
Not covered by insurance.

357
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,254
So a family with kids is
a different kind of happy,

358
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,923
but still happy.

359
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,525
Wow, just... wow.

360
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:43,927
Hey, where's your wife?

361
00:18:43,962 --> 00:18:46,262
She left me forever
during your story.

362
00:18:46,298 --> 00:18:48,531
If you look out the window,
you can probably see her.

363
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:51,467
Why did you leave?!

364
00:18:51,503 --> 00:18:54,137
Because I never want to be
stuck with people like you

365
00:18:54,172 --> 00:18:57,841
who stunt each other's growth
with your rampant dysfunction!

366
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,744
Quick. Family smile.

367
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,246
Our lives are great!

368
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:06,850
We left out the happy parts
because they were boring!

369
00:19:06,918 --> 00:19:09,219
Nothing wrong
with this picture.

370
00:19:13,758 --> 00:19:14,891
Get over here, Lisa.

371
00:19:14,926 --> 00:19:16,392
The only way
humanity survives

372
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:19,796
is if people perpetuate
this lie.

373
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:21,264
Well, why is she frowning?

374
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,399
Is there some unhappiness
you're hiding?

375
00:19:24,936 --> 00:19:27,804
I'm gonna stake my whole
marriage on what you do next!

376
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,772
Smile. Don't be a dink.

377
00:19:33,245 --> 00:19:35,812
I love you, Miles!

378
00:19:39,618 --> 00:19:40,917
You did it, sweetie.

379
00:19:40,952 --> 00:19:42,785
You saved two bad marriages.

380
00:19:42,821 --> 00:19:45,121
What's the first bad marriage?

381
00:19:45,156 --> 00:19:46,389
I miscounted.

382
00:19:46,424 --> 00:19:48,224
You saved one bad marriage.
Just one.

383
00:19:49,328 --> 00:19:51,862
Reminds me of the first
time we hugged.

384
00:19:51,863 --> 00:19:52,897
Great story.

385
00:19:52,898 --> 00:19:54,230
Get out.

386
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:56,399
Well, we may not be ethical,

387
00:19:56,434 --> 00:19:58,134
but we're a great team.

388
00:19:58,169 --> 00:20:00,470
Just like Fred and Ethical.

389
00:20:00,505 --> 00:20:02,005
Want to tell us
how Maggie was born?

390
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,473
We told you that story.

391
00:20:03,508 --> 00:20:05,808
- And how we got the dog?
- Found him at Christmas.

392
00:20:05,844 --> 00:20:08,677
- And the origin of the cat?
- Nobody cares.

393
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:13,087
This was a nice idea, Homie.

394
00:20:13,317 --> 00:20:14,817
I'm glad we came back here.

395
00:20:14,852 --> 00:20:16,085
Just the two of us.

396
00:20:18,622 --> 00:20:20,522
Just imagine what they'd do

397
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:22,591
if Grampa wasn't
watching them.

398
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:24,860
I wish I'd never had kids.

399
00:20:24,895 --> 00:20:27,863
Thank God there's no munitions
left in the factory.

400
00:20:27,898 --> 00:20:29,198
Never too late for another!

401
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:31,467
No one's made it out
in a half century!

402
00:20:31,502 --> 00:20:33,502
I didn't even know
there were five of us!

403
00:20:39,043 --> 00:20:40,476
Make room! What the...?

404
00:20:40,511 --> 00:20:42,144
How did you get in here?

405
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:43,779
Mind your own business.
