1
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:30,099
D'oh!

2
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:50,887
Dad, we're four episodes early.

3
00:00:50,922 --> 00:00:52,055
D'oh!

4
00:00:58,797 --> 00:01:01,998
Here it is, Myra...
the key to the trophy case.

5
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:03,766
If we'd ever won a trophy,

6
00:01:03,802 --> 00:01:05,435
I would've turned
the heck out of it.

7
00:01:06,504 --> 00:01:08,838
I can't believe
you're retiring, sir.

8
00:01:10,308 --> 00:01:13,843
Martin, I must ask you to keep
secret what you just heard...

9
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:16,112
the shocking news
that I'm retiring.

10
00:01:16,147 --> 00:01:19,182
Sir, you are addressing
a student safety monitor.

11
00:01:19,217 --> 00:01:22,819
With diagonal belt comes
great responsibility.

12
00:01:22,854 --> 00:01:25,555
I've got a secret! Firsties!

13
00:01:33,832 --> 00:01:35,398
What?!

14
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:37,700
Skinner's quitting!
I won the pool!

15
00:01:37,736 --> 00:01:40,303
Guess who's renting two
songs from iTunes!

16
00:01:40,338 --> 00:01:42,372
Skinner's retiring!
Bombardment!

17
00:01:42,407 --> 00:01:44,073
He will be missed!
Bombardment!

18
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:46,709
He stood up for me when they
tried to ban bombardment!

19
00:01:46,745 --> 00:01:48,077
Bombardment!

20
00:01:49,414 --> 00:01:51,381
My fellow Americans,
and Uter...

21
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:52,882
the rumors are true.

22
00:01:52,918 --> 00:01:54,450
I'm resigning the principality

23
00:01:54,486 --> 00:01:56,152
effective Taco Tuesday.

24
00:01:57,422 --> 00:01:59,622
Seymour, you will be missed.

25
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,529
And now, the flyover by
the Permission Slip Angels.

26
00:02:09,034 --> 00:02:11,768
My distance-vision eye.

27
00:02:11,803 --> 00:02:14,704
Skinner leaving. One last
chance to honor him...

28
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:16,973
with a shot to the head.

29
00:02:22,846 --> 00:02:24,414
Move it.

30
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:27,116
Come on, Bart! Take the shot!

31
00:02:27,152 --> 00:02:29,185
I don't have the damn shot!

32
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,554
Now, in honor of our
principal's retirement,

33
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:33,890
we'll have a performance
from a super talent

34
00:02:33,925 --> 00:02:36,225
who's gonna wrap up
our feelings.

35
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:38,394
<i>I can't believe
this is good-bye</i>

36
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,663
<i>You were like a mommy
who wears a tie</i>

37
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:43,099
<i>You once called men
who put me in a net</i>

38
00:02:43,134 --> 00:02:45,368
<i>You always told me
when I was wet</i>

39
00:02:45,403 --> 00:02:48,204
<i>They said I had to wait
two years to do karate</i>

40
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,307
<i>Even though my friend who is
the same age is in the class</i>

41
00:02:51,343 --> 00:02:52,710
<i>Karate!</i>

42
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,310
There's a certain
lack of elegance

43
00:02:54,346 --> 00:02:55,812
in rhyming karate
with karate.

44
00:02:55,847 --> 00:02:57,046
Karate!

45
00:02:57,082 --> 00:02:58,614
Now, I'll share a fond farewell

46
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,617
with one student chosen at
random to represent you all.

47
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:05,374
Bart Simpson.

48
00:03:05,374 --> 00:03:08,791
There is a God, and his
name is the Devil.

49
00:03:08,827 --> 00:03:11,866
Bart, come forward.

50
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,398
In the words of the late
David Bowie, nÃ© Jones.

51
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:17,066
Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes.

53
00:03:19,537 --> 00:03:21,304
Gotcha!

54
00:03:23,608 --> 00:03:25,074
No. Got you!

55
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,542
Now, Willie! The honey!

56
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:38,788
Simpson, I'm not retiring.

57
00:03:38,823 --> 00:03:41,324
This was all
just a prank on you.

58
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:45,028
Leave him alone!

59
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:51,768
Where do I go?
How do I live this down?

60
00:03:51,803 --> 00:03:55,038
Mom, my humiliation
bath is getting cold.

61
00:03:55,073 --> 00:03:57,840
Hold still. You've got
honey in your pits.

62
00:04:00,644 --> 00:04:01,677
Sticky.

63
00:04:02,914 --> 00:04:05,048
Bombardment!

64
00:04:07,152 --> 00:04:09,285
Oh, Nelsoned by Largo.

65
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,721
I'll get them back.
I'll get them all back.

66
00:04:11,756 --> 00:04:14,190
And that'll be
the end of it forever.

67
00:04:14,225 --> 00:04:17,060
Not good enough!

68
00:04:19,864 --> 00:04:22,498
What are you gonna do, Bart?
Wait, wait, wait. Don't tell me.

69
00:04:22,534 --> 00:04:24,067
I'll have nightmares,

70
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:26,865
like the one where I'm wearing
my pajamas during the daytime.

71
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:28,671
You are wearing your pajamas.

72
00:04:28,706 --> 00:04:31,474
Some day I want to be
a racecar driver.

73
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:33,709
Do you know
how many get killed?

74
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:37,113
They don't show
that on the pajamas!

75
00:04:57,735 --> 00:05:00,075
Pranking Bart was
my Sergeant Peppers,

76
00:05:00,107 --> 00:05:02,346
after a lifetime of
Back Off Boogaloos.

77
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:05,041
What the...? Simpson!

78
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,446
My skin!

79
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,287
Hey, Brandine.

80
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:21,724
These woods is filled
with scary white people.

81
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,126
What else is new?

82
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:24,460
Bait the traps.

83
00:05:24,496 --> 00:05:26,808
Mama needs
a new people coat.

84
00:05:27,132 --> 00:05:29,732
Thanks to one vengeful
prankster, clowns...

85
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:32,802
once a source of delight...
have now become more twisted

86
00:05:32,837 --> 00:05:36,239
than the balloon animals they
wrap their creepy hands around.

87
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:38,541
We only hope
that by showing it on TV,

88
00:05:38,576 --> 00:05:40,109
no one goes out
and copies it.

89
00:05:40,145 --> 00:05:41,811
Now, let's tell you
how it's done.

90
00:05:41,846 --> 00:05:43,412
Send your copycat videos

91
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:47,316
to Kent's Krazy Klown
Karnival of Kartoon Karnage.

92
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:09,939
Upside down and inside out,
and you can feel it...

93
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:20,249
Oh, no. No. Now people have
to judge us by our music.

94
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:21,651
We're doomed.

95
00:06:21,686 --> 00:06:23,452
20 seconds to air.

96
00:06:23,488 --> 00:06:26,088
How many times have
I told you not to wake me

97
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:27,957
till it's two seconds to air?

98
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:29,145
Krusty, I have to warn you.

99
00:06:29,145 --> 00:06:32,128
People's attitudes
have changed about...

100
00:06:32,163 --> 00:06:34,797
Hey-hey, kids!

101
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:38,267
Calm down, children.
I'm here.

102
00:06:38,303 --> 00:06:41,037
The shirtless man with
the bone through his skull

103
00:06:41,072 --> 00:06:44,607
and a grass skirt with
nothing down under.

104
00:06:46,878 --> 00:06:49,045
I tried to warn you.

105
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,680
People hate clowns now.

106
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:52,615
And the advertisers
want to meet with you.

107
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,999
What is it with Bart
and these pranks?

108
00:07:02,034 --> 00:07:03,801
- I don't get it.
- I don't know.

109
00:07:03,836 --> 00:07:05,235
Boys will be boys.

110
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:06,770
That's another thing I don't get.

111
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:08,973
What does that mean?
Spoons will be spoons.

112
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:11,075
But they don't make you
go to juvenile court

113
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,643
at 8:00 in the morning.

114
00:07:12,678 --> 00:07:14,645
Yo. If we hurry, we can get
those breakfast burritos

115
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,014
- they serve at the courthouse.
- Those are good, Marge.

116
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:20,184
Children's Court of Springfield
is now in session.

117
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:22,519
Apologies.
Divorced dad, no sitter.

118
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:24,655
That must be really tough, Judge.

119
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,790
I raised a turtle by myself.
Pure hell.

120
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:29,259
Milhouse said he'd help,
and he just walked away.

121
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:30,694
Let me look at your file, son.

122
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,496
Your Honor,
I can save you some time.

123
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:35,299
I've done it all, juvie,
state juvie, groovy juvie,

124
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:38,135
the Montessori prison,
Outward and Inward Bound.

125
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,604
So you're down to
fry me or free me.

126
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,807
What can I say?
I'm a widdle dickens.

127
00:07:48,314 --> 00:07:51,515
Well, Bart, based on the
ancient judicial principle

128
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,584
boys will be boys...

129
00:07:56,255 --> 00:07:59,189
- I'm going to hand down a suspended...
- No!

130
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:02,070
Marge, for once, let us
get rich people justice.

131
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:06,330
No. Judge, I love my son, but
he's got a real problem.

132
00:08:06,365 --> 00:08:09,086
He needs to learn the
meaning of consequences.

133
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,004
Bart, I sentence you to 28 days

134
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,574
at the Tomorrow's New Horizons
Addiction Rehab Center

135
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,244
and General Rotten Time Ranch.

136
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:24,481
Mom, how could you
do that to me?

137
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:28,252
- Yeah, Mom.
- Because I love you, Bart.

138
00:08:28,287 --> 00:08:30,220
And a mother's
toughest job is saying...

139
00:08:30,256 --> 00:08:33,023
help me,
my kid has a problem.

140
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,093
I do not! All I ask is,
Dad, while I'm gone,

141
00:08:36,128 --> 00:08:38,228
will you hold onto my
can of peanut brittle?

142
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:40,898
Anything for you, son.

143
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:42,266
Snakes!

144
00:08:42,301 --> 00:08:44,268
Gotcha!

145
00:08:44,303 --> 00:08:45,869
Why you little...!

146
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:51,075
The snakes ate
all the peanut brittle.

147
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,910
I don't know.

148
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:55,112
I don't know
if I did the right thing.

149
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:56,714
Comfort me.

150
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:59,917
Oh, Marge, part of being
a parent is doing things

151
00:08:59,952 --> 00:09:02,553
that'll make your child
never speak to you again.

152
00:09:04,156 --> 00:09:06,256
Oh, no, honey,
I didn't mean never.

153
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:08,025
Definitely on his deathbed.

154
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:11,228
When he's dying.

155
00:09:12,998 --> 00:09:15,933
I had to do it.
I had to do it.

156
00:09:15,968 --> 00:09:18,669
He was out of control.
Look what he did to Krusty.

157
00:09:21,173 --> 00:09:23,474
I feel terrible for his writers.

158
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,976
I beat you

159
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:27,144
if you don't flip sign.

160
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:29,446
Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip!

161
00:09:33,252 --> 00:09:36,887
What are you here for?
To laugh at me?

162
00:09:36,922 --> 00:09:39,156
- No.
- Please laugh at me!

163
00:09:39,191 --> 00:09:41,291
I don't exist
unless you laugh at me!

164
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:45,329
Look what you've done to me!

165
00:09:49,602 --> 00:09:51,468
He looks just like me!

166
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:53,237
And Maggie looks just like Lisa.

167
00:09:53,272 --> 00:09:55,973
And Milhouse's mother looks
just like Milhouse's father.

168
00:09:56,008 --> 00:09:58,275
Why is this universe so lazy?

169
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,676
Never mind that.

170
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:01,578
Krusty, our son's prank
caused this.

171
00:10:01,614 --> 00:10:02,713
We're gonna help you.

172
00:10:02,748 --> 00:10:04,914
Forget it. I'm finished.

173
00:10:06,018 --> 00:10:07,851
- Wait, wait.
- What?

174
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:09,019
You can still work.

175
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:10,287
What if you gave up comedy,

176
00:10:10,322 --> 00:10:12,623
and transitioned
to serious acting?

177
00:10:12,658 --> 00:10:14,158
Impossible.

178
00:10:14,193 --> 00:10:16,360
I've never shown genuine
emotion in my life.

179
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:18,529
I'm even reading this
off a card.

180
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:22,633
Okay, next card.

181
00:10:22,668 --> 00:10:24,535
But seriously,
I gotta speak from the...

182
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,370
next card... heart.

183
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:28,138
I can't be a dramatic actor.

184
00:10:28,174 --> 00:10:30,674
I have all the depth
of a foot bath.

185
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:33,277
Next card. Skip that one.
Next card.

186
00:10:33,312 --> 00:10:35,879
A lot of funny actors have
transitioned to drama.

187
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:37,848
Tom Hanks, Albert Brooks.

188
00:10:37,883 --> 00:10:39,316
I'm not convinced.

189
00:10:39,351 --> 00:10:40,884
- Michael Keaton.
- I'm in.

190
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,686
- Zach Braff.
- Now I'm not so sure.

191
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:45,689
- Bryan Cranston.
- I'm in. And hopeful.

192
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:53,030
Greetings! I am your director,
Llewellyn Sinclair,

193
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:55,532
and you are
the Barbies and Kens

194
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:57,134
whom I shall pose

195
00:10:57,169 --> 00:11:00,070
in my Malibu beach house
of thespic triumph.

196
00:11:00,105 --> 00:11:02,372
My choice for our play
is Arthur Miller's

197
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:04,241
Death of a Salesman.

198
00:11:05,544 --> 00:11:07,477
However,
the rights cost too much,

199
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:10,781
so we'll be doing this knockoff
version, The Salesman's Bad Day.

200
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:14,384
Don't worry,
the text is just Play-Doh

201
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,320
to be extruded through
the Fun Factory

202
00:11:16,355 --> 00:11:18,755
of my Tony Award
watching genius.

203
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:22,059
To play Willie Salesman, please
welcome the man who's taking

204
00:11:22,094 --> 00:11:25,462
a bold leap into
intentional unfunniness,

205
00:11:25,497 --> 00:11:27,898
and giving me a ride
home tonight,

206
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:30,601
and maybe more, hmm?

207
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:32,870
Mr. Herschel Krustofsky.

208
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:35,505
Hey-hey.
Let me see the script.

209
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,741
My line. My line. Garbage.

210
00:11:37,776 --> 00:11:39,109
Garbage. My line.

211
00:11:39,144 --> 00:11:40,510
I don't know.

212
00:11:40,546 --> 00:11:42,112
Should I really be doing this?

213
00:11:42,147 --> 00:11:43,680
I'm an out-of-work has-been

214
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:46,383
whose next logical step
is to take his own life.

215
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:49,586
And that's exactly what
Death of a Salesman is about.

216
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:51,955
I thought this was
The Salesman's Bad Day.

217
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:53,457
And that's exactly
what I said.

218
00:11:53,492 --> 00:11:55,425
Anyone hear different?
I thought not!

219
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:57,527
But Krusty,
the part of Willie Loman,

220
00:11:57,563 --> 00:11:59,696
I mean Salesman,
is perfect for you.

221
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:01,198
You'll just be playing yourself.

222
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:03,634
- Can I play someone I like?
- No.

223
00:12:07,773 --> 00:12:11,642
I know he can't see me, but
can he still feel my love?

224
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:14,378
I'm afraid the glass
blocks that too.

225
00:12:15,915 --> 00:12:19,216
Marge, I promise I will
make your boy whole.

226
00:12:19,251 --> 00:12:21,952
I want to believe that
so much.

227
00:12:21,987 --> 00:12:24,054
I'll never forget
how peaceful he was

228
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:27,624
in those moments before he
took his very first breath.

229
00:12:36,368 --> 00:12:39,269
Bart, you act like you
don't have a problem,

230
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:41,638
but deep down,
you know you need help.

231
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:43,774
No way. I am awesome.

232
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:47,411
Sit down and I'll elaborate.

233
00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:49,813
I think I'll need some help.

234
00:12:49,848 --> 00:12:52,416
Marge, could you come in here?

235
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:54,818
Please, take my seat.

236
00:13:07,032 --> 00:13:09,433
We need to get to
the bottom of this.

237
00:13:09,468 --> 00:13:11,268
Right to the point.

238
00:13:11,303 --> 00:13:12,636
No, no, no!

239
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:15,005
Oh, well, maybe I should try
a different tack.

240
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:21,878
Mom, don't sit down!
I don't want to hurt you.

241
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:25,649
Okay, you just completed
step one, learning empathy.

242
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:29,853
Pop, look.

243
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:32,022
I am losing the weight.

244
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:34,124
Come on, Krusty!

245
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:36,626
There's raw emotion just
beneath your surface.

246
00:13:36,662 --> 00:13:37,961
Frack it!

247
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:39,629
Oh, I don't know, I'm scared.

248
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:41,531
The theater is not for cowards.

249
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:43,667
All I ask for is integrity
and honesty

250
00:13:43,702 --> 00:13:45,202
in The Salesman's Bad Day.

251
00:13:45,237 --> 00:13:46,803
Title may change.

252
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,473
Now, Herschel, summon
that talent you've hidden

253
00:13:49,508 --> 00:13:52,376
from the entire world
for 60 years.

254
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:55,078
I can't!

255
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,351
Hershel, my son, listen
to me and listen good.

256
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:04,087
You are a once-in-a-generation
performer.

257
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:05,489
You think so?

258
00:14:05,524 --> 00:14:07,657
No! I was faking it.

259
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:09,559
And if I can do it, so can you.

260
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:11,828
And now, become a great actor.

261
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:14,164
And now, sense memory.

262
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:15,499
And now, be present.

263
00:14:15,534 --> 00:14:16,700
And articulate!

264
00:14:16,735 --> 00:14:18,235
- And we breathe.
- Oh, okay.

265
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,670
And great actor.

266
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:21,905
I'm sorry, my sons.

267
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,206
Clench butt.

268
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:24,708
I'm finished as a salesman.

269
00:14:24,743 --> 00:14:26,343
Clenchier.

270
00:14:26,378 --> 00:14:28,879
The only thing I have left
worth anything is...

271
00:14:28,914 --> 00:14:30,847
Transport me
to another plane.

272
00:14:30,883 --> 00:14:32,582
My life insurance.

273
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:35,252
But, Pop, that only
pays off if you're...

274
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:36,620
Big pause.

275
00:14:38,624 --> 00:14:40,223
Dead.

276
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:42,359
Your pop is gonna go out
on his route, boys.

277
00:14:42,394 --> 00:14:44,027
One last time.

278
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:45,796
No, Pop. No.

279
00:14:45,831 --> 00:14:48,532
Tell your mother I'm sorry
about the woman in Boston!

280
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:51,868
Also, my death is a metaphor
for American industry!

281
00:14:55,307 --> 00:14:57,040
I'm doing it. I'm doing it!

282
00:14:57,076 --> 00:15:00,477
And I'll be fine, unless I get
those voices in my head.

283
00:15:00,512 --> 00:15:02,946
You can't act.

284
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,317
You're a clown, and that's
all you'll ever be.

285
00:15:07,352 --> 00:15:09,553
And when you die,
they'll be playing this.

286
00:15:09,588 --> 00:15:11,121
No.

287
00:15:11,156 --> 00:15:12,722
No. Stop it.

288
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:14,825
No! No! No!

289
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:18,495
Anything wrong, Krusty?

290
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,730
Only what's tormented me
my entire life.

291
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:22,799
Very good.
See you tomorrow.

292
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:34,049
Reverend, I'm here
for my last step.

293
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:36,617
To make amends for the
rotten things I've done.

294
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:37,751
Oh, fine.

295
00:15:37,786 --> 00:15:40,754
Let me get into uniform.

296
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:42,956
I'm sorry I cut all the
Bible ribbons short

297
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:44,491
so no one could mark
their place.

298
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,792
Why you son of a...

299
00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:53,722
Willie, I'm sorry
I shaved your beard.

300
00:15:53,758 --> 00:15:56,125
I've had to wear
a merkin on me face.

301
00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:00,062
I also had the blades removed
from your lawnmower.

302
00:16:00,097 --> 00:16:01,730
You've just been
riding around.

303
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:03,833
No one interferes
with me mowing!

304
00:16:03,868 --> 00:16:06,135
And I'm sorry I used
your baseball chalker

305
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,870
to write Skinner Sucks.

306
00:16:07,905 --> 00:16:10,472
I'll show you who su...
Wait, you can do that?

307
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:12,074
Please don't encourage me.

308
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:15,711
Thank you for encouraging me.

309
00:16:15,746 --> 00:16:17,580
We're out of chalk.

310
00:16:17,615 --> 00:16:21,217
You know, I had
just completed rehab.

311
00:16:21,252 --> 00:16:23,252
Well, me too.

312
00:16:26,591 --> 00:16:28,157
America loves a lot of things,

313
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:30,426
but I never dreamed a
comeback was one of them.

314
00:16:30,461 --> 00:16:31,627
- Tell me, Krusty.
- No, no.

315
00:16:31,662 --> 00:16:32,895
No more of the K word.

316
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,296
I'm a serious actor now.

317
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:36,232
If only my father could see me.

318
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:39,668
Oh, I see you. Son, you
used to be a putz.

319
00:16:39,704 --> 00:16:41,737
Now you're a putz trying
to be a schmendrick,

320
00:16:41,772 --> 00:16:43,439
which makes you
a schmeckle.

321
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:45,441
Get out of my head!

322
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:49,645
Yet another puff piece
that ends in madness.

323
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,581
I know you lost the love
of Linda Ellerbee

324
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:54,483
while we were launching
the luge

325
00:16:54,518 --> 00:16:55,985
at the Olympics
in Lillehammer.

326
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,686
B-B-B-Brokaw.

327
00:17:01,058 --> 00:17:03,525
Bart Simpson
cured of pranking?

328
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:05,261
I never thought
I'd see it.

329
00:17:05,296 --> 00:17:07,162
And you haven't.
Look up there.

330
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:08,864
Water balloons,
ready to drop.

331
00:17:10,668 --> 00:17:13,969
It's times like this
I'm glad I have eyebrows.

332
00:17:17,742 --> 00:17:20,376
Sweetie, I've never been
prouder of you.

333
00:17:20,411 --> 00:17:25,147
I knew my little bad seed
could bloom into a flower.

334
00:17:25,182 --> 00:17:27,483
You're proud of me?

335
00:17:32,156 --> 00:17:34,356
That's right.
Now go give that speech

336
00:17:34,392 --> 00:17:37,493
and know that sitting in that
audience will be your mother,

337
00:17:37,528 --> 00:17:40,362
who's always believed in you.

338
00:17:46,504 --> 00:17:48,737
Nothing can rain
on my parade today.

339
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:53,542
I... I... I... Run!

340
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,183
Simpson!

341
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:04,553
Motherhood sucks.

342
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:10,492
Boys will be boys.

343
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,397
You can't come in here.

344
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:17,499
This is the boys
will be boys room.

345
00:18:21,405 --> 00:18:24,740
Tonight, you will make
theatrical history.

346
00:18:24,775 --> 00:18:26,709
You'll take a play
that has been seen

347
00:18:26,744 --> 00:18:30,512
all over the world more
times than man can count,

348
00:18:30,548 --> 00:18:32,748
and you will do
the best version ever.

349
00:18:32,783 --> 00:18:35,751
How do I know? Because
I just took six Valiums.

350
00:18:35,786 --> 00:18:38,220
See you outside.

351
00:18:40,091 --> 00:18:42,424
You'll never get rid of me.

352
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,094
You'll always be
a self-hating clown.

353
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:52,034
When I was 17,
I walked into the Amazon.

354
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:54,269
The company, not the river.

355
00:18:54,305 --> 00:18:57,039
And when I was 21,
I walked out.

356
00:18:57,074 --> 00:19:00,976
And, man, was I loaded.

357
00:19:01,012 --> 00:19:03,579
Thank you, Jeff Bezos.

358
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:05,114
Listen to your uncle, boys.

359
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:06,815
He's a great man.

360
00:19:06,851 --> 00:19:08,884
The audience is quiet.
That means you're bombing.

361
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:10,552
Quick, you got to get a laugh.

362
00:19:10,588 --> 00:19:12,121
Drop your pants,
show your fanny.

363
00:19:12,156 --> 00:19:13,622
You know,
your A material.

364
00:19:13,657 --> 00:19:15,290
Get out of my head.

365
00:19:15,326 --> 00:19:17,159
I... am...

366
00:19:17,194 --> 00:19:18,761
a serious actor!

367
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:23,432
Laughs? I'm getting laughs.

368
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:25,834
- And not from a machine.
- Go with it.

369
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,336
<i>I'm a salesman</i>

370
00:19:27,371 --> 00:19:28,971
<i>A dying salesman</i>

371
00:19:29,006 --> 00:19:30,439
<i>I'm Willie Loman</i>

372
00:19:30,474 --> 00:19:31,907
<i>Just watch me go, man</i>

373
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:33,342
<i>I'm gonna suck</i>

374
00:19:33,377 --> 00:19:35,511
<i>That old gas pipe</i>

375
00:19:35,546 --> 00:19:37,312
<i>Pipe, pipe</i>

376
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:41,950
Whatever doesn't kill me
makes the play longer.

377
00:19:46,557 --> 00:19:48,490
This play will run forever.

378
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:50,659
Okay, but now
that I'm big again,

379
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:53,095
I can't work Tuesdays,
Thursdays,

380
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,629
the month of July, or Toronto
Raptors' home games.

381
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,296
I'm the Spike Lee of that team.

382
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,566
Standard exemptions.
I love it.

383
00:20:02,884 --> 00:20:05,179
<i>He fails at everything he can</i>

384
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:07,306
<i>His sons can't stand their old man</i>

385
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,664
<i>It's sell, sell, sell</i>

386
00:20:08,664 --> 00:20:11,590
<i>Till he dies, dies, dies</i>

387
00:20:11,694 --> 00:20:14,715
<i>In a car crash</i>

388
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:16,993
All's well that ends well.

389
00:20:16,993 --> 00:20:19,604
How did it end well?
He's ruining my play.

390
00:20:19,604 --> 00:20:22,369
Well, don't worry. You've got
plenty of other good plays.

391
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:24,192
Oh, wait. You don't.

392
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,685
Hey, I'm America's
greatest playwright.

393
00:20:26,732 --> 00:20:28,537
Exactly.
