{\an8}Excuse me?

{\an8}I'm having trouble

11
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,122
{\an8}Okay, let me check your
settings, your photos.

12
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,252
{\an8}I don't see
why you need to do that.

13
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,499
{\an8}Wow, that guy's really fat.

14
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,002
{\an8}That's my husband! Oh!

15
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,674
{\an8}Let me talk

{\an8}Oh, I'm not a salesman.

17
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,764
{\an8}I'm just a guy in a blue shirt.

{\an8}Oh!

19
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,680
{\an8}Okay, Maggie, from now on,

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,350
{\an8}we only talk to people at stores
with name tags.

21
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,519
{\an8}I've said it before,
but this time, I mean it.

{\an8}-(tires screech)
-(gasps) What happened?

23
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,689
{\an8}Oh, someone snuck
into the construction site,

24
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,190
{\an8}stole a bulldozer and went
joyriding all over town.

{\an8}I can't stand

29
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,325
{\an8}Now I've got everything I need
to convict your boy,

30
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,126
{\an8}except for motive,
means, and opportunity.

31
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,751
{\an8}You also have no evidence.

32
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,337
{\an8}That's implied!

33
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,092
{\an8}So, I'm remanding him...

34
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,434
{\an8}Is that a word-- "remanding"?

35
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,299
{\an8}Yeah, uh, to your custody.

36
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,845
{\an8}Maybe a mother can find out
what a police chief can't.

{\an8}Aw, what's her name?

49
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:10,208
{\an8}Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.
We just call her Baz.

50
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,256
{\an8}Now it's time for her Christian
doggy training.

51
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,720
{\an8}This will be interesting.

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,510
{\an8}Sit. Kneel.

53
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,973
{\an8}Pray. Play dead.

54
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,064
{\an8}Now resurrect.

55
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,810
{\an8}And sit in glory
at the right hand of Todd.

56
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,400
{\an8}Finally,
a religion that makes sense.

57
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,570
{\an8}All right, Mr. Smarty,
what went on back there?

58
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,940
{\an8}Mom, why is it
the only time you call me smart

59
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,397
{\an8}is when you're being sarcastic?

60
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,107
{\an8}Really? Do I do that?

61
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,947
{\an8}Because I really shouldn't.

62
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,742
{\an8}You're the one
in trouble here, bub!

63
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,247
Why don't you think about
what you just did?

64
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,169
Why don't you think about
what <i>you</i> just did?

65
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,012
Hmm.

66
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,300
I will live with that forever,

67
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,934
but this is about you.

68
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,101
I swear to you on my mother's grave,
I didn't do a thing!

69
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,931
Sorry, sorry.

70
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,396
So, the Flanderses got a new dog,
and it knows my name!

71
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,479
Good for you, little girl!

72
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,066
Marge, Bart, I've noticed

73
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,241
neither of you
have said a word all meal.

74
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,070
Are there feelings
going unexpressed here?

75
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,066
Because if there are...

76
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,748
I believe someone at this table
isn't telling us the truth.

77
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,499
Master Bart Simpson!

78
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,960
Kids, could you
excuse us for a moment?

79
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,677
Your mother and I need
to have an adult conversation.

80
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,469
What'd he do?
What'd he do? (laughs)

81
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,802
Your son stole a bulldozer.

82
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,257
-How do you know?
-A mother knows.

83
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,348
-Does a wife know things?
-Yes.

84
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,773
(shrieks)

85
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,651
I believe
we were talking about Bart.

86
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,018
I'm afraid I don't know
how to handle him anymore.

87
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,685
Oh, Bart's ten.
He's too old to be <i>handled.</i>

88
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,736
We should just think of excuses
for when he goes bonkers.

89
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,280
Oh. "Acne medicine."

90
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,034
When in doubt,
blame the acne medicine.

91
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,655
No, I'm not giving up on Bart,

92
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,742
just like I didn't
give up on our marriage

93
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,787
when you quit your job to start
the North American Sumo League.

94
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,922
The NASL
would have made money

95
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:14,049
if <i>someone</i> had washed
a few sumo loincloths for me!

96
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:17,968
I said I would do yours,
but not the whole dojo.

97
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,802
Bart, get in here!

98
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,428
Look me in the eye and tell me

99
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,056
you know nothing
about that bulldozer.

100
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,443
I know nothing
about that bulldozer.

101
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,981
<i>MARGE:</i>
<i>This is bad.</i>

102
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,154
<i>He can't tell his mother</i>
<i>what he does.</i>

103
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,443
<i>Where will that lead?</i>

104
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,397
(with Irish accent)
Any last words, boyo?

105
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,857
I know nothing
about that bulldozer.

106
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,117
-Give him the juice!
-(electricity crackling)

107
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,529
(laughs)

108
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,077
Which one's yours?

109
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,660
The one being electrocuted!

110
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,285
I've never seen
an eyeball pop so fast.

111
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,958
I wish I could
tell you about that bulldozer,

112
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,923
but how can I explain something
I know nothing about?

113
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,715
I am not cable news.

114
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,588
Stop it! Stop it!

115
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,295
Stop lying right now!

116
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,295
But-- But you have to believe me.

117
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,807
You're my mom!

118
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:09,228
-All right, I will believe you on this.
-Smart.

119
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,729
But until then,
I'm going to keep my eye on you.

120
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,151
All the time.

121
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,439
All the time?

122
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,072
How are you gonna
change Maggie?

123
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,413
Eh, close enough.

124
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,195
OTTO:
All aboard.

125
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,076
Mom, what are you doing?

126
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,423
I told you, to trust you,
I have to watch you.

127
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,129
All the time.

128
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,554
Mmm.

129
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,220
You're gonna be riding this bus?

130
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,889
I'm going to be watching my son
wherever he goes.

131
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,179
Then you'd better go out the back,

132
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,352
'cause that's where he went.

133
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,274
D'oh!

134
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,687
(barking)

135
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:02,198
Oh, you must be Flanders' new dog.

136
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,108
I just want to apologize in advance

137
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,777
for the things
I'm gonna blame on you.

138
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,195
Homer, meet Baz.

139
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,123
-(barking)
-(laughing)

140
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,253
Oh, sorry, Flanders.

141
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,002
I'm sure she has fun with you.

142
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,964
(laughs)
She sure likes you.

143
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,424
Must be the cheeseburgers
in your sweat.

144
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,585
Cheeseburgers in my sweat.
Really?

145
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:27,684
Now, apparently,
I have <i>cheeseburgers</i> in my sweat.

146
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,429
I can leave any time, Bart.

147
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,188
Just tell me what happened
with that bulldozer.

148
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,190
-Next question.
-Fine.

149
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,192
Which papers
on the walls are yours?

150
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,864
None of them.

151
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,243
Is that the boy
who copies off you?

152
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,360
<i>I</i> copy off <i>him?!</i>

153
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:51,287
What brand of poppycock
is this miscreant feeding you, madam?

154
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,079
Okay, Mom, I admit it.

155
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,792
There's a few lies I told you
that you're gonna find out.

156
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,923
Simpson,
you said your mother was dead.

157
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,750
(groans)

158
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,206
She's become a zombie! Run!

159
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,759
(humming)

160
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,925
Mom, churros are good for you.

161
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,472
They're ethnic.

162
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,386
Hey, Simpson,
you need your mommy

163
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,274
to cut your carrots for you?

164
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,151
He can cut his own carrots.

165
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,808
Baby carrots, 'cause he's a baby!

166
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,437
(laughter)

167
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,435
Brilliant!

168
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,696
Mom, Dad does plenty of stuff
you don't like.

169
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,278
Why don't you follow him?

170
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,373
Following an adult is creepy.

171
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,779
Following your kid is parenting.

172
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,158
I'm so lucky my mom's
in Gainesboro, Florida...

173
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,786
I think.

174
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,287
Is my mom still outside?

175
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,666
She's swinging on a swing,
and Ralph's pushing her.

176
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,974
RALPH:
Hello! Good-bye!

177
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,628
Hello!
Good-bye!

178
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,337

I am never leaving this tube.

182
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,270
Sorry, lad.
You've been in more than five minutes,

183
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,813
so I've got to remove you.

184
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:04,437

the greatest weapon at me disposal.

185

Scotland! 1,200 years,

188
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,866

189
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,371
(resumes playing)

190
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,285
(loud gulping)

191
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,502
Man. (gulps)

192
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,923
Staying on this all-pork-chop diet
is easier than I thought.

193
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,553
That diet doesn't work.

194
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,920
You have to give it a year.

195
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,797
So, how was school today?

196
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,974
Well, actually,

197
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,472
I caused quite a ruckus
in the nurse's office

198
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,644
by pointing out they
weren't putting fresh paper

199
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,393
on the lay-down table.

200
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,555
Very good, sweetie.
Could you lean back?

201
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,154
I have to focus on your brother.

202
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,769
Sure, sure.
No need to worry about Lisa.

203
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,316
Lisa's always fine.

204
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,569

Aw. What are you doing here?

208
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,449
I bet you escaped,
and now Flanders is worried sick.

209
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,618
I should call him...
after I scratch your tummy!

210
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,166
That's right!

211
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,170
Who likes their tummy scratched
while Flanders is worried sick?

212
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,013
You do! You do!
Yes, you do!

213
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,799
Oh, he doesn't know where you are.

214
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,262
(laughing)
Yes, he's probably crying right now.

215

(growling)

216
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,886
Come on, boy.
We'll go to my room.

217
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,102
I can play jazz,
or give you a bath, or...

218

219
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,098

No one cares about the middle child.

223
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,992
Never, ever gonna change.

224
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,820
Lisa, can I talk to you?

225
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,525
Oh, here it is, the quick check-in

226
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,485
every two years
just like clockwork.

227
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,156
All right, let me speak to you
in a language you'll understand.

228
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,786
(muttering) Oh, boy, oh, boy,
Lisa never gets it.

229
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,173
She's great,
and everyone knows that.

230
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,920
Oh, man, trying to stay mad.

It's not really like him.

She's my favorite child.

234
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,090
Oh, now he's pulling out
the big guns.

235
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,716
Oh, I don't want to pout anymore.

236
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,813
If he offers me ice cream,
I'm gonna break.

237
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:58,968
-You want some ice cream?
-Yes!

238

Whoo-hoo!

239
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,636
LISA: I knew he was gonna break.
I'm gonna write a song.

HOMER:
That makes them happy,

241
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,268

He's not your uncle!

246
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,406

He's gonna plant it soon.

262
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,728
He just has to get
enough money together

263
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,725
to buy a pack of apple seeds.

264
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,687
Just hand me the Mountain Doo.

what I've been planning.

353
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,790
(à la Mayor Quimby)
Er, uh,

354
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,120
welcome to our celebration
of, er, uh,

355
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,626
our city's lame-o sign.

356
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,459
You nailed him!

357
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,774
-"Fie"?
-Yeah. Look it up.

358
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,808
"Used to express disgust or outrage"?

359
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,233
(gasps)
That's the worst F-word there is!

360
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,685
Bart, I'm not butting in anymore,

361
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,074
so you don't have to hide things
under your blanky.

362
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,901
It isn't a blanky anymore.

363
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,656
Hasn't been for three months!

364
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,568
So, we want you to have our dog.

365
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:53,077
You just give her love,
and I'll pay for all the shots.

366
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,080
Shots?
What, is she going to India?

367
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,792
Bye, Baz.

368
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,343
(barks)

369
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,590
(sniffling)

370
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,336
<i>HOMER:</i>
<i>Aw, geez, I can't stand</i>

371
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,344
<i>to see Flanders sad.</i>

372
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,676
<i>Or happy.</i>

373
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,891
<i>Pretty much can't stand</i>
<i>to see Flanders.</i>

374
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,772
<i>But he'll need something</i>
<i>to cheer him up</i>

375
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,098
<i>when his boys run away.</i>

376
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,274
You know what, Flanders?

377
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,942
I think you should take her back.

378
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,770
Homer, don't be crazy.

379
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,815
Look at that tail wag for you.

380
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,279
Have you seen what it does for me?

381
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,741
No, no, no.
To her, I'm just another dog.

382
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,833
A dog she's in love with
but can never have.

383
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,289
But she's only got one of you,
Flanders--

384
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,370
the guy who will
take care of her forever.

385
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,746
Oh, thank you, Homer.

386
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,424
This has been the happiest
dog day afternoon ever.

387
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,553
Aw...

388
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,716
I'm still not sure-- did you do
that bulldozer thing before?

389
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,965
You were there.
Maybe when I hit you with the blade,

390
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,227
you forgot some stuff.

391
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,438
I was trying to get your attention,

392
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,978
but it was heavier than I thought.

393
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,151
Well, no one fought more
than Cummings and McLeod

394
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,940
when they invented the bulldozer.

395
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,904
Even the name "bulldozer"
was a great source of...

396
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:08,985
Aah!

397
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,699
Bart, I can't do this.

398
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:14,489
No offense,
but I have a mother who still loves me.

399
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,912
QUIMBY: We come here today
to honor this sign,

400
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,078
which was purchased,
letter by letter,

401
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,377
from other failed towns.

402
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,843
Huh?

403
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,422
Aw, stupid Mom.

404
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,967
Stuck something in my backpack.

405
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,971
Typical.

406
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,349
Oh, man, she makes good chicken.

407
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,852
<i>You're the best boy a mom could want.</i>

408
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,520
<i>I've failed as a mother!</i>

409
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,895
I'm growing a conscience!

410
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,487
I've got to change this prank.

411
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,410
Much better.

412
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,747
(creaking)

413
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,461
Our iconic sign is aquiver!

414
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,922
(nervous chuckle)
Everyone remain calm.

415
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,053
This is a part of the show.

416
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,380
(quietly)
VIPs, follow me.

417
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,215
Much better.

418
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,722
I don't seen nothing wrong.

419
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,439
Better to die a VIP

420
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,059
than to live
as an ordinary American citizen.

421
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,435
SKINNER:
It says "F-D."

422
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,488
It's a tribute to the fire department.

423
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,281
(crowd cheers)

424
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,445
The chili-cooking saints of the city!

425
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,285
It's true--
we do love our chili.

426
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,410
The secret is stirring it.

427
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,917
I'm a huge fan.
That's why I wear suspenders

428
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,129
and start little fires here and there.

429
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,130
(panting) Mom, Mom...

430
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,092
I learned there's a line I won't cross,

431
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,172
and it's 'cause of you and your chicken.

432
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,638
That woman does make
convincing chicken.

433
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,718
You're the best boy a mother could want...

434
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,385
if you tell me
about the bulldozer.

435
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,064
All right.
It was me.

436
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,103
(gasps)
Why, you little...

437
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,186
(quiet grunting)

438
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,862
(chuckles)

439
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,440
Yeah, harder to strangle
than it looks, isn't it, Marge?

440
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,777
Oh...

441
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,162
And you're under arrest.

442
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,278
-How'd you figure it out?
-I heard you say it.

443
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,946
The only way I solve any crime.

444
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,954
You don't have to stop hugging.

445
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,382
(coughing)

446
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,499
So you see, Mom,

447
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,496
because of the wrinkled
lay-down paper

448
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,418
in the nurse's office,
I got mono.

449
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,967
You really should've kept
your eyes on that ball.

450
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,261
Oh, all these problems.

451
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,385
You kids are like whack-a-moles.

452
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,102
Oh, that reminds me.

453
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,393
Maggie hurt herself
playing Whack-A-Mole.

454
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,636
Aw.

455
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,452
Come here, you.

456
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,450
Come here.
I know I've been having my fun elsewhere,

457
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,413
and no one could blame you
if you didn't take me back,

458
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,664
but if you'll have me,
I'll take you

459
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:10,287
on the longest walk of your life!

460
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,085
No hills.

461
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,129
Dogs-- so easy to make up with.
