{\an8}Yes, but what is it?

79
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,527
{\an8}Crowdfunding is when lots of people

80
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,368
{\an8}give you small amounts of money

81
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,503

Who's the band?

177
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,423
They're an adorable
Australian boy band,

178
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,587
and you can't really understand
what they're saying.

179

But who cares?

180
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,014
I understand.

181
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,596
That's how I felt about Crocodile Dundee.

182
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,102
I will never forgive you

183
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,103

It all went south for me
when I got that D.U.I.

No, but you made a fool

Yeah, but it was weird.

307
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,491
At first she was nice to me,

308
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,616
but then when the band came,
she wouldn't let me say a word.

309
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,169
Uh, listen, sweetie.

310
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,879
Let me tell you a fact of life.

311
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,839
The world is full of wonderful,
priceless experiences,

312
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,131
and I can't give you any of them.

313
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,926
But this girl can.

314
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,100
So it doesn't matter if she talks to you,

315
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,060
looks at you,
or is disrespectful to your father.

316
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,602
She is your best friend.

00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,727

00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,204
Did you ever sit in the back of anything?

324
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,867
Just a space shuttle, man.

325
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,575
My one regret
is I was too drunk to drive.

326
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,956

Oh-oh, oh-oh, bam!

327
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,594

333
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,434
Sorry,
that's too long without me talking.

335
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,348
So what do I do now?!

336
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,606
Don't worry. Harper,
what's your favorite starving wild animal?

337
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,689
Crocodile?

338

341
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,449
to have a man take care
of your every need?

342
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,538
I've thought about it a lot, but no.

343
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,754
How come you're so quiet?

344
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,464
Did he switch your brain
with a rabbit's?

345
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,174
'Cause that means somewhere
there is one annoying rabbit.

346
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,665
Shut up.

347
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,676
I just keep thinking about
the way Harper cut me off.

348
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,259
It's kind of weird.

349
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,764
Yeah, that was kind of weird.

350
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,137
I'd have said something for sure,

351
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,353
