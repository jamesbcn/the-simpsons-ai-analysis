I can barely remember the starting lineup

175
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,679
of the 1961 Chicago Blackhawks.

176
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,484
Uh, Bobby Hull, Al Arbour,

177
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,479
Ed Litzenberger, captain,

178
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,191
Stan Mikita, and... that's all.

179
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,072
Also, Dollard St. Laurent.

180
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,938
But not you.

181
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,145
I'm sorry, sir.

182
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,116
(moans)

183
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,329
Okay, people, what have you got?

184
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,161
We're being killed in the ratings
by the morning announcements.

185

<i>SKINNER (on P.A.): Attention,</i>

186
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,173
the bus that took 30 kids
on a "field trip"

187
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,841
was not from this school.

188
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,299
If anyone's mom can pick up
30 students in South Springfield,

189
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,221
it would be much appreciated. Ow!

190
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,760
Why didn't we break that story?!

191
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,514
Damn it, we're even being beaten
by Jimbo's podcast.

192
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,228
Today on <i>Left, Right and Center,</i>
we'll discuss whether

193
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,769
to punch someone in the left,
right, or center.

194
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,613
Our special guest today

195
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,938
is upside-down nerd,
Milhouse Van Houten.

196
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,935
Thanks for having me back.

197
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,447
Aren't we just supposed to do
the stories we want

198
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,319
and not worry about ratings?

199
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,406
That's kindergarten talk.

200
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,331
This is professional fourth-grade radio.

201
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,911

202
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:25,286
Meeting's over.
I've got to put the balls back in.

203
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,924
I'm the smartest ball in the bag.

204
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,252
(crow caws)

205
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,627
You could be replaced,
and it wouldn't be hard.

206
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,764
A cinder block with a stretched-out belt

207
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,431
-would do the trick.

I still don't remember you, man.

233

LISA: Here at Springfield Elementary,

234
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,632
detention has many names.

235
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,013
Prankatraz, The Skinner Sheraton,

236

237

Three Elevenworth, Little Devil's Island,

238
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,430
and Dead Man Chalking.

239
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:07,894
And I am here with the legendary
nurple purpler Nelson Muntz.

240
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,897
-Yo.
-Nelson, let me get right to it.

241
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,520
Haw haw!

242
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,566
Where did that come from?

243
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,110
Um... wow.

244
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,953
First of all, great question.

245
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:21,118
I guess I just saw a jerk
doing something lame,

246
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,448
and I wanted to make the dope
feel like a dingus.

247
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,454
Well, Mr. Muntz,
I just happen to have

248
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,997
one of those "dingi" right here.

249
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,922
Milhouse, how does it feel
to get a full Nelson?

250
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,382
The first "haw" isn't that bad.

251
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,223
But the second one is devastating.

252
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,629
Wow! Wow!

253
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,928
Sorry, Lisa.

254
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,051
Funding has run out
for our radio station.

255
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,968
I'm, uh, gonna have to
take back your hat.

256
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,476
-What?!
-Jeff and Becky broke up!

257
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,229
Just before the story of the year!

258
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,023
(Homer humming)

259
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,277
Hmm?

260
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,778
What's wrong, sweetie?

261
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,900
They took away my radio station,

262
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,407
which was the only source of news
in a 50-foot area.

263
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,575
You could come with me
to the hot dog stand

264
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,160
and do the word search
on the kids' menu.

265
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,996
Do they have diagonals?

266
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,671
Diagonals!

267
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,590
That's where "race car" was hiding.

268
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,421
Oh, no, the hot dog stand is closed!

269
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,508

273
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,652
We should help that man. He's choking.

274
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,478
I remember when you used
to help me when I was choking.

275
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,984
Why don't you ask the girl
at the hiking store?

276
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,147
I gave her my number
because I was ordering boots.

277
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,794
Don't let it be forgot
that on this shining spot

278
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,909
was a place I really ate a lot.

279
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:56,877
I don't see how you can
blame a man of 97 for retiring.

280
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,551
-I thought we were the same age.
-So did I.

281
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,470
Well, I hope you didn't
sell it to some clown.

283
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,895
Here's a check.
Welcome to the Krusty Burger family.

284
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,864
And since we're family, we don't talk!

285
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,236
Next problem.

286
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,702
Oh! What else are you gonna change?

287
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:31,253
We're going to keep everything
that makes Deuce's Caboose great.

288
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,248
Like the hot dogs and the caboose?

289
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,670
No. God, no.

290
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,748
We're already talking to C-list actors

291
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,594

You realize this will be
my childhood memory,

304
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,829
and maybe not so precious?

305
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,293
-That's a problem for grown-up Lisa.
-All right, then.

We shall overeat!

348
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,704
(dramatic music playing)

349
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,871
ALL: Aw.

350
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,956
(dramatic music playing)

351
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,393
-ALL: Yay!
-D'oh!

352
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,808
I'm sorry, Dad. It's over.

353
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,647
No, it's not.

354
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,284
(all gasping)

355
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,162
Krusty, run regular.

356
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,619
I forgot how! (grunts)

357
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,540
(Homer grunting)

358
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,580
(screams)

359
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,213
-(creaking)
-Oh.

360
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,250
-(gasps)
-So that's what it's for.

361
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,801
No! I can't let my Little H-Dog die!

362
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,051
(gasps) You do remember me.

363
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:16,303
I never forgot you. How could I?

364
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,256
-(creaking)
-You were such a sweet,

365
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,557
sad little boy, and I failed you.

366
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,142
-No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

367
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,648
You needed a father,
and all I could give you

368
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,820
was steamed tubes
filled with chicken asses.

369
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,400
But I love those chicken asses!

370
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,066
I love... you.

371
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,825
(both crying)

372
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:41,248
Your chili dogs didn't get me
through my childhood. You did!

373
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:45,208
Suddenly this hot dog-covered
locomotive seems like a joke!

374
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,830
Take my hand, son.

375
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,547
It's strong from turning a can opener.

376
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,298
Your chili was store-bought?!

377
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,220
I didn't say I paid for it.

378
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,019
(explosion)

379
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:07,151
-Mmm!
-Ooh!

380
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,979
-Oh!
-Oh, yeah.

381
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,524
You're a hero, Dad!

382
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,857
They're calling you
Public Elephant Number One!

383
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:16,243
{\an8}Well, I guess that's better than
"Local Man Cut Out of Dressing Room."

384
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,871
{\an8}It sure is, Dad. It sure is.

385
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,003
Chief, why are you letting him leave?

386
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,658
He just committed a series
of serious crimes.

387
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,707
Forget it, Lou. It's Chili Town.

389
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,021
Why does the moon need sunglasses?

390
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,480
Ah, same reason cops wear 'em--
to be cool.

391
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,953
Gentlemen, I'm-a so tired
of all of the bad blood

392
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,449
between our companies.

393
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,530
Can't we have a-piece... of pizza?

394
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,737
What are you doing?!

395
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,236
You fools!

396
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,828
I'm a real person in here!
